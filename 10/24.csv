machine learning. Naive measures such as last-layer scores are well-known to
yield overconfident estimates in the context of overparametrized neural
networks. Several methods, ranging from temperature scaling to different
Bayesian treatments of neural networks, have been proposed to mitigate
overconfidence, most often supported by the numerical observation that they
yield better calibrated uncertainty measures. In this work, we provide a sharp
comparison between popular uncertainty measures for binary classification in a
mathematically tractable model for overparametrized neural networks: the random
features model. We discuss a trade-off between classification accuracy and
calibration, unveiling a double descent like behavior in the calibration curve
of optimally regularized estimators as a function of overparametrization. This
is in contrast with the empirical Bayes method, which we show to be well
calibrated in our setting despite the higher generalization error and
overparametrization.

particles in open exchange with their external milieu. Particles are defined by
a particular partition, in which internal states are individuated from external
states by active and sensory blanket states. The variational principle at hand
allows one to interpret internal dynamics - of certain kinds of particles - as
inferring external states that are hidden behind blanket states. We consider
different kinds of particles, and to what extent they can be imbued with an
elementary form of inference or sentience. Specifically, we consider the
distinction between dissipative and conservative particles, inert and active
particles and, finally, ordinary and strange particles. Strange particles (look
as if they) infer their own actions, endowing them with apparent autonomy or
agency. In short - of the kinds of particles afforded by a particular partition

Seeding a disturbance vector in the hash mapping to obtain a successful

entangled quantum states for concurrent seeding of candidate disturbance
vectors, out of which the one entailing collision is selected through a
combination of quantum search, phase gating, diffusion gating, and information
feedbacks from classical computing machinery. The complexity reduction is shown
to be on the order of $\mathcal{O}(2^{n/2+1})$ where $n$ is the number of

its semantic consistency can be decomposed accordingly. The semantic

Pareto-optimal candidates where one objective cannot be improved without
worsening another. Moreover, in practice, these objectives are often
under-specified, making the diversity of candidates a key consideration. The
existing multi-objective optimization methods focus predominantly on covering
the Pareto front, failing to capture diversity in the space of candidates.
Motivated by the success of GFlowNets for generation of diverse candidates in a
single objective setting, in this paper we consider Multi-Objective GFlowNets
(MOGFNs). MOGFNs consist of a novel Conditional GFlowNet which models a family
of single-objective sub-problems derived by decomposing the multi-objective

different form of stationary flow. Comparing these, we construct Poisson maps,
which, being non-canonical, give rise to bi-Hamiltonian representations of the
stationary flows. An alternative approach is to use the Miura maps, which we do
in the case of the DWW hierarchy, which has two ''modifications''. This
structure gives us 3 sequences of Poisson related stationary flows. We use the
Poisson maps to build a tri-Hamiltonian representation of each of the three
stationary hierarchies. One of the Hamiltonian representations allows a
multi-component squared eigenfunction expansion, which gives $N$ degrees of

the stationary flows is derived from the coupled KdV matrices. In the case of 3
degrees of freedom, we give a generalisation of our Lax matrices and
Hamiltonian functions, which allows a connection with the rational
Calogero-Moser (CM) system. This gives a coupling of the CM system with other

by computing omni-directional bipolar voltages and applying Gaussian Process
Regression based interpolation to derive the atrial fibrillation map. The
proposed method is evaluated on a test cohort of 7 male patients, and a total

teacher model's behavior, e.g., network response, to a student model. The
network response serves as additional supervision to formulate the machine
domain, which uses the data collected from the human domain as a transfer set.
Traditional KD methods hold an underlying assumption that the data collected in
both human domain and machine domain are both independent and identically
distributed (IID). We point out that this naive assumption is unrealistic and
there is indeed a transfer gap between the two domains. Although the gap offers
the student model external knowledge from the machine domain, the imbalanced
teacher knowledge would make us incorrectly estimate how much to transfer from
teacher to student per sample on the non-IID transfer set. To tackle this
challenge, we propose Inverse Probability Weighting Distillation (IPWD) that
estimates the propensity score of a training sample belonging to the machine
domain, and assigns its inverse amount to compensate for under-represented
samples. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of
IPWD for both two-stage distillation and one-stage self-distillation.

and prove a multivariate central limit theorem (CLT). The scattering intensity
is then used as the standard estimator of the structure factor. The above CLT
holds for a preferably large class of point processes, and whenever this is the

Hence, we can use the likelihood ratio principle to test for hyperuniformity.
Remarkably, the asymptotic distribution of the resulting test statistic is
universal under the null hypothesis of hyperuniformity. We obtain its explicit
form from simulations with very high accuracy. The novel test precisely keeps a
nominal significance level for hyperuniform models, and it rejects
non-hyperuniform examples with high power even in borderline cases. Moreover,
it does so given only a single sample with a practically relevant system size.

advantage of current achievements. Due to a combination of factors, including
time, resources, and skills, businesses tend to apply pragmatism into their AI
workflows. Hence, they concentrate more on outcomes, e.g. delivery, shipping,
releases, and features, and adopt high-level working production solutions,
where possible. Among the features thought to be helpful for translators are
sentence-level and word-level translation auto-suggestion and auto-completion.
Suggesting alternatives can inspire translators and limit their need to refer
to external resources, which hopefully boosts their productivity. This work
describes our submissions to WMT's shared task on word-level auto-completion,
for the Chinese-to-English, English-to-Chinese, German-to-English, and
English-to-German language directions. We investigate the possibility of using
pre-trained models and out-of-the-box features from available libraries. We
employ random sampling to generate diverse alternatives, which reveals good

model, and the objective function is quadratic. For this setting, the optimal
controller is obtained in closed form by the separation principle. However, in
practice, the underlying system dynamics often cannot be faithfully captured by
a fully known linear Gaussian SS model, limiting its performance. Here, we
present LQGNet, a stochastic controller that leverages data to operate under
partially known dynamics. LQGNet augments the state tracking module of
separation-based control with a dedicated trainable algorithm. The resulting
system preserves the operation of classic LQG control while learning to cope
with partially known SS models without having to fully identify the dynamics.
We empirically show that LQGNet outperforms classic stochastic control by
overcoming mismatched SS models.

The rules comprise affine droop control augmented with a deadband and
saturation regions. Nonetheless, selecting the shape of these rules is not an

To this end, this work develops a novel methodology for customizing Volt/VAR

the utility every few hours depending on anticipated demand and solar

designed to improve the feeder's voltage profile, comply with IEEE 1547

The stability region is inner approximated by a polytope and the rules are
judiciously parameterized so their feasible set is convex. Numerical tests
using real-world data on the IEEE 141-bus feeder corroborate the scalability of
the methodology and its explore the trade-offs of Volt/VAR control with

methods have attracted surging research interest. We investigate the global
convergence of natural policy gradient (NPG) algorithms in multi-agent
learning. We first show that vanilla NPG may not have parameter convergence,
i.e., the convergence of the vector that parameterizes the policy, even when
the costs are regularized (which enabled strong convergence guarantees in the
policy space in the literature). This non-convergence of parameters leads to
stability issues in learning, which becomes especially relevant in the function
approximation setting, where we can only operate on low-dimensional parameters,
instead of the high-dimensional policy. We then propose variants of the NPG
algorithm, for several standard multi-agent learning scenarios: two-player
zero-sum matrix and Markov games, and multi-player monotone games, with global
last-iterate parameter convergence guarantees. We also generalize the results
to certain function approximation settings. Note that in our algorithms, the
agents take symmetric roles. Our results might also be of independent interest
for solving nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization problems with certain
structures. Simulations are also provided to corroborate our theoretical
findings.

nickelates has been mostly perceived to be unconventional and originated from
the Ni $d$-electrons due to its analog to cuprate superconductors. The
conventional mechanism for superconductivity - phonon-mediated pairing - was
presumably ruled out because density functional theory (DFT) calculations
reported a very weak electron-phonon coupling in the nickelates. Here, by
including electron self-energy effects on the electronic structure and
electron-phonon coupling (with $\textit{ab initio}$ $GW$ calculations), we
discover that infinite-layer Nd$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ is a dominantly
two-gap phonon-mediated superconductor. We show electron correlations alter the
character of its multi-band Fermi surface and also strongly enhance the
electron-phonon coupling, leading to a large $T_c$ in agreement with

enhanced by an unprecedented factor of 5.5 as compared to DFT. Solutions of the
anisotropic Eliashberg equations yield two dominant $s$-wave gaps - a large gap
on states of rare-earth Nd $d$-electron and interstitial orbital characters but
a small gap on those of transition-metal Ni $d$-electron character. The
superconducting quasiparticle density of states prominently reflects the
two-gap nature and explains well tunneling experiments. Our results demonstrate
that the phonon mechanism accounts for superconductivity in the nickelates,
revealing an unforeseen two-gap $s$-wave nature as well as providing new

due to its chaotic behavior. We developed a patient-specific computational
heart model that can accurately reproduce the activation patterns to help in
localizing these triggers and sources. Our model has high spatial resolution,
with whole-atrium temporal synchronous activity, and has patient-specific
accurate electrophysiological activation patterns. A total of 15 patients data
were processed: 8 in sinus rhythm, 6 in atrial flutter and 1 in atrial
tachycardia. For resolution, the average simulation geometry voxel is a cube of
2.47 mm length. For synchrony, the model takes in about 1,500 local electrogram
recordings, optimally fits parameters to the individual's atrium geometry and
then generates whole-atrium activation patterns. For accuracy, the average
local activation time error is 5.47 ms for sinus rhythm, 10.97 ms for flutter

splines, we use these models to conduct the most comprehensive data-driven
investigation of the BBH population to date, simultaneously fitting
non-parametric models for the BBH mass ratio, spin magnitude and misalignment,
and redshift distributions. With GWTC-3, we report the same features previously
recovered with similarly flexible models of the mass distribution, most notably
the peaks in merger rates at primary masses of ${\sim}10\,M_\odot$ and
${\sim}35\,M_\odot$. Our model reports a suppressed merger rate at low primary
masses and a mass ratio distribution consistent with a power law. We infer a
distribution for primary spin misalignments that peaks away from alignment,
supporting conclusions of recent work. We find broad agreement with the
previous inferences of the spin magnitude distribution: the majority of BBH
spins are small ($a<0.5$), the distribution peaks at $a\sim0.2$, and there is
mild support for a non-spinning subpopulation, which may be resolved with
larger catalogs. With a modulated power law describing the BBH merger rate's
evolution in redshift, we see hints of the rate evolution either flattening or
decreasing at $z\sim0.2-0.5$, but the full distribution remains entirely
consistent with a monotonically increasing power law. We conclude with a
discussion of the astrophysical context of our new findings and how
non-parametric methods in gravitational-wave population inference are uniquely
poised to complement to the parametric approach as we enter the data-rich era

  Classification","IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV
  2023)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vision Transformer (ViT) has become one of the most popular neural
architectures due to its great scalability, computational efficiency, and
compelling performance in many vision tasks. However, ViT has shown inferior
performance to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on medical tasks due to its
data-hungry nature and the lack of annotated medical data. In this paper, we
pre-train ViTs on 266,340 chest X-rays using Masked Autoencoders (MAE) which
reconstruct missing pixels from a small part of each image. For comparison,
CNNs are also pre-trained on the same 266,340 X-rays using advanced
self-supervised methods (e.g., MoCo v2). The results show that our pre-trained
ViT performs comparably (sometimes better) to the state-of-the-art CNN
(DenseNet-121) for multi-label thorax disease classification. This performance
is attributed to the strong recipes extracted from our empirical studies for
pre-training and fine-tuning ViT. The pre-training recipe signifies that
medical reconstruction requires a much smaller proportion of an image (10% vs.
25%) and a more moderate random resized crop range (0.5~1.0 vs. 0.2~1.0)
compared with natural imaging. Furthermore, we remark that in-domain transfer
learning is preferred whenever possible. The fine-tuning recipe discloses that
layer-wise LR decay, RandAug magnitude, and DropPath rate are significant
factors to consider. We hope that this study can direct future research on the
application of Transformers to a larger variety of medical imaging tasks.

titanium-oxide from its terminator region. In this study, we aim to determine
whether this depletion is global by investigating the day-side emission
spectrum. We analyse 8 epochs of high-resolution spectra obtained with the
ESPRESSO spectrograph at optical wavelengths, targeting orbital phases when the
day-side is in view. We use a cross-correlation method to search for various
atoms, TiO and VO and compare to models. We constrain the velocities and
phase-function of the emission signal using a Bayesian framework. We report
significant detections of Ca I, V I, Cr I, Fe I and Ni I, but not T i or TiO.
Models containing Ti are unable to reproduce the data. The detected signals are
consistent with the known orbital and systemic velocities and with peak
emission originating from the sub-stellar point. We find that Ti is depleted
from regions of the atmosphere where transmission and emission spectroscopy are
sensitive. Supported by recent HST observations that constrain the night-side
temperature, we interpret this as evidence for the night-side condensation of
titanium, preventing it from being mixed back into the upper layers of the
atmosphere elsewhere on the planet. Species with lower condensation
temperatures are unaffected, implying sharp chemical transitions exist between
ultra-hot Jupiters that have slight differences in temperature or dynamical
properties. As TiO can act as a strong source of stratospheric heating,
cold-trapping creates a coupling between the thermal structures on the day-side
and night-side, and thus condensation chemistry needs to be included in global
circulation models. Observed elemental abundances in hot Jupiters are not
reliably representative of bulk abundances unless night-side condensation is
accounted for or the planet is hot enough to avoid night-side cold-traps
entirely.

(AIaDM) settings receive and reconcile recommendations from AI systems before

performance. First, DMs incur reconciliation costs from exerting
decision-making resources (e.g., time and effort) when reconciling AI
recommendations that contradict their own judgment. Second, DMs in AIaDM
settings exhibit algorithm discretion behavior (ADB), i.e., an idiosyncratic
tendency to imperfectly accept or reject algorithmic recommendations for any
given decision task. The human's reconciliation costs and imperfect discretion
behavior introduce the need to develop AI systems which (1) provide
recommendations selectively, (2) leverage the human partner's ADB to maximize
the team's decision accuracy while regularizing for reconciliation costs, and
(3) are inherently interpretable. We refer to the task of developing AI to
advise humans in AIaDM settings as learning to advise and we address this task
by first introducing the AI-assisted Team (AIaT)-Learning Framework. We
instantiate our framework to develop TeamRules (TR): an algorithm that produces
rule-based models and recommendations for AIaDM settings. TR is optimized to
selectively advise a human and to trade-off reconciliation costs and team
accuracy for a given environment by leveraging the human partner's ADB.
Evaluations on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets with a variety of

improves the team's objective across settings over interpretable, rule-based

First, we use an AS2 model to produce a ranking over answer candidates for a
set of questions. Then, we use the top ranked candidate as the generation
target, and the next k top ranked candidates as context for training a GenQA
model. We also propose to use the AS2 model prediction scores for loss
weighting and score-conditioned input/output shaping, to aid the knowledge
transfer. Our evaluation on three public and one large industrial datasets
demonstrates the superiority of our approach over the AS2 baseline, and GenQA

high-quality images, with generated samples often surpassing the quality of
those produced by other models under several metrics. One distinguishing
feature of these models, however, is that they typically require long sampling
chains to produce high-fidelity images. This presents a challenge not only from
the lenses of sampling time, but also from the inherent difficulty in
backpropagating through these chains in order to accomplish tasks such as model
inversion, i.e. approximately finding latent states that generate known images.
In this paper, we look at diffusion models through a different perspective,
that of a (deep) equilibrium (DEQ) fixed point model. Specifically, we extend
the recent denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM; Song et al. 2020), and
model the entire sampling chain as a joint, multivariate fixed point system.
This setup provides an elegant unification of diffusion and equilibrium models,
and shows benefits in 1) single image sampling, as it replaces the fully-serial
typical sampling process with a parallel one; and 2) model inversion, where we
can leverage fast gradients in the DEQ setting to much more quickly find the
noise that generates a given image. The approach is also orthogonal and thus
complementary to other methods used to reduce the sampling time, or improve
model inversion. We demonstrate our method's strong performance across several
datasets, including CIFAR10, CelebA, and LSUN Bedrooms and Churches.

significantly impact the performance of machine learning models resulting in
biased predictions. Numerous techniques have been proposed to address class
imbalanced problems, including, but not limited to, Oversampling,
Undersampling, and cost-sensitive approaches. Due to its ability to generate
synthetic data, oversampling techniques such as the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is among the most widely used methodology by
researchers. However, one of SMOTE's potential disadvantages is that newly
created minor samples may overlap with major samples. As an effect, the
probability of ML models' biased performance towards major classes increases.
Recently, generative adversarial network (GAN) has garnered much attention due
to its ability to create almost real samples. However, GAN is hard to train
even though it has much potential. This study proposes two novel techniques:
GAN-based Oversampling (GBO) and Support Vector Machine-SMOTE-GAN (SSG) to
overcome the limitations of the existing oversampling approaches. The
preliminary computational result shows that SSG and GBO performed better on the
expanded imbalanced eight benchmark datasets than the original SMOTE. The study
also revealed that the minor sample generated by SSG demonstrates Gaussian
distributions, which is often difficult to achieve using original SMOTE.

gravity waves in the cores of solar-type stars. We perform hydrodynamical
simulations of a previously developed Boussinesq model using a spectral-element
code to study the stellar core as a wave cavity that is periodically forced at
the outer boundary with a given azimuthal wavenumber and an adjustable
frequency. For low-amplitude forcing, the system exhibits resonances with
standing g-modes at particular frequencies, corresponding to a situation in
which the tidal torque is highly frequency-dependent. For high-amplitude
forcing, the excited waves break promptly near the centre and spin up the core
so that subsequent waves are absorbed in an expanding critical layer, as found
in previous work, leading to a tidal torque with a smooth frequency-dependence.
For intermediate-amplitude forcing, we find that linear damping of the waves
gradually spins up the core such that the resonance condition can be altered
drastically. The system can evolve towards or away from g-mode resonances,
depending on the difference between the forcing frequency and the closest
eigenfrequency. Eventually, a critical layer forms and absorbs the incoming
waves, leading to a situation similar to the high-amplitude case in which the
waves break promptly. We study the dependence of this process on the forcing
amplitude and frequency, as well as on the diffusion coefficients. We emphasize
that the small Prandtl number in the centre of solar-like stars facilitates the
development of a differentially rotating core owing to the nonlinear feedback
of waves. Our simulations and analysis reveal that this important mechanism may
drastically change the phase of gravity waves and thus the classical picture of
resonance locking in solar-type stars needs to be revised.

operating on a crypto-currency enabled token economy, where infrastructure
suppliers are rewarded with tokens for enabling, validating, managing and/or
securing the system. However, today's token economies are largely designed
without infrastructure systems in mind, and often operate with a fixed token
supply (e.g., Bitcoin). This paper argues that token economies for
infrastructure networks should be structured differently - they should
continually incentivize new suppliers to join the network to provide services
and support to the ecosystem. As such, the associated token rewards should
gracefully scale with the size of the decentralized system, but should be
carefully balanced with consumer demand to manage inflation and be designed to
ultimately reach an equilibrium. To achieve such an equilibrium, the
decentralized token economy should be adaptable and controllable so that it
maximizes the total utility of all users, such as achieving stable (overall
non-inflationary) token economies.
  Our main contribution is to model infrastructure token economies as dynamical
systems - the circulating token supply, price, and consumer demand change as a
function of the payment to nodes and costs to consumers for infrastructure
services. Crucially, this dynamical systems view enables us to leverage tools
from mathematical control theory to optimize the overall decentralized
network's performance. Moreover, our model extends easily to a Stackelberg game
between the controller and the nodes, which we use for robust, strategic
pricing. In short, we develop predictive, optimization-based controllers that
outperform traditional algorithmic stablecoin heuristics by up to $2.4 \times$
in simulations based on real demand data from existing decentralized wireless

feedback occurring in the host. Upcoming telescopes such as HUBS, with ~ 1 eV

such galaxies thus constrain these processes. In this project, we discuss X-ray
emission of the ISM and CGM of elliptical galaxies simulated using MACER code.
We generate X-ray emission data from the MACER simulations with various
feedback models and produce mock observations for an instrument with high
spectral resolution, which is a necessary step of selecting sources for the
future observations with planned mission such as HUBS. More importantly, we
establish connections between the physics of AGN and stellar feedback with the
emission spectra from the ISM and CGM to investigate the possibility of using
observations to constrain feedback models. We fit the X-ray spectra from these
simulations with standard fitting procedures and compare the retrieved physical
properties with their counterparts from the simulations to understand whether
the future high-resolution observations can reliably reveal the properties of
the gas in the galaxies.

This multi-actor-critic DDPG is then integrated with Hindsight Experience

the average value of multiple actors or critics to substitute the single actor

for solving stochastic games. In most MARL studies, agents in a game are
defined as teammates or enemies beforehand, and the relationships among the
agents remain fixed throughout the game. However, in real-world problems, the
agent relationships are commonly unknown in advance or dynamically changing.
Many multi-party interactions start off by asking: who is on my team? This
question arises whether it is the first day at the stock exchange or the
kindergarten. Therefore, training policies for such situations in the face of
imperfect information and ambiguous identities is an important problem that
needs to be addressed. In this work, we develop a novel identity detection
reinforcement learning (IDRL) framework that allows an agent to dynamically
infer the identities of nearby agents and select an appropriate policy to
accomplish the task. In the IDRL framework, a relation network is constructed
to deduce the identities of other agents by observing the behaviors of the
agents. A danger network is optimized to estimate the risk of false-positive
identifications. Beyond that, we propose an intrinsic reward that balances the
need to maximize external rewards and accurate identification. After
identifying the cooperation-competition pattern among the agents, IDRL applies
one of the off-the-shelf MARL methods to learn the policy. To evaluate the
proposed method, we conduct experiments on Red-10 card-shedding game, and the
results show that IDRL achieves superior performance over other
state-of-the-art MARL methods. Impressively, the relation network has the par
performance to identify the identities of agents with top human players; the
danger network reasonably avoids the risk of imperfect identification. The code

from language models. We consider perceptual properties to be more concrete

adjectives' concreteness score as a lever to calibrate the contribution of each

shown to successfully reproduce the large scale structure and halo abundances

few percent of full high resolution calculations. We also find that halo
artifacts, caused by spurious numerical fragmentation of filaments, are equally
present in the super-resolution outputs. Although we have not trained the
super-resolution algorithm using full quantum pressure FDM simulations, the
fact that it performs well at the relevant length and mass scales means that it
has promise as technique which could avoid the very high computational cost of
the latter, in some contexts. We conclude that AI super-resolution can become a

required to obtain the most stored energy and is accompanied by the least tight

machine learning method for obtaining solutions of partial differential
equations (PDEs). Training PINNs can be seen as a semi-supervised learning
task, in which only exact values of initial and boundary points can be obtained
in solving forward problems, and in the whole spatio-temporal domain
collocation points are sampled without exact labels, which brings training
difficulties. Thus the selection of collocation points and sampling methods are
quite crucial in training PINNs. Existing sampling methods include fixed and
dynamic types, and in the more popular latter one, sampling is usually
controlled by PDE residual loss. We point out that it is not sufficient to only
consider the residual loss in adaptive sampling and sampling should obey
temporal causality. We further introduce temporal causality into adaptive
sampling and propose a novel adaptive causal sampling method to improve the
performance and efficiency of PINNs. Numerical experiments of several PDEs with
high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearity, including Cahn Hilliard and KdV
equations, show that the proposed sampling method can improve the performance
of PINNs with few collocation points. We demonstrate that by utilizing such a
relatively simple sampling method, prediction performance can be improved up to

locations and poses (i.e. are subject to translations and rotations in 2d or
3d), but the location and pose of an object does not change its semantics (i.e.
the object's essence). That is, the specific location and rotation of an
airplane in satellite imagery, or the 3d rotation of a chair in a natural
image, or the rotation of a particle in a cryo-electron micrograph, do not
change the intrinsic nature of those objects. Here, we consider the problem of
learning semantic representations of objects that are invariant to pose and
location in a fully unsupervised manner. We address shortcomings in previous
approaches to this problem by introducing TARGET-VAE, a translation and
rotation group-equivariant variational autoencoder framework. TARGET-VAE
combines three core innovations: 1) a rotation and translation
group-equivariant encoder architecture, 2) a structurally disentangled
distribution over latent rotation, translation, and a
rotation-translation-invariant semantic object representation, which are
jointly inferred by the approximate inference network, and 3) a spatially
equivariant generator network. In comprehensive experiments, we show that
TARGET-VAE learns disentangled representations without supervision that
significantly improve upon, and avoid the pathologies of, previous methods.
When trained on images highly corrupted by rotation and translation, the
semantic representations learned by TARGET-VAE are similar to those learned on
consistently posed objects, dramatically improving clustering in the semantic
latent space. Furthermore, TARGET-VAE is able to perform remarkably accurate
unsupervised pose and location inference. We expect methods like TARGET-VAE
will underpin future approaches for unsupervised object generation, pose
prediction, and object detection.

surfactant concentration. Our numerical predictions for the temporal evolution
of the surfactant-free crown are validated against the experimental work by Che

crown dynamics evolves through various stages: from the the growth of linear
modes (through a Rayleigh- Plateau instability) to the development of
nonlinearities leading to primary and secondary breakup events (through droplet
shedding modulated by an end-pinching mechanism). We show that the addition of
surfactants does not affect the wave selection via the Rayleigh-Plateau
instability. However, the presence of surfactants plays a key role in the late
stages of the dynamics as soon as the ligaments are driven out from the rim.
Surfactant-induced Marangoni stresses delay the end-pinching mechanisms to
result in longer ligaments prior to their capillary singularity, while also
promoting the spanwise merging between ligaments. Finally, we show that the
addition of surfactants leads to surface rigidification and consequently to the
retardation of the flow dynamics.

like the control system of grouped drones, and multi-agent navigation and
obstacle avoidance which is the foundational function of advanced application
has great importance. In multi-agent navigation and obstacle avoidance tasks,
the decision-making interactions and dynamic changes of agents are difficult
for traditional route planning algorithms or reinforcement learning algorithms
with the increased complexity of the environment. The classical multi-agent
reinforcement learning algorithm, Multi-agent deep deterministic policy
gradient(MADDPG), solved precedent algorithms' problems of having unstationary
training process and unable to deal with environment randomness. However,
MADDPG ignored the temporal message hidden beneath agents' interaction with the
environment. Besides, due to its CTDE technique which let each agent's critic
network to calculate over all agents' action and the whole environment
information, it lacks ability to scale to larger amount of agents. To deal with
MADDPG's ignorance of the temporal information of the data, this article
proposes a new algorithm called MADDPG-LSTMactor, which combines MADDPG with
Long short term memory (LSTM). By using agent's observations of continuous
timesteps as the input of its policy network, it allows the LSTM layer to
process the hidden temporal message. Experimental result demonstrated that this
algorithm had better performance in scenarios where the amount of agents is
small. Besides, to solve MADDPG's drawback of not being efficient in scenarios
where agents are too many, this article puts forward a light-weight MADDPG
(MADDPG-L) algorithm, which simplifies the input of critic network. The result
of experiments showed that this algorithm had better performance than MADDPG
when the amount of agents was large.

with modern neural networks such as poor calibration and generalization, and
data inefficiency. However, scaling Bayesian inference to large architectures
is challenging and requires restrictive approximations. Monte Carlo Dropout has
been widely used as a relatively cheap way for approximate Inference and to
estimate uncertainty with deep neural networks. Traditionally, the dropout mask
is sampled independently from a fixed distribution. Recent works show that the
dropout mask can be viewed as a latent variable, which can be inferred with
variational inference. These methods face two important challenges: (a) the
posterior distribution over masks can be highly multi-modal which can be
difficult to approximate with standard variational inference and (b) it is not
trivial to fully utilize sample-dependent information and correlation among
dropout masks to improve posterior estimation. In this work, we propose
GFlowOut to address these issues. GFlowOut leverages the recently proposed
probabilistic framework of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to learn the
posterior distribution over dropout masks. We empirically demonstrate that
GFlowOut results in predictive distributions that generalize better to
out-of-distribution data, and provide uncertainty estimates which lead to
better performance in downstream tasks.

consistency for finetuning monocular room-layout models using unlabeled

pre-trained model needs to be adapted to a new data domain without using any
ground truth annotations. Our simple yet effective assumption is that multiple
layout estimations in the same scene must define a consistent geometry
regardless of their camera positions. Based on this idea, we leverage a
pre-trained model to project estimated layout boundaries from several camera
views into the 3D world coordinate. Then, we re-project them back to the
spherical coordinate and build a probability function, from which we sample the
pseudo-labels for self-training. To handle unconfident pseudo-labels, we
evaluate the variance in the re-projected boundaries as an uncertainty value to
weight each pseudo-label in our loss function during training. In addition,
since ground truth annotations are not available during training nor in
testing, we leverage the entropy information in multiple layout estimations as
a quantitative metric to measure the geometry consistency of the scene,
allowing us to evaluate any layout estimator for hyper-parameter tuning,
including model selection without ground truth annotations. Experimental
results show that our solution achieves favorable performance against

LRBench by supporting different DNN optimizers and show the significant mutual

networks are often regarded as ``black boxes'' and they are difficult to
interpret. On the other hand, sparse convolutional models, which assume that a
signal can be expressed by a linear combination of a few elements from a
convolutional dictionary, are powerful tools for analyzing natural images with
good theoretical interpretability and biological plausibility. However, such
principled models have not demonstrated competitive performance when compared
with empirically designed deep networks. This paper revisits the sparse
convolutional modeling for image classification and bridges the gap between
good empirical performance (of deep learning) and good interpretability (of
sparse convolutional models). Our method uses differentiable optimization
layers that are defined from convolutional sparse coding as drop-in
replacements of standard convolutional layers in conventional deep neural
networks. We show that such models have equally strong empirical performance on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets when compared to conventional neural
networks. By leveraging stable recovery property of sparse modeling, we further
show that such models can be much more robust to input corruptions as well as
adversarial perturbations in testing through a simple proper trade-off between
sparse regularization and data reconstruction terms. Source code can be found

common problem encountered in machine learning applications. One approach to
resolve this issue is to use the Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) technique
that carries out knowledge transfer from a label-rich source domain to an
unlabeled target domain. Outliers that exist in either source or target
datasets can introduce additional challenges when using UDA in practice. In
this paper, $\alpha$-divergence is used as a measure to minimize the
discrepancy between the source and target distributions while inheriting
robustness, adjustable with a single parameter $\alpha$, as the prominent
feature of this measure. Here, it is shown that the other well-known
divergence-based UDA techniques can be derived as special cases of the proposed
method. Furthermore, a theoretical upper bound is derived for the loss in the
target domain in terms of the source loss and the initial $\alpha$-divergence
between the two domains. The robustness of the proposed method is validated
through testing on several benchmarked datasets in open-set and partial UDA
setups where extra classes existing in target and source datasets are
considered as outliers.

information on particle acceleration mechanisms during the impulsive phase of
solar flares. We searched using the Super-Kamiokande detector for neutrinos
from solar flares that occurred during solar cycles $23$ and $24$, including
the largest solar flare (X28.0) on November 4th, 2003. In order to minimize the
background rate we searched for neutrino interactions within narrow time
windows coincident with $\gamma$-rays and soft X-rays recorded by satellites.
In addition, we performed the first attempt to search for solar-flare neutrinos
from solar flares on the invisible side of the Sun by using the emission time
of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). By selecting twenty powerful solar flares
above X5.0 on the visible side and eight CMEs whose emission speed exceeds
$2000$ $\mathrm{km \, s^{-1}}$ on the invisible side from 1996 to 2018, we
found two (six) neutrino events coincident with solar flares occurring on the
visible (invisible) side of the Sun, with a typical background rate of $0.10$
($0.62$) events per flare in the MeV-GeV energy range. No significant
solar-flare neutrino signal above the estimated background rate was observed.
As a result we set the following upper limit on neutrino fluence at the Earth
$\mathit{\Phi}<1.1\times10^{6}$ $\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ at the $90\%$ confidence
level for the largest solar flare. The resulting fluence limits allow us to
constrain some of the theoretical models for solar-flare neutrino emission.

information from documents in biomedical applications. A notable advantage of
NER is its consistency in extracting biomedical entities in a document context.
Although existing document NER models show consistent predictions, they still
do not meet our expectations. We investigated whether the adjectives and
prepositions within an entity cause a low label consistency, which results in
inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we present our method, ConNER, which
enhances the label dependency of modifiers (e.g., adjectives and prepositions)
to achieve higher label agreement. ConNER refines the draft labels of the
modifiers to improve the output representations of biomedical entities. The
effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on four popular biomedical NER
datasets; in particular, its efficacy is proved on two datasets with 7.5-8.6%
absolute improvements in the F1 score. We interpret that our ConNER method is
effective on datasets that have intrinsically low label consistency. In the
qualitative analysis, we demonstrate how our approach makes the NER model
generate consistent predictions. Our code and resources are available at

nearly a decade ago, research on adversarial machine learning has rapidly
evolved into an eternal war between defenders, who seek to increase the
robustness of ML models against adversarial attacks, and adversaries, who seek
to develop better attacks capable of weakening or defeating these defenses.
This domain, however, has found little buy-in from ML practitioners, who are
neither overtly concerned about these attacks affecting their systems in the
real world nor are willing to trade off the accuracy of their models in pursuit
of robustness against these attacks.
  In this paper, we motivate the design and implementation of Ares, an
evaluation framework for adversarial ML that allows researchers to explore
attacks and defenses in a realistic wargame-like environment. Ares frames the
conflict between the attacker and defender as two agents in a reinforcement
learning environment with opposing objectives. This allows the introduction of
system-level evaluation metrics such as time to failure and evaluation of
complex strategies such as moving target defenses. We provide the results of
our initial exploration involving a white-box attacker against an adversarially

we design a new authenticated ordered multicast primitive (AOM) that provides
transferable authentication and non-equivocation guarantees. Feasibility of the
design is demonstrated by two hardware implementations of AOM -- one using HMAC
and the other using public key cryptography for authentication -- on
new-generation programmable switches. We then co-design a new BFT protocol,
Matrix, that leverages the guarantees of AOM to eliminate cross-replica
coordination and authentication in the common case. Evaluation results show
that Matrix outperforms state-of-the-art protocols on both latency and

the surface Brillouin zone that connect the projected Weyl nodes of opposite
chirality. The unclosed FAs can give rise to various exotic effects that have
attracted tremendous research interest. The configurations of the FAs are
usually thought to be determined fully by the band topology of the bulk states,
which seems impossible to manipulate. Here, we show that the FAs can be simply
modified by a surface gate voltage. Because the penetration length of the
surface states depends on the in-plane momentum, a surface gate voltage induces
an effective energy dispersion. As a result, a continuous deformation of the
surface band can be implemented by tuning the surface gate voltage. In
particular, as the saddle point of the surface band meets the Fermi energy, the
topological Lifshitz transition takes place for the FAs, during which the Weyl
nodes switch their partners connected by the FAs. Accordingly, the magnetic
Weyl orbits composed of the FAs on opposite surfaces and chiral Landau bands
inside the bulk change its configurations. We show that such an effect can be
probed by the nonlocal transport measurements in a magnetic field, in which the
switch on and off of the nonlocal conductance by the surface gate voltage
signals the Lifshitz transition. Our work opens a new route for manipulating
the FAs by surface gates and exploring novel transport phenomena associated

neurobiological processes, such as cognition, requires substantially more
related evidences, especially from in-vivo human experiments. Cognition and
language are of inter-disciplinary nature and additional methodological support
is needed from other disciplines, such as deep learning in the field of
artificial intelligence, for example. In this paper, we have attempted to
explain the neural mechanisms underlying ""cognition and language processing"" or
""cognition or thinking"" using a novel neural network model with several newly
emerging developments such as neuronal resonance, in-vivo human fiber
tractography or connectivity data, Engram and Hebbian hypothesis, human memory
formation in the high brain areas, deep learning, and more recently developed
neural memory concepts, the neural lexicon. The neural lexicon is developed via
language by repeated exposure to the neural system, similar to multilayer
signal processing in deep learning. We have derived a neural model to explain
how human ""cognition and language processing"" or ""cognition and thinking""
works, with a focus on language, a universal medium of the human society.
Although the proposed hypothesis is not fully based on experimental evidences,
a substantial portion of the observations in this study is directly and
indirectly supported by recent experimental findings and the theoretical bases
of deep learning research.

these nascent developments have raised a number of questions. Thus, we
demonstrate the ability of equipoise estimators (overlap, matching, and entropy

estimators have been shown to be flexible and easy to interpret. However,
promoting their wide use requires that researchers know clearly why, when to

treatment effect. We zero into the typical pitfalls of the IPW estimator and
its relationship with the estimators of the average treatment effect on the
treated (ATT) and on the controls (ATC). Furthermore, we also compare IPW

What fundamentally distinguishes their estimands? When should we expect similar

wireframe to an end-to-end trainable holistic attraction field that has
built-in geometry-awareness, context-awareness and robustness. The proposed
HAWP consists of three components: generating line segment and end-point
proposal, binding line segment and end-point, and end-point-decoupled
lines-of-interest verification. For self-supervised learning, a
simulation-to-reality pipeline is exploited in which a HAWP is first trained
using synthetic data and then used to ``annotate"" wireframes in real images
with Homographic Adaptation. With the self-supervised annotations, a HAWP model
for real images is trained from scratch. In experiments, the proposed HAWP
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both the Wireframe dataset and the

the phenomenon of neuron disturbing, where neurons from heterogeneous local

Bayesian viewpoint combining the data heterogeneity among clients and
properties of neural networks. Furthermore, to validate our findings, we
propose an experimental method that excludes neuron disturbing and fuses neural
networks via adaptively selecting a local model, called AMS, to execute the

This implies the necessity of considering neural disturbing in model fusion.

moment in the video, video grounding aims to localize the time interval by
understanding the text and video simultaneously. One of the most challenging
issues is an extremely time- and cost-consuming annotation collection,
including video captions in a natural language form and their corresponding
temporal regions. In this paper, we present a simple yet novel training
framework for video grounding in the zero-shot setting, which learns a network
with only video data without any annotation. Inspired by the recent
language-free paradigm, i.e. training without language data, we train the
network without compelling the generation of fake (pseudo) text queries into a
natural language form. Specifically, we propose a method for learning a video
grounding model by selecting a temporal interval as a hypothetical correct
answer and considering the visual feature selected by our method in the
interval as a language feature, with the help of the well-aligned
visual-language space of CLIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate the prominence
of our language-free training framework, outperforming the existing zero-shot

applications such as wound healing, cancer metastasis, and embryonic

in a crawling kind of locomotion. Despite existing computational models of
amoeboid motion, the inference of expansion and retraction components of
individual cells, the corresponding classification of cells, and the a priori
specification of the parameter regime to achieve a specific motility behavior
remain challenging open problems. We propose a novel model of the
spatio-temporal evolution of two-dimensional cell contours comprising three
biophysiologically motivated components: a stochastic term accounting for
membrane protrusions and two deterministic terms accounting for membrane
retractions by regularizing the shape and area of the contour. Mathematically,
these correspond to the intensity of a self-exciting Poisson point process, the
area-preserving curve-shortening flow, and an area adjustment flow. The model
is used to generate contour data for a variety of qualitatively different,
e.g., polarized and non-polarized, cell tracks that are hardly distinguishable
from experimental data. In application to experimental cell tracks, we inferred
the protrusion component and examined its correlation to commonly used
biomarkers: the actin concentration close to the membrane and its local motion.
Due to the low model complexity, parameter estimation is fast, straightforward
and offers a simple way to classify contour dynamics based on two locomotion
types: the amoeboid and a so-called fan-shaped type. For both types, we use
cell tracks segmented from fluorescence imaging data of the model organism D.

Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy have been proposed to possibly reside at the
intersection region of the X1 and X2 orbits for several reasons. This includes
the detection of co-spatial low- and high-velocity clouds, high velocity
dispersion, high fractional molecular abundances of shock-tracing molecules,
and kinetic temperatures that are higher than for usual CMZ clouds. We mapped
both cloud complexes in molecular lines in the frequency range from 85 to
475GHz with the IRAM 30m and the APEX 12m telescopes. The kinematic structure
of G1.3 reveals an `emission bridge' at intermediate velocities (~150km/s)
connecting low-velocity (~100km/s) and high-velocity (~180km/s) gas and an
overall fluffy shell-like structure. These may represent observational evidence
of cloud-cloud interactions. Low- and high-velocity gas components in G1.6 do
not show such evidence of interaction, suggesting that they are spatially
separated. We selected three positions in each cloud complex for further
analysis. Based on non-LTE modelling of an ensemble of CH3CN lines, we derived
kinetic temperatures of 60-100K and H2 volume densities of 10$^4$-10$^5$cm-3 in
both complexes. Molecular abundances relative to H2 suggest a similar chemistry
of the two clouds, which is moreover similar to that of other GC clouds. We
conclude that G1.3 may indeed exhibit signs of cloud-cloud interactions. We
propose an interaction of gas that is accreted from the near-side dust lane to
the CMZ, with gas pre-existing at this location. Low- and high-velocity
components in G1.6 are rather coincidentally observed along the same line of
sight. They may be associated with either overshot decelerated gas from the
far-side dust line or actual CMZ gas and high-velocity gas moving on a dust
lane. These scenarios would be in agreement with numerical simulations.

However, established object detectors require complete, precise, and correct

training annotations for object detectors, imagery can be georeferenced and
combined with data from other sources, such as points of interest localized by
GPS sensors. Unfortunately, this combination often leads to poor object
localization and missing annotations. Therefore, training object detectors with
such data often results in insufficient detection performance. In this paper,
we present a novel approach for training object detectors with extremely noisy

framework and a correction module accounting for imprecise and missing

cancer, autoimmune diseases, and allergies. Effectively designing such vaccines
requires accurate prediction of proteasomal cleavage in order to ensure that

histocompatibility complex (MHC). While direct identification of proteasomal
cleavage \emph{in vitro} is cumbersome and low throughput, it is possible to
implicitly infer cleavage events from the termini of MHC-presented epitopes,
which can be detected in large amounts thanks to recent advances in
high-throughput MHC ligandomics. Inferring cleavage events in such a way
provides an inherently noisy signal which can be tackled with new developments
in the field of deep learning that supposedly make it possible to learn
predictors from noisy labels. Inspired by such innovations, we sought to
modernize proteasomal cleavage predictors by benchmarking a wide range of
recent methods, including LSTMs, transformers, CNNs, and denoising methods, on
a recently introduced cleavage dataset. We found that increasing model scale
and complexity appeared to deliver limited performance gains, as several
methods reached about 88.5% AUC on C-terminal and 79.5% AUC on N-terminal
cleavage prediction. This suggests that the noise and/or complexity of
proteasomal cleavage and the subsequent biological processes of the antigen
processing pathway are the major limiting factors for predictive performance
rather than the specific modeling approach used. While biological complexity
can be tackled by more data and better models, noise and randomness inherently
limit the maximum achievable predictive performance. All our datasets and

limit of the Navier-Stokes-Maxwell equations with Cattaneo's law near a
bounding flat line, when the Hartmann, Reynolds and magnetic Reynolds numbers
proportionally diverge to infinity. The goal of this paper is twofold. We first
show that the extended version of the Navier-Stokes-Maxwell equations leads to
a new family of boundary layers, which are hyperbolic both on the momentum
equation and the Ampere's law. Secondly, we address the well-posedness of the
derived equations and show the existence of global-in-time analytic solutions
for small initial data. Our modelling highlights which conditions on the
dimensionless parameters allow to interpret the proposed system as boundary
layers with thickness typical of Prandtl or Hartmann. Furthermore, our
development shows that the conditions related to Hartmann might be more
physically acceptable. Finally, our analysis suggests that the Cattaneo's law
and the displacement current might indeed stabilise the derived system in terms
of existence of global-in-time analytic solutions.

covered simultaneously. We consider black hole binaries with total masses
ranging from $10\rm M_\odot\sim10^7 M_\odot$ and ppE corrections at
post-Newtonian (PN) orders ranging from $-4$PN to $2$PN. Compared to the
current ground-based detectors, TianQin can improve the constraints on the ppE
phase parameter $\beta$ by orders of magnitude. For example, the improvement at
the $-4$PN and $2$PN orders can be about $13$ and $3$ orders of magnitude
(compared to the results from GW150914), respectively. Compared to future
ground-based detectors, such as ET, TianQin is expected to be superior below
the $-1$PN order, and for corrections above the $-0.5$PN order, TianQin is
still competitive near the large mass end of the low mass range $[10 \rm
M_\odot, \,10^3 \rm M_\odot]\,$. Compared to the future space-based detector
LISA, TianQin can be competitive in the lower mass end as the PN order is

sources more massive than about $30\rm M_\odot\,$, while at the $2$PN order,
TianQin becomes competitive for sources less massive than about $10^4\rm

considers a Team-to-Team Multi-vehicle Pursuit (T2TMVP) problem in the
complicated urban traffic scene where the evading vehicles adopt the
pre-trained dynamic strategies to execute decisions intelligently. To solve
this problem, we propose an opponent-aware reinforcement learning via
maximizing mutual information indicator (OARLM2I2) method to improve pursuit
efficiency in the complicated environment. First, a sequential encoding-based
opponents joint strategy modeling (SEOJSM) mechanism is proposed to generate
evading vehicles' joint strategy model, which assists the multi-agent
decision-making process based on deep Q-network (DQN). Then, we design a mutual
information-united loss, simultaneously considering the reward fed back from
the environment and the effectiveness of opponents' joint strategy model, to
update pursuing vehicles' decision-making process. Extensive experiments based
on SUMO demonstrate our method outperforms other baselines by 21.48% on average
in reducing pursuit time. The code is available at

stochastic optimal control problem under incomplete information and memory
limitation. In order to obtain the optimal control function of ML-POSC, a
system of the forward Fokker-Planck (FP) equation and the backward
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation needs to be solved. In this work, we
firstly show that the system of HJB-FP equations can be interpreted via the
Pontryagin's minimum principle on the probability density function space. Based
on this interpretation, we then propose the forward-backward sweep method
(FBSM) to ML-POSC, which has been used in the Pontryagin's minimum principle.
FBSM is an algorithm to compute the forward FP equation and the backward HJB
equation alternately. Although the convergence of FBSM is generally not
guaranteed, it is guaranteed in ML-POSC because the coupling of HJB-FP
equations is limited to the optimal control function in ML-POSC.

Geometry algorithms and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for image-based 3D

representations, mainly due to a differentiable volumetric rendering
formulation that enables high-quality and geometry-aware novel view synthesis.
However, the underlying geometry of the scene is not explicitly constrained
during training, thus leading to noisy and incorrect results when extracting a
mesh with marching cubes. To this end, we propose to leverage pixelwise depths
and normals from a classical 3D reconstruction pipeline as geometric priors to
guide NeRF optimization. Such priors are used as pseudo-ground truth during
training in order to improve the quality of the estimated underlying surface.
Moreover, each pixel is weighted by a confidence value based on the
forward-backward reprojection error for additional robustness. Experimental
results on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in
obtaining clean 3D meshes from images, while maintaining competitive
performances in novel view synthesis.

underperform on subgroups of the data. We consider the tabular setting, which
surfaces the unique issue of outcome heterogeneity - this is prevalent in areas
such as healthcare, where patients with similar features can have different
outcomes, thus making reliable predictions challenging. To tackle this, we
propose Data-IQ, a framework to systematically stratify examples into subgroups
with respect to their outcomes. We do this by analyzing the behavior of
individual examples during training, based on their predictive confidence and,
importantly, the aleatoric (data) uncertainty. Capturing the aleatoric
uncertainty permits a principled characterization and then subsequent
stratification of data examples into three distinct subgroups (Easy, Ambiguous,
Hard). We experimentally demonstrate the benefits of Data-IQ on four real-world
medical datasets. We show that Data-IQ's characterization of examples is most
robust to variation across similarly performant (yet different) models,
compared to baselines. Since Data-IQ can be used with any ML model (including
neural networks, gradient boosting etc.), this property ensures consistency of
data characterization, while allowing flexible model selection. Taking this a
step further, we demonstrate that the subgroups enable us to construct new
approaches to both feature acquisition and dataset selection. Furthermore, we
highlight how the subgroups can inform reliable model usage, noting the
significant impact of the Ambiguous subgroup on model generalization.

marginal, and that, if the difference in the best-fit values of $\Delta

specific pad topology is required to enable the connection via conductive

of users in the same time-frequency resource element, and this feature can be
leveraged to carry additional information. In the orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) system, we propose a novel enhanced NOMA scheme, called
NOMA with informative envelope (NOMA-IE), to explore the flexibility of the
envelope of NOMA signals. In this scheme, data bits are conveyed by the
quantified signal envelope in addition to classic signal constellations. The
subcarrier activation patterns of different users are jointly decided by the
envelope former. At the receiver, successive interference cancellation (SIC) is
employed, and we also introduce the envelope detection coefficient to eliminate
the error floor. Theoretical expressions of spectral efficiency and energy
efficiency are provided for the NOMA-IE. Then, considering the binary phase
shift keying modulation, we derive the asymptotic bit error rate for the
two-subcarrier OFDM subblock. Afterwards, the expressions are extended to the
four-subcarrier case. The analytical results reveal that the imperfect SIC and
the index error are the main factors degrading the error performance. The
numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the NOMA-IE over the OFDM and
OFDM-NOMA, especially in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.

synchronous ''rendez-vous'' communications to fully asynchronous/out-of-order
communications. For large-scale distributed systems, the communication model is
determined by the transport layer of the network, and a few classes of orders
of message delivery (FIFO, causally ordered) have been identified in the early
days of distributed computing. For local-scale message-passing applications,
e.g., running on a single machine, the communication model may be determined by
the actual implementation of message buffers and by how FIFO queues are used.
While large-scale communication models, such as causal ordering, are defined by
logical axioms, local-scale models are often defined by an operational
semantics. In this work, we connect these two approaches, and we present a
unified hierarchy of communication models encompassing both large-scale and
local-scale models, based on their concurrent behaviors. We also show that all
the communication models we consider can be axiomatized in the monadic second

inputs has recently benefited from cooperative game theory concepts.By using
this theory, despite the potential correlation between the inputs, meaningful
sensitivity indices can be defined via allocation shares of the model output's
variance to each input. The ``Shapley effects'', i.e., the Shapley values
transposed to variance-based GSA problems, allowed for this suitable solution.
However, these indices exhibit a particular behavior that can be undesirable:
an exogenous input (i.e., which is not explicitly included in the structural
equations of the model) can be associated with a strictly positive index when
it is correlated to endogenous inputs. In the present work, the use of a
different allocation, called the ``proportional values'' is investigated. A
first contribution is to propose an extension of this allocation, suitable for
variance-based GSA. Novel GSA indices are then proposed, called the
``proportional marginal effects'' (PME). The notion of exogeneity is formally
defined in the context of variance-based GSA, and it is shown that the PME
allow the distinction of exogenous variables, even when they are correlated to
endogenous inputs. Moreover, their behavior is compared to the Shapley effects
on analytical toy-cases and more realistic use-cases.

programming that targets the same audience. A first difference compared to
other existing introductions to SDP is that this work comes out of a mind that
was itself struggling to understand. This may seem to be only a weakness, but,
paradoxically, it is both a weakness and a strength. First, I did not try to
overpower the reader, but I tried to minimize the distance between the author
and the reader as much as possible, even hoping to achieve a small level of
mutual empathy. This enabled me avoid a quite common pitfall: many
long-acknowledged experts tend to forget the difficulties of beginners. Other
experts try to make all proofs as short as possible and to dismiss as
unimportant certain key results they have seen thousands of time in their
career. I also avoided this, even if I did shorten a few proofs when I revised
this manuscript two years after it was first written. However, I also kept
certain proofs that seem longer than necessary because I feel they offer more
insight; an important goal is to capture the ""spirit"" of each proven result
instead of reducing it to a flow of formulae.
  The very first key step towards mastering SDP programming is to get full
insight into the eigen-decomposition of real symmetric matrices. It is enough
to see the way many other introductions to SDP programming address this
eigen-decomposition to understand that their target audience is different from
mine. They often list the eigen-decomposition without proof, while I give two
proofs to really familiarize the reader with it.

energy cosmic rays have been conducted in the last decade based on the
molecular Bremsstrahlung radiation (MBR) at GHz frequencies from quasi-elastic
collisions of ionisation electrons left in the atmosphere after the passage of
the cascade of particles. These attempts have led to the detection of a handful
of signals only, all of them forward-directed along the shower axis and hence
suggestive of originating from geomagnetic and Askaryan emissions extending
into GHz frequencies close to the Cherenkov angle. In this contribution to
ARENA2022, the lack of detection of events is explained by the coherent
suppression of the MBR in frequency ranges below the collision rate due to the
destructive interference impacting the emission amplitude of photons between
the successive collisions of the electrons. The spectral intensity at the
ground level is shown to be several orders of magnitude below the sensitivity
of experimental setups. Consequently the MBR cannot be seen as the basis of a
new detection technique of EAS for the next decades. The formalism developed to
get at this conclusion allowed the key role of the two-point correlation
function of the ionisation electron velocities to be highlighted. This can
serve to study the intensity of the re-radiation of these ionization electrons
subject to the passage of an incoming coherent wave from a radar transmitter.
Some hints on this will be presented.

reinforcement learning, there is no well-established standard selection of

widespread understanding of the rich theory of hardness of environments. The
goal of this paper is to unlock the practical usefulness of this theory through
four main contributions. First, we present a systematic survey of the theory of
hardness, which also identifies promising research directions. Second, we
introduce Colosseum, a pioneering package that enables empirical hardness
analysis and implements a principled benchmark composed of environments that
are diverse with respect to different measures of hardness. Third, we present
an empirical analysis that provides new insights into computable measures.
Finally, we benchmark five tabular agents in our newly proposed benchmark.
While advancing the theoretical understanding of hardness in non-tabular
reinforcement learning remains essential, our contributions in the tabular
setting are intended as solid steps towards a principled non-tabular benchmark.
Accordingly, we benchmark four agents in non-tabular versions of Colosseum

address the problems, we propose a unified model for REG and REC, named UniRef.
It unifies these two tasks with the carefully-designed Image-Region-Text Fusion

cross-attention and region cross-attention. Additionally, IRTF could generate
pseudo input regions for the REC task to enable a uniform way for sharing the

  Synthesis","Accepted at BMVC 2022 - 21 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Novel-view synthesis (NVS) can be tackled through different approaches,
depending on the general setting: a single source image to a short video
sequence, exact or noisy camera pose information, 3D-based information such as
point clouds etc. The most challenging scenario, the one where we stand in this
work, only considers a unique source image to generate a novel one from another
viewpoint. However, in such a tricky situation, the latest learning-based
solutions often struggle to integrate the camera viewpoint transformation.
Indeed, the extrinsic information is often passed as-is, through a
low-dimensional vector. It might even occur that such a camera pose, when
parametrized as Euler angles, is quantized through a one-hot representation.
This vanilla encoding choice prevents the learnt architecture from inferring
novel views on a continuous basis (from a camera pose perspective). We claim it
exists an elegant way to better encode relative camera pose, by leveraging
3D-related concepts such as the epipolar constraint. We, therefore, introduce
an innovative method that encodes the viewpoint transformation as a 2D feature
image. Such a camera encoding strategy gives meaningful insights to the network
regarding how the camera has moved in space between the two views. By encoding
the camera pose information as a finite number of coloured epipolar lines, we
demonstrate through our experiments that our strategy outperforms vanilla
encoding.

disentangles good performance achieved by mere compression of the training

representations with certain spectral properties (called HLS) may be more
effective for the exploration-exploitation task, enabling LinUCB to achieve

BanditSRL, a representation learning algorithm that combines a novel
constrained optimization problem to learn a realizable representation with good
spectral properties with a generalized likelihood ratio test to exploit the
recovered representation and avoid excessive exploration. We prove that
BanditSRL can be paired with any no-regret algorithm and achieve constant
regret whenever an HLS representation is available. Furthermore, BanditSRL can
be easily combined with deep neural networks and we show how regularizing
towards HLS representations is beneficial in standard benchmarks.

lattice structures made of ductile pure copper (Cu). For the first time, Cu
lattice structures are fabricated through laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) with
green laser ({\lambda} = 515 nm). Structural and microstructural analysis
confirm that the lattice structures consist of well-defined unit cells and show
dense microstructure. The deformation behavior is investigated under a wide
range of strain rates from ~0.001 /s to ~1000 /s. The stress-strain curves
exhibit a smooth and continuous deformation without any post-yield softening,
which can be attributed to the intrinsic mechanical properties of Cu.
Correlated with post-mortem microscopy examination, the rate-dependent
deformation behavior of pure Cu lattice structures is investigated and
rationalized. The current work suggests that the complex Cu architectures can
be fabricated by L-PBF with green laser and the lattice structures made of

observed at 2.06 au from the Sun (phase angle of 28.5 deg) about two weeks
before perihelion. T2 lacks a significant dust tail in scattered light, showing
a strong central condensation of the coma throughout the apparition,
reminiscent of so-called Manx comets. Its spectral slope of polarized light
increases and decreases in the J (1.25 um) and H (1.65 um) bands, respectively,
resulting in an overall negative (blue) slope (-0.31+/-0.14 % um^-1) in
contrast to the red polarimetric color of active comets observed at similar
geometries. The average polarization degree of T2 is 2.86+/-0.17 % for the J
and 2.75+/-0.16 % for the H bands. Given that near-infrared wavelengths are
sensitive to the intermediate-scale structure of cometary dust (i.e., dust
aggregates), our light-scattering modeling of ballistic aggregates with
different porosities and compositions shows that polarimetric properties of T2
are compatible with low-porosity (~66 %), absorbing dust aggregates with
negligible ice contents on a scale of 10--100 um (density of ~652 kg m^-3).
This is supported by the coma morphology of T2 which has a viable beta (the
relative importance of solar radiation pressure on dust) range of <~10^-4.
Secular evolution of the r-band activity of T2 from archival data reveals that
the increase in its brightness accelerates around 2.4 au pre-perihelion, with
its overall dust production rate ~100 times smaller than those of active

owing to their simplicity and potential applications expected in genomics,
sensing, archival information storage, and computing. The underlying sensing
technique of nanopore technology is the analysis of modulations in the ionic
current while molecules are electrophoretically driven through the nanopore.
This current blockade-based sensing is presently well recognized and
commercially used for applications such as DNA sequencing. However, this ionic
currentbased method has limitations and increased complexity for futuristic
applications such as single molecular protein sequencing, where diverse charges
and shape distributions are involved. A high throughput readout method that can
be used in extreme environments and has improved sensitivity to the mixed
charge profiles and shape of the analytes is required. In this work, we present
an exploratory finite element simulation study on the feasibility of using
electric-field modulations instead of ionic current blockades for nanopore
translocation measurements. This electric field sensing technique has further
advantages over ionic current blockade measurements. For instance, Electric
field sensing is capable of size and charge discretion with lesser noise and
does not mandate the presence of an electrolyte solution. This technique can be
used in extreme environments and developed for defense and space applications
such as detecting air-born particles and future mars, moon, and Europa
missions. We hope this work will be a starting point for developing electric
field sensing for nanopore applications and opening the field of nanopore
electrometry.

Assembly Model (SFTAM), where 2D tiles are placed on host 3D surfaces made of
axis-parallel unit cubes glued together by their faces, called polycubes. The
bonds are flexible, so that the assembly can bind on the edges of the polycube.
We are interested in the study of SFTAM self-assemblies on 3D surfaces which
are not always embeddable in the Euclidean plane, in order to compare their
different behaviors and to compute the topological properties of the host
surfaces.
  We focus on a family of polycubes called cuboids. Order-0 cuboids are
polycubes that have six rectangular faces, and order-1 cuboids are made from
two order-0 cuboids by substracting one from the other. Thus, order-1 cuboids
can be of genus 0 or of genus 1 (then they contain a tunnel). We are interested
in the genus of these structures, and we present a SFTAM tile assembly system
that determines the genus of a given order-1 cuboid. The SFTAM tile assembly
system which we design, contains a specific set $Y$ of tile types with the
following properties. If the assembly is made on a host order-1 cuboid $C$ of
genus 0, no tile of $Y$ appears in any producible assembly, but if $C$ has
genus 1, every terminal assembly contains at least one tile of $Y$.
  Thus, we are able to distinguish the host surfaces according to their genus,
by the tiles used in the assembly. This system is specific to order-1 cuboids
but the techniques we use should be generalizable to other families of shapes.

emission line with the methods of interferometry in order to examine the
kinematics of the hydrogen gas emission region in the inner accretion disk of a
sample of solar-like young stellar objects. The goal is to identify trends and
categories among the sources of our sample and to discuss whether or not they
can be tied to different origin mechanisms associated with Br-gamma emission in
T Tauri stars, chiefly and most prominently magnetospheric accretion.
  Methods: We observed a sample of seven T Tauri stars for the first time with
VLTI GRAVITY, recording spectra and spectrally dispersed interferometric
quantities across the Br-gamma line in the NIR K-band. We use them to extract
the size of the Br-gamma emission region and the photocenter shifts. To assist
in the interpretation, we also make use of radiative transfer models of
magnetospheric accretion to establish a baseline of expected interferometric
signatures if accretion is the primary driver of Br-gamma emission.
  Results: From among our sample, we find that five of the seven T~Tauri stars
show an emission region with a half-flux radius in the range broadly expected
for magnetospheric truncation. Two of the five objects also show Br-gamma
emission primarily originating from within the corotation radius, while two
other objects exhibit extended emission on a scale beyond 10 R$_*$, one of them
even beyond the K~band continuum half-flux radius of 11.3 R$_*$.
  Conclusions: We find strong evidence to suggest that for the two weakest
accretors in the sample, magnetospheric accretion is the primary driver of
Br-gamma radiation. The results for the remaining sources imply either partial
or strong contributions coming from spatially extended emission components in
the form of outflows, such as stellar or disk winds.

distinct keys into the address space $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ bijectively. It is
well-known that $n\log_2(e)$ bits are necessary to specify a minimal perfect
hash function (MPHF) $f$, when no additional knowledge of the input keys is to
be used. However, it is often the case in practice that the input keys have
intrinsic relationships that we can exploit to lower the bit complexity of $f$.
For example, consider a string and the set of all its distinct $k$-mers as
input keys: since two consecutive $k$-mers share an overlap of $k-1$ symbols,
it seems possible to beat the classic $\log_2(e)$ bits/key barrier in this
case. Moreover, we would like $f$ to map consecutive $k$-mers to consecutive
addresses, as to also preserve as much as possible their relationship in the
codomain. This is a useful feature in practice as it guarantees a certain
degree of locality of reference for $f$, resulting in a better evaluation time
when querying consecutive $k$-mers. Motivated by these premises, we initiate
the study of a new type of locality-preserving MPHF designed for $k$-mers
extracted consecutively from a collection of strings. We design a construction
whose space usage decreases for growing $k$ and discuss experiments with a
practical implementation of the method: in practice, the functions built with
our method can be several times smaller and even faster to query than the most
efficient MPHFs in the literature.

essential for electron microscopy analysis. Despite the outstanding performance
of fully supervised methods, they highly rely on sufficient per-pixel annotated
data and are sensitive to domain shift. Aiming to develop a highly
annotation-efficient approach with competitive performance, we focus on
weakly-supervised domain adaptation (WDA) with a type of extremely sparse and
weak annotation demanding minimal annotation efforts, i.e., sparse point
annotations on only a small subset of object instances. To reduce performance
degradation arising from domain shift, we explore multi-level transferable
knowledge through conducting three complementary tasks, i.e., counting,
detection, and segmentation, constituting a task pyramid with different levels
of domain invariance. The intuition behind this is that after investigating a
related source domain, it is much easier to spot similar objects in the target
domain than to delineate their fine boundaries. Specifically, we enforce
counting estimation as a global constraint to the detection with sparse
supervision, which further guides the segmentation. A cross-position
cut-and-paste augmentation is introduced to further compensate for the
annotation sparsity. Extensive validations show that our model with only 15%

to solve resource management, interference management, autonomy, and

approaches require collecting data at a central server for training, which
cannot preserve the data privacy of devices. To address this issue, federated
learning (FL) is an effective method to allow edge devices to collaboratively
train ML models without sharing local datasets for data privacy. Typically, FL
focuses on learning a global model for a given task and all devices and hence
cannot adapt the model to devices with different data distributions. In such
cases, meta learning can be employed to adapt learning models to different data
distributions using a few data samples. In this tutorial, we conduct a
comprehensive review on FL, meta learning, and federated meta learning
(FedMeta). Compared to other tutorial papers, our objective is to leverage how
FL/meta-learning/FedMeta can be designed, optimized, and evolved over
non-wireless and wireless networks. Furthermore, we analyze not only the
relationship among these learning algorithms but also their advantages and
disadvantages in real-world applications.

actions that is grounded in the cognitive framework of active inference. The
model assumes that to solve a joint task, such as pressing together a red or
blue button, two (or more) agents engage in a process of interactive inference.
Each agent maintains probabilistic beliefs about the goal of the joint task
(e.g., should we press the red or blue button?) and updates them by observing
the other agent's movements, while in turn selecting movements that make his
own intentions legible and easy to infer by the other agent (i.e., sensorimotor
communication). Over time, the interactive inference aligns both the beliefs
and the behavioral strategies of the agents, hence ensuring the success of the
joint action. We exemplify the functioning of the model in two simulations. The
first simulation illustrates a ''leaderless'' joint action. It shows that when
two agents lack a strong preference about their joint task goal, they jointly
infer it by observing each other's movements. In turn, this helps the
interactive alignment of their beliefs and behavioral strategies. The second
simulation illustrates a ""leader-follower"" joint action. It shows that when one
agent (""leader"") knows the true joint goal, it uses sensorimotor communication
to help the other agent (""follower"") infer it, even if doing this requires
selecting a more costly individual plan. These simulations illustrate that
interactive inference supports successful multi-agent joint actions and
reproduces key cognitive and behavioral dynamics of ""leaderless"" and
""leader-follower"" joint actions observed in human-human experiments. In sum,
interactive inference provides a cognitively inspired, formal framework to
realize cooperative joint actions and consensus in multi-agent systems.

years, and asymptomatic infections have exacerbated the spread of the epidemic.
To evaluate the role of asymptomatic infections in the spread of the epidemic,
we develop mathematical models to assess the proportion of asymptomatic
infections caused by different strains of the main covid-19 variants. The
analysis shows that when the control reproduction number is less than 1, the
disease-free equilibrium point of the model is globally asymptotically stable;
and when the control reproduction number is greater than 1, the endemic
equilibrium point exists and is unique, and is locally asymptotically stable.
We fit the epidemic data in the four time periods corresponding to the selected
614G, Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants. The fitting results show that, from
the comparison of the four time periods, the proportion of asymptomatic persons
among the infected persons gradually increased. We also predict the peak time
and peak value for the four time periods, and the results indicate that the
transmission speed and transmission intensity of the variant strains increased
to some extent. Finally, we discuss the impact of the detection ratio of
symptomatic infections on the spread of the epidemic. The results show that
with the increase of the detection ratio, the cumulative number of cases has
dropped significantly, but the decline in the proportion of asymptomatic
infections is not obvious. Therefore, in view of the hidden transmission of
asymptomatic infections, the cooperation between various epidemic prevention
and control policies is required to effectively curb the spread of the
epidemic.

required to sustain billions of lives and thousands of industries.
Unfortunately, as one of the most critical infrastructures of our World, the SG
is an attractive target for attackers. The problem is aggravated by the
increasing adoption of digitalisation, which further increases the SG's
exposure to cyberthreats. Successful exploitation of such exposure leads to
entire countries being paralysed, which is an unacceptable -- but ultimately
inescapable -- risk.
  This paper aims to mitigate this risk by elucidating the perspective of real
practitioners on the cybersecurity of the SG. We interviewed 18 entities,
operating in diverse countries in Europe and covering all domains of the SG --
from energy generation, to its delivery. Our analysis highlights a stark
contrast between (a)research and practice, but also between (b) public and
private entities. For instance: some threats appear to be much less dangerous
than what is claimed in related papers; some technological paradigms have
dubious utility for practitioners, but are actively promoted by literature;
finally, practitioners may either under- or over-estimate their own
cybersecurity capabilities. We derive four takeaways that enable future
endeavours to improve the overall cybersecurity in the SG. We conjecture that
most of the problems are due to an improper communication between researchers,
practitioners and regulatory bodies -- which, despite sharing a common goal,
tend to neglect the viewpoint of the other `spheres'.

encryption as a key mechanism to protect against system-level attackers trying
to read the TEE's content and physical, off-chip attackers, is insufficient.
The recent Cipherleaks attacks infer secret data from TEE-protected
implementations by analyzing ciphertext patterns exhibited due to deterministic
memory encryption. The underlying vulnerability, dubbed the ciphertext
side-channel, is neither protected by state-of-the-art countermeasures like
constant-time code nor by hardware fixes.
  Thus, in this paper, we present a software-based, drop-in solution that can
harden existing binaries such that they can be safely executed under TEEs
vulnerable to ciphertext side-channels, without requiring recompilation. We
combine taint tracking with both static and dynamic binary instrumentation to
find sensitive memory locations, and mitigate the leakage by masking secret

remains deterministic, we destroy any secret-dependent patterns in encrypted

convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The main objective of these methods is to
try to recover finer texture details generating more photo-realistic images
based on the optimisation of an objective function depending basically on the
CNN architecture and training approach. In this work, the authors explore
single image super-resolution using CNNs for iris recognition. For this, they
test different CNN architectures and use different training databases,
validating their approach on a database of 1.872 near infrared iris images and
on a mobile phone image database. They also use quality assessment, visual
results and recognition experiments to verify if the photo-realism provided by
the CNNs which have already proven to be effective for natural images can
reflect in a better recognition rate for iris recognition. The results show
that using deeper architectures trained with texture databases that provide a
balance between edge preservation and the smoothness of the method can lead to
good results in the iris recognition process.

  based on medical claims data",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We explore Markov-modulated marked Poisson processes (MMMPPs) as a natural
framework for modelling patients' disease dynamics over time based on medical
claims data. In claims data, observations do not only occur at random points in
time but are also informative, i.e. driven by unobserved disease levels, as
poor health conditions usually lead to more frequent interactions with the
healthcare system. Therefore, we model the observation process as a
Markov-modulated Poisson process, where the rate of healthcare interactions is
governed by a continuous-time Markov chain. Its states serve as proxies for the
patients' latent disease levels and further determine the distribution of
additional data collected at each observation time, the so-called marks.
Overall, MMMPPs jointly model observations and their informative time points by
comprising two state-dependent processes: the observation process
(corresponding to the event times) and the mark process (corresponding to
event-specific information), which both depend on the underlying states. The
approach is illustrated using claims data from patients diagnosed with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by modelling their drug use and the
interval lengths between consecutive physician consultations. The results
indicate that MMMPPs are able to detect distinct patterns of healthcare
utilisation related to disease processes and reveal inter-individual
differences in the state-switching dynamics.

data. The motivation for such a model originates from real-world observational
data, which often contain groups of samples obtained under heterogeneous
conditions in space and time, potentially resulting in differences in network
structure among groups. Therefore, the i.i.d. assumption is unrealistic, and
fitting a single graphical model on all data results in a network that does not
accurately represent the between group differences. In addition, real-world
observational data is typically of mixed discrete-and-continuous type,
violating the Gaussian assumption that is typical of graphical models, which
leads to the model being unable to adequately recover the underlying graph
structure. The proposed model takes into account these properties of data, by
treating observed data as transformed latent Gaussian data, by means of the
Gaussian copula, and thereby allowing for the attractive properties of the
Gaussian distribution such as estimating the optimal number of model parameter
using the inverse covariance matrix. The multi-group setting is addressed by
jointly fitting a graphical model for each group, and applying the fused group
penalty to fuse similar graphs together. In an extensive simulation study, the
proposed model is evaluated against alternative models, where the proposed
model is better able to recover the true underlying graph structure for
different groups. Finally, the proposed model is applied on real
production-ecological data pertaining to on-farm maize yield in order to
showcase the added value of the proposed method in generating new hypotheses
for production ecologists.

(CKM) matrix element $V_{cb}$ using $B\to D\ell\nu$ decays. The result is based
on $e^+e^-\to\Upsilon(4S)$ data recorded by the Belle II detector corresponding
to 189.2/fb of integrated luminosity. The semileptonic decays $B^0\to D^-(\to
K^+\pi^-\pi^-)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ and $B^+\to\bar D^0(\to K^+\pi^-)\ell^+\nu_\ell$
are reconstructed, where $\ell$ is either electron or a muon. The second $B$
meson in the $\Upsilon(4S)$ event is not explicitly reconstructed. Using the
diamond-frame method, we determine the $B$ meson four-momentum and thus the
hadronic recoil. We extract the partial decay rates as functions of $w$ and
perform a fit to the decay form-factor and the CKM parameter $|V_{cb}|$ using
the BGL parameterization of the form factor and lattice QCD input from the
FNAL/MILC and HPQCD collaborations. We obtain $\eta_{EW}|V_{cb}|=(38.53\pm
1.15)\times 10^{-3}$, where $\eta_{EW}$ is an electroweak correction, and the
error accounts for theoretical and experimental sources of uncertainty.

stars, known to be turbulent. They include a small fraction of dust from which
planets form. In the incremental scenario for planet growth, the formation of
kilometer-size objects (planetesimals) from pebbles is a major open question.
Clustering of particles is necessary for solids to undergo a local
gravitational collapse. To address this question, the dynamic of inertial
particles in turbulent flows with Keplerian rotation and shear is studied.
Two-dimensional direct numerical simulations are performed to explore
systematically two physical parameters: the rotation rate, which depends on the
distance to the star, and the particle response time, which relates to their
size. Shear is found to drastically affect the characteristics of the turbulent
flow destroying cyclones and favoring the survival of anticyclones. Faster
Keplerian rotation enhances clustering of particles. For intermediate sizes,
particles concentrate in anticyclones. These clusters form in a hierarchical
manner and merge together with time. For other parameter values, solids
concentrate on fractal sets that get more singular with rotation. The mass
distribution of particles is then found to be multifractal with small
dimensions at large orders, intriguing for triggering their gravitational
collapse. Such results are promising for a precise description and better
understanding of planetesimal formation.

binarizes both the network parameters and input node attributes and exploits

According to the theoretical analysis, our Bi-GCN can reduce the memory

About 0.2-2% of giant stars are Li-rich, whose lithium abundance
(A(Li)) is higher than 1.5 dex. Among them, near 6% are super Li-rich with
A(Li) exceeding 3.2 dex. Meanwhile, the formation mechanism of these Li-rich
and super Li-rich giants is still under debate. Aims. Considering the compact
He core of red giants, attention is paid to the effect of element diffusion on
A(Li). In particular, when the He core flash occurs, the element diffusion
makes the thermohaline mixing zone extend inward and connect to the inner
convection region of stars. Then, a large amount of 7Be produced by the He
flash can be transferred to stellar surface, finally turning into 7Li. Thus,
the goal of this work is to propose the mechanism of A(Li) enrichment and
achieve the consistency between the theoretical and observation data. Methods.
Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we simulate
the evolution of low-mass stars, with considering the effects of element
diffusion on the Li abundances. The timescale ratio of Li-rich giants to normal
giants is estimated by population synthesis method. Then we get the theoretical
value of A(Li) and make a comparison with observations. Results. Considering
the influence of element diffusion in the model results in the increase of
lithium abundance up to about 1.8dex, which can reveal Li-rich giants.
Simultaneously, introducing high constant diffusive mixing coefficients (Dmix)
with the values from 10e11 to 10e15in the model allows A(Li) to increase from
2.4 to 4.5dex, which can explain the most of Li-rich and super Li-rich giant
stars. The population synthesis method reveals that the amount of Li-rich
giants among giants is about 0.2-2%, which is consistent with observation
estimated levels.

task-agnostic state representation that encodes the geometry of the
environment. A desirable property of LapRep stated in prior works is that the
Euclidean distance in the LapRep space roughly reflects the reachability
between states, which motivates the usage of this distance for reward shaping.
However, we find that LapRep does not necessarily have this property in
general: two states having small distance under LapRep can actually be far away
in the environment. Such mismatch would impede the learning process in reward
shaping. To fix this issue, we introduce a Reachability-Aware Laplacian
Representation (RA-LapRep), by properly scaling each dimension of LapRep.
Despite the simplicity, we demonstrate that RA-LapRep can better capture the
inter-state reachability as compared to LapRep, through both theoretical
explanations and experimental results. Additionally, we show that this
improvement yields a significant boost in reward shaping performance and also
benefits bottleneck state discovery.

Assisted MAP-Elites (PGA-MAP-Elites) algorithm overcomes this limitation by
pairing the traditional Genetic operator of MAP-Elites with a gradient-based

mutations toward high-performing solutions using policy-gradients. In this

science. Its NP-completeness has been used to argue that SAT is intractable.
However, there have been tremendous advances that allow SAT solvers to solve
instances with millions of variables. A particularly successful paradigm is
stochastic local search.
  In most cases, there are different ways of formulating the underlying
problem. While it is known that this has an impact on the runtime of solvers,
finding a helpful formulation is generally non-trivial. The recently introduced
GapSAT solver [Lorenz and W\""orz 2020] demonstrated a successful way to improve
the performance of an SLS solver on average by learning additional information
which logically entails from the original problem. Still, there were cases in
which the performance slightly deteriorated. This justifies in-depth
investigations into how learning logical implications affects runtimes for SLS.
  In this work, we propose a method for generating logically equivalent problem
formulations, generalizing the ideas of GapSAT. This allows a rigorous
mathematical study of the effect on the runtime of SLS solvers. If the
modification process is treated as random, Johnson SB distributions provide a
perfect characterization of the hardness. Since the observed Johnson SB
distributions approach lognormal distributions, our analysis also suggests that
the hardness is long-tailed. As a second contribution, we theoretically prove
that restarts are useful for long-tailed distributions. This implies that
additional restarts can further refine all algorithms employing above mentioned
modification technique. Since the empirical studies compellingly suggest that
the runtime distributions follow Johnson SB distributions, we investigate this
property theoretically. We succeed in proving that the runtimes for
Sch\""oning's random walk algorithm are approximately Johnson SB.

  In this paper, we introduce a novel explainability framework that aims to

state-of-the-art transformer encoder model. More specifically, we process the
attention weights of a trained transformer encoder to reveal the critical dates
for crop disambiguation and use domain knowledge to uncover the phenological
events that support the model performance. We also present a sensitivity

crop-specific phenological events.
  We report compelling results showing that attention patterns strongly relate
to key dates, and consequently, to the critical phenological events for
crop-type classification. These findings might be relevant for improving
stakeholder trust and optimizing agriculture monitoring processes.
Additionally, our sensitivity analysis demonstrates the limitation of attention
weights for identifying the important events in the crop phenology as we
empirically show that the unveiled phenological events depend on the other
crops in the data considered during training.

centralized control setting in most existing strategies limits their
scalability for large-scale mixed traffic flow. To address this problem, this
paper proposes a cooperative DeeP-LCC (Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise

cooperative DeeP-LCC, the traffic system is naturally partitioned into multiple

both computation and communication efficiency, as well as trajectory data

appreciate the subtleties of free versus bound dynamics, two cases are
discussed. First, the soliton dynamics exhibited by a coherent superposition of

both the peak-to-peak distance between the two initial clouds and the addition
of a phase difference between them. In the latter case, an interesting

It's a well founded and intuitive fact that existing bias mitigation strategies

prediction is used for decision making which reflects on revenue or operational
efficiency such as credit risk modelling, it would be desirable by the business
if accuracy can be somehow reasonably preserved. This conflicting requirement

data preprocessing technique that can detect instances ascribing a specific

further show that such instance removal will have no adverse impact on model

exist with similar feature but different labels caused by variation in
protected attributes , an inherent bias gets induced in the dataset, which can
be identified and mitigated through our novel scheme. Our experimental
evaluation on two open-source datasets demonstrates how the proposed method can
mitigate bias along with improving rather than degrading accuracy, while

surplus of each consumer in a segment depends on the price that the seller
optimally charges, which depends on the set of consumers in the segment. We
study which segmentations may result from the interaction among consumers and
the seller. Instead of studying the interaction as a non-cooperative game, we
take a reduced-form approach and introduce a notion of stability that any
resulting segmentation must satisfy. A stable segmentation is one that, for any
alternative segmentation, contains a segment of consumers that prefers the
original segmentation to the alternative one. Our main result characterizes
stable segmentations as efficient and saturated. A segmentation is saturated if
no consumers can be shifted from a segment with a high price to a segment with
a low price without the seller optimally increasing the low price. We use this
characterization to constructively show that stable segmentations always exist.
Even though stable segmentations are efficient, they need not maximize average
consumer surplus, and segmentations that maximize average consumer surplus need
not be stable. Finally, we relate our notion of stability to solution concepts

heating models on the formation behaviour of solar prominences. These models
consider either an exponential variation dependent on height alone, or local
density and magnetic field conditions. We highlight and address some of the
limitations inherent to these early approximations by proposing a new, dynamic
2D flux rope heating model that qualitatively accounts for the 3D topology of
the twisted flux rope field. Methods. We performed 2.5D grid-adaptive numerical
simulations of prominence formation via the levitation-condensation mechanism.
A linear force-free arcade is subjected to shearing and converging motions,
leading to the formation of a flux rope containing material that may succumb to
thermal instability. The eventual formation and subsequent evolution of
prominence condensations was then quantified as a function of the specific
background heating prescription adopted. For the simulations that consider the
topology of the flux rope, reduced heating was considered within a dynamically
evolving ellipse that traces the flux rope cross-section. This ellipse is
centred on the flux rope axis and tracked during runtime using an approach
based on the instantaneous magnetic field curvature. Results. We find that the
nature of the heating model is clearly imprinted on the evolution and
morphology of any resulting prominences: one large, low-altitude condensation
is obtained for the heating model based on local parameters, while the
exponential model leads to the additional formation of smaller blobs throughout
the flux rope which then relocate as they tend towards achieving hydrostatic
equilibrium. Finally, a study of the condensation process in phase space
reveals a non-isobaric evolution with an eventual recovery of uniform pressure

microwave background (CMB) radiation from the sky, obtaining the Stokes
parameters of the incoming signal simultaneously, in a frequency range from 10
to 20 GHz. A linearly polarized input signal with a variable polarization angle
is used as excitation in the polarimeter calibration setup mounted in the
laboratory. The polarimeter systematic errors can be corrected with the
proposed calibration procedure, achieving high levels of polarization
efficiency (low polarization percentage errors) and low polarization angle
errors. The calibration method is based on the fitting of polarization errors
by means of sinusoidal functions composed of additive or multiplicative terms.
The accuracy of the fitting increases with the number of terms in such a way
that the typical error levels required in low-frequency CMB experiments can be
achieved with only a few terms in the fitting functions. On the other hand,
assuming that the calibration signal is known with the required accuracy,
additional terms can be calculated to reach the error levels needed in
ultrasensitive B-mode polarization CMB experiments.

  Random Fourier Features",,,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Many applications of quantum computing in the near term rely on variational
quantum circuits (VQCs). They have been showcased as a promising model for
reaching a quantum advantage in machine learning with current noisy
intermediate scale quantum computers (NISQ). It is often believed that the
power of VQCs relies on their exponentially large feature space, and extensive
works have explored the expressiveness and trainability of VQCs in that regard.
In our work, we propose a classical sampling method that may closely
approximate a VQC with Hamiltonian encoding, given only the description of its
architecture. It uses the seminal proposal of Random Fourier Features (RFF) and
the fact that VQCs can be seen as large Fourier series. We provide general
theoretical bounds for classically approximating models built from
exponentially large quantum feature space by sampling a few frequencies to
build an equivalent low dimensional kernel, and we show experimentally that
this approximation is efficient for several encoding strategies. Precisely, we
show that the number of required samples grows favorably with the size of the
quantum spectrum. This tool therefore questions the hope for quantum advantage
from VQCs in many cases, but conversely helps to narrow the conditions for
their potential success. We expect VQCs with various and complex encoding
Hamiltonians, or with large input dimension, to become more robust to classical
approximations.

number of works have tried to fix--or at least uncover the source of--the
problem with limited success. In this paper, we identify a simple criterion
under which models are significantly more likely to assign more probability to
hallucinated content during generation: high model uncertainty. This finding
offers a potential explanation for hallucinations: models default to favoring
text with high marginal probability, i.e., high-frequency occurrences in the
training set, when uncertain about a continuation. It also motivates possible
routes for real-time intervention during decoding to prevent such
hallucinations. We propose a decoding strategy that switches to optimizing for
pointwise mutual information of the source and target token--rather than purely
the probability of the target token--when the model exhibits uncertainty.
Experiments on the XSum dataset show that our method decreases the probability
of hallucinated tokens while maintaining the Rouge and BertS scores of
top-performing decoding strategies.

graph can be expressed as a union of at most five perfect matchings. This
conjecture trivially holds for $3$-edge-colourable cubic graphs, but remains
widely open for graphs that are not $3$-edge-colourable. The aim of this paper
is to verify the validity of Berge's conjecture for cubic graphs that are in a
certain sense close to $3$-edge-colourable graphs. We measure the closeness by
looking at the colouring defect, which is defined as the minimum number of
edges left uncovered by any collection of three perfect matchings. While
$3$-edge-colourable graphs have defect $0$, every bridgeless cubic graph with
no $3$-edge-colouring has defect at least $3$. In 2015, Steffen proved that the
Berge conjecture holds for cyclically $4$-edge-connected cubic graphs with
colouring defect $3$ or $4$. Our aim is to improve Steffen's result in two
ways. First, we show that all bridgeless cubic graphs with defect $3$ satisfy
Berge's conjecture irrespectively of their cyclic connectivity. Second, we
prove that if the graph in question is cyclically $4$-edge-connected, then four
perfect matchings suffice, unless the graph is the Petersen graph. The result

set of languages and linguistic structures, leaving the actual typological
diversity knowledge out of scope. In this paper, we present and apply the
GUI-assisted framework allowing us to easily probe a massive number of
languages for all the morphosyntactic features present in the Universal
Dependencies data. We show that reflecting the anglo-centric trend in NLP over
the past years, most of the regularities revealed in the mBERT model are

practitioners to use and share their standard probing methods to interpret

flaws in multilingual models, providing a reproducible experimental setup for

represents its unique linear extension. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this
construction leads to a linear, time-local quantum master equation with
generalized Lindblad structure involving time-dependent, possibly negative

user security against both on- and off-chain analysis.
  To achieve this goal, we propose the following pair of contributions: the
DACT protocol and the SurferMonkey infrastructure that supports the DACT
protocol. The DACT protocol is a global solution for the anonymity and security
challenges of agnostic blockchain intercommunication. DACT breaks on- and
off-chain analysis thanks to the use of ZKPs. SurferMonkey is a decentralized
infrastructure that implements DACT in practice. Since SurferMonkey works at
the blockchain application layer, any decentralized application (dApp) can use
SurferMonkey to send any type of message to a dApp on another blockchain. With
SurferMonkey, users can neither be censored nor be exposed to MEV. By applying
decentralized proactive security, we obtain resilience against selfish rational
players, and raise the security bar against cyberattacks. We have implemented a
proof of concept (PoC) of SurferMonkey by reverse engineering Tornado Cash and
by applying IDEN3 ZKP circuits. SurferMonkey enables new usecases, ranging from
anonymous voting and gaming, to a new phase of anonymous decentralized finance
(aDeFi).

contact state analysis. Reinforcement learning (RL) is gradually becoming a
preferred method of controlling robotic peg-in-hole assembly tasks. However,
the training process of RL is quite time-consuming because RL methods are
always globally connected, which means all state components are assumed to be
the input of policies for all action components, thus increasing action space
and state space to be explored. In this paper, we first define continuous space
serialized Shapley value (CS3) and construct a connection graph to clarify the
correlativity of action components on state components. Then we propose a local
connection reinforcement learning (LCRL) method based on the connection graph,
which eliminates the influence of irrelevant state components on the selection
of action components. The simulation and experiment results demonstrate that
the control strategy obtained through LCRL method improves the stability and
rapidity of the control process. LCRL method will enhance the data-efficiency
and increase the final reward of the training process.

years new omnibus tests and methods based on the restricted mean survival time
appeared that have been strongly recommended in biometric literature. Thus, to
give updated recommendations, we perform a vast simulation study to compare
tests that showed high power in previous studies with these more recent

their practical use is often times not yet well understood. In this work we
therefore analyze the concept of a futuristic large-scale robotic factory,
where each robot has a computing unit associated to it. The computing unit
assists the robot with large computational tasks that have to be performed in
real-time. Each robot moves randomly in a vicinity of its computing unit, and
in addition both the robot and the unit can change location. To minimize
latency, the connection is assumed as optical wireless. Due to the mobility, a
permanent optimal assignment of frequency bands is assumed to increase
communication latency and is therefore ruled out. Under such assumptions, we
compare the different capacity scaling of different types of such
architectures, where the one is built utilizing quantum communication
techniques, and the other based on conventional design methods.

flow of an Oldroyd-B fluid and a deformable channel. Specifically, we provide a
theoretical framework for calculating the leading-order effect of the fluid's
viscoelasticity on the flow rate-pressure drop relation and on the deformation
of the channel's elastic wall. We first identify the characteristic scales and
dimensionless parameters governing the fluid-structure interaction in slender
and shallow channels. Applying the lubrication approximation for the flow and
employing a perturbation expansion in powers of the Deborah number $De$, we
derive a closed-form expression for the pressure as a function of the
non-uniform shape of the channel in the weakly viscoelastic limit up to
$\mathrm{O}(De)$. Coupling the hydrodynamic pressure to the elastic
deformation, we provide the leading-order effect of the interplay between the
viscoelasticity of the fluid and the compliance of the channel on the pressure
and deformation fields, as well as on the flow rate-pressure drop relation. For
the flow-rate-controlled regime and in the weakly viscoelastic limit, we show
analytically that both the compliance of the deforming top wall and the
viscoelasticity of the fluid decrease the pressure drop. Furthermore, we reveal
a trade-off between the influence of compliance of the channel and the fluid's
viscoelasticity on the deformation. While the channel's compliance increases
the deformation, the fluid's viscoelasticity decreases it.

patterns are formed due to the complex interference within the fiber. The
extreme sensitivity of speckle patterns to the frequency of light paved the way
for high-resolution multimode fiber spectrometers. However, this approach
requires expensive IR cameras and impedes the integration of spectrometers

by exploiting wavefront shaping. The input light is structured with the help of
a spatial light modulator, and optimal phase masks, focusing light at the

We also demonstrate the reconstruction of broadband continuous spectra for

using the far-field Green's function and the Born approximation, assuming a
small acoustic impedance difference between the host and inclusion materials.
The numerical finite element (FE) model is established to deliver relatively
accurate simulation of the scattering problem and to evaluate the
approximations of the theoretical model. Quantitative agreement is observed
between the theoretical model and the FE results for arbitrarily-shaped
surface/subsurface inclusions with isotropic/anisotropic properties. The
agreement is excellent when the wavelength of the Rayleigh wave is larger than,

""geometry-aware'"" solution to this open problem by introducing a DL
model-design framework that takes suitable infinite-dimensional linear metric

main result states that the models produced by our framework can uniformly
approximate on compact sets and across arbitrarily finite-time horizons
H\""older or smooth trace class operators, which causally map sequences between
given linear metric spaces. Our analysis uncovers new quantitative
relationships on the latent state-space dimension of CNOs which even have new
implications for (classical) finite-dimensional Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs). We find that a linear increase of the CNO's (or RNN's) latent parameter
space's dimension and of its width, and a logarithmic increase of its depth
imply an exponential increase in the number of time steps for which its
approximation remains valid. A direct consequence of our analysis shows that
RNNs can approximate causal functions using exponentially fewer parameters than

its analytical evaluations for an important family of dual-unitary and for

unitary, the existence of a pair of maximally entangled states that it
connects. We give efficient numerical algorithms to find such states and to

unsupervised clustering of plasma concentration-time curves, hereafter,
pharmacokinetic (PK) curves. This can be done by treating a PK curve as a time

to the clustering of time series data objects. In this paper, we introduce
hierarchical clustering within the context of clustering PK curves and find it
to be effective at identifying similar-shaped PK curves and informative for
understanding patterns of PK curves via its dendrogram data visualization. We
also examine many dissimilarity measures between time series objects to
identify Euclidean distance as generally most appropriate for clustering PK
curves. We further show that dynamic time warping, Fr\'echet, and
structure-based measures of dissimilarity like correlation may produce
unexpected results. Finally, we apply these methods to a dataset of 250 PK
curves as an illustrative case study to demonstrate how the clustering of PK
curves can be used as a descriptive tool for summarizing and visualizing
complex PK data, which may enhance the study of pharmacogenomics in the context
of precision medicine.

situations, their ability to grasp social dynamics becomes crucial. In this
work, we examine the open question of social intelligence and Theory of Mind in
modern NLP systems from an empirical and theory-based perspective. We show that
one of today's largest language models (GPT-3; Brown et al., 2020) lacks this
kind of social intelligence out-of-the box, using two tasks: SocialIQa (Sap et
al., 2019), which measures models' ability to understand intents and reactions
of participants of social interactions, and ToMi (Le et al., 2019), which
measures whether models can infer mental states and realities of participants
of situations. Our results show that models struggle substantially at these
Theory of Mind tasks, with well-below-human accuracies of 55% and 60% on
SocialIQa and ToMi, respectively. To conclude, we draw on theories from
pragmatics to contextualize this shortcoming of large language models, by
examining the limitations stemming from their data, neural architecture, and
training paradigms. Challenging the prevalent narrative that only scale is
needed, we posit that person-centric NLP approaches might be more effective
towards neural Theory of Mind.

there general families of SIIRVs with unbounded support that can be learned
with sample complexity independent of both $n$ and the maximal element of the
support? (ii) Are there general families of SIIRVs with unbounded support that
admit proper sparse covers in total variation distance? As for question (i), we
provide a set of simple conditions that allow the unbounded SIIRV to be learned
with complexity $\text{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ bypassing the aforementioned lower
bound. We further address question (ii) in the general setting where each
variable $X_i$ has unimodal probability mass function and is a different member
of some, possibly multi-parameter, exponential family $\mathcal{E}$ that
satisfies some structural properties. These properties allow $\mathcal{E}$ to
contain heavy tailed and non log-concave distributions. Moreover, we show that
for every $\epsilon > 0$, and every $k$-parameter family $\mathcal{E}$ that
satisfies some structural assumptions, there exists an algorithm with
$\tilde{O}(k) \cdot \text{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ samples that learns a sum of $n$
arbitrary members of $\mathcal{E}$ within $\epsilon$ in TV distance. The output
of the learning algorithm is also a sum of random variables whose distribution
lies in the family $\mathcal{E}$. En route, we prove that any discrete unimodal
exponential family with bounded constant-degree central moments can be
approximated by the family corresponding to a bounded subset of the initial

various computer vision applications. In this paper, we propose the first
method using a Dual-Pixel (DP) sensor to better address the raindrop removal.
Our key observation is that raindrops attached to a glass window yield
noticeable disparities in DP's left-half and right-half images, while almost no
disparity exists for in-focus backgrounds. Therefore, DP disparities can be
utilized for robust raindrop detection. The DP disparities also brings the
advantage that the occluded background regions by raindrops are shifted between
the left-half and the right-half images. Therefore, fusing the information from
the left-half and the right-half images can lead to more accurate background
texture recovery. Based on the above motivation, we propose a DP Raindrop
Removal Network (DPRRN) consisting of DP raindrop detection and DP fused
raindrop removal. To efficiently generate a large amount of training data, we

new type of scattering resonances that is universal for a wide range of polar
molecules. The so-called field-linked resonances occur in the scattering of
microwave-dressed molecules due to stable macroscopic tetramer states in the
intermolecular potential. We identify two resonances between ultracold
ground-state sodium-potassium molecules and use the microwave frequencies and
polarizations to tune the inelastic collision rate by three orders of
magnitude, from the unitary limit to well below the universal regime. The
field-linked resonance provides a tuning knob to independently control the
elastic contact interaction and the dipole-dipole interaction, which we observe
as a modification in the thermalization rate. Our result provides a general
strategy for resonant scattering between ultracold polar molecules, which paves

data is different from general images in at least two aspects: i) sample size
is usually much more limited, ii) model interpretation is more of a concern
compared to outcome prediction. Due to its unique nature, general methods, such
as convolutional neural network (CNN), are difficult to be directly applied. As
such, we propose DKN, that is able to i) adapt to low sample size limitation,
ii) provide desired model interpretation, and iii) achieve the prediction power
as CNN. The DKN is general in the sense that it not only works for both matrix
and (high-order) tensor represented image data, but also could be applied to
both discrete and continuous outcomes. The DKN is built on a Kronecker product
structure and implicitly imposes a piecewise smooth property on coefficients.
Moreover, the Kronecker structure can be written into a convolutional form, so
DKN also resembles a CNN, particularly, a fully convolutional network (FCN).
Furthermore, we prove that with an alternating minimization algorithm, the
solutions of DKN are guaranteed to converge to the truth geometrically even if
the objective function is highly nonconvex. Interestingly, the DKN is also
highly connected to the tensor regression framework proposed by Zhou et al.
(2010), where a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) low-rank structure is imposed on tensor
coefficients. Finally, we conduct both classification and regression analyses
using real MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
to demonstrate the effectiveness of DKN.

success of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Direct measurements of the Hubble constant
$H_0$ using Cepheid variables and supernovae turn out to be higher than
inferred from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Weak galaxy lensing
surveys consistently report values of the strength of matter clustering
$\sigma_8$ lower than values derived from the CMB in the context of
$\Lambda$CDM. In this paper we address these discrepancies in cosmological
parameters by considering Dark Energy (DE) as a fluid with evolving equation of
state $w_{\mathrm{de}}(z)$, constant sound speed squared
$\hat{c}_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}$, and vanishing anisotropic stress $\sigma$. Our
$w_{\mathrm{de}}(z)$ is derived from the Holographic Principle and can
consecutively exhibit radiation-like, matter-like, and DE-like behaviour, thus
affecting the sound horizon and the comoving angular diameter distance, hence
$H_0$. Here we show DE sound speed plays a part in the matter clustering
behaviour through its effect on the evolution of the gravitational potential.
We compute cosmological constraints using several data set combinations
including primary CMB, CMB lensing, redshift-space-distortions, local
distance-ladder, supernovae, and baryon acoustic oscillations. In our analysis
we marginalise over $\hat{c}_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}$ and find
$\hat{c}_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}=1$ is excluded at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$. For our baseline
result including the whole data set we found $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ in good
agreement (within $\approx 2\sigma$) with low redshift probes. Our constraint
for the baryon energy density $\omega_{\rm{b}}$ is however in $\approx 3\sigma$
tension with BBN constraints. We conclude evolving DE also having non-standard
clustering properties [e.g., $\hat{c}_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}(z,k)$] might be relevant
for the solution of current discrepancies in cosmological parameters.

deformation parameter a large center, similar to affine Lie algebras at

a bundle over the variety defined by this large center. The zero-fibre becomes
a vertex algebra, the other fibres become twisted modules over this vertex
algebra.
  We explore these ideas and a conjectural correspondence in a class of vertex
algebras $A^{(p)}[\mathfrak{g},\kappa]$ associated to a choice of a
finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra and an integer $(\mathfrak{g},p)$ and
a level $\kappa$, and some related algebras. These algebras were introduced
under the name quantum geometric Langlands kernels and have an interpretation
in 4-dimensional quantum field theory. In the limit $\kappa\to \infty$, they
acquire a large central subalgebra identified with the ring of functions on the
space of $\mathfrak{g}$-connections. The zero-fibre is expected to be the
Feigin-Tipunin algebra $W_p(\mathfrak{g})$, whose category of representations
is expected to be equivalent to the small quantum group by the logarithmic
Kazhdan Lusztig conjecture.
  Our rigorous results focus on the cases $(\mathfrak{g},1)$ and
$(\mathfrak{sl}_2,2)$. In the first part of the paper, which might be of

$W_2(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, and introduce a method of twisted free field
realization to obtain twisted modules for arbitrary $(\mathfrak{g},p)$. We also
match our findings to the respective quantum group with big center. In the
second part of the paper we match the results to the vertex algebra bundle we
compute from the limit of $A^{(p)}[\mathfrak{g},\kappa]$, which in our cases
have realizations as GKO coset resp. N=4 superconformal algebras.

experience an extreme loss of volatiles because of atmospheric evaporation in
the early stages of their life. Though the mechanisms behind the extreme mass
loss are not fully understood, two contenders have been widely discussed:
photoevaporation from X-ray and ultraviolet irradiation and core powered mass
loss. Here, it is shown that both mechanisms occur but with different
timescales, and that atmospheric loss can take place over three regimes. In the
first regime, a planet has very high internal temperatures arising from its
high-energy formation processes. These high temperatures give rise to a fully
convecting atmosphere that efficiently loses mass without much internal
cooling. The second regime applies to planets with lower internal temperatures,
so a radiative region forms but the photosphere still remains outside the Bondi
radius. Hence, mass loss continues to depend only on the internal temperatures.
Planets with the lowest internal temperatures are in the third regime, when the
photosphere forms below the Bondi radius and mass is lost primarily because of
X-ray and ultraviolet irradiation. This paper provides the first unifying

measuring an observable of a quantum system. As it can only be tested by
measuring many copies of the system under consideration, it cannot hold
strictly for non-replicable systems. For these systems, we give a procedure to
predict the future statistics of measurement outcomes through Repeated
Measurements (RM). We prove that if the statistics of the results acquired via
RM is sufficiently similar to that obtained by the Born rule, the latter can be
used effectively. We apply our framework to a repeatedly measured Unruh-DeWitt
detector interacting with a massless scalar quantum field, which is an example
of a system (detector) interacting with an uncontrollable environment (field)
for which using RM is necessary. Analysing what an observer learns from the RM
outcomes, we find a regime where history-dependent RM probabilities are close
to the Born ones. Consequently, the latter can be used for all practical
purposes. Finally, we study numerically inertial and accelerated detectors
showing that an observer can see the Unruh effect via RM.

of the lens potential in the singular perturbative approach. These minimal
solutions corresponds to an expansion with a minimal degree in Fourier
expansion of the perturbative fields. Using these minimal solutions prevent
spurious physically meaningless terms in the reconstruction of the fields. In
effect a perturbative analysis indicates that a small change in the source
model will corresponds to the higher order terms in the expansion of the
fields. The results of the perturbative analysis are valid not only for
slightly non-circular sources but also for more distorted sources to order two.
It is thus of crucial importance to minimize the number of terms used in the
modelling of the lens. Another important asset of the minimal solutions is that
they offers a de-coupling between the source and lens model and thus help to
break the source lens degeneracy issue. The possible drawback of minimal
solutions is to under-estimate the higher order terms in the solution. However
this bias has its merit since the detection of higher order terms using this
method will ensure that these terms are real. This type of analysis using
minimal solutions will be of particular interest when considering the
statistical analysis of a large number of lenses, especially in light of the
incoming satellite surveys.

normalisation of casing), therefore assuming a-priori knowledge of both the
audio and text distributions. This tuning requirement can lead to systems
failing to generalise to other datasets and domains. To promote the development
of multi-domain speech systems, we introduce the End-to-end Speech Benchmark
(ESB) for evaluating the performance of a single automatic speech recognition
(ASR) system across a broad set of speech datasets. Benchmarked systems must
use the same data pre- and post-processing algorithm across datasets - assuming
the audio and text data distributions are a-priori unknown. We compare a series
of state-of-the-art (SoTA) end-to-end (E2E) systems on this benchmark,
demonstrating how a single speech system can be applied and evaluated on a wide
range of data distributions. We find E2E systems to be effective across
datasets: in a fair comparison, E2E systems achieve within 2.6% of SoTA systems
tuned to a specific dataset. Our analysis reveals that transcription artefacts,
such as punctuation and casing, pose difficulties for ASR systems and should be
included in evaluation. We believe E2E benchmarking over a range of datasets
promotes the research of multi-domain speech recognition systems. ESB is

studying cell polarisation. It is constituted by a surface reaction-diffusion
equation, coupled to a bulk diffusion equation with a non-linear boundary
condition. Cell polarisation arises as the surface component develops specific
patterns. Since proteins diffuse much faster in the cell interior than on the
membrane, in the literature, the bulk component is often assumed to be
spatially homogeneous. {\re Therefore, the model can be reduced to a single
surface equation}. However, {\re in real applications} a spatially non-uniform

paper, we study, through numerical computations, the role of the bulk component

polarisation response. We find that the bulk component is indeed a key factor
in {\re determining the surface polarisation response}. Moreover, for certain
geometries, it is the spatial heterogeneity of the bulk component that triggers
the polarisation response, which might not be possible in a reduced model.
  Understanding how polarisation depends on bulk diffusivity might be crucial
when studying models of migrating cells, which are naturally subject to domain
deformation.

applications, from self-driving cars and augmented reality systems to domestic
robots. We argue that a spherical representation is a natural one for
egocentric pointclouds. Thus, in this work, we present a novel framework
exploiting such a representation of LiDAR pointclouds for the task of semantic
segmentation. Our approach is based on a spherical convolutional neural network
that can seamlessly handle observations from various sensor systems (e.g.,
different LiDAR systems) and provides an accurate segmentation of the
environment. We operate in two distinct stages: First, we encode the projected
input pointclouds to spherical features. Second, we decode and back-project the
spherical features to achieve an accurate semantic segmentation of the
pointcloud. We evaluate our method with respect to state-of-the-art
projection-based semantic segmentation approaches using well-known public
datasets. We demonstrate that the spherical representation enables us to
provide more accurate segmentation and to have a better generalization to
sensors with different field-of-view and number of beams than what was seen
during training.

how clusters evolve across cosmic time. Our first goal is to establish if
spectra from the central regions of a subclass of NCCs known as cool core
remnants (CCRs) are consistent with having a small but significant amount of
short cooling time gas, thereby allowing a transformation to CC systems on a
timescale of a giga year. Our second goal is to determine if low ionization Fe
lines emitted from this residual cool gas will be detectable by the
calorimeters that will fly on board XRISM and ATHENA. We performed a spectral
analysis of CCR systems with a multi temperature model and, assuming the
different components to be in pressure equilibrium with one another, derived
entropy and cooling time distributions for the X-ray emitting gas. We find that
in most of our systems, the spectral model allows for a fraction of low
entropy, short cooling time gas with a mass that is comparable to the one in CC
systems. Moreover, simulations show that future spectrometers on board XRISM
and ATHENA will have the power to directly resolve emission lines from the low
temperature gas, thereby providing incontrovertible evidence for its presence.
Within the scenario that we have explored, the constant fraction of CCs
measured across cosmic time emerges from a dynamical equilibrium where CCs
transformed in NCCs through mergers are balanced by NCCs that revert to CCs.
Furthermore, CCs and NCCs should not be viewed as distinct sub classes, but as
``states"" between which clusters can move.

drastically be reduced with minimal cost on accuracy. The resulting networks
are appealing for certain edge computing applications that are subject to

It predicts missing links by reasoning on existing facts. Knowledge graph
embedding (KGE) is one of the most popular methods to address this problem. It
embeds entities and relations into low-dimensional vectors and uses the learned
entity/relation embeddings to predict missing facts. However, KGE only uses
zeroth-order (propositional) logic to encode existing triplets (e.g., ``Alice
is Bob's wife.""); it is unable to leverage first-order (predicate) logic to
represent generally applicable logical \textbf{rules} (e.g., ``$\forall x,y
\colon x ~\text{is}~ y\text{'s wife} \rightarrow y ~\text{is}~ x\text{'s
husband}$''). On the other hand, traditional rule-based KG reasoning methods
usually rely on hard logical rule inference, making it brittle and hardly
competitive with KGE. In this paper, we propose RulE, a novel and principled
framework to represent and model logical rules and triplets. RulE jointly
represents entities, relations and logical rules in a unified embedding space.
By learning an embedding for each logical rule, RulE can perform logical rule
inference in a soft way and give a confidence score to each grounded rule,
similar to how KGE gives each triplet a confidence score. Compared to KGE
alone, RulE allows injecting prior logical rule information into the embedding
space, which improves the generalization of knowledge graph embedding. Besides,
the learned confidence scores of rules improve the logical rule inference
process by softly controlling the contribution of each rule, which alleviates
the brittleness of logic. We evaluate our method with link prediction tasks.
Experimental results on multiple benchmark KGs demonstrate the effectiveness of
RulE.

text-to-speech models while ensuring a certain performance due to its high
parallelism. We propose a new text-to-speech system based on deep convolutional
neural networks that does not employ any RNN components (recurrent units). At
the same time, we improve the generality and robustness of our model through a
series of data augmentation methods such as Time Warping, Frequency Mask, and
Time Mask. The final experimental results show that the TTS model using only
the CNN component can reduce the training time compared to the classic TTS
models such as Tacotron while ensuring the quality of the synthesized speech.

as long ago as 1999. However, the potential of this discovery to provide useful
neural computation has yet to be demonstrated. Here we show for the first time
how a transformative L5PCs-driven deep neural network (DNN), termed the
multisensory cooperative computing (MCC) architecture, can effectively process
large amounts of heterogeneous real-world audio-visual (AV) data, using far
less energy compared to best available 'point' neuron-driven DNNs. A novel
highly-distributed parallel implementation on a Xilinx UltraScale+ MPSoC device
estimates energy savings up to 245759 $ \times $ 50000 $\mu$J (i.e., 62% less
than the baseline model in a semi-supervised learning setup) where a single
synapse consumes $8e^{-5}\mu$J. In a supervised learning setup, the
energy-saving can potentially reach up to 1250x less (per feedforward
transmission) than the baseline model. The significantly reduced neural
activity in MCC leads to inherently fast learning and resilience against sudden
neural damage. This remarkable performance in pilot experiments demonstrates
the embodied neuromorphic intelligence of our proposed cooperative L5PC that
receives input from diverse neighbouring neurons as context to amplify the
transmission of most salient and relevant information for onward transmission,
from overwhelmingly large multimodal information utilised at the early stages
of on-chip training. Our proposed approach opens new cross-disciplinary avenues
for future on-chip DNN training implementations and posits a radical shift in
current neuromorphic computing paradigms.

from Indian government and private websites, still struggles to make the right
choices. They are constantly faced with the dilemma of choosing the right crop
to address market demand and fetch them a decent profit. Since the process of
shortlisting crops amongst the many suitable ones isn't completely scientific
and usually dictated by area tradition, this project has aimed to address that
issue by forecasting the price of those crops and uses that to create an
optimal portfolio that the farmers can obtain to arrive at a data-driven

  Representation Learning",,,,,"cs.NE cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph representation learning is a fundamental research issue and benefits a
wide range of applications on graph-structured data. Conventional artificial
neural network-based methods such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and
variational graph auto-encoders (VGAEs) have achieved promising results in
learning on graphs, but they suffer from extremely high energy consumption
during training and inference stages. Inspired by the bio-fidelity and
energy-efficiency of spiking neural networks (SNNs), recent methods attempt to
adapt GNNs to the SNN framework by substituting spiking neurons for the
activation functions. However, existing SNN-based GNN methods cannot be applied
to the more general multi-node representation learning problem represented by
link prediction. Moreover, these methods did not fully exploit the bio-fidelity
of SNNs, as they still require costly multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations,
which severely harm the energy efficiency. To address the above issues and
improve energy efficiency, in this paper, we propose an SNN-based deep
generative method, namely the Spiking Variational Graph Auto-Encoders (S-VGAE)
for efficient graph representation learning. To deal with the multi-node
problem, we propose a probabilistic decoder that generates binary latent
variables as spiking node representations and reconstructs graphs via the
weighted inner product. To avoid the MAC operations for energy efficiency, we
further decouple the propagation and transformation layers of conventional GNN
aggregators. We conduct link prediction experiments on multiple benchmark graph
datasets, and the results demonstrate that our model consumes significantly
lower energy with the performances superior or comparable to other ANN- and
SNN-based methods for graph representation learning.

excellent barriers to molecular hydrogen. However, it remains an open question
whether large-area layers fabricated by industrially relevant methods preserve
such promising properties. In this work we show that electron beam-induced
splitting of water creates hBN bubbles that effectively store molecular
hydrogen for weeks and under extreme mechanical deformation. We demonstrate
that epitaxial hBN allows direct visualization and monitoring of the process of

activation are associated with the metabolic processes necessary to supply the
energy needed for their respective tasks at rest and during neuronal
activation. Metabolism, in turn, relies on the delivery of metabolites and
removal of toxic byproducts through diffusion processes and the cerebral blood
flow. A comprehensive mathematical model of brain metabolism should account not
only for the biochemical processes and the interaction of neurons and
astrocytes, but also the diffusion of metabolites. In the present article, we
present a computational methodology based on a multidomain model of the brain
tissue and a homogenization argument for the diffusion processes. In our
spatially distributed compartment model, communication between compartments
occur both through local transport fluxes, as is the case within local
astrocyte-neuron complexes, and through diffusion of some substances in some of
the compartments. The model assumes that diffusion takes place in the
extracellular space (ECS) and in the astrocyte compartment. In the astrocyte
compartment, the diffusion across the syncytium network is implemented as a
function of gap junction strength. The diffusion process is implemented
numerically by means of a finite element method (FEM) based spatial
discretization, and robust stiff solvers are used to time integrate the
resulting large system. Computed experiments show the effects of ECS
tortuosity, gap junction strength and spatial anisotropy in the astrocyte
network on the brain energy metabolism.

thereby benefiting from: (i) the superior geometric description and
per-Degree-Of-Freedom accuracy of IGA for capturing global, regular responses,
and (ii) the ability of FEM to compute local, strongly non-linear or even
singular behaviors. For the sake of minimizing the implementation effort, we
develop a coupling scheme that is fully non-invasive in the sense that the
initial global spline model to be enriched is never modified and the
construction of the coupling operators can be performed using conventional FE
packages. The key ingredient is to express the FEM-to-IGA bridge, based on
B{\'e}zier extraction, to transform the initial global spline interface into a
FE one on which the local FE mesh can be constructed. This allows to resort to
classic FE trace operators to implement the coupling. It results in a strategy
that offers the opportunity to simply couple an isogeometric code with any
robust FE code suitable for the modelling of complex local behaviors. The
method also easily extends in case the users only have at their disposal FE
codes. This is the situation that is considered for the numerical
illustrations. More precisely, we only make use of the FE industrial software
