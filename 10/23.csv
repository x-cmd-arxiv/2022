logical reasoning capabilities in complex real-life scenarios. Current
explanation datasets often employ synthetic data with simple reasoning
structures. Therefore, it cannot express more complex reasoning processes, such
as the rebuttal to a reasoning step and the degree of certainty of the
evidence. To this end, we propose a comprehensive logical reasoning explanation
form. Based on the multi-hop chain of reasoning, the explanation form includes
three main components: (1) The condition of rebuttal that the reasoning node
can be challenged; (2) Logical formulae that uncover the internal texture of
reasoning nodes; (3) Reasoning strength indicated by degrees of certainty. The
fine-grained structure conforms to the real logical reasoning scenario, better
fitting the human cognitive process but, simultaneously, is more challenging
for the current models. We evaluate the current best models' performance on
this new explanation form. The experimental results show that generating
reasoning graphs remains a challenging task for current models, even with the
help of giant pre-trained language models.

construct ML models and estimate the oil and/or gas RF. Using two databases and
the cross-validation method, we evaluated the performance of the ML models. In
each iteration 90 and 10% of the data were respectively used to train and test
the models. The third independent database was then used to further assess the
constructed models. For both oil and gas RFs, we found that the XGBoost model
estimated the RF for the train and test datasets more accurately than the SVM

for the independent databases. Results demonstrated that the ML algorithms were
highly dependent and sensitive to the databases based on which they were
trained. Statistical tests revealed that such unsatisfactory performances were
because the distributions of input features and target variables in the train
datasets were significantly different from those in the independent databases
(p-value < 0.05).

Our main result is an efficient Fourier Interpolation algorithm that improves
the previous best algorithm by [Chen, Kane, Price, and Song, FOCS 2016] in the
following three aspects:
  $\bullet$ The sample complexity is improved from $\widetilde{O}(k^{51})$ to
$\widetilde{O}(k^{4})$.
  $\bullet$ The time complexity is improved from $
\widetilde{O}(k^{10\omega+40})$ to $\widetilde{O}(k^{4 \omega})$.
  $\bullet$ The output sparsity is improved from $\widetilde{O}(k^{10})$ to

  Here, $\omega$ denotes the exponent of fast matrix multiplication. The
state-of-the-art sample complexity of this problem is $\sim k^4$, but was only
known to be achieved by an *exponential-time* algorithm. Our algorithm uses the

an efficient Fourier Interpolation algorithm.
  The centerpiece of our algorithm is a new sufficient condition for the
frequency estimation task -- a high signal-to-noise (SNR) band condition --
which allows for efficient and accurate signal reconstruction. Based on this
condition together with a new structural decomposition of Fourier signals
(Signal Equivalent Method), we design a cheap algorithm for estimating each

signal estimation algorithm into a new Fourier Interpolation framework to
reconstruct the ground-truth signal.

quality to be used to potentially derive distances using the Tully-Fisher

is sufficiently close to edge-on. For these, we derive Tully-Fisher distances
using the deprojected WALLABY velocity widths combined with infrared (WISE W1)
magnitudes. The resulting Tully-Fisher distances for the Eridanus, Hydra, Norma

admit estimates for the series remainders which are independent of the real
part of the square root of the spectral parameter. This feature makes them
especially useful for solving direct and inverse spectral problems requiring
calculation of solutions on large intervals in the spectral parameter.
Moreover, the first coefficient of the representation is sufficient for the

wettability on the dynamics of the interface between an invading and a

a hybrid phase field-immersed boundary approach to successfully model the
contact line dynamics over the solid objects. We map the three dominant modes
governing the motion of the interface, namely, viscous fingering, capillary
fingering, and stable penetration, in the ($Ca$-$\theta$) plane, with $\theta$
the static contact angle prescribed at the solid pores. Viscous fingering is
dominant at larger capillary numbers irrespective of the contact angle.
Capillary fingering dominates at lower values of $Ca$ and pores hydrophobic to
the invading phase, while stable penetration is observed on hydrophillic
surfaces. We also show that the pressure needed for the invading phase to
advance at constant flow rate decreases with the capillary number, and
increases with the contact angle at the lowest capillary numbers considered.
The latter is due to a significant increase of the length of the interface in
the case of capillary fingering. Finally, we show that it is possible to
identify the different interfacial modes by measuring the penetration length
and velocity during the medium filling.

based on applying a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to learn how to
effectively parse the shape using a trial-and-error scheme relying on scalar

approximated as a polygon mesh. The agent aims to maximize the reward that
depends on the accuracy of surface reconstruction for the approximated parts.
We also consider pre-training of the network for faster learning using
demonstrations generated by a heuristic approach. Experiments show that our
training algorithm which benefits from both imitation learning and also self
exploration, learns efficient policies faster, which results the agent to
produce visually compelling results.

end, we introduce Dialogue On the ROad To Handle Irregular Events (DOROTHIE), a
novel interactive simulation platform that enables the creation of unexpected

Dialogue Navigation (SDN), a navigation benchmark of 183 trials with a total of
8415 utterances, around 18.7 hours of control streams, and 2.9 hours of trimmed

moves from humans as well as generate its own dialogue moves and physical
navigation actions. We further developed a transformer-based baseline model for
these SDN tasks. Our empirical results indicate that language guided-navigation
in a highly dynamic environment is an extremely difficult task for end-to-end

exceptional mechanical properties, that have been suggested to be linked to

treatments, such as annealing or/and aging. Here, we use hybrid Monte
Carlo-Molecular Dynamics simulations to gain further insights of thermal
effects on the SRO formation as well as the edge dislocation plasticity
mechanisms of equiatomic NiCoCr face-centered cubic solid solution. For that
purpose, we utilize two well-known NiCoCr interatomic potentials, one of which
displays well documented SRO, believed to be linked to experimental evidence
and labeled as the Li-Sheng-Ma potential, while the other (Farkas-Caro) does
not. We use these two potentials to discern short range ordering (from inherent
randomness in random solid solutions) and understand how SROs influence
dislocation depinning dynamics in various thermal annealing scenarios. In this
context, we used robust, scale-dependent metrics to infer a characteristic SRO
size in the Li-Sheng-Ma case by probing local concentration fluctuations which
otherwise indicate uncorrelated patterns in the Farkas-Caro case in a close
agreement with random alloys. Using relevant order parameters, we also report
on the drastic increase of chemical ordering within the stacking fault region.
More importantly, we find that the Li-Sheng-Ma potential leads to excellent
edge dislocation depinning strength with low stacking fault width. Our findings
indicate an enhanced roughening mechanism due to the SROs-misfit synergy that
leads to significant improvements in dislocation glide resistance. We argue
that the improvements in alloy strength have their atomistic origins in the
interplay between nanoscopic SROs and atomic-level misfit properties.

the mapping of the resulting SRT modes to corresponding velocity fields, which
enables a complete dissipation-optimized reconstruction of the velocity field.
Flow data snapshots are obtained from a direct numerical simulation of a
turbulent channel flow with friction Reynolds number $Re_{\tau}=390$. The
lowest dissipation-optimized POD (d-POD) modes are compared to the lowest
conventional turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) optimized POD (e-POD) modes. The
lowest d-POD modes show a richer small-scale structure, along with traces of
the large-scale structure characteristic of e-POD modes, indicating that the
former capture structures across a wider range of spatial scales. Profiles of
both TKE and dissipation are reconstructed using both decompositions, and
reconstruction convergences are compared in all cases. Both TKE and dissipation
are reconstructed more efficiently in the dissipation-rich near-wall region
using d-POD modes, and in the TKE-rich bulk using e-POD modes. Lower modes of
either decomposition tend to contribute more to either reconstructed quantity.
Separating each term into eigenvalues and factors relating to the inherent
structures in each mode reveals that higher e-POD modes tend to encode more
dissipative structures, whereas the structures encoded by d-POD modes have
roughly constant inherent TKE content, supporting the hypothesis that
structures encoded by d-POD modes tend to span a wide range of spatial scales.

direct numerical simulations and analysis of the underlying dynamical processes

linearly unstable and breaks down into turbulence. We observe that this
precession-driven turbulence is in general characterized by coexisting two
dimensional (2D) columnar vortices and three dimensional (3D) inertial waves,
whose relative energies depend on the precession parameter $Po$. The vortices
resemble the typical condensates of geostrophic turbulence, are aligned along
the rotation axis (with zero wavenumber in this direction, $k_z=0$) and are fed
by the 3D waves through nonlinear transfer of energy, while the waves (with
$k_z\neq0$) in turn are directly fed by the precessional instability of the
background flow. The vortices themselves undergo inverse cascade of energy and
exhibit anisotropy in Fourier space. For small $Po<0.1$ and sufficiently high
Reynolds numbers, the typical regime for most geo- and astrophysical
applications, the flow exhibits strongly oscillatory (bursty) evolution due to
the alternation of vortices and small-scale waves. On the other hand, at larger
$Po>0.1$ turbulence is quasi-steady with only mild fluctuations, the coexisting
columnar vortices and waves in this state give rise to a split (simultaneous
inverse and forward) cascade. Increasing the precession magnitude causes a
reinforcement of waves relative to vortices with the energy spectrum
approaching Kolmogorov scaling and, therefore, the precession mechanism
counteracts the effects of the rotation.

  Optimization Problems",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Optimization problems with expensive nonlinear cost functions and
combinatorial constraints appear in many real-world applications, but remain
challenging to solve efficiently. Existing combinatorial solvers like Mixed
Integer Linear Programming can be fast in practice but cannot readily optimize
nonlinear cost functions, while general nonlinear optimizers like gradient
descent often do not handle complex combinatorial structures, may require many
queries of the cost function, and are prone to local optima. To bridge this
gap, we propose SurCo that learns linear Surrogate costs which can be used by
existing Combinatorial solvers to output good solutions to the original
nonlinear combinatorial optimization problem, combining the flexibility of
gradient-based methods with the structure of linear combinatorial optimization.
We learn these linear surrogates end-to-end with the nonlinear loss by
differentiating through the linear surrogate solver. Three variants of SurCo
are proposed: SurCo-zero operates on individual nonlinear problems, SurCo-prior
trains a linear surrogate predictor on distributions of problems, and
SurCo-hybrid uses a model trained offline to warm start online solving for
SurCo-zero. We analyze our method theoretically and empirically, showing smooth
convergence and improved performance. Experiments show that compared to
state-of-the-art approaches and expert-designed heuristics, SurCo obtains lower
cost solutions with comparable or faster solve time for two realworld
industry-level applications: embedding table sharding and inverse photonic

images with rich and complementary information for routine clinical use;
however, it suffers from a long acquisition time. Recent works for accelerating
MRI, mainly designed for single contrast, may not be optimal for multi-contrast
scenario since the inherent correlations among the multi-contrast images are
not exploited. In addition, independent reconstruction of each contrast usually
does not translate to optimal performance of downstream tasks. Motivated by
these aspects, in this paper we design an end-to-end framework for accelerating
multi-contrast MRI which simultaneously optimizes the entire MR imaging
workflow including sampling, reconstruction and downstream tasks to achieve the
best overall outcomes. The proposed framework consists of a sampling mask
generator for each image contrast and a reconstructor exploiting the
inter-contrast correlations with a recurrent structure which enables the
information sharing in a holistic way. The sampling mask generator and the
reconstructor are trained jointly across the multiple image contrasts. The
acceleration ratio of each image contrast is also learnable and can be driven
by a downstream task performance. We validate our approach on a multi-contrast
brain dataset and a multi-contrast knee dataset. Experiments show that (1) our
framework consistently outperforms the baselines designed for single contrast
on both datasets; (2) our newly designed recurrent reconstruction network
effectively improves the reconstruction quality for multi-contrast images; (3)
the learnable acceleration ratio improves the downstream task performance
significantly. Overall, this work has potentials to open up new avenues for
optimizing the entire multi-contrast MR imaging workflow.

variable to assess how information affects one's own actions. However, beliefs

experimenters map subjects' true belief distributions to what profit-maximizing
subjects respond in the elicitation task. In particular, we show how slightly
different incentives may induce subjects to report the mean, mode, or median of
their belief distribution. If beliefs are not symmetric and unimodal, then
using an elicitation scheme that is mismatched with the research question may
affect both the magnitude and the sign of identified effects, or may even make
identification impossible. As an example, we revisit Cantoni et al.'s (2019)

We show that they elicit modal beliefs, while modal and mean beliefs may be
updated in opposite directions following their experiment. Hence, the sign of
their effects may change, allowing an alternative interpretation of their

representation of full order models (FOMs), typically obtained through the
discretization of certain partial differential equations (PDEs) using
conventional techniques where the discretization may contain a very large
number of degrees of freedom. As a result of this more compact representation,
the resulting projection-based reduced order models (ROMs) can achieve
considerable computational speedups, which are especially useful in real-time
or multi-query analyses. One known deficiency of projection-based ROMs is that
they can suffer from a lack of robustness, stability and accuracy, especially
in the predictive regime, which ultimately limits their useful application.
Another research gap that has prevented the widespread adoption of ROMs within
the modeling and simulation community is the lack of theoretical and
algorithmic foundations necessary for the ""plug-and-play"" integration of these
models into existing multi-scale and multi-physics frameworks. This paper
describes a new methodology that has the potential to address both of the
aforementioned deficiencies by coupling projection-based ROMs with each other
as well as with conventional FOMs by means of the Schwarz alternating method.
Leveraging recent work that adapted the Schwarz alternating method to enable
consistent and concurrent multi-scale coupling of finite element FOMs in solid
mechanics, we present a new extension of the Schwarz formulation that enables
ROM-FOM and ROM-ROM coupling in nonlinear solid mechanics. In order to maintain
efficiency, we employ hyper-reduction via the Energy-Conserving Sampling and
Weighting approach. We evaluate the proposed coupling approach in the
reproductive as well as in the predictive regime on a canonical test case that
involves the dynamic propagation of a traveling wave in a nonlinear
hyper-elastic material.

velocimetry measurements based on laser-based interferometric techniques. This
study presents an experimental methodology to measure the free surface
full-field particle velocity in shock compression experiments using high-speed
imaging and three-dimensional (3D) digital image correlation (DIC). The
experimental setup has a temporal resolution of 100 ns with a spatial
resolution varying from 90 to 200 $\mu$m/pixel. Experiments were conducted
under three different plate impact configurations to measure spatially resolved
free surface velocity and validate the experimental technique. First, a normal
impact experiment was conducted on polycarbonate to measure the macroscopic
full-field normal free surface velocity. Second, an isentropic compression
experiment on Y-cut quartz-tungsten carbide assembly is performed to measure
the particle velocity for experiments involving ramp compression waves. To
explore the capability of the technique in multi-axial loading conditions, a
pressure shear plate impact experiment was conducted to measure both the normal
and transverse free surface velocities under combined normal and shear loading.
The velocities measured in the experiments using digital image correlation are
validated against previous data obtained from laser interferometry. Numerical
simulations were also performed using established material models to compare
and validate the experimental velocity profiles for these different impact
configurations. The novel ability of the employed experimental setup to measure
full-field free surface velocities with high spatial resolutions in shock
compression experiments is demonstrated for the first time in this work.

transparent models and decisions, which are easy to understand, analyze, and

provide an explainable framework, while also modeling uncertainties present in
real-world environments, which renders it suitable for applications where
explainability is a requirement. However, most real-life processes are not
characterized by high levels of uncertainties alone; they are inherently
time-dependent as well, i.e., the processes change with time. In this work, we
present novel Temporal Type-2 FLS Based Approach for time-dependent XAI (TXAI)
systems, which can account for the likelihood of a measurement's occurrence in
the time domain using (the measurement's) frequency of occurrence. In Temporal
Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (TT2FSs), a four-dimensional (4D) time-dependent membership
function is developed where relations are used to construct the inter-relations
between the elements of the universe of discourse and its frequency of
occurrence. The TXAI system manifested better classification prowess, with
10-fold test datasets, with a mean recall of 95.40\% than a standard XAI system
(based on non-temporal general type-2 (GT2) fuzzy sets) that had a mean recall
of 87.04\%. TXAI also performed significantly better than most non-explainable
AI systems between 3.95\%, to 19.04\% improvement gain in mean recall. In
addition, TXAI can also outline the most likely time-dependent trajectories
using the frequency of occurrence values embedded in the TXAI model; viz. given
a rule at a determined time interval, what will be the next most likely rule at
a subsequent time interval. In this regard, the proposed TXAI system can have
profound implications for delineating the evolution of real-life time-dependent
processes, such as behavioural or biological processes.

trained with APE over-rely on positional information to the point that they
break-down when subjected to sentences with shifted position information.
Specifically, when models are subjected to sentences starting from a non-zero
position (excluding the effect of priming), they exhibit noticeably degraded
performance on zero to full-shot tasks, across a range of model families and

many problems in NLP. When the similarity is measured by dot-product between
dual-encoder vectors or $\ell_2$-distance, there already exist many scalable
and efficient search methods. But not so when similarity is measured by more
accurate and expensive black-box neural similarity models, such as
cross-encoders, which jointly encode the query and candidate neighbor. The
cross-encoders' high computational cost typically limits their use to reranking
candidates retrieved by a cheaper model, such as dual encoder or TF-IDF.
However, the accuracy of such a two-stage approach is upper-bounded by the
recall of the initial candidate set, and potentially requires additional
training to align the auxiliary retrieval model with the cross-encoder model.
In this paper, we present an approach that avoids the use of a dual-encoder for
retrieval, relying solely on the cross-encoder. Retrieval is made efficient
with CUR decomposition, a matrix decomposition approach that approximates all
pairwise cross-encoder distances from a small subset of rows and columns of the
distance matrix. Indexing items using our approach is computationally cheaper
than training an auxiliary dual-encoder model through distillation.
Empirically, for k > 10, our approach provides test-time
recall-vs-computational cost trade-offs superior to the current widely-used
methods that re-rank items retrieved using a dual-encoder or TF-IDF.

economist W. B. Arthur in the '80s to explain the lock-in phenomenon between
two competing commercial products. In the most simplified situation there are
two competing products that gain customers according to a majority mechanism:
each new customer arrives and asks which product they bought to a certain odd
number of previous customers, and then buy the most shared product within this
sample. It is known that one of these two companies reaches monopoly almost
surely in the limit of infinite customers. Here we consider a generalization
[G. Dosi, Y. Ermoliev, Y. Kaniovsky, J. Math. Econom. 23, 1-19 (1994)] where
the new customer follows the indication of the sample with some probability,
and buy the other product otherwise. Other than economy, this model can be
reduced to the urn of Hill, Lane and Sudderth, and includes several models of
physical interest as special cases, like the Elephant Random Walk, the
Friedman's urn and other generalized urn models. We provide a large deviation
analysis of this model at the sample-path level, and give a formula that allows
to find the most likely trajectories followed by the market share variable.
Interestingly, in the parameter range where the lock-in phase is expected, we
observe a whole region of convergence where the entropy cost is sub-linear. We
also find a non-linear differential equation for the cumulant generating
function of the market share variable, that can be studied with a suitable
perturbations theory.

  transfer method for few-shot prompt tuning",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Prompt tuning approaches, which learn task-specific soft prompts for a
downstream task conditioning on frozen pre-trained models, have attracted
growing interest due to its parameter efficiency. With large language models
and sufficient training data, prompt tuning performs comparably to full-model
tuning. However, with limited training samples in few-shot settings, prompt
tuning fails to match the performance of full-model fine-tuning. In this work,
we focus on improving the few-shot performance of prompt tuning by transferring
knowledge from soft prompts of source tasks. Recognizing the good
generalization capabilities of ensemble methods in low-data regime, we first
experiment and show that a simple ensemble of model predictions based on
different source prompts, outperforms existing multi-prompt knowledge transfer
approaches such as source prompt fusion in the few-shot setting. Motivated by
this observation, we further investigate model ensembles and propose
Sample-specific Ensemble of Source Models (SESoM). SESoM learns to adjust the
contribution of each source model for each target sample separately when
ensembling source model outputs. Through this way, SESoM inherits the superior
generalization of model ensemble approaches and simultaneously captures the
sample-specific competence of each source prompt. We conduct experiments across
a diverse set of eight NLP tasks using models of different scales (T5-{base,
large, XL}) and find that SESoM consistently outperforms the existing models of
the same as well as larger parametric scale by a large margin.

worldwide energy consumption. Improving the energy efficiency of the building
sector can help reduce the operation cost and reduce the greenhouse gas
emission. The energy management system (EMS) can monitor and control the
operations of built-in appliances in buildings, so an efficient EMS is of
crucial importance to improve the building operation efficiency and maintain
safe operations. With the growing penetration of renewable energy and
electrical appliances, increasing attention has been paid to the development of
intelligent building EMS. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been
applied for building EMS and has shown promising potential. However, most of
the current RL-based EMS solutions would need a large amount of data to learn a
reliable control policy, which limits the applicability of these solutions in
the real world. In this work, we propose MetaEMS, which can help achieve better
energy management performance with the benefits of RL and meta-learning.
Experiment results showcase that our proposed MetaEMS can adapt faster to

volume recovery problem for a continuous phase object like RBC, we came across
an interesting feature of the back-propagated field that it does not show clear
focusing effect. Therefore the sparsity enforcement within the iterative
optimization framework given the single hologram data cannot effectively
restrict the true object volume. For phase objects, it is known that the
amplitude contrast of the back-propagated object field at the focus plane is
minimum and it increases at the defocus planes. We therefore use this

function of inverse of amplitude contrast. This weight function is employed in
the iterative steps of the optimization algorithm to assist the object volume
localization. The experimental illustrations of 3D volume reconstruction of the

Gaussian noise, being solely applicable to linear in the parameters (LIP)
systems, and having persisting excitation requirements (PE). A variable jump
distribution based on a temporal forgetting factor (TFF) is proposed in ARMCMC.
The TFF can be utilized in many dynamical systems as an effective way to
adaptively present the forgetting factor instead of a constant hyperparameter.
The particular jump distribution has tailored towards hybrid/multi-modal
systems that enables inferences among modes by providing a trade-off between
exploitation and exploration. These trade-off are adjusted based on parameter
evolution rate. In comparison to traditional MCMC techniques, we show that
ARMCMC requires fewer samples to obtain the same accuracy and reliability. We
show our method on two challenging benchmarks: parameter estimation in a soft

the changes in an object's size over time together with the camera's motion to
estimate the object's distance. Since DMODE is class agnostic method, it is
easily adaptable to new environments. Therefore, it is able to maintain
performance across different object detectors, and be easily adapted to new
object classes. We tested our model across different scenarios of training and
testing on the KITTI MOTS dataset's ground-truth bounding box annotations, and
bounding box outputs of TrackRCNN and EagerMOT. The instantaneous change of
bounding box sizes and camera position are then used to obtain an object's

a suppression of the cross section due to the energy loss experienced by a

graph-related tasks. However, recent studies have shown that many GNNs are
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In a vast majority of existing studies,
adversarial attacks on GNNs are launched via direct modification of the
original graph such as adding/removing links, which may not be applicable in
practice. In this paper, we focus on a realistic attack operation via injecting
fake nodes. The proposed Global Attack strategy via Node Injection (GANI) is
designed under the comprehensive consideration of an unnoticeable perturbation
setting from both structure and feature domains. Specifically, to make the node
injections as imperceptible and effective as possible, we propose a sampling
operation to determine the degree of the newly injected nodes, and then
generate features and select neighbors for these injected nodes based on the
statistical information of features and evolutionary perturbations obtained
from a genetic algorithm, respectively. In particular, the proposed feature
generation mechanism is suitable for both binary and continuous node features.
Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets against both general and
defended GNNs show strong attack performance of GANI. Moreover, the
imperceptibility analyses also demonstrate that GANI achieves a relatively
unnoticeable injection on benchmark datasets.

pretrained LMs. In this work, we present compositional fine-tuning (CFT): an
approach based on explicitly decomposing a target task into component tasks,
and then fine-tuning smaller LMs on a curriculum of such component tasks. We
apply CFT to recommendation tasks in two domains, world travel and local
dining, as well as a previously studied inferential task (sports
understanding). We show that CFT outperforms end-to-end learning even with
equal amounts of data, and gets consistently better as more component tasks are
modeled via fine-tuning. Compared with chain of thought prompting, CFT performs
at least as well using LMs only 7.4% of the size, and is moreover applicable to
task domains for which data are not available during pretraining.

While conceptually interesting, these charge transfer excitons are highly

making mixed dimensional vdWHs (MDHs) where one of the components is a
spatially quantum confined medium. Here, we demonstrate the formation of CT
excitons in a 2D/quasi-2D system comprising MoSe2 and WSe2 monolayers and
CdSe/CdS based core/shell nanoplates (NPLs). Spectral signatures of CT excitons
in our MDHs were resolved locally at the 2D/single-NPL heterointerface using
tip-enhanced photoluminescence (TEPL) at room temperature. By varying both the
2D material, the shell thickness of the NPLs, and applying out-of-plane
electric field, the exciton resonance energy was tuned by up to 120 meV. Our
finding is a significant step towards the realization of highly tunable
MDH-based next generation photonic devices.

inter-organizational collaboration. The proposed method uses blockchain to
secure the privacy of the data. Smart contract deployed inside the network
fully automates the system. An ML model is incrementally upgraded from
collaborative data provided by the organizations connected to the blockchain.
To incentivize the organizations, we have introduced an incentive mechanism
that is adaptive to the difficulty level in updating a model. The organizations
receive incentives based on the difficulty faced in updating the ML model. A
mining criterion has been proposed to mine the block efficiently. And finally,
the blockchain network istested under different difficulty levels and under
different volumes of data to test its efficiency. The model achieved 98.93%
testing accuracy and 98.22% Fbeta score (recall-biased f measure) over eight
incremental updates. Our experiment shows that both data volume and difficulty
level of blockchain impacts the mining time. For difficulty level less than
five, mining time and difficulty level has a positive correlation. For
difficulty level two and three, less than a second is required to mine a block

framework, followed by SNN training}. In particular, we propose novel
activation functions in the source LSTM architecture and judiciously select a

optimal bias shifts. Additionally, we derive the leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF)
activation functions converted from their non-spiking LSTM counterparts which
justifies the need to jointly optimize the weights, threshold, and leak

the SNN time steps, significantly improving system latency, especially for long

accumulate operations (AC), in contrast to expensive multiply-and-accumulates
(MAC) needed for ANNs, except for the input layer when using direct encoding,
yielding significant improvements in energy efficiency. We evaluate our
framework on sequential learning tasks including temporal MNIST, Google Speech

obtain test accuracy of 94.75% with only 2 time steps with direct encoding on

is critical but extremely challenging, as the quenched interaction randomness
introduced by structural imperfection is usually inevitable in real materials.
YCu$_3$(OH)$_{6.5}$Br$_{2.5}$ (YCOB) is a spin-1/2 kagome Heisenberg
antiferromagnet (KHA) with strong coupling of $\langle J_1\rangle\sim$ 51 K but
without conventional magnetic freezing down to 50 mK $\sim$ 0.001$\langle
J_1\rangle$. Here, we report a Br nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of the
local spin susceptibility and dynamics on the single crystal of YCOB. The
temperature dependence of NMR main-line shifts and broadening can be well
understood within the frame of the KHA model with randomly distributed hexagons
of alternate exchanges, compatible with the formation of a randomness-induced
QSL state at low temperatures. The in-plane spin fluctuations as measured by
the spin-lattice relaxation rates ($1/T_1$) exhibit a weak temperature
dependence down to $T$ $\sim$ 0.03$\langle J_1\rangle$. Our results demonstrate
that the majority of spins remain highly fluctuating at low temperatures
despite the quenched disorder in YCOB.

impossible to achieve in practice. Recently, Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) has
attracted considerable attention due to the significant performance improvement
in various challenging domains. However, the expensive time cost during search
severely restricts its scope for applications. This paper proposes the Virtual
MCTS (V-MCTS), a variant of MCTS that spends more search time on harder states
and less search time on simpler states adaptively. We give theoretical bounds
of the proposed method and evaluate the performance and computations on $9
\times 9$ Go board games and Atari games. Experiments show that our method can
achieve comparable performances to the original search algorithm while
requiring less than $50\%$ search time on average. We believe that this

multiple-output (MIMO) networks is providing backhaul links for a large number

Wireless backhauling can be a promising solution that can be integrated with
wireless access links to increase spectrum efficiency. In this paper, the
application of integrated access and backhaul (IAB) technique in
millimeter-wave (mmWave) CF massive MIMO systems is investigated. The access
and backhaul links share a frequency spectrum in the mmWave bands, and in both,
hybrid beamforming techniques are adopted for signal transmission. The
bandwidth allocation (division) parameter between the two link types as well as
the beamforming matrices are optimized to maximize the end-to-end data-rate.
This leads to a non-convex optimization problem for which an efficient solution
method is proposed. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the IAB

also compare the proposed hybrid beamforming method with a fully digital

data (RSVG). RSVG aims to localize the referred objects in remote sensing (RS)
images with the guidance of natural language. To retrieve rich information from
RS imagery using natural language, many research tasks, like RS image visual
question answering, RS image captioning, and RS image-text retrieval have been
investigated a lot. However, the object-level visual grounding on RS images is
still under-explored. Thus, in this work, we propose to construct the dataset
and explore deep learning models for the RSVG task. Specifically, our
contributions can be summarized as follows. 1) We build the new large-scale
benchmark dataset of RSVG, termed RSVGD, to fully advance the research of RSVG.
This new dataset includes image/expression/box triplets for training and
evaluating visual grounding models. 2) We benchmark extensive state-of-the-art
(SOTA) natural image visual grounding methods on the constructed RSVGD dataset,
and some insightful analyses are provided based on the results. 3) A novel
transformer-based Multi-Level Cross-Modal feature learning (MLCM) module is
proposed. Remotely-sensed images are usually with large scale variations and
cluttered backgrounds. To deal with the scale-variation problem, the MLCM
module takes advantage of multi-scale visual features and multi-granularity
textual embeddings to learn more discriminative representations. To cope with
the cluttered background problem, MLCM adaptively filters irrelevant noise and
enhances salient features. In this way, our proposed model can incorporate more
effective multi-level and multi-modal features to boost performance.
Furthermore, this work also provides useful insights for developing better RSVG
models. The dataset and code will be publicly available at

both the filterbank and the self-supervised embeddings preserve the integrity

to LRMVC having insufficient access to global information, which is contrary to
the target of multi-view clustering. To alleviate these problems, we propose a
new tensor decomposition called Tucker-O-Minus Decomposition (TOMD) for
multi-view clustering. Specifically, based on the Tucker format, we
additionally employ the O-minus structure, which consists of a circle with an
efficient bridge linking two weekly correlated factors. In this way, the core
tensor in Tucker format is replaced by the O-minus architecture with a more
balanced structure, and the enhanced capacity of capturing the global low rank

simultaneously. The alternating direction method of multipliers is used to
solve the proposed model TOMD-MVC. Numerical experiments on six benchmark data

4.90 micron absorption band of OCS ice is detected in 20 sight-lines, more than
five times the previously known detections. The absorption profile shows little
variation and is consistent with OCS being embedded in CH3OH-rich ices, or
proton-irradiated H$_2$S or SO$_2$-containing ices. The OCS column densities
correlate well with those of CH$_3$OH and OCN$^-$, but not with H$_2$O and
apolar CO ice. This association of OCS with CH$_3$OH and OCN$^-$ firmly
establishes their formation location deep inside dense clouds or protostellar
envelopes. The median composition of this ice phase towards massive YSOs, as a
percentage of H$_2$O, is CO:CH$_3$OH:OCN$^-$:OCS=24:20:1.53:0.15. CS, due to
its low abundance, is likely not the main precursor to OCS. Sulfurization of CO
is likely needed, although the source of this sulfur is not well constrained.
Compared to massive YSOs, low mass YSOs and dense clouds have similar CO and
CH$_3$OH ice abundances, but less OCN$^-$ and more apolar CO, while OCS awaits
detection. Comets tend to be under-abundant in carbon-bearing species, but this
does not appear to be the case for OCS, perhaps signalling OCS production in

strategies to help people relieve emotional distress and overcome the problem
they face, which has attracted much attention in these years. However, most
state-of-the-art works rely heavily on external commonsense knowledge to infer
the mental state of the user in every dialogue round. Although effective, they
may suffer from significant human effort, knowledge update and domain change in
a long run. Therefore, in this article, we focus on exploring the task itself
without using any external knowledge. We find all existing works ignore two
significant characteristics of ESC. (a) Abundant prior knowledge exists in
historical conversations, such as the responses to similar cases and the
general order of support strategies, which has a great reference value for
current conversation. (b) There is a one-to-many mapping relationship between
context and support strategy, i.e.multiple strategies are reasonable for a
single context. It lays a better foundation for the diversity of generations.
Taking into account these two key factors, we propose Prior Knowledge Enhanced
emotional support model with latent variable, PoKE. The proposed model fully
taps the potential of prior knowledge in terms of exemplars and strategy
sequence and then utilizes a latent variable to model the one-to-many
relationship of strategy. Furthermore, we introduce a memory schema to
incorporate the encoded knowledge into decoder. Experiment results on benchmark
dataset show that our PoKE outperforms existing baselines on both automatic
evaluation and human evaluation. Compared with the model using external
knowledge, PoKE still can make a slight improvement in some metrics. Further
experiments prove that abundant prior knowledge is conducive to high-quality
emotional support, and a well-learned latent variable is critical to the
diversity of generations.

objective function is smoothed and the dimension of the variable is raised to
facilitate calculation. Then an untrained generative network is embedded in the
iterative process of ADMM to project an estimated signal into the generative
space, and the projected signal is applied to next iteration of ADMM. We
theoretically analyzed the two projections included in the algorithm, one makes
the objective function descent, and the other gets the estimation closer to the
optimal solution. Numerical experiments show that the reconstruction
performance and robustness of the proposed algorithm are superior to prior
works, especially when the sampling rates are low.

communications, cryptography, and compressed sensing. In the literature, many
efforts have been made to construct good sequences with various lengths where
binary sequences attracts great attention. As a result, various constructions
of good binary sequences have been proposed. However, most of the known
constructions made use of the multiplicative cyclic group structure of finite
field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ for a prime $p$ and a positive integer $n$. In fact,
all $p^n+1$ rational places including the place at infinity of the rational
function field over $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ form a cyclic structure under an
automorphism of order $p^n+1$. In this paper, we make use of this cyclic
structure to provide an explicit construction of binary sequences with a low
correlation of length $p^n+1$ via cyclotomic function fields over
$\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ for any odd prime $p$. Each family of binary sequences has
size $p^n-2$ and its correlation is upper bounded by $4+\lfloor 2\cdot
p^{n/2}\rfloor$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction
of binary sequences with a low correlation of length $p^n+1$ for odd prime $p$.
Moreover, our sequences can be constructed explicitly and have competitive
parameters.

  Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.LG physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are emerging as popular mesh-free
solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs). Recent extensions decompose
the domain, applying different PINNs to solve the equation in each subdomain
and aligning the solution at the interface of the subdomains. Hence, they can
further alleviate the problem complexity, reduce the computational cost, and
allow parallelization. However, the performance of the multi-domain PINNs is
sensitive to the choice of the interface conditions for solution alignment.
While quite a few conditions have been proposed, there is no suggestion about
how to select the conditions according to specific problems. To address this
gap, we propose META Learning of Interface Conditions (METALIC), a simple,
efficient yet powerful approach to dynamically determine the optimal interface
conditions for solving a family of parametric PDEs. Specifically, we develop
two contextual multi-arm bandit models. The first one applies to the entire
training procedure, and online updates a Gaussian process (GP) reward surrogate
that given the PDE parameters and interface conditions predicts the solution
error. The second one partitions the training into two stages, one is the
stochastic phase and the other deterministic phase; we update a GP surrogate
for each phase to enable different condition selections at the two stages so as
to further bolster the flexibility and performance. We have shown the advantage
of METALIC on four bench-mark PDE families.

the COVID-19 pandemic exhibit reversible changes -- in many regions, the
mobility first decreased significantly and later restored. Based on this
observation, here we study the classical SIR model on a particular type of
time-varying network where the links undergo a freeze-recovery process. We
first focus on an isolated network and find that the recovery mechanism could
lead to the resurgence of an epidemic. The influence of link freezing on
epidemic dynamics is subtle. In particular, we show that there is an optimal
value of the freezing rate for links which corresponds to the lowest prevalence
of the epidemic. This result challenges our conventional idea that stricter
prevention measures (corresponding to a larger freezing rate) could always have
a better inhibitory effect on epidemic spreading. We further investigate an
open system where a small fraction of nodes in the network may acquire the
disease from the ""environment"" (the outside infected nodes). In this case, the
second wave would appear even if the number of infected nodes has declined to
zero, which can not be explained by the isolated network model.

the redshift evolution of the anisotropic clustering in redshift space to
calibrate cosmology. It extends the applicable range of AP method to
substantially nonlinear scales, yielding very tight cosmological constraints.
For future stage-IV slitless spectroscopic surveys, the non-negligible redshift
errors might reduce the advantage of the tomographic AP method by suppressing
the resolution of the nonlinear structure along the line of sight. The present
work studies how redshift errors propagate to cosmological parameters in the
tomographic AP analysis. We use a formula $\sigma_z = \sigma(1+z)^{\alpha} $ to
model the redshift errors, with $\sigma$ varying from 0.001 to 0.006 and
$\alpha$ varying from 0.5 to 1.5. The redshift errors produce a signal of
anisotropic clustering that is similar to a strong finger-of-god effect, which
smears out both the AP signal and the contamination caused by the redshift
space distortions (RSD). For the target precision of the Chinese Space Station
Telescope optical survey ($\sigma\lesssim 0.002$), the decrement of
constraining power on the dark energy equation of state is mild ($\lesssim
50\%$), and the suppression of RSD contamination leads to a smaller
bias-to-signal ratio. Our results indicate that the tomographic AP method will
remain a useful and complementary tool for analyses of future slitless
spectroscopic surveys.

relationships between the near-infrared continuum extinction (AK) and the
depths of the 9.7 micron silicate (tau97) and 3.0 micron H2O ice (tau30)

AK~1.2 (AV~10; Perseus, Lupus, dense cores) and ~2.0 (AV~17; Serpens), the
tau97/AK ratio is lowest. The tau97/AK reduction from diffuse to dense clouds
is consistent with a moderate degree of grain growth (sizes up to ~0.5 micron),
increasing the near-infrared color excess (and thus AK), but not affecting ice
and silicate band profiles. This grain growth process seems to be related to
the ice column densities and dense core formation thresholds, highlighting the
importance of density. After correction for Serpens foreground extinction, the
H2O ice formation threshold is in the range of AK=0.31-0.40 (AV=2.6-3.4) for
all clouds, and thus grain growth takes place after the ices are formed.
Finally, abundant CH3OH ice (~21% relative to H2O) is reported for
2MASSJ18285266+0028242 (Serpens), a factor of >4 larger than for the other

to executable SQL queries. In practice, text-to-SQL parsers often encounter
various challenging scenarios, requiring them to be generalizable and robust.
While most existing work addresses a particular generalization or robustness
challenge, we aim to study it in a more comprehensive manner. In specific, we
believe that text-to-SQL parsers should be (1) generalizable at three levels of
generalization, namely i.i.d., zero-shot, and compositional, and (2) robust
against input perturbations. To enhance these capabilities of the parser, we
propose a novel TKK framework consisting of Task decomposition, Knowledge
acquisition, and Knowledge composition to learn text-to-SQL parsing in stages.
By dividing the learning process into multiple stages, our framework improves
the parser's ability to acquire general SQL knowledge instead of capturing
spurious patterns, making it more generalizable and robust. Experimental
results under various generalization and robustness settings show that our
framework is effective in all scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Spider, SParC, and CoSQL datasets. Code can be found at

feelings and emotions. In daily conversation, according to the psychologist,
only 7% and 38% of information is communicated through words and sounds
respective, while up to 55% is through facial expression. It plays an important
role in coordinating interpersonal relationships. Ekman and Friesen recognized
six essential emotions in the nineteenth century depending on a cross-cultural
study, which indicated that people feel each basic emotion in the same fashion
despite culture. As a branch of the field of analyzing sentiment, facial
expression recognition offers broad application prospects in a variety of
domains, including the interaction between humans and computers, healthcare,
and behavior monitoring. Therefore, many researchers have devoted themselves to
facial expression recognition. In this paper, an effective hybrid data
augmentation method is used. This approach is operated on two public datasets,
and four benchmark models see some remarkable results.

structure changes over time. Compared with methods on static networks, temporal
network embedding (TNE) methods are facing three challenges: 1) it cannot
describe the temporal dependence across network snapshots; 2) the node
embedding in the latent space fails to indicate changes in the network
topology; and 3) it cannot avoid a lot of redundant computation via parameter
inheritance on a series of snapshots. To this end, we propose a novel temporal
network embedding method named Dynamic Cluster Structure Constraint model
(DyCSC), whose core idea is to capture the evolution of temporal networks by
imposing a temporal constraint on the tendency of the nodes in the network to a
given number of clusters. It not only generates low-dimensional embedding
vectors for nodes but also preserves the dynamic nonlinear features of temporal
networks. Experimental results on multiple realworld datasets have demonstrated
the superiority of DyCSC for temporal graph embedding, as it consistently
outperforms competing methods by significant margins in multiple temporal link
prediction tasks. Moreover, the ablation study further validates the
effectiveness of the proposed temporal constraint.

that inherent ferromagnetism can be obtained in the prominent allotrope,
penta-graphene, which has an unique Mexican-hat valence band edge, giving rise
to van Hove singularities and electronic instability. Induced by modest
hole-doping, being achievable in electrolyte gate, the semiconducting
pentagraphene can transform into different ferromagnetic half-metals with room

anisotropic Weyl states, including type-I and type-II Weyl cones and hybrid
quasi Weyl nodal loop, can be found in a sizable energy window of spin-down

most studies on hypergraphs focus on a small set of theoretical models. Here,
we introduce a class of models for random hypergraphs which displays a similar
level of flexibility of complex network models and where the main ingredient is
the probability that a node belongs to a hyperedge. When this probability is a
constant, we obtain a random hypergraph in the same spirit as the Erdos-Renyi
graph. This framework also allows us to introduce different ingredients such as
the preferential attachment for hypergraphs, or spatial random hypergraphs. In
particular, we show that for the Erdos-Renyi case there is a transition
threshold scaling as $1/\sqrt{EN}$ where $N$ is the number of nodes and $E$ the
number of hyperedges. We also discuss a random geometric hypergraph which
displays a percolation transition for a threshold distance scaling as
$r_c^*\sim 1/\sqrt{E}$. For these various models, we provide results for the
most interesting measures, and also introduce new ones in the spatial case for
characterizing the geometrical properties of hyperedges. These different models
might serve as benchmarks useful for analyzing empirical data.

multi-fidelity active learning approach for high-dimensional outputs, which can
acquire examples at different fidelities to reduce the cost while improving the
learning performance. However, this method only queries at one pair of fidelity
and input at a time, and hence has a risk to bring in strongly correlated
examples to reduce the learning efficiency. In this paper, we propose Batch
Multi-Fidelity Active Learning with Budget Constraints (BMFAL-BC), which can
promote the diversity of training examples to improve the benefit-cost ratio,
while respecting a given budget constraint for batch queries. Hence, our method
can be more practically useful. Specifically, we propose a novel batch

convert the original system operational over finite time interval into one
operational over infinite time interval, allowing for Lyapunov asymptotic
design and recasting prescribed-time stabilization on finite time domain into
asymptotic stabilization on infinite time domain. Second, to deal with
time-varying parameters with unknown variation boundaries, we use congelation
of variables method and establish three separate adaptive laws for parameter
estimation (two for the unknown parameters in the feedback path and one for the
unknown parameter in the input path), in doing so we utilize two tuning
functions to eliminate over-parametrization. Third, to achieve asymptotic
convergence for the transformed system, we make use of nonlinear damping design
and non-regressor-based design to cope with time-varying perturbations, and
finally, we derive the prescribed-time control scheme from the asymptotic
controller via inverse temporal-scale transformation. The boundedness of all

targets for characterisation with upcoming large space- and ground-based
facilities. Since large-scale exoplanet searches will not be feasible with such
telescopes, it is crucial to use currently available data and instruments to
find possible target planets before next generation facilities come online.
  Aims. We aim at detecting new extrasolar planets around stars in the solar
neighbourhood by blind radial velocity (RV) search with ESPRESSO. Our target
sample consist of nearby stars (d < 11 pc) with little (< 10) or no previous RV
measurements.
  Methods. We use 31 radial velocity measurements obtained with ESPRESSO at the
VLT between December 2020 and February 2022 of the nearby M dwarf star (M_star
= 0.21 M_sun, d = 10.23 pc) L 363-38 to derive the orbital parameters of the
newly discovered planet. In addition, we use TESS photometry and archival
VLT/NaCo high contrast imaging data to put further constraints on the orbit
inclination and the possible planetary system architecture around L 363-38.
  Results. We present the detection of a new extrasolar planet orbiting the
nearby M dwarf star L 363-38. L 363-38 b is a planet with minimum mass mp

d, corresponding to a semi-major axis a = 0.048+/-0.006 AU, which is well
inside the inner edge of the habitable zone. We further estimate a minimum
radius rp sin(i) = 1.55 - 2.75 R_Earth and an equilibrium temperature Teq =
330K.

the entanglement generation between two gravitationally coupled massive

problem of global exponential stabilization of strict-feedback systems with
mismatched uncertainties and unknown yet time-varying control gains. The
resultant control, embedded with time-varying feedback gains, is capable of
ensuring global exponential stability of parametric-strict-feedback systems in
the absence of persistence of excitation. By using the enhanced Nussbaum
function, the previous results are extended to more general nonlinear systems
where the sign and magnitude of the time-varying control gain are unknown. In
particular, the argument of the Nussbaum function is guaranteed to be always
positive with the aid of nonlinear damping design, which is critical to perform
a straightforward technical analysis of the boundedness of the Nussbaum

strict-feedback systems, the boundedness of the control input and the update

to be a key process of formation of solar active regions and driving solar
eruptions. Due to the limited capability of observation, the flux emergence
process is commonly studied using numerical simulations. In this paper, we
developed a numerical model to simulate the emergence of a twisted magnetic
flux tube from the convection zone to the corona using the AMR--CESE--MHD code,
which is based on the conservation-element solution-element method with
adaptive mesh refinement. The result of our simulation agrees with that of many
previous ones with similar initial conditions but using different numerical
codes. In the early stage, the flux tube rises from the convection zone as
driven by the magnetic buoyancy until it reaches close to the photosphere. The
emergence is decelerated there and with piling-up of the magnetic flux, the
magnetic buoyancy instability is triggered, which allows the magnetic field to
partially enter into the atmosphere. Meanwhile, two gradually separated
polarity concentration zones appear in the photospheric layer, transporting the
magnetic field and energy into the atmosphere through their vortical and
shearing motions. Correspondingly, the coronal magnetic field has also been
reshaped to a sigmoid configuration containing a thin current layer, which
resembles the typical pre-eruptive magnetic configuration of an active region.
Such a numerical framework of magnetic flux emergence as established will be
applied in future investigations of how solar eruptions are initiated in flux
emergence active regions.

and F$_{1,2}$ are superconductors and ferromagnets, and $f_{L, C, R}$ are the
left, central, and right spin-active interfaces. These interfaces have
noncollinear magnetizations, and the azimuthal angles of the magnetizations at
the $f_{L, C, R}$ interfaces are $\chi_{L, C, R}$. We demonstrate that, if both
the ferromagnets have antiparallel magnetizations, the critical current
oscillates as a function of the exchange field and the thickness of the
ferromagnets for particular $\chi_L$ or $\chi_R$. By contrast, when the
magnetization at the $f_C$ interface is perpendicular to that at the $f_L$ and
$f_R$ interfaces, the critical current reaches a larger value and is hardly
affected by the exchange field and the thickness. Interestingly, if both the
ferromagnets are converted to antiparallel half-metals, the critical current
maintains a constant value and rarely changes with the ferromagnetic
thicknesses and the azimuthal angles. At this time, an anomalous supercurrent
can appear in the system, in which case the Josephson current still exists even
if the superconducting phase difference $\phi$ is zero. This supercurrent
satisfies the current-phase relation $I=I_c\sin(\phi+\phi_0)$ with $I_c$ being
the critical current and $\phi_0=2\chi_C-\chi_L-\chi_R$. We deduce that the
additional phase $\phi_0$ arises from phase superposition, where the phase is
captured by the spin-triplet pairs when they pass through each spin-active
interface. In addition, when both the ferromagnets are transformed into
parallel half-metals, the $f_C$ interface never contributes any phase to the
supercurrent and $\phi_0=\chi_R-\chi_L+\pi$. In such a case, the current-phase
relation is similar to that in a S/$f_L$-F-$f_R$/S junction.

the detectability by FASER. We focus on four types of CLFV interactions, i.e.,
the scalar-, pseudoscalar-, vector-, and dipole-type interaction, and calculate
the sensitivity of FASER to each CLFV interaction. We show that, with the setup
of FASER2, a wide region of the parameter space can be explored. Particularly,
it is found that FASER2 has a sensitivity to very small coupling regions in
which the rare muon decays, such as $\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$, cannot place

Computed Tomography (SVCT) reconstruction tasks as a self-supervised deep
learning framework. NeRF-based SVCT methods represent the desired CT image as a
continuous function of spatial coordinates and train a Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) to learn the function by minimizing loss on the SV sinogram. Benefiting
from the continuous representation provided by NeRF, the high-quality CT image
can be reconstructed. However, existing NeRF-based SVCT methods strictly
suppose there is completely no relative motion during the CT acquisition
because they require \textit{accurate} projection poses to model the X-rays
that scan the SV sinogram. Therefore, these methods suffer from severe
performance drops for real SVCT imaging with motion. In this work, we propose a
self-calibrating neural field to recover the artifacts-free image from the
rigid motion-corrupted SV sinogram without using any external data.
Specifically, we parametrize the inaccurate projection poses caused by rigid
motion as trainable variables and then jointly optimize these pose variables
and the MLP. We conduct numerical experiments on a public CT image dataset. The
results indicate our model significantly outperforms two representative
NeRF-based methods for SVCT reconstruction tasks with four different levels of
rigid motion.

apply the circuit, in the field of non-Hermitian physics, to the measurement of
generalized expectations with respect to left and right eigenstates of a given

in the prototypical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with nonreciprocal hopping by
measuring the Bloch and non-Bloch spin textures and the corresponding winding

building up these winding numbers can be well captured with high fidelity, and
the distinct topological phase transitions between PBCs and OBCs are clearly
characterized. We may expect that other non-Hermitian topological invariants
composed of non-Hermitian spin textures, such as non-Hermitian Chern numbers,

partially occluded. This task is particularly challenging on two levels: (1) it
requires more information than what is contained in the instant retina or
imaging sensor, (2) it is difficult to obtain enough well-annotated amodal
labels for supervision. To this end, this paper develops a new framework of
Self-supervised amodal Video object segmentation (SaVos). Our method
efficiently leverages the visual information of video temporal sequences to
infer the amodal mask of objects. The key intuition is that the occluded part
of an object can be explained away if that part is visible in other frames,
possibly deformed as long as the deformation can be reasonably learned.
Accordingly, we derive a novel self-supervised learning paradigm that
efficiently utilizes the visible object parts as the supervision to guide the
training on videos. In addition to learning type prior to complete masks for
known types, SaVos also learns the spatiotemporal prior, which is also useful
for the amodal task and could generalize to unseen types. The proposed
framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the synthetic amodal
segmentation benchmark FISHBOWL and the real world benchmark KINS-Video-Car.
Further, it lends itself well to being transferred to novel distributions using
test-time adaptation, outperforming existing models even after the transfer to
a new distribution.

two-phase test is a special case of a sequential test with only two decision
time points: the first phase of our test is a fixed-length test with a reject

achievable error exponents using the method of types and derive a converse
result for the optimal sequential test using the techniques recently proposed
by Hsu, Li and Wang (ITW, 2022) for binary classification. Analytically and
numerically, we show that our two phase test achieves the performance of an
optimal sequential test with proper choice of test parameters. In particular,
similarly as the optimal sequential test, our test does not need a final reject
option to achieve the optimal error exponent region while an optimal
fixed-length test needs a reject option to achieve the same region. Finally, we
specialize our results to binary classification when $M=2$ and to $M$-ary
hypothesis testing when the ratio of the lengths of training sequences and
testing sequences tends to infinity so that generating distributions can be

Persistence of excitation (PE) and the Granger Causality Test (GCT). The
virtual data sequences are designed with the hankel matrix representation such
that the dimensions of the subspace spanning the essential system modes are
increased with the addition of new state variables. The PE condition provides
the lower bound for the trajectory length, and the GCT provides the order of
the model. Satisfying the PE condition enables estimating an approximate linear
model, but the predictability with the identified model is only assured with
the temporal causation among data searched with GCT. The proposed methodology
is validated with the application for coherency identification (CI) in a

stability analysis. The significance of PE condition and GCT is demonstrated
through various case studies implemented on 22 bus six generator system.

hallmark of human intelligence and yet remains out of reach for machines. This
remarkable capability has been attributed to our abilities to make conceptual
abstraction and analogy, and to a mechanism known as indirection, which binds
two representations and uses one representation to refer to the other. Inspired
by these mechanisms, we hypothesize that OOD generalization may be achieved by
performing analogy-making and indirection in the functional space instead of
the data space as in current methods. To realize this, we design FINE
(Functional Indirection Neural Estimator), a neural framework that learns to
compose functions that map data input to output on-the-fly. FINE consists of a
backbone network and a trainable semantic memory of basis weight matrices. Upon
seeing a new input-output data pair, FINE dynamically constructs the backbone
weights by mixing the basis weights. The mixing coefficients are indirectly
computed through querying a separate corresponding semantic memory using the
data pair. We demonstrate empirically that FINE can strongly improve
out-of-distribution generalization on IQ tasks that involve geometric
transformations. In particular, we train FINE and competing models on IQ tasks
using images from the MNIST, Omniglot and CIFAR100 datasets and test on tasks
with unseen image classes from one or different datasets and unseen
transformation rules. FINE not only achieves the best performance on all tasks
but also is able to adapt to small-scale data scenarios.

that our proposed HiFi-WaveGAN significantly outperforms other neural vocoders

constructed by correlating the observed galaxy field with an
appropriately-weighted square of it. We perform numerical Fisher forecasts
using two synthetic datasets; the halo catalogs from the Quijote N-body
simulations and the galaxy catalogs from the Molino suite. The latter serves to
understand the effect of marginalization over a more complex matter-tracer
biasing relation. Compared to the power spectrum multipoles, we show that the
skew spectra substantially improve the constraints on six parameters of the
$\nu\Lambda$CDM model, $\{\Omega_m, \Omega_b, h, n_s, \sigma_8, M_\nu\}$.
Imposing a small-scale cutoff of $k_{\rm max}=0.25 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}h$, the
improvements from skew spectra alone range from 23% to 62% for the Quijote
halos and from 32% to 71% for the Molino galaxies. Compared to the previous
analysis of the bispectrum monopole on the same data and using the same range
of scales, the skew spectra of Quijote halos provide competitive constraints.
Conversely, the skew spectra outperform the bispectrum monopole for all
cosmological parameters for the Molino catalogs. This may result from
additional anisotropic information, particularly enhanced in the Molino sample,
that is captured by the skew spectra but not by the bispectrum monopole. Our
stability analysis of the numerical derivatives shows comparable convergence
rates for the power spectrum and the skew spectra, indicating potential
underestimation of parameter uncertainties by at most 30%.

system sizes beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. Here, we develop tensor
network methods that can access much larger systems and determine universal and
nonuniversal features in their entanglement. Specifically, we construct
one-dimensional matrix product operators that encapsulate all the entanglement
data of two-dimensional symmetry-protected topological states. We first
demonstrate our approach for the Levin-Gu model. Next, we use the cohomology
formalism to deform the phase away from the fine-tuned point and track the
evolution of its entanglement features and their symmetry resolution. The
entanglement spectra are always described by the same conformal field theory.
However, the levels undergo a spectral flow in accordance with an insertion of
a many-body Aharonov-Bohm flux.

such annotations is non-trivial. Some existing methods generate large-scale
synthesized data with location annotations, which is only composed of real
images and cannot capture the properties of forgery regions. Others generate
forgery location labels by subtracting paired real and fake images, yet such
paired data is difficult to collected and the generated label is usually
discontinuous. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Unsupervised
Inconsistency-Aware method based on Vision Transformer, called UIA-ViT, which
only makes use of video-level labels and can learn inconsistency-aware feature
without pixel-level annotations. Due to the self-attention mechanism, the
attention map among patch embeddings naturally represents the consistency
relation, making the vision Transformer suitable for the consistency
representation learning. Based on vision Transformer, we propose two key
components: Unsupervised Patch Consistency Learning (UPCL) and Progressive
Consistency Weighted Assemble (PCWA). UPCL is designed for learning the
consistency-related representation with progressive optimized pseudo
annotations. PCWA enhances the final classification embedding with previous
patch embeddings optimized by UPCL to further improve the detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

inherent relationships between adjacent local regions lack exploration, while
local structural information is crucial in a transformer-based 3D point cloud
model. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel module named Local Context
Propagation (LCP) to exploit the message passing between neighboring local
regions and make their representations more informative and discriminative.
More specifically, we use the overlap points of adjacent local regions (which
statistically show to be prevalent) as intermediaries, then re-weight the
features of these shared points from different local regions before passing
them to the next layers. Inserting the LCP module between two transformer
layers results in a significant improvement in network expressiveness. Finally,
we design a flexible LCPFormer architecture equipped with the LCP module. The
proposed method is applicable to different tasks and outperforms various
transformer-based methods in benchmarks including 3D shape classification and
dense prediction tasks such as 3D object detection and semantic segmentation.

systems can be divided into three categories: those that use features, those
that rely on the image itself, and hybrid models. In the case of feature-based
methods, new research has evolved to incorporate more information from their
environment using geometric primitives beyond points, such as lines and planes.
This is because in many environments, which are man-made environments,
characterized as Manhattan world, geometric primitives such as lines and planes
occupy most of the space in the environment. The exploitation of these schemes
can lead to the introduction of algorithms capable of optimizing the trajectory
of a Visual SLAM system and also helping to construct an exuberant map. Thus,
we present a real-time monocular Visual SLAM system that incorporates real-time
methods for line and VP extraction, as well as two strategies that exploit
vanishing points to estimate the robot's translation and improve its
rotation.Particularly, we build on ORB-SLAM2, which is considered the current
state-of-the-art solution in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, and extend
its formulation to handle lines and VPs to create two strategies the first
optimize the rotation and the second refine the translation part from the known
rotation. First, we extract VPs using a real-time method and use them for a
global rotation optimization strategy. Second, we present a translation
estimation method that takes advantage of last-stage rotation optimization to
model a linear system. Finally, we evaluate our system on the TUM RGB-D

results and runs in real time, and its performance remains close to the
original ORB-SLAM2 system

remains challenging to achieve high performance in occluded and crowded scenes.
It could be attributed mostly to the widely used representation of pedestrians,

location and size of the object. Bounding box models the object as a uniform
distribution within the boundary, making pedestrians indistinguishable in
occluded and crowded scenes due to much noise. To eliminate the problem, we
propose a novel representation based on 2D beta distribution, named Beta

relationship between full-body and visible boxes, and emphasizes the center of
visual mass by assigning different probability values to pixels. As a result,
Beta Representation is much better for distinguishing highly-overlapped

to fully exploit Beta Representation, a novel pipeline Beta R-CNN equipped with

  Prediction","8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables",,,,"q-bio.BM cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  GNN-based methods have achieved excellent results as a mainstream task in
drug response prediction tasks in recent years. Traditional GNN methods use
only the atoms in a drug molecule as nodes to obtain the representation of the
molecular graph through node information passing, whereas the method using the
transformer can only extract information about the nodes. However, the covalent
bonding and chirality of a drug molecule have a great influence on the
pharmacological properties of the molecule, and these information are implied
in the chemical bonds formed by the edges between the atoms. In addition, CNN
methods for modelling cell lines genomics sequences can only perceive local
rather than global information about the sequence. In order to solve the above
problems, we propose the decoupled dual transformer structure with edge
embedded for drug respond prediction (TransEDRP), which is used for the
representation of cell line genomics and drug respectively. For the drug
branch, we encoded the chemical bond information within the molecule as the
embedding of the edge in the molecular graph, extracted the global structural
and biochemical information of the drug molecule using graph transformer. For
the branch of cell lines genomics, we use the multi-headed attention mechanism
to globally represent the genomics sequence. Finally, the drug and genomics
branches are fused to predict IC50 values through the transformer layer and the
fully connected layer, which two branches are different modalities. Extensive
experiments have shown that our method is better than the current mainstream
approach in all evaluation indicators.

present a Feature Fusion Attention module that leverages the channel-wise
attention to encourage the consistency of the room, wall, and door predictions,

implications for how countries research and develop weapons systems, and how
militaries deploy those systems on the battlefield. The idea of AI-enabled
military systems has motivated some activists to call for restrictions or bans
on some weapon systems, while others have argued that AI may be too diffuse to
control. This paper argues that while a ban on all military applications of AI
is likely infeasible, there may be specific cases where arms control is
possible. Throughout history, the international community has attempted to ban
or regulate weapons or military systems for a variety of reasons. This paper
analyzes both successes and failures and offers several criteria that seem to
influence why arms control works in some cases and not others. We argue that
success or failure depends on the desirability (i.e., a weapon's military value
versus its perceived horribleness) and feasibility (i.e., sociopolitical
factors that influence its success) of arms control. Based on these criteria,
and the historical record of past attempts at arms control, we analyze the
potential for AI arms control in the future and offer recommendations for what
policymakers can do today.

further investigation into the safety of large events that involve a gathering
of people. This study aims to investigate how COVID-19 can spread through a
large crowd of people shopping in a store with no safety precautions taken. The
event being investigated is Black Friday, where hundreds or thousands of
customers flood stores to hopefully receive the best deals on popular items. A
mock store was created, separated into several different shopping sections, and
represented using a 2-D grid where each square on the grid represented a 5 feet
by 5 feet area of the mock store. Customers were simulated to enter the store,
shop for certain items, check out, and then leave the store. A percentage of
customers were chosen to be infective when they entered the store, which means
that they could spread infection quantum to other customers. Four hours of time
was simulated with around 6,000 customers being included. The maximum distance
exposure could be spread (2 feet-10 feet), the minimum time of exposure needed
to become infected (2 - 15 minutes), and the total percentage of customers who
started as infective (1% - 5%) were all changed and their effects on the number
of newly infected customers were measured. It was found that increasing the
maximum exposure distance by 2 feet resulted in between a 20% to 250% increase
in newly infected customers, depending on the distances being used. It was also
found that increasing the percentage of customers who started as infective from
1% to 2% and then to 5% resulted in a 200% to 300% increase in newly infected
customers.

substantially better accuracy and search efficiency over data-agnostic indices
by overfitting to the index data distribution. When the query data is drawn
from a different distribution - e.g., when index represents image embeddings
and query represents textual embeddings - such algorithms lose much of this
performance advantage. On a variety of datasets, for a fixed recall target,
latency is worse by an order of magnitude or more for Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)
queries as compared to In-Distribution (ID) queries. The question we address in
this work is whether ANNS algorithms can be made efficient for OOD queries if
the index construction is given access to a small sample set of these queries.
We answer positively by presenting OOD-DiskANN, which uses a sparing sample (1%
of index set size) of OOD queries, and provides up to 40% improvement in mean
query latency over SoTA algorithms of a similar memory footprint. OOD-DiskANN
is scalable and has the efficiency of graph-based ANNS indices. Some of our
