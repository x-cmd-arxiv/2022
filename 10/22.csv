engineered by the relative twist angle between layers. Here, we study the
twist-dependent moire coupling in MoSe2 homobilayers. For small angles, we find
a pronounced redshift of the K-K and {\Gamma}-K excitons accompanied by a
transition from K-K to {\Gamma}-K emission. Both effects can be traced back to
the underlying moire pattern in the MoSe2 homobilayers, as confirmed by our
low-energy continuum model for different moire excitons. We identify two
distinct intralayer moire excitons for R-stacking, while H-stacking yields two
degenerate intralayer excitons due to inversion symmetry. In both cases, bright
interlayer excitons are found at higher energies. The performed calculations
are in excellent agreement with experiment and allow us to characterize the
observed exciton resonances, providing insight about the layer composition and
relevant stacking configuration of different moire exciton species.

business processes, e.g., an invoice should be cleared within 48 hours after
the corresponding goods receipt, by analyzing event data. Existing techniques
for constraint monitoring assume that a single case notion exists in a business
process, e.g., a patient in a healthcare process, and each event is associated
with the case notion. However, in reality, business processes are
object-centric, i.e., multiple case notions (objects) exist, and an event may
be associated with multiple objects. For instance, an Order-To-Cash (O2C)
process involves order, item, delivery, etc., and they interact when executing
an event, e.g., packing multiple items together for a delivery. The existing
techniques produce misleading insights when applied to such object-centric
business processes. In this work, we propose an approach to monitoring
constraints in object-centric business processes. To this end, we introduce
Object-Centric Constraint Graphs (OCCGs) to represent constraints that consider
the interaction of objects. Next, we evaluate the constraints represented by
OCCGs by analyzing Object-Centric Event Logs (OCELs) that store the interaction
of different objects in events. We have implemented a web application to

space onto a low-dimensional learned manifold, typically an image manifold. The
intermediate values between the latent space and image manifold can be
interpreted as noisy images which are determined by the noise scheduling scheme
employed during pre-training. We exploit this interpretation to introduce
Boomerang, a local image manifold sampling approach using the dynamics of
diffusion models. We call it Boomerang because we first add noise to an input
image, moving it closer to the latent space, then bring it back to the image
space through diffusion dynamics. We use this method to generate images which
are similar, but nonidentical, to the original input images on the image
manifold. We are able to set how close the generated image is to the original
based on how much noise we add. Additionally, the generated images have a
degree of stochasticity, allowing us to locally sample as many times as we want
without repetition. We show three applications for which Boomerang can be used.
First, we provide a framework for constructing privacy-preserving datasets
having controllable degrees of anonymity. Second, we show how to use Boomerang
for data augmentation while staying on the image manifold. Third, we introduce
a framework for image super-resolution with 8x upsampling. Boomerang does not
require any modification to the training of diffusion models and can be used

the solutions to high dimensional PDEs, opening lines of theoretical inquiry
focused on explaining how it is that these models appear to evade the curse of
dimensionality. However, most prior theoretical analyses have been limited to
linear PDEs. In this work, we take a step towards studying the representational
power of neural networks for approximating solutions to nonlinear PDEs. We
focus on a class of PDEs known as \emph{nonlinear elliptic variational PDEs},
whose solutions minimize an \emph{Euler-Lagrange} energy functional
$\mathcal{E}(u) = \int_\Omega L(x, u(x), \nabla u(x)) - f(x) u(x)dx$. We show
that if composing a function with Barron norm $b$ with partial derivatives of
$L$ produces a function of Barron norm at most $B_L b^p$, the solution to the
PDE can be $\epsilon$-approximated in the $L^2$ sense by a function with Barron
norm $O\left(\left(dB_L\right)^{\max\{p \log(1/ \epsilon),
p^{\log(1/\epsilon)}\}}\right)$. By a classical result due to Barron [1993],
this correspondingly bounds the size of a 2-layer neural network needed to
approximate the solution. Treating $p, \epsilon, B_L$ as constants, this
quantity is polynomial in dimension, thus showing neural networks can evade the
curse of dimensionality. Our proof technique involves neurally simulating
(preconditioned) gradient in an appropriate Hilbert space, which converges
exponentially fast to the solution of the PDE, and such that we can bound the
increase of the Barron norm at each iterate. Our results subsume and
substantially generalize analogous prior results for linear elliptic PDEs over

represented by chemical reaction networks. Systems with low numbers of
particles are frequently modelled as discrete-state Markov jump processes and
are typically simulated via a stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). An SSA,
while accurate, is often unsuitable for systems with large numbers of
individuals, and can become prohibitively expensive with increasing reaction
frequency. Large systems are often modelled deterministically using ordinary
differential equations, sacrificing accuracy and stochasticity for
computational efficiency and analytical tractability. In this paper, we present
a novel hybrid technique for the accurate and efficient simulation of large
chemical reaction networks. This technique, which we name the mass-conversion
method, couples a discrete-state Markov jump process to a system of ordinary
differential equations by simulating a reaction network using both techniques
simultaneously. Individual molecules in the network are represented by exactly
one regime at any given time, and may switch their governing regime depending
on particle density. In this manner, we model high copy-number species using
the cheaper continuum method and low copy-number species using the more
expensive, discrete-state stochastic method to preserve the impact of
stochastic fluctuations at low copy number. The motivation, as with similar
methods, is to retain the advantages while mitigating the shortfalls of each
method. We demonstrate the performance and accuracy of our method for several
test problems that exhibit varying degrees of inter-connectivity and complexity
by comparing averaged trajectories obtained from both our method and from exact
stochastic simulation.

stellar companions form from the same natal gas cloud and are thus expected to

measurements have occasionally yielded rocky enhancements, but few observations
targeted known planetary systems. To address this gap, we carried out a
Keck-HIRES survey of 36 multi-star systems where at least one star is a known
planet host. We found that only HAT-P-4 exhibits an abundance pattern
suggestive of engulfment, but is more likely primordial based on its large
projected separation (30,000 $\pm$ 140 AU) that exceeds typical turbulence
scales in molecular clouds. To understand the lack of engulfment detections
among our systems, we quantified the strength and duration of refractory
enrichments in stellar photospheres using MESA stellar models. We found that
observable signatures from 10 $M_{\oplus}$ engulfment events last for $\sim$90
Myr in 1 $M_{\odot}$ stars. Signatures are largest and longest lived for
1.1$-$1.2 $M_{\odot}$ stars, but are no longer observable $\sim$2 Gyr

an $N$-dimensional (Pad\'e) approximation to the delay, affording (optimal)
state estimate feedback vis-\`a-vis the separation principle. Using this

wave-function $|\Psi\rangle$ of $T$ (i.e. $\langle\Omega|\Psi\rangle$) gives
rise to partition functions of conformal (including topological) theories in
$D$ dimensions with categorical symmetry related to $T$, realizing a
holographic relation discussed in the literature explicitly. We illustrate this
in explicit examples at $D=1,2,3$. Exact eigenstates of the RG operator can be
solved explicitly from (higher) separable Frobenius algebra of the (higher)
input fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ defining the lattice model of $T$, and they
give the $D$ dimensional symmetric TQFTs. Eigenstates corresponding to actual
conformal theories describe phase transitions between these topological fixed
points. The critical points can be searched numerically and we demonstrate that
known critical couplings of $SU(2)_k$ integrable lattice models are numerically
recovered from our procedure, alongside a curious tricritical point that we
found at $k=4$. We demonstrate that the 2+1 D Ising model can also be obtained
as a strange correlator with the associated 4D topological order being the 4D
toric code. The numerical procedure that we devise to search for the 3D
critical temperature is a novel tensor renormalization group algorithm, that
fully harnesses the algebraic and geometric properties of the RG operator.
Finally since the RG operator is in fact an exact analytic holographic tensor
network, we compute ``bulk-boundary'' correlator and compare with AdS/CFT.
Promisingly, they are numerically compatible given our accuracy, although
further works will be needed to explore the precise connection to the AdS/CFT
correspondence.

a novel approach to predict the user's intent (the user speaking to the device
or not) directly from acoustic and textual information encoded at subword
tokens which are obtained via an end-to-end ASR model. Modeling directly the
subword tokens, compared to modeling of the phonemes and/or full words, has at
least two advantages: (i) it provides a unique vocabulary representation, where
each token has a semantic meaning, in contrast to the phoneme-level
representations, (ii) each subword token has a reusable ""sub""-word acoustic
pattern (that can be used to construct multiple full words), resulting in a
largely reduced vocabulary space than of the full words. To learn the subword
representations for the audio-to-intent classification, we extract: (i)
acoustic information from an E2E-ASR model, which provides frame-level CTC
posterior probabilities for the subword tokens, and (ii) textual information
from a pre-trained continuous bag-of-words model capturing the semantic meaning
of the subword tokens. The key to our approach is the way it combines acoustic
subword-level posteriors with text information using the notion of
positional-encoding in order to account for multiple ASR hypotheses
simultaneously. We show that our approach provides more robust and richer
representations for audio-to-intent classification, and is highly accurate with
correctly mitigating 93.3% of unintended user audio from invoking the smart

dictionaries that densely represent the observed data, which makes
interpretation of the coefficients challenging and may also lead to poor
empirical performance when using the learned coefficients in downstream tasks.
In contrast and motivated by sparse dictionary learning in Euclidean spaces, we
propose a geometrically sparse regularizer for Wasserstein space that promotes
representations of a data point using only nearby dictionary elements. We show
this approach leads to sparse representations in Wasserstein space and
addresses the problem of non-uniqueness of barycentric representation.
Moreover, when data is generated as Wasserstein barycenters of fixed

stewardship to cutting edge scientific research. Central to these pursuits is a
robust pipeline for nuclear modeling as well as data assimilation and
dissemination. We summarize a small portion of the ongoing nuclear data efforts
at Los Alamos for medium mass to heavy nuclei. We begin with an overview of the
NEXUS framework and show how one of its modules can be used for model parameter
optimization using Bayesian techniques. The mathematical framework affords the
combination of different measured data in determining model parameters and
their associated correlations. It also has the advantage of being able to
quantify outliers in data. We exemplify the power of this procedure by
highlighting the recently evaluated 239-Pu cross section. We further showcase
the success of our tools and pipeline by covering the insight gained from
incorporating the latest nuclear modeling and data in astrophysical simulations
as part of the Fission In R-process Elements (FIRE) collaboration.

of lives and causing billions of dollars in damage every year. Under climate
change, their impact and intensity are expected to worsen significantly.
Unfortunately, general circulation models (GCMs), which are currently the
primary tool for climate projections, cannot characterize weather extremes
accurately. To address this, we present a multi-resolution deep-learning
framework that, firstly, corrects a GCM's biases by matching low-order and tail
statistics of its output with observations at coarse scales; and secondly,
increases the level of detail of the debiased GCM output by reconstructing the
finer scales as a function of the coarse scales. We use the proposed framework
to generate statistically realistic realizations of the climate over Western
Europe from a simple GCM corrected using observational atmospheric reanalysis.
We also discuss implications for probabilistic risk assessment of natural
disasters in a changing climate.

The goal of our quantum algorithm is the calculation of operator averages of an
open quantum system evolving in time. Selected low-noise system qubits and
noisy bath qubits represent the system and the bath of the open quantum system.
All incoherent qubit noise can be mapped to bath spectral functions. The form
of the spectral functions can be tuned digitally, allowing for the time
evolution of a wide range of open-system models at finite temperature. We study
the feasibility of this approach with a focus on the solution of the spin-boson
model and assume intrinsic qubit noise that is dominated by damping and
dephasing. We find that classes of open quantum systems exist where our
algorithm performs very well, even with gate errors as high as 1%. In general
the presented algorithm performs best if the system-bath interactions can be
decomposed into native gates.

weights of exponential type that the unique solutions converge in a weak or
strong sense (dependent on the regularity of the velocity) to the entropy
solution of the local conservation law when the nonlocal weight approaches a
Dirac distribution. To this end, we establish first a uniform total variation
estimate on the nonlocal velocity which enables it to prove that the nonlocal
solution is entropy admissible in the limit. For the entropy solution, we use a
tailored entropy flux pair which allows the usage of only one entropy to obtain
uniqueness (given some additional constraints).
  For general weights, we show that monotonicity of the initial datum is
preserved over time which enables it to prove the convergence to the local
entropy solution for rather general kernels and monotone initial datum as well.
This covers the archetypes of local conservation laws: Shock waves and
rarefactions. It also underlines that a ``nonlocal in the velocity''

section in experiments involving few-GeV neutrinos. Combined analyses of data
on deuterium and heavier nuclei points to tensions between the bubble chamber
data and the data of the MINER$\nu$A experiment, which are often ascribed to
unspecified nuclear effects. To understand the origin of these tensions, a
microscopic quantum mechanical framework is needed to compute nuclear matrix
elements. We use the local approximation to the relativistic distorted wave
impulse approximation (RDWIA) to assess the role of final-state nucleon
distortion. To perform this comparison under conditions relevant to neutrino
experiments, we compute cross sections for the MINER$\nu$A and T2K charged pion
production datasets. The inclusion of nucleon distortion leads to a reduction
of the cross section up to 10\%, but to no significant change in shape of the
flux-averaged cross sections. Results with and without distortion compare
favorably to experimental data, with the exception of the low-$Q^2$ MINER$\nu$A
$\pi^+$ data. We point out that hydrogen target data from BEBC is also
overpredicted at low-$Q^2$, and that the discrepancy is similar in shape and
magnitude to what is found in comparison to MINER$\nu$A data. Including nucleon
distortion alone cannot explain the overprediction of low-$Q^2$ cross sections
measured by MINER$\nu$A. The similar overprediction of BEBC data on hydrogen
means that it is impossible to ascribe this discrepancy solely to a nuclear
effect. Axial couplings and their $Q^2$ dependence should ideally be derived
from more precise data on hydrogen and deuterium.

rather complicated lattice models and hard-to-manipulate dynamics; even the
simplest system that can realize universal TQC--the Fibonacci anyon
system--lacks a physical realization, let alone braiding the non-Abelian

Fibonacci anyons. Via braiding the Fibonacci anyons, we can implement universal
quantum gates on the logical space. Our proposal is platform-independent. As a
demonstration, we implement a topological Hadamard gate on a logical qubit
through a sequence of $15$ braiding operations of three Fibonacci anyons with
merely $2$ nuclear spin qubits. The gate fidelity reaches 97.18% by randomized
benchmarking. We further prove by experiment that the logical space and
Hadamard gate are topologically protected: local disturbances due to thermal
fluctuations result in a global phase only. Our work is a proof of principle of
TQC and paves the way towards fault-tolerant quantum computation.

manual supervision. The method can extract objects form still images, but uses
videos for supervision. While prior works have considered motion for
segmentation, a key insight is that, while motion can be used to identify
objects, not all objects are necessarily in motion: the absence of motion does
not imply the absence of objects. Hence, our model learns to predict image
regions that are likely to contain motion patterns characteristic of objects
moving rigidly. It does not predict specific motion, which cannot be done
unambiguously from a still image, but a distribution of possible motions, which
includes the possibility that an object does not move at all. We demonstrate
the advantage of this approach over its deterministic counterpart and show
state-of-the-art unsupervised object segmentation performance on simulated and
real-world benchmarks, surpassing methods that use motion even at test time. As
our approach is applicable to variety of network architectures that segment the
scenes, we also apply it to existing image reconstruction-based models showing

quality like the normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and structural
similarity (SSIM) are global metrics which average out impact of subtle
features in the images. Using measures of image quality which incorporate a
subtle signal for a specific task allow for image quality assessment which
locally evaluates the effect of undersampling on a signal. We used a U-Net to
reconstruct under-sampled images with 2x, 3x, 4x and 5x fold 1-D undersampling
rates. Cross validation was performed for a 500 and a 4000 image training set

detecting a subtle signal (small blurred disk) from images with the 4000 image

human observer performance on the 2-AFC studies led to a choice of a 2x
undersampling but the SSIM and NRMSE led to a choice of a 3x undersampling. For
this task, SSIM and NRMSE led to an overestimate of the achievable
undersampling using a U-Net before a steep loss of image quality when compared
to the performance of human observers in the detection of a subtle lesion.

magnetohydrodynamics models with moderate magnetic strengths. Under an
assumption of a hot-jet and cold-disk in the electron temperature prescription,
we confirmed a typical scenario where polarized synchrotron emissions from the
funnel jet experience Faraday rotation and conversion in the equatorial disk.
Further, we found that linear polarization vectors are inevitably depolarized
for edge-on-like observers, whereas a portion of vectors survive and reach the
observers in face-on-like cases. We also found that circular polarization
components have persistent signs in the face-on cases, and changing signs in
the edge-on cases. It is confirmed that these features are smoothly connected
via intermediate viewing-angle cases. These results are due to Faraday
rotation/conversion for different viewing angles, and suggest that a
combination of linear and circular polarimetry can give a constraint on the
inclination between the observer and black hole's (and/or disk's) rotating-axis
and plasma properties in the jet--disk structure. These can also lead to a more

consistently couple states of arbitrarily high spin. But how unique is this
construction? In this paper we derive a novel, multi-parameter family of
four-point scattering amplitudes exhibiting i) polynomially bounded high-energy
behavior and ii) exchange of an infinite tower of high-spin modes, albeit with
a finite number of states at each resonance. These amplitudes take an
infinite-product form and, depending on parameters, exhibit mass spectra that
are either unbounded or bounded, thus corresponding to generalizations of the
Veneziano and Coon amplitudes, respectively. For the bounded case, masses
converge to an accumulation point, a peculiar feature seen in the Coon
amplitude but more recently understood to arise naturally in string theory.
Importantly, our amplitudes contain free parameters allowing for the
customization of the slope and offset of the spin-dependence in the Regge
trajectory. We compute all partial waves for this multi-parameter class of
amplitudes and identify unitary regions of parameter space. For the unbounded
case, we apply similar methods to derive new deformations of the Veneziano and
Virasoro-Shapiro amplitudes.

the subtleties of quantum computing, it is essential to verify that these
parameterized circuits have been compiled correctly. Established equivalence
checking procedures that handle parameter-free circuits already exist. However,
no methodology capable of handling circuits with parameters has been proposed
yet. This work fills this gap by showing that verifying the equivalence of

equivalence checking approach based on the ZX-calculus. At the same time,
proofs of inequality can be efficiently obtained with conventional methods by
taking advantage of the degrees of freedom inherent to parameterized circuits.

transformations on atomic systems; quantum mechanically, residual atom-field
entanglement spoils this promise. Transcoherent states are field states that
fix this problem in the fully quantized regime by generating perfect coherence
in an atom initially in its ground or excited state. We extend this fully
quantized paradigm in four directions: First, we introduce field states that
transform an atom from its ground or excited state to any point on the Bloch
sphere without residual atom-field entanglement. The best strong pulses for
carrying out rotations by angle $\theta$ are are squeezed in photon-number
variance by a factor of $\rm{sinc}\theta$. Next, we investigate implementing
rotation gates, showing that the optimal Gaussian field state for enacting a
$\theta$ pulse on an atom in an arbitrary, unknown initial state is number
squeezed by less: $\rm{sinc}\tfrac{\theta}{2}$. Third, we extend these
investigations to fields interacting with multiple atoms simultaneously,
discovering once again that number squeezing by $\tfrac{\pi}{2}$ is optimal for
enacting $\tfrac{\pi}{2}$ pulses on all of the atoms simultaneously, with small
corrections on the order of the ratio of the number of atoms to the average
number of photons. Finally, we find field states that best perform arbitrary
rotations by $\theta$ through nonlinear interactions involving $m$-photon
absorption, where the same optimal squeezing factor is found to be
$\rm{sinc}\theta$. Backaction in a wide variety of atom-field interactions can
thus be mitigated by squeezing the control fields by optimal amounts.

proposes that during the super-Eddington phase, the disc is quasi-spherical,
radiation-pressure dominated, and accompanied by the production of strong jets.
We construct light curves for both on- and off-axis (with respect to the jet)
observers to account for the anisotropic nature of the jetted emission. We find
that at optical wavelengths, emission from the accretion flow is orders of
magnitude brighter than that produced by the jet, even with boosting from
synchrotron self-Compton. Comparing to the observed jetted TDE Swift
J2058.4+0516, we find that the ZEBRA model accurately captures the timescale
for which accretion remains super-Eddington and reproduces the luminosity of
the transient. However, we find the shape of the light curves deviate at early
times and the radius and temperature of our modelled ZEBRA are $\sim2.7 - 4.1$
times smaller and $\sim1.4 - 2.3$ times larger, respectively, than observed. We
suggest that this indicates the ZEBRA inflates more, and more rapidly, than
currently predicted by the model, and we discuss possible extensions to the

for testing gravity on cosmological scales since they allow measurements of the
luminosity distance. When followed by electromagnetic counterparts, in
particular, they enable a reconstruction of the GW-distance-redshift relation.
In the context of several modified gravity (MG) theories, even when requiring
that the speed of propagation is equal to that of light, this GW distance
differs from the standard electromagnetic luminosity distance due to the
presence of a modified friction in the GW propagation. The very same source of
this friction, which is the running of an effective Planck mass, also affects
the scalar sector generating gravitational slip, i.e. a difference between the
scalar potentials, an observable that can be inferred from large-scale
structure (LSS) probes. In this work, we use a model within effective field
theories for dark energy to exemplify precisely the fact that, at the linear
perturbation level, parametrizing a single function is already enough to
generate simultaneous deviations in the GW distance and the slip. By simulating
multi-messenger GW events that might be detected by the Einstein Telescope in
the future, we compare the constraining power of the two observables on this
single degree of freedom. We then combine forecasts of a Euclid-like survey
with GW simulations, coming to the conclusion that, when using Planck data to
better constrain the cosmological parameters, those future data on the scalar
and tensor sectors are competitive to probe such deviations from General
Relativity, with LSS giving stronger (but more model-dependent) results than
GWs.

  Networks Trained with Large Batch Sizes",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically optimized using various forms of
mini-batch gradient descent algorithm. A major motivation for mini-batch
gradient descent is that with a suitably chosen batch size, available computing
resources can be optimally utilized (including parallelization) for fast model
training. However, many works report the progressive loss of model
generalization when the training batch size is increased beyond some limits.
This is a scenario commonly referred to as generalization gap. Although several
works have proposed different methods for alleviating the generalization gap
problem, a unanimous account for understanding generalization gap is still
lacking in the literature. This is especially important given that recent works
have observed that several proposed solutions for generalization gap problem
such learning rate scaling and increased training budget do not indeed resolve
it. As such, our main exposition in this paper is to investigate and provide
new perspectives for the source of generalization loss for DNNs trained with a
large batch size. Our analysis suggests that large training batch size results
in increased near-rank loss of units' activation (i.e. output) tensors, which
consequently impacts model optimization and generalization. Extensive
experiments are performed for validation on popular DNN models such as VGG-16,

that these slowdowns are due to the unpredictability of each of the words that

fact that humans weight syntactic factors in their predictions more highly than
language models do. We propose a method for estimating syntactic predictability
from a language model, allowing us to weigh the cost of lexical and syntactic
predictability independently. We find that treating syntactic predictability
independently from lexical predictability indeed results in larger estimates of
garden path. At the same time, even when syntactic predictability is
independently weighted, surprisal still greatly underestimate the magnitude of
human garden path effects. Our results support the hypothesis that

the requirement that all RS users have to be able to decode the common message.
We formulate an optimization problem for maximization of the achievable bitrate
of the 360-degree video subject to the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints of
the users. We propose a deep deterministic policy gradient with imitation
learning (Deep-GRAIL) algorithm, in which we leverage deep reinforcement

the IRS phase shifts, RS parameters, beamforming vectors, and bitrate selection

Performance evaluation based on a real-world VR streaming dataset shows that
the proposed IRS-aided RS VR streaming system outperforms several baseline
schemes in terms of system sum-rate, achievable bitrate of the 360-degree

star-formation, thus they are an important way to understand how galaxies
transition from star-forming late-types to quiescent early-types. The recent
discovery of large cold gas reservoirs in PSBs calls into question the theory
that galaxies must lose their gas to become quiescent. Optical Integral Field
Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys have revealed two classes of PSBs: central PSBs with
central quenching regions and ring PSBs with quenching in their outskirts. We
analyze a sample of 13 nearby (z < 0.1) PSBs with spatially resolved optical
IFS data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA)
survey and matched resolution Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array (ALMA)
observations of $^{12}$CO(1-0). Disturbed stellar kinematics in 7/13 of our
PSBs and centrally concentrated molecular gas is consistent with a recent
merger for most of our sample. In galaxies without merger evidence, alternate
processes may funnel gas inwards and suppress star-formation, which may include
outflows, stellar bars, and minor mergers or interactions. The star-formation
efficiencies of the post-starburst regions in nearly half our galaxies are
suppressed while the gas fractions are consistent with star-forming galaxies.
AGN feedback may drive this stabilization, and we observe AGN-consistent
emission in the centers of 5/13 galaxies. Finally, our central and ring PSBs
have similar properties except the ionized and molecular gas in central PSBs is
more disturbed. Overall, the molecular gas in our PSBs tends to be compact and
highly disturbed, resulting in concentrated gas reservoirs unable to form stars
efficiently.

However, most of the existing RGB-D reconstruction methods rely on
pre-calculated accurate camera poses to recover the detailed surface geometry,
where the representation of a surface needs to be adapted when optimizing
different quantities. In this paper, we present a novel multi-view RGB-D based
reconstruction method that tackles camera pose, lighting, albedo, and surface
normal estimation via the utilization of a gradient signed distance field
(gradient-SDF). The proposed method formulates the image rendering process
using specific physically-based model(s) and optimizes the surface's quantities
on the actual surface using its volumetric representation, as opposed to other
works which estimate surface quantities only near the actual surface. To
validate our method, we investigate two physically-based image formation models
for natural light and point light source applications. The experimental results
on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can
recover high-quality geometry of the surface more faithfully than the
state-of-the-art and further improves the accuracy of estimated camera poses.

processes. Recent experiments have revealed that a single nanometer-sized
septin protein can distinguish between membrane-coated glass beads of one
micron and three micron diameters, even though the septin is orders of
magnitude smaller than the beads. This sensing ability is especially surprising
since curvature-sensing proteins must deal with persistent thermal fluctuations
of the membrane, leading to discrepancies between the bead's curvature and the
local membrane curvature sensed instantaneously by a protein. Using continuum
models of fluctuating membranes, we investigate whether it is feasible for a
protein acting as a perfect observer of the membrane to sense micron-scale
curvature either by measuring local membrane curvature or by using bilayer
lipid densities as a proxy. To do this, we develop algorithms to simulate lipid
density and membrane shape fluctuations. We derive physical limits to the
sensing efficacy of a protein in terms of protein size, membrane thickness,
membrane bending modulus, membrane-substrate adhesion strength, and bead size.
To explain the experimental protein-bead association rates, we develop two
classes of predictive models: i) for proteins that maximally associate to a
preferred curvature, and ii) for proteins with enhanced association rates above
a threshold curvature. We find that the experimentally observed sensing
efficacy is close to the theoretical sensing limits imposed on a septin-sized
protein, and that the variance in membrane curvature fluctuations sensed by a
protein determines how sharply the association rate depends on the curvature of
the bead.

observed with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) during the
M-class flare from 2022 January 18 at an unprecedented 0.8 s cadence. Moment
analysis of this line observed in flare ribbon kernels showed that the
intensity, Doppler velocity, and non-thermal broadening exhibited variations
with periods below 10 s. These variations were found to be correlated with
properties of the Gaussian fit to a well-resolved secondary component of the
line redshifted by up to 70 km s$^{-1}$, while the primary component was
consistently observed near the rest wavelength of the line. A particularly high
correlation was found between the non-thermal broadening of the line resulting
from the moment analysis and the redshift of the secondary component. This
means that the oscillatory enhancements in the line broadening were due to
plasma flows (away from the observer) with varying properties. A simple
de-projection of the Doppler velocities of the secondary component based on a
three-dimensional reconstruction of flare loops rooted in the kernel suggests
that the observed flows were caused by downflows and compatible with strong
condensation flows recently predicted by numerical simulations. Furthermore,
peaks of the intensity and the trends of Doppler velocity of the Gaussian fit
to the secondary component (averaged in the ribbon) were found to correspond to
one of the quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) detected during the event in the
soft X-ray flux (as measured by the Geostationary Operational Environmental
Satellite, GOES) and the microwave radio flux (as measured by the Expanded
Owens Valley Solar Array, EOVSA). This result supports a scenario in which the

rate of individual SNRs, which can only come if reliable distances can be
obtained. We aim to determine the distance to the SNR DA 530 (G93.3+6.9), an
object of low surface brightness. To achieve this, we used the Dominion Radio
Astrophysical Observatory Synthesis Telescope and the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory Very Large Array to observe the absorption by intervening HI of the
polarized emission from DA 530. Significant absorption was detected at
velocities $-28$ and -67 km/s (relative to the local standard of rest),
corresponding to distances of 4.4 and 8.3 kpc, respectively. Based on the radio
and X-ray characteristics of DA 530, we conclude that the minimum distance is
4.4$^{+0.4}_{-0.2}$ kpc. At this minimum distance, the diameter of the SNR is
34$^{+4}_{-1}$ pc, and the elevation above the Galactic plane is
537$^{+40}_{-32}$ pc. The $-67$ km/s absorption likely occurs in gas whose
velocity is not determined by Galactic rotation. We present a new data
processing method for combining Stokes $Q$ and $U$ observations of the emission
from an SNR into a single HI absorption spectrum, which avoids the difficulties

setting. Regardless of their success with respect to performance metrics, all
models have uncertainty. We investigate how to visually communicate uncertainty
in this setting in an actionable, trustworthy way. To this end, we conduct a
qualitative study with cardiac critical care clinicians. Our results reveal
that clinician trust may be impacted most not by the degree of uncertainty, but
rather by how transparent the visualization of what the sources of uncertainty
are. Our results show a clear connection between feature interpretability and
clinical actionability.

distribution for the survey weights. This obfuscates the use of fully
parametric bootstrap procedures. To overcome this challenge, we develop a novel
MSE estimator. We estimate the leading term in the MSE, which is the MSE of the
best predictor (constructed with the true parameters), using the same simulated
samples used to construct the basic predictor. We then exploit the asymptotic
normal distribution of the parameter estimators to estimate the second term in
the MSE, which reflects variability in the estimated parameters. We incorporate
a correction for the bias of the estimator of the leading term without the use
of computationally intensive double-bootstrap procedures. We further develop
calibrated prediction intervals that rely less on normal theory than standard
prediction intervals. We empirically demonstrate the validity of the proposed
procedures through extensive simulation studies. We apply the methods to
predict several functions of sheet and rill erosion for Iowa counties using
data from a complex agricultural survey.

physical measurements. The balance between unwanted backaction and the
precision of optical measurements impose a standard quantum limit (SQL) on
interferometric systems. In order to realize a sensitivity below the SQL, it is
necessary to leverage a back-action evading measurement technique, or else
exploit cancellations of any excess noise contributions at the detector. %Many
proof of principle experiments have been performed, but only recently has an
experiment achieved sensitivity below the SQL. In this work, we extend that
initial demonstration and realize sub-SQL measurement sensitivity nearly two
times better than previous measurements, and with architecture applicable to
interferometric gravitational wave detectors. In fact, this technique is
directly applicable to Advanced LIGO, which could observe similar effects with
a detuned signal recycling cavity. By exploiting quantum correlations created
by an optical spring, we measure a total sensitivity below the SQL by
$\textbf{2.8}$ dB, corresponding to a reduction in the noise power by
$\textbf{72}\pm\textbf{5.1}$ \% below the quantum limit. Through the use of a
detuned optical spring, this noise reduction is tunable, allowing us to choose
the desired range of frequencies that fall below the SQL. This result
demonstrates access to sensitivities well below the SQL at frequencies ranges
applicable to LIGO, with the potential to extend the reach of gravitational
wave detectors further into the universe.

and character of the core states varies strongly with local structure, where
mixed dislocations with dangling bonds exhibit a 1D metallic band with a
characteristic 1D density of states ($1/\sqrt{E})$. This 1D Fermi gas is
spatially localized to single atomic diameter orbital chain along the
dislocation core. When the dangling bonds within the core are reconstructed,
the 1D metallic band disappears. In contrast, pure edge dislocations in diamond
reveal a 1D semiconductor with a direct band gap of 3.0 eV. These calculations
provide a possible explanation to the long standing observation of a blue
luminescence band correlated with dislocations in diamond. This opens the door
to using dislocations as 1D quantum phases with functional (electronic and

generalized {L}\""{u}roth problems on the hierarchy of rationality, starting
with the obvious hierarchy between the rationality and the ruledness. Our
primary goal here was to construct very general necessary conditions for a
smooth, not necessary proper, scheme of finite type over the perfect base field
$k$ to be ""retract $(-i)$-rational"". We achieve this goal by constructing
""stably birationalized Nisnevich subsheaf"" $S_{sb}$ inside any Morel's
unramified sheaf $S,$ where $S_{sb}$ coincides with $S$ on proper smooth
$k$-schemes of finite type. Such a stably birationalized Nisnevich subsheaf
$S_{sb}$ sheds a new light on the familiar irrational examples of
Artin-Mumford, Saltman, Colliot-Th\'{e}l\`ene-Ojanguren, Bogomolov, Peyre,
Colliot-Th\'{e}l\`ene-Voisin, and many other retract irrational classifying
space $BG$ examples presented as counterexamples to the Noether problem of the
complex number base field case for a finite group $G.$ In fact, for all of
these examples, the game is not over from our hierarchical perspective! A
consequence of our construction of $S_{sb}$ is the stably birational invariance
of an arbitrary unramified sheaf $S$ on proper smooth $k$-schemes of finite
type. This in particular implies that, for any generalized motivic cohomology
theory, its naively defined unramified (resp. stably birationalized)
gemeralized motivic cohomology theory is stably birational invariant on smooth
proper $k$-schemes of finite type (resp. smooth $k$-schemes of finite type). In
the course of constructing $S_{sb},$ we have also shown a general local
uniformization theorem of the first kind for arbitrary geometric valuations.

improved Fourier plane coverage and will be conducted at multiple frequency

both Sgr A* and M87* transition from optically thin to optically thick.
Resolved spectral index maps in the near-horizon and jet-launching regions of
these supermassive black hole sources can constrain properties of the emitting
plasma that are degenerate in single-frequency images. In addition, combining
information from data obtained at multiple frequencies is a powerful tool for
interferometric image reconstruction, since gaps in spatial scales in

frequencies. Here we present a new method of simultaneously reconstructing
interferometric images at multiple frequencies along with their spectral index

methods commonly used for EHT imaging and is implemented in the eht-imaging
Python software library. We show results of this method on simulated ngEHT data

higher-quality and more scientifically useful results than is possible from

SYM and for classes of $\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\mathcal{N}=1$ Lagrangian quivers
related by S-duality. In these cases the index matches across the S-dual
phases, while models in different S-duality orbits have a different Lens index.
We provide analogous computations for a 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ toric quiver gauge
theory corresponding to a $\mathbb{Z}_7$ orbifold of $\mathbb{C}^3$. This
$SU(n)^7$ gauge theory becomes interesting in the case of $n=2$ because it is
conformally dual to other two models, with symplectic and unitary gauge groups,
bifundamentals and antisymmetric tensors. We explicitly check this triality at
the level of the Lens space index.

most successful methods for carrying out electronic structure calculations of
bulk/crystalline systems -- the plane-wave method -- is a spectral method based
on eigenfunction expansion. Our scheme avoids computationally onerous
approximations involving periodic supercells often employed in conventional
plane-wave calculations of quasi-one-dimensional materials, and also overcomes
several limitations of other discretization strategies, e.g., those based on
finite differences and atomic orbitals. We describe the setup of fast

electronic eigenstates. Miscellaneous computational details, including the
choice of eigensolvers, use of a preconditioning scheme, evaluation of

least some box/peanut (B/P) shaped bulges, which are observed in most massive,

bulges form via the slow trapping of stars onto vertically extended resonant
orbits. The key difference between these two scenarios is that when the bar
buckles, symmetry about the mid-plane is broken for a period of time. We use a
suite of simulations (with and without gas) to show that when the buckling is
sufficiently strong, a residual mid-plane asymmetry persists for several Gyrs
after the end of the buckling phase, and is visible in simulation images. On
the other hand, images of B/P bulges formed through resonant trapping and/or
weak buckling remain symmetric about the mid-plane. We develop two related
diagnostics to identify and quantify mid-plane asymmetry in simulation images
of galaxies that are within 3{\deg} of edge-on orientation, allowing us to test
whether the presence of a B/P-shaped bulge can be explained by a past buckling
event. We apply our diagnostics to two nearly edge-on galaxies with B/P bulges
from the ${\it Spitzer}$ Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies, finding no
mid-plane asymmetry, implying these galaxies formed their bulges either by
resonant trapping or by buckling more than $\sim 5$ Gyr ago. We conclude that
the formation of B/P bulges through strong buckling may be a rare event in the

a general bias-variance decomposition for proper scores, giving rise to the
Bregman Information as the variance term. We discover how exponential families
and the classification log-likelihood are special cases and provide novel
formulations. Surprisingly, we can express the classification case purely in
the logit space. We showcase the practical relevance of this decomposition on
several downstream tasks, including model ensembles and confidence regions.

solving downstream language understanding tasks. However, they generally suffer
from reporting bias, the phenomenon describing the lack of explicit commonsense
knowledge in written text, e.g., ''an orange is orange''. To overcome this
limitation, we develop a novel approach, Z-LaVI, to endow language models with
visual imagination capabilities. Specifically, we leverage two complementary
types of ''imaginations'': (i) recalling existing images through retrieval and
(ii) synthesizing nonexistent images via text-to-image generation. Jointly
exploiting the language inputs and the imagination, a pretrained
vision-language model (e.g., CLIP) eventually composes a zero-shot solution to
the original language tasks. Notably, fueling language models with imagination
can effectively leverage visual knowledge to solve plain language tasks. In
consequence, Z-LaVI consistently improves the zero-shot performance of existing
language models across a diverse set of language tasks.

the absence of task indicators. Robust RL has been applied to deal with task

worst-case (robustness) and average performance, we propose Group
Distributionally Robust Markov Decision Process (GDR-MDP), a flexible
hierarchical MDP formulation that encodes task groups via a latent mixture
model. GDR-MDP identifies the optimal policy that maximizes the expected return
under the worst-possible qualified belief over task groups within an ambiguity
set. We rigorously show that GDR-MDP's hierarchical structure improves
distributional robustness by adding regularization to the worst possible
outcomes. We then develop deep RL algorithms for GDR-MDP for both value-based
and policy-based RL methods. Extensive experiments on Box2D control tasks,
MuJoCo benchmarks, and Google football platforms show that our algorithms
outperform classic robust training algorithms across diverse environments in
terms of robustness under belief uncertainties. Demos are available on our

of global information. We propose the GSM-DeGroot model, a new two-layer
agent-based opinion formation model that captures the coupled dynamics between
agent-to-agent local interactions and the GSM's steering effect. This way,
agents are subject to the effects of a DeGroot-like local opinion propagation,
as well as to a wide variety of possible aggregated information that can affect
their opinions, such as trending news feeds, press coverage, polls, elections,
etc. The cornerstone feature of our model that, contrary to the standard
DeGroot model, allows polarization to emerge, is the differential way in which
agents react to the global information. We explore numerically the model
dynamics to find regimes of qualitatively different behavior, using simulations
on synthetic data. Moreover, we challenge our model by fitting it to the
dynamics of real topics, related to protests, social movements, and the
escalation of a long geopolitical conflict to a war, which attracted the public
attention and were recorded on Twitter. Our experiments show that the proposed

of similar luminosity observed by ALMA. The new ALMA data confirm the disk is
very close to edge-on, as shown previously in scattered light images. We use
radiative transfer modeling to constrain the physical properties of dust and
gas disks. The dust density peaks at around 31~au and has a smooth outer edge
that extends out to $\sim70$~au. Interestingly, the dust emission is marginally
resolved along the minor axis, which indicates that it is vertically thick if
truly close to edge-on with an aspect ratio between 0.13 and 0.28. We also find
that the CO gas distribution is more compact than the dust \ah{(similarly to
the disk around 49 Ceti)}, which could be due to a low viscosity and a higher
gas release rate at small radii. Using simulations of the gas evolution taking
into account the CO photodissociation, shielding, and viscous evolution, we
find that HD~110058's CO gas mass and distribution are consistent with a

introduced in Fiedorowicz et al. (2022). KaRMMa is a full-sky Bayesian
algorithm for reconstructing weak lensing mass maps from shear data. It
forward-models the convergence field as a realization of a lognormal field. The
corresponding shear map is calculated using the standard Kaiser-Squires
transformation, and compared to observations at the field level. The posterior
distribution of maps given the shear data is sampled using Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo chains. Our work improves on the original algorithm by making it
numerically efficient, enabling full-sky reconstructions at $\approx$ 7 arcmin
resolution with modest computational resources. These gains are made with no
loss in accuracy or precision relative to KaRMMa 1.0. We compare the KaRMMa 2.0
posteriors against simulations across a variety of summary statistics
(one-point function, two-point functions, and peak/void counts) to demonstrate
our updated algorithm provides an accurate reconstruction of the convergence
field at mildly non-linear scales. Unsurprisingly, the lognormal model fails as
we approach non-linear scales ($\ell \gtrsim 200$), which in turn biases the
map posteriors. These biases are at the 2% level in the recovered power
spectrum, and at the 5% to 15% level for other statistics, depending on the
resolution.

research, where many data augmentation approaches for source code (e.g.,
semantic-preserving program transformation) are proposed to learn better
representations. However, these augmentations are at the raw-data level, which
requires additional code analysis in the preprocessing stage and additional
training costs in the training stage. In this paper, we explore augmentation
methods that augment data (both code and query) at representation level which
does not require additional data processing and training, and based on this we
propose a general format of representation-level augmentation that unifies
existing methods. Then, we propose three new augmentation methods (linear
extrapolation, binary interpolation, and Gaussian scaling) based on the general

augmentation methods over traditional contrastive learning methods on code

to the formation and evolution of these systems through their gravitational
wave emission. Combining events to infer the astrophysical distribution of
black hole spins allows us to determine the relative contribution from
different formation scenarios to the population. Many previous works have
modeled spin population distributions using parametric models. While these are
valuable approaches when the observed population is small, they make strong
assumptions about the shape of the underlying distribution and are highly
susceptible to biases due to mismodeling. The results obtained with such
parametric models are only valid if the allowed shape of the distribution is
well-motivated (i.e. for astrophysical reasons). In this work, we relax these
prior assumptions and model the spin distributions using a more data-driven
approach, modeling these distributions with flexible cubic spline interpolants
in order to allow for capturing structures that the parametric models cannot.
We find that adding this flexibility to the model substantially increases the
uncertainty in the inferred distributions, but find a general trend for lower
support at high spin magnitude and a spin tilt distribution consistent with
isotropic orientations. We infer that 62 - 87% of black holes have spin
magnitudes less than a = 0.5, and 27- 50% of black holes exhibit negative
$\chi_{\rm eff}$. Using the inferred $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution, we place a
conservative upper limit of 37% for the contribution of hierarchical mergers to
the astrophysical BBH population. Additionally, we find that artifacts from
unconverged Monte Carlo integrals in the likelihood can manifest as spurious
peaks and structures in inferred distributions, mandating the use of a
sufficient number of samples when using Monte Carlo integration for population
inference.

an optimal tree structure for a given discrete metric space, so that the

ultrametric spaces. This helps define different tree structures and allows us
to optimize the tree structure via projected gradient decent over space of

such distributions has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated
that the neural networks with modular structures including fast and slow
modules effectively represented the prior distribution in performing accurate
Bayesian inferences. Using a recurrent neural network consisting of a main
module connected with input and output layers and a sub-module connected only
with the main module and having slower neural activity, we demonstrated that
the modular network with distinct time scales performed more accurate Bayesian
inference compared with the neural networks with uniform time scales. Prior
information was represented selectively by the slow sub-module, which could
integrate observed signals over an appropriate period and represent input means
and variances. Accordingly, the network could effectively predict the
time-varying inputs. Furthermore, by training the time scales of neurons
starting from networks with uniform time scales and without modular structure,
the above slow-fast modular network structure spontaneously emerged as a result
of learning wherein prior information was selectively represented in the slower

symmetries, which grows a policy for each group of equivalent tasks instead of
a single task. We introduce a PPO-based RL algorithm with an invariant feature
extractor and a novel task grouping mechanism based on invariant features. We
test our algorithm in realistic autonomous driving scenarios, where each group
is associated with a map configuration. We show that our algorithm assigns
tasks to different groups with high accuracy and outperforms baselines in terms
of generalization capability by a large margin.

tasks involving quantitative computations, recognizing regular expressions and
reasoning over strings. We find that pretrained models significantly outperform
comparable non-pretrained neural models. This remains true also in experiments
with training non-pretrained models with fewer parameters to account for model
regularization effects. We further explore the effect of text domain on LMs by
pretraining models from text from different domains and provenances. Our

multiple source groups. Studies of human genetic admixture frequently estimate
ancestry components corresponding to fractions of individual genomes that trace
to specific ancestral populations. However, the same numerical ancestry
fraction can represent a wide array of admixture scenarios. Using a mechanistic
model of admixture, we characterize admixture genealogically: how many distinct
ancestors from the source populations does the admixture represent? We consider
African Americans, for whom continent-level estimates produce a 75-85% value
for African ancestry on average and 15-25% for European ancestry. Genetic
studies together with key features of African-American demographic history
suggest ranges for model parameters. Using the model, we infer that if
genealogical lineages of a random African American born during 1960-1965 are
traced back until they reach members of source populations, the expected number
of genealogical lines terminating with African individuals is 314, and the
expected number terminating in Europeans is 51. Across discrete generations,
the peak number of African genealogical ancestors occurs for birth cohorts from
the early 1700s. The probability exceeds 50% that at least one European
ancestor was born more recently than 1835. Our genealogical perspective can
contribute to further understanding the admixture processes that underlie
admixed populations. For African Americans, the results provide insight both on
how many of the ancestors of a typical African American might have been
forcibly displaced in the Transatlantic Slave Trade and on how many separate
European admixture events might exist in a typical African-American genealogy.

stakeholders expect its decarbonization through digitalization. But no
quantified evidence has been brought to date. We propose the first
environmental quantification of the impact of Building Information Modeling
(BIM) in the construction sector. Specifically, the direct and indirect
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by a monofunctional BIM to plan road
maintenance, a Pavement Management System (PMS), are evaluated using field data
from France. The related carbon footprints are calculated following a life
cycle approach, using different sources of data, including ecoinvent v3.6, and
the IPCC 2013 GWP 100a characterization factors. Three design-build-maintain
pavement alternatives are compared: scenario 1 relates to a massive design and
surface maintenance, scenario 2 to a progressive design and pre-planned
structural maintenance, and scenario 3 to a progressive design and tailored
structural maintenance supported by the PMS. First, results show negligible
direct emissions due to the PMS existence: 0.02% of the life cycle emissions of
scenario 3. Second, complementary sensitivity analyses show that using a PMS is
climate-positive over the life cycle when pavement subgrade bearing capacity
improves over time, and climate-neutral otherwise. The GHG emissions savings
using BIM can reach up to 30% of the life cycle emissions compared to other
scenarios, and 65% when restraining the scope to maintenance and rehabilitation
and excluding original pavement construction. Third, the neutral effect of BIM
in case of a deterioration of the bearing capacity of the subgrade may be
explained by design practices and safety margins, that could be enhanced using
BIM. Fourth, the decarbonization potential of a multifunctional BIM is
discussed, and research perspectives are presented.

been analyzed via Taylor expansion approach. Based on the analysis, theoretical
optimal values of the parameters are obtained in nonstationary environments.
Considering that the trace controller in the proportionate matrix implies a
trade-off between speed of convergence and final misadjustment, we further
propose an adaptive convex combination of two PRMCC filters (CPRMCC).
Analytical expressions are derived showing that the method performs at least as

develop transferable recommender systems. The basic idea is to employ
pre-trained language models~(PLM) to encode item text into item
representations. Despite the promising transferability, the binding between
item text and item representations might be too tight, leading to potential
problems such as over-emphasizing the effect of text features and exaggerating
the negative impact of domain gap. To address this issue, this paper proposes
VQ-Rec, a novel approach to learning Vector-Quantized item representations for
transferable sequential Recommenders. The main novelty of our approach lies in
the new item representation scheme: it first maps item text into a vector of
discrete indices (called item code), and then employs these indices to lookup
the code embedding table for deriving item representations. Such a scheme can
be denoted as ""text $\Longrightarrow$ code $\Longrightarrow$ representation"".
Based on this representation scheme, we further propose an enhanced contrastive
pre-training approach, using semi-synthetic and mixed-domain code
representations as hard negatives. Furthermore, we design a new cross-domain
fine-tuning method based on a differentiable permutation-based network.

effectiveness of the proposed approach, in both cross-domain and cross-platform
settings. Code and pre-trained model are available at:

Time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements of echolocation clicks emitted

tracking in 3-D. We propose a data processing chain that automatically detects
and tracks multiple odontocetes in 3-D from their echolocation clicks. First,
TDOA measurements are extracted with a generalized cross-correlation that
whitens received acoustic signals based on instrument noise statistics.
Subsequently, odontocetes are tracked in the TDOA domain using a graph-based
multi-target tracking (MTT) method to reject false TDOA measurements and close
gaps of missed detections. The resulting TDOA estimates are then used by
another graph-based MTT stage that estimates odontocete tracks in 3-D. The
tracking capability of the proposed data processing chain is demonstrated on
real acoustic data provided by two volumetric hydrophone arrays that recorded
echolocation clicks from Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris).

usual counting argument for the recurrence relation. The labeling scheme also
exhibits how the substitution rules arise in the construction of the

  polynomials on peaks and runs can be dealt with in two ways, combinatorially
or grammatically. The grammar also serves as a guideline to build a bijection
between permutations and increasing trees that maps the number of up-down runs
to the number of nonroot vertices of even degree. This correspondence can be
adapted to left peaks and exterior peaks, and the key step of the construction
is called the reflection principle.

sentences from the premise, and reads to estimate its credibility. Then the

peaks, [Fe/H] $\sim$ $-$0.72 and $-$0.92 dex, where the metal-poor components
occupy $\sim$ 13% of the total RGB stars. The metal-poor populations are more
significantly centrally concentrated than the metal-rich populations, showing a

calculating global attention brings another disadvantage compared with
convolutional neural networks, i.e. requiring much more data and computations
to converge, which makes it difficult to generalize well on small datasets,
which is common in practical applications. Previous works are either focusing
on transferring knowledge from large datasets or adjusting the structure for
small datasets. After carefully examining the self-attention modules, we
discover that the number of trivial attention weights is far greater than the
important ones and the accumulated trivial weights are dominating the attention
in Vision Transformers due to their large quantity, which is not handled by the
attention itself. This will cover useful non-trivial attention and harm the
performance when trivial attention includes more noise, e.g. in shallow layers
for some backbones. To solve this issue, we proposed to divide attention
weights into trivial and non-trivial ones by thresholds, then Suppressing

death-expectancy in COVID-19, and the effective determination of relevant
biomarkers on large sample-groups are important to reduce mortality. This study
aimed to reveal the routine blood-value predictors of COVID-19 mortality and to
determine the lethal-risk levels of these predictors during the disease
process. The dataset of the study consists of 38 routine blood-values of 2597
patients who died (n = 233) and those who recovered (n = 2364) from COVID-19 in
August-December, 2021. In this study, the histogram-based gradient-boosting
(HGB) model was the most successful machine-learning classifier in detecting
living and deceased COVID-19 patients (with squared F1 metrics F1^2 = 1). The
most efficient binary combinations with procalcitonin were obtained with
D-dimer, ESR, D-Bil and ferritin. The HGB model operated with these feature
pairs correctly detected almost all of the patients who survived and those who
died (precision > 0.98, recall > 0.98, F1^2 > 0.98). Furthermore, in the HGB
model operated with a single feature, the most efficient features were
procalcitonin (F1^2 = 0.96) and ferritin (F1^2 = 0.91). In addition, according
to the two-threshold approach, ferritin values between 376.2 mkg/L and 396.0
mkg/L (F1^2 = 0.91) and pro-calcitonin values between 0.2 mkg/L and 5.2 mkg/L
(F1^2 = 0.95) were found to be fatal risk levels for COVID-19. Considering all
the results, we suggest that many features combined with these features,
especially procalcitonin and ferritin, operated with the HGB model, can be used
to achieve very successful results in the classification of those who live, and
those who die from COVID-19. Moreover, we strongly recommend that clinicians
consider the critical levels we have found for procalcitonin and ferritin
properties, to reduce the lethality of the COVID-19 disease.

quantum resources (i.e., qubits) to users. In quantum cloud computing, quantum
cloud providers provision quantum resources in reservation and on-demand plans
for users. Literally, the cost of quantum resources in the reservation plan is
expected to be cheaper than the cost of quantum resources in the on-demand
plan. However, quantum resources in the reservation plan have to be reserved in
advance without information about the requirement of quantum circuits
beforehand, and consequently, the resources are insufficient, i.e.,
under-reservation. Hence, quantum resources in the on-demand plan can be used
to compensate for the unsatisfied quantum resources required. To end this, we
propose a quantum resource allocation for the quantum cloud computing system in
which quantum resources and the minimum waiting time of quantum circuits are
jointly optimized. Particularly, the objective is to minimize the total costs
of quantum circuits under uncertainties regarding qubit requirement and minimum
waiting time of quantum circuits. In experiments, practical circuits of quantum
Fourier transform are applied to evaluate the proposed qubit resource
allocation. The results illustrate that the proposed qubit resource allocation
can achieve the optimal total costs.

discriminative local details is quite essential. In this paper, we propose a
Task-aware Dual Similarity Network(TDSNet), which applies global features and
local patches to achieve better performance. Specifically, a local feature
enhancement module is adopted to activate the features with strong
discriminability. Besides, task-aware attention exploits the important patches
among the entire task. Finally, both the class prototypes obtained by global
features and discriminative local patches are employed for prediction.
Extensive experiments on three fine-grained datasets demonstrate that the

results on multiple choice question answering (MCQA) tasks in the zero, one,

(SOTA). MCQA tasks have traditionally been presented to LLMs like cloze tasks.
An LLM is conditioned on a question (without the associated answer options) and
its chosen option is the one assigned the highest probability after
normalization (for length, etc.). A more natural prompting approach is to
present the question and answer options to the LLM jointly and have it output
the symbol (e.g., ""A"") associated with its chosen answer option. This approach
allows the model to explicitly compare answer options, reduces computational
costs, and mitigates the effects of tokenization scheme and answer option
representations on answer selection. For the natural approach to be effective,
the LLM it is used with must be able to associate answer options with the
symbols that represent them. The LLM needs what we term multiple choice symbol
binding (MCSB) ability. This ability varies greatly by model. We show that a
model with high MCSB ability performs much better with the natural approach

closes the gap with the SOTA, suggesting that the MCQA ability of LLMs has been

prefer a porous silicate dust model without micron-sized large grains. The
pyroxene mass fraction and the crystallinity are overall consistent with but

The pyroxene-poor composition, small dust size and high porosity are similar to

  Medical Images",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the public
health burden and brought profound disaster to humans. For the particularity of
the COVID-19 medical images with blurred boundaries, low contrast and different
sizes of infection sites, some researchers have improved the segmentation
accuracy by adding model complexity. However, this approach has severe
limitations. Increasing the computational complexity and the number of
parameters is unfavorable for model transfer from laboratory to clinic.
Meanwhile, the current COVID-19 infections segmentation DCNN-based methods only
apply to a single modality. To solve the above issues, this paper proposes a
symmetric Encoder-Decoder segmentation framework named MS-DCANet. We introduce
Tokenized MLP block, a novel attention scheme that uses a shift-window
mechanism similar to the Transformer to acquire self-attention and achieve
local-to-global semantic dependency. MS-DCANet also uses several Dual Channel
blocks and a Res-ASPP block to expand the receptive field and extract
multi-scale features. On multi-modality COVID-19 tasks, MS-DCANet achieved
state-of-the-art performance compared with other U-shape models. It can well
trade off the accuracy and complexity. To prove the strong generalization
ability of our proposed model, we apply it to other tasks (ISIC 2018 and BAA)
and achieve satisfactory results.

of a temperature field in a strongly stratified and rotating environment.
Besides its relevance to geophysics, SQG bears formal resemblance with various
flows of interest for turbulence studies, from passive scalar and Burgers to
incompressible fluids in two and three dimensions. This analogy is here
substantiated by considering the turbulent SQG regime emerging from
deterministic and smooth initial data prescribed by the superposition of a few
Fourier modes. While still unsettled in the inviscid case, the initial value
problem is known to be mathematically well-posed when regularised by a small
viscosity. In practice, numerics reveal that in the presence of viscosity, a
turbulent regime appears in finite time, which features three of the
distinctive anomalies usually observed in three-dimensional developed
turbulence: (i) dissipative anomaly, (ii) multifractal scaling, and (iii)
super-diffusive separation of fluid particles, both backward and forward in
time. These three anomalies point towards three spontaneously broken symmetries
in the vanishing viscosity limit: scale invariance, time reversal and
uniqueness of the Lagrangian flow, a fascinating phenomenon that Krzysztof
Gawedzki dubbed spontaneous stochasticity. In the light of Gawedzki's work on
the passive scalar problem, we argue that spontaneous stochasticity and
irreversibility are intertwined in SQG, and provide numerical evidence for this
connection. Our numerics, though, reveal that the deterministic SQG setting
only features a tempered version of spontaneous stochasticity, characterised in
particular by non-universal statistics.

confounders in the training data, can learn spurious correlations and fail to
generalize when deployed. For image classifiers, augmenting a training dataset
using counterfactual examples has been empirically shown to break spurious
correlations. However, the counterfactual generation task itself becomes more
difficult as the level of confounding increases. Existing methods for
counterfactual generation under confounding consider a fixed set of
interventions (e.g., texture, rotation) and are not flexible enough to capture
diverse data-generating processes. Given a causal generative process, we
formally characterize the adverse effects of confounding on any downstream
tasks and show that the correlation between generative factors (attributes) can
be used to quantitatively measure confounding between generative factors. To
minimize such correlation, we propose a counterfactual generation method that
learns to modify the value of any attribute in an image and generate new images
given a set of observed attributes, even when the dataset is highly confounded.
These counterfactual images are then used to regularize the downstream
classifier such that the learned representations are the same across various
generative factors conditioned on the class label. Our method is
computationally efficient, simple to implement, and works well for any number
of generative factors and confounding variables. Our experimental results on
both synthetic (MNIST variants) and real-world (CelebA) datasets show the
usefulness of our approach.

features, S2WAT can leverage proven techniques in other fields of computer
vision, such as feature pyramid networks (FPN) or U-Net, to image style
transfer in future works. However, the existing window-based Transformers will
cause a problem that the stylized images will be grid-like when introduced into
image style transfer directly. To solve this problem, we propose S2WAT whose
representation is computed with Strips Window Attention (SpW Attention). The
SpW Attention can integrate both local information and long-range dependencies
in horizontal and vertical directions by a novel feature fusion scheme named
Attn Merge. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that S2WAT
achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art CNN-based, Flow-based, and
Transformer-based approaches. The code and models are available at

Owning to the great success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), many approaches
adopting GNNs for fraud detection has been gaining momentum. However, most
existing methods are based on the strong inductive bias of homophily, which
indicates that the context neighbors tend to have same labels or similar
features. In real scenarios, fraudsters often engage in camouflage behaviors in
order to avoid detection system. Therefore, the homophilic assumption no longer
holds, which is known as the inconsistency problem. In this paper, we argue
that the performance degradation is mainly attributed to the inconsistency
between topology and attribute. To address this problem, we propose to
disentangle the fraud network into two views, each corresponding to topology
and attribute respectively. Then we propose a simple and effective method that
uses the attention mechanism to adaptively fuse two views which captures
data-specific preference. In addition, we further improve it by introducing
mutual information constraints for topology and attribute. To this end, we
propose a Disentangled Information Graph Neural Network (DIGNN) model, which
utilizes variational bounds to find an approximate solution to our proposed
optimization objective function. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model can significantly outperform stateof-the-art baselines on real-world

distortion-free images in NEDs, it is necessary to establish a pixel-by-pixel
correspondence between the viewpoint and the displayed image. Designing compact
and wide-FoV NEDs requires complex optical designs. In such designs, the
displayed images are subject to gaze-contingent, non-linear geometric
distortions, which explicit geometric models can be difficult to represent or
computationally intensive to optimize.
  To solve these problems, we propose Neural Distortion Field (NDF), a
fully-connected deep neural network that implicitly represents display surfaces
complexly distorted in spaces. NDF takes spatial position and gaze direction as
input and outputs the display pixel coordinate and its intensity as perceived
in the input gaze direction. We synthesize the distortion map from a novel
viewpoint by querying points on the ray from the viewpoint and computing a
weighted sum to project output display coordinates into an image. Experiments
showed that NDF calibrates an augmented reality NED with 90$^{\circ}$ FoV with
about 3.23 pixel (5.8 arcmin) median error using only 8 training viewpoints.
Additionally, we confirmed that NDF calibrates more accurately than the
non-linear polynomial fitting, especially around the center of the FoV.

  Engagement Forecasting in Online Professional Social Platforms","10 pages, Accepted by WSDM'23",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  User engagement prediction plays a critical role for designing interaction
strategies to grow user engagement and increase revenue in online social
platforms. Through the in-depth analysis of the real-world data from the
world's largest professional social platforms, i.e., LinkedIn, we find that
users expose diverse engagement patterns, and a major reason for the
differences in user engagement patterns is that users have different intents.
That is, people have different intents when using LinkedIn, e.g., applying for
jobs, building connections, or checking notifications, which shows quite
different engagement patterns. Meanwhile, user intents and the corresponding
engagement patterns may change over time. Although such pattern differences and
dynamics are essential for user engagement prediction, differentiating user
engagement patterns based on user dynamic intents for better user engagement
forecasting has not received enough attention in previous works. In this paper,
we proposed a Dynamic Intent Guided Meta Network (DIGMN), which can explicitly
model user intent varying with time and perform differentiated user engagement
forecasting. Specifically, we derive some interpretable basic user intents as
prior knowledge from data mining and introduce prior intents in explicitly
modeling dynamic user intent. Furthermore, based on the dynamic user intent
representations, we propose a meta predictor to perform differentiated user
engagement forecasting. Through a comprehensive evaluation on LinkedIn
anonymous user data, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
significantly, i.e., 2.96% and 3.48% absolute error reduction, on
coarse-grained and fine-grained user engagement prediction tasks, respectively,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

a noisy training mechanism which considers each parameter's importance in the
downstream task to help fine-tune PLMs. The main idea of PATS is to add bigger
noise to parameters with lower sensitivity and vice versa, in order to activate
more parameters' contributions to downstream tasks without affecting the
sensitive ones much. Extensive experiments conducted on different tasks of the
GLUE benchmark show PATS can consistently empower the fine-tuning of different

more concentrated distributions of sensitivities, which experimentally proves
the effectiveness of our method.

therefore to drive the performance of mid-infrared high-contrast imaging modes

dispersion relations for waves propagating in the string interior and are

construct a unified framework with which to study and interpret the internal

simple physically intuitive coordinate system, without the need for dimensional
reduction or approximate effective actions. This, in turn, allows us to
identify the precise conditions under which higher-dimensional strings and

multimodality in the latent representations of HRI tasks, allowing us to decode
the varying dynamics occurring in such tasks. Compared to related work, MILD
generates more accurate trajectories for the controlled agent (robot) when
conditioned on the observed agent's (human) trajectory. Notably, MILD can learn
directly from camera-based pose estimations to generate trajectories, which we
then map to a humanoid robot without the need for any additional training.

spectrometer (MS) ALICE is implementing new hardware and software solutions.
The installation of a new vertex tracker, the Muon Forward Tracker (MFT), in

It will allow one to separate, for the first time in ALICE in the
forward-rapidity region, the prompt and non-prompt contributions to the

the MFT with those in the MS will add vertexing capabilities covering a broad

invariant mass resolution, allowing for a better separation of the J/psi and
psi(2S) states. In addition, the front-end and readout electronics of the muon

of substances, combined with deep learning algorithms, has been widely used in
food detection. However, in real scenarios, acquiring and labeling spectral
data is an extremely labor-intensive task, which makes it impossible to provide
enough high-quality data for training efficient supervised deep learning
models. To better leverage limited samples, we apply pre-training & fine-tuning
paradigm to the field of spectral detection for the first time and propose a
pre-training method of deep bidirectional transformers for spectral
classification of Chinese liquors, abbreviated as Spectrum-BERT. Specifically,
first, to retain the model's sensitivity to the characteristic peak position
and local information of the spectral curve, we innovatively partition the
curve into multiple blocks and obtain the embeddings of different blocks, as
the feature input for the next calculation. Second, in the pre-training stage,
we elaborately design two pre-training tasks, Next Curve Prediction (NCP) and
Masked Curve Model (MCM), so that the model can effectively utilize unlabeled
samples to capture the potential knowledge of spectral data, breaking the
restrictions of the insufficient labeled samples, and improving the
applicability and performance of the model in practical scenarios. Finally, we
conduct a large number of experiments on the real liquor spectral dataset. In
the comparative experiments, the proposed Spectrum-BERT significantly
outperforms the baselines in multiple metrics and this advantage is more
significant on the imbalanced dataset. Moreover, in the parameter sensitivity
experiment, we also analyze the model performance under different parameter
settings, to provide a reference for subsequent research.

expectancies for males and females in England and Wales have slowed down. In
this paper, cause-specific mortality data for England and Wales from 2001 to
2018 are used to investigate the cause-specific contributions to the slowdown
in improvements. Cause-specific death counts in England and Wales are modelled
using negative binomial regression and a breakpoint in the linear temporal
trend in log mortality rates is investigated. Cause-specific scenarios are
generated, where the post-breakpoint temporal trends for certain causes are
reverted to pre-breakpoint rates and the effect of these changes on
age-standardised mortality rates and period life expectancies is explored.
These scenarios are used to quantify cause-specific contributions to the
mortality improvement slowdown. Reductions in improvements at older ages in
circulatory system diseases, as well as the worsening of mortality rates due to
mental and behavioural disorders and nervous system diseases, provide the
greatest contributions to the reduction of improvements in age-standardised
mortality rates and period life expectancies. Future period life expectancies
scenarios are also generated, where cause-specific mortality rate trends are
assumed to either persist or be reverted. In the majority of scenarios, the
reversion of cause-specific mortality trends in a single cause of death results
in the worsening of period life expectancies at birth and age 65 for both males
and females. This work enhances the understanding of cause-specific
contributions to the slowdown in all-cause mortality rate improvements from
2001 to 2018, while also providing insights into causes of death that are

console as a heterogeneous transfer benchmark for deep reinforcement learning
agents. Game designers created curricula using combinations of several discrete
modifications to the basic versions of games such as Space Invaders, Breakout
and Freeway, making them progressively more challenging for human players. By
formally organising these modifications into several factors of variation, we
are able to show that Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) are a potent tool for
studying the effects of human-relevant domain changes on the learning and
transfer performance of a deep reinforcement learning agent. Since no manual
task engineering is needed on our part, leveraging the original multi-factorial
design avoids the pitfalls of unintentionally biasing the experimental setup.
We find that game design factors have a large and statistically significant
impact on an agent's ability to learn, and so do their combinatorial
interactions. Furthermore, we show that zero-shot transfer from the basic games
to their respective variations is possible, but the variance in performance is
also largely explained by interactions between factors. As such, we argue that
Atari game curricula offer a challenging benchmark for transfer learning in RL,
that can help the community better understand the generalisation capabilities
of RL agents along dimensions which meaningfully impact human generalisation
performance. As a start, we report that value-function finetuning of regularly

significant headroom for algorithmic innovation remains. We conclude with the
observation that selective transfer from multiple variants could further
improve performance.

  Video-Grounded Dialogue Generation","To appear at EMNLP 2022 findings",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  We study video-grounded dialogue generation, where a response is generated
based on the dialogue context and the associated video. The primary challenges
of this task lie in (1) the difficulty of integrating video data into
pre-trained language models (PLMs) which presents obstacles to exploiting the
power of large-scale pre-training; and (2) the necessity of taking into account
the complementarity of various modalities throughout the reasoning process.
Although having made remarkable progress in video-grounded dialogue generation,
existing methods still fall short when it comes to integrating with PLMs in a
way that allows information from different modalities to complement each other.
To alleviate these issues, we first propose extracting pertinent information
from videos and turning it into reasoning paths that are acceptable to PLMs.
Additionally, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning method to
collaboratively perform reasoning on different modalities (i.e., video and
dialogue context). Empirical experiment results on two public datasets indicate
that the proposed model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art models by
large margins on both automatic and human evaluations.

  Interpretable Latent Structure","To appear at EMNLP 2022 main conference",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  With the availability of massive general-domain dialogue data, pre-trained
dialogue generation appears to be super appealing to transfer knowledge from
the general domain to downstream applications. In most existing work, such
transferable ability is mainly obtained by fitting a large model with hundreds
of millions of parameters on massive data in an exhaustive way, leading to
inefficient running and poor interpretability. This paper proposes a novel
dialogue generation model with a latent structure that is easily transferable
from the general domain to downstream tasks in a lightweight and transparent
way. Experiments on two benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed
model. Thanks to the transferable latent structure, our model is able to yield
better dialogue responses than four strong baselines in terms of both automatic
and human evaluations, and our model with about 22% parameters particularly
delivers a 5x speedup in running time compared with the strongest baseline.
Moreover, the proposed model is explainable by interpreting the discrete latent
variables.

step in achieving excess returns over market benchmarks. Both academia and
industry are striving to find new factors that have good explanatory power for
future stock returns and good stability of their predictive power. In practice,
factor investing is still largely based on linear multi-factor models, although
many deep learning methods show promising results compared to traditional
methods in stock trend prediction and portfolio risk management. However, the
existing non-linear methods have two drawbacks: 1) there is a lack of
interpretation of the newly discovered factors, 2) the financial insights
behind the mining process are unclear, making practitioners reluctant to apply
the existing methods to factor investing. To address these two shortcomings, we
develop a novel deep multi-factor model that adopts industry neutralization and
market neutralization modules with clear financial insights, which help us
easily build a dynamic and multi-relational stock graph in a hierarchical
structure to learn the graph representation of stock relationships at different
levels, e.g., industry level and universal level. Subsequently, graph attention
modules are adopted to estimate a series of deep factors that maximize the
cumulative factor returns. And a factor-attention module is developed to
approximately compose the estimated deep factors from the input factors, as a
way to interpret the deep factors explicitly. Extensive experiments on
real-world stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of our deep
multi-factor model in the task of factor investing.

\emph{direction-(near)-critical} and their full classification is still open.
To date, there are four known infinite families and over 100 sporadic critical

with at least 50 points belongs to those four infinite families. Interestingly,
except for a handful of sporadic configurations, all these configurations are
centrally symmetric. We prove Jamison's conjecture, and extend it to the
near-critical case, for centrally symmetric configurations in \emph{noncentral

results are proved in the more general setting of \emph{allowable sequences}.
We show that, up to equivalence, the \emph{central signature} of a set uniquely

Bansal's SDP algorithm for finding a coloring $x\in\{-1,1\}^n$ that
approximately minimizes the discrepancy $\mathrm{disc}(A,x) : = \| A x
\|_{\infty}$ of a general real-valued $m\times n$ matrix $A$. Larsen's
algorithm runs in $\widetilde{O}(mn^2)$ time compared to Bansal's
$\widetilde{O}(mn^{4.5})$-time algorithm, at the price of a slightly weaker
logarithmic approximation ratio in terms of the hereditary discrepancy of $A$
[Ban10].
  In this work we present a combinatorial $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{nnz}(A) +
n^3)$ time algorithm with the same approximation guarantee as Larsen, which is
optimal for tall matrices $m=\mathrm{poly}(n)$. Using a more intricate analysis
and fast matrix-multiplication, we achieve $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{nnz}(A) +
n^{2.53})$ time, which breaks cubic runtime for square matrices, and bypasses
the barrier of linear-programming approaches [ES14] for which input-sparsity
time is currently out of reach.
  Our algorithm relies on two main ideas: (i) A new sketching technique for
finding a projection matrix with short $\ell_2$-basis using implicit
leverage-score sampling; (ii) A data structure for faster implementation of the
iterative Edge-Walk partial-coloring algorithm of Lovett-Meka, using an
alternative analysis that enables ``lazy"" batch-updates with low-rank
corrections. Our result nearly closes the computational gap between real-valued

that it does not use the Irreversible Thermodynamic approach by analyzing no
thermodynamic forces that generate the fluxes under consideration. Instead, all
the regularities are derived on the basis of conservation and linearity
reasons. The terminology ""Kinematics of Fluxes"" is proposed for such an
analysis on the basis of the analogy with Mechanics where Kinematics deals with
regularities of motion by considering no mechanic forces. The only
thermodynamic steps of the analysis relate to the discussion on the partial
molar volumes of electrolyte and ions that are the equilibrium thermodynamic
parameters of the adjacent solutions. These parameters are important for
interrelating between the transmembrane fluxes of the solution components and
the transmembrane volume flow. The paper contains short literature reviews
concerned with the partial molar volumes of electrolyte and ions: the methods
of measurement, the obtained results and their theoretical interpretations. It
is concluded from the reviews that the classical theories should be corrected

series of numerical simulations of collapsing 1000 M$_\odot$ clumps taking into
account radiative feedback and magnetic field with spatial resolution down to 1
AU. Both ideal and non-ideal MHD runs are performed and various radiative
feedback efficiencies are considered. We also develop analytical models that we
confront to the numerical results. The sum of the luminosities produced by the
stars in the calculations is computed and it compares well with the bolometric
luminosities reported in observations of massive star forming clumps. The
temperatures, velocities and densities are also found to be in good agreement
with recent observations. The stellar mass spectrum inferred for the
simulations is, generally speaking, not strictly universal and in particular
varies with magnetic intensity. It is also influenced by the choice of the
radiative feedback efficiency. In all simulations, a sharp drop in the stellar
distribution is found at about $M_{min} \simeq$ 0.1 M$_\odot$, which is likely
a consequence of the adiabatic behaviour induced by dust opacities at high
densities. As a consequence, when the combination of magnetic and thermal
support is not too large, the mass distribution presents a peak located at
0.3-0.5 M$_\odot$. When magnetic and thermal support are large, the mass
distribution is better described by a plateau, i.e. $d N / d \log M \propto
M^{-\Gamma}$, $\Gamma \simeq 0$. Abridged

and exoplanetary atmospheres will rely on accurate molecular opacity data.
Here, we present the first comprehensive molecular line list of CaOH covering
the \A--\X\ rotation-vibration-electronic and \X--\X\ rotation-vibration bands.
The newly computed OYT6 line list contains over 24.2 billion transitions
between 3.2 million energy levels with rotational excitation up to $J=175.5$.
It is applicable to temperatures up to $T=3000$~K and covers the
0\,--\,35\,000~cm$^{-1}$ range (wavelengths $\lambda > 0.29$~$\mu$m) for
rotational, rotation-vibration and the \A--\X\ electronic transition. The
strong band around 16\,000~cm$^{-1}$ ($\lambda = 0.63$~$\mu$m) is likely to be
of interest in future astronomical observations, particularly in hot rocky
exoplanets where temperatures can become extremely high. The OYT6 line list has
been generated using empirically-refined \X\ and \A\ state potential energy
surfaces, high-level \textit{ab initio} transition dipole moment surfaces and a
rigorous treatment of both Renner-Teller and spin-orbit coupling effects, which
are necessary for correctly modelling the CaOH spectrum. Post-processing of the
CaOH line list has been performed so as to tailor it to high-resolution
applications, i.e.\ by replacing calculated energy levels with more accurate
empirically-derived values (where available), hence improving the accuracy of
the predicted line positions in certain regions. The OYT6 line list is
available from the ExoMol database at http://www.exomol.com and the CDS
astronomical database.

Metal-organic nanosheets (MONs) potentially overcome these limitations by
combining the benefits of MOFs with an atomically thin morphology of large

ZIF-7-III MONs via facile low-energy salt-templating. Employing guest@MOF

ZIF-7 nanosheets (Z7-NS) to form light emissive systems exhibiting intense and
highly photostable fluorescence. Aggregation and F\""orster resonance energy
transfer, enabled by the MON framework, were revealed as the mechanisms behind
fluorescence. By varying guest concentration, these mechanisms provided
predictable quantified control over emission chromaticity of a dual-guest Z7-NS
material and the definition of an 'emission chromaticity fingerprint' - a
unique subset of the visible spectrum which a material can emit by
fluorescence.

GEC-oriented parser (GOPar) using parallel GEC training data as a pivot. First,
we design an extended syntax representation scheme that allows us to represent
both grammatical errors and syntax in a unified tree structure. Then, we obtain
parse trees of the source incorrect sentences by projecting trees of the target
correct sentences. Finally, we train GOPar with such projected trees. For GEC,
we employ the graph convolution network to encode source-side syntactic
information produced by GOPar, and fuse them with the outputs of the
Transformer encoder. Experiments on mainstream English and Chinese GEC datasets
show that our proposed SynGEC approach consistently and substantially
outperforms strong baselines and achieves competitive performance. Our code and

  Federated Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model building among a large
number of participants without the need for explicit data sharing. But this
approach shows vulnerabilities when privacy inference attacks are applied to
it. In particular, in the event of a gradient leakage attack, which has a
higher success rate in retrieving sensitive data from the model gradients, FL
models are at higher risk due to the presence of communication in their
inherent architecture. The most alarming thing about this gradient leakage
attack is that it can be performed in such a covert way that it does not hamper
the training performance while the attackers backtrack from the gradients to
get information about the raw data. Two of the most common approaches proposed
as solutions to this issue are homomorphic encryption and adding noise with
differential privacy parameters. These two approaches suffer from two major
drawbacks. They are: the key generation process becomes tedious with the
increasing number of clients, and noise-based differential privacy suffers from
a significant drop in global model accuracy. As a countermeasure, we propose a
mixed-precision quantized FL scheme, and we empirically show that both of the
issues addressed above can be resolved. In addition, our approach can ensure
more robustness as different layers of the deep model are quantized with
different precision and quantization modes. We empirically proved the validity
of our method with three benchmark datasets and found a minimal accuracy drop
in the global model after applying quantization.

and test set share the same label space. While in many practical scenarios, it
is inevitable that some test samples belong to unknown classes (open-set). To
fix this issue, Open-Set Recognition (OSR), whose goal is to make correct
predictions on both close-set samples and open-set samples, has attracted
rising attention. In this direction, the vast majority of literature focuses on
the pattern of open-set samples. However, how to evaluate model performance in
this challenging task is still unsolved. In this paper, a systematic analysis
reveals that most existing metrics are essentially inconsistent with the
aforementioned goal of OSR: (1) For metrics extended from close-set
classification, such as Open-set F-score, Youden's index, and Normalized
Accuracy, a poor open-set prediction can escape from a low performance score
with a superior close-set prediction. (2) Novelty detection AUC, which measures
the ranking performance between close-set and open-set samples, ignores the
close-set performance. To fix these issues, we propose a novel metric named
OpenAUC. Compared with existing metrics, OpenAUC enjoys a concise pairwise
formulation that evaluates open-set performance and close-set performance in a
coupling manner. Further analysis shows that OpenAUC is free from the
aforementioned inconsistency properties. Finally, an end-to-end learning method
is proposed to minimize the OpenAUC risk, and the experimental results on
popular benchmark datasets speak to its effectiveness. Project Page:

neural network. Previous studies remedy this issue by adding a regularization
term to a loss function, preventing a model from making a peaked distribution.
Label smoothing smoothes target labels with a pre-defined prior label
distribution; as a result, a model is learned to maximize the likelihood of
predicting the soft label. Nonetheless, the amount of smoothing is the same in
all samples and remains fixed in training. In other words, label smoothing does
not reflect the change in probability distribution mapped by a model over the
course of training. To address this issue, we propose a regularization scheme
that brings dynamic nature into the smoothing parameter by taking model
probability distribution into account, thereby varying the parameter per
instance. A model in training self-regulates the extent of smoothing on the fly
during forward propagation. Furthermore, inspired by recent work in bridging
label smoothing and knowledge distillation, our work utilizes self-knowledge as
a prior label distribution in softening target labels, and presents theoretical
support for the regularization effect by knowledge distillation and the dynamic
smoothing parameter. Our regularizer is validated comprehensively, and the
result illustrates marked improvements in model generalization and calibration,
enhancing robustness and trustworthiness of a model.

Neural Networks (GNNs). The limited representational power of MPNNs inspires
the study of provably powerful GNN architectures. However, knowing one model is
more powerful than another gives little insight about what functions they can
or cannot express. It is still unclear whether these models are able to
approximate specific functions such as counting certain graph substructures,
which is essential for applications in biology, chemistry and social network
analysis. Motivated by this, we propose to study the counting power of Subgraph
MPNNs, a recent and popular class of powerful GNN models that extract rooted
subgraphs for each node, assign the root node a unique identifier and encode
the root node's representation within its rooted subgraph. Specifically, we
prove that Subgraph MPNNs fail to count more-than-4-cycles at node level,
implying that node representations cannot correctly encode the surrounding
substructures like ring systems with more than four atoms. To overcome this
limitation, we propose I$^2$-GNNs to extend Subgraph MPNNs by assigning
different identifiers for the root node and its neighbors in each subgraph.
I$^2$-GNNs' discriminative power is shown to be strictly stronger than Subgraph
MPNNs and partially stronger than the 3-WL test. More importantly, I$^2$-GNNs
are proven capable of counting all 3, 4, 5 and 6-cycles, covering common
substructures like benzene rings in organic chemistry, while still keeping
linear complexity. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first linear-time

recent years. However, the increasing reliance on video calls provides
opportunities for new impersonation attacks by fraudsters using the advanced
real-time DeepFakes. Real-time DeepFakes pose new challenges to detection
methods, which have to run in real-time as a video call is ongoing. In this
paper, we describe a new active forensic method to detect real-time DeepFakes.
Specifically, we authenticate video calls by displaying a distinct pattern on
the screen and using the corneal reflection extracted from the images of the
call participant's face. This pattern can be induced by a call participant
displaying on a shared screen or directly integrated into the video-call
client. In either case, no specialized imaging or lighting hardware is
required. Through large-scale simulations, we evaluate the reliability of this
approach under a range in a variety of real-world imaging scenarios.

tool. The main goal is to classify the point of a region. The HIS contains more
than a hundred bidirectional measures, called bands (or simply images), of the
same region called Ground Truth Map (GT). Unfortunately, some bands contain
redundant information, others are affected by the noise, and the high
dimensionalities of features make the accuracy of classification lower. All
these bands can be important for some applications, but for the classification
a small subset of these is relevant. In this paper we use mutual information
(MI) to select the relevant bands; and the Normalized Mutual Information
coefficient to avoid and control redundant ones. This is a feature selection
scheme and a Filter strategy. We establish this study on HSI AVIRIS 92AV3C.

everything from individual molecules triggering complex metabolic cascades, to
animals using signals to alert their group to the presence of predators. When
communication involves common interest, simple sender-receiver games show how
reliable signaling can emerge and evolve to transmit information effectively.
These games have been analyzed extensively, with some work investigating the
role of static network structure on information transfer. However, no existing
work has examined the coevolution of strategy and network structure in
sender-receiver games. Here we show that coevolution is sufficient to generate
the endogenous formation of distinct groups from an initially homogeneous
population. It also allows for the emergence of novel ``hybrid'' signaling
groups that have not previously been considered or demonstrated in theory or
nature. Hybrid groups are composed of different complementary signaling
behaviors that rely on evolved network structure to achieve effective
communication. Without this structure, such groups would normally fail to
effectively communicate. Our findings pertain to all common interest signaling
games, are robust across many parameters, and mitigate known problems of
inefficient communication. Our work generates new insights for the theory of
adaptive behavior, signaling, and group formation in natural and social systems
across a wide range of environments in which changing network structure is
common. We discuss implications for research on metabolic networks, among
neurons, proteins, and social organisms.

the form of an operator ${\cal{D}}_1: F_0 \rightarrow F_1$. When ${\cal{D}}$ is
involutive, that is when the corresponding system $R_q=ker(\Phi)$ is
involutive, this procedure provides successive first order involutive operators
${\cal{D}}_1, ... , {\cal{D}}_n$ . Though ${\cal{D}}_1 \circ {\cal{D}}=0 $

in differential homological algebra. They may also depend on the parameters.
When $R_q$ is not involutive, a standard {\it prolongation/projection} (PP)
procedure allows in general to find integers $r,s$ such that the image
$R^{(s)}_{q+r}$ of the projection at order $q+r$ of the prolongation
${\rho}_{r+s}(R_q) = J_{r+s}(R_q) \cap J_{q+r+s}(E)\subset J_{r+s}(J_q(E)) $ is
involutive but it may highly depend on the parameters. However, sometimes the
resulting system no longer depends on the parameters and the extension modules
do not depend on the parameters because it is known that they do not depend on
the differential sequence used for their definition. The purpose of this paper
is to study the above problems for the Kerr $(m, a)$, Schwarzschild $(m, 0)$
and Minkowski $(0, 0)$ parameters while computing the dimensions of the

acceleration in deep neural networks (DNNs).Some research regarded filter
pruning as a combinatorial optimization problem and thus used evolutionary
algorithms (EA) to prune filters of DNNs. However, it is difficult to find a
satisfactory compromise solution in a reasonable time due to the complexity of
solution space searching. To solve this problem, we first formulate a
multi-objective optimization problem based on a sub-network of the full model
and propose a Sub-network Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (SMOEA) for
filter pruning. By progressively pruning the convolutional layers in groups,
SMOEA can obtain a lightweight pruned result with better
performance.Experiments on VGG-14 model for CIFAR-10 verify the effectiveness
of the proposed SMOEA. Specifically, the accuracy of the pruned model with
16.56% parameters decreases by 0.28% only, which is better than the widely used
popular filter pruning criteria.

  Pretrained Models in Speech Analysis","Accepted to IEEE SLT 2022",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Embedding paralinguistic properties is a challenging task as there are only a
few hours of training data available for domains such as emotional speech. One
solution to this problem is to pretrain a general self-supervised speech
representation model on large amounts of unlabeled speech. This pretrained
model is then finetuned to a specific task. Paralinguistic properties however
have notoriously high class variance, making the finetuning ineffective. In
this work, we propose a two step approach to this. First we improve the
embedding space, then we train an adapter to bridge the gap from the embedding
space to a classification task. In order to improve the class invariance we use
a combination of contrastive and non-contrastive losses to explicitly optimize
for class invariant, yet discriminative features. Our approach consistently
outperforms baselines that are finetuned end-to-end on multiple tasks and
surpasses a benchmark on state-of-the-art emotion classification.

  Isomorphisms",,,,,"math.RA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The standard definition of the dimension of a vector space or rank of a
module states that dimension or rank is equal to the cardinality of any basis,
which requires an understanding of the concepts of basis, generating set, and
linear independence. We pose new definitions for the dimension of a vector
space, called the isomorphic dimension, and for the rank of a module, called
the isomorphic rank, using isomorphisms. In the finite case, for a vector space
$V$ over field $F$, its isomorphic dimension is equal $n$ if and only if there
exists a linear isomorphism from $F^n$ to $V$. For a module $M$ over the
commutative ring $R$ with identity, its isomorphic rank is equal to $n$ if and
only if there exists an $R$-module isomorphism from $R^n$ to $M$. There are
similar definitions in the infinite cases. These isomorphic definitions do not
require the concepts of basis, generating set, and linear independence. This
approach allows for some fundamental linear algebra and module theory results
to be seen more easily or to be proven more similarly to other algebraic proofs
involving isomorphisms and homomorphisms and provides an alternate educational
approach to dimension and rank.
