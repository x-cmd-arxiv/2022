Cholesky QR factorization of a matrix $X$. Instead of computing the R factor
from $X^T X$, as is done by standard methods, we obtain it from a small,
efficiently computable random sketch of $X$, thus saving computational cost and
improving numerical stability. The proposed direct variant of the randomized
Cholesky QR requires only half the flops and the same communication cost as the
classical Cholesky QR. At the same time, it is more robust since it is
guaranteed to be stable whenever the input matrix is numerically full-rank. The
rank-revealing randomized Cholesky QR variant has the ability to sort out the
linearly dependent columns of $X$, which allows to have an unconditional
numerical stability and reduce the computational cost when $X$ is
rank-deficient. We also depict a column-oriented randomized Cholesky QR that
establishes the connection with the randomized Gram-Schmidt process, and a
reduced variant that outputs a low-dimensional projection of the Q factor
rather than the full factor and therefore yields drastic computational savings.
It is shown that performing minor operations in higher precision in the
proposed algorithms can allow stability with working unit roundoff independent
of the dominant matrix dimension. This feature may be of particular interest
for a QR factorization of tall-and-skinny matrices on low-precision
architectures.

samples (OOD reasoning), are necessary to ensure the safety of results
generated by machine learning models. Recently there have been promising
results for OOD detection in the latent space of variational autoencoders
(VAEs). However, without disentanglement, VAEs cannot perform OOD reasoning.
Disentanglement ensures a one- to-many mapping between generative factors of
OOD (e.g., rain in image data) and the latent variables to which they are
encoded. Although previous literature has focused on weakly-supervised
disentanglement on simple datasets with known and independent generative
factors. In practice, achieving full disentanglement through weak supervision
is impossible for complex datasets, such as Carla, with unknown and abstract
generative factors. As a result, we propose an OOD reasoning framework that
learns a partially disentangled VAE to reason about complex datasets. Our
framework consists of three steps: partitioning data based on observed
generative factors, training a VAE as a logic tensor network that satisfies
disentanglement rules, and run-time OOD reasoning. We evaluate our approach on
the Carla dataset and compare the results against three state-of-the-art
methods. We found that our framework outperformed these methods in terms of
disentanglement and end-to-end OOD reasoning.

relative safety, i.e., whether given a fixed database, the original query
evaluates to a finite relation. The second safe-range query is equivalent to
the original query, if the latter is relatively safe. We compose our
translation with other, more standard ones to ultimately obtain two SQL

computational resources. Video Swin Transformer (VST) is a pure-transformer
model developed for video classification which achieves state-of-the-art
results in accuracy and efficiency on several datasets. In this paper, we aim
to understand if VST generalizes well enough to be used in an out-of-domain
setting. We study the performance of VST on two large-scale datasets, namely
FCVID and Something-Something using a transfer learning approach from
Kinetics-400, which requires around 4x less memory than training from scratch.
We then break down the results to understand where VST fails the most and in
which scenarios the transfer-learning approach is viable. Our experiments show
an 85\% top-1 accuracy on FCVID without retraining the whole model which is
equal to the state-of-the-art for the dataset and a 21\% accuracy on
Something-Something. The experiments also suggest that the performance of the
VST decreases on average when the video duration increases which seems to be a
consequence of a design choice of the model. From the results, we conclude that
VST generalizes well enough to classify out-of-domain videos without retraining
when the target classes are from the same type as the classes used to train the
model. We observed this effect when we performed transfer-learning from
Kinetics-400 to FCVID, where most datasets target mostly objects. On the other
hand, if the classes are not from the same type, then the accuracy after the
transfer-learning approach is expected to be poor. We observed this effect when
we performed transfer-learning from Kinetics-400, where the classes represent
mostly objects, to Something-Something, where the classes represent mostly
actions.

several challenges one must overcome before unlocking their full potential. For
instance, models based on quantum neural networks (QNNs) can suffer from
excessive local minima and barren plateaus in their training landscapes.
Recently, the nascent field of geometric quantum machine learning (GQML) has
emerged as a potential solution to some of those issues. The key insight of
GQML is that one should design architectures, such as equivariant QNNs,
encoding the symmetries of the problem at hand. Here, we focus on problems with
permutation symmetry (i.e., the group of symmetry $S_n$), and show how to build
$S_n$-equivariant QNNs. We provide an analytical study of their performance,
proving that they do not suffer from barren plateaus, quickly reach
overparametrization, and generalize well from small amounts of data. To verify
our results, we perform numerical simulations for a graph state classification
task. Our work provides the first theoretical guarantees for equivariant QNNs,
thus indicating the extreme power and potential of GQML.

risk for speech recordings, without reference to demographic or metadata, using
a state-of-the-art speaker recognition system. We demonstrate that the risk is
inversely related to the number of comparisons an adversary must consider,
i.e., the search space. Risk is high for a small search space but drops as the
search space grows ($precision >0.85$ for $<1*10^{6}$ comparisons, $precision
<0.5$ for $>3*10^{6}$ comparisons). Next, we show that the nature of a speech

circuits employ superconducting components including single-photon detectors,
Josephson junctions, and transformers to achieve neuromorphic functions. To
date, all simulations of loop neurons have used first-principles circuit
analysis to model the behavior of synapses, dendrites, and neurons. These
circuit models are computationally inefficient and leave opaque the
relationship between loop neurons and other complex systems. Here we introduce
a modeling framework that captures the behavior of the relevant synaptic,
dendritic, and neuronal circuits at a phenomenological level without resorting
to full circuit equations. Within this compact model, each dendrite is
discovered to obey a single nonlinear leaky-integrator ordinary differential
equation, while a neuron is modeled as a dendrite with a thresholding element
and an additional feedback mechanism for establishing a refractory period. A
synapse is modeled as a single-photon detector coupled to a dendrite, where the
response of the single-photon detector follows a closed-form expression. We
quantify the accuracy of the phenomenological model relative to circuit
simulations and find that the approach reduces computational time by a factor
of ten thousand while maintaining accuracy of one part in ten thousand. We
demonstrate the use of the model with several basic examples. The net increase
in computational efficiency enables future simulation of large networks, while
the formulation provides a connection to a large body of work in applied
mathematics, computational neuroscience, and physical systems such as spin

contain hot gas with too high entropy in their cores. Additional simulations
run without artificial conduction, metal cooling or AGN feedback produce lower
entropy levels but still fail to reproduce observed profiles. Conversely, the
two objects run without supernova feedback show a significant entropy increase
which can be attributed to excessive cooling and star formation. Varying the
AGN heating temperature does not greatly affect the profile shape, but only the
overall normalisation. Finally, we compared runs with four AGN heating schemes

shaped by the interplay between gravity, radiation, and strong magnetic field,
which significantly affects the opacities of a plasma and radiative pressure
under such extreme conditions. Quantitative consideration of magnetic plasma
opacities is, therefore, an essential ingredient of any self-consistent
modeling of emission region structure of X-ray pulsars. We present results of
computations of the Rosseland and Planck mean opacities of a strongly
magnetized plasma with a simple chemical composition,namely the solar
hydrogen/helium mix. We consider all relevant specific opacities of the
magnetized plasma including vacuum polarization effect and contribution of
electron-positron pairs where the pair number density is computed in the
thermodynamic equilibrium approximation. The magnetic Planck mean opacity
determines the radiative cooling of an optically thin strongly magnetized
plasma. It is by factor of three smaller than non-magnetic Planck opacity at
$k_{\rm B}T < 0.1\,E_{\rm cyc}$ and increases by a factor of $10^2 - 10^4$ at
$k_{\rm B}T > 0.3\,E_{\rm cyc}$ due to cyclotron thermal processes. We propose
a simple approximate expression which has sufficient accuracy for the magnetic
Planck opacity description. We provide the Rosseland opacity in a tabular form
computed in the temperature range 1 - 300 keV, magnetic field range $3 \times
10^{10} - 10^{15}$ G, and a broad range of plasma densities. We demonstrate
that the scattering on the electron-positron pairs increases the Rosseland
opacity drastically at temperatures >50 keV in the case of mass densities
typical for accretion channel in X-ray pulsars.

also accounted for by the $J_c$ profile evolution along the thickness gradient.
Numerical simulations based on the Thermomagnetic Model are in fair agreement

radiative-convective terrestrial planet climate model that self-consistently
handles patchy clouds through a parameterized microphysical treatment of
condensation and sedimentation processes. Our model is general enough to
recreate Earth's atmospheric radiative environment without
over-parameterization, while also maintaining a simple implementation that is
applicable to a wide range of atmospheric compositions and physical planetary
properties. We first validate this new 1D patchy cloud radiative-convective
climate model by comparing it to Earth thermal structure data and to existing
climate and radiative transfer tools. We produce partially-clouded Earth-like
climates with cloud structures that are representative of deep tropospheric
convection and are adequate 1D representations of clouds within rocky planet
atmospheres. After validation against Earth, we then use our partially clouded
climate model and explore the potential climates of super-Earth exoplanets with
secondary nitrogen-dominated atmospheres which we assume are abiotic. We also
couple the partially clouded climate model to a full-physics, line-by-line
radiative transfer model and generate high-resolution spectra of simulated

changing of the entire end-effector. However, many situations require only the
modification or the change of the fingertip, making the exchange of the entire
gripper uneconomic. In this paper, we introduce a paradigm for automatic
task-specific fingertip production. The setup used in the proposed framework
consists of a production and task execution unit, containing a robotic
manipulator, and two 3D printers - autonomously producing the gripper fingers.
It also consists of a second manipulator that uses a quick-exchange mechanism
to pick up the printed fingertips and evaluates gripping performance. The setup
is experimentally validated by conducting automatic production of three
different fingertips and executing graspstability tests as well as multiple
pick- and insertion tasks, with and without position offsets - using these
fingertips. The proposed paradigm, indeed, goes beyond fingertip production and
serves as a foundation for a fully automatic fingertip design, production and

solve the initial value problem of fractional-order systems (FOS) is both
complex and essential in defining the dynamical behavior of the states of FOSs.
In this paper, we investigate the use of the initialization functions for the
purpose of estimating unknown parameters of linear non-commensurate FOSs. In
particular, we propose a novel ""pre-initial"" process that describes the dynamic
characteristic of FOSs before the initial state and consists of designing an
appropriate time-varying initialization function that ensures accurate
convergence of the estimates of the unknown parameters. To do so, we propose an
estimation technique that consists of two steps: (i) to design of practical
initialization function that is output-dependent and which is employed; (ii) to
solve the joint estimation problem of both parameters and fractional
differentiation orders (FDOs). A convergence proof has been presented. The
performance of the proposed method is illustrated through different numerical
examples. Potential applications of the algorithm to joint estimation of
parameters and FDOs of the fractional arterial Windkessel and neurovascular
models are also presented using both synthetic and real data. The added value
of the proposed ""pre-initial"" process to solve the studied estimation problem
is shown through different simulation tests that investigate the sensitivity of
estimation results using different time-varying initialization functions.

distribution shifts, given that only unlabeled test samples from the new domain
are accessible at test time. A common idea in most of the related works is
constructing pseudo-labels for the unlabeled test samples and applying gradient
descent (GD) to a loss function with the pseudo-labels. Recently, \cite{GSRK22}
propose conjugate labels, which is a new kind of pseudo-labels for
self-training at test time. They empirically show that the conjugate label
outperforms other ways of pseudo-labeling on many domain adaptation benchmarks.
However, provably showing that GD with conjugate labels learns a good
classifier for test-time adaptation remains open. In this work, we aim at
theoretically understanding GD with hard and conjugate labels for a binary
classification problem. We show that for square loss, GD with conjugate labels
converges to an $\epsilon$-optimal predictor under a Gaussian model for any
arbitrarily small $\epsilon$, while GD with hard pseudo-labels fails in this
task. We also analyze them under different loss functions for the update. Our
results shed lights on understanding when and why GD with hard labels or
conjugate labels works in test-time adaptation.

significant performance improvement, the wide use of fine-grained instructions

in this gap, we introduce a new setting, namely Underspecified
vision-and-Language Navigation (ULN), and associated evaluation datasets. ULN
evaluates agents using multi-level underspecified instructions instead of
purely fine-grained or coarse-grained, which is a more realistic and general

of a classification module, a navigation agent, and an
Exploitation-to-Exploration (E2E) module. Specifically, we propose to learn
Granularity Specific Sub-networks (GSS) for the agent to ground multi-level
instructions with minimal additional parameters. Then, our E2E module estimates
grounding uncertainty and conducts multi-step lookahead exploration to improve
the success rate further. Experimental results show that existing VLN models
are still brittle to multi-level language underspecification. Our framework is
more robust and outperforms the baselines on ULN by ~10% relative success rate

observations of the [CII] emission line at 158$\mu$m of HZ7, a main sequence
galaxy at $z=5.25$. Comparing to archival rest-frame UV observations taken by
the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we find strong evidence of the existence of
extended [CII] emission, which we estimate to be twice the size of the
rest-frame UV emission, yielding one of the first high-redshift objects where a
clear signature of a [CII] ``Halo'' has been detected to date. For a matched
S\'ersic profile with n = 1, we measured a [CII] effective radius of $0.50\pm
0.04$"" (3.07$\pm 0.25$ kpc) and an average rest-frame UV effective radius of
$0.2\pm0.04$"" ($1.48\pm0.16$ kpc). The [CII] morphology and kinematics of the
system suggest a merging event resulting in a non rotating disk system. This
event could be responsible for the extended [CII] emission. Alternatively, some
potential obscured emission could also explain the [CII] to UV size ratio.
These results contribute to the growing consensus with respect to the existence

when network data is sparse -- that is, when there are many more agents than
links per agent -- and when they are measured with error. We make three
contributions in this setting: (1) We show that OLS estimators can become
inconsistent under sparsity and characterize the threshold at which this
occurs, with and without measurement error. This threshold depends on the
centrality measure used. Specifically, regression on eigenvector is less robust
to sparsity than on degree and diffusion. (2) We develop distributional theory
for OLS estimators under measurement error and sparsity, finding that OLS
estimators are subject to asymptotic bias even when they are consistent.
Moreover, bias can be large relative to their variances, so that bias
correction is necessary for inference. (3) We propose novel bias correction and
inference methods for OLS with sparse noisy networks. Simulation evidence
suggests that our theory and methods perform well, particularly in settings
where the usual OLS estimators and heteroskedasticity-consistent/robust t-tests
are deficient. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our results in an

captured by the conventional RKKY approximation based on non-degenerate

""diverse misinformation"" the complex relationships between human biases and
demographics represented in misinformation. To investigate how users' biases
impact their susceptibility to misinformation and their ability to correct each
other, we analyze human classification of computer-generated videos (deepfakes)
as a type of diverse misinformation. We chose deepfakes as a case study for
three reasons: 1) their classification as misinformation is more objective; 2)
we can control the demographics of the personas presented; 3) deepfakes are a
real-world concern with associated harms that need to be better understood. Our
paper presents a survey (N=2,016) where U.S.-based participants are exposed to
videos and asked questions about their attributes, not knowing some might be
deepfakes. Our analysis measures the extent to which different users are duped
and which perceived demographics of deepfake personas tend to mislead.
Importantly, we find that accuracy varies significantly by demographics, and
participants are generally better at classifying videos that match them
(especially for white participants). We extrapolate from these results to
understand the population-level impacts of these biases using an idealized
mathematical model of the interplay between diverse misinformation and crowd
correction. Our model suggests that a diverse set of contacts might provide
""herd correction"" where friends can protect each other's blind spots.
Altogether, human biases and the attributes of misinformation matter greatly,
but having a diverse social group may help reduce susceptibility to
misinformation.

examples, we describe how the higher group structure of the gauge group in the
parent theory plays a crucial role in determining the gauge group and the
twisted sector of the orbifold theory. We also discuss the dependence of this
orbifold procedure on the duality frame.

enabled animatable avatars of clothed humans from sparse sets of multi-view RGB

neural radiance fields (NeRF), the inferred geometry often lacks detail due to
missing geometric constraints. Further, animating avatars in
out-of-distribution poses is not yet possible because the mapping from
observation space to canonical space does not generalize faithfully to unseen
poses. In this work, we address these shortcomings and propose a model to
create animatable clothed human avatars with detailed geometry that generalize
well to out-of-distribution poses. To achieve detailed geometry, we combine an
articulated implicit surface representation with volume rendering. For
generalization, we propose a novel joint root-finding algorithm for
simultaneous ray-surface intersection search and correspondence search. Our
algorithm enables efficient point sampling and accurate point canonicalization
while generalizing well to unseen poses. We demonstrate that our proposed
pipeline can generate clothed avatars with high-quality pose-dependent geometry
and appearance from a sparse set of multi-view RGB videos. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on geometry and appearance reconstruction while
creating animatable avatars that generalize well to out-of-distribution poses

driving mechanisms of the build-up of late-type galaxies (LTGs). The standard
scenario envisages two formation routes, with classical bulges (CBs) assembling
first in a quick quasi-monolithic episode followed by gradual disk assembly,
and pseudo-bulges (PBs) forming over the Gyr-long secular evolution of LTGs.
The expectation is, therefore, the segregation of present-day LTG bulges into
two distinct groups. Here we analyse the star formation histories (SFHs) of
bulges and disks for 135 LTGs from the CALIFA survey covering the relevant
range in LTG mass. In addition, their physical properties were contrasted with
predictions from evolutionary synthesis models, adopting exponentially
declining SFHs, with an e-folding time 0.1 < $\tau$ < 20 Gyr. Analysis of the
SFHs of ~ half-million spaxels consistently reveals that the main properties of
bulges and disks show a continuous distribution across total stellar mass.
Moreover, the $\tau$ in high-mass LTGs radially increases, suggesting that
these grow in an inside-out fashion, while lower-mass LTGs display roughly the
same $\tau$ throughout their entire radial extent. Evolutionary synthesis
predictions are consistent with observations. Finally, bulges and disks of
higher mass LTGs exhibit shorter formation timescales as compared to their
lower mass counterparts. Collectively, the obtained results evince a coherent
and unified picture for the formation and evolution of LTGs, in which PBs and
CBs denote extremities of a continuous sequence. This analysis is consistent
with the framework where bulges are assembled with their parent disks by
gradual inside-out growth, at a pace that is regulated by the depth of the
galactic potential. In accordance is the utter absence of bimodal correlations,
as expected if CBs and PBs were to emerge from two distinct formation routes.

Steady-state winds, comprising hot main-sequence winds and cool supergiant

calculate the total mass loss over the stellar lifetime for each model. Our
results reveal the existence of a critical metallicity $Z_{\rm{c}}$ at $Z \sim
10^{-3}$, where the mass loss exhibits a dramatic jump. If $Z>Z_{\rm{c}}$,
massive stars tend to evolve into cool supergiants, and a robust cool wind is
operational. In contrast, if $Z<Z_{\rm{c}}$, massive stars usually remain as
blue supergiants, wherein the cool wind is not activated and the mass loss is
generally weak. Moreover, we calculate the wind feedback in a $10^5$
$M_{\odot}$ star cluster with the Salpeter initial mass function. The kinetic
energy released by winds does not exhibit any significant transition at
$Z_{\rm{c}}$ because the wind velocity of a cool supergiant wind is low and
contributes little to the kinetic energy. The effects of critical metallicity
provide implications for the fates of metal-poor stars in the early universe.

with respect to the BH spin, resulting in a tilted accretion disk. Rotation of
the BH drags the surrounding space-time, manifesting as Lense-Thirring torques
that lead to disk precession and warping. We study these processes by
simulating a thin ($H/r=0.02$), highly tilted ($\mathcal{T}=65^\circ$)
accretion disk around a rapidly rotating ($a=0.9375$) BH at extremely high
resolutions, which we performed using the general-relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code H-AMR. The disk becomes significantly warped
and continuously tears into two individually precessing sub-disks. We find that
mass accretion rates far exceed the standard $\alpha$-viscosity expectations.
We identify two novel dissipation mechanisms specific to warped disks that are
the main drivers of accretion, distinct from the local turbulent stresses that
are usually thought to drive accretion. In particular, we identify extreme
scale height oscillations that occur twice an orbit throughout our disk. When
the scale height compresses, `nozzle' shocks form, dissipating orbital energy
and driving accretion. Separate from this phenomenon, there is also extreme
dissipation at the location of the tear. This leads to the formation of
low-angular momentum `streamers' that rain down onto the inner sub-disk,
shocking it. The addition of low angular momentum gas to the inner sub-disk
causes it to rapidly accrete, even when it is transiently aligned with the BH
spin and thus unwarped. These mechanisms, if general, significantly modify the
standard accretion paradigm. Additionally, they may drive structural changes on
much shorter timescales than expected in $\alpha$-disks, potentially explaining
some of the extreme variability observed in active galactic nuclei.

general proof that amplitudes at each order in the loop expansion are tame
functions of the external momenta and the couplings. We then consider a variety
of exact non-perturbative results and show that they are tame but only given
constraints on the UV definition of the theory. This provides further evidence
for the recent conjecture of the second author that all effective theories that
can be coupled to quantum gravity are tame. We also discuss whether
renormalization group flow is tame, and comment on the applicability of our
results to effective theories.

Hadron Collider (LHC). To improve the precision of measurements, as well as to
enable measurement of jet substructure at increasingly small angular scales,
tracking information is often used due to its superior angular resolution and
robustness to pile-up. Calculations of track-based observables involve
non-perturbative track functions, that absorb infrared divergences in
perturbative calculations and describe the transition to charged hadrons. The
infrared divergences are directly related to the renormalization group
evolution (RGE), and can be systematically computed in perturbation theory.
Unlike the standard DGLAP evolution, the RGE of the track functions is
non-linear, encoding correlations in the fragmentation process. We compute the
next-to-leading order (NLO) evolution of the track functions, which involves in
its kernel the full $1\rightarrow3$ splitting function. We discuss in detail
how how we implement the evolution equation numerically, and illustrate the
size of the NLO corrections. We also show that our equation can be viewed as a
master equation for collinear evolution at NLO, by illustrating that by
integrating out specific terms, one can derive the evolution for any $N$-hadron
fragmentation function. Our results provide a crucial ingredient for obtaining
track-based predictions for generic measurements at the LHC, and for improving
the description of the collinear dynamics of jets.

quantities in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) play a central role in the
interpretation of experimental data. Arguably the most important evolution
equations for collider physics applications are the
Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) equations, which describe
the evolution of a quark or gluon fragmenting into hadrons, with only a single
hadron identified at a time. In recent years, the study of the correlations of
energy flow within jets has come to play a central role at collider
experiments, necessitating an understanding of correlations, going beyond the
standard DGLAP paradigm. In this Letter we derive a general renormalization
group equation describing the collinear dynamics that account for correlations
in the fragmentation. We compute the kernel of this evolution equation at
next-to-leading order (NLO), where it involves the $1\to 3$ splitting
functions, and develop techniques to solve it numerically. We show that our
equation encompasses all previously-known collinear evolution equations, namely
DGLAP and the evolution of multi-hadron fragmentation functions. As an
application of our results, we consider the phenomenologically-relevant example
of energy flow on charged particles, computing the energy fraction in charged
particles in $e^+e^- \to$ hadrons at NNLO. Our results are an important step
towards improving the understanding of the collinear dynamics of jets, with
broad applications in jet substructure, ranging from the study of multi-hadron
correlations, to the description of inclusive (sub)jet production, and the
advancement of modern parton showers.

MTNG galaxies with those generated using a semi-analytic model to emulate the

$z\gtrsim12$, however, our simulation results underpredict the abundance of
luminous galaxies and their star-formation rates by almost an order of

scales, $r \sim 0.1 \ {\rm Mpc}/h$, i.e. the one-halo regime, while a companion
paper extends this to a two-halo model for larger distances. The occupation
statistics of ELGs in MTNG inform us that: (1) the satellite occupations
exhibit a slightly super-Poisson distribution, contrary to commonly made
assumptions, and (2) that haloes containing at least one ELG satellite are
twice as likely to host a central ELG. We propose simple recipes for modeling
these effects, each of which calls for the addition of a single free parameter
to simpler halo occupation models. To construct a reliable satellite population
model, we explore the LRG and ELG satellite radial and velocity distributions
and compare them with those of subhalos and particles in the simulation. We
find that ELGs are anisotropically distributed within halos, which together
with our occupation results provides strong evidence for cooperative galaxy
formation (manifesting itself as one-halo galaxy conformity); i.e.~galaxies
with similar properties form in close proximity to each other. Our refined
galaxy-halo model represents a useful improvement of commonly used analysis
tools and thus can be of help to increase the constraining power of large-scale

regime, $r\gtrsim 1{\rm Mpc}/h$. Interestingly, the ELG signal exhibits scale
dependence out to relatively large scales ($r\sim 20{\rm Mpc}/h$), implying
that the linear bias approximation for this tracer is invalid on these scales,
contrary to common assumptions. The 10-15\% discrepancy present in the standard
halo model prescription is only reconciled when we augment our halo occupation
model with a dependence on extrinsic halo properties (""shear"" being the
best-performing one) rather than intrinsic ones (e.g., concentration, peak
mass). We argue that this fact constitutes evidence for two-halo galaxy
conformity. Including tertiary assembly bias (i.e. a property beyond mass and
""shear"") is not an essential requirement for reconciling the galaxy assembly
bias signal of LRGs, but the combination of external and internal properties is
beneficial for recovering ELG the clustering. We find that centrals in low-mass
haloes dominate the assembly bias signal of both populations. Finally, we
explore the predictions of our model for higher-order statistics such as

s$^{-1}$, are a fascinating high-redshift population that is absent in the
local universe. They are the best candidates for supermassive black holes
accreting at rates at or above the Eddington limit, and they are associated
with the most rapid and powerful outflows of ionized gas known to date. They
are also hosted by massive galaxies. Here we present the first integral field
unit (IFU) observations of a high-redshift quasar obtained by the Near Infrared
Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which
targeted SDSSJ165202.64+172852.3, an extremely red quasar at $z=2.94$. JWST
observations reveal extended ionized gas - as traced by [OIII]$\lambda$5007\AA
- in the host galaxy of the quasar, its outflow, and the circumgalactic medium.
The complex morphology and kinematics imply that the quasar resides in a very
dense environment with several interacting companion galaxies within projected
distances of 10-15 kpc. The high density of the environment and the large
velocities of the companion galaxies suggest that this system may represent the
core of a forming cluster of galaxies. The system is a good candidate for a
merger of two or more dark matter halos, each with a mass of a few $10^{13}$
M$_\odot$ and traces potentially one of the densest knots at $z\sim3$.

galaxy assembly bias using non-linear redshift-space clustering of galaxies. We
scale cosmological N-body simulations and insert galaxies with the SubHalo
Abundance Matching extended (SHAMe) empirical model to generate over 175,000
clustering measurements spanning all relevant cosmological and SHAMe parameter
values. We then build an emulator capable of reproducing the projected galaxy
correlation function at the monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole level for
separations between $0.1\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ and $25\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. We test
this approach by using the emulator and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)
inference to jointly estimate cosmology and assembly bias parameters both for
the MTNG740 hydrodynamic simulation and for a semi-analytical galaxy formation
model (SAM) built on the MTNG740-DM dark matter-only simulation, obtaining
unbiased results for all cosmological parameters. For instance, for MTNG740 and
a galaxy number density of $n\sim 0.01 h^{3}{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$, we obtain
$\sigma_{8}=0.799^{+0.039}_{-0.044}$ ($\sigma_{8,{\rm MTNG}} =$ 0.8159), and
$\Omega_\mathrm{M}h^2= 0.138^{+ 0.025}_{- 0.018}$ ($\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}
h^2_{\rm MTNG} =$ 0.142). For fixed Hubble parameter ($h$), the constraint
becomes $\Omega_\mathrm{M}h^2= 0.137^{+ 0.011}_{- 0.012}$. Our method performs
similarly well for the SAM and for other tested sample densities. We almost
always recover the true amount of galaxy assembly bias within one sigma. The
best constraints are obtained when scales smaller than $2\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ are
included, as well as when at least the projected correlation function and the
monopole are incorporated. These methods offer a powerful way to constrain
cosmological parameters using galaxy surveys.

Automata (FA) as their computation model. Among different FA variants,
deterministic (DFA) and non-deterministic (NFA) are the most commonly used
computation models for FA-based pattern matching engines. Moreover, NFA is the
prevalent model in pattern matching engines on spatial architectures. The
reasons are: i) DFA size, as in #states, can be exponential compared to
equivalent NFA, ii) DFA cannot exploit the massive parallelism available on
spatial architectures. This paper performs an empirical study on the #state of
minimized DFA and optimized NFA across a diverse set of real-world benchmarks
and shows that if distinct DFAs are generated for distinct patterns, #states of
minimized DFA are typically equal to their equivalent optimized NFA. However,
NFA is more robust in maintaining the low #states for some benchmarks. Thus,
the choice of NFA vs. DFA for spatial architecture is less important than the
need to generate distinct DFAs for each pattern and support these distinct
DFAs' parallel processing. Finally, this paper presents a throughput study for
von Neumann's architecture-based (CPU) vs. spatial architecture-based (FPGA)
automata processing engines. The study shows that, based on the workload,
neither CPU-based automata processing engine nor FPGA-based automata processing
engine is the clear winner. If #patterns matched per workload increases, the
CPU-based automata processing engine's throughput decreases. On the other hand,
the FPGA-based automata processing engine lacks the memory spilling option;
hence, it fails to accommodate an entire automata if it does not fit into
FPGA's logic fabric. In the best-case scenario, the CPU has a 4.5x speedup over
the FPGA, while for some benchmarks, the FPGA has a 32,530x speedup over the

quantum fluctuations are crucial in the cohesion of microscale and nanoscale
particles. In reality, these particles have a variety of irregular shapes that
differ considerably from any idealized geometry. Previous experiments have
demonstrated that dispersion forces strongly depend on the geometry. Because of
the nonadditivity of these forces, commonly used numerical additive methods,
such as the Hamaker and Derjaguin approximations, are not suitable for
calculations with complex geometries. Moreover, experimental studies are
difficult to identify the contributions of the dispersion force from the many
forces that constitute the cohesion. Therefore, no general law about the
influence of particle geometry on dispersion forces has been established. Thus,
in this paper, the fluctuating surface current (FSC) technique, an exact
scattering theory-based nonadditive algorithm, was used to study this
influence. To characterize complex geometries, a data-adaptive spatial
filtering method was introduced to perform scale decomposition, and descriptors
at three observation levels (global, local, and surface) were used. Based on
the advanced geometric analyses and accurate numerical calculations, the
influence of multiscale surface fluctuations on dispersion forces was
determined. Furthermore, a convenient formula for predicting the dispersion
forces between particles with complex shapes from the exact Lifshitz solution
was established via multistage corrections.

that the resolvers of non-determinism for history-deterministic OCNs are

reductive group. First, we exhibit an example of a klt singularity admitting a
$\mathbb{P}{\rm GL}_n(\mathbb{K})$-cover that is not of klt type. Then, we
restrict ourselves to $G$-quasi-torsors, a special class of $G$-covers that
behave like $G$-torsors outside closed subsets of codimension two. Given a
$G$-quasi-torsor $X\rightarrow Y$, where $G$ is a finite extension of a torus
$\mathbb{T}$, we show that $X$ is of klt type if and only if $Y$ is of klt
type. We prove a structural theorem for $\mathbb{T}$-quasi-torsors over normal
varieties in terms of Cox rings. As an application, we show that every sequence
of $\mathbb{T}$-quasi-torsors over a variety with klt type singularities is
eventually a sequence of $\mathbb{T}$-torsors. This is the torus version of a
result due to Greb-Kebekus-Peternell regarding finite quasi-torsors of
varieties with klt type singularities. On the contrary, we show that in any
dimension there exists a sequence of finite quasi-torsors and
$\mathbb{T}$-quasi-torsors over a klt type variety, such that infinitely many
of them are not torsors. We show that every variety with klt type singularities
is a quotient of a variety with canonical factorial singularities. We prove
that a variety with Zariski locally toric singularities is indeed the quotient
of a smooth variety by a solvable group. Finally, motivated by the work of
Stibitz, we study the optimal class of singularities for which the previous
results hold.

appropriately interpreted, it yields a chain complex that is naturally
quasi-isomorphic to the singular chains on the free loop space of the geometric

coincident with the radio emission. These filaments are positioned in
projection at the edge of the Orion-Eridanus superbubble and we find evidence
indicating that the filaments align with the coherent magnetic field of the
outer Galaxy. We find a lower limit on the total radio flux at 1.4~GHz to be
$0.7\pm0.3$~Jy with an average linearly polarized fraction of $40\substack{+30

these filaments, including a shell-type supernova remnant (SNR), a bow shock
nebula associated with a pulsar, or relic fragments from one or more supernova
explosions in the adjacent superbubble, with a hybrid scenario being most
likely. This may represent an example of a new class of objects that is neither
an SNR nor a bow shock. The highly compressed nature of these filaments and
their alignment with Galactic plane suggests a scenario where this object
formed in a magnetic field that was compressed by the expanding Orion-Eridanus
superbubble, suggesting that the object is related to this superbubble and
implying a distance of $\sim$400~pc.

architecture-dependent first-order optimisation algorithms. The approach works
by combining a ""functional majorisation"" of the loss function with
""architectural perturbation bounds"" that encode an explicit dependence on
neural architecture. The framework yields optimisation methods that transfer
hyperparameters across learning problems. On generalisation, a new
correspondence is proposed between ensembles of networks and individual
networks. It is argued that, as network width and normalised margin are taken
large, the space of networks that interpolate a particular training set
concentrates on an aggregated Bayesian method known as a ""Bayes point machine"".
This correspondence provides a route for transferring PAC-Bayesian
generalisation theorems over to individual networks. More broadly, the
correspondence presents a fresh perspective on the role of regularisation in
networks with vastly more parameters than data.

Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric with a set of parameters.
Then, we study the rescaling properties of the curvature parameter, and find
that zero spatial curvature of the FLRW metric is singled out as the unique

claim here, contrary to many views discussed there, that there is no

misconceptions leading to the representation of spacetime as a timeless Block
Universe. The physical expanding universe is in fact an Evolving Block Universe
with a time-dependent future boundary. This establishes a global direction of
time that determines local arrows of time. Furthermore time passes when quantum
wave function collapse takes place; during this process, information is lost.
The mind/brain acts as an imperfect clock, which coarse-grains the physical
passage of time along a world line to determine the experienced passage of
time, because neuronal processes take time to occur. This happens in a
contextual way, so experienced time is not linearly related to physical time in
general.

  Theory",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent and past works, convexity is usually assumed on each individual
part of the action functional in order to demonstrate the existence and
uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium on some interval [0, T] (this meant that each
hessian was assumed to be nonnegative). Particularly, a certain assumption was
imposed in order to quantify the smallness of T. The contribution of this
project is to expand on this with the key insight being that one does not need
the convexity of each part of the action, but rather just an appropriate
combination of them, which will essentially ""compensate"" for the other two
terms to yield convexity in the action.
  This is meaningful in both the pure and applied settings as it generalizes
the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium slightly more, but maybe
more importantly matches real world application slightly closer, as in reality
there are many settings in which not each part of the action have convexity.
Thus, it is more accurate for modern application of Mean Field Game Theory.

($34\leq Z\leq 90$) present in HD 222925. We find that the abundance pattern of
lighter r-process elements newly identified in HD 222925 presents a challenge
for our existing nucleosynthesis models to reproduce. The most likely
astrophysical explanation for the elemental pattern of HD 222925 is that its
light r-process elements were created in rapidly expanding ejecta (e.g., from
shocked, dynamical ejecta of compact object merger binaries). However, we find
that the light r-process-element pattern can also be successfully reproduced by
employing different nuclear mass models, indicating a need for a fresh
investigation of nuclear input data for elements with $46\lesssim Z\lesssim 52$
by experimental methods. Either way, the new elemental abundance pattern of HD
222925 -- particularly the abundances obtained from space-based, ultraviolet
(UV) data -- call for a deeper understanding of both astrophysical r-process

architecture that reflects fluvial deposition. The heterogeneity in
petrophysical properties arising from this architecture influences the dynamics
of injected CO2. We previously used a geocellular modeling approach to
represent this heterogeneity, including heterogeneity in constitutive
saturation relationships. The dynamics of CO2 plumes in fluvial reservoirs was
investigated during and after injection. It was shown that small-scale
(centimeter to meter) features play a critical role in capillary trapping
processes and have a primary effect on physical- and dissolution-trapping of
CO2, and on the ultimate distribution of CO2 in the reservoir. Heterogeneity in
saturation functions at that small scale enhances capillary trapping (snap
off), creates capillary pinning, and increases the surface area of the plume.
The understanding of these small-scale trapping processes from previous work is
here used to develop effective saturation relationships that represent, at a
larger scale, the integral effect of these processes. While it is generally not
computationally feasible to represent the small-scale heterogeneity directly in
a typical reservoir simulation, the effective saturation relationships for
capillary pressure and relative permeability presented here, along with an
effective intrinsic permeability, allow better representation of the total
physical trapping at the scale of larger model grid cells, as typically used in
reservoir simulations, and thus the approach diminishes limits on cell size and
decreases simulation time in reservoir simulations.

a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that typically learns
reciprocity-based cooperation in partially competitive environments. However,
LOLA often fails to learn such behaviour on more complex policy spaces
parameterized by neural networks, partly because the update rule is sensitive
to the policy parameterization. This problem is especially pronounced in the
opponent modeling setting, where the opponent's policy is unknown and must be
inferred from observations; in such settings, LOLA is ill-specified because
behaviorally equivalent opponent policies can result in non-equivalent updates.
To address this shortcoming, we reinterpret LOLA as approximating a proximal
operator, and then derive a new algorithm, proximal LOLA (POLA), which uses the
proximal formulation directly. Unlike LOLA, the POLA updates are
parameterization invariant, in the sense that when the proximal objective has a
unique optimum, behaviorally equivalent policies result in behaviorally
equivalent updates. We then present practical approximations to the ideal POLA
update, which we evaluate in several partially competitive environments with
function approximation and opponent modeling. This empirically demonstrates
that POLA achieves reciprocity-based cooperation more reliably than LOLA.

on various inputs including audio, visual, and textual cues. This paper focuses
on emotion recognition using visual features. To leverage the correlation
between facial expression and the emotional state of a person, pioneering
methods rely primarily on facial features. However, facial features are often
unreliable in natural unconstrained scenarios, such as in crowded scenes, as
the face lacks pixel resolution and contains artifacts due to occlusion and
blur. To address this, in the wild emotion recognition exploits full-body
person crops as well as the surrounding scene context. In a bid to use body
pose for emotion recognition, such methods fail to realize the potential that
facial expressions, when available, offer. Thus, the aim of this paper is
two-fold. First, we demonstrate our method, PERI, to leverage both body pose
and facial landmarks. We create part aware spatial (PAS) images by extracting
key regions from the input image using a mask generated from both body pose and
facial landmarks. This allows us to exploit body pose in addition to facial
context whenever available. Second, to reason from the PAS images, we introduce
context infusion (Cont-In) blocks. These blocks attend to part-specific
information, and pass them onto the intermediate features of an emotion
recognition network. Our approach is conceptually simple and can be applied to
any existing emotion recognition method. We provide our results on the publicly
available in the wild EMOTIC dataset. Compared to existing methods, PERI
achieves superior performance and leads to significant improvements in the mAP
of emotion categories, while decreasing Valence, Arousal and Dominance errors.
Importantly, we observe that our method improves performance in both images
with fully visible faces as well as in images with occluded or blurred faces.

that we have monochromatic (nested, separated, crossing) subtrees of size only

spanning tree in 2-colorings of ordered complete graphs verifies a more general
conjecture for twisted drawings. Our second subject is to refine the Ramsey
number of matchings for ordered complete graphs. Cockayne and Lorimer proved
that for given positive integers t, n, m=(t-1)(n-1)+2n is the smallest integer

Km contains a monochromatic matching with n edges. We conjecture a
strengthening: t-colored ordered complete graphs on m vertices contain

order to solve the above four problems, this study explores a new method of
discipline reputation evaluation. Taking the business administration discipline
as an example, it collects data of 5848 doctoral graduates who first entered
teaching posts, establishes a directed adjacency matrix from the employment
unit to the doctoral degree awarding unit, and uses the theory and method of
social network analysis to conduct quantitative analysis on the doctoral mutual
employment network. The results show that: (1) PhD exchange network can explain
discipline reputation and is a new indicator to measure discipline reputation;
(2) From the perspective of employment behavior among colleges and
universities, there is horizontal flow and downward flow between the head
colleges and universities, and downward flow is mainly among the middle and
lower colleges. There is a time lag between college talent recruitment and
academic achievement output. Therefore, the mining of the structural
characteristics and network evolution trend of the PhD exchange network based
on the ""foot voting"" of doctoral graduates is faster than the discipline
ranking based on the follow-up achievement indicators to reflect the changes in
the discipline quality, which can be used to warn the changes in the discipline
quality.

issue in many problems involving friction between sliding interfaces, from
tribology to the study of earthquakes and seismic faults. On the one hand, a
macroscopic sliding event is preceded by slip precursors with a characteristic
propagation length scale. On the other hand, the emergent frictional properties
can be modified by surface patterning depending on their geometric length
scale. This suggests that macroscopic sliding of structured surfaces is
governed by the interplay between the length scale of the slip precursors and
those characterizing the geometric features. In this paper, we investigate
these aspects by means of numerical simulations using a two-dimensional
spring-block model. We discuss the influence of the geometric features on the
occurrence and localization of slip precursors, extending the study to
interfaces characterized by two geometric length scales. We find that different
types of detachment sequences are triggered by specific surface structures,
depending on their scales and relation to sliding direction, leading to a
macroscopically smooth transition to sliding in the case of hierarchical and/or
anisotropic features. These concepts could be exploited in devices switching
from static to dynamic sliding, and can contribute to an improvement in the
understanding and interpretation of seismic data

spanwise coherent rollers characteristic of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) type of

the K-H-type regime, which has implications for transport processes. At the

the surface geometry and undergoes amplitude modulation. This flow component

Features related to population activity, mobility, and facility density are

training and testing graph attention network (GAT) models to capture non-linear
feature interactions as well as spatial interdependence among neighborhoods. We
tested the models in five U.S. cities across the four disease types. The
results show that the GAT model can predict the health status of people in

that population activity and built-environment features along with
socio-demographic features differentiate the health status of neighborhoods to
such a great extent that a GAT model could predict the health status using
these features with high accuracy. The results also show that the model trained
on one city can predict health status in another city with high accuracy,

trustworthiness of the AI black-boxes in real deployment can be achieved by
explainable AI (XAI) tools to build transparency between the interacting actors
in the slicing ecosystem, such as tenants, infrastructure providers and
operators. Inspired by the turbo principle, this paper presents a novel
iterative explainable federated learning (FL) approach where a constrained
resource allocation model and an \emph{explainer} exchange -- in a closed loop
(CL) fashion -- soft attributions of the features as well as inference
predictions to achieve a transparent and SLA-aware zero-touch service

validate the faithfulness of the explanations via the so-called

the run-time FL optimization task. In this respect, Integrated-Gradient (IG) as
well as Input $\times$ Gradient and SHAP are used to generate the attributions
for the turbo explainable FL (TEFL), wherefore simulation results under
different methods confirm its superiority over an unconstrained

the transport is slow over the domain, while gradients in the reaction
heterogeneity are not too sharp, we study the stability of a heterogeneous
steady state approximated by the system in the absence of transport. Using a
WKB ansatz, we find that this steady state can undergo a Turing-type
instability in subsets of the domain, leading to the formation of localized
patterns. The boundaries of the pattern-forming regions are given
asymptotically by `local' Turing conditions corresponding to a spatially
homogeneous analysis parameterized by the spatial variable. We developed a
general open-source code which is freely available, and show numerical examples
of this localized pattern formation in a Schnakenberg cross-diffusion system, a

furthermore imply an $\mathrm{Mpc}$-scale IGM density $1 + \delta_\mathrm{IGM}
= 40\substack{+30\\-10}$. The buoyantly rising lobes are crushed by the IGM at
their inner side, where an approximate balance between IGM and lobe pressure
occurs: $P_\mathrm{IGM} \approx P$. The ideal gas law then suggests an IGM
temperature $T_\mathrm{IGM} = 11\substack{+12\\-5} \cdot 10^6\ \mathrm{K}$, or
$k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{IGM} = 0.9\substack{+1.0\\-0.4}\ \mathrm{keV}$, at the
virial radius -- consistent with X-ray-derived temperatures of similarly
massive groups. Interestingly, the method is not performing at its limit: in
principle, estimates $T_\mathrm{IGM} \sim 4 \cdot 10^6\ \mathrm{K}$ are already
possible -- rivalling the lowest X-ray measurements available. The technique's
future scope extends from galaxy group outskirts to the WHIM. In conclusion, we
demonstrate that observations of GRGs in Cosmic Web filaments are finally
sensitive enough to probe the thermodynamics of galaxy groups and beyond.

surface. We find that burst-like deposition of material into the inner disc
seen in 3D simulations by itself does not always signify powerful accretion
bursts. Only high density post-collapse clumps crossing the inner computational
boundary may result in observable bursts. The rich physics of the inner disc
has a significant impact on the expected accretion bursts: (1) In the standard
turbulent viscosity discs, migrating objects can stall at a migration trap at
the distance of a few au from the star. However, in discs powered by magnetised
winds, the objects are able to cross the trap and produce bursts akin to those
observed so far. (2) Migrating objects may interact with and modify the thermal
(hydrogen ionisation) instability of the inner disc, which can be responsible
for longer duration and lower luminosity bursts in HMYSOs. (3) If the central
star is bloated to a fraction of an au by a previous episode of high accretion
rate, or if the migrating object is particularly dense, a merger rather than a
disc-mediated accretion burst results; (4) Object disruption bursts may be
super-Eddington, leading to episodic feedback on HMYSO surroundings via
powerful outflows.

causality is a powerful approach for detecting predictive interactions between

utility in domains where the dynamics need to be represented as directed
acyclic graphs (DAGs) rather than as a linear sequence, such as with cell
differentiation trajectories. Here, we present GrID-Net, a framework based on
graph neural networks with lagged message passing for Granger causal inference
on DAG-structured systems. Our motivating application is the analysis of
single-cell multimodal data to identify genomic loci that mediate the
regulation of specific genes. To our knowledge, GrID-Net is the first
single-cell analysis tool that accounts for the temporal lag between a genomic
locus becoming accessible and its downstream effect on a target gene's
expression. We applied GrID-Net on multimodal single-cell assays that profile
chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and gene expression (RNA-seq) in the same
cell and show that it dramatically outperforms existing methods for inferring
regulatory locus-gene links, achieving up to 71% greater agreement with
independent population genetics-based estimates. By extending Granger causality
to DAG-structured dynamical systems, our work unlocks new domains for causal
analyses and, more specifically, opens a path towards elucidating gene
regulatory interactions relevant to cellular differentiation and complex human
diseases at unprecedented scale and resolution.

propensity-based trimming, the practice of removing units with extreme
propensities from the sample. This practice has theoretical grounding when the
data are homoscedastic and the propensity model is parametric (Yang and Ding,
2018; Crump et al. 2009), but in modern settings where heteroscedastic data are
analyzed with non-parametric models, existing theory fails to support current
practice. In this work, we address this challenge by developing new methods and
theory for sample trimming. Our contributions are three-fold: first, we
describe novel procedures for selecting which units to trim. Our procedures
differ from previous work in that we trim not only units with small
propensities, but also units with extreme conditional variances. Second, we
give new theoretical guarantees for inference after trimming. In particular, we
show how to perform inference on the trimmed subpopulation without requiring
that our regressions converge at parametric rates. Instead, we make only
fourth-root rate assumptions like those in the double machine learning
literature. This result applies to conventional propensity-based trimming as
well and thus may be of independent interest. Finally, we propose a
bootstrap-based method for constructing simultaneously valid confidence
intervals for multiple trimmed sub-populations, which are valuable for
navigating the trade-off between sample size and variance reduction inherent in
trimming. We validate our methods in simulation, on the 2007-2008 National

hard, because, although obtaining independent samples efficiently from the
unconditioned dynamics is usually feasible, generally most of the samples must
be discarded (in a form of importance sampling) because they do not satisfy the
imposed conditions. Sampling directly from the conditioned distribution is
non-trivial, as conditioning breaks the causal properties of the dynamics which
ultimately renders the sampling procedure efficient. One standard way of
achieving it is through a Metropolis Monte-Carlo procedure, but this procedure
is normally slow and a very large number of Monte-Carlo steps is needed to
obtain a small number of statistically independent samples. In this work, we
propose an alternative method to produce independent samples from a conditioned
distribution. The method learns the parameters of a generalized dynamical model
that optimally describe the conditioned distribution in a variational sense.
The outcome is an effective, unconditioned, dynamical model, from which one can
trivially obtain independent samples, effectively restoring causality of the
conditioned distribution. The consequences are twofold: on the one hand, it
allows us to efficiently compute observables from the conditioned dynamics by
simply averaging over independent samples. On the other hand, the method gives
an effective unconditioned distribution which is easier to interpret. The
method is flexible and can be applied virtually to any dynamics. We discuss an
important application of the method, namely the problem of epidemic risk
assessment from (imperfect) clinical tests, for a large family of
time-continuous epidemic models endowed with a Gillespie-like sampler. We show
that the method compares favorably against the state of the art, including the
soft-margin approach and mean-field methods.

range of helium core masses $\approx 2.5 -3 M_{\odot}$ whose envelopes expand

either mass transfer remains stable and mass loss is driven from the system in

causes a common envelope event (CEE) through which the helium envelope is
unbound. The ensuing CSM properties are consistent with the CSM masses ($\sim

fermionic-based partitioning Trotter errors lower compared to those in

Pop III IMF which is dependent on the efficiency of primordial gas

hydrodynamic simulations, but with a computational efficiency which allows us
to investigate the observable differences between a wide range of potential Pop

provide insight into the evolution of the H2 dissociating background. While the
slope of the Pop III IMF does not significantly affect the predicted number
density of the first stars, more top heavy IMFs produce Pop III star clusters

of modern communication systems. Currently, two fundamental bottlenecks,
namely, power consumption and receiver saturation, limit the full potential
achievement of this technology. These bottlenecks are intricately linked with
the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) used in each radio frequency (RF) chain.
The power consumption in MIMO systems grows exponentially with the ADC's bit
budget while ADC saturation causes permanent loss of information. This
motivates the need for a solution that can simultaneously tackle the
above-mentioned bottlenecks while offering advantages over existing
alternatives such as low-resolution ADCs. Taking a radically different approach
to this problem, we propose $\lambda$-MIMO architecture which uses modulo ADCs

Unlimited Sampling Framework. $M_\lambda$-ADC in the RF chain folds high
dynamic range signals into low dynamic range modulo samples, thus alleviating
the ADC saturation problem. At the same time, digitization of modulo signal
results in high resolution quantization. In the novel $\lambda$-MIMO context,
we discuss baseband signal reconstruction, detection and uplink achievable
sum-rate performance. The key takeaways of our work include, (a) leveraging
higher signal-to-quantization noise ratio (SQNR), (b) detection and average
uplink sum-rate performances comparable to a conventional, infinite-resolution
ADC when using a $1$-$2$ bit $M_\lambda$-ADC. This enables higher order
modulation schemes e.g. $1024$ QAM that seemed previously impossible, (c)
superior trade-off between energy efficiency and bit budget, thus resulting in
higher power efficiency. Numerical simulations and modulo ADC based hardware
experiments corroborate our theory and reinforce the clear benefits of

bifurcation points and is characterised by an aperiodic switching between a
large-amplitude ""on"" state and a small-amplitude ""off"" state. L\'evy on-off
intermittency is a recently introduced generalisation of on-off intermittency
to multiplicative L\'evy noise, which depends on a stability parameter $\alpha$
and a skewness parameter $\beta$. Here, we derive two novel results on L\'evy
on-off intermittency by leveraging known exact results on the first-passage
time statistics of L\'evy flights. First, we compute anomalous critical
exponents explicitly as a function of arbitrary L\'evy noise parameters
$(\alpha,\beta)$ for the first time, by a heuristic method, complementing
previous results. The predictions are verified using numerical solutions of the
fractional Fokker-Planck equation. Second, we derive the power spectrum $S(f)$
of L\'evy on-off intermittency and show that it displays a power law
$S(f)\propto f^\kappa$ at low frequencies $f$, where $\kappa\in (-1,0)$ depends
on the noise parameters $\alpha,\beta$. An explicit expression for $\kappa$ is
obtained in terms of $(\alpha,\beta)$. The predictions are verified using long
time series realisations of L\'evy on-off intermittency. Our findings help shed
light on instabilities subject to non-equilibrium, power-law-distributed
fluctuations, emphasizing that their properties can differ starkly from the
case of Gaussian fluctuations.

with respect to the black hole spin axis. If the scale height of the disk is
much smaller than the misalignment angle, the spin of the black hole can tear
the disk into multiple, independently precessing `sub-disks'. This is most
likely to happen during outbursts in black hole X-Ray binaries (BHXRBs) and in
active galactic nuclei (AGN) accreting above a few percent of the Eddington
limit, because the disk becomes razor-thin. Disk tearing has the potential to
explain variability phenomena including quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in
BHXRBs and changing-look phenomena in AGN. Here, we present the first radiative
two-temperature GRMHD simulation of a strongly tilted ($65^{\circ}$) accretion
disk around a $M_{BH}=10M_{\odot}$ black hole, which tears and precesses. This
leads to luminosity swings between a few percent and $50 \%$ of the Eddington
limit on sub-viscous timescales. Surprisingly, even where the disk is radiation
pressure dominated, the accretion disk is thermally stable over $t \gtrsim
14,000 r_g/c$. This suggests warps play an important role in stabilizing the
disk against thermal collapse. The disk forms two nozzle shocks perpendicular
to the line of nodes where the scale height of the disk decreases $10$-fold and
the electron temperature reaches $T_e \sim 10^8-10^9 K$. In addition, optically
thin gas crossing the tear between the inner and outer disk gets heated to $T_e
\sim 10^8 K$. This suggests that warped disks may emit a Comptonized spectrum

potentially continuous) design parameters is a ubiquitous problem in scientific
and engineering applications. Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular,
sample-efficient method that leverages a probabilistic surrogate model and an
acquisition function (AF) to select promising designs to evaluate. However,
maximizing the AF over mixed or high-cardinality discrete search spaces is
challenging standard gradient-based methods cannot be used directly or
evaluating the AF at every point in the search space would be computationally
prohibitive. To address this issue, we propose using probabilistic
reparameterization (PR). Instead of directly optimizing the AF over the search
space containing discrete parameters, we instead maximize the expectation of
the AF over a probability distribution defined by continuous parameters. We
prove that under suitable reparameterizations, the BO policy that maximizes the
probabilistic objective is the same as that which maximizes the AF, and
therefore, PR enjoys the same regret bounds as the original BO policy using the
underlying AF. Moreover, our approach provably converges to a stationary point
of the probabilistic objective under gradient ascent using scalable, unbiased
estimators of both the probabilistic objective and its gradient. Therefore, as
the number of starting points and gradient steps increase, our approach will
recover of a maximizer of the AF (an often-neglected requisite for commonly
used BO regret bounds). We validate our approach empirically and demonstrate
state-of-the-art optimization performance on a wide range of real-world
applications. PR is complementary to (and benefits) recent work and naturally
generalizes to settings with multiple objectives and black-box constraints.

indicative of the fluctuating nature of the CO; and the proliferation of CO

conformally couples to a scalar field through the Lagrangian density of matter,
whether matter is characterized by classical or by quantum (statistical)

achieve the order of $1/\Lambda_E^2$ with the cosmological constant
$\Lambda_E\approx 2.4\,\rm{meV}$. This is about 60 orders of magnitude larger
than Newtonian gravity, i.e., ${(M_{\mathrm{Pl}}/\Lambda_E)}^2\sim 10^{60}$,
where $M_{\mathrm{Pl}}\approx2.4\times 10^{18}\, \rm{GeV} $ is the reduced
Planck energy. However, the discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of the conformal
coupling does not allow a massless scalar field, satisfying the constraint that
no evidence of the long range force is observed. The interaction range of the
force is inversely proportional to the square root of the ambient density.
Therefore, in the general situation in which the ambient density is larger than
the current cosmic density, the interaction range is always smaller than
$1/\Lambda_E \approx 80\, \mu\rm{m}$. The form of general relativity (GR) still
holds even when the energy-momentum tensors of the quintessence and the
conformal interaction are included. The main purpose here is to overcome the

solution concept par excellence for pseudo-games is the generalized Nash

another strategy in the strategy set determined by the other players'

interest, due to applications in a wide variety of fields, from environmental

PPAD-hard in general, it is still of interest to try to compute them in
restricted classes of pseudo-games. One approach is to search for a strategy
profile that minimizes exploitability, i.e., the sum of the regrets across all
players. As exploitability is nondifferentiable in general, developing
efficient first-order methods that minimize it might not seem possible at first
glance. We observe, however, that the exploitability-minimization problem can
be recast as a min-max optimization problem, and thereby obtain polynomial-time
first-order methods to compute a refinement of GNE, namely the variational
equilibria (VE), in convex-concave cumulative regret pseudo-games with jointly
convex constraints. More generally, we also show that our methods find the
stationary points of the exploitability in polynomial time in Lipschitz-smooth
pseudo-games with jointly convex constraints. Finally, we demonstrate in
experiments that our methods not only outperform known algorithms, but that
even in pseudo-games where they are not guaranteed to converge to a GNE, they
may do so nonetheless, with proper initialization.

Recently, Wortsman et al. (2020) proposed a CL method, SupSup, which uses a
randomly initialized, fixed base network (model) and finds a supermask for each
new task that selectively keeps or removes each weight to produce a subnetwork.
They prevent forgetting as the network weights are not being updated. Although
there is no forgetting, the performance of the supermask is sub-optimal because
fixed weights restrict its representational power. Furthermore, there is no
accumulation or transfer of knowledge inside the model when new tasks are
learned. Hence, we propose ExSSNeT (Exclusive Supermask SubNEtwork Training),
which performs exclusive and non-overlapping subnetwork weight training. This
avoids conflicting updates to the shared weights by subsequent tasks to improve
performance while still preventing forgetting. Furthermore, we propose a novel
KNN-based Knowledge Transfer (KKT) module that dynamically initializes a new
task's mask based on previous tasks for improving knowledge transfer. We
demonstrate that ExSSNeT outperforms SupSup and other strong previous methods
on both text classification and vision tasks while preventing forgetting.
Moreover, ExSSNeT is particularly advantageous for sparse masks that activate
2-10% of the model parameters, resulting in an average improvement of 8.3% over

show that there exist commonly-studied systems for which leading RC frameworks
struggle to learn the dynamics unless key information about the underlying

trajectory containing almost the entire transient in order to identify the
correct attractor even after being trained with optimal hyperparameters.
Accordingly, we turn to Next-Generation Reservoir Computing (NGRC), an
attractive variant of RC that requires negligible warm-up time. By
incorporating the exact nonlinearities in the original equations, we show that
NGRC can accurately reconstruct intricate and high-dimensional basins of

trajectory). Yet, a tiny uncertainty on the exact nonlinearity can already
break NGRC, rendering the prediction accuracy no better than chance. Our

gradients ubiquitous in plasmas can modify wave propagation and absorption. We
derive a quasilocal inhomogeneous correction to the plasma dielectric for
arbitrary distributions by expanding the phase correlation integral and develop
a novel integration technique that allows our correction to be applied in many
situations and has greater accuracy than other inhomogeneous dielectric
formulas found in the literature. We apply this dielectric tensor to the
lower-hybrid current drive problem and demonstrate that inhomogeneous wave
damping does not affect the lower-hybrid wave's linear damping condition, and
in the non-Maxwellian problem damping and propagation should remain unchanged
except in the case of waves with very large phase velocities.

  submodules of $\mathbb{F}_q[[T]]^d$","25 pages",,,,"math.CO math.AG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Fix an integer $d\geq 1$. Solomon counts index-$n$ submodules of the free
module $R^d$ for any Dedekind domain $R$ that admits a Dedekind zeta function.
The proof involves the Hermite normal form for matrices. We propose another
normal form in the case where $R=\mathbb{F}_q[[T]]$, which unlike the Hermite
normal form, recovers the Smith normal form. We use our normal form to give a
uniform approach to Solomon's result and a refinement of it due to
Petrogradsky, which counts finite-index submodules $M$ of $R^d$ such that
$R^d/M$ has a given module structure. Our normal form and Hermite's can be
interpreted as reduced Gr\""obner bases with respect to two different monomial
orders. Counting with our normal form gives rise to a ``total distance''
statistics $W$ and certain ``spiral shifting'' operators $g_1,\dots,g_d$ on the
set $X=\mathbb{N}^d$ of $d$-tuples of nonnegative integers. These combinatorial
structures are of independent interest. We show that these operators commute,
and collectively act on $X$ freely and transitively, which in particular gives
a nontrivial self-bijection on $\mathbb{N}^d$. We give a formula on how $g_j$
interacts with the $W$-statistics on $X$, leading to a rational formula for the
generating function for $W$-statistics over any forward orbit in $X$ under
these operators.

$\theta_{\mu e}$ and $\theta_{ee}$, excluding part of the parameter space

$\nu_e$ disappearance effects due to the full $3+1$ treatment of the analysis

eye toward using them with hard, >6 keV, x-rays in very low-rate experiments -
e.g. at signal rates <0.1/s/cm^2. Measured background event rates for a
detector with an unshielded 0.75 mm thick CdTe sensor on the experimental floor
at SPring-8 varied from 0.4/s/cm^2 with a 6 keV lower-level discriminator (LLD)
threshold to 0.2/s/cm^2 with a 75 keV LLD threshold. The background for a
detector with a 1 mm thick silicon sensor was smaller, ~0.08/s/cm^2 for a 3keV
threshold dropping to ~0.07/s/cm^2 at a 17 keV threshold. These rates are
dominated by terrestrial sources, such as gamma rays emitted from trace
impurities in concrete, with only a small contribution, <0.01/s/cm2, from
direct detection of cosmic ray muons (CRMs). 15 mm of Pb shielding reduces the
measured rates to < 0.05/s/cm2 in CdTe and to <0.02/s/cm^2 in 1 mm silicon.
Additional processing, ""time slicing"", as may be used in low-rate experiments
where backgrounds may be most problematic, is shown to reduce the background
rates further, to < 0.004/s/cm^2 with the silicon sensor, and to between 0.002
and 0.02/s/cm^2 for CdTe, where the exact value for CdTe depends sensitively on
the detector threshold, and the use of the retriggering and/or the use of dual
discriminator thresholds. Background rates are presented as functions of
discriminator threshold, shielding, and processing. We also discuss the
magnitude of, and the correction for, the limitation of the detector dynamic
range that can be introduced by the time slicing. Finally, we present one
example where time slicing was used.

learning object detection from a collection of low-cost datasets, each of which
is annotated for only a subset of all the object classes. A popular approach to
this problem is first to train teacher models and then to use their confident
predictions as pseudo ground-truth labels when training a student model. To
obtain the best result, however, thresholds for prediction confidence must be
adjusted. This process typically involves iterative search and repeated
training of student models and is time-consuming. Therefore, we develop a
method to optimize the thresholds without iterative optimization by maximizing
the $F_\beta$-score on a validation dataset, which measures the quality of
pseudo labels and can be measured without training a student model. We

active research, with most studies centering on app analysis through release
notes in the Apple App Store and tracking user reviews via issue trackers.
However, the correlation between these release notes and user reviews in App
Store remains understudied. $\textbf{Objective}$: In this paper, we introduce
$\textit{RoseMatcher}$, a novel automatic approach to match relevant user
reviews with app release notes and identify matched pairs with high confidence.
$\textbf{Methods}$: We collected 944 release notes and 1,046,862 user reviews
from 5 mobile apps in the Apple App Store as research data to evaluate the
effectiveness and accuracy of $\textit{RoseMatcher}$, and conducted deep
content analysis on matched pairs. $\textbf{Results}$: Our evaluation shows
that $\textit{RoseMatcher}$ can reach a hit ratio of 0.718 for identifying
relevant matched pairs, and with the manual labeling and content analysis of
984 relevant pairs, we identify 8 roles that user reviews play in app updates
according to the relationship between release notes and user reviews in the
relevant matched pairs. $\textbf{Conclusions}$: Our findings indicate that both
app development teams and users pay close attention to release notes and user
reviews, with release notes typically addressing feature requests, bug reports,
and complaints, and user reviews offering positive, negative, and constructive
feedback. Overall, the study highlights the importance of the communication
between app development teams and users in the release planning of mobile apps,
with relevant reviews tending to be posed within a short period before and
after the release of release notes, with the average time interval between the
post time of release notes and user reviews being approximately one year.

quality factor, free spectral range, and physical cavity length, but can also
lead to group delay response and mode interactions that are useful for
enhancing light-material interaction and dispersion engineering in nonlinear

resonators implemented by cascaded Sagnac loop reflectors (CSLRs) and
demonstrate its use for engineering the spectral profile of integrated photonic

the phase shifts along the connecting waveguides, we tailor mode splitting in
the CSLR resonators to achieve a wide range of filter shapes for diverse
applications including enhanced light trapping, flat-top filtering, Q factor
enhancement, and signal reshaping. We present the theoretical designs and
compare the performance of CSLR resonators with three, four, and eight SLRs

systems for road transport. The problem of vehicle lateral stability control is
addressed in this paper using active front wheel steering and individual
braking. Vehicle lateral stability control means keeping the vehicle yaw rate
and the vehicle side slip angle in desired values. For this reason, a
model-based controller is designed. The desired yaw rate is obtained from the
single track vehicle model and the desired side slip angle is chosen as zero.
Controller design consists of two parts, lower and upper controller parts.
Upper controller is designed based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) method.
This upper controller changes front wheel steering angles utilizing
steer-by-wire system and also it generates the required control moment for
stabilizing the yaw motion of the vehicle. Lower controller is an individual
braking algorithm. It determines the individual braking wheel. In this way, the
control moment can be applied to the vehicle. The designed controller is tested
using the nonlinear single track vehicle model and the higher fidelity CarMaker

systems and traffic surveillance systems. However, detecting lane is highly
challenging when the visibility of a road lane marking is low, obscured or
often invisible due to real-life challenging environment and adverse weather.
Most of the lane detection methods suffer from four types of challenges: (i)
light effects i.e. shadow, glare of light, reflection etc. created by different
light sources like streetlamp, tunnel-light, sun, wet road etc.; (ii) Obscured
visibility of eroded, blurred, dashed, colored and cracked lane caused by
natural disasters and adverse weather; (iii) lane marking occlusion by
different objects from surroundings; and (iv) presence of confusing lines e.g.,
guardrails, pavement marking, road divider etc. In this paper, we proposed a
simple, real-time, and robust lane detection and tracking method to detect and
track lane marking. Here, we introduced three key technologies. First, we
introduce a comprehensive intensity threshold range (CITR) to improve the
performance of the canny operator in detecting lane edges of different
intensity. Second, we propose a robust lane verification technique, the angle

verify the characteristics of lane marking and to prevent incorrect lane

evaluate the performance of the proposed method we used the DSDLDE [1] dataset

black holes, and consist of atomic nuclei, relativistic electrons, and magnetic
fields. In exceptional cases, radio galaxies attain cosmological, megaparsec
extents - and thus turn into giants. Giants embody the most extreme known
mechanism through which galaxies can impact the Cosmic Web around them. The
triggers of giant growth remain a mystery. Excitingly, new sensitive
low-frequency sky surveys hold promise to change this situation. In this work,
we perform a precision measurement of the distribution of giant growth's
central dynamical quantity: total length. We first construct a statistical
geometric framework for radio galaxies that is both rigorous and practical. We
then search the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey for giants, discovering 2060
previously unknown specimina: more than have been found in all preceding
literature combined. Spectacular discoveries include the longest giant hosted
by an elliptical galaxy, the longest giant hosted by a spiral galaxy, and 13
giants with an angular length larger than that of the full Moon. By combining
theory and observations - and carefully forward modelling selection effects -
we infer that giant radio galaxy lengths are well described by a Pareto
distribution with tail index $-3.5 \pm 0.5$. This finding is a new
observational constraint for models and simulations of radio galaxy growth. In
addition, for the first time, we determine the comoving number density of
giants, $5 \pm 2\ (100\ \mathrm{Mpc})^{-3}$, and the volume-filling fraction of
giant radio galaxy lobes in clusters and filaments, $5\substack{+8\\-2}\cdot
10^{-6}$. We conclude that giants are truly rare - not only from an
observational perspective, but also from a cosmological one. At any moment in
time, most clusters and filaments - the building blocks of the modern Cosmic
Web - do not harbour giants.

ISI-free wideband communication, by leveraging delay compensation and
path-based beamforming, rather than the conventional channel equalization or
multi-carrier transmission. In particular, when there exist a few strong
time-dispersive channel paths, DAM can effectively align different propagation
delays and achieve their constructive superposition, thus especially appealing
for intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs)-aided communications with
controllable multi-paths. In this paper, we apply DAM to multi-IRS aided
wideband communication and study its practical design and achievable
performance. We first provide an asymptotic analysis showing that when the
number of base station (BS) antennas is much larger than that of IRSs, an
ISI-free channel can be established with appropriate delay pre-compensation and
the simple path-based MRT beamforming. We then consider the general system
setup and study the problem of joint path-based beamforming and phase shifts
design for DAM transmission, by considering the three classical beamforming
techniques on a per-path basis, namely the low-complexity path-based MRT
beamforming, the path-based ZF beamforming for ISI-free DAM communication, and
the optimal path-based MMSE beamforming. As a comparison, OFDM-based multi-IRS
aided communication is considered. Simulation results demonstrate that DAM
outperforms OFDM in terms of spectral efficiency, BER, and PAPR.

hydrogenation and dehydrogenation kinetics and the high temperature of 300
$^\circ$C required for decomposition are major obstacles to small-scale
applications such as automobiles. The local electronic structure of
interstitial H in MgH$_2$ is an important fundamental knowledge in solving this

results of DFT calculations. We have therefore introduced muon (Mu) as pseudo-H
into MgH$_2$ and investigated the corresponding interstitial H states by
analyzing their electronic and dynamical properties in detail. As a result, we
observed multiple Mu states similar to those observed in wide-gap oxides, and
found that their electronic states can be attributed to relaxed-excited states
associated with donor/acceptor levels predicted by the recently proposed
""ambipolarity model"". This provides an indirect support for the DFT
calculations on which the model is based via the donor/acceptor levels. An
important implication of the muon results for improved hydrogen kinetics is
that dehydrogenation, serving as a $reduction$ for hydrides, stabilizes the

inefficiency and difficult generalization. Recently, Unsupervised Environment
Design (UED) emerged as a new paradigm for zero-shot generalization by
simultaneously learning a task distribution and agent policies on the generated
tasks. This is a non-stationary process where the task distribution evolves
along with agent policies; creating an instability over time. While past works
demonstrated the potential of such approaches, sampling effectively from the
task space remains an open challenge, bottlenecking these approaches. To this
end, we introduce CLUTR: a novel unsupervised curriculum learning algorithm
that decouples task representation and curriculum learning into a two-stage
optimization. It first trains a recurrent variational autoencoder on randomly
generated tasks to learn a latent task manifold. Next, a teacher agent creates
a curriculum by maximizing a minimax REGRET-based objective on a set of latent
tasks sampled from this manifold. Using the fixed-pretrained task manifold, we
show that CLUTR successfully overcomes the non-stationarity problem and
improves stability. Our experimental results show CLUTR outperforms PAIRED, a
principled and popular UED method, in the challenging CarRacing and navigation

applications. In the past decades, plenty of secure and privacy-preserving RFID
tag/mutual authentication protocols as well as formal frameworks for evaluating
them have been proposed. However, we notice that a property, namely proof of
possession (PoP), has not been rigorously studied till now, despite it has
significant value in many RFID applications. For example, in RFID-enabled
supply chains, PoP helps prevent dis-honest parties from publishing information
about products/tags that they actually have never processed.
  We propose the first formal framework for RFID tag/mutual authentication with
PoP after correcting deficiencies of some existing RFID formal frameworks. We
provide a generic construction to transform an RFID tag/mutual authentication
protocol to one that supports PoP using a cryptographic hash function, a
pseudorandom function (PRF) and a signature scheme. We prove that the
constructed protocol is secure and privacy-preserving under our framework if
all the building blocks possess desired security properties. Finally, we show
an RFID mutual authentication protocol with PoP. Arming tag/mutual
authentication protocols with PoP is an important step to strengthen
RFID-enabled systems as it bridges the security gap between physical layer and

on the Lipschitz constant of functions that fit the training data in terms of
their number of parameters. This raises an interesting open question, do -- and
can -- functions with more parameters, but not necessarily more computational
cost, have better robustness? We study this question for sparse Mixture of
Expert models (MoEs), that make it possible to scale up the model size for a
roughly constant computational cost. We theoretically show that under certain
conditions on the routing and the structure of the data, MoEs can have
significantly smaller Lipschitz constants than their dense counterparts. The
robustness of MoEs can suffer when the highest weighted experts for an input
implement sufficiently different functions. We next empirically evaluate the
robustness of MoEs on ImageNet using adversarial attacks and show they are
indeed more robust than dense models with the same computational cost. We make
key observations showing the robustness of MoEs to the choice of experts,

mechanics. For all elementary and quasiparticles observed to date - including
fermions, bosons, and Abelian anyons - this principle guarantees that the
braiding of identical particles leaves the system unchanged. However, in two
spatial dimensions, an intriguing possibility exists: braiding of non-Abelian
anyons causes rotations in a space of topologically degenerate wavefunctions.
Hence, it can change the observables of the system without violating the
principle of indistinguishability. Despite the well developed mathematical
description of non-Abelian anyons and numerous theoretical proposals, the
experimental observation of their exchange statistics has remained elusive for
decades. Controllable many-body quantum states generated on quantum processors
offer another path for exploring these fundamental phenomena. While efforts on
conventional solid-state platforms typically involve Hamiltonian dynamics of
quasi-particles, superconducting quantum processors allow for directly
manipulating the many-body wavefunction via unitary gates. Building on
predictions that stabilizer codes can host projective non-Abelian Ising anyons,
we implement a generalized stabilizer code and unitary protocol to create and
braid them. This allows us to experimentally verify the fusion rules of the
anyons and braid them to realize their statistics. We then study the prospect
of employing the anyons for quantum computation and utilize braiding to create
an entangled state of anyons encoding three logical qubits. Our work provides
new insights about non-Abelian braiding and - through the future inclusion of
error correction to achieve topological protection - could open a path toward
fault-tolerant quantum computing.

causal dynamics underlying users' decision making. Most existing literature
addresses this problem by using causal structures inferred from domain
knowledge. However, there are numerous phenomenons where domain knowledge is
insufficient, and the causal mechanisms must be learnt from the feedback data.
Discovering the causal mechanism from RS feedback data is both novel and
challenging, since RS itself is a source of intervention that can influence
both the users' exposure and their willingness to interact. Also for this
reason, most existing solutions become inappropriate since they require data
collected free from any RS. In this paper, we first formulate the underlying
causal mechanism as a causal structural model and describe a general causal
structure learning framework grounded in the real-world working mechanism of
RS. The essence of our approach is to acknowledge the unknown nature of RS
intervention. We then derive the learning objective from our framework and
propose an augmented Lagrangian solver for efficient optimization. We conduct
both simulation and real-world experiments to demonstrate how our approach
compares favorably to existing solutions, together with the empirical analysis

accuracy in zero- and few-shot settings while requiring few to no learned
task-specific parameters. Nevertheless, these methods still often trail behind
full model finetuning. In this work, we investigate if a dedicated continued
pretraining stage could improve ""promptability"", i.e., zero-shot performance
with natural language prompts or few-shot performance with prompt tuning. We
reveal settings where existing continued pretraining methods lack
promptability. We also identify current methodological gaps, which we fill with
thorough large-scale experiments. We demonstrate that a simple recipe,
continued pretraining that incorporates a trainable prompt during multi-task
learning, leads to improved promptability in both zero- and few-shot settings
compared to existing methods, up to 31% relative. On the other hand, we find
that continued pretraining using MAML-style meta-learning, a method that
directly optimizes few-shot promptability, yields subpar performance. We
validate our findings with two prompt tuning methods, and, based on our
results, we provide concrete recommendations to optimize promptability for
different use cases.

emotional valence using free energy increase (FI) when one tries changing one's

sensors are available in inexpensive cost ranges, especially in fish-finders,
where the transducers are usually mounted to the bottom of a boat and can
approach shallower depths than the ones attached to an Uncrewed Underwater
Vehicle (UUV) can. However, extracting 3D information from side-scan sonar
imagery is a difficult task because of its low signal-to-noise ratio and
missing angle and depth information in the imagery. Since most algorithms that
generate a 3D point cloud from side-scan sonar imagery use Shape from Shading

seafloor is smooth, is slowly changing in depth, or does not have identifiable
objects that make acoustic shadows. This paper introduces an efficient

This computation is done in a computationally efficient manner by leveraging
the geometry of the first sonar return combined with known positions provided
by GPS and down-scan sonar depth measurement at each data point. Additionally,
this paper implements another algorithm that uses a Convolutional Neural

a triangulation and clustering method integrates the DOA estimations of the

To transfer the multi-modal knowledge effectively, we perform fine-grained
information excavation to mine intra-modal discriminative clues and inter-modal
correspondences. Specifically, we first design a multi-grained global feature
learning module to fully mine intra-modal discriminative local information,
which can emphasize identity-related discriminative clues by enhancing the
interactions between global image (text) and informative local patches (words).
Secondly, cross-grained feature refinement (CFR) and fine-grained

cross-grained and fine-grained interactions between modalities, which can
filter out non-modality-shared image patches/words and mine cross-modal
correspondences from coarse to fine. CFR and FCD are removed during inference

nonperturbative way, we construct an effective holographic dual description
with an emergent extradimension identified with an RG scale. Taking the
large$-N$ limit, we obtain an equation of motion of an order-parameter field,
here the chiral condensate for our explicit demonstration. In particular, an
intertwined structure manifests between the first-order RG flow equations of
renormalized coupling functions and the second-order differential equation of
the order-parameter field, thus referred to as a nonperturbative RG-improved
mean-field theory. Assuming translational symmetry as a vacuum state, we solve
these nonlinear coupled mean-field equations based on a matching method between
UV- and IR-regional solutions. As a result, we find an RG flow from a
weakly-coupled chiral-symmetric UV fixed point to a strongly-correlated
chiral-symmetry broken IR fixed point, where the renormalized velocity of Dirac
fermions vanishes most rapidly and effective quantum mechanics appears at IR.
Furthermore, we translate these RG flows of coupling functions into those of
emergent metric tensors and extract out geometrical properties of the emergent
holographic spacetime constructed from the UV- and IR-regional solutions.
Surprisingly, we obtain the volume law of entanglement entropy in the
Ryu-Takayanagi formula, which implies appearance of a black hole type solution
in the limit of infinite cutoff even at zero temperature. We critically discuss
our field theoretic interpretation for this solution in terms of potentially
gapless multi-particle excitation spectra.

  Design",,,,,"cs.LG cs.GT stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study reserve price optimization in multi-phase second price auctions,
where seller's prior actions affect the bidders' later valuations through a
Markov Decision Process (MDP). Compared to the bandit setting in existing
works, the setting in ours involves three challenges. First, from the seller's
perspective, we need to efficiently explore the environment in the presence of
potentially nontruthful bidders who aim to manipulates seller's policy. Second,
we want to minimize the seller's revenue regret when the market noise
distribution is unknown. Third, the seller's per-step revenue is unknown,
nonlinear, and cannot even be directly observed from the environment.
  We propose a mechanism addressing all three challenges. To address the first
challenge, we use a combination of a new technique named ""buffer periods"" and
inspirations from Reinforcement Learning (RL) with low switching cost to limit
bidders' surplus from untruthful bidding, thereby incentivizing approximately
truthful bidding. The second one is tackled by a novel algorithm that removes
the need for pure exploration when the market noise distribution is unknown.
The third challenge is resolved by an extension of LSVI-UCB, where we use the
auction's underlying structure to control the uncertainty of the revenue
function. The three techniques culminate in the $\underline{\rm
C}$ontextual-$\underline{\rm L}$SVI-$\underline{\rm U}$CB-$\underline{\rm

\mathcal{O}}(H^{5/2}\sqrt{K})$ revenue regret when the market noise is known
and $\tilde{ \mathcal{O}}(H^{3}\sqrt{K})$ revenue regret when the noise is
unknown with no assumptions on bidders' truthfulness.

predator-prey dynamics. These effects have not been as well studied in the case

Lokta-Volterra competition models, where \emph{one} of the competitors is
""fearful"" of the other. We find that the presence of fear can have several
interesting dynamical effects on the classical scenarios of weak and strong
competition, and competitive exclusion. Notably, for fear levels in certain
regimes, we show bi-stability between interior equilibrium and boundary
equilibrium is possible - contrary to the classical strong competition
situation where bi-stability is only possible between boundary equilibrium.
Furthermore, in the spatially explicit setting, the effects of several
spatially heterogeneous fear functions are investigated. In particular, we show
that under certain $\mathbb{L}^{1}$ restrictions on the fear function, a weak
competition type situation can change to competitive exclusion. Applications of
these results to ecological as well as sociopolitical settings are discussed,
that connect to the ""landscape of fear"" (LOF) concept in ecology.

the many poorly constrained physical processes that come into play. We address
this problem using the semi-analytical code ""Cosmic Archaeology Tool"" (CAT).
CAT follows the evolution of dark matter halos tracking their merger history
and provides an ab initio description of their baryonic evolution, starting
from the formation of the first (Pop III) stars and black holes (BHs) in
mini-halos at z > 20. The model is anchored to observations of galaxies and AGN
at z < 6 and predicts a reionization history consistent with constraints. In
this work we compute the evolution of the mean global 21cm signal between
$4\leq z \leq 40$ based on the rate of formation and emission properties of
stars and accreting black holes. We obtain an absorption profile with a maximum
depth $\delta {\rm T_b} = -95$ mK at $z \sim 26.5$ (54 MHz). This feature is
quickly suppressed turning into an emission signal at $z = 20$ due to the
contribution of accreting BHs that efficiently heat the IGM at $z < 27$. The
high-$z$ absorption feature is caused by the early coupling between the spin
and kinetic temperature of the IGM induced by Pop III star formation episodes
in mini-halos. Once we account for an additional radio background from early
BHs, we are able to reproduce the timing and the depth of the EDGES signal only
if we consider a smaller X-ray background from accreting BHs, but not the
shape.

constrained torsional rigidity. In this situation, the relevant solution $u$
satisfies a Steklov condition on $T$ and a homogeneous Dirichlet condition on
$\Sigma = \partial\Omega \setminus \bar{T} \subset B_+$. We provide an integral
identity that relates (a symmetric function of) the second derivatives of the

significant consequence of this identity is a rigidity result under a quite
weak overdetermining integral condition for $u_\nu$ on $\Sigma$: in fact, it
turns out that $\Sigma$ must be a spherical cap that meets $T$ orthogonally.
This result returns the one obtained by J. Guo and C. Xia under the stronger
pointwise condition that the values of $u_\nu$ be constant on $\Sigma$. A
second important consequence is a set of stability bounds, which quantitatively
measure how $\Sigma$ is far uniformly from being a spherical cap, if $u_\nu$
deviates from a constant in the norm $L^1(\Sigma)$.

augmentation to improve the ASQP task. Specifically, we use the pre-trained

in conjunction with model-checking of formal specifications defined on an
abstract model of an autonomous system and its environment. In particular, we
define two metrics -- \emph{proposition-labeled} and \emph{class-labeled}
confusion matrices -- for evaluating object detection, and we incorporate these
metrics to compute the satisfaction probability of system-level safety
requirements. While confusion matrices have been effective for comparative
evaluation of classification and object detection models, our framework fills
two key gaps. First, we relate the performance of object detection to formal
requirements defined over downstream high-level planning tasks. In particular,
we provide empirical results that show that the choice of a good object
detection algorithm, with respect to formal requirements on the overall system,
significantly depends on the downstream planning and control design. Secondly,
unlike the traditional confusion matrix, our metrics account for variations in
performance with respect to the distance between the ego and the object being
detected. We demonstrate this framework on a car-pedestrian example by
computing the satisfaction probabilities for safety requirements formalized in
Linear Temporal Logic (LTL).

reactive test synthesis that ensures that the system meets the test

for pipelined executions on data streams. Developers often need to change the
computing logic of the job such as fixing a loophole in an operator or changing
the machine learning model in an operator with a cheaper model to handle a
sudden increase of the data-ingestion rate. Recently many systems have started
supporting runtime reconfigurations to allow this type of change on the fly
without killing and restarting the execution. While the delay in
reconfiguration is critical to performance, existing systems use epochs to do
runtime reconfigurations, which can cause a long delay. In this paper we
develop a new technique called Fries that leverages the emerging availability
of fast control messages in many systems, since these messages can be sent
without being blocked by data messages. We formally define consistency in
runtime reconfigurations, and develop a Fries scheduler with consistency
guarantees. The technique not only works for different classes of dataflows,
but also works for parallel executions and supports fault tolerance. Our
extensive experimental evaluation on clusters show the advantages of this
technique compared to epoch-based schedulers.

primarily covered the redshifted jet from RW Aur A, and the blueshifted jets
from RY Tau and DG Tau, to investigate long-term time variabilities potentially
related to the activities of mass accretion and/or the stellar magnetic fields.
All of these jets consist of several moving knots with tangential velocities of
70-240 km s-1, ejected from the star with different velocities and at irregular
time intervals. Via comparison with literature, we identify significant
differences in tangential velocities for the DG Tau jet between 1985-2008 and

in turn, their peak brightnesses in the 1.644-micron emission decreased up to a
factor of ~30 during the epochs of our observations. A variety of the decay
timescales measured in the [Fe II] 1.644 micron emission can be attributed to
different pre-shock conditions if the moving knots are unresolved shocks.

non-uniform density/temperature distributions with another heating mechanism,

requires different clients (e.g., Internet of Things devices) to participate in
the machine learning model training process by training and uploading their

models from all the clients, the FL server generates a global model by
aggregating the received local models. This traditional FL process may suffer
from the straggler problem in heterogeneous client settings, where the FL
server has to wait for slow clients to upload their local models in each global
iteration, thus increasing the overall training time. One of the solutions is
to set up a deadline and only the clients that can upload their local models
before the deadline would be selected in the FL process. This solution may lead
to a slow convergence rate and global model overfitting issues due to the
limited client selection. In this paper, we propose the Latency awarE
Semi-synchronous client Selection and mOdel aggregation for federated learNing

Extensive simulations have been conducted to compare the performance of LESSON

flexible and rigid polymer solutions. The flexible polymer is partially
hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) and the rigid polymer is xanthan gum (XG). The
experiments are carried out at low drag reduction ($\%DR < 40$), high drag
reduction ($\%DR > 40$) and maximum drag reduction (where the velocity profile
$U^+$ roughly matches Virk's asymptote). We compare velocity profiles,
streamwise and wall-normal Reynolds stresses and power spectra of streamwise
velocity fluctuations measured by Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA). Our results
show that the effects of both XG and HPAM polymers on turbulence are similar,
provided that the Reynolds numbers and $\%DR$ are also similar. At high levels
of $\%DR$, the power spectral densities of streamwise velocity fluctuations of
both XG and HPAM flows show a power-law decay near $-3$ instead of $-5/3$ in
the inertial range. A slope of the power spectra of $-3$ was recently
interpreted as evidence of elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT) in polymer jets. At
relatively low concentrations, we observe that flexible polymer solutions are
more effective at reducing drag, while XG only reaches MDR at very high
concentrations. Thus, we hypothesize that the formation of polymer aggregates
with higher concentrations contributes to increase viscoelasticity, and thus
$\%DR$, with XG and other rigid polymer solutions.

recommender systems is often hindered by the need for active user involvement.
To mitigate this issue, implicit feedback (e.g., clicks) generated during user
browsing is exploited as a viable substitute. However, implicit feedback
possesses a high degree of noise, which significantly undermines recommendation
quality. While many methods have been proposed to address this issue by
assigning varying weights to implicit feedback, two shortcomings persist: (1)
the weight calculation in these methods is iteration-independent, without
considering the influence of weights in previous iterations, and (2) the weight
calculation often relies on prior knowledge, which may not always be readily
available or universally applicable.
  To overcome these two limitations, we model recommendation denoising as a
bi-level optimization problem. The inner optimization aims to derive an
effective model for the recommendation, as well as guiding the weight
determination, thereby eliminating the need for prior knowledge. The outer
optimization leverages gradients of the inner optimization and adjusts the
weights in a manner considering the impact of previous weights. To efficiently
solve this bi-level optimization problem, we employ a weight generator to avoid
the storage of weights and a one-step gradient-matching-based loss to
significantly reduce computational time. The experimental results on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms both
state-of-the-art general and denoising recommendation models. The code is

process involved in the evaluation of upstream-downstream quantities. In this
work, we discuss several of these techniques, with a particular focus on the
shock obliquity (defined as the angle between the upstream magnetic field and
the shock normal vector) estimation. We introduce a systematic variation of the
upstream/downstream averaging windows, yielding to an ensemble of shock

approach is first tested with a synthetic shock, compliant with the
Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions for a shock, including the presence of noise
and disturbances. We then employ self-consistent, hybrid kinetic shock
simulations to apply the diagnostics to virtual spacecraft crossing the shock
front at various stages of its evolution, highlighting the role of
shock-induced fluctuations in the parameters estimation. This approach has the
strong advantage of retaining some important properties of collisionless shock
while being able to set a known, nominal set of shock parameters. Finally, two
recent observations of interplanetary shocks from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft
are presented, and the approach is also tested on an interplanetary shock

the feasible region shrinks toward the disjunctive and empty set, arise when
the perturbed parameter is close to zero. Hence, we propose a dedicated NLP
solver that maps the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker conditions into a system of

overdensity-based masses are $(6\sim8) \rm \times10^{14}\ M_\odot$, comparable
to the masses of large clusters at low redshift. The masses derived from
velocity dispersions are significantly lower, likely due to their diffuse and
low concentration features. Our result suggests the existence of a population
of large clusters with very diffuse X-ray emission that have been missed by
most previous searches using the RASS images. If most of the 303 candidates in
the previous catalog are confirmed to be real clusters, this may help to reduce
the discrepancy of cosmological results between the CMB and galaxy cluster
measurements.

vanilla transformers. However, they usually suffer from degraded performances
on various tasks and corpus. In this paper, we examine existing kernel-based
linear transformers and identify two key issues that lead to such performance
gaps: 1) unbounded gradients in the attention computation adversely impact the
convergence of linear transformer models; 2) attention dilution which trivially
distributes attention scores over long sequences while neglecting neighbouring
structures. To address these issues, we first identify that the scaling of
attention matrices is the devil in unbounded gradients, which turns out
unnecessary in linear attention as we show theoretically and empirically. To
this end, we propose a new linear attention that replaces the scaling operation
with a normalization to stabilize gradients. For the issue of attention
dilution, we leverage a diagonal attention to confine attention to only
neighbouring tokens in early layers. Benefiting from the stable gradients and
improved attention, our new linear transformer model, transNormer, demonstrates
superior performance on text classification and language modeling tasks, as
well as on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark, surpassing vanilla
transformer and existing linear variants by a clear margin while being
significantly more space-time efficient. The code is available at

to generate a production of primordial black holes. We study the cases with (i)
a linear holomorphic function, (ii) a quadratic holomorphic function, and (iii)

coarse-grained attention for music generation. Specifically, with the
fine-grained attention, a token of a specific bar directly attends to all the
tokens of the bars that are most relevant to music structures (e.g., the
previous 1st, 2nd, 4th and 8th bars, selected via similarity statistics); with
the coarse-grained attention, a token only attends to the summarization of the
other bars rather than each token of them so as to reduce the computational
cost. The advantages are two-fold. First, it can capture both music
structure-related correlations via the fine-grained attention, and other
contextual information via the coarse-grained attention. Second, it is
efficient and can model over 3X longer music sequences compared to its
full-attention counterpart. Both objective and subjective experimental results
demonstrate its ability to generate long music sequences with high quality and

events, we have calculated the propagated spectra in the circumstellar disc
considering the relevant energy loss processes. We have considered fluxes of
energetic particles with different spectral indices and different disc magnetic
configurations, generated at different positions from the star considering the
physical properties of the flares as deduced from the observations obtained by
the Chandra Orion Ultra Deep point source catalogue. We have then computed the
ionisation rates for a disc whose structure has been calculated with the
radiation thermo-chemical code {\tt ProDiMo}. We find that energetic particles
are potentially a very strong source of local ionisation with ionisation rates
exceeding by several orders of magnitude the contribution due to X-rays,
stellar energetic particles and radioactivity in the inner disc.

improve prediction accuracy. For highly nonlinear problems with insufficient
data set, the prediction accuracy of NN models becomes unstable, resulting in a
decrease in the accuracy of ensembles. Therefore, this study proposes a
frequency distribution-based ensemble that identifies core prediction values,
which are expected to be concentrated near the true prediction value. The
frequency distribution-based ensemble classifies core prediction values
supported by multiple prediction values by conducting statistical analysis with
a frequency distribution, which is based on various prediction values obtained
from a given prediction point. The frequency distribution-based ensemble can
improve predictive performance by excluding prediction values with low accuracy
and coping with the uncertainty of the most frequent value. An adaptive
sampling strategy that sequentially adds samples based on the core prediction
variance calculated as the variance of the core prediction values is proposed
to improve the predictive performance of the frequency distribution-based
ensemble efficiently. Results of various case studies show that the prediction
accuracy of the frequency distribution-based ensemble is higher than that of
Kriging and other existing ensemble methods. In addition, the proposed adaptive
sampling strategy effectively improves the predictive performance of the
frequency distribution-based ensemble compared with the previously developed
space-filling and prediction variance-based strategies.

online matching literature. They achieve the same optimal competitive ratio of
$1-1/e$ for the integral version and fractional version of online bipartite
matching by Karp, Vazirani, and Vazirani (STOC 1990) respectively. The two
algorithms have been generalized to weighted online bipartite matching
problems, including vertex-weighted online bipartite matching and AdWords, by
utilizing a perturbation function. The canonical choice of the perturbation
function is $f(x)=1-e^{x-1}$ as it leads to the optimal competitive ratio of
$1-1/e$ in both settings.
  We advance the understanding of the weighted generalizations of Ranking and
Balance in this paper, with a focus on studying the effect of different
perturbation functions. First, we prove that the canonical perturbation
function is the \emph{unique} optimal perturbation function for vertex-weighted
online bipartite matching. In stark contrast, all perturbation functions
achieve the optimal competitive ratio of $1-1/e$ in the unweighted setting.
Second, we prove that the generalization of Ranking to AdWords with unknown
budgets using the canonical perturbation function is at most $0.624$
competitive, refuting a conjecture of Vazirani (2021). More generally, as an
application of the first result, we prove that no perturbation function leads
to the prominent competitive ratio of $1-1/e$ by establishing an upper bound of
$1-1/e-0.0003$.
  Finally, we propose the online budget-additive welfare maximization problem
that is intermediate between AdWords and AdWords with unknown budgets, and we
design an optimal $1-1/e$ competitive algorithm by generalizing Balance.

matching perspective to this ubiquitous problem, whereby each node is either
matched into an anchor in a virtual universe graph or regarded as an outlier.
Such a universe matching scheme enjoys a few important merits, which have not
been adopted in existing learning-based graph matching (GM) literature. First,
the subtle logic for inlier matching and outlier detection can be clearly
modeled, which is otherwise less convenient to handle in the pairwise matching
scheme. Second, it enables end-to-end learning especially for universe level
affinity metric learning for inliers matching, and loss design for gathering

pre-trained on source domains to target domains. The challenges stem from the
distribution shift from the source to the target domain, coupled with the
unavailability of any source data and labeled target data for optimization.
Rather than fine-tuning the model by updating the parameters, we propose to
perturb the source model to achieve adaptation to target domains. We introduce
perturbations into the model parameters by variational Bayesian inference in a
probabilistic framework. By doing so, we can effectively adapt the model to the
target domain while largely preserving the discriminative ability. Importantly,
we demonstrate the theoretical connection to learning Bayesian neural networks,
which proves the generalizability of the perturbed model to target domains. To
enable more efficient optimization, we further employ a parameter sharing
strategy, which substantially reduces the learnable parameters compared to a
fully Bayesian neural network. Our model perturbation provides a new
probabilistic way for domain adaptation which enables efficient adaptation to
target domains while maximally preserving knowledge in source models.
Experiments on several source-free benchmarks under three different evaluation
settings verify the effectiveness of the proposed variational model
perturbation for source-free domain adaptation.

resonance imaging (MRI) development. However, even with the graphics processing
unit (GPU) acceleration, the heavy computational load remains a major
challenge, especially in large-scale, high-accuracy simulation scenarios. This
work aims to develop a deep learning-based simulator to accelerate Bloch
simulation. Approach: The simulator model, called Simu-Net, is based on an
end-to-end convolutional neural network and is trained with synthetic data
generated by traditional Bloch simulation. It uses dynamic convolution to fuse
spatial and physical information with different dimensions and introduces
position encoding templates to achieve position-specific labeling and overcome
the receptive field limitation of the convolutional network. Main Results:
Compared with mainstream GPU-based MRI simulation software, Simu-Net
successfully accelerates simulations by hundreds of times in both traditional
and advanced MRI pulse sequences. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed
framework were verified qualitatively and quantitatively. Besides, the trained
Simu-Net was applied to generate sufficient customized training samples for
deep learning-based T2 mapping and comparable results to conventional methods
were obtained in the human brain. Significance: As a proof-of-concept work,
Simu-Net shows the potential to apply deep learning for rapidly approximating
the forward physical process of MRI and may increase the efficiency of Bloch
simulation for optimization of MRI pulse sequences and deep learning-based
methods.

  Society of America for publication",,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Frictional heat during earthquake rupture raises the pressure of fault zone
fluids and affects the rupture process and its seismic radiation. Here, we
investigate the role of two key parameters governing thermal-pressurization of
pore fluids -- hydraulic diffusivity and shear-zone half-width -- on earthquake
rupture dynamics, kinematic source properties and ground-motions. We conduct 3D
strike-slip dynamic rupture simulations assuming a rate-and-state dependent
friction law with strong velocity-weakening coupled to thermal-pressurization
of pore fluids. Dynamic rupture evolution and ground-shaking are densely
evaluated across the fault and Earth surface to analyze variations of rupture
parameters (slip, peak slip-rate PSR, rupture speed Vr, rise time Tr),
correlations among rupture parameters, and variability of peak ground velocity
(PGV).
  Our simulations reveal how variations in thermal-pressurization affect source
properties. We find that mean slip and Tr decrease with increasing hydraulic
diffusivity, whereas mean Vr and PSR remain almost constant. Mean slip, PSR and
Vr decrease with increasing shear-zone half-width, whereas mean Tr increases.
Shear-zone half-width distinctly affects the correlation between rupture
parameters, especially for parameter pairs slip-Vr, PSR-Vr and Vr-Tr. Hydraulic
diffusivity has negligible effects on these correlations. Variations in
shear-zone half-width primarily impact Vr, which then may affect other rupture
parameters. We find negative correlation between slip and PSR, in contrast to
simpler dynamic rupture models, whereas trends for other parameter pairs are in
agreement. Mean PGVs decrease faster with increasing shear-zone half-width than
with hydraulic diffusivity, whereas ground-motion variability is similarly
affected by both parameters.

regression or classification. They are popular due to their good predictive
performance (compared to, e.g., decision trees) requiring only minimal tuning
of hyperparameters. They are built via aggregation of multiple regression trees
during training and are usually calculated recursively using hard splitting
rules. Recently regression forests have been incorporated into the framework of
distributional regression, a nowadays popular regression approach aiming at
estimating complete conditional distributions rather than relating the mean of
an output variable to input features only - as done classically. This article
proposes a new type of a distributional regression tree using a multivariate
soft split rule. One great advantage of the soft split is that smooth
high-dimensional functions can be estimated with only one tree while the
complexity of the function is controlled adaptive by information criteria.
Moreover, the search for the optimal split variable is obsolete. We show by
means of extensive simulation studies that the algorithm has excellent
properties and outperforms various benchmark methods, especially in the
presence of complex non-linear feature interactions. Finally, we illustrate the
usefulness of our approach with an example on probabilistic forecasts for the

functions over odd characteristic finite fields have been investigated in the
literature, and their differential spectra were determined. The differential
uniformity of the power function $F(x)=x^{\frac{p^{n}-3}{2}}$ over the finite
field $F_{p^n}$ of order $p^n$ (where $p$ is an odd prime), was studied by
Helleseth and Sandberg in 1997, where $p^n\equiv3\pmod{4}$ is an odd prime
power with $p^n>7$. It was shown that $F$ is PN when $p^n=27$, APN when $5$ is
a nonsquare in $F_{p^n}$, and differentially $3$-uniform when $5$ is a square
in $F_{p^n}$. In this paper, by investigating some equation systems and certain
character sums over $F_{p^n}$, the differential spectrum of $F$ is completely
determined. We focusing on the power functions $x^d$ with even $d$ over
$F_{p^n}$ ($p$ odd), the power functions $F$ we consider are APN which are of
the lowest differential uniformity and the nontrivial differential spectrum.
Moreover, we examine the extension of the so-called $c$-differential uniformity
by investigating the $c$-differential properties of $F$. Specifically, an upper
bound of the $c$-differential uniformity of $F$ is given, and its
$c$-differential spectrum is considered in the case where $c=-1$. Finally, we
emphasize that, throughout our study of the differential spectrum of the
considered power functions, we provide methods for evaluating sums of specific
characters with connections to elliptic curves and for determining the number
of solutions of specific systems of equations over finite fields.

Lemaitre-Tolman (LT) model showing how the prediction of the model changes when
the equation of state parameter ($w$) of dark energy is modified. In the
previous study, it was considered that dark energy was merely constituted by
the cosmological constant. In this paper, as in the previous study, we also
took into account the effect of angular momentum and dynamical friction
($J\eta$ LT model) that modifies the evolution of a perturbation, initially
moving with the Hubble flow. As a first step, solving the equation of motion,
we calculated the relationship between mass, $M$, and the turn-around radius,
$R_0$. If one knows the value of the turn-around radius $R_0$, it is possible
to obtain the mass of the studied objects. As a second step, we build up, as in
the previous paper, a relationship between the velocity, $v$, and radius, $R$.
The relation was fitted to data of groups and clusters. Since the relationship
$v-R$ depends on the Hubble constant and the mass of the object, we obtained
optimized values of the two parameters of the objects studied. The mass
decreases of a factor of maximum 25\% comparing the $J\eta$ LT results (for
which $w=-1$) and the case $w=-1/3$, while the Hubble constant increases going
from $w=-1$ to $w=-1/3$. Finally, the obtained values of the mass, $M$, and
$R_0$ of the studied objects can put constraints to the dark energy equation of
state parameter, $w$.

  arXiv:2206.14407",,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The stabilization of ""rigid"" flute and ballooning modes $m = 1$ in an
axisymmetric mirror trap with the help of an ideally conducting lateral wall is
studied both in the presence and in the absence of end MHD anchors. The
calculations were performed for an anisotropic plasma in a model that simulates
the pressure distribution during the injection of beams of fast neutral atoms
into the magnetic field minimum at a right angle to the trap axis. It was
assumed that the lateral wall has the shape of a straight cylinder while
earlier studies were performed for a proportional chamber, which, on an
enlarged scale, repeats the shape of the plasma column. Proportional chamber is
more effective as a means of MHD stabilization, it is more convenient for
numerical simulation but it is more difficult for manufacturing.
  It has been found that for the effective stabilization of the listed modes by
an ideally conducting lateral wall, the parameter beta ($\beta$, the ratio of
the plasma pressure to the magnetic field pressure) must exceed some critical
value $\beta_{\text{crit}}$. When conducting lateral wall is combined with
conducting end plates imitating MHD end stabilizers, there are two critical
beta values and two stability zones $\beta<\beta_{\text{ crit}1}$ and $\beta >
\beta_{\text {crit}2}$ that can merge, making the entire range of allowable
beta values $0<\beta<1$ stable.
  The dependence of the critical betas on the degree of plasma anisotropy, the
mirror ratio, and the width of the vacuum gap between the plasma and the
lateral wall is studied. In contrast to the works of other authors devoted to
the plasma model with a sharp boundary, we calculated the boundaries of the
stability zone for a number of diffuse radial pressure profiles and several
axial magnetic field profiles.

crystallized or fully crystallized materials with novel structural and magnetic
properties. The development of desired and tunable properties of such systems
drives the need to understand the mechanism of their thermal evolution at the
atomic level. Co-sputtered amorphous Ni-Zr alloy thin films which were
thermally annealed in steps of 200 deg C from room temperature up to 800 deg C,
were observed to undergo an amorphous-to-crystalline transformation. Evolutions
in local atomic structure, including oxide formation and depletion during this
devitrification process, were determined using a combination of X-ray
reflectivity (XRR), grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and Extended
X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) techniques. The most probable phase of
the alloy was determined as Ni7Zr2; undergoing a polymorphous transformation.
The slight oxide content in the films was also noted to decrease rapidly as
annealing proceeded; leaving the crystallization pathway unhindered. Modelling
and analyses of XRR and GIXRD data showed that film thickness decreased with
annealing while long range order increased. Pair distribution function peak
widths were observed to decrease with annealing, indicating a control over
structural disorder in the system as it transitioned from the amorphous to
crystalline state. Partial atomic distribution in the environment of each
constituent was examined at every stage of annealing through EXAFS
measurements, which gave proper insight into atomic scale changes to the order
present. Detailed analyses through these techniques gave coherent results, thus
providing a true picture of the thermal evolution process of devitrification in
this technologically useful material.

for its ability to enhance the performance of not only the wireless
communication but also the indoor localization with low-cost. This paper
investigates the performance limits of the RIS-based near-field localization in
the asynchronous scenario, and analyzes the impact of each part of the cascaded
channel on the localization performance. The Fisher information matrix (FIM)
and the position error bound (PEB) are derived. Besides, we also derive the
equivalent Fisher information (EFI) for the position-related intermediate
parameters. Enabled by the derived EFI, we verify that both the ranging and
bearing information of the user can be obtained when the near-field model is
considered for the RIS-User equipment (UE) part of the channel, while only the
direction of the UE can be inferred in the far-field scenario. This result is
well known in the scenario that the curvature of arrival (COA) is directly
sensed by the traditional active large-scale array, and we prove that it still
holds when the COA is sensed passively by the large RIS. For the base station
(BS)-RIS part of the channel, we reveal that this part of the channel
determines the type of the gain provided by the BS antenna array. Besides, in
the single-carrier, single snapshot case, it requires both the BS-RIS and the
RIS-UE part of the channel works in the near-field scenario to localize the UE.
We also show that the well-known focusing control scheme for RIS, which
maximizes the received SNR, is not always a good choice and may degrade the
localization performance in the asynchronous scenario. The simulation results
validate the analytic work. The impact of the focusing control scheme on the
PEB performances under synchronous and asynchronous conditions is also
investigated.

segmentation and circle fitting. Conventional iris localization methods first
extract iris regions by using semantic segmentation methods such as U-Net.
Afterward, the inner and outer iris circles are localized using the traditional
circle fitting algorithm. However, this approach requires high-resolution
encoder-decoder networks for iris segmentation, so it causes computational
costs to be high. In addition, traditional circle fitting tends to be sensitive
to noise in input images and fitting parameters, causing the iris recognition
performance to be poor. To solve these problems, we propose an iris
localization network (ILN), that can directly localize pupil and iris circles
with eyelid points from a low-resolution iris image. We also introduce a pupil
refinement network (PRN) to improve the accuracy of pupil localization.
Experimental results show that the combination of ILN and PRN works in 34.5 ms
for one iris image on a CPU, and its localization performance outperforms
conventional iris segmentation methods. In addition, generalized evaluation
results show that the proposed method has higher robustness for datasets in
different domain than other segmentation methods. Furthermore, we also confirm
that the proposed ILN and PRN improve the iris recognition accuracy.

particles along a 1D chain of $n$ sites. It has been extensively used to study
ribosome flow along the mRNA molecule during translation. When the transition
rates along the chain are time-varying and jointly $T$-periodic the RFM
entrains, i.e., every trajectory of the RFM converges to a unique $T$-periodic
solution that depends on the transition rates, but not on the initial
condition. In general, entrainment to periodic excitations like the 24h solar
day or the 50Hz frequency of the electric grid is important in numerous natural
and artificial systems. An interesting question, called the gain of entrainment
(GOE) in the RFM, is whether proper coordination of the periodic translation
rates along the mRNA can lead to a larger average protein production rate.
Analyzing the GOE in the RFM is non-trivial and partial results exist only for
the RFM with dimensions $n=1,2$. We use a new approach to derive several
results on the GOE in the general $n$-dimensional RFM. Perhaps surprisingly, we
rigorously characterize several cases where there is no GOE, so to maximize the
average production rate in these cases, the best choice is to use constant
transition rates all along the chain.

$\sigma_{0}|\mu|^{d-1}\delta(\omega)$, respectively, where $\omega$ is the

one dimension due to lacking of extra spatial dimension. The angular dependence
of LOCs is found to characterize the band tilting, and the constant asymptotic

a ratio that consists of Fermi velocities. The findings are valid for a great

quantity of interest, typically expressed as an integral. This article
introduces a type of shape calculus based on localized dilation of boundary
faces through perturbations of a level-set function. The calculus is tailored
for shape optimization problems where a partial differential equation is
numerically solved using a fictitious-domain method. That is, the boundary of a
domain is allowed to cut arbitrarily through a computational mesh, which is
held fixed throughout the computations. Directional derivatives of a volume or
surface integral using the new shape calculus yields purely boundary-supported
expressions, and the involved integrands are only required to be element-wise
smooth. However, due to this low regularity, only one-sided differentiability
can be guaranteed in general. The dilation concept introduced here differs from
the standard approach to shape calculus, which is based on domain
transformations. The use of domain transformations is closely linked the the
use of traditional body-fitted discretization approaches, where the
computational mesh is deformed to conform to the changing domain shape. The
directional derivatives coming out of a shape calculus using deforming meshes
under domain transformations are different then the ones from the
boundary-dilation approach using fixed meshes; the former are not purely
boundary supported but contain information also from the interior.

depths for panoramas that is significantly faster and qualitatively and
qualitatively more accurate than the current state-of-the-art method
(360MonoDepth). As traditional neural network-based methods have limitations in
the output image sizes (up to 1024x512) due to GPU memory constraints, both
360MonoDepth and our method rely on stitching multiple perspective disparity or
depth images to come out a unified panoramic depth map. However, to achieve
globally consistent stitching, 360MonoDepth relied on solving extensive
disparity map alignment and Poisson-based blending problems, leading to high
computation time. Instead, we propose to use an existing panoramic depth map
(computed in real-time by any panorama-based method) as the common target for
the individual perspective depth maps to register to. This key idea made
producing globally consistent stitching results from a straightforward task.
Our experiments show that our method generates qualitatively better results
than existing panorama-based methods, and further outperforms them
quantitatively on datasets unseen by these methods.

to investigate how to combine the strengths of autoregressive and

through synthetic experiments that prompting a small number of AT's predictions
can promote one-shot non-autoregressive translation to achieve the equivalent
performance of IR-NAT. Following this line, we propose a new two-stage
translation prototype called hybrid-regressive translation (HRT). Specifically,
HRT first generates discontinuous sequences via autoregression (e.g., make a
prediction every k tokens, k>1) and then fills in all previously skipped tokens
at once in a non-autoregressive manner. We also propose a bag of techniques to
effectively and efficiently train HRT without adding any model parameters. HRT
achieves the state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.49 on the WMT En-De task and is
at least 1.5x faster than AT, regardless of batch size and device. In addition,
another bonus of HRT is that it successfully inherits the good characteristics

the vanilla HRT with a 6-layer encoder and 6-layer decoder, the inference speed
of HRT with a 12-layer encoder and 1-layer decoder is further doubled on both

the observed extinction for four model permutations, using 232 sets of
silicates, graphite, carbon abundance in hydrocarbon molecules ($b_C$), and
fraction of iron abundance in free-flying nanoparticles ($b_{\text{Fe}}$).
These four different permutations were chosen to test iron nanoparticles
significance and carbon abundance in hydrocarbons. Our results indicate that
iron nanoparticles contribution is insignificant and there is a degeneracy of
carbon abundances, with the range $(0.0 \leq b_C \leq 0.7)\times10^{-5}$
providing the best-fit to the observed extinction curve of GRB 180325A. We
therefore favour the simplest model of silicates and polycyclic aromatic

wavelength range of the GRB extinction curve while graphite contributes towards
both the 2175 \r{A} bump and the UV extinction. The afterglow peak luminosity
($1.5\times10^{51}$ ergs/s) indicates dust destruction may have taken place. We
conclude that further investigations into other potential contributors of

  Segmentation","Accepted to BMVC 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Semi-supervised learning (SSL) can reduce the need for large labelled
datasets by incorporating unlabelled data into the training. This is
particularly interesting for semantic segmentation, where labelling data is
very costly and time-consuming. Current SSL approaches use an initially
supervised trained model to generate predictions for unlabelled images, called
pseudo-labels, which are subsequently used for training a new model from
scratch. Since the predictions usually do not come from an error-free neural
network, they are naturally full of errors. However, training with partially
incorrect labels often reduce the final model performance. Thus, it is crucial
to manage errors/noise of pseudo-labels wisely. In this work, we use three
mechanisms to control pseudo-label noise and errors: (1) We construct a solid
base framework by mixing images with cow-patterns on unlabelled images to
reduce the negative impact of wrong pseudo-labels. Nevertheless, wrong
pseudo-labels still have a negative impact on the performance. Therefore, (2)
we propose a simple and effective loss weighting scheme for pseudo-labels
defined by the feedback of the model trained on these pseudo-labels. This
allows us to soft-weight the pseudo-label training examples based on their
determined confidence score during training. (3) We also study the common
practice to ignore pseudo-labels with low confidence and empirically analyse
the influence and effect of pseudo-labels with different confidence ranges on
SSL and the contribution of pseudo-label filtering to the achievable
performance gains. We show that our method performs superior to state
of-the-art alternatives on various datasets. Furthermore, we show that our
findings also transfer to other tasks such as human pose estimation. Our code

artifact-free MRI images from highly undersampled k-space data. Recently,
implicit neural representation (INR) has emerged as a new deep learning
paradigm for learning the internal continuity of an object. In this study, we
adopted INR to parallel MRI reconstruction. The MRI image was modeled as a
continuous function of spatial coordinates. This function was parameterized by
a neural network and learned directly from the measured k-space itself without
additional fully sampled high-quality training data. Benefitting from the
powerful continuous representations provided by INR, the proposed method
outperforms existing methods by suppressing the aliasing artifacts and noise,
especially at higher acceleration rates and smaller sizes of the
auto-calibration signals. The high-quality results and scanning specificity
make the proposed method hold the potential for further accelerating the data
acquisition of parallel MRI.

  Whether the declining IR brightness is because of dust grains being destroyed

orbital period of 2.61595 days. With our 272 spectral energy distributions from
simultaneous BVRIJHK measures, the companion star has a temperature of
6200$\pm$500 K. Our century-long average in quiescence has V=14.5. With the
Gaia distance (5110$^{+920}_{-430}$ parsecs), the absolute magnitude is
+0.7$\pm$0.3. We converted this absolute magnitude (corrected to the disc light
alone) to accretion rates, with a full integration of the alpha-disc model.
This accretion rate is very high at 3.5x10$^{-7}$ solar masses per year. Our
search and analysis of archival photographs shows that no eruption occurred
from 1928--1954 or after 1969. With our analysis of the optical light curve,
the X-ray light curve, and the radial velocity curve, we derive a white dwarf
mass of 1.25$\pm$0.03 solar masses. With the high white dwarf mass and
very-high accretion rate, KT Eri must require a short time to accumulate the
required mass to trigger the next nova event. Our detailed calculations give a
recurrence time-scale of 12 years with a total range of 5--50 years. When
combined with the archival constraints, we conclude that the recurrence
time-scale must be between 40--50 years. So, KT Eri is certainly a recurrent

application of PC and MP embedded in a two-layer control framework is assessed
with mesoscopic simulation. Aiming at reducing implementation cost of MP
without significant performance loss, we propose a method to identify critical
nodes for partial MP deployment. A modified version of Store-and-forward
paradigm incorporating finite queue and spill-back consideration is used to
test different configurations of the proposed framework, for a real large-scale
network, in moderately and highly congested scenarios. Results show that: (i)
combined control of MP and PC outperforms separate MP and PC applications in
both demand scenarios; (ii) MP control in reduced critical node sets leads to
similar or even better performance compared to full-network implementation,
thus allowing for significant cost reduction; iii) the proposed control schemes
improve system performance even under demand fluctuations of up to 20% of mean.

subsequent rule-breaking behavior in shorter threads (20 or fewer comments),

group fairness criteria. Which one of these criteria is the morally most
appropriate one depends on the context, and its choice requires an ethical

elements: (a) a framework for the moral assessment of what fairness means in a
given context, based on the recently proposed general principle of ""Fair
equality of chances"" (FEC) (b) a mapping of the assessment's results to
established statistical group fairness criteria, and (c) a method for
integrating the thus-defined fairness into optimal decision making. As a second
contribution, we show new applications of the FEC principle and show that, with
this extension, the FEC framework covers all types of group fairness criteria:
independence, separation, and sufficiency. Third, we introduce an extended
version of the FEC principle, which additionally allows accounting for morally
irrelevant elements of the fairness assessment and links to well-known
relaxations of the fairness criteria. This paper presents a framework to
develop fair decision systems in a conceptually sound way, combining the moral

from small to large WHs which behaves like the liquid $-$ gas phase transition
at negative temperature, $T<0$, and, at the same time, its entropy equals with
minus sign the entropy of BH. As a consequence, the latent heat $\Delta
H_{WH}(T)$ which releases in this process equals with minus sign the latent

complex mechanics, traffic is described by various periodic phenomena. Workday
flow distributions in the morning and evening commuting times can be exploited
to make traffic adaptive and robust to disruptions. Additionally, controlling
traffic is also based on a periodic process, choosing the phase of green time
to allocate to opposite directions right of the pass and complementary red time
phase for adjacent directions. In our work, we consider a novel system for road
traffic control based on a network of interacting oscillators. Such a model has
the advantage to capture temporal and spatial interactions of traffic light
phasing as well as the network-level evolution of the traffic macroscopic

the antifragile control framework to control a network of interacting

the performance of the following multi-Gaussian transforms: rotation based
iterative Gaussianisation, projection pursuit multivariate transform and flow
transformation. Case studies with bivariate complexities are used to evaluate
and compare the realisations of the transformed values. For this purpose,
commonly used geostatistical validation metrics are applied, including
multivariate normality tests, reproduction of bivariate relationships, and
histogram and variogram validation. Based on most of the metrics, all three

Thermal conduction can be one of the effective factors in the energy
transportation of ADAFs; hence it may indirectly affect the dynamics of clumps
by means of a contact force between them and their host medium. We first study
the ensemble of clumps by assuming them as collision-less particles and
secondly we find the orbital motion of these clouds as individuals. For both
parts, clumps are subject to the gravity of the central object and a drag
force. The strong coupling between clumps and ADAF leads to equality between
the average treatment of the clumps and the dynamics of their background. By
employing the collision-less Boltzmann equation we calculate the velocity
dispersion of the clumps which turns out approximately one order of magnitude
higher than the ADAF. In fact, involving drag force in such a system causes the
angular momentum of the clumps can be transported outwards by the ADAF, and
hence the clouds eventually will be captured at the tidal radius. The results
show that the presence of thermal conduction increases the root of the averaged
radial velocity square and this in turn speeds up the process of capturing the
clouds through the tidal force. In the end, we focus on a typical individual
cloud, the spiral orbits appear thanks to only the toroidal component of
friction force. The parametric study again proves that the operation of thermal
conduction helps for decreasing the lifetime of clumps.

as a function of the inverse magnetic field. These oscillations are usually
considered to be a property of the Fermi surface and, hence, a metallic
property. Recently, however, such oscillations have been shown to arise, both
experimentally and theoretically, in certain insulators which have a narrow gap
and an inverted band structure. In this work, we develop a theory to study the
effect of many-body interaction on these unconventional oscillations,
perturbatively to leading order in the interaction strength. We find that
interaction has an unusual effect on oscillations in insulators: It may enhance
the amplitude in contrast to that in metals where it typically reduces the
amplitude. The enhancement occurs both at zero and nonzero temperature and can
be substantial in the regime where the gap parameter is comparable to the
Landau level spacing.

realize a quantum processor. A better knowledge of the noise sources affecting
the coherence of such a qubit is therefore of prime importance. In this work,
we study the effect of telegraphic noise induced by the fluctuation of a single
electric charge. We simulate as realistically as possible a hole spin qubit in
a quantum dot defined electrostatically by a set of gates along a silicon
nanowire channel. Calculations combining Poisson and time-dependent
Schr\""odinger equations allow to simulate the relaxation and the dephasing of
the hole spin as a function of time for a classical random telegraph signal. We
show that dephasing time $T_2$ is well given by a two-level model in a wide
range of frequency. Remarkably, in the most realistic configuration of a low
frequency fluctuator, the system has a non-Gaussian behavior in which the phase
coherence is lost as soon as the fluctuator has changed state. The Gaussian
description becomes valid only beyond a threshold frequency $\omega_{th}$, when
the two-level system reacts to the statistical distribution of the fluctuator
states. We show that the dephasing time $T_{2}(\omega_{th})$ at this threshold
frequency can be considerably increased by playing on the orientation of the
magnetic field and the gate potentials, by running the qubit along ""sweet""
lines. However, $T_{2}(\omega_{th})$ remains bounded due to dephasing induced
by the non-diagonal terms of the stochastic perturbation Hamiltonian. Our
simulations reveal that the spin relaxation cannot be described cleanly in the
two-level model because the coupling to higher energy hole levels impacts very
strongly the spin decoherence. This result suggests that multi-level
simulations including the coupling to phonons should be necessary to describe
the relaxation phenomenon in this type of qubit.

design a new multi-object tracker for the above issues that contains an object
\textbf{Relative Location Mapping} (RLM) model and \textbf{Target Region

posterior distributions for all unknowns in the underlying model. We apply the
new method, which we call WOMBAT v2.0, to a mix of satellite observations of
CO$_2$ mole fraction from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite

estimate the changes to CO$_2$ fluxes that occurred from January 2015 to
December 2020, and compare our posterior estimates to those from an alternative
method based on a bottom-up understanding of the physical processes involved.
We find substantial trends in the fluxes, including that tropical ecosystems
trended from being a net source to a net sink of CO$_2$ over the study period.
We also find that the amplitude of the global seasonal cycle of ecosystem
CO$_2$ fluxes increased over the study period by 0.11 PgC/month (an increase of
8%), and that the seasonal cycle of ecosystem CO$_2$ fluxes in the northern

a robust model for unseen tasks, which is a very difficult goal to achieve.
Further, learning transferable robust representations for unseen domains is a
difficult problem even with a large amount of data. To tackle such a challenge,
we propose a novel adversarial self-supervised meta-learning framework with
bilevel attacks which aims to learn robust representations that can generalize
across tasks and domains. Specifically, in the inner loop, we update the

different sets of augmented samples, and generate adversarial examples for each
view by maximizing the instance classification loss. Then, in the outer loop,
we meta-learn the encoder parameter to maximize the agreement between the two

experimentally validate the effectiveness of our approach on unseen domain

behaviour, typically in an unsupervised fashion, by assigning real-valued

from a Bayesian perspective, introducing a method for estimating the posterior

leverage on outputs of several anomaly detectors as a representation that

received tremendous interest in recent years due to the realization of exotic
electronic and magnetic phases. Here, we report the synthesis, structural,
magnetic, thermodynamic, and optical properties of the ternary iridate
Pr$_3$IrO$_7$. Single crystals of Pr$_3$IrO$_7$ have been grown by the KF flux
method. Structural analysis shows that Pr$_3$IrO$_7$ crystallizes in an
orthorhombic phase with $Cmcm$ symmetry. The electron energy loss spectroscopy
study indicates that Pr is in a 3+ valence state, which implies a 5+ oxidation
state of Ir. Magnetization data measured at high and low magnetic fields do not
exhibit any bifurcation between $M_{ZFC}$ and $M_{FC}$, however, a weak hump in
$M(T)$ is observed at $T^*$$\sim$10.4~K. The specific heat data reveal two
maxima at $\sim$253 K and $\sim$4.8 K. The optical conductivity
$\sigma_1(\omega)$ spectrum shows 24 infrared-active phonon modes and reveals
an insulating behavior with an optical gap $\Delta_{OP}$ of size $\sim$500~meV.
During cooling down, the temperature-dependent reflectivity spectrum reveals
eight extra phonon modes below the structural phase transition ($\sim$ 253 K).
An anomaly is observed at around $T^*$ in the temperature evolution of
infrared-active mode frequencies suggesting the presence of significant
spin-phonon coupling in the system.

predictions are limited to the components that are present in the original
dataset, and (ii) predictions towards the extreme values of the properties,
important regions for new materials discovery, are not very reliable due to the
sparse datapoints in this region. To address these challenges, here we present
a low complexity neural network (LCNN) that provides improved performance in
predicting the properties of oxide glasses. In addition, we combine the LCNN
with physical and chemical descriptors that allow the development of universal
models that can provide predictions for components beyond the training set. By
training on a large dataset (~50000) of glass components, we show the LCNN
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as XGBoost. In addition, we
interpret the LCNN models using Shapely additive explanations to gain insights
into the role played by the descriptors in governing the property. Finally, we
demonstrate the universality of the LCNN models by predicting the properties

widely employed at signalized intersections in numerous countries. Existing
optimization models rely on traditional delay models with specific assumptions
regarding vehicle arrivals. Recent advancements in intelligent mobility have
led to development of high-resolution trajectory data of connected vehicles
(CVs), thereby providing opportunities for improving fixed-time signal control.
Taking advantage of CV trajectories, this study proposes a cumulative flow
diagram (CFD)-based signal timing optimization method for fixed-time signal
control at isolated intersections, which includes a CFD model and a
multi-objective optimization model. The CFD model is formulated to profile the
time-dependent vehicle arrival and departure processes under varying signal
timing plans, where the intersection demand is estimated based on a weighted
maximum likelihood estimation method. Then, a CFD-based multi-objective
optimization model is proposed for both undersaturated and oversaturated
traffic conditions. The primary objective is to minimize the exceeded queue
dissipation time, whereas the secondary objective is to minimize the average
delay at the intersection. Considering the data-driven property of the CFD
model, a bi-level particle swarm optimization-based algorithm is then specially
designed to solve the optimal cycle length (and the reference point if it is
considered) and green ratios separately. The proposed method is evaluated based
on simulation data and compared with Synchro. The results indicate that the
proposed method outperforms Synchro under various traffic conditions in terms
of average delay and queue since the time-dependent vehicle arrivals during the
cycle are considered in a CV trajectory data-driven way.

spins in two-branched classical and quantum spin systems. We begin by studying
the classical Ising like spin models using Q2R and CCA dynamics and show that
just the difference in the number of spins is not enough and some other source
of asymmetry is required to observe heat current magnification. Unequal
spin--spin interaction strength in the upper and lower branch is employed as a
source of this asymmetry and it proves adequate for generating current
magnification in both the models. Suitable physical motivation is then provided
for current magnification in these systems, along with ways to control and
manipulate magnification through various system parameters. We also study a
five spin Quantum system with modified Heisenberg XXZ interaction and preserved
magnetisation using the Redfield master equation. We show that it is possible
to generate current magnification in this model by the asymmetry in the number
of spins only. Our results indicate that the onset of current magnification is
accompanied by a dip in the total current flowing through the system. On
analysis it is revealed that this dip might occur because of the intersection
of two non-degenerate energy levels for certain values of the asymmetry
parameter in the modified XXZ model. We deduce that the additional degeneracy
and the ergodic constraint due to fixed magnetisation in the system are the
main reasons for current magnification and other atypical behaviors observed.
We then use the concept of `ergotropy' to support these findings. Finally, for
both the classical and quantum models, we see that current magnification is
only observed when temperature gradient and intra-system interaction strength

informative model of the ground and the surface ahead is crucial for navigation
and obstacle avoidance. The ground surface is not always flat and it may be
sloped, bumpy and rough specially in off-road terrestrial scenes. In bumpy and
rough scenes the functional relationship of the surface-related features may
vary in different areas of the ground, as the structure of the ground surface
may vary suddenly and further the measured point cloud of the ground does not
bear smoothness. Thus, the ground-related features must be obtained based on
local estimates or even point estimates. To tackle this problem, the
segment-wise GP-based ground segmentation method with local smoothness
estimation is proposed. This method is an extension to our previous method in
which a realistic measurement of the length-scale values were provided for the
covariance kernel in each line-segment to give precise estimation of the ground
for sloped terrains. In this extension, the value of the length-scale is
estimated locally for each data point which makes it much more precise for the
rough scenes while being not computationally complex and more robust to
under-segmentation, sparsity and under-represent-ability. The segment-wise task
is performed to estimate a partial continuous model of the ground for each
radial range segment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed

  Intersections Based on Connected Vehicle Trajectories","30 pages, 11 figures",,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Accurate traffic demand estimation is critical for the dynamic evaluation and
optimization of signalized intersections. Existing studies based on connected
vehicle (CV) data are designed for a single phase only and have not
sufficiently studied the real-time traffic demand estimation for oversaturated
traffic conditions. Therefore, this study proposes a cycle-by-cycle multi-phase
traffic demand joint estimation method at signalized intersections based on CV
data that considers both undersaturated and oversaturated traffic conditions.
First, a joint weighted likelihood function of traffic demands for multiple
phases is derived given real-time observed CV trajectories, which considers the
initial queue and relaxes the first-in-first-out assumption by treating each
queued CV as an independent observation. Then, the sample size of the
historical CVs is used to derive a joint prior distribution of traffic demands.
Ultimately, a joint estimation method based on the maximum a posteriori (i.e.,
the JO-MAP method) is developed for cycle-based multi-phase traffic demand
estimation. The proposed method is evaluated using both simulation and
empirical data. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method can
produce reliable estimates under different penetration rates, arrival patterns,
and traffic demands. The feature of joint estimation makes our method less
demanding for the penetration rate of CVs and the consideration of prior
distribution can significantly improve the estimation accuracy. Empirical
results show that the proposed method achieves accurate cycle-based traffic
demand estimation with a MAPE of 12.73%, outperforming the other four methods.

Since many people

towards a specific view since search engine results are returned based on
relevance, which is calculated using many features and sophisticated algorithms
where search neutrality is not necessarily the focal point. Therefore, it is
important to evaluate the search engine results with respect to bias. In this
work we propose novel web search bias evaluation measures which take into
account the rank and relevance. We also propose a framework to evaluate web
search bias using the proposed measures and test our framework on two popular
search engines based on 57 controversial query topics such as abortion, medical
marijuana, and gay marriage. We measure the stance bias (in support or
against), as well as the ideological bias (conservative or liberal). We observe
that the stance does not necessarily correlate with the ideological leaning,
e.g. a positive stance on abortion indicates a liberal leaning but a positive
stance on Cuba embargo indicates a conservative leaning. Our experiments show
that neither of the search engines suffers from stance bias. However, both
search engines suffer from ideological bias, both favouring one ideological
leaning to the other, which is more significant from the perspective of
polarisation in our society.

the current state of the art for EV charging components. Under assumption of
bidirectional charging for EV, the corresponding flexibility polygon in the PQ
plane is derived. The impact on the FOR is then evaluated within the Cigr\'e
European medium voltage benchmark system. In a first step, the flexibility
potential of the system is determined for a load case as basis for the
comparison with different, realistic penetration levels of EV. DER are
considered to depict additional existing power flexibilities. In a second step,
the FOR and the corresponding limitations within the system are analyzed. Under
variation of the rated line current, the limiting utility constraints are
pointed out. The obtained results are the basis for more detailed
investigations regarding the potentials of bidirectional charging for an
intensified system operators cooperation. The used method presents a promising
approach to be used by the lower system operator as tool in the grid planning

the accumulation of EV leads to higher grid utilization, which results in
quadratically increasing grid losses the closer the grid is operating to the

  Our results show that, after a training phase, a messenger user can
distinguish different locations of the message receiver. Our analyses involving
multiple rounds of measurements and evaluations show that the timing side

PDEs on unknown manifolds, identified with randomly sampled point cloud data.
The PDE solver is formulated as a spectral method where the test function space
is the span of the leading eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator, which are
approximated from the point cloud data. While the framework is flexible for any
test functional space, we will consider the eigensolutions of a weighted
Laplacian obtained from a symmetric Radial Basis Function (RBF) method induced
by a weak approximation of a weighted Laplacian on an appropriate Hilbert
space. Especially, we consider a test function space that encodes the geometry
of the data yet does not require us to identify and use the sampling density of
the point cloud. To attain a more accurate approximation of the expansion
coefficients, we adopt a second-order tangent space estimation method to
improve the RBF interpolation accuracy in estimating the tangential
derivatives. This spectral framework allows us to efficiently solve the PDE
many times subjected to different parameters, which reduces the computational
cost in the related inverse problem applications. In a well-posed elliptic PDE
setting with randomly sampled point cloud data, we provide a theoretical
analysis to demonstrate the convergent of the proposed solver as the sample
size increases. We also report some numerical studies that show the convergence
of the spectral solver on simple manifolds and unknown, rough surfaces. Our
numerical results suggest that the proposed method is more accurate than a
graph Laplacian-based solver on smooth manifolds. On rough manifolds, these two
approaches are comparable. Due to the flexibility of the framework, we
empirically found improved accuracies in both smoothed and unsmoothed Stanford
bunny domains by blending the graph Laplacian eigensolutions and RBF

automatic driving, the calibration of the LiDAR and the camera has attracted
more and more attention. This calibration task is multi-modal, where the rich
color and texture information captured by the camera and the accurate
three-dimensional spatial information from the LiDAR is incredibly significant
for downstream tasks. Current research interests mainly focus on obtaining
accurate calibration results through information fusion. However, they seldom
analyze whether the calibrated results are correct or not, which could be of
significant importance in real-world applications. For example, in large-scale
production, the LiDARs and the cameras of each smart car have to get
well-calibrated as the car leaves the production line, while in the rest of the
car life period, the poses of the LiDARs and cameras should also get
continually supervised to ensure the security. To this end, this paper proposes
a self-checking algorithm to judge whether the extrinsic parameters are
well-calibrated by introducing a binary classification network based on the
fused information from the camera and the LiDAR. Moreover, since there is no
such dataset for the task in this work, we further generate a new dataset
branch from the KITTI dataset tailored for the task. Our experiments on the
proposed dataset branch demonstrate the performance of our method. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work to address the significance of
continually checking the calibrated extrinsic parameters for autonomous
driving. The code is open-sourced on the Github website at

that aimed at reducing households' financial burden resulting from a recent
price increase, especially in energy and mobility. These measures included
among others, a nation-wide public transport ticket for 9EUR per month and a
fuel tax cut that reduced fuel prices by more than 15%. In transportation
policy and travel behavior research this is an almost unprecedented behavioral
experiment. It allows to study not only behavioral responses in mode choice and
induced demand but also to assess the effectiveness of transport policy
instruments. We observe this natural experiment with a three-wave survey and an
app-based travel diary on a sample 2'263 individuals; for the Munich Study, 919
participants in the survey-and-app group and 425 in the survey-only group have
been successfully recruited, while 919 participants have been recruited through
a professional panel provider to obtain a representative nation-wide reference
group for the three-wave survey. In this fourth report we present the results
of the third wave. At the end of the study, all three surveys have been
completed by 1'484 participants and 642 participants completed all three
surveys and used the travel diary throughout the entire study. Based on our
results we conclude that when offering a 49EUR-Ticket as a successor to the
9~EUR-Ticket and a local travel pass for 30EUR/month more than 60% of all
9~EUR-Ticket owners would buy one of the two new travel passes. In other words,
a substantial increase in travel pass ownership in Germany can be expected,
with our modest estimate being around 20%. With the announcement of the
introduction of a successor ticket in 2023 as well as with the prevailing high
inflation, this study will continue into the year 2023 to monitor the impact on

measurement. There is a long history of methods designed to recover accurately
this phase from the phase ""wrapped"" inside $]-\pi,\pi]$. However, noise and
under-sampling limit the effectiveness of most techniques and require highly
sophisticated algorithms that can process imperfect measurements. Ultimately,
analysing successfully an interferogram amounts to pattern recognition, a task
where radial basis function neural networks truly excel at. The proposed neural
network is designed to unwrap the phase from two-dimensional interferograms,
where aliasing, stemming from under-resolved regions, and noise levels are
significant. The neural network can be trained in parallel and in three stages,
using gradient-based supervised learning. Parallelism allows to handle
relatively large data sets, but requires a supplemental step to synchronized
the fully unwrapped phase across the different networks.

sequences. Existing work falls into two categories: forecast models conditioned
on observed past motions, or generative models conditioned on action labels and
duration only. In contrast, we generate motion conditioned on observations of
arbitrary length, including none. To solve this generalized problem, we propose
PoseGPT, an auto-regressive transformer-based approach which internally
compresses human motion into quantized latent sequences. An auto-encoder first
maps human motion to latent index sequences in a discrete space, and
vice-versa. Inspired by the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT), we propose
to train a GPT-like model for next-index prediction in that space; this allows
PoseGPT to output distributions on possible futures, with or without
conditioning on past motion. The discrete and compressed nature of the latent
space allows the GPT-like model to focus on long-range signal, as it removes
low-level redundancy in the input signal. Predicting discrete indices also
alleviates the common pitfall of predicting averaged poses, a typical failure
case when regressing continuous values, as the average of discrete targets is
not a target itself. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach

GPT could also capture key aspects of language processing in the human mind and
brain. However, I will argue that these models are not suitable as neural
models of human language. Firstly, because they fail on fundamental boundary
conditions, such as the amount of learning they require. This would in fact
imply that the mechanisms of GPT and brain language processing are
fundamentally different. Secondly, because they do not possess the logistics of
access needed for compositional and productive human language processing.
Neural architectures could possess logistics of access based on small-world
like network structures, in which processing does not consist of symbol
manipulation but of controlling the flow of activation. In this view, two
complementary approaches would be needed to investigate the relation between
brain and cognition. Investigating learning methods could reveal how 'learned
cognition' as found in deep learning could develop in the brain. However,
neural architectures with logistics of access should also be developed to
account for 'productive cognition' as required for natural or artificial human
language processing. Later on, these approaches could perhaps be combined to
see how such architectures could develop by learning and development from a
simpler basis.

convenient for users to get information they are interested in. To deal with
billions of users and items, large-scale online recommendation services usually
consist of three stages: candidate generation, coarse-grained ranking, and
fine-grained ranking. The success of each stage depends on whether the model
accurately captures the interests of users, which are usually hidden in users'
behavior data. Previous research shows that users' interests are diverse, and
one vector is not sufficient to capture users' different preferences.
Therefore, many methods use multiple vectors to encode users' interests.
However, there are two unsolved problems: (1) The similarity of different
vectors in existing methods is too high, with too much redundant information.
Consequently, the interests of users are not fully represented. (2) Existing
methods model the long-term and short-term behaviors together, ignoring the
differences between them. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Multi-Interest
Co-Network (HCN) to capture users' diverse interests in the coarse-grained
ranking stage. Specifically, we design a hierarchical multi-interest extraction
layer to update users' diverse interest centers iteratively. The multiple
embedded vectors obtained in this way contain more information and represent
the interests of users better in various aspects. Furthermore, we develop a
Co-Interest Network to integrate users' long-term and short-term interests.
Experiments on several real-world datasets and one large-scale industrial
dataset show that HCN effectively outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. We
deploy HCN into a large-scale real world E-commerce system and achieve extra
2.5\% improvements on GMV (Gross Merchandise Value).

calculated via the Bethe-Heitler mechanism with final state interactions taken
into account. The deuteron bound state is described by a relativistic covariant
deuteron-nucleon vertex. With numerical results, we find that the differential
cross section has strong dependence on the lepton azimuthal angle in the small
polar angle region and sharp peaks appear in the dependence on the invariant
mass of the produced lepton pair or the two nucleons in the final state. We
demonstrate that such nearly singular feature originates from the collinearity
between the produced lepton or antilepton and the incident photon, and it is
physically regularized by the lepton mass in our calculation. The final state
interaction between the knocked-out nucleon and the recoil nucleon
redistributes the differential cross section over the missing momentum, with a
significant enhancement at large missing momentum and a suppression in the
intermediate region. With a further decomposition of the final state
interaction contribution, it is found that the on-shell term dominates the near
quasi-elastic region while the off-shell term dominates the other end. In
addition, we examine the contribution from the interference between the proton
amplitude and the neutron amplitude, which as expected is found negligible even
if the proton-neutron rescattering is included. The result in this work can
serve as an input for the analysis and background estimation of multiple

present a novel mixed-integer quadratic formulation for the OCT problem, which

analyse two alternative versions of MARGOT, which include feature selection
constraints inducing local sparsity of the hyperplanes. First, MARGOT has been
tested on non-linearly separable synthetic datasets in 2-dimensional feature
space to provide a graphical representation of the maximum margin approach.
Finally, the proposed models have been tested on benchmark datasets from the
UCI repository. The MARGOT formulation turns out to be easier to solve than
other OCT approaches, and the generated tree better generalizes on new
observations. The two interpretable versions are effective in selecting the
most relevant features and maintaining good prediction quality.

factors correlated to the predictive power of welfare in the reviewed studies
are the number of pre-processing steps employed, the number of datasets used,
the type of welfare indicator targeted, and the choice of AI model. As
expected, studies that used hard indicators as targets achieved better
performance in predicting welfare than those that targeted soft ones. Also
expected was the number of pre-processing steps and datasets used having a
positive and statistically significant relationship with welfare estimation
performance. Even more important, we find that the combination of ML and DL
significantly increases predictive power by as much as 15 percentage points
compared to using either alone. Surprisingly, we find that the spatial
resolution of the satellite imagery used is important but not critical to the
performance as the relationship is positive but not statistically significant.
The finding of no evidence indicating that predictive performance of a
statistically significant effect occurs over time was also unexpected. These
findings have important implications for future research in this domain. For
example, the level of effort and resources devoted to acquiring more expensive,
higher resolution SI will have to be reconsidered given that medium resolutions
ones seem to achieve similar results. The increasingly popular approach of
combining ML, DL, and TL, either in a concurrent or iterative manner, might
become a standard approach to achieving better results.

fix the multipolar structure of their exterior spacetime. However, in modified
gravity, or when the compact objects are not black holes, the exterior
spacetime may have a different multipolar structure. When two black holes are
in a binary, this multipolar structure determines the morphology of the
dynamics of orbital and spin precession. In turn, the precession dynamics
imprint onto the gravitational waves emitted by an inspiraling compact binary
through specific amplitude and phase modulations. The detection and
characterization of these amplitude and phase modulations can therefore lead to
improved constraints on fundamental physics with gravitational waves. Recently,
analytic precessing waveforms were calculated in two scenarios: (i) dynamical
Chern-Simons gravity, where the no-hair theorems are violated, and (ii)
deformed compact objects with generic mass quadrupole moments. In this work, we
use these two examples to propose an extension of the parameterized
post-Einsteinian~(ppE) framework to include precession effects. The new
framework contains $2n$ ppE parameters $(\mathscr{b}^{\rm ppE}_{(m',n)}, b^{\rm

$(\mathscr{a}^{\rm ppE}_{(m',n)}, a^{\rm ppE}_{(m',n)})$ for the waveform
amplitudes. The number of ppE corrections $n$ corresponds to the minimum number
of harmonics necessary to achieve a given likelihood threshold when comparing
the truncated ppE waveform with the exact one, and $(m',n)$ corresponds to the
harmonic numbers of the harmonics containing ppE parameters. We show explicitly
how these ppE parameters map to the specific example waveforms discussed above.
The proposed ppE framework can serve as a basis for future tests of general

require inhomogeneous node distributions. While spawning from a desire to
interpolate functions on a random set of nodes, they have found successful
applications in solving many types of differential equations. However, the
weights of the interpolated solution, used in the linear superposition of basis
functions to interpolate the solution, and the actual value of the solution are
completely different. In fact, these weights mix the value of the solution with
the geometrical location of the nodes used to discretize the equation. In this
paper, we used nodal radial basis functions, which are interpolants of the
impulse function at each node inside the domain. This transformation allows to
solve a linear hyperbolic partial differential equation using series expansion
rather than the explicit computation of a matrix inverse. This transformation
effectively yields an implicit solver which only requires the multiplication of
vectors with matrices. Because the solver requires neither matrix inverse nor
matrix-matrix products, this approach is numerically more stable and reduces
the error by at least two orders of magnitude, compared to other solvers using
radial basis functions directly. Further, boundary conditions are integrated
directly inside the solver, at no extra cost. The method is naturally
conservative, keeping the error virtually constant throughout the computation.

restriction operator. As is well-known, in general the weak bisimilarity is
coarser than the strong bisimilarity because it abstracts from internal
actions. In absence of restriction, those internal actions become somewhat
visible, so one might wonder if the weak bisimilarity is still 'weak'. We show
that in both CCScore (i.e., Milner's standard CCS without $\tau$-prefix,
summation and relabelling) and its higher-order variant (named HOCCScore), the
weak bisimilarity indeed remains weak, i.e., still strictly coarser than the
strong bisimilarity, even without the restriction operator. These results can
be extended to other first-order or higher-order process models. Essentially,
this is due to the direct or indirect existence of the replication operation,
which can keep a process retaining its state (i.e., capacity of interaction).
By virtue of these observations, we examine a variant of the weak bisimilarity,
called quasi-strong bisimilarity. This quasi-strong bisimilarity requires the
matching of internal actions to be conducted in the strong manner, as for the
strong bisimilarity, and the matching of visible actions to have no trailing
internal actions. We exhibit that in CCScore without the restriction operator,
the weak bisimilarity exactly collapses onto this quasi-strong bisimilarity,
which is moreover shown to coincide with the branching bisimilarity. These
results reveal that in absence of the restriction operation, some ingredient of
the weak bisimilarity indeed turns into strong, particularly the matching of

  Large gadolinium-doped water (Gd-H$_2$O) Cherenkov detectors are a developing
technology which use Gd loading to increase the visibility of the neutrons
produced in inverse beta decay (IBD) interactions, which produce
positron-neutron pairs coincident in time and space. In this paper, we describe
the reconstruction which uses the combined light from both events in an IBD
pair to accurately reconstruct the interaction vertex.
  The algorithm has been applied to the reconstruction of reactor antineutrinos
in Gd-H$_2$O and in Gd-doped water-based liquid scintillator (Gd-WbLS), an
advanced detector medium which is also currently in development.
  Compared to a single-event reconstruction, the combined reconstruction
improves vertex resolution for reactor IBD positrons by up to a factor of 4.5
at the lowest energies. IBD-neutron vertex resolution was found to improve by
more than 30% in most instances.
  Powerful background rejection with the coincidence reconstruction can be
achieved by requiring a minimum quality of fit. This was found to reject up to
94% of accidental coincidences of uncorrelated background events, while
retaining at least 97.5% of the IBD signal pairs.

conjunctive-induced dense subgraphs, where the subgraph edges need to have all

of research attention in recent years. Compared with static graphs, dynamic
graphs are the integrative reflection of both the temporal-invariant or stable

time. However, existing dynamic graph representation learning methods generally
confound these two types of information into a shared representation space,
which may lead to poor explanation, less robustness, and a limited ability when
applied to different downstream tasks. Taking the real dynamic graphs of daily
capital transactions on Tencent as an example, the learned representation of
the state-of-the-art method achieves only 32% accuracy in predicting
temporal-invariant characteristics of users like annual income. In this paper,
we introduce a novel temporal invariance-fluctuation disentangled

particular, we propose a temporal-invariant representation generator and a
dynamic-fluctuate representation generator with carefully designed pretext
tasks to identify the two types of representations in dynamic graphs. To
further enhance the disentanglement or separation, we propose a
disentanglement-aware discriminator under an adversarial learning framework.
Extensive experiments on Tencent and five commonly used public datasets

$N_{\mathrm{H}}$ as a function of Eddington fraction $\lambda_{\mathrm{Edd}} =
L_{\mathrm{bol}}/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$, where a lack of objects is seen in the
region where the effective limit is exceeded. Here, we conduct radiation
simulation using the CLOUDY code to deduce the radiative force applied onto
dusty gas at the nucleus and compare to the gravitational force to reveal the
outflow region and its boundary with long-lived absorption clouds. We also
investigate how the outflow condition is affected by various AGN and dust
properties and distribution. As expected, the dust abundance has the largest
effect on the $N_{\mathrm{H}} - \lambda_{\mathrm{Edd}}$ diagram since the
higher the abundance, the more effective the radiative feedback, while the
impact of the inner radius of the dusty gas shell, the shell width and the AGN
spectral shape are relatively negligible. The presence of other central masses,
such as a nuclear star cluster, can also make the feedback less effective. The
AGN spectral energy distribution depends on the mass of the black hole and its
spin. Though the effects of the AGN SED on the diagram are relatively small,
the fraction of ionizing ultraviolet (UV) photons from the blackbody accretion
disc is affected more by black hole mass than spin, and can influence the

of the most important catalysts in early cryptocurrency adoption. However, it
has become increasingly evident that AMMs in their current form are not viable
investment options for passive liquidity providers. This is because of the cost
incurred by AMMs providing stale prices to arbitrageurs against external market
prices, formalized as loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR) [Milionis et al., 2022].
  In this paper, we present Diamond, an automated market making protocol that
aligns the incentives of liquidity providers and block producers in the
protocol-level retention of LVR. In Diamond, block producers effectively
auction the right to capture any arbitrage that exists between the external
market price of a Diamond pool, and the price of the pool itself. The proceeds
of these auctions are shared by the Diamond pool and block producer in a way
that is proven to remain incentive compatible for the block producer. Given the
participation of competing arbitrageurs, LVR is effectively prevented in
Diamond.
  We formally prove this result, and detail an implementation of Diamond. We
also provide comparative simulations of Diamond to relevant benchmarks, further
evidencing the LVR-protection capabilities of Diamond.
  With this new protection, passive liquidity provision on blockchains becomes
rationally viable, beckoning a new age for decentralized finance.

an event sequence by performing inference on an automatically constructed event
graph and enhances generalisation ability through a neural event advisor. We
conduct a range of experiments on multiple criteria, and the results
demonstrate that our graph-based neural framework outperforms the

holographic single particle imaging methodology [Optica 7,593-601(2020)] to

Furthermore, we show that structural variations within the target particle are

heterogeneity in comparison to conventional SPI. With these computational
improvements, we believe reference-enhanced SPI is capable of reaching sub-nm

a weak nonlocality of optical Kerr nonlinearity can significantly change the
edge speed of DSWs and induces a singular behavior of the edge speed and hence
an instability of the DSWs. However, by increasing the degree of the Kerr
nonlocality, the singular behavior of the edge speed and the instability of the
DSWs can be suppressed. We also show that in a 3D Rydberg gas, DSWs can be
created and propagate stably when the system works in the intermediate
nonlocality regime. Due to the EIT effect and the giant nonlocal Kerr
nonlinearity contributed by the Rydberg-Rydberg interaction, DSWs found here
have extremely low generation power. In addition, an active control of DSWs can
be realized; in particular, they can be stored and retrieved with high
efficiency and fidelity through switching off and on a control laser field. The
results reported here are useful not only for unveiling intriguing physics of

presented significant achievements on large-scale labeled aerial laser point
cloud datasets. However, annotating such large-scaled point clouds is
time-consuming. Due to density variations and spatial heterogeneity of the
Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) point clouds, DNNs lack generalization capability
and thus lead to unpromising semantic segmentation, as the DNN trained in one
region underperform when directly utilized in other regions. However,
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a promising way to solve this problem by
pre-training a DNN model utilizing unlabeled samples followed by a fine-tuned
downstream task involving very limited labels. Hence, this work proposes a
hard-negative sample aware self-supervised contrastive learning method to
pre-train the model for semantic segmentation. The traditional contrastive
learning for point clouds selects the hardest negative samples by solely
relying on the distance between the embedded features derived from the learning
process, potentially evolving some negative samples from the same classes to
reduce the contrastive learning effectiveness. Therefore, we design an AbsPAN
(Absolute Positive And Negative samples) strategy based on k-means clustering
to filter the possible false-negative samples. Experiments on two typical ALS
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is more appealing than
supervised training schemes without pre-training. Especially when the labels
are severely inadequate (10% of the ISPRS training set), the results obtained
by the proposed HAVANA method still exceed 94% of the supervised paradigm
performance with full training set.

  Pruning",,"Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) October 2022",,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Subgraph similarity search, one of the core problems in graph search,
concerns whether a target graph approximately contains a query graph. The
problem is recently touched by neural methods. However, current neural methods
do not consider pruning the target graph, though pruning is critically
important in traditional calculations of subgraph similarities. One obstacle to
applying pruning in neural methods is {the discrete property of pruning}. In
this work, we convert graph pruning to a problem of node relabeling and then
relax it to a differentiable problem. Based on this idea, we further design a
novel neural network to approximate a type of subgraph distance: the subgraph
edit distance (SED). {In particular, we construct the pruning component using a
neural structure, and the entire model can be optimized end-to-end.} In the
design of the model, we propose an attention mechanism to leverage the
information about the query graph and guide the pruning of the target graph.
Moreover, we develop a multi-head pruning strategy such that the model can
better explore multiple ways of pruning the target graph. The proposed model
establishes new state-of-the-art results across seven benchmark datasets.
Extensive analysis of the model indicates that the proposed model can
reasonably prune the target graph for SED computation. The implementation of
our algorithm is released at our Github repo:

distributions using a combination of normalizing flows and elliptical slice
sampling (Murray et al., 2010). The central idea is to learn a diffeomorphism,
through normalizing flows, that maps the non-Gaussian structure of the target
distribution to an approximately Gaussian distribution. We then use the
elliptical slice sampler, an efficient and tuning-free Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) algorithm, to sample from the transformed distribution. The samples are
then pulled back using the inverse normalizing flow, yielding samples that
approximate the stationary target distribution of interest. Our transport
elliptical slice sampler (TESS) is optimized for modern computer architectures,
where its adaptation mechanism utilizes parallel cores to rapidly run multiple
Markov chains for a few iterations. Numerical demonstrations show that TESS
produces Monte Carlo samples from the target distribution with lower
autocorrelation compared to non-transformed samplers, and demonstrates
significant improvements in efficiency when compared to gradient-based
proposals designed for parallel computer architectures, given a flexible enough
diffeomorphism.

propagates in an environment dominated by stellar winds, we explain the
publicly available observations of afterglow associated with GRB 221009A over

energy (VHE) afterglow based on the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) process in
our model. We show the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis
results of GRB 221009A, and find that the SSC radiation component of GRB
221009A is very bright in the 0.1 - 10 TeV band. The integrated SED shows that
the SSC emission in the TeV band has significantly higher than the detection
sensitivity of LHASSO, MAGIC and CTA. However, since the release of further
observations, deviations from the standard wind environment model gradually
show up in data. For example, the late-time multiband afterglow cannot be
consistently explained under the standard wind environment scenario. It may be
necessary to consider modeling with a structured jet with complex geometry or a
partial revision of the standard model. Furthermore, we find that the inclusion

(BNS) mergers are progenitors of (at least some) short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs),
and that short GRB jets (and their afterglows) can have structures (and
observational properties) more complex than predicted by the standard top-hat
jet scenario. Indeed, the emission from the structured jet launched in GW170817
peaked in the radio band (cm wavelengths) at about 100 d since merger - a
timescale much longer than the typical time span of radio follow-up
observations of short GRBs. Moreover, radio searches for a potential late-time
radio flare from the fast tail of the neutron-rich debris that powered the
kilonova associated with GW170817 (AT2017gfo) have extended to even longer
timescales (years after the merger). In light of this, here we present the
results of an observational campaign targeting a sample of seven, years-old
GRBs in the Swift/BAT sample with no redshift measurements and no
promptly-identified X-ray counterpart. Our goal is to assess whether this
sample of short GRBs could harbor nearby BNS mergers, searching for the
late-time radio emission expected from their ejecta. We found one radio
candidate counterpart for one of the GRBs in our sample, GRB111126A, though an
origin related to emission from star formation or from an AGN in its host
galaxy cannot be excluded without further observations.

  Announcements",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Internet is a critical resource in the day-to-day life of billions of
users. To support the growing number of users and their increasing demands,
operators have to continuously scale their network footprint -- e.g., by
joining Internet Exchange Points -- and adopt relevant technologies -- such as
IPv6. IPv6, however, has a vastly larger address space compared to its
predecessor, which allows for new kinds of attacks on the Internet routing
infrastructure. In this paper, we revisit prefix de-aggregation attacks in the
light of these two changes and introduce Kirin -- an advanced BGP prefix
de-aggregation attack that sources millions of IPv6 routes and distributes them
via thousands of sessions across various IXPs to overflow the memory of border
routers within thousands of remote ASes. Kirin's highly distributed nature
allows it to bypass traditional route-flooding defense mechanisms, such as
per-session prefix limits or route flap damping. We analyze the theoretical
feasibility of the attack by formulating it as a Integer Linear Programming
problem, test for practical hurdles by deploying the infrastructure required to
perform a small-scale Kirin attack using 4 IXPs, and validate our assumptions
via BGP data analysis, real-world measurements, and router testbed experiments.
Despite its low deployment cost, we find Kirin capable of injecting lethal
amounts of IPv6 routes in the routers of thousands of ASes.

  bounds for bounded-treewidth graphs",,,,,"cs.CC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of this paper is to investigate a family of optimization problems
arising from list homomorphisms, and to understand what the best possible
algorithms are if we restrict the problem to bounded-treewidth graphs. For a
fixed $H$, the input of the optimization problem LHomVD($H$) is a graph $G$
with lists $L(v)$, and the task is to find a set $X$ of vertices having minimum
size such that $(G-X,L)$ has a list homomorphism to $H$. We define analogously
the edge-deletion variant LHomED($H$). This expressive family of problems
includes members that are essentially equivalent to fundamental problems such
as Vertex Cover, Max Cut, Odd Cycle Transversal, and Edge/Vertex Multiway Cut.
  For both variants, we first characterize those graphs $H$ that make the
problem polynomial-time solvable and show that the problem is NP-hard for every
other fixed $H$. Second, as our main result, we determine for every graph $H$
for which the problem is NP-hard, the smallest possible constant $c_H$ such
that the problem can be solved in time $c^t_H\cdot n^{O(1)}$ if a tree
decomposition of $G$ having width $t$ is given in the input, assuming the SETH.
Let $i(H)$ be the maximum size of a set of vertices in $H$ that have pairwise
incomparable neighborhoods. For the vertex-deletion variant LHomVD($H$), we
show that the smallest possible constant is $i(H)+1$ for every $H$.
  The situation is more complex for the edge-deletion version. For every $H$,
one can solve LHomED($H$) in time $i(H)^t\cdot n^{O(1)}$ if a tree
decomposition of width $t$ is given. However, the existence of a specific type
of decomposition of $H$ shows that there are graphs $H$ where LHomED($H$) can
be solved significantly more efficiently and the best possible constant can be
arbitrarily smaller than $i(H)$. Nevertheless, we determine this best possible
constant and (assuming the SETH) prove tight bounds for every fixed $H$.

discusses aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in BNNs and how they can be

tends to be lower in images which are well-represented in the training dataset

index) in composite materials by processing the signals of Lamb Waves -- a
non-destructive SHM technique -- with other meaningful features such as layup
parameters and stiffness matrices calculated from the Classical Laminate Theory

  The key advantages of our proposal are: (1) The automatic determination of
all the parameters involved in the prediction, so no hyperparameters have to be
set beforehand, which saves time devoted to hypertuning the model and also
represents an advantage for autonomous, self-supervised SHM. (2) No training is
required, which, in an \textit{online learning} context where streams of data

extending to the autonomous field, the development of autonomous driving
technology has continued to make breakthroughs. Thus, many carmakers and
high-tech giants dedicated to research and system development of autonomous
driving. However, as the foundation of autonomous driving, the deep learning
technology faces many new security risks. The academic community has proposed
deep learning countermeasures against the adversarial examples and AI backdoor,
and has introduced them into the autonomous driving field for verification.
Deep learning security matters to autonomous driving system security, and then
matters to personal safety, which is an issue that deserves attention and
research.This paper provides an summary of the concepts, developments and
recent research in deep learning security technologies in autonomous driving.
Firstly, we briefly introduce the deep learning framework and pipeline in the
autonomous driving system, which mainly include the deep learning technologies
and algorithms commonly used in this field. Moreover, we focus on the potential
security threats of the deep learning based autonomous driving system in each
functional layer in turn. We reviews the development of deep learning attack
technologies to autonomous driving, investigates the State-of-the-Art
algorithms, and reveals the potential risks. At last, we provides an outlook on
deep learning security in the autonomous driving field and proposes
recommendations for building a safe and trustworthy autonomous driving system.

disease detection is of critical importance for timely medical treatment to
save patients' lives. Routine use of electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most common
method for physicians to assess the electrical activities of the heart and
detect possible abnormal cardiac conditions. Fully utilizing the ECG data for
reliable heart disease detection depends on developing effective analytical

framework with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for automatic diagnosis of
ECG signals. The first-level model is composed of a Memory-Augmented Deep
auto-Encoder with GAN (MadeGAN), which aims to differentiate abnormal signals
from normal ECGs for anomaly detection. The second-level learning aims at
robust multi-class classification for different arrhythmias identification,
which is achieved by integrating the transfer learning technique to transfer
knowledge from the first-level learning with the multi-branching architecture
to handle the data-lacking and imbalanced data issue. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed framework using real-world medical data from the

manual analysis takes months to accumulate an appreciable sample of rings and
existing computational methods are vastly limited in terms of accuracy and
detection rate. Without a sizable sample of rings, further research into their
properties is severely restricted. This project investigates the usage of a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify rings from unclassified samples
of galaxies. A CNN was trained on a sample of 100,000 simulated galaxies,
transfer learned to a sample of real galaxies and applied to a previously
unclassified dataset to generate a catalog of rings which was then manually
verified. Data augmentation with a generative adversarial network (GAN) to
simulate images of galaxies was also used. A catalog of 1151 rings was
extracted with 7.4 times the precision and 15.4 times the detection rate of
conventional algorithms. The properties of these galaxies were then estimated
from their photometry and compared to the Galaxy Zoo 2 catalog of rings. With

interfaces is finding optimal stimulation patterns as a function of ongoing

goal-directed closed-loop neurostimulation, we propose ""neural co-processors""
which use artificial neural networks and deep learning to learn optimal
closed-loop stimulation policies, shaping neural activity and bridging injured
neural circuits for targeted repair and rehabilitation. The co-processor adapts
the stimulation policy as the biological circuit itself adapts to the
stimulation, achieving a form of brain-device co-adaptation. Here we use
simulations to lay the groundwork for future in vivo tests of neural
co-processors. We leverage a cortical model of grasping, to which we applied
various forms of simulated lesions, allowing us to develop the critical
learning algorithms and study adaptations to non-stationarity. Main results:
Our simulations show the ability of a neural co-processor to learn a
stimulation policy using a supervised learning approach, and to adapt that
policy as the underlying brain and sensors change. Our co-processor
successfully co-adapted with the simulated brain to accomplish the
reach-and-grasp task after a variety of lesions were applied, achieving
recovery towards healthy function. Significance: Our results provide the first
proof-of-concept demonstration of a co-processor for adaptive
activity-dependent closed-loop neurostimulation, optimizing for a
rehabilitation goal. While a gap remains between simulations and applications,
our results provide insights on how co-processors may be developed for learning
complex adaptive stimulation policies for a variety of neural rehabilitation

through consolidation remains an understudied area, despite being a prominent
feature of industries that produce complex made-to-order products. In this
paper, we propose an optimisation framework for exploiting multi-to-multi
relationship between tiers of a supply chain. The resulting formulation is
flexible such that quantity discounts, inventory holding and transport costs
can be included. The framework introduces a new trade-off between the tiers,
resulting in cost reductions at one tier at the expense of increased costs in
the other tier, which helps to reduce the overall procurement cost in the
supply chain. A mixed integer linear programming model is developed and tested
with a range of small to large-scale test problems from aerospace
manufacturing. Our comparison to benchmark results show that there is indeed a
cost trade-off between two tiers, and that its reduction can be achieved using
a holistic approach to reconfiguration. Costs are decreased when second tier
fixed ordering costs and the number of machining options increase.
Consolidation results in less inventory holding costs for all cases. A number
of secondary effects such as simplified supplier selection may also be
observed.

quantum advantages in the near term. In this thesis, we use the ZXW-calculus to
diagrammatically analyse two key problems that QML applications face.
  First, we discuss algorithms to compute gradients on quantum hardware that
are needed to perform gradient-based optimisation for QML. Concretely, we give
new diagrammatic proofs of the common 2- and 4-term parameter shift rules used

with $n!$ feasible feasible solutions. Given a fleet of $n$ airplanes with
mid-air refueling technique, each airplane has a specific fuel capacity and
fuel consumption rate. The fleet starts to fly together to a same target and
during the trip each airplane could instantaneously refuel to other airplanes
and then be dropped out. The question is how to find the best refueling policy
to make the last remaining airplane travels the farthest. To solve the large
scale of the airplane refueling problem in polynomial-time, we propose the
definition of the sequential feasible solution by employing the data structural
properties of the airplane refueling problem. We prove that if an airplane
refueling problem has feasible solutions, it must have sequential feasible
solutions, and its optimal feasible solution must be the optimal sequential
feasible solution. Then we present the sequential search algorithm which has a
computational complexity that depends on the number of sequential feasible
solutions referred to $Q_n$, which is proved to be upper bounded by $2^{n-2}$
as an exponential bound that lacks of applicability on larger input for worst
case. Therefore we investigate the complexity behavior of the sequential search
algorithm from dynamic perspective, and find out that $Q_n$ is bounded by
$\frac{m^2}{n}C_n^m$ when the input $n$ is greater than $2m$. Here $m$ is a
constant and $2m$ is regarded as the ""inflection point"" of the complexity of
the sequential search algorithm from exponential-time to polynomial-time.
Moreover, we build an efficient computability scheme according to which we
shall predict the specific complexity of the sequential search algorithm to
choose a proper algorithm considering the available running time for decision

In this paper, we propose RT-MOT, a novel system design for multiple MOT tasks,
which addresses R1 and R2. Focusing on multiple choices of a workload pair of
detection and association, which are two main components of the
tracking-by-detection approach for MOT, we tailor a measure of object
confidence for RT-MOT and develop how to estimate the measure for the next
frame of each MOT task. By utilizing the estimation, we make it possible to
predict tracking accuracy variation according to different workload pairs to be
applied to the next frame of an MOT task. Next, we develop a novel
confidence-aware real-time scheduling framework, which offers an offline timing
guarantee for a set of MOT tasks based on non-preemptive fixed-priority
scheduling with the smallest workload pair. At run-time, the framework checks
the feasibility of a priority-inversion associated with a larger workload pair,
which does not compromise the timing guarantee of every task, and then chooses
a feasible scenario that yields the largest tracking accuracy improvement based
on the proposed prediction. Our experiment results demonstrate that RT-MOT
significantly improves overall tracking accuracy by up to 1.5x, compared to
existing popular tracking-by-detection approaches, while guaranteeing timely
execution of all MOT tasks.

the relation between LAA morphology, the blood pattern and the triggering is

difficulties of acquiring appropriate data. On the other hand, in-silico

we systematically propose a novel dimension-augmented physics-informed neural

incorporating the expanded dimensionality in the loss function. Moreover, we
verify the effectiveness of power series augmentation, Fourier series

research in the field of image processing and pattern recognition. It has many
applications that include: a reading aid for visual impairment, automated
reading and processing for bank checks, making any handwritten document
searchable, and converting them into structural text form, etc. Moreover, high
accuracy rates have been recorded by handwriting recognition systems for
English, Chinese Arabic, Persian, and many other languages. Yet there is no
such system available for offline Kurdish handwriting recognition. In this
paper, an attempt is made to design and develop a model that can recognize
handwritten characters for Kurdish alphabets using deep learning techniques.
Kurdish (Sorani) contains 34 characters and mainly employs an Arabic\Persian
based script with modified alphabets. In this work, a Deep Convolutional Neural
Network model is employed that has shown exemplary performance in handwriting
recognition systems. Then, a comprehensive dataset was created for handwritten
Kurdish characters, which contains more than 40 thousand images. The created
dataset has been used for training the Deep Convolutional Neural Network model
for classification and recognition tasks. In the proposed system, the
experimental results show an acceptable recognition level. The testing results
reported a 96% accuracy rate, and training accuracy reported a 97% accuracy
rate. From the experimental results, it is clear that the proposed deep
learning model is performing well and is comparable to the similar model of
other languages' handwriting recognition systems.

suppress motion artifacts in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods
MC-Net was derived from a UNet combined with a two-stage multi-loss function.
T1-weighted axial brain images contaminated with synthetic motions were used to
train the network. Evaluation used simulated T1 and T2-weighted axial, coronal,
and sagittal images unseen during training, as well as T1-weighted images with
motion artifacts from real scans. Performance indices included the peak signal
to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and visual
reading scores. Two clinical readers scored the images. Results The MC-Net
outperformed other methods implemented in terms of PSNR and SSIM on the T1
axial test set. The MC-Net significantly improved the quality of all
T1-weighted images (for all directions and for simulated as well as real motion
artifacts), both on quantitative measures and visual scores. However, the
MC-Net performed poorly on images of untrained contrast (T2-weighted).
Conclusion The proposed two-stage multi-loss MC-Net can effectively suppress
motion artifacts in brain MRI without compromising image context. Given the
efficiency of the MC-Net (single image processing time ~40ms), it can
potentially be used in real clinical settings. To facilitate further research,

Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) for the text with its accompanying

only be understood in combination with visual information. However, there are
two drawbacks in existing approaches: 1) Meanings of the text and its
accompanying image do not match always, so the text information still plays a
major role. However, social media posts are usually shorter and more informal
compared with other normal contents, which easily causes incomplete semantic
description and the data sparsity problem. 2) Although the visual
representations of whole images or objects are already used, existing methods
ignore either fine-grained semantic correspondence between objects in images

objects in some images. In this work, we solve the above two problems by
introducing the multi-granularity cross-modality representation learning. To
resolve the first problem, we enhance the representation by semantic
augmentation for each word in text. As for the second issue, we perform the
cross-modality semantic interaction between text and vision at the different

Finally, based on a realworld dataset collected from field reports and logs of

performance of our keyword targeting strategy. Experimental results show that,
(a) BB-KSM outperforms seven baselines in terms of profit; (b) BB-KSM shows its

flight to connecting flights, leading to large disruptions in the overall
schedule. These disruptions cause massive economic losses, affect airlines'
reputations, waste passengers' time and money, and directly impact the
environment. This study adopts a network science approach for solving the delay
propagation problem by modeling and analyzing the flight schedules and
historical operational data of an airline. We aim to determine the most
disruptive airports, flights, flight-connections, and connection types in an
airline network. Disruptive elements are influential or critical entities in an
airline network. They are the elements that can either cause (airline
schedules) or have caused (historical data) the largest disturbances in the
network. An airline can improve its operations by avoiding delays caused by the
most disruptive elements. The proposed network science approach for disruptive
element analysis was validated using a case study of an operating airline. The
analysis indicates that potential disruptive elements in a schedule of an
airline are also actual disruptive elements in the historical data and they
should be considered to improve operations. The airline network exhibits
small-world effects and delays can propagate to any part of the network with a
minimum of four delayed flights. Finally, we observed that passenger
connections between flights are the most disruptive connection type. Therefore,
the proposed methodology provides a tool for airlines to build robust flight
schedules that reduce delays and propagation.

expand beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO), seeking to establish permanent presence on
the Moon and beyond. While space travel has traditionally been the domain of a
small number of highly specialized professionals, a new era of human
exploration, involving non-space actors and stakeholders, is now becoming a
reality. In spite of this development, most space habitats are still designed
for a narrow target group. This paper seeks to address this deficit by
rethinking the established design approaches, typically limited to tackling
engineering and challenges of human space exploration (such as radiation or
hypogravity), by instead adopting an interdisciplinary ""big picture""
perspective encompassing social, psychological and cultural aspects of future
space habitats. By elaborating and reflecting on our concept, this paper seeks
to demonstrate the importance of a trans-disciplinary approach to designing
thriving sustainable colonies beyond LEO. We demonstrate the potentially key
role of design as mediator in advancing macro-strategies promoting thriving
existence and sustainable growth. With this approach we tackle big-picture
questions about humanity's future and prospects amongst the stars.

Leshansky","Excess shear force exerted on oscillating plate due to a nearby particle","23 pages, 8 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the present paper we theoretically study the shear force exerted on an
infinite horizontal plane undergoing fast lateral oscillations in presence of a
rigid particle suspended in the viscous liquid above the plate. The study is
largely motivated by Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM-D) technique which relies
on analyzing response (complex impedance) of fast oscillating (in MHz range)
quartz crystal disk in the liquid medium due to small substances adsorbed at
its surface. In fact, small substances suspended in the liquid medium in the
vicinity of the oscillating crystal may also contribute to impedance, as they
modify the local shear force the suspending liquid exerts on the quartz
crystal. For a dilute suspension the contributions of individual particles are
additive and, therefore, our analysis is restricted to the excess shear force
due a single spherical particle located at arbitrary distance above the plane.
Three distinct cases are considered: (i) limiting case of high solid inertia,
whereas the heavy particle can be considered as stationary; (ii) a freely
suspended particle of arbitrary mass, undergoing fluid-mediated time-periodic
rotation and translation and (iii) an adsorbed particle moving with the plate
as a whole without rotation. For small-amplitude plane oscillations the
unsteady Stokes flow equations apply. We construct the series solution of these
equations using the method of reflections, whereas its terms are written
explicitly. Due to the exponential decay of the flow away from the oscillating
plate, the truncated series containing only few low-order terms shows an
excellent agreement with the rigorous numerical results for a wide range of
particle sizes and separation distances. The present results support the notion
that the hydrodynamic contribution of the suspended small substances to the
measured impedance is non-negligible or even dominant.
