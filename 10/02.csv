small change in malignant executable code can bypass these signature-based
detectors. Many machine learning-based models have been proposed to efficiently
detect a wide variety of malware. Many of these models are found to be
susceptible to adversarial attacks - attacks that work by generating
intentionally designed inputs that can force these models to misclassify. Our
work aims to explore vulnerabilities in the current state of the art malware
detectors to adversarial attacks. We train a Transformers-based malware
detector, carry out adversarial attacks resulting in a misclassification rate
of 23.9% and propose defenses that reduce this misclassification rate to half.

are characterized by 100~kyr glacial cycles overlain by fluctuations across a
wide range of time scales. We quantify this behavior through multifractal
time-weighted detrended fluctuation analysis, which distinguishes near
red-noise and white-noise behavior below and above the 100~kyr glacial cycle
respectively in all records. This allows us to model each time series as a
one-dimensional periodic non-autonomous stochastic dynamical system, and assess
the stability of physical processes and the fidelity of model-simulated time

influences, while carbon dioxide and temperature have smaller stabilizing
influences. We draw conclusions about causal relationships in glacial

  kernels",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Clustering based on the random walk operator has been proven effective for
undirected graphs, but its generalization to directed graphs (digraphs) is much
more challenging. Although the random walk operator is well-defined for
digraphs, in most cases such graphs are not strongly connected, and hence the
associated random walks are not irreducible, which is a crucial property for
clustering that exists naturally in the undirected setting. To remedy this, the
usual workaround is to either naively symmetrize the adjacency matrix or to
replace the natural random walk operator by the teleporting random walk
operator, but this can lead to the loss of valuable information carried by edge
directionality. In this paper, we introduce a new clustering framework, the
Parametrized Random Walk Diffusion Kernel Clustering (P-RWDKC), which is
suitable for handling both directed and undirected graphs. Our framework is
based on the diffusion geometry and the generalized spectral clustering
framework. Accordingly, we propose an algorithm that automatically reveals the
cluster structure at a given scale, by considering the random walk dynamics
associated with a parametrized kernel operator, and by estimating its critical
diffusion time. Experiments on $K$-NN graphs constructed from real-world
datasets and real-world graphs show that our clustering approach performs well
in all tested cases, and outperforms existing approaches in most of them.

segmentation hierarchy before recognition occurs. We are thus inspired to learn
image recognition with hierarchical image segmentation based entirely on
unlabeled images. Our insight is to learn fine-to-coarse features concurrently
at superpixels, segments, and full image levels, enforcing consistency and
goodness of feature induced segmentations while maximizing discrimination among
image instances.
  Our model innovates vision transformers on three aspects. 1) We use adaptive
segment tokens instead of fixed-shape patch tokens. 2) We create a token
hierarchy by inserting graph pooling between transformer blocks, naturally
producing consistent multi-scale segmentations while increasing the segment
size and reducing the number of tokens. 3) We produce hierarchical image
segmentation for free while training for recognition by maximizing image-wise
discrimination.
  Our work delivers the first concurrent recognition and hierarchical
segmentation model without any supervision. Validated on ImageNet and PASCAL
VOC, it achieves better recognition and segmentation with higher computational
efficiency.

core, producing core-collapse supernova (SN) explosions as the end products.
White dwarfs, formed through evolution of the less massive stars, also explode
as thermonuclear SNe if certain conditions are met during the binary evolution.
Inflating opportunities in transient observations now provide an abundance of
data, with which we start addressing various unresolved problems in stellar
evolution and SN explosion mechanisms. In this chapter, we overview the stellar
evolution channels toward SNe, explosion mechanisms of different types, and
explosive nucleosynthesis. We then summarize observational properties of SNe
through which the natures of the progenitors and explosion mechanisms can be
constrained.

energy-constrained robot in the presence of multiple charging stations. As the
robot's on-board power supply is limited, it might not have enough energy to
cover all the points in the environment with a single charge. Instead, it will
need to stop at one or more charging stations to recharge its battery
intermittently. The robot cannot violate the energy constraint, i.e., visit a
location with negative available energy. To solve this problem, we propose a
deep Q-learning framework that produces a policy to maximize the coverage and
minimize the budget violations. Our proposed framework also leverages the
memory of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to better suit this multi-objective
optimization problem. We have tested the presented framework within a 16 x 16
grid environment having charging stations and various obstacle configurations.
Results show that our proposed method finds feasible solutions and outperforms
a comparable existing technique.

Many existing methods achieve impressive performance on this issue by using
autoregressive text-generation models trained on code. However, these methods
are not without their flaws. The generated code from these models can be buggy,
lack documentation, and introduce vulnerabilities that may go unnoticed by
developers. An alternative to code generation -- neural code search -- is a
field of machine learning where a model takes natural language queries as input
and, in turn, relevant code samples from a database are returned. Due to the
nature of this pre-existing database, code samples can be documented, tested,
licensed, and checked for vulnerabilities before being used by developers in
production. In this work, we present CodeDSI, an end-to-end unified approach to

their respective code samples, which can be retrieved later. In an effort to
improve the performance of code search, we have investigated docid

adopting immersive technologies: Social Virtual Reality (VR). First, this
article provides a comprehensive review of studies having provided initial
evidence on (potential) benefits provided by Social VR in relevant use cases
related to education, such as online classes, training and co-design

Likewise, the potential benefits of integrating realistic and volumetric users'

we study the information paradox for the black hole patch by treating de-Sitter

membrane) and then we carry out similar study for de-Sitter patch also. In both
cases, when there is no island surface then the entanglement entropy has as
usual the linear time dependence whereas in the presence of an island surface
entanglement entropy become constant (equal to twice of thermal entropy of
black hole/de-Sitter patch). Therefore, we obtain the Page curves for the black
hole and de-Sitter patch consistent with the unitary evolution of black holes.
In our case, we have found that black hole island is located inside the black
hole event horizon in contrast to universal result for eternal black holes and
also cosmological island is located inside the cosmological event horizon.
Further, we have studied the ""effect of temperature"" on the Page curves and
found that Page curves appear at later times for low temperature black

This implies that ""dominance of islands"" and ""information recovery"" takes more

significantly scatter light, loosing transparency and thus impairing eyesight.
This condition, known as corneal edema, can be associated with different
causes, such as corneal scarring, corneal infection, corneal inflammation, and
others, making it difficult to diagnose and quantify. Previous works have shown
that Second Harmonic Generation Microscopy (SHG) represents a valuable
non-linear optical imaging tool to non-invasively identify and monitor changes
in the collagen architecture of the cornea, potentially playing a pivotal role
in future in-vivo cornea diagnostic methods. However, the interpretation of SHG
data can pose significant problems when transferring such approaches to
clinical settings, given the low availability of public data sets, and training
resources. In this work we explore the use of three Deep Learning models, the
highly popular InceptionV3 and ResNet50, alongside FLIMBA, a custom developed
architecture, requiring no pre-training, to automatically detect corneal edema
in SHG images of porcine cornea. We discuss and evaluate data augmentation
strategies tuned to the specifics of the herein addressed application and
observe that Deep Learning models building on different architectures provide
complementary results. Importantly, we observe that the combined use of such
complementary models boosts the overall classification performance in the case
of differentiating edematous and healthy corneal tissues, up to an AU-ROC=0.98.
These results have potential to be extrapolated to other diagnostics scenarios,
such as differentiation of corneal edema in different stages, automated
extraction of hydration level of cornea, or automated identification of corneal
edema causes, and thus pave the way for novel methods for cornea diagnostics
with Deep-Learning assisted non-linear optical imaging.

simulations using both the WKB approximation and the rigorous Lorenz-Mie

polystyrene beads using the main peak position and the phase value at this

measured with the scanning flow cytometer. In both cases, the spectral method
was consistent with the reference non-linear regression one. The former method
leads to comparable errors in retrieved particle characteristics but is 300
times faster than the latter one. The only drawback of the spectral method is a
limited operational range of particle characteristics that need to be set a

space `depth - angle - time' is considered. Due to the absence of multipath and
problems with caustics, the sound field distribution in phase space is less
sensitive to environmental disturbances and therefore more predictable than in
configuration space. The transition is carried out using the coherent state
expansion developed in the quantum theory. The found distribution of the field
intensity in the phase space agrees with the calculation performed with an

problems in the physical sciences, uncertainty quantification is becoming
correspondingly more important for their robust application. Uncertainty aware
machine learning methods have been used in select applications, but largely for
scalar properties. In this work, we showcase an exemplary study in which neural
network ensembles are used to predict the X-ray absorption spectra of small
molecules, as well as their point-wise uncertainty, from local atomic
environments. The performance of the resulting surrogate clearly demonstrates
quantitative correlation between errors relative to ground truth and the
predicted uncertainty estimates. Significantly, the model provides an upper
bound on the expected error. Specifically, an important quality of this
uncertainty-aware model is that it can indicate when the model is predicting on
out-of-sample data. This allows for its integration with large scale sampling
of structures together with active learning or other techniques for structure
refinement. Additionally, our models can be generalized to larger molecules
than those used for training, and also successfully track uncertainty due to
random distortions in test molecules. While we demonstrate this workflow on a
specific example, ensemble learning is completely general. We believe it could
have significant impact on ML-enabled forward modeling of a broad array of
molecular and materials properties.

suspension's viscosity with increasing applied shear rate. A key signature of
DST, highlighted in recent studies, is the very large fluctuations of the
measured stress as the suspension thickens. A clear link between
microstructural development and the dramatic increase of the stress
fluctuations has not been established yet. To identify the microstructural
underpinnings of this behavior, we perform simulations of sheared dense
suspensions. By analyzing particle contact networks, we identify a subset of
constrained particles that contribute directly to the rapid rise in viscosity
and the large stress fluctuations. Indeed, both phenomena can be explained by
the growth and percolation of constrained particle networks -- in direct
analogy to rigidity percolation. A finite size scaling analysis confirms this
is a percolation phenomenon and allows us to estimate the critical exponents.
Our findings reveal the specific microstructural transition that underlies DST.

algorithms face the so-called cold-start at the onset of the experiment due to
a lack of knowledge of customer preferences for new products, requiring an
initial data collection phase known as the burn-in period. During this period,
MAB algorithms operate like randomized experiments, incurring large burn-in
costs which scale with the large number of products. We attempt to reduce the
burn-in by identifying that many products can be cast into two-sided products,
and then naturally model the rewards of the products with a matrix, whose rows

obtain a substantially smaller targeted set of products and then apply a UCB

  Function Decomposition",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work analyzes the solution trajectory of gradient-based algorithms via a
novel basis function decomposition. We show that, although solution
trajectories of gradient-based algorithms may vary depending on the learning
task, they behave almost monotonically when projected onto an appropriate
orthonormal function basis. Such projection gives rise to a basis function
decomposition of the solution trajectory. Theoretically, we use our proposed
basis function decomposition to establish the convergence of gradient descent
(GD) on several representative learning tasks. In particular, we improve the
convergence of GD on symmetric matrix factorization and provide a completely
new convergence result for the orthogonal symmetric tensor decomposition.
Empirically, we illustrate the promise of our proposed framework on realistic
deep neural networks (DNNs) across different architectures, gradient-based
solvers, and datasets. Our key finding is that gradient-based algorithms
monotonically learn the coefficients of a particular orthonormal function basis
of DNNs defined as the eigenvectors of the conjugate kernel after training. Our

Rather than taking the domain to be the space of all linear maps we motivate
and define superchannels on the operator system spanned by quantum channels.
Extension theorems for completely positive maps allow us to apply the
characterisation theorem for superchannels to this smaller set of maps. These
extensions are non unique, showing two different superchannels act the same on
all input quantum channels, and so this new definition on the smaller domain
captures more precisely the action of superchannels as transformations between
quantum channels. The non uniqueness can affect the auxilliary dimension needed
for the characterisation as well as the tensor product of the superchannels.

turbulent model framework with emphasis on the nonlinear interactions between
large and small scale variables. The high computational cost in running large
ensemble simulations of high dimensional equations is effectively avoided by
adopting a random batch decomposition of the wide spectrum of the fluctuation
states which is a characteristic feature of the multiscale turbulent systems.
The time update of each ensemble sample is then only subject to a small portion
of the small-scale fluctuation modes in one batch, while the true model
dynamics with multiscale coupling is respected by frequent random resampling of
the batches at each time updating step. We investigate both theoretical and
numerical properties of the proposed method. First, the convergence of
statistical errors in the random batch model approximation is shown rigorously
independent of the sample size and full dimension of the system. Then, the
forecast skill of the computational algorithm is tested on two representative
models of turbulent flows exhibiting many key statistical phenomena with direct
link to realistic turbulent systems. The random batch method displays robust
performance in capturing a series of crucial statistical features of general
interests including highly non-Gaussian fat-tailed probability distributions
and intermittent bursts of instability, while requires a much lower
computational cost than the direct ensemble approach. The efficient random
batch method also facilitates the development of new strategies in uncertainty
quantification and data assimilation for a wide variety of complex turbulent
systems in science and engineering.

states and their properties are presented. Strongly related to lattice geometry
and material composition, there appear resonant bright channels and
non-resonant dark channels in the spectra. The bright state corresponds to high
reflectivity guided-mode resonance (GMR) whereas the dark channel represents a
bound state in the continuum (BIC). Even in simple systems, singular states
with tunable bandwidth appear as isolated spectral lines that are widely
separated from other resonance features. Under moderate lattice modulation,
there ensues leaky-band metamorphosis, merging modal bands and resulting in
offset dark states and reflective BICs along with transmissive BICs within a
high-reflectance wideband. Rytov-type effective medium theory (EMT) is shown to
be a powerful means to describe, formulate, and understand the collective
GMR/BIC fundamentals in resonant photonic systems. Particularly, the discarded
Rytov analytical solution for asymmetric fields is shown here to predict the
dark BIC states essentially exactly for considerable modulation levels. The
propagation constant of an equivalent EMT homogeneous film provides a
quantitative evaluation of the eminent, oft-cited embedded BIC eigenvalue. The

computing systems, represent a clear indication that the very notion of what a
physical computing device is and does should be recast in a rigorous and sound
framework. Physical computing has opened a whole stream of new research aimed
to understand and control how information is processed by several types of
physical devices. Therefore, classical definitions and entire frameworks need
to be adapted in order to fit a broader notion of what physical computing
systems really are. Recent studies have proposed a formalism that can be used
to carve out a more proper notion of physical computing. In this paper we
present a framework which capture such results in a very natural way via some
basic constructions in Category Theory. Furthermore, we show that, within our
framework, the compositional nature of physical computing systems is naturally
formalized, and that it can be organized in coherent structures by the means of
their relational nature.

multiple-output (MU-MIMO) uplink system in the finite blocklength regime. The
i.i.d. Gaussian codebook is assumed for each user. To be more specific, the BS
first uses two popular linear processing schemes to combine the signals
transmitted from all users, namely, MRC and ZF. Following it, the matched
maximum-likelihood (ML) and mismatched nearest-neighbour (NN) decoding metric
for the coherent and non-coherent cases are respectively employed at the BS.
Under these conditions, the refined third-order achievable coding rate,
expressed as a function of the blocklength, average error probability, and the
third-order term of the information density (called as the channel
perturbation), is derived. With this result in hand, a detailed performance
analysis is then pursued, through which, we derive the asymptotic results of
the channel perturbation, achievable coding rate, channel capacity, and the
channel dispersion. These theoretical results enable us to obtain a number of
interesting insights related to the impact of the finite blocklength: i) in our
system setting, massive MIMO helps to reduce the channel perturbation of the
achievable coding rate, which can even be discarded without affecting the
performance with just a small-to-moderate number of BS antennas and number of
blocks; ii) under the non-coherent case, even with massive MIMO, the channel
estimation errors cannot be eliminated unless the transmit powers in both the
channel estimation and data transmission phases for each user are made
inversely proportional to the square root of the number of BS antennas; iii) in
the non-coherent case and for fixed total blocklength, the scenarios with
longer coherence intervals and smaller number of blocks offer higher achievable
coding rate.

large scale association studies to increase power of detecting new variants.
Federated association testing among different institutions is a viable solution
for increasing sample sizes by sharing the intermediate testing statistics that
are aggregated by a central server. There are, however, standing challenges to
performing federated association testing. Association tests are known to be
confounded by numerous factors such as population stratification, which can be
especially important in multiancestral studies and in admixed populations among
different sites. Furthermore, disease etiology should be considered via
flexible models to avoid biases in the significance of the genetic effect. A
rising challenge for performing large scale association studies is the privacy
of participants and related ethical concerns of stigmatization and
marginalization. Here, we present dMEGA, a flexible and efficient method for
performing federated generalized linear mixed model based association testing
among multiple sites while underlying genotype and phenotype data are not
explicitly shared. dMEGA first utilizes a reference projection to estimate
population-based covariates without sharing genotype dataset among sites. Next,
dMEGA uses Laplacian approximation for the parameter likelihoods and decomposes
parameter estimation into efficient local-gradient updates among sites. We use
simulated and real datasets to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of
dMEGA. Overall, dMEGA's formulation is flexible to integrate fixed and random
effects in a federated setting.

subjected to a sequence of controlled operations and a final measurement.
Examples of XOR* games are $2\rightarrow 1$ quantum random access codes (QRAC)

prove, using the diagrammatic language of process theories, that under certain

that connects their optimal strategies, and so their classical (Bell) and
quantum (Tsirelson) bounds. One main assumption in the theorem is that the
sequential transformations in the XOR* games are reversible. However, this does
not affect the generality of the theorem in terms of assessing the maximum
quantum-over-classical advantage, since we also show that the use of

The predicted fraction of galaxies with bimodal GC metallicity distributions

show that, for massive galaxies ($M_\ast > 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$), bimodal GC
distributions primarily occur as a result of cluster disruption from
initially-unimodal distributions, rather than as a result of cluster formation
processes. Based on the distribution of field stars with GC-like abundances in

that two-layer transformers learn reliable solutions to multi-level problems,
develop signs of task decomposition, and encode input items in a way that

results provide key insights into how attention layers support structured

disrupting access of residents. Since flooding events are predicted to increase

understanding the flood-caused disruption of traffic networks is critical to
improve emergency planning and city resilience. Leveraging high-resolution
traffic network data from a major flood event and advanced high-order network
analysis, this study reveals characteristics of the anatomy of perturbed
traffic networks. First, the findings show network-wide persistent increased
travel times could last for weeks after flood water has receded, even after
modest flood failure. During disaster event period, modest flooding of 1.3%
road segments caused 8% temporal expansion of the entire traffic network. The
results also show distant trips would experience a greater percentage increase
in travel time. Also, the extent of increase in travel time does not decay with
distance from inundated areas, suggesting that the spatial reach of flood
impacts extends beyond flooded areas. Departing from the existing literature,
which primarily informs about physical vulnerability in road networks to
floods, the findings of this study provide important novel understanding of
floods impacts on the functioning of traffic networks in terms of travel time
and traffic network geometry. The persistent travel time increase in the entire
network can translate to significant social and economic impacts in terms of
user costs, additional CO2 emissions, and lost productivity. Due to the
importance of traffic networks functioning for the operation of cities, the
results have significance implications for city managers, transportation
planners, and emergency managers to deal with the impacts of urban flooding.

decrease with the increase of copper oxide content. The observed behavior is
discussed in terms of polymerization of the glass network, the degree of which
rises with concentration of Cu+ ions occupying Td sites in the glass matrix.
However, the samples containing low content of CuO are dominated by Cu2+ ions
that act as modifiers and induce structural imperfections by breaking of P-O-S

evolution of a temperature profile in a liquid-solid material and its moving
interface. This paper provides an observer-based event-triggered boundary
control strategy for the one-phase Stefan problem using the position and
velocity measurements of the moving interface. The infinite-dimensional
backstepping approach is used to design the underlying observer and controller.
For the event-triggered implementation of the continuous-time observer-based
controller, a dynamic event triggering condition is proposed. The triggering
condition determines the times at which the control input needs to be updated.
In between events, the control input is applied in a \textit{Zero-Order-Hold}
fashion. It is shown that the dwell-time between two triggering instances is
uniformly bounded below. Due to the existence of a minimal dwell-time, the
closed-loop system is free from the so-called \textit{Zeno behavior}. Under the
proposed event-triggered boundary control approach, the well-posedness of the
closed-loop system along with certain model validity conditions is proved.
Further, using Lyapunov approach, the global exponential convergence of the
closed-loop system to the setpoint is proved. A simulation example is provided
to illustrate the theoretical results.

high-dimensional data has been noticed as an important topic in machine
learning and data engineering. Using matrix factorization-based techniques such
as nonnegative matrix factorization for feature selection has emerged as a hot
topic in feature selection. The main goal of feature selection using matrix
factorization is to extract a subspace which approximates the original space
but in a lower dimension. In this study, rank revealing QR (RRQR)
factorization, which is computationally cheaper than singular value
decomposition (SVD), is leveraged in obtaining the most informative features as
a novel unsupervised feature selection technique. This technique uses the
permutation matrix of QR for feature selection which is a unique property to
this factorization method. Moreover, QR factorization is embedded into
non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) objective function as a new
unsupervised feature selection method. Lastly, a hybrid feature selection
algorithm is proposed by coupling RRQR, as a filter-based technique, and a
Genetic algorithm as a wrapper-based technique. In this method, redundant
features are removed using RRQR factorization and the most discriminative
subset of features are selected using the Genetic algorithm. The proposed
algorithm shows to be dependable and robust when compared against
state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms in supervised, unsupervised, and
semi-supervised settings. All methods are tested on seven available microarray
datasets using KNN, SVM and C4.5 classifiers. In terms of evaluation metrics,
the experimental results shows that the proposed method is comparable with the

calculate the inner product of the bounded variation function in the Hilbert

parameter $H\in (0,\frac12)$. This formula is based on a kind of decomposition
of the Lebesgue-Stieljes measure of the bounded variation function and the
integration by parts formula of the Lebesgue-Stieljes measure. Second, as an
application of the formula, we explore that as $T\to\infty$, the asymptotic
line for the square of the norm of the bivariate function
$f_T(t,s)=e^{-\theta|t-s|}1_{\{0\leq s,t\leq T\}}$ in the symmetric tensor

Berry-Ess\'{e}en type upper bound for the least squares estimation of the drift
coefficient of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with Hurst parameter
$H\in (\frac14,\frac12)$. The asymptotic analysis of the present paper is much
more subtle than that of Lemma 17 in Hu, Nualart, Zhou(2019) and the improved

Area Network continues to grow each year. As a result, the orchestration of so
many devices becomes a daunting, resource--consuming task, especially when the
resources available at the single access point are limited, and it is hard to
anticipate which devices will request access at any given time. On the other
hand, the number of antennas on both the devices and the access point grows as
well, facilitating advanced joint scheduling and coding techniques.
  In this paper, we leverage the large number of antennas and suggest a massive
multiple-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) scheme using sparse
coding based on Group Testing (GT) principles. The scheme allows for a small
subset of devices to transmit simultaneously, without a preceding scheduling
phase or coordination, thus reducing overhead and complexity.
  Specifically, we show that out of a population of \(N\) devices, it is
possible to jointly identify and decode \(K\) devices, unknown in advance,
simultaneously and without any scheduling. The scheme utilizes minimal
knowledge of channel state, uses an efficient (in both run-time and space)
decoding algorithm, and requires \(O(K\log N\mathcal{M})\) antennas, where
\(\mathcal{M}\) is the number of messages per device. In fact, we prove that
this scheme is order--optimal in the number of users and messages.
  This is done by deriving sufficient conditions for a vanishing error
probability (a direct result), bounding the minimal number of antennas
necessary for any such scheme (a converse result), and showing that these
results are asymptotically tight.

is characterised by a chain of mean motion resonances, called Laplace
resonance, and by a strong tidal dissipation that causes wide variations of
their semi-major axes over large timescales. The precise history of energy
dissipation in the Jovian system is not known, but several theories have been
proposed. Tidal resonance locking states that big outer moons can also migrate
fast. If this is the case for Callisto, then it should have crossed the 2:1
mean motion resonance with Ganymede in the past, affecting the motion of all
four Galilean satellites. Therefore, we aim to determine whether a fast
migration for Callisto is compatible with the current orbital configuration of
the system. Due to the chaotic nature of the resonant crossing, different
outcomes are possible. A small portion of our simulations shows that Callisto
can cross the 2:1 resonance with Ganymede without being captured and preserving
the Laplace resonance. However, in most cases, we found that Callisto is
captured into resonance, despite its divergent migration. As Callisto continues
to migrate fast outwards, the moons depart substantially from the exact 8:4:2:1
commensurability, while still maintaining the resonant chain. Callisto can
eventually escape it by crossing a high-order mean motion resonance with
Ganymede. Afterwards, the moons' system is able to relax to its current
configuration for suitable dissipation parameters of the satellites. Therefore
it is possible, although challenging, to build a self-consistent picture of the
past history of the Galilean satellites for a fast migration of Callisto.

that under the influence of the self-steepening effect, a finite-volume rogue

Raman-induced self-frequency shift, a decelerating rogue wave generates a
red-shifted Raman radiation while the rogue wave itself turns into a

approaching large-scale graph machine learning problems. Given a large graph,
graph coarsening aims to learn a smaller-tractable graph while preserving the
properties of the originally given graph. Graph data consist of node features

methods ignore the node features and rely solely on a graph matrix to simplify
graphs. In this paper, we introduce a novel optimization-based framework for
graph dimensionality reduction. The proposed framework lies in the unification
of graph learning and dimensionality reduction. It takes both the graph matrix

coarsen feature matrix jointly while ensuring desired properties. The proposed
optimization formulation is a multi-block non-convex optimization problem,
which is solved efficiently by leveraging block majorization-minimization,
$\log$ determinant, Dirichlet energy, and regularization frameworks. The
proposed algorithms are provably convergent and practically amenable to
numerous tasks. It is also established that the learned coarsened graph is

often inferred from the spectrum of periodic Schr\""odinger operators. As a
consequence of Bloch's theorem, the numerical computation of electronic
quantities of interest involves computing derivatives or integrals over the
Brillouin zone of so-called energy bands, which are piecewise smooth, Lipschitz
continuous periodic functions obtained by solving a parametrized elliptic
eigenvalue problem on a Hilbert space of periodic functions. Classical
discretization strategies for resolving these eigenvalue problems produce
approximate energy bands that are either non-periodic or discontinuous, both of
which cause difficulty when computing numerical derivatives or employing
numerical quadrature. In this article, we study an alternative discretization
strategy based on an ad hoc operator modification approach. While specific
instances of this approach have been proposed in the physics literature, we
introduce here a systematic formulation of this operator modification approach.
We derive a priori error estimates for the resulting energy bands and we show
that these bands are periodic and can be made arbitrarily smooth (away from
band crossings) by adjusting suitable parameters in the operator modification
approach. Numerical experiments involving a toy model in 1D, graphene in 2D,

multiple-output (MIMO) systems has been recognized as a crucial task in
machine-type communications, in which multiple access points (APs) jointly
identify the active devices from a large number of potential devices based on
the received signals. Most of the existing works addressing this problem rely
on the impractical assumption that different active devices transmit signals
synchronously. However, in practice, synchronization cannot be guaranteed due
to the low-cost oscillators, which brings additional discontinuous and
nonconvex constraints to the detection problem. To address this challenge, this
paper reveals an equivalent reformulation to the asynchronous activity
detection problem, which facilitates the development of a centralized algorithm
and a distributed algorithm that satisfy the highly nonconvex constraints in a
gentle fashion as the iteration number increases, so that the sequence
generated by the proposed algorithms can get around bad stationary points. To
reduce the capacity requirements of the fronthauls, we further design a
communication-efficient accelerated distributed algorithm. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed centralized and distributed algorithms outperform
state-of-the-art approaches, and the proposed accelerated distributed algorithm
achieves a close detection performance to that of the centralized algorithm but
with a much smaller number of bits to be transmitted on the fronthaul links.

system. Probabilistic Graphical Models comprising Bayesian and Markov networks,
and Conditional Independence graphs are some of the popular graph
representation techniques. They can model relationships between features
(nodes) together with the underlying distribution. Although theoretically these
models can represent very complex dependency functions, in practice often
simplifying assumptions are made due to computational limitations associated
with graph operations. This work introduces Neural Graphical Models (NGMs)
which attempt to represent complex feature dependencies with reasonable
computational costs. Specifically, given a graph of feature relationships and
corresponding samples, we capture the dependency structure between the features
along with their complex function representations by using neural networks as a
multi-task learning framework. We provide efficient learning, inference and
sampling algorithms for NGMs. Moreover, NGMs can fit generic graph structures
including directed, undirected and mixed-edge graphs as well as support mixed
input data types. We present empirical studies that show NGMs' capability to
represent Gaussian graphical models, inference analysis of a lung cancer data
and extract insights from a real world infant mortality data provided by CDC.

nonlinear problems, machine learning is replacing traditional methods and
becoming a better approach for eigenvalue and wave function solutions of
multi-dimensional Schr\""{o}dinger equations. This paper proposes a numerical
method based on neural networks to solve multiple excited states of
multi-dimensional stationary Schr\""{o}dinger equation. We introduce the
orthogonal normalization condition into the loss function, use the frequency
principle of neural networks to automatically obtain multiple excited state
eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the equation from low to high energy levels,
and propose a degenerate level processing method. The use of equation residuals
and energy uncertainty makes the error of each energy level converge to 0,
which effectively avoids the order of magnitude interference of error
convergence, improves the accuracy of wave functions, and improves the accuracy
of eigenvalues as well. Comparing our results to the previous work, the
accuracy of the harmonic oscillator problem is at least an order of magnitude
higher with fewer training epochs. We complete numerical experiments on typical
analytically solvable Schr\""{o}dinger equations, e.g., harmonic oscillators and
hydrogen-like atoms, and propose calculation and evaluation methods for each
physical quantity, which prove the effectiveness of our method on eigenvalue
problems. Our successful solution of the excited states of the hydrogen atom

It is based on the solution of the 1D inviscid Burger's equation. This
reduced-physics approach produces solar wind flow simulations that closely
emulate the flow produced by 3-D magnetohydrodynamic solar wind models at a
small fraction of the computational expense. While not intended as a
replacement for 3-D MHD, the simplicity and computational efficiency of HUXt
offers several key advantages that enable experiments and the use of techniques
that would otherwise be cost prohibitive. For example, large ensembles can
easily be run with modest computing resources, which are useful for exploring
and quantifying the uncertainty in space weather predictions, as well as for
the application of some data assimilation methods.
  We present the developments in the latest version of HUXt, v4.0, and discuss
our plans for future developments and applications of the model. The three key
developments in v4.0 are: a restructuring of the models solver to enable fully
time-dependent boundary conditions, such that HUXt can in principle be
initialised with in-situ observations from any of the fleet of heliospheric
monitors; new functionality to trace streaklines through the HUXt flow
solutions, which can be used to track features such as the Heliospheric Current
Sheet; introduction of a small test-suite so that we can better ensure the
reliability and reproducibility of HUXt simulations for all users across future
versions. Other more minor developments are discussed in the article.
  Future applications of HUXt are discussed, including the development data
assimilation schemes for assimilation of both remote sensing and in-situ plasma
measures. We discuss the progress of transitioning HUXt into an operational
model at the UK's Met Office Space Weather Operations Center as part of the UK

$V$ the first example of a finitely generated group, in fact the first example

dissipative term in the GCM Hamiltonian that determines the time evolution of a

the integrated flux of the probability current through the scission

One of the most important criteria for higher survival rates is the early and

the current state of the art due to their spatial and temporal resolution, high
sensitivity and selectivity, ease of modification towards generating
activatable agents, ease of operation, and low cost. In addition to imaging,
light-based treatment modality, photodynamic therapy (PDT), attained remarkable
attention, as it is minimally invasive and has fewer side effects compared to
the current standard of care treatments. Even though fluorescence imaging and
PDT have these significant advantages, light that needs to excite the agent has
limited penetration in tissues, hindering widespread utilization. Hybrid
xanthene dyes, particularly ones bearing silicon or phosphine oxide as the
bridging unit of xanthene moiety, gained significant interest not only due to
their excellent photochemical properties in aqueous media, high fluorescence
quantum yield, photostability but also their proper absorption and emission
maxima that allow for deep tissue imaging and therapy. Here, the design and
synthesis strategies, key photophysical properties, their application in
fluorescence imaging applications, and surprisingly limited utilization as PDT
agents of hybrid xanthene dyes that emerged in the last decade have been

the Stein Fisher information, depends on $\rho_0$ and $\pi$ very weakly. This
is very different from the kernelized gradient flow of Kullback-Leibler

$D_{KL}\left(\rho_0\mid\pi\right)$. Under certain assumptions, we provide a

features, and only one party holds the labels. While VFL shows good
performance, practitioners often face uncertainty when preparing
non-transparent, internal/external features and samples for the VFL training
phase. Moreover, to balance the prediction accuracy and the resource
consumption of model inference, practitioners require to know which subset of
prediction instances is genuinely needed to invoke the VFL model for inference.
To this end, we co-design the VFL modeling process by proposing an interactive
real-time visualization system, VFLens, to help practitioners with feature
engineering, sample selection, and inference. A usage scenario, a quantitative
experiment, and expert feedback suggest that VFLens helps practitioners boost
VFL efficiency at a lower cost with sufficient confidence.

utilized dislocations as ``probes'' for the local energy maxima which play the
role of pinning points for the dislocation movement. To this end, we developed
a unique data-mining approach that can perform coarse-grained spatio-temporal

ability to recognize or generate novel combinations of observed elementary
concepts. In hopes of enabling compositional generalization, various
unsupervised learning algorithms have been proposed with inductive biases that
aim to induce compositional structure in learned representations (e.g.
disentangled representation and emergent language learning). In this work, we
evaluate these unsupervised learning algorithms in terms of how well they
enable compositional generalization. Specifically, our evaluation protocol
focuses on whether or not it is easy to train a simple model on top of the
learned representation that generalizes to new combinations of compositional
factors. We systematically study three unsupervised representation learning
algorithms - $\beta$-VAE, $\beta$-TCVAE, and emergent language (EL)
autoencoders - on two datasets that allow directly testing compositional
generalization. We find that directly using the bottleneck representation with
simple models and few labels may lead to worse generalization than using
representations from layers before or after the learned representation itself.
In addition, we find that the previously proposed metrics for evaluating the
levels of compositionality are not correlated with actual compositional
generalization in our framework. Surprisingly, we find that increasing pressure
to produce a disentangled representation produces representations with worse
generalization, while representations from EL models show strong compositional
generalization. Taken together, our results shed new light on the compositional
generalization behavior of different unsupervised learning algorithms with a
new setting to rigorously test this behavior, and suggest the potential
benefits of delevoping EL learning algorithms for more generalizable
representations.

lattices of different types depending on the asphericity parameter of the

perform long-distance delivery tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal logistics framework, in which the UAVs can call on ground vehicles
to provide hitch services to save their own energy and extend their delivery
distance. This multimodal logistics framework is formulated as a two-stage
model to jointly consider the incentive mechanism design for ground vehicles
and path planning for UAVs. In Stage I, to deal with the motivations for ground
vehicles to assist UAV delivery, a dynamic pricing scheme is proposed to best
balance the vehicle response time and payments to ground vehicles. It shows
that a higher price should be decided if the vehicle response time is long to
encourage more vehicles to offer a ride. In Stage II, the task allocation and
path planning of the UAVs over traffic network is studied based on the vehicle
response time obtained in Stage I. To address pathfinding with restrictions and
the performance degradation of the pathfinding algorithm due to the rising
number of conflicts in multi-agent pathfinding, we propose the suboptimal
conflict avoidance-based path search (CABPS) algorithm, which has polynomial
time complexity. Finally, we validate our results via simulations. It is shown
that our approach is able to increase the success rate of UAV package delivery.
Moreover, we estimate the delivery time of the UAV in a pessimistic case, it is

In this paper, we compare different scenario tree structures. In particular, we
enrich a two-stage formulation by introducing a piecewise linear approximation
of the value of the terminal inventory, to mitigate the two-stage myopic
behavior. We compare the out-of-sample performance of the resulting models by
rolling horizon simulations, within a data-driven setting, characterized by

also develop the machinery needed to study it rigorously. The proposal comes
with some advantages. It preserves gauge invariance manifestly, avoids
introducing unphysical fields, such as ghosts and Pauli-Villars fields, and
does not require gauge-fixing. However, we show that in the simple case of
SU(N) Yang-Mills it does not completely regularise the longitudinal part of
vertex functions already at one loop, invalidating certain methods for
extracting universal components. Moreover we demonstrate a kind of no-go
theorem: within the proposed structure, whatever choice is made for
covariantisation and cutoff profiles, the two-point vertex flow equation at one
loop cannot be both transverse, as required by gauge invariance, and fully
regularised.

  Biology",,"10.1088/1361-6560/acc9a1",,"eess.IV eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective. Imaging dynamic object with high temporal resolution is
challenging in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Partial separable (PS) model
was proposed to improve the imaging quality by reducing the degrees of freedom
of the inverse problem. However, PS model still suffers from long acquisition
time and even longer reconstruction time. The main objective of this study is
to accelerate the PS model, shorten the time required for acquisition and
reconstruction, and maintain good image quality simultaneously. Approach. We
proposed to fully exploit the dimension reduction property of the PS model,
which means implementing the optimization algorithm in subspace. We optimized
the data consistency term, and used a Tikhonov regularization term based on the
Frobenius norm of temporal difference. The proposed dimension-reduced
optimization technique was validated in free-running cardiac MRI. We have
performed both retrospective experiments on public dataset and prospective
experiments on in-vivo data. The proposed method was compared with four
competing algorithms based on PS model, and two non-PS model methods. Main
results. The proposed method has robust performance against shortened
acquisition time or suboptimal hyper-parameter settings, and achieves superior
image quality over all other competing algorithms. The proposed method is
20-fold faster than the widely accepted PS+Sparse method, enabling image
reconstruction to be finished in just a few seconds. Significance. Accelerated
PS model has the potential to save much time for clinical dynamic MRI
examination, and is promising for real-time MRI applications.

useful behaviors in a task-agnostic environment without the guidance of

tasks. Previous works focused on the pre-training in a model-free manner while
lacking the study of transition dynamics modeling that leaves a large space for
the improvement of sample efficiency in downstream tasks. To this end, we
propose an Efficient Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Framework with
Multi-choice Dynamics model (EUCLID), which introduces a novel model-fused
paradigm to jointly pre-train the dynamics model and unsupervised exploration
policy in the pre-training phase, thus better leveraging the environmental
samples and improving the downstream task sampling efficiency. However,
constructing a generalizable model which captures the local dynamics under
different behaviors remains a challenging problem. We introduce the
multi-choice dynamics model that covers different local dynamics under
different behaviors concurrently, which uses different heads to learn the state
transition under different behaviors during unsupervised pre-training and
selects the most appropriate head for prediction in the downstream task.
Experimental results in the manipulation and locomotion domains demonstrate
that EUCLID achieves state-of-the-art performance with high sample efficiency,
basically solving the state-based URLB benchmark and reaching a mean normalized
score of 104.0$\pm$1.2$\%$ in downstream tasks with 100k fine-tuning steps,

Cognitive multilayer networks can map multiple types of information at once,

gentle introduction to the structure and formalism of multilayer networks. We
then discuss quantitative mechanisms of psychological phenomena that could not

multiple layers of the lexicon: (i) multiplex viability highlights language
kernels and facilitative effects of knowledge processing in healthy and

analysis can mediate latent interactions of mediation, suppression and

but it remains difficult due to a lack of sufficient training data in
combination with a large variability of writing styles and degradation of
historical documents. While recurrent neural network architectures are commonly
used for handwritten text recognition, they are often computationally expensive
to train and the benefit of recurrence drastically differs by task. For these
reasons, it is important to consider non-recurrent architectures. In the
context of handwritten date recognition, we propose an architecture based on
the EfficientNetV2 class of models that is fast to train, robust to parameter
choices, and accurately transcribes handwritten dates from a number of sources.
For training, we introduce a database containing almost 10 million tokens,
originating from more than 2.2 million handwritten dates which are segmented
from different historical documents. As dates are some of the most common
information on historical documents, and with historical archives containing
millions of such documents, the efficient and automatic transcription of dates
has the potential to lead to significant cost-savings over manual
transcription. We show that training on handwritten text with high variability
in writing styles result in robust models for general handwritten text
recognition and that transfer learning from the DARE system increases
transcription accuracy substantially, allowing one to obtain high accuracy even
when using a relatively small training sample.

detection of the gravitational waves in space, the spot size of a flat top beam
generated by the clipping of the Gaussian beam (GB) is studied. By adopting the
mode expansion method (MEM) approach to simulating the beam, a slight variant
of the definition of the mean square deviation (MSD) spot size for the MEM beam
is proposed. This enables us to quickly estimate the spot size for arbitrary
propagation distances. Given that the degree of clipping is dependent on the
power ratio within the surface of an optical element, the power ratio within
the MSD spot range is used as a measure of spot size. The definition is then
validated in the cases of simple astigmatic Gaussian beam and nearly-Gaussian
beam profiles. As a representative example, the MSD spot size for a top-hat
beam in a science interferometer in the detection of gravitational waves in
space is then simulated. As in traditional MSD spot size analysis, the spot
size is divergent when diffraction is taken into account. A careful error
analysis is carried out on the divergence and in the present context, it is
argued that this error will have little effect on our estimation. Using the
results of our study allows an optimal design of optical systems with top-hat
or other types of non-Gaussian beams. Furthermore, it allows testing the
interferometry of space-based gravitational wave detectors for beam clipping in
optical simulations. The present work will serve as a useful guide in the

sparsity of point clouds makes it difficult to compute the similarity and
locate the object, posing big challenges to the 3D tracker. Previous works
tried to solve the problem and improved the tracking performance in some common
scenarios, but they usually failed in some extreme sparse scenarios, such as
for tracking objects at long distances or partially occluded. To address the
above problems, in this letter, we propose a sparse-to-dense and
transformer-based framework for 3D single object tracking. First, we transform
the 3D sparse points into 3D pillars and then compress them into 2D BEV
features to have a dense representation. Then, we propose an attention-based
encoder to achieve global similarity computation between template and search
branches, which could alleviate the influence of sparsity. Meanwhile, the
encoder applies the attention on multi-scale features to compensate for the
lack of information caused by the sparsity of point cloud and the single scale
of features. Finally, we use set-prediction to track the object through a
two-stage decoder which also utilizes attention. Extensive experiments show
that our method achieves very promising results on the KITTI and NuScenes
datasets.

covariate shift and label gap. We use histogram loss instead of mean squared or

samples for adversarial entropy optimization. In experimental evaluations, the

the effect of the soliton profile on the thin-accretion disk. Soliton dark
matter effects manifest through the varying luminosity near the event horizon.
We also analyzed the weak deflection angle and the produced Einstein rings due

size deviation, for the light source near the SMBH with impact parameters

injection velocity at the mouth is not uni-directional. Instead, the droplets
are injected into various directions, with their trajectories forming a cone
shape in space. Furthermore, we find that the period of droplet emissions is
much shorter than that of the cough: experimental results indicate that the
droplets with an initial diameter $\gtrsim 10\mu$m are emitted within the first
0.05 s, whereas the cough duration is closer to 1 s. These two features (the
spread in the direction of injection velocity and the short duration of droplet

design a two-stage pipeline framework, which includes the privacy-preserving
feature encoder and the heterogeneous link reconstructor with gradients
perturbation based on differential privacy to tolerate data diversity and
against the attack. To better control the noise and promote model performance,
we utilize a bi-level optimization pattern to allocate a suitable privacy
budget for the above two modules. Our experiments on four public benchmarks
show that the HeteDP method is equipped to resist heterogeneous graph privacy
leakage with admirable model generalization.

improve performance while decreasing the cognitive burden, especially when
using advanced systems with multiple functions. However, a drawback of this
approach is that it relies on the complex processing of a significant amount of
data (e.g., a point cloud provided by a depth sensor), which can be a challenge
when deploying such a system onto an embedded prosthesis controller. In the
present study, therefore, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the shape of
the target object using minimal data. Specifically, four concurrent laser
scanner lines provide partial contours of the object cross-section. Simple
geometry is then used to reconstruct the dimensions and orientation of
spherical, cylindrical and cuboid objects. The prototype system was implemented
using depth sensor to simulate the scan lines and vibrotactile feedback to aid
the user during aiming of the laser towards the target object. The prototype
was tested on ten able-bodied volunteers who used the semi-autonomous
prosthesis to grasp a set of ten objects of different shape, size and
orientation. The novel prototype was compared against the benchmark system,
which used the full depth data. The results showed that novel system could be
used to successfully handle all the objects, and that the performance improved
with training, although it was still somewhat worse compared to the benchmark.
The present study is therefore an important step towards building a compact
system for embedded depth sensing specialized for prosthesis grasping.

visibility of dark images with lighting noise. To handle the real-world
low-light images often with heavy and complex noise, some efforts have been
made for joint LLIE and denoising, which however only achieve inferior
restoration performance. We attribute it to two challenges: 1) in real-world
low-light images, noise is somewhat covered by low-lighting and the left noise
after denoising would be inevitably amplified during enhancement; 2) conversion
of raw data to sRGB would cause information loss and also more noise, and hence
prior LLIE methods trained on raw data are unsuitable for more common sRGB
images. In this work, we propose a novel Low-light Enhancement & Denoising
Network for real-world low-light images (RLED-Net) in the sRGB color space. In
RLED-Net, we apply a plug-and-play differentiable Latent Subspace
Reconstruction Block (LSRB) to embed the real-world images into low-rank
subspaces to suppress the noise and rectify the errors, such that the impact of
noise during enhancement can be effectively shrunk. We then present an
efficient Crossed-channel & Shift-window Transformer (CST) layer with two
branches to calculate the window and channel attentions to resist the
degradation (e.g., speckle noise and blur) caused by the noise in input images.
Based on the CST layers, we further present a U-structure network CSTNet as
backbone for deep feature recovery, and construct a feature refine block to
refine the final features. Extensive experiments on both real noisy images and
public image databases well verify the effectiveness of the proposed RLED-Net
for RLLIE and denoising simultaneously.

differential geometry. Such generalizations usually involve extending the
tangent bundle to larger vector bundles equipped with various algebroid
structures. The most general geometric scheme is not well understood yet, and a
unifying framework for such algebroid structures is needed. Our aim in this
paper is to propose such a general framework. Our strategy is to follow the
hierarchy of defining axioms for a Courant algebroid: almost-Courant - metric -
pre-Courant - Courant. In particular, we focus on the symmetric part of the
bracket and the metric invariance property, and try to make sense of them in a
manner as general as possible. These ideas lead us to define new algebroid
structures which we dub Bourbaki and metric-Bourbaki algebroids. For a special
case of exact pre-metric-Bourbaki algebroids, we construct maps which
generalize the Cartan calculus of exterior derivative, Lie derivative and
interior product. This is done by a reverse-mathematical analysis of Severa
classification of exact Courant algebroids. Abstracting crucial properties of
these maps, we define the notion of Bourbaki pre-calculus. Conversely, given a
Bourbaki pre-calculus, we construct a pre-metric-Bourbaki algebroid with a
standard bracket analogous to Dorfman bracket. We prove that any exact
pre-metric-Bourbaki algebroid satisfying certain conditions has to have a
bracket that is the twisted version of the standard bracket. We prove that many
algebroids from the literature are examples of these new algebroids. One
straightforward generalization of our constructions might be done by replacing
the tangent bundle with a Lie algebroid A. This step allows us to define
A-Bourbaki algebroids and Bourbaki A-pre-calculus, and extend our results,
while proving many other algebroids from the literature fit into this
framework.

interaction with the NEID spectrograph is handled through a pair of graphical

global optimization problem even with each participating agent only having
access to a local partial view of the objective function. Despite making
significant inroads, most existing results on distributed optimization rely on
noise-free information sharing among the agents, which is problematic when
communication channels are noisy, messages are coarsely quantized, or shared
information are obscured by additive noise for the purpose of achieving
differential privacy. The problem of information-sharing noise is particularly
pronounced in the state-of-the-art gradient-tracking based distributed
optimization algorithms, in that information-sharing noise will accumulate with
iterations on the gradient-tracking estimate of these algorithms, and the
ensuing variance will even grow unbounded when the noise is persistent. This
paper proposes a new gradient-tracking based distributed optimization approach
that can avoid information-sharing noise from accumulating in the gradient
estimation. The approach is applicable even when the {inter-agent interaction
is} time-varying, which is key to enable the incorporation of a decaying factor
in inter-agent interaction to gradually eliminate the influence of
information-sharing noise. In fact, we rigorously prove that the proposed
approach can ensure the almost sure convergence of all agents to the same
optimal solution even in the presence of persistent information-sharing noise.
The approach is applicable to general directed graphs. It is also capable of
ensuring the almost sure convergence of all agents to an optimal solution when
the gradients are noisy, which is common in machine learning applications.
Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

interorbital pairing is uniquely capable of displaying odd-parity

of optimal initial velocity perturbations and the subsequent mixing changes
between initially rectilinear `stripes' of scalar and disc-like `drops'. We
find that the ensuing stirring of the initial velocity perturbations varies
considerably depending on the geometry of the initial scalar distribution.
  Secondly, we examine the case of lattices of multiple initial `drops' of
scalar and investigate how the structure of optimal perturbations varies with
appropriately scaled P\'eclet number defined in terms of the drop scale rather
than the domain scale. We find that the characteristic structure of the optimal
initial velocity perturbation we observe for a single drop is upheld as the
number of drops and $Pe$ increase. However, the characteristic vortex structure
{\color{red} and associated mixing exhibits some nonlocal variability,}
suggesting that rescaling to a local $Pe$ {\color{red} will} not capture all
the significant flow dynamics.

of soft materials, including soft tissues, in a non-invasive manner and finds
broad applications in a variety of disciplines. The state-of-the-art SWE
methods commercialized in various instruments rely on the measurement of shear
wave velocities to infer material parameters and have relatively low resolution
and accuracy for inhomogeneous soft materials due to the complexity of wave
fields. In the present study, we overcome this challenge by proposing a
physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based SWE (SWENet) method considering
the merits of PINN in solving an inverse problem. The spatial variation of
elastic properties of inhomogeneous materials has been defined in governing
equations, which are encoded in PINN as loss functions. Snapshots of wave
motion inside a local region have been used to train the neural networks, and
during this course, the spatial distribution of elastic properties is inferred
simultaneously. Both finite element simulations and tissue-mimicking phantom
experiments have been performed to validate the method. Our results show that
the shear moduli of soft composites consisting of matrix and inclusions of
several millimeters in cross-section dimensions with either regular or
irregular geometries can be identified with good accuracy. The advantages of
the SWENet over conventional SWE methods consist of using more features of the
wave motion in inhomogeneous soft materials and enabling seamless integration
of multi-source data in the inverse analysis. Given the advantages of the
reported method, it may find applications including but not limited to
mechanical characterization of artificial soft biomaterials, imaging elastic
properties of nerves in vivo, and differentiating small malignant tumors from
benign ones by quantitatively measuring their distinct stiffnesses.

adversarial training for multiple perturbations (ATMP) is proposed to
generalize the adversarial robustness over different perturbation types (in
$\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, and $\ell_\infty$ norm-bounded perturbations). However, the
resulting model exhibits trade-off between different attacks. Meanwhile, there
is no theoretical analysis of ATMP, limiting its further development. In this
paper, we first provide the smoothness analysis of ATMP and show that $\ell_1$,
$\ell_2$, and $\ell_\infty$ adversaries give different contributions to the
smoothness of the loss function of ATMP. Based on this, we develop the
stability-based excess risk bounds and propose adaptive smoothness-weighted
adversarial training for multiple perturbations. Theoretically, our algorithm
yields better bounds. Empirically, our experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100

this problem in the literature use some mechanistic models in conjunction with
either a simulation-based or solution-based optimization scheme. In this paper,
we study an automatic approach of learning the parameters of neuron populations
from a training set consisting of pairs of spiking series and parameter labels

require additional simulations at inference time nor expert knowledge in
deriving an analytical solution or in constructing some approximate models. We
simulate many neuronal populations with different parameter settings using a
stochastic neuron model. Using that data, we train a variety of supervised
machine learning models, including convolutional and deep neural networks,
random forest, and support vector regression. We then compare their performance
against classical approaches including a genetic search, Bayesian sequential
estimation, and a random walk approximate model. The supervised models almost
always outperform the classical methods in parameter estimation and spike
reconstruction errors, and computation expense. Convolutional neural network,
in particular, is the best among all models across all metrics. The supervised
