Offshore, these localised fluid-expulsion events are archived in the geologic
record by the resulting pockmarks at the sea-floor. Venting is widely
interpreted to occur via hydraulic fracturing, which requires near-lithostatic
pore pressures for initiation. One common driver for these extreme pressures is
horizontal tectonic compression, which pressurises the entire sedimentary
column over a wide region. Fluid expulsion leads to a sudden, local relief of
this pressure, which then gradually recharges through continued compression,
leading to episodic venting. Pressure recharge will also occur through pressure
diffusion from neighbouring regions that remain pressurised, but the combined
role of compression and pressure diffusion in episodic venting has not
previously been considered. Here, we develop a novel poroelastic model for
episodic, compression-driven venting. We show that compression and pressure
diffusion together set the resulting venting period. We derive a simple
analytical expression for this venting period, demonstrating that pressure
diffusion can significantly reduce the venting period associated with a given
rate of compression. Our expression allows this rate of compression to be
inferred from observations of episodic venting. We conclude that pressure
diffusion is a major contributor to episodic fluid venting in
mudstone-dominated basins.

eigenvalues, up to roundoff error. An eigenfunction expansion of the solution
is then constructed. The computational expense of obtaining each eigenpair is
independent of the grid size. The accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of this

focused on how to extend 3D human datasets and temporal-based learning to
promote accuracy and temporal smoothing. Different from them, our STR aims to
learn accurate and natural motion sequences in an unconstrained environment
through temporal and spatial tendency and to fully excavate the spatio-temporal
features of existing video data. To this end, our STR learns the representation
of features in the temporal and spatial dimensions respectively, to concentrate
on a more robust representation of spatio-temporal features. More specifically,
for efficient temporal modeling, we first propose a temporal tendency reasoning
(TTR) module. TTR constructs a time-dimensional hierarchical residual
connection representation within a video sequence to effectively reason
temporal sequences' tendencies and retain effective dissemination of human
information. Meanwhile, for enhancing the spatial representation, we design a
spatial tendency enhancing (STE) module to further learns to excite spatially
time-frequency domain sensitive features in human motion information
representations. Finally, we introduce integration strategies to integrate and
refine the spatio-temporal feature representations. Extensive experimental
findings on large-scale publically available datasets reveal that our STR

nameplate capacity of plants. More accurate knowledge of inertia constants of
individual power plants would give greater transparency to decisions of the
transmission system operator (TSO) and to auctions for the procurement of

reverse-engineer the inertia constants of individual power plants from the
historical values of their power production and from aggregate values of

Great Britain (GB), where historical values for aggregate inertia are published

problem in robotics. Reinforcement learning systems have the potential to learn
autonomously via trial-and-error, but in practice the costs of manual reward

to preclude real world deployment. Imitation learning approaches, on the other
hand, offer a simple way to learn control in the real world, but typically
require costly curated demonstration data and lack a mechanism for continuous
improvement. Recently, iterative imitation techniques have been shown to learn
goal directed control from undirected demonstration data, and improve
continuously via self-supervised goal reaching, but results thus far have been
limited to simulated environments. In this work, we present evidence that
iterative imitation learning can scale to goal-directed behavior on a real
robot in a dynamic setting: high speed, precision table tennis (e.g. ""land the
ball on this particular target""). We find that this approach offers a
straightforward way to do continuous on-robot learning, without complexities
such as reward design or sim-to-real transfer. It is also scalable -- sample
efficient enough to train on a physical robot in just a few hours. In real
world evaluations, we find that the resulting policy can perform on par or
better than amateur humans (with players sampled randomly from a robotics lab)
at the task of returning the ball to specific targets on the table. Finally, we
analyze the effect of an initial undirected bootstrap dataset size on

a knowledge distillation framework to mutually improve the performance of both

teacher network, which is trained with weak bag labels, and an instance
classifier is used as the student network, which is trained using the
normalized attention scores obtained from the teacher network as soft pseudo
labels for the instances in positive bags. An instance feature extractor is
shared between the teacher and the student to further enhance the knowledge
exchange between them. In addition, we propose a hard positive instance mining
strategy based on the output of the student network to force the teacher
network to keep mining hard positive instances. WENO is a plug-and-play

sciences and fields such as graph neural networks. The brain is a perfect
example of such a complex system, where communication between brain regions is
constantly being orchestrated. To analyze communication, the brain is often
split up into anatomical regions that each perform certain computations. These
regions must interact and communicate with each other to perform tasks and
support higher-level cognition. On a macroscale, these regions communicate
through signal propagation along the cortex and along white matter tracts over
longer distances. When and what types of signals are communicated over time is
an unsolved problem and is often studied using either functional or structural
data. In this paper, we propose a non-linear generative approach to
communication from functional data. We address three issues with common
connectivity approaches by explicitly modeling the directionality of
communication, finding communication at each timestep, and encouraging
sparsity. To evaluate our model, we simulate temporal data that has sparse
communication between nodes embedded in it and show that our model can uncover
the expected communication dynamics. Subsequently, we apply our model to
temporal neural data from multiple tasks and show that our approach models
communication that is more specific to each task. The specificity of our method
means it can have an impact on the understanding of psychiatric disorders,
which are believed to be related to highly specific communication between brain
regions compared to controls. In sum, we propose a general model for dynamic
communication learning on graphs, and show its applicability to a subfield of
the natural sciences, with potential widespread scientific impact.

found in various fields such as the manufacturing industry, the service
industry and the technology industry. A scheduling problem (NP-hard) is a task
of finding a sequence of job assignments on a given set of machines with the
goal of optimizing the objective defined. Methods such as Operation Research,
Dispatching Rules, and Combinatorial Optimization have been applied to
scheduling problems but no solution guarantees to find the optimal solution.
The recent development of Reinforcement Learning has shown success in
sequential decision-making problems. This research presents a Reinforcement

an OpenAI gym environment with search-space reduction for Job Shop Scheduling
Problems and provides a heuristic-guided Q-Learning solution with
state-of-the-art performance for Multi-agent Flexible Job Shop Problems.

related problems as the former can be calculated from the latter. However, the
surface normals computed from the output of depth estimation methods are
significantly less accurate than the surface normals directly estimated by
networks. To reduce such discrepancy, we introduce a novel framework that uses
surface normal and its uncertainty to recurrently refine the predicted
depth-map. The depth of each pixel can be propagated to a query pixel, using
the predicted surface normal as guidance. We thus formulate depth refinement as
a classification of choosing the neighboring pixel to propagate from. Then, by
propagating to sub-pixel points, we upsample the refined, low-resolution
output. The proposed method shows state-of-the-art performance on NYUv2 and
iBims-1 - both in terms of depth and normal. Our refinement module can also be
attached to the existing depth estimation methods to improve their accuracy. We
also show that our framework, only trained for depth estimation, can also be

are utilized by the Building Management Systems (BMSs) to control and monitor
the negative pressure in an NPR. This paper demonstrates a non-invasive and
stealthy attack on NPRs by spoofing a DPS at its resonant frequency. Our
contributions are: (1) We show that DPSs used in NPRs typically have resonant
frequencies in the audible range. (2) We use this finding to design malicious
music to create resonance in DPSs, resulting in an overshooting in the DPS's
normal pressure readings. (3) We show how the resonance in DPSs can fool the
BMSs so that the NPR turns its negative pressure to a positive one, causing a
potential \textit{leak} of deadly microbes from NPRs. We do experiments on 8
DPSs from 5 different manufacturers to evaluate their resonant frequencies
considering the sampling tube length and find resonance in 6 DPSs. We can
achieve a 2.5 Pa change in negative pressure from a $\sim$7 cm distance when a

sampling tube length. We also introduce an interval-time variation approach for
an adversarial control over the negative pressure and show that the

  Functional Methods","17 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, submitted to ChemPhysChem",,,,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.other","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Density functional theory (DFT) provides convenient electronic structure
methods for the study of molecular systems and materials. Regular Kohn-Sham DFT
calculations rely on unitary transformations to determine the ground-state
electronic density, ground state energy, and related properties. However, for
dissociation of molecular systems into open-shell fragments, due to the
self-interaction error present in a large number of density functional
approximations, the self-consistent procedure based on the this type of
transformation gives rise to the well-known charge delocalization problem. To
avoid this issue, we showed previously that the cluster operator of
coupled-cluster theory can be utilized within the context of DFT to solve in an
alternative and approximate fashion the ground-state self-consistent problem.
This work further examines the application of the singles cluster operator to
molecular ground state calculations. Two approximations are derived and
explored: i), A linearized scheme of the quadratic equation used to determine
the cluster amplitudes, and, ii), the effect of carrying the calculations in a
non-self-consistent field fashion. These approaches are found to be capable of
improving the energy and density of the system and are quite stable in either
case. The theoretical framework discussed in this work could be used to
describe, with an added flexibility, quantum systems that display challenging
features and require expanded theoretical methods.

study the renormalization of the Yukawa (gluino-quark-squark interactions) and
the quartic (four-squark interactions) couplings. At the quantum level, these
interactions suffer from mixing with other operators which have the same
transformation properties. We exploit the symmetries of the action, such as
charge conjugation and parity, in order to reduce the allowed mixing patterns.
To deduce the renormalizations and the mixing coefficients we compute,
perturbatively to one-loop and to the lowest order in the lattice spacing, the
relevant three-point and four-point Green's functions using both dimensional
and lattice regularizations. Our lattice formulation involves the Wilson
discretization for the gluino and quark fields; for gluons we employ the Wilson
gauge action; for scalar fields (squarks) we use na\""ive discretization. We
obtain analytic expressions for the renormalization and mixing coefficients of
the Yukawa couplings; they are functions of the number of colors $N_c$, the
gauge parameter $\alpha$, and the gauge coupling $g$. Furthermore, preliminary
results on the quartic couplings are also presented.

due to their human-level accuracy. While existing works mostly focus on either
improving accuracy or testing accuracy robustness, the computation efficiency
of NMT systems, which is of paramount importance due to often vast translation
demands and real-time requirements, has surprisingly received little attention.
In this paper, we make the first attempt to understand and test potential
computation efficiency robustness in state-of-the-art NMT systems. By analyzing
the working mechanism and implementation of 1455 public-accessible NMT systems,
we observe a fundamental property in NMT systems that could be manipulated in
an adversarial manner to reduce computation efficiency significantly. Our key
motivation is to generate test inputs that could sufficiently delay the
generation of EOS such that NMT systems would have to go through enough
iterations to satisfy the pre-configured threshold. We present NMTSloth, which
develops a gradient-guided technique that searches for a minimal and
unnoticeable perturbation at character-level, token-level, and structure-level,
which sufficiently delays the appearance of EOS and forces these inputs to
reach the naturally-unreachable threshold. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
NMTSloth, we conduct a systematic evaluation on three public-available NMT
systems: Google T5, AllenAI WMT14, and Helsinki-NLP translators. Experimental
results show that NMTSloth can increase NMT systems' response latency and
energy consumption by 85% to 3153% and 86% to 3052%, respectively, by
perturbing just one character or token in the input sentence. Our case study
shows that inputs generated by NMTSloth significantly affect the battery power
in real-world mobile devices (i.e., drain more than 30 times battery power than
normal inputs).

classifier is calibrated). It has been shown that common models fail to satisfy
this property, making reliable methods for measuring and improving calibration
important tools. Unfortunately, obtaining these is far from trivial for
problems with many classes. We propose two techniques that can be used in
tandem. First, a reduced calibration method transforms the original problem
into a simpler one. We prove for several notions of calibration that solving
the reduced problem minimizes the corresponding notion of miscalibration in the
full problem, allowing the use of non-parametric recalibration methods that
fail in higher dimensions. Second, we propose class-wise calibration methods,
based on intuition building on a phenomenon called neural collapse and the
observation that most of the accurate classifiers found in practice can be
thought of as a union of K different functions which can be recalibrated
separately, one for each class. These typically out-perform their non
class-wise counterparts, especially for classifiers trained on imbalanced data
sets. Applying the two methods together results in class-wise reduced
calibration algorithms, which are powerful tools for reducing the prediction

RRT*, typically use geometric or kinematic collision check algorithms to ensure
collision-free paths toward the target position. However, such approaches may
generate non-smooth paths that do not comply with the dynamics constraints of
walking robots. It has been shown that the control barrier function (CBF) can
be integrated with RRT/RRT* to synthesize dynamically feasible collision-free
paths. Yet, existing work has been limited to simple circular or elliptical
shape obstacles due to the challenging nature of constructing appropriate
barrier functions to represent irregular-shaped obstacles. In this paper, we
present a CBF-based RRT* algorithm for bipedal robots to generate a
collision-free path through complex space with polynomial-shaped obstacles. In
particular, we used logistic regression to construct polynomial barrier
functions from a grid map of the environment to represent arbitrarily shaped
obstacles. Moreover, we developed a multi-step CBF steering controller to
ensure the efficiency of free space exploration. The proposed approach was
first validated in simulation for a differential drive model, and then
experimentally evaluated with a 3D humanoid robot, Digit, in a lab setting with

frequency. We show how these oscillations lead to broadening and shifting of
the Voigt profile of the Ly$\alpha$ forest, in a manner that is correlated with
the local dark matter density. We further show how tomographic methods allow
the effect to be reconstructed by observing the Ly$\alpha$ forest spectrum of

action on vectors that are suitable for parallel programming. Solving
appropriate simple linear systems of equations in parallel (or computing the
inverse of several matrices) and with a proper linear combination of the
results, allows us to obtain new high order approximations to the desired
functions of matrices. An error analysis to obtain forward and backward error
bounds is presented. The coefficients of each method, which depends on the
number of processors, can be adjusted to improve the accuracy, the stability or
to reduce round off errors of the methods. We illustrate this procedure by
explicitly constructing some methods which are then tested on several numerical
examples.

often been explained via the development of storm-generated streamwise
vorticity along a baroclinic gradient in the forward flank of supercells.
However, the ambient streamwise vorticity of the environment (often quantified
via storm-relative helicity), especially near the ground, is particularly
skillful at discriminating between nontornadic and tornadic supercells. This
study investigates whether the origins of the inflow air into supercell
low-level mesocyclones, both horizontally and vertically, can help explain the
dynamical role of environmental versus storm-generated vorticity in the
development of low-level mesocyclone rotation. Simulations of supercells,
initialized with wind profiles common to supercell environments observed in
nature, show that the air bound for the low-level mesocyclone primarily
originates from the undisturbed, ambient environment, rather than from along
the forward flank, and from very close to the ground, often in the lowest 200 -
400 m of the atmosphere. Given that the near-ground environmental air comprises
the bulk of the inflow into low-level mesocyclones, this likely explains the
forecast skill of environmental streamwise vorticity in the lowest few hundred
meters of the atmosphere. The low-level mesocyclone does not appear to require
much augmentation from the development of additional horizontal vorticity in
the forward flank. Instead, the dominant contributor to vertical vorticity
within the low-level mesocyclone is from the environmental horizontal
vorticity. This study hopefully clarifies the development of low-level
mesocyclones in supercells.

  Uniqueness of optimal states",,,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present in this paper that the CHSH game admits one and only one optimal
state and so remove all ambiguity of representations. More precisely, we use
the well-known universal description of quantum commuting correlations as state
space on the universal algebra for two player games, and so allows us to
unambigiously compare quantum strategies as states on this common algebra. As
such we find that the CHSH game leaves a single optimal state on this common
algebra. In turn passing to any non-minimal Stinespring dilation for this
unique optimal state is the only source of ambiguity (including self-testing):
More precisely, any state on some operator algebra may be uniquely broken up
into its minimal Stinespring dilation as an honest representation for the
operator algebra followed by its vector state. Any other Stinespring dilation
however arises simply as an extension of the minimal Stinespring dilation
(i.e., as an embedding of the minimal Hilbert space into some random ambient
one). As such this manifests the only source of ambiguity appearing in most
(but not all!) traditional self-testing results such as for the CHSH game as
well as in plenty of similar examples. We then further demonstrate the
simplicity of our arguments on the Mermin--Peres magic square and magic
pentagram game.
  Most importantly however, we present this article as an illustration of
operator algebraic techniques on optimal states and their quotients, and we
further pick up the results of the current article in another following one
(currently under preparation) to derive a first robust self-testing result in
the quantum commuting model.

vehicles for users of a smart city requires determining the assignment of the
vehicles to the users and their routing in conjunction with their speed. Such
decisions must ensure low emission, efficiency, and high service quality by
also considering the impact on traffic congestion caused by other vehicles in
the transportation network.
  In this paper, we first propose an abstract trilevel multi-objective
formulation architecture to model all vehicle routing problems with assignment,
routing, and speed decision variables and conflicting objective functions. Such
an architecture guides the development of subproblems, relaxations, and
solution methods. We also propose a way of integrating the various urban
transportation services by introducing a constraint on the speed variables that
takes into account the traffic volume caused across the different services.
Based on the formulation architecture, we introduce a (bilevel) problem where
assignment and routing are at the upper level and speed is at the lower level.
To address the challenge of dealing with routing problems on urban road
networks, we develop an algorithm that alternates between the
assignment-routing problem on an auxiliary complete graph and the speed
optimization problem on the original non-complete graph. The computational
experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in determining
approximate Pareto fronts among the conflicting objectives.

various security issues, such as leaking heap-address and causing bit-flip in
the physical memory. The most essential requirement for successful memory
deduplication is to provide identical copies of a physical page. Recent works
use a brute-force approach to create identical copies of a physical page that
is an inaccurate and time-consuming primitive from the attacker's perspective.
  Our work begins to fill this gap by providing a domain-specific structured
way to duplicate a physical page in cloud settings in the context of industrial
control systems (ICSs). Here, we show a new attack primitive -
\textit{BayesImposter}, which points out that the attacker can duplicate the
.bss section of the target control DLL file of cloud protocols using the
\textit{Bayesian estimation} technique. Our approach results in less memory
(i.e., 4 KB compared to GB) and time (i.e., 13 minutes compared to hours)
compared to the brute-force approach used in recent works. We point out that
ICSs can be expressed as state-space models; hence, the \textit{Bayesian
estimation} is an ideal choice to be combined with memory deduplication for a
successful attack in cloud settings. To demonstrate the strength of
\textit{BayesImposter}, we create a real-world automation platform using a
scaled-down automated high-bay warehouse and industrial-grade SIMATIC S7-1500
PLC from Siemens as a target ICS. We demonstrate that \textit{BayesImposter}
can predictively inject false commands into the PLC that can cause possible
equipment damage with machine failure in the target ICS. Moreover, we show that
\textit{BayesImposter} is capable of adversarial control over the target ICS
resulting in severe consequences, such as killing a person but making it looks
like an accident. Therefore, we also provide countermeasures to prevent the
attack.

cosmological power spectrum is a complicated process. In a delay-based
analysis, the mapping between instrumental and cosmological space is not a
one-to-one relation. Instead, neighbouring modes contribute to the power
measured at one point, with their respective contributions encoded in the
window functions. To better understand the power measured by an interferometer,
we assess the impact of instrument characteristics and analysis choices on
these window functions. Focusing on the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array
(HERA) as a case study, we find that long-baseline observations correspond to
enhanced low-k tails of the window functions, which facilitate foreground
leakage, whilst an informed choice of bandwidth and frequency taper can reduce
said tails. With simple test cases and realistic simulations, we show that,
apart from tracing mode mixing, the window functions help accurately
reconstruct the power spectrum estimator of simulated visibilities. The window
functions depend strongly on the beam chromaticity, and less on its spatial
structure - a Gaussian approximation, ignoring side lobes, is sufficient.
Finally, we investigate the potential of asymmetric window functions,
down-weighting the contribution of low-k power to avoid foreground leakage. The
window functions presented here correspond to the latest HERA upper limits for
the full Phase I data. They allow an accurate reconstruction of the power
spectrum measured by the instrument and will be used in future analyses to
confront theoretical models and data directly in cylindrical space.

relation is given by $1/N$, with regard to an appropriate distance measure. For
large systems, $N$ is much smaller than the dimension of the exact dual matrix

rapid quenching, but it is unclear whether all quiescent galaxies have gone
through this phase and what physical mechanisms are involved. To study rapid
quenching, we use rest-frame colors to select 12 young quiescent galaxies at $z
\sim 1.5$. From spectral energy distribution fitting, we find that they all
experienced intense starbursts prior to rapid quenching. We confirm this with
deep Magellan/FIRE spectroscopic observations for a subset of seven galaxies.
Broad emission lines are detected for two galaxies and are most likely caused
by AGN activity. The other five galaxies do not show any emission features,
suggesting that gas has already been removed or depleted. Most of the rapidly
quenched galaxies are more compact than normal quiescent galaxies, providing
evidence for a central starburst in the recent past. We estimate an average
transition time of $300\,\rm Myr$ for the rapid quenching phase. Approximately
$4\%$ of quiescent galaxies at $z=1.5$ have gone through rapid quenching; this
fraction increases to $23\%$ at $z=2.2$. We identify analogs in the TNG100
simulation and find that rapid quenching for these galaxies is driven by AGN,
and for half of the cases, gas-rich major mergers seem to trigger the
starburst. We conclude that these massive quiescent galaxies are not just
rapidly quenched but also rapidly formed through a major starburst. We
speculate that mergers drive gas inflow towards the central regions and grow
supermassive black holes, leading to rapid quenching by AGN feedback.

While the tuning does not wash out sterile neutrino oscillation patterns, cross

has a secondary anti-correlation with $\Sigma _{SFR}$ (i.e. a

find that $\Sigma_{H_2}$ is less important than $\Sigma_{SFR}$ in determining
the local metallicity. This result indicates that gas accretion, resulting in
local metallicity dilution and local boosting of star formation, is unlikely to
be the primary origin of the rFMR. The local metallicity depends also on the
global properties of galaxies. We find a strong dependence on the total stellar
mass ($M_*$) and a weaker (inverse) dependence on the total SFR. The global
metallicity scaling relations, therefore, do not simply stem out of their
resolved counterparts; global properties and processes, such as the global
gravitational potential well, galaxy-scale winds and global
redistribution/mixing of metals, likely contribute to the local metallicity, in
addition to local production and retention.

simulations of collapsars reveal that the jet is continuously loaded with
baryons, owing to strong mixing with the cocoon. This results in a high
photosphere at $\gtrsim 10^{12}$ cm. Consequently, collisionless internal
shocks below the photosphere are disfavored, and the neutrino production in the
deepest jet regions is prevented, in contrast to what has been assumed in the
literature. We find that subphotospheric neutrino production could only take
place in the presence of collisionless sub-shocks or magnetic reconnection.
Efficient particle acceleration is not possible in the cocoon, at the
cocoon-counter cocoon shock interface, or at the shock driven by the cocoon in
the event of a jet halted in an extended envelope. These subphotospheric
neutrinos have energy $E_\nu \lesssim 10^5$ GeV for initial jet magnetizations

broad spectral ranges up to the X-ray region. A key limitation of these systems
is that the light they emit is for the most part classical. We challenge this
paradigm by building a quantum-optical theory of strongly driven many-body
systems, showing that the presence of correlations among the emitters creates
emission of nonclassical many-photon states of light. We consider the example
of high-harmonic generation (HHG), by which a strongly driven system emits
photons at integer multiples of the drive frequency. In the conventional case
of uncorrelated emitters, the harmonics are in an almost perfectly multi-mode
coherent state lacking any correlation between harmonics. By contrast, a
correlation of the emitters prior to the strong drive is converted onto
nonclassical features of the output light, including doubly-peaked photon
statistics, ring-shaped Wigner functions, and quantum correlations between
harmonics. We propose schemes for implementing these concepts, creating the
correlations between emitters via an interaction between them or their joint
interaction with the background electromagnetic field (as in superradiance). By
tuning the time at which these processes are interrupted by the strong drive,
one can control the amount of correlations between the emitters, and
correspondingly the deviation of the emitted light from a classical state. Our
work paves the way towards the engineering of novel many-photon states of light
over a broadband spectrum of frequencies, and suggests HHG as a diagnostic tool
for characterizing correlations in many-body systems with attosecond temporal

companions is $0.11_{-0.05}^{+0.07}$. We define a control sample of
star-forming galaxies with the same stellar masses and redshifts as the green
peas, but consistent with the star-formation main sequence. We find that green
pea galaxies are as likely to have companions as the control sample; for which
the fraction of objects with companions is $0.08_{-0.03}^{+0.05}$. Given that
we do not find statistical evidence for an elevated companion fraction in the

In this area, one wishes to monitor the vertices and/or the edges of a network
(viewed as a graph) in order to detect and prevent failures. Inspired by two
notions studied in the literature (edge-geodetic sets and
distance-edge-monitoring sets), we define the notion of a monitoring
edge-geodetic set (MEG-set for short) of a graph $G$ as an edge-geodetic set
$S\subseteq V(G)$ of $G$ (that is, every edge of $G$ lies on some shortest path
between two vertices of $S$) with the additional property that for every edge
$e$ of $G$, there is a vertex pair $x, y$ of $S$ such that $e$ lies on
\emph{all} shortest paths between $x$ and $y$. The motivation is that, if some
edge $e$ is removed from the network (for example if it ceases to function),
the monitoring probes $x$ and $y$ will detect the failure since the distance
between them will increase.
  We explore the notion of MEG-sets by deriving the minimum size of a MEG-set
for some basic graph classes (trees, cycles, unicyclic graphs, complete graphs,
grids, hypercubes,...) and we prove an upper bound using the feedback edge set
of the graph.

that the optimal gait should deal with various situations for high-resolution
of motion planning, e.g., steering the robot or moving in ""baby steps."" As the
step size or steering ratio increases or decreases, the optimal gaits will
slightly vary by the geometric relationship and they will form the families of

science, from classical or quantum mechanics to biology, to human assemblies.
Traditionally, the main focus has been the identification of threshold
parameter values for the transition to synchronization as well as the nature of
such transition. Here, we show that considering an oscillator lattice as a
discrete growing interface provides unique insights into the dynamical process
whereby the lattice reaches synchronization for long times. Working on a
generalization of the Kuramoto model that allows for odd or non-odd couplings,
we elucidate synchronization of oscillator lattices as an instance of generic
scale invariance, whereby the system displays space-time criticality, largely
irrespective of parameter values. The critical properties of the system (like
scaling exponent values and the dynamic scaling Ansatz which is satisfied) fall
into universality classes of kinetically rough interfaces with columnar
disorder, namely, those of the Edwards-Wilkinson (equivalently, the Larkin
model of an elastic interface in a random medium) or the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang
(KPZ) equations, for Kuramoto (odd) coupling and generic (non-odd) couplings,
respectively. From the point of view of kinetic roughening, the critical
properties we find turn out to be quite innovative, especially concerning the
statistics of the fluctuations as characterized by their probability
distribution function (PDF) and covariance. While the latter happens to be that
of the Larkin model irrespective of the symmetry of the coupling, in the
generic non-odd coupling case the PDF turns out to be the Tracy-Widom
distribution associated with the KPZ nonlinearity. This brings the
synchronization of oscillator lattices into a remarkably large class of
strongly-correlated, low-dimensional (classical and quantum) systems with
strong universal fluctuations.

reduce the performance of downstream machine analytics. Although many works
have been designed for low-light enhancement or domain adaptive machine
analytics, the former considers less on high-level vision, while the latter
neglects the potential of image-level signal adjustment. How to restore
underexposed images/videos from the perspective of machine vision has long been
overlooked. In this paper, we are the first to propose a learnable illumination
enhancement model for high-level vision. Inspired by real camera response
functions, we assume that the illumination enhancement function should be a
concave curve, and propose to satisfy this concavity through discrete integral.
With the intention of adapting illumination from the perspective of machine
vision without task-specific annotated data, we design an asymmetric
cross-domain self-supervised training strategy. Our model architecture and
training designs mutually benefit each other, forming a powerful unsupervised
normal-to-low light adaptation framework. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses existing low-light enhancement and adaptation methods
and shows superior generalization on various low-light vision tasks, including

domain of pre-training datasets (music or generic audio) and the pre-training
methodology (supervised or unsupervised) affects the adequacy of the resulting
audio embeddings for downstream tasks.
  We show that models trained via supervised learning on large-scale
expert-annotated music datasets achieve state-of-the-art performance in a wide
range of music labelling tasks, each with novel content and vocabularies. This
can be done in an efficient manner with models containing less than 100 million
parameters that require no fine-tuning or reparameterization for downstream
tasks, making this approach practical for industry-scale audio catalogs.
  Within the class of unsupervised learning strategies, we show that the domain
of the training dataset can significantly impact the performance of
representations learned by the model. We find that restricting the domain of
the pre-training dataset to music allows for training with smaller batch sizes
while achieving state-of-the-art in unsupervised learning -- and in some cases,
supervised learning -- for music understanding.
  We also corroborate that, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on
many tasks, supervised learning can cause models to specialize to the

networks in the low-label regime, through applying the contrastive learning
approach from images/graphs (we refer to it as HyperGCL). We focus on the
following question: How to construct contrastive views for hypergraphs via
augmentations? We provide the solutions in two folds. First, guided by domain
knowledge, we fabricate two schemes to augment hyperedges with higher-order
relations encoded, and adopt three vertex augmentation strategies from
graph-structured data. Second, in search of more effective views in a
data-driven manner, we for the first time propose a hypergraph generative model
to generate augmented views, and then an end-to-end differentiable pipeline to
jointly learn hypergraph augmentations and model parameters. Our technical
innovations are reflected in designing both fabricated and generative
augmentations of hypergraphs. The experimental findings include: (i) Among
fabricated augmentations in HyperGCL, augmenting hyperedges provides the most
numerical gains, implying that higher-order information in structures is
usually more downstream-relevant; (ii) Generative augmentations do better in
preserving higher-order information to further benefit generalizability; (iii)
HyperGCL also boosts robustness and fairness in hypergraph representation

  Optimization",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) addresses the problem of learning a
performant policy from a fixed batch of data collected by following some
behavior policy. Model-based approaches are particularly appealing in the
offline setting since they can extract more learning signals from the logged
dataset by learning a model of the environment. However, the performance of
existing model-based approaches falls short of model-free counterparts, due to
the compounding of estimation errors in the learned model. Driven by this
observation, we argue that it is critical for a model-based method to
understand when to trust the model and when to rely on model-free estimates,
and how to act conservatively w.r.t. both. To this end, we derive an elegant
and simple methodology called conservative Bayesian model-based value expansion
for offline policy optimization (CBOP), that trades off model-free and
model-based estimates during the policy evaluation step according to their
epistemic uncertainties, and facilitates conservatism by taking a lower bound
on the Bayesian posterior value estimate. On the standard D4RL continuous
control tasks, we find that our method significantly outperforms previous
model-based approaches: e.g., MOPO by $116.4$%, MOReL by $23.2$% and COMBO by
$23.7$%. Further, CBOP achieves state-of-the-art performance on $11$ out of
$18$ benchmark datasets while doing on par on the remaining datasets.

symmetric function expanded into the basis of elementary symmetric functions as
$X_G = \sum c_{\lambda}e_{\lambda}$, the sum of the coefficients $c_{\lambda}$
for $\lambda$ with exactly $k$ parts is equal to the number of acyclic
orientations of $G$ with exactly $k$ sinks.
  However, more is known. The $sink$ $sequence$ of an acyclic orientation of
$G$ is a tuple $(s_1,\dots,s_k)$ such that $s_1$ is the number of sinks of the
orientation, and recursively each $s_i$ with $i > 1$ is the number of sinks
remaining after deleting the sinks contributing to $s_1,\dots,s_{i-1}$.
Equivalently, the sink sequence gives the number of vertices at each level of
the poset induced by the acyclic orientation.
  A lesser-known follow-up result of Stanley's determines certain cases in
which we can find a sum of $e$-basis coefficients that gives the number of
acyclic orientations of $G$ with a given partial sink sequence. Of interest in
its own right, this result also admits as a corollary a simple proof of the
$e$-positivity of $X_G$ when the stability number of $G$ is $2$.
  In this paper, we prove a vertex-weighted generalization of this follow-up
result, and conjecture a stronger version that admits a similar combinatorial
interpretation for a much larger set of $e$-coefficient sums of chromatic
symmetric functions. In particular, the conjectured formula would give a
combinatorial interpretation for the sum of the coefficients $c_{\lambda}$ with
prescribed values of $\lambda_1'$ and $\lambda_2'$ for any unweighted claw-free
graph.

particular cases, the physical density can be written as a convolution between
a density function that depends on internal structure but not wave packet, and
a smearing function that depends on wave packet but not internal structure. In
these cases, the former constitutes a true internal density of the hadron. We
show that the light front densities often encountered in the literature qualify

  The DVRP on trees is of independent interest, because it is equivalent to the

We design a simple and natural approximation algorithm for the tree DVRP,

before the end of inflation, it escapes by building up quantum fluctuations in
a process known as stochastic tunnelling. In this work we study cosmological
fluctuations produced in such a scenario, and how likely they are to form
Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). This is done by using the stochastic-$\delta N$
formalism, which allows us to reconstruct the highly non-Gaussian tails of the
distribution function of the number of $e$-folds spent in the false-vacuum
state. We explore two different toy models, both analytically and numerically,
in order to identify which properties do or do not depend on the details of the
false-vacuum profile. We find that when the potential barrier is small enough
compared to its width, $\Delta V/V < \Delta\phi^2/M_{\text{Pl}}^2$, the
potential can be approximated as being flat between its two local extrema, so
results previously obtained in a ""flat quantum well'' apply. Otherwise, when
$\Delta V/V < V/M_{\text{Pl}}^4$, the PBH abundance depends exponentially on
the height of the potential barrier, and when $\Delta V/V > V/M_{\text{Pl}}^4$
it depends super-exponentially ( i.e. as the exponential of an exponential) on
the barrier height. In that later case PBHs are massively produced. This allows
us to quantify how much flat inflection points need to be fine-tuned. In a deep
false vacuum, we also find that slow-roll violations are typically encountered
unless the potential is close to linear. This motivates further investigations
to generalise our approach to non-slow-roll setups.

light-collecting power to detect and characterize potentially habitable
terrestrial exoplanets using high-contrast imaging for the first time. This
will only be achievable if the performance of Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes
(GSMTs) extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) systems are optimized to their full
potential. A key component of an ExAO system is the wavefront sensor (WFS),
which measures aberrations from atmospheric turbulence. A common choice in
current and next-generation instruments is the pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS).
ExAO systems require high spatial and temporal sampling of wavefronts to
optimize performance, and as a result, require large detectors for the WFS. We
present a closed-loop testbed demonstration of a three-sided pyramid wavefront
sensor (3PWFS) as an alternative to the conventional four-sided pyramid
wavefront (4PWFS) sensor for GSMT-ExAO applications on the new Comprehensive
Adaptive Optics and Coronagraph Test Instrument (CACTI). The 3PWFS is less
sensitive to read noise than the 4PWFS because it uses fewer detector pixels.
The 3PWFS has further benefits: a high-quality three-sided pyramid optic is
easier to manufacture than a four-sided pyramid. We detail the design of the
two components of the CACTI system, the adaptive optics simulator and the PWFS
testbed that includes both a 3PWFS and 4PWFS. A preliminary experiment was
performed on CACTI to study the performance of the 3PWFS to the 4PWFS in
varying strengths of turbulence using both the Raw Intensity and Slopes Map
signal processing methods. This experiment was repeated for a modulation radius
of 1.6 lambda/D and 3.25 lambda/D. We found that the performance of the two
wavefront sensors is comparable if modal loop gains are tuned.

focuses on challenging early detection, discussing current challenges and
potential solutions. Our literature survey suggests that the performance of
current ML methods is limited (less than 80%) and depends on various factors,

nonequilibrium systems, but also constitutes a fertile ground for novel
physics. Indeed, dynamic renormalization group (DRG) analyses have uncovered
many new universality classes (UCs) in polar active fluids (PAFs) - an
archetype of active matter systems. However, due to the inherent technical
difficulties in the DRG methodology, almost all previous studies have been
restricted to polar active fluids in the incompressible or infinitely
compressible (i.e., Malthusian) limits, and, when the $\epsilon$-expansion was
used in conjunction, to the one-loop level. Here, we use functional
renormalization group (FRG) methods to bypass some of these difficulties and
unveil for the first time novel critical behavior in compressible polar active
fluids, and calculate the corresponding critical exponents beyond the one-loop
level. Specifically, we investigate the multicritical point of compressible
PAFs, where the critical order-disorder transition coincides with critical
phase separation. We first study the critical phenomenon using a DRG analysis
and find that it is insufficient since two-loop effects are important to obtain
a nontrivial correction to the scaling exponents. We then remedy this defect by
using a FRG analysis. We find three novel universality classes and obtain their
critical exponents, which we then use to show that at least two of these
universality classes are out of equilibrium because they violate the
fluctuation-dissipation relation.

results focus on algorithms A that output an approximation to a function f of

that can be``tuned"" to small-enough values while incurring only a poly blowup
in the running time/space. We show that such algorithms can be made DP without
sacrificing accuracy, as long as the function f has small global sensitivity.
We achieve these results by applying the smooth sensitivity framework developed
by Nissim, Raskhodnikova, and Smith (STOC 2007).
  Our framework naturally applies to transform non-private FPRAS (resp. FPTAS)
algorithms into $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP (resp. $\epsilon$-DP) approximation
algorithms. We apply our framework in the context of sublinear-time and
sublinear-space algorithms, while preserving the nature of the algorithm in
meaningful ranges of the parameters. Our results include the first (to the best
of our knowledge) $(\epsilon,\delta)$-edge DP sublinear-time algorithm for
estimating the number of triangles, the number of connected components, and the
weight of a MST of a graph, as well as a more efficient algorithm (while
sacrificing pure DP in contrast to previous results) for estimating the average
degree of a graph. In the area of streaming algorithms, our results include
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP algorithms for estimating L_p-norms, distinct elements,
and weighted MST for both insertion-only and turnstile streams. Our
transformation also provides a private version of the smooth histogram
framework, which is commonly used for converting streaming algorithms into
sliding window variants, and achieves a multiplicative approximation to many
problems, such as estimating L_p-norms, distinct elements, and the length of
the longest increasing subsequence.

traced by CO(2-1). We find that the molecular gas content is unrelated to the
rate of star formation decline prior to the most recent 1 Gyr, suggesting that
the gas reservoirs are not leftover from their primary star formation epoch.
However, the recent SFHs of CO-detected galaxies demonstrate evidence for
secondary bursts of star formation in their last Gyr. The fraction of stellar
mass formed in these secondary bursts ranges from
$\mathrm{f_{burst}\approx0.3-6\%}$, and ended between
$\mathrm{t_{end\mbox{-}burst}\approx0-330~Myr}$ ago. The CO-detected galaxies
form a higher fraction of mass in the last Gyr
($\mathrm{f_{M_{1Gyr}}=2.6\pm1.8\%}$) compared to the CO-undetected galaxies
($\mathrm{f_{M_{1Gyr}}=0.2\pm0.1\%}$). The galaxies with gas reservoirs have
enhanced late-time star formation, highlighting this as a contributing factor
to the observed heterogeneity in the gas reservoirs in high-redshift quiescent
galaxies. We find that the amount of gas and star formation driven by these
secondary bursts are inconsistent with that expected from dry minor mergers,
and instead are likely driven by recently-accreted gas i.e., gas-rich minor
mergers. This conclusion would not have been made based on
$\mathrm{SFR_{UV+IR}}$ measurements alone, highlighting the power of detailed
SFH modeling in the interpretation of gas reservoirs. Larger samples are needed
to understand the frequency of low-level rejuvenation among quiescent galaxies

highest in energy occupied single-particle states of nucleonic configurations
into negative energy domain. Proton emission from such proton bound rotational
states is suppressed by the disappearance of static pairing correlations at

extension of the nuclear landscape beyond the spin zero proton drip line. In
addition, a new phenomenon of the formation of giant proton halos in rotating

lattices and spinor condensates. We find that the scaling of the many-body
Thouless time $t_{\text{Th}}$ -- the time of the onset of the (RMT) ramp
behavior -- and the increase of the bump amplitude in atom number are
significantly slower in (effectively 0D) chaotic spinor gases than in 1D
optical lattices, demonstrating the role of locality in many-body quantum
chaos. Moreover, $t_{\text{Th}}$ scaling and the bump amplitude are more
sensitive to variations in atom number than the system size regardless of the
hyperfine structure, the symmetry classes, or the choice of the driving
protocol. We obtain scaling functions of SFF which suggest power-law behavior
for the bump regime in quantum chaotic cold-atom systems. Finally, we propose
an interference measurement protocol to probe SFF in the laboratory.

half (16 bits), has the advantage of being much faster. This research focuses
on experimenting with arithmetic at different precision levels for large-scale

arithmetic at lower precision using the MATLAB chop function, and we ran
experiments on applications from image processing and compared their
performance at different precision levels. We concluded that CGLS is a more
stable algorithm, but overflows easily due to the computation of inner
products, while CS is less likely to overflow but it has more erratic
convergence behavior. When the noise level is high, CS outperforms CGLS by
being able to run more iterations before overflow occurs; when the noise level
is close to zero, CS appears to be more susceptible to accumulation of

classify in situ stars as isotropic spheroid, thick-disc, and thin-disc

All simulated galaxies experience an early phase of bursty star formation that
transitions to a late-time steady phase. This transition coincides with the
time that the inner CGM virializes. During the early bursty phase, galaxies
have irregular morphologies and new stars are born on radial orbits; these
stars evolve into an isotropic spheroidal population today. The bulk of
thick-disc stars form at intermediate times, during a clumpy-disc ``spin-up''
phase, slightly later than the peak of spheroid formation. At late times, once
the CGM virializes and star formation ``cools down,"" stars are born on circular
orbits within a narrow plane. Those stars mostly inhabit thin discs today.
Broadly speaking, stars with disc-like or spheroid-like orbits today were born
that way. Mergers onto discs and secular processes do affect kinematics in our
simulations, but play only secondary roles in populating thick-disc and in situ
spheroid populations at z=0. The age distributions of spheroid, thick disc, and
thin disc populations scale self-similarly with the steady-phase transition
time, which suggests that morphological age dating can be linked to the CGM
virialization time in galaxies.

materializing expensive joins (wide-tables). Factorized query execution models
execution as message passing between relations in the join graph and pushes
aggregations through joins to reduce intermediate result sizes. Although this
accelerates query execution, it only optimizes a single wide-table query. In
contrast, wide-table analytics is usually interactive and users want to apply
delta to the initial query structure. For instance, users want to slice, dice
and drill-down dimensions, update part of the tables and join with new tables
for enrichment. Such Wide-table Delta Analytics offers novel work-sharing
opportunities. This work shows that carefully materializing messages during
query execution can accelerate Wide-table Delta Analytics by >10^5x as compared
to factorized execution, and only incurs a constant factor overhead. The key
challenge is that messages are sensitive to the message passing ordering. To
address this challenge, we borrow the concept of calibration in probabilistic
graphical models to materialize sufficient messages to support any ordering. We
manifest these ideas in the novel Calibrated Junction Hypertree (CJT) data
structure, which is fast to build, aggressively re-uses messages to accelerate
future queries, and is incrementally maintainable under updates. We further
show how CJTs benefit applications such as OLAP, query explanation, streaming
data, and data augmentation for ML. Our experiments evaluate three versions of
the CJT that run in a single-threaded custom engine, on cloud DBs, and in
Pandas, and show 30x - 10^5x improvements over state-of-the-art factorized
execution algorithms on the above applications.

to favor two levels of particle density with a preference for one of the two.
It is also speeded up in time, but at a lesser rate than the Kawasaki part.
Under this scaling, the limiting particle density instantly takes either of the

a fundamentally harder, so-called task-agnostic setting where the task

statistically-significant deviation in the value of the loss function that
marks the onset of this new task. At inference, the switching between experts
is governed by the selector network that forwards the test sample to its

domain-expert knowledge to recognize and are time-consuming to collect and
annotate. As a result, these datasets contain few labeled images, and current
machine vision models cannot train intensively on them. Originally introduced
to correct large-language models, model-editing techniques in machine learning
have been shown to improve model performance using only small amounts of data

  Specifically, we apply domain-informed image perturbations to expose the Mask

inconsistency in segmenting fossils with different textures. To address these
shortcomings, we extend an existing model-editing method for correcting
systematic mistakes in image classification to image segmentation with no
additional labeled data needed and show its effectiveness in decreasing
confusion between different kinds of fossils. We also highlight the best
settings for model editing in our situation: making a single edit using all
relevant pixels in one image (vs. using multiple images, multiple edits, or
fewer pixels). Though we focus on fossil segmentation, our approach may be
useful in other similar fine-grain segmentation problems where data is limited.

However, researchers usually feel blank on how to reasonably configure
detection heads combining multi-scale features at different input resolutions.
We find that there are different matching relationships between the object
distribution and the detection head at different input resolutions. Based on
the instructive findings, we propose a lightweight traffic object detection
network based on matching between detection head and object distribution,
termed as MHD-Net. It consists of three main parts. The first is the detection
head and object distribution matching strategy, which guides the rational
configuration of detection head, so as to leverage multi-scale features to
effectively detect objects at vastly different scales. The second is the
cross-scale detection head configuration guideline, which instructs to replace
multiple detection heads with only two detection heads possessing of rich
feature representations to achieve an excellent balance between detection
accuracy, model parameters, FLOPs and detection speed. The third is the
receptive field enlargement method, which combines the dilated convolution
module with shallow features of backbone to further improve the detection
accuracy at the cost of increasing model parameters very slightly. The proposed
model achieves more competitive performance than other models on BDD100K

  Mixture-of-Experts","Accepted at NeurIPS2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we tackle the problem of domain shift. Most existing methods
perform training on multiple source domains using a single model, and the same
trained model is used on all unseen target domains. Such solutions are
sub-optimal as each target domain exhibits its own specialty, which is not
adapted. Furthermore, expecting single-model training to learn extensive
knowledge from multiple source domains is counterintuitive. The model is more
biased toward learning only domain-invariant features and may result in
negative knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel framework for
unsupervised test-time adaptation, which is formulated as a knowledge
distillation process to address domain shift. Specifically, we incorporate
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) as teachers, where each expert is separately trained
on different source domains to maximize their specialty. Given a test-time
target domain, a small set of unlabeled data is sampled to query the knowledge
from MoE. As the source domains are correlated to the target domains, a
transformer-based aggregator then combines the domain knowledge by examining
the interconnection among them. The output is treated as a supervision signal
to adapt a student prediction network toward the target domain. We further
employ meta-learning to enforce the aggregator to distill positive knowledge
and the student network to achieve fast adaptation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art and
validates the effectiveness of each proposed component. Our code is available

making a connection between the EM and the proximal gradient methods in the
context of OMOD. This connection also gives us insight to build new accelerated

theory, and the inexact scheme provides us with the flexibility to implement EM
more efficiently, with convergence guarantee. Furthermore we develop a deep EM
algorithm, wherein we take the structure of our inexact EM algorithm and apply
deep unfolding to train an efficient structured deep net. Simulation results
show that our accelerated exact/inexact EM algorithms run much faster than

characterizes a distribution of diverse adversarial viewpoints under an

extremely vulnerable to the generated adversarial viewpoints, which also
exhibit high cross-model transferability. Based on ViewFool, we introduce
ImageNet-V, a new out-of-distribution dataset for benchmarking viewpoint

an important factor. Snell's law does not hold in materials that partially
absorb light. Hence, the optical path in refraction is calculated from
Maxwell's law. We used it to obtain the deviation angle when a light passes
through a prism made of light absorbing material. As a result, the deviation
angle has a local maximum point. The deviation angle near the local maximum is
sensitive to the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index. The local
maximum deviation angle and its incident angle are used to determine the
complex index of refraction. This measurement has the same advantages as
measuring the minimum deviation angle of a transparent prism. That is, when the
optical bench is slightly rotated and the measurement light is observed, the
moving direction of the light-spot is reversed at the extreme value. The
detection is easy. Then, it is necessary to determine the complex refractive
index from the measured local maximum deviation angle and its incident angle.
These two angles are plotted parametrically by varying the real part of the
refractive index under a fixed imaginary part. The similar curves are drawn
under the fixed real parts. Each curve has a fixed value for the real or
imaginary parts of the refractive index. Drawings of these many curves are made
prior to measurement. Then we select the four curves that are closest to the
local maximum deviation angle and its incident angle. Four fixed values
attached to each of the four curves determine the complex index of refraction.
Various liquids can be put in a prism container made of parallel plate glass
and their local maximum deviation angles are measured. The method in this paper

less accurate predictions for certain demographic groups. To test our
hypothesis, we applied two mobility-based COVID infection prediction models at

a systematic bias in models performance toward certain demographic

the mobility data currently used by many predictive models tends to capture
less information about older, poorer, non-white, and less educated regions,

over the traditional camera in terms of hardware prospects, error accumulation

image signal processing (ISP) pipeline has appeared one after another; however,
there is still a long way to go towards real landing. In this paper, we show
the possibility of learning-based method to achieve real-time high-performance
processing in the ISP pipeline. We propose LW-ISP, a novel architecture
designed to implicitly learn the image mapping from RAW data to RGB image.
Based on U-Net architecture, we propose the fine-grained attention module and a
plug-and-play upsampling block suitable for low-level tasks. In particular, we
design a heterogeneous distillation algorithm to distill the implicit features
and reconstruction information of the clean image, so as to guide the learning
of the student model. Our experiments demonstrate that LW-ISP has achieved a
0.38 dB improvement in PSNR compared to the previous best method, while the
model parameters and calculation have been reduced by 23 times and 81 times.
The inference efficiency has been accelerated by at least 15 times. Without
bells and whistles, LW-ISP has achieved quite competitive results in ISP
subtasks including image denoising and enhancement.

their values. We show this regret bound is sharp in the parametric case, by
giving an example in which it is attained. Using priors calibrated from a

that spontaneous and evoked neurotransmissions using mathematical simulations.
We aimed to address the biophysical constraints that may determine independent
activation on N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA) receptor mediated currents in response
to evoked and spontaneous glutamate molecules releases. In order to identify
the spatial relation between spontaneous and evoked glutamate release, we
considered quantitative factors, such as size of synapses, inhomogeneity of
diffusion mobility, geometry of synaptic cleft, and release rate of
neurotransmitter. Simulation results showed that as a synaptic size is smaller
and if the cleft space is more cohesive in the peripheral area than the centre
area, then there is high possibility of having crosstalk of two signals
released from center and edge. When a synaptic size is larger, the cleft space
is more affinity in the central area than the external area, and if the
geometry of fusion has a narrower space, then those produce more chances of
independence of two modes of currents released from center and edge. The
computed results match well with existing experimental findings and serve as a

neural network (NN) techniques, in particular deep neural networks (DNNs), have
been studied to directly compensate for the impact of hardware impairments.
However, it is difficult to train a DNN with limited pilot signals, hindering
its practical applications. In this work, we investigate how to achieve
efficient Bayesian signal detection in MIMO systems with hardware
imperfections. Characterizing combined hardware imperfections often leads to
complicated signal models, making Bayesian signal detection challenging. To
address this issue, we first train an NN to ""model"" the MIMO system with
hardware imperfections and then perform Bayesian inference based on the trained
NN. Modelling the MIMO system with NN enables the design of NN architectures
based on the signal flow of the MIMO system, minimizing the number of NN layers
and parameters, which is crucial to achieving efficient training with limited
pilot signals. We then represent the trained NN with a factor graph, and design
an efficient message passing based Bayesian signal detector, leveraging the
unitary approximate message passing (UAMP) algorithm. The implementation of a
turbo receiver with the proposed Bayesian detector is also investigated.
Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique delivers
remarkably better performance than state-of-the-art methods.

scope of the fundamental research and practical applications for classical
topologically-protected magnetic textures, and potentially paves the way for
creating new quantum technologies. Undoubtedly, this calls for establishing a
connection between a classical skyrmion and its quantum counterpart: a skyrmion
wave function is an intrinsically more complex object than a non-collinear
configuration of classical spins representing the classical skyrmion. Up to
date, such a quantum-classical relation was only established on the level of
different physical observables, but not for classical and quantum states per
se. In this work, we show that the classical skyrmion spin order can be
reconstructed using only the low-energy part of the spectrum of the
corresponding quantum spin Hamiltonian. This can be done by means of a flexible
symmetry-free numerical realization of Anderson's idea of the towers of states
(TOS) that allows one to study known, as well as unknown, classical spin
configurations with a proper choice of the loss function. We show that the
existence of the TOS in the spectrum of the quantum systems does not guarantee
a priori that the classical skyrmion magnetization profile can be obtained as
an outcome of the actual measurement. This procedure should be complemented by
a proper decoherence mechanism due to the interaction with the environment. The
later selects a specific combination of the TOS eigenfunctions before the
measurement and, thus, ensures the transition from a highly-entangled quantum
skyrmionic state to a classical non-collinear magnetic order that is measured
in real experiments. The results obtained in the context of skyrmions allow us
to take a fresh look at the problem of quantum antiferromagnetism.

student-unfriendliness, we propose a sparse teacher trick under the guidance of
an overall knowledgable score for each teacher parameter. The knowledgable
score is essentially an interpolation of the expressiveness and
student-friendliness scores. The aim is to ensure that the expressive
parameters are retained while the student-unfriendly ones are removed.
Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that the proposed sparse
teachers can be dense with knowledge and lead to students with compelling
performance in comparison with a series of competitive baselines.

and locate each object from a set of point clouds and generate a distinctive
natural language sentence for describing each located object. However, the
existing methods mainly focus on mining inter-object relationship, while
ignoring contextual information, especially the non-object details and
background environment within the point clouds, thus leading to low-quality
descriptions, such as inaccurate relative position information. In this paper,
we make the first attempt to utilize the point clouds clustering features as
the contextual information to supply the non-object details and background
environment of the point clouds and incorporate them into the 3D dense
captioning task. We propose two separate modules, namely the Global Context
Modeling (GCM) and Local Context Modeling (LCM), in a coarse-to-fine manner to
perform the contextual modeling of the point clouds. Specifically, the GCM
module captures the inter-object relationship among all objects with global
contextual information to obtain more complete scene information of the whole
point clouds. The LCM module exploits the influence of the neighboring objects
of the target object and local contextual information to enrich the object
representations. With such global and local contextual modeling strategies, our
proposed model can effectively characterize the object representations and
contextual information and thereby generate comprehensive and detailed
descriptions of the located objects. Extensive experiments on the ScanRefer and
Nr3D datasets demonstrate that our proposed method sets a new record on the 3D
dense captioning task, and verify the effectiveness of our raised contextual

maximizing the Worst-Case Secrecy Rate (WCSR) in a UAV-aided downlink network
where a multi-antenna UAV Base-Station (UAV-BS) serves a group of users in the
presence of an external eavesdropper (Eve). We consider a practical scenario in

consecutive stages. With regard to the SRUS, we study both centralized and
distributed protocols. On the other hand, for jointly optimizing the network
parameter allocation we resort to the Sequential Parametric Convex

compiling a sample of 65 CL-AGNs with good measurements, we reinforce the
previous claim that CL-AGNs tend to be biased against both a high Eddington

AGNs at a special evolutionary stage, such as a transition stage from ``feast''

core of a geometrically finite hyperbolic 3-manifolds $M$ of infinite volume.
In this paper, we focus on the remaining case of geodesic planes outside the
convex core of $M$, giving a complete classification of their closures in $M$.
  In particular, we show that the behavior is different depending on whether
exotic roofs exist or not. Here an exotic roof is a geodesic plane contained in
an end $E$ of $M$, which limits on the convex core boundary $\partial E$, but
cannot be separated from the core by a support plane of $\partial E$.
  A necessary condition for the existence of exotic roofs is the existence of
exotic rays for the bending lamination. Here an exotic ray is a geodesic ray
that has finite intersection number with a measured lamination $\mathcal{L}$
but is not asymptotic to any leaf nor eventually disjoint from $\mathcal{L}$.
We establish that exotic rays exist if and only if $\mathcal{L}$ is not a
multicurve. The proof is constructive, and the ideas involved are important in
the construction of exotic roofs.
  We also show that the existence of geodesic rays satisfying a stronger
condition than being exotic, phrased in terms of only the hyperbolic surface
$\partial E$ and the bending lamination, is sufficient for the existence of
exotic roofs. As a result, we show that geometrically finite ends with exotic
roofs exist in every genus. Moreover, in genus $1$, when the end is homotopic
to a punctured torus, a generic one (in the sense of Baire category) contains
uncountably many exotic roofs.

objectives by carefully designing a single-stage network, which makes it still
challenging to generate a high-fidelity point distribution. Instead, upsampling
point cloud in a coarse-to-fine manner is a decent solution. However, existing
coarse-to-fine upsampling methods require extra training strategies, which are
complicated and time-consuming during the training. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet effective cascaded refinement network, consisting of three
generation stages that have the same network architecture but achieve different
objectives. Specifically, the first two upsampling stages generate the dense
but coarse points progressively, while the last refinement stage further adjust
the coarse points to a better position. To mitigate the learning conflicts
between multiple stages and decrease the difficulty of regressing new points,
we encourage each stage to predict the point offsets with respect to the input
shape. In this manner, the proposed cascaded refinement network can be easily
optimized without extra learning strategies. Moreover, we design a
transformer-based feature extraction module to learn the informative global and
local shape context. In inference phase, we can dynamically adjust the model
efficiency and effectiveness, depending on the available computational
resources. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-scanned datasets

returns for both the training and the test periods for the majority of the
sectors is identified. The sectors that exhibit the maximum cumulative returns

solving time-varying distributed optimization (TVDO). The objective is to
minimize the sum of local time-varying cost functions subject to the possible
time-varying constraints by the coordination of multiple agents in finite time.
We first provide a unified approach for designing finite/fixed-time convergent
algorithms to solve centralized time-varying optimization, where an auxiliary
dynamics is introduced to achieve prescribed performance. Then, two classes of
TVDO are investigated included unconstrained distributed consensus optimization
and distributed optimal resource allocation problems (DORAP) with both
time-varying cost functions and coupled equation constraints. For the previous
one, based on nonsmooth analysis, a continuous-time distributed discontinuous
dynamics with FT convergence is proposed based on an extended zero-gradient-sum
method with a local auxiliary subsystem. Different from the existing methods,
the proposed algorithm does not require the initial state of each agent to be
the optimizer of the local cost function. Moreover, the provided algorithm has
a simpler structure without estimating the global information and can be used
for TVDO with nonidentical Hessians. Then, an FT convergent distributed
dynamics is further obtained for time-varying DORAP by dual transformation.
Particularly, the inverse of Hessians is not required from a dual perspective,
which reduces the computation complexity significantly. Finally, two numerical
examples are conducted to verify the proposed algorithms.

cross-entropy loss, which forces the model outputs to be aligned verbatim with

Latent alignment models relax the explicit alignment by marginalizing out all
monotonic latent alignments with the CTC loss. However, they cannot handle
non-monotonic alignments, which is non-negligible as there is typically global
word reordering in machine translation. In this work, we explore non-monotonic
latent alignments for NAT. We extend the alignment space to non-monotonic
alignments to allow for the global word reordering and further consider all
alignments that overlap with the target sentence. We non-monotonically match
the alignments to the target sentence and train the latent alignment model to
maximize the F1 score of non-monotonic matching. Extensive experiments on major
WMT benchmarks show that our method substantially improves the translation

to do so model such interactions only implicitly, and thus tend to produce
artifacts such as ""ghost motion"" because of the lack of explicit constraints
between the local poses and the global motion. Here, by contrast, we propose to
explicitly model the human-scene contacts. To this end, we introduce
distance-based contact maps that capture the contact relationships between
every joint and every 3D scene point at each time instant. We then develop a
two-stage pipeline that first predicts the future contact maps from the past
ones and the scene point cloud, and then forecasts the future human poses by
conditioning them on the predicted contact maps. During training, we explicitly
encourage consistency between the global motion and the local poses via a prior

is particularly important for many computer vision related tasks since no
explicit graph structure is available for images for most cases. A natural way
to construct a graph among images is to treat each image as a node and assign
pairwise image similarities as weights to corresponding edges. It is well known
that pairwise similarities between images are sensitive to the noise in feature
representations, leading to unreliable graph structures. We address this
problem from the viewpoint of statistical tests. By viewing the feature vector
of each node as an independent sample, the decision of whether creating an edge
between two nodes based on their similarity in feature representation can be
thought as a ${\it single}$ statistical test. To improve the robustness in the
decision of creating an edge, multiple samples are drawn and integrated by
${\it multiple}$ statistical tests to generate a more reliable similarity
measure, consequentially more reliable graph structure. The corresponding
elegant matrix form named $\mathcal{B}\textbf{-Attention}$ is designed for
efficiency. The effectiveness of multiple tests for graph structure learning is

a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic null with the corresponding dome overlying a
filament and a low-lying magnetic flux rope, observed in 304~\AA~ and 131~\AA~

  The simulated dynamics, triggered by the initial Lorentz force, lead to the
bifurcations of the flux rope, which is similar to the observed bifurcation in
the 131 \AA~ brightenings. Additionally, the rope exhibits a rise and
reconnects at the 3D null. These reconnections convert field lines of the rope
into the anchored outer spine of the 3D null -- explaining the occurrence of a

schema evolution can be modeled as data modification operations that change the

support schema almost 'for free' by leveraging the concurrency control

  Connection-based?",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates low-power random access protocols for timely status
update systems with age of information (AoI) requirements. AoI characterizes
information freshness, formally defined as the time elapsed since the
generation of the last successfully received update. Considering an extensive
network, a fundamental problem is how to schedule massive transmitters to
access the wireless channel to achieve low network-wide AoI and high energy
efficiency. In conventional packet-based random access protocols, transmitters
contend for the channel by sending the whole data packet. When the packet
duration is long, the time and transmit power wasted due to packet collisions
is considerable. In contrast, connection-based random access protocols first
establish connections with the receiver before the data packet is transmitted.
Intuitively, from an information freshness perspective, there should be
conditions favoring either side. This paper presents a comparative study of the
average AoI of packet-based and connection-based random access protocols, given
an average transmit power budget. Specifically, we consider slotted Aloha (SA)
and frame slotted Aloha (FSA) as representatives of packet-based random access
and design a request-then-access (RTA) protocol to study the AoI of
connection-based random access. We derive closed-form average AoI and average
transmit power consumption formulas for different protocols. Our analyses
indicate that the use of packet-based or connection-based protocols depends
mainly on the payload size of update packets and the transmit power budget. In
particular, RTA saves power and reduces AoI significantly, especially when the
payload size is large. Overall, our investigation provides insights into the
practical design of random access protocols for low-power timely status update
systems.

sentence representation learning. Although playing essential roles in
contrastive learning, data augmentation methods applied on sentences have not

mechanism as continuous augmentation which outperforms discrete augmentations
such as cropping, word deletion and synonym replacement. To understand the
underlying rationales, we revisit existing approaches and attempt to
hypothesize the desiderata of reasonable data augmentation methods: balance of
semantic consistency and expression diversity. Based on the hypothesis, we
propose three simple yet effective discrete sentence augmentation methods,
i.e., punctuation insertion, affirmative auxiliary and double negation. The
punctuation marks, auxiliaries and negative words act as minimal noises in
lexical level to produce diverse sentence expressions. Unlike traditional
augmentation methods which randomly modify the sentence, our augmentation rules
are well designed for generating semantically consistent and grammatically
correct sentences. We conduct extensive experiments on both English and Chinese
semantic textual similarity datasets. The results show the robustness and
effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Partial AUC (OPAUC) and Two-way Partial AUC (TPAUC), measures the average
performance of a binary classifier within a specific false positive rate and/or
true positive rate interval, which is a widely adopted measure when decision
constraints must be considered. Consequently, PAUC optimization has naturally
attracted increasing attention in the machine learning community within the
last few years. Nonetheless, most of the existing methods could only optimize
PAUC approximately, leading to inevitable biases that are not controllable.
Fortunately, a recent work presents an unbiased formulation of the PAUC
optimization problem via distributional robust optimization. However, it is
based on the pair-wise formulation of AUC, which suffers from the limited
scalability w.r.t. sample size and a slow convergence rate, especially for
TPAUC. To address this issue, we present a simpler reformulation of the problem
in an asymptotically unbiased and instance-wise manner. For both OPAUC and
TPAUC, we come to a nonconvex strongly concave minimax regularized problem of
instance-wise functions. On top of this, we employ an efficient solver enjoys a
linear per-iteration computational complexity w.r.t. the sample size and a
time-complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-1/3})$ to reach a $\epsilon$ stationary point.
Furthermore, we find that the minimax reformulation also facilitates the
theoretical analysis of generalization error as a byproduct. Compared with the
existing results, we present new error bounds that are much easier to prove and
could deal with hypotheses with real-valued outputs. Finally, extensive
experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our

previous visits and current status. Most existing methods usually merely
leverage recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to explore sequential influences for
recommendation. Despite the effectiveness, these methods not only neglect
topological geographical influences among POIs, but also fail to model
high-order sequential substructures. To tackle the above issues, we propose a
Kernel-Based Graph Neural Network (KBGNN) for next POI recommendation, which
combines the characteristics of both geographical and sequential influences in
a collaborative way. KBGNN consists of a geographical module and a sequential
module. On the one hand, we construct a geographical graph and leverage a
message passing neural network to capture the topological geographical
influences. On the other hand, we explore high-order sequential substructures
in the user-aware sequential graph using a graph kernel neural network to
capture user preferences. Finally, a consistency learning framework is
introduced to jointly incorporate geographical and sequential information
extracted from two separate graphs. In this way, the two modules effectively
exchange knowledge to mutually enhance each other. Extensive experiments
conducted on two real-world LBSN datasets demonstrate the superior performance

armed conflict. Advances in automated event extraction have yielded massive
data sets of ""who did what to whom"" micro-records that enable data-driven
approaches to monitoring conflict. The Goldstein scale is a widely-used
expert-based measure that scores events on a conflictual-cooperative scale. It
is based only on the action category (""what"") and disregards the subject
(""who"") and object (""to whom"") of an event, as well as contextual information,
like associated casualty count, that should contribute to the perception of an
event's ""intensity"". This paper takes a latent variable-based approach to
measuring conflict intensity. We introduce a probabilistic generative model
that assumes each observed event is associated with a latent intensity class. A
novel aspect of this model is that it imposes an ordering on the classes, such
that higher-valued classes denote higher levels of intensity. The ordinal
nature of the latent variable is induced from naturally ordered aspects of the
data (e.g., casualty counts) where higher values naturally indicate higher
intensity. We evaluate the proposed model both intrinsically and extrinsically,
showing that it obtains comparatively good held-out predictive performance.

Kaluza-Klein (KK) reductions of the O-plane effective actions on a circle

paper we show that due to the presence of the second fundamental form in the
D-brane couplings at order $\alpha'$ and higher, the T-duality is satisfied
only for a subclass of couplings for arbitrary base space background. They are
$m=0$ couplings where $m$ is the number of $\tilde{B}$-field (without
derivative on it). For $m>0$ couplings, the base space metric must be
block-diagonal and the momentum $U(1)$ vector field must be zero. However, the
derivatives of the metric and the vector field are arbitrary.
  Using the assumption that the effective actions at the critical dimension are
background independent, we then show that the T-duality constraint for the
couplings at order $\alpha'$ and for $m=0$, fixes completely both bulk and
boundary actions. These couplings indicate that the propagators of the massless
open string fields receive $\alpha'$-correction.
  We have also imposed the T-duality constraint on $m=1,2,3,4$ couplings.
Because of the above restriction on the base space background in these cases,
however, the T-duality can only partially fix the couplings for $m>0$. This
study shows that the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) factor appears in both bulk and
boundary actions at order $\alpha'$.

edges of the graph of ants' pathways. Then, each segment, attributed to its own
pheromone profile, may host an ant. So, multiple ants may occupy an edge at the
same time. Thanks to this segment-wise edge formulation, ants have more
selection options in the course of their pathway determination, thereby
increasing the diversity of their colony's emergent behaviors. In light of the
continuous pheromone dynamics of segments, each edge owns a spatio-temporal
piece-wise continuous pheromone profile in which both deposit and evaporation
processes are unified. The passive dynamics of the proposed migration mechanism
is sufficiently rich so that an ant colony can migrate to the vicinity of a new

points with semi-ordered initial states. Different from the case with
homogeneous ordered initial states, in which the order parameter $M$ decays
homogeneously as $M\propto \tau^{-\beta/\nu z}$, here $M$ depends on the
location $x$, showing rich scaling behaviors. Similar to the classical
relaxation dynamics with an initial domain wall in Model A, which describes the
purely dissipative dynamics, here as the imaginary time evolves, the domain
wall expands into an interfacial region with growing size. In the interfacial
region, the local order parameter decays as $M\propto \tau^{-\beta_1/\nu z}$,
with $\beta_1$ being an additional dynamic critical exponent. Far away from the
interfacial region the local order parameter decays as $M\propto
\tau^{-\beta/\nu z}$ in the short-time stage, then crosses over to the scaling
behavior of $M\propto \tau^{-\beta_1/\nu z}$ when the location $x$ is absorbed
in the interfacial region. A full scaling form characterizing these scaling
properties is developed. The quantum Ising model in both one and two dimensions
are taken as examples to verify the scaling theory. In addition, we find that

growing number of entity types over time from a stream of data. However, simply
learning Other-Class in the same way as new entity types amplifies the
catastrophic forgetting and leads to a substantial performance drop. The main
cause behind this is that Other-Class samples usually contain old entity types,
and the old knowledge in these Other-Class samples is not preserved properly.
Thanks to the causal inference, we identify that the forgetting is caused by
the missing causal effect from the old data. To this end, we propose a unified
causal framework to retrieve the causality from both new entity types and
Other-Class. Furthermore, we apply curriculum learning to mitigate the impact
of label noise and introduce a self-adaptive weight for balancing the causal
effects between new entity types and Other-Class. Experimental results on three

introduced the notions of extrinsic conformal Laplacians and extrinsic
$Q$-curvatures. Here we derive explicit formulas for the extrinsic version
${\bf P}_4$ of the Paneitz operator and the corresponding extrinsic
fourth-order $Q$-curvature ${\bf Q}_4$ in general dimensions. This result
involves a series of obvious local conformal invariants of the embedding $M^4
\hookrightarrow X^5$ (defined in terms of the Weyl tensor and the trace-free
second fundamental form) and a non-trivial local conformal invariant
$\mathcal{C}$. In turn, we identify $\mathcal{C}$ as a linear combination of
two local conformal invariants $J_1$ and $J_2$. Moreover, a linear combination
of $J_1$ and $J_2$ can be expressed in terms of obvious local conformal
invariants of the embedding $M \hookrightarrow X$. This finally reduces the
non-trivial part of the structure of ${\bf Q}_4$ to the non-trivial invariant
$J_1$. For closed $M^4 \hookrightarrow {\mathbb R}^5$, we relate the integrals
of $J_i$ to functionals of Guven and Graham-Reichert. Moreover, we establish a
Deser-Schwimmer type decomposition of the Graham-Reichert functional of a

we find one further local conformal invariant $J_3$. Finally, we derive an
explicit formula for the singular Yamabe energy of a closed $M^4

focused on two issues. On the one hand, it has been proven that GNNs are as
powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test (1-WL) in their ability to distinguish
graphs. Moreover, it has been shown that the equivalence enforced by 1-WL
equals unfolding equivalence. On the other hand, GNNs turned out to be
universal approximators on graphs modulo the constraints enforced by
1-WL/unfolding equivalence. However, these results only apply to Static
Undirected Homogeneous Graphs with node attributes. In contrast, real-life
applications often involve a variety of graph properties, such as, e.g.,
dynamics or node and edge attributes. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical
analysis of the expressive power of GNNs for these two graph types that are
particularly of interest. Dynamic graphs are widely used in modern
applications, and its theoretical analysis requires new approaches. The
attributed type acts as a standard form for all graph types since it has been
shown that all graph types can be transformed without loss to Static Undirected
Homogeneous Graphs with attributes on nodes and edges (SAUHG). The study
considers generic GNN models and proposes appropriate 1-WL tests for those
domains. Then, the results on the expressive power of GNNs are extended by
proving that GNNs have the same capability as the 1-WL test in distinguishing
dynamic and attributed graphs, the 1-WL equivalence equals unfolding
equivalence and that GNNs are universal approximators modulo 1-WL/unfolding
equivalence. Moreover, the proof of the approximation capability holds for
SAUHGs, which include most of those used in practical applications, and it is
constructive in nature allowing to deduce hints on the architecture of GNNs

the featureless red spectra indicate a P-type asteroid in the Tholen taxonomy,
though the yet known bulk density did not match very well this classification.
Aim of this work was to derive new estimates for the mass and for the bulk
density for (223) Rosa. The mass of Rosa was derived by analyzing the
gravitational deflection of small `test' asteroids which had a close encounter
with Rosa in the past. To find such events suitable for the mass determination,
an encounter search with about 900,000 asteroids over the time span $1980-2030$
was performed. Three encounters were identified from which two independent mass
estimates for Rosa were derived: $M = (5.32 \pm 2.17) \times 10^{17}$ kg and $M
= (3.15 \pm 1.14) \times 10^{17}$ kg, respectively. The weighted mean is $M =
(3.62 \pm 1.25) \times 10^{17}$ kg. This yields to a bulk density of $\rho =
1.2 \pm 0.5 \mathrm{\,g\,cm^{-3}}$, when adopting an effective diameter of $D =
83 \pm 8$ km. This bulk density estimate is consistent with typical densities
for Tholen taxonomy P-type asteroids.

effect of multimodality for non-autoregressive translation (NAT), which removes
the penalty of word order errors in the standard cross-entropy loss. Starting
from the intuition that reordering generally occurs between phrases, we extend
oaxe by only allowing reordering between ngram phrases and still requiring a
strict match of word order within the phrases. Extensive experiments on NAT
benchmarks across language pairs and data scales demonstrate the effectiveness
and universality of our approach. %Further analyses show that the proposed
ngram-oaxe alleviates the multimodality problem with a better modeling of
phrase translation. Further analyses show that ngram-oaxe indeed improves the
translation of ngram phrases, and produces more fluent translation with a
better modeling of sentence structure.

  gravitational-wave bright sirens detected by future SKA-era pulsar timing
  arrays",,,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have the potential to detect Nanohertz
gravitational waves (GWs) that are usually generated by the individual
inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the galactic centers.
The GW signals as cosmological standard sirens can provide the absolute cosmic
distances, thereby can be used to constrain the cosmological parameters. In
this paper, we analyze the ability of future SKA-era PTAs to detect the
existing SMBHBs candidates assuming the root mean square of timing noise
$\sigma_t=20\ {\rm ns}$, and use the simulated PTA data to constrain the
interacting dark energy (IDE) models with energy transfer rate $Q = \beta
H\rho_c$. We find that, the future SKA-era PTAs will play an important role in
constraining the IDE cosmology. Using only the mock PTA data consisting of 100
pulsars, we obtain $\sigma(H_0)=0.239\ {\rm km} \ {\rm s}^{-1} {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$
and $\sigma(\Omega_m)=0.0103$ in the I$\Lambda$CDM model, which are much better
than the results from the Planck TT, TE, EE+lowE. However, the PTA data cannot
provide a tight constraint on the coupling parameter $\beta$ compared with
Planck, but the data combination of Planck+PTA can provide a rather tight
constraint, i.e., $\sigma(\beta)=0.00232$, since the PTA data could break the
parameter degeneracies inherent in CMB. In the I$w$CDM model, we obtain
$\sigma(\beta)=0.00137$ and $\sigma(w)=0.0492$ from the Planck+PTA data
combination. In addition, we also find that with the increase of the number of
pulsars in PTA, the constraint results from the Planck+PTA will be further
improved to some extent. We show that the observations of Nanohertz GWs with
future SKA-era PTAs will provide a powerful tool for exploring the nature of
dark energy and measuring the coupling between dark energy and dark matter.

learn the rules of 2D-3D projection from spatial and temporal correlation.

recent work [29] considers that there are differences in motion between
different joints and deals with the temporal relationship of each joint
separately. However, we found that different joints show the same movement
trends under some specific actions. Therefore, our proposed Fusionformer method
introduces a self-trajectory module and a mutual-trajectory module based on the
spatio-temporal module .After that, the global spatio-temporal features and
local joint trajectory features are fused through a linear network in a
parallel manner. To eliminate the influence of bad 2D poses on 3D projections,
finally we also introduce a pose refinement network to balance the consistency

In comparison, multi-target smoothing uses all measurements up to current
timestep and recursively propagates the entire history of multi-target state

convergence of discrete Bass models on various networks to their respective
compartmental Bass models, as the population size $M$ becomes infinite. In this
method, the full set of master equations is reduced to a smaller system of
equations, which is closed and exact. The reduced finite system is embedded
into an infinite system, and the convergence of that system to the infinite
limit system is proved using standard ODE estimates. Finally, an ansatz
provides an exact closure of the infinite limit system, which reduces that
system to the compartmental model.
  Using this method, we show that when the network is complete and homogeneous,
the discrete Bass model converges to the original 1969 compartmental Bass
model, at the rate of $1/M$. When the network is circular, however, the
compartmental limit is different, and the rate of convergence is exponential in
$M$. In the case of a heterogeneous network that consists of $K$ homogeneous
groups, the limit is given by a heterogeneous compartmental Bass model, and the
rate of convergence is $1/M$. Using this compartmental model, we show that when
the heterogeneity in the external and internal influence parameters among the

  has been published in ECCV 2022 and it can be find in arXiv:2203.03952",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Transformer models have made tremendous progress in various fields in recent
years. In the field of computer vision, vision transformers (ViTs) also become
strong alternatives to convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), yet they have
not been able to replace ConvNets since both have their own merits. For
instance, ViTs are good at extracting global features with attention mechanisms
while ConvNets are more efficient in modeling local relationships due to their
strong inductive bias. A natural idea that arises is to combine the strengths
of both ConvNets and ViTs to design new structures. In this paper, we propose a
new basic neural network operator named position-aware circular convolution
(ParC) and its accelerated version Fast-ParC. The ParC operator can capture
global features by using a global kernel and circular convolution while keeping
location sensitiveness by employing position embeddings. Our Fast-ParC further
reduces the O(n2) time complexity of ParC to O(n log n) using Fast Fourier
Transform. This acceleration makes it possible to use global convolution in the
early stages of models with large feature maps, yet still maintains the overall
computational cost comparable with using 3x3 or 7x7 kernels. The proposed
operation can be used in a plug-and-play manner to 1) convert ViTs to
pure-ConvNet architecture to enjoy wider hardware support and achieve higher
inference speed; 2) replacing traditional convolutions in the deep stage of
ConvNets to improve accuracy by enlarging the effective receptive field.
Experiment results show that our ParC op can effectively enlarge the receptive
field of traditional ConvNets, and adopting the proposed op benefits both ViTs
and ConvNet models on all three popular vision tasks, image classification,

a pipeline architecture that hides most additional delays caused by the
interleaved parameter loadings alongside layer executions. Our implementation
shows a 96.5% memory reduction with just 14.8% delay overhead on average for

simulated using the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach with gas-particle two-way

combustion and parametric studies are conducted based on a two-dimensional
computational domain. A detonation map of propagation and extinction
corresponding to various particle sizes, concentrations, and curtain
thicknesses is plotted. It is shown that the critical curtain thickness
decreases considerably when the particle concentration is less than the
critical value. The effects of curtain thickness on the trajectories of peak
pressure, shock front speed, and heat release rate are examined. Three
propagation modes of the DW in particle curtain are found: detonation
transmission, partial extinction and detonation reinitiation, and detonation
extinction. The chemical explosive mode analysis confirms that a detonation
re-initiation event is caused by a re-initiation point with high pressure and
explosive propensity, resulting from transverse shock focusing. The influence
of particle dimeter and concentration, and curtain thickness on the DW are also
examined with peak pressure trajectories, shock speed, and interphase exchange
rates of energy and momentum. Furthermore, the evolutions of curtain
morphologies are analyzed by the particle velocity, volume fraction, Stokes
drag and Archimedes force. This analysis confirms the importance of the drag
force in influencing the change of curtain morphologies. Different curtain
evolution regimes are found: quasi-stationary regime, shrinkage regime,
constant-thickness regime, and expansion regime. Finally, the influences of the
curtain thickness on the characteristic time of curtain evolutions are studied.

extracting finer-grained Elementary Discourse Unit (EDU) with little analysis
and justification for the extractive unit selection. Further, the selection
strategy of the fixed top-$k$ salient sentences fits the summarization need
poorly, as the number of salient sentences in different documents varies and
therefore a common or best $k$ does not exist in reality. To fill these gaps,
this paper first conducts the comparison analysis of oracle summaries based on
EDUs and sentences, which provides evidence from both theoretical and
experimental perspectives to justify and quantify that EDUs make summaries with
higher automatic evaluation scores than sentences. Then, considering this merit
of EDUs, this paper further proposes an EDU-level extractive model with Varying

learns to encode and predict probabilities of EDUs in the document, generate
multiple candidate summaries with varying lengths based on various $k$ values,

Finally, EDU-VL is experimented on single and multi-document benchmark datasets

motivation, in this work, we use tools from stochastic geometry to analyze the

Numerical results verify the analysis accuracy and clarify the advantages of

one ECU (system on a chip) and architectures consisting of multiple
communicating ECUs. The single-ECU systems achieve higher reliability, whereas
the multi-ECU systems are more robust against dependent failures, such as
common-cause or cascading failures, due to their increased potential for
diversity redundancy. Yet, it remains not fully understood how different types
of architectures influence the system reliability. The work aims to design
architectures with respect to CPU and sensor number, $M$oo$N$ expression, and
hardware element reliability. The results enable a direct comparison of
different architecture types. We calculate their reliability and quantify the
effort to achieve high safety requirements. Markov processes allow comparing
sensor and CPU architectures by varying the number of components and failure
rates. The objective is to evaluate systems' survival probability and fault
tolerance and design suitable sensor-CPU architectures. The results show that
the system architecture strongly influences the reliability. However, a
suitable system architecture must have a trade-off between reliability and
self-diagnostics that parallel systems without majority redundancies do not
provide.

well-known problem in non-equilibrium physics. These events can have huge
impacts on human societies. New approaches have emerged in the last ten years,

concepts without the need to perform heavy direct ensemble simulations. In
particular, a well-known approach is to derive a minimum action principle and
to find its minimizers.
  The analysis of rare reactive events in non-equilibrium systems without
detailed balance is notoriously difficult either theoretically and
computationally. They are described in the limit of small noise by the
Freidlin-Wentzell action. We propose here a new method which minimizes the
geometrical action instead using neural networks: it is called deep gMAM. It
relies on a natural and simple machine-learning formulation of the classical
gMAM approach. We give a detailed description of the method as well as many

developments, we then introduce the concept of an emergent SU(2) symmetry,
which rotates between the superconducting and charge order parameters. We
describe a solvable model for which this symmetry turns out to be exact and
derive the corresponding effective field theory in terms of a non-linear

the presence of skyrmions inside the vortex core and an elegant account of the
$B$-$T$ phase diagram. Next, we move on to the second concept, which is the one
of an emergent U(1) gauge field in the theory. Within this more general
framework, the pseudogap transition can be viewed as a confining/deconfining
transition. Experimental consequences for a few spectroscopic probes like
inelastic neutron scattering, Raman spectroscopy, phonon line in x-ray
scattering and ARPES measurements are studied. This theory suggests the
presence of incoherent bosons at high temperature in the phase diagram of the
cuprates, which would undergo a jamming transition at optimal doping.
Consequences of the presence of such bosons on the transport properties of

scaling, providing more freedom for formation coordination. We design a
distributed trajectory optimization framework that considers formation
similarity, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic feasibility. The optimization is
decoupled to make large-scale formation flights computationally feasible. To
improve the elasticity of formation navigation in highly constrained scenes, we
present a swarm reorganization method which adaptively adjusts the formation
parameters and task assignments by generating local navigation goals. A novel
swarm agreement strategy called global-remap-local-replan and a formation-level
path planner is proposed in this work to coordinate the swarm global planning

mechanism based on cooperative game theory. All prosumers first submit the
parameters associated with both electricity and data to the market operator.
The operator utilizes the public and prosumers' private data to forecast the
distributed renewable generators (DRGs) and quantify the improvement driven by
prosumers' private data in terms of reduced uncertainty set. Then, the operator
maximizes the grand coalition's total payoff considering the uncertain
generation of DRGs and imputes the payoff to each prosumer based on their
contribution to electricity and data sharing. The mathematical formulation of
the grand coalition is developed and converted into a second order cone
programming problem by using an affinepolicy based robust approach. The
stability of such a grand coalition is mathematically proved, i.e., all
prosumers are willing to cooperate. Furthermore, to address the scalability
challenge of existing payoff imputation methods in the cooperative game, a two
stage optimization based approach is proposed, which is converted into a mixed
integer second order cone programming and solved by the Benders decomposition.
Case studies illustrate all prosumers are motivated to trade electricity and

how robust FL-based NIDSs are against existing privacy attacks under existing

reconstruction attacks, and (2) evasion rate against NIDSs using Generative
Adversarial Network-based adversarial attack with the reconstructed benign

protection that the corresponding adversarial traffic can even evade the SOTA
NIDS Kitsune. To defend against such attacks and build a more robust FL-based

minimizing the gradient distance and strong privacy protection by maximizing
the input distance. We experimentally evaluate four existing defenses on four

the vicinity of the horizon, we calculate the effective path corresponding to
its Schrodinger version of Hamiltonian through the path integral approach. The
latter result appears to be complex in nature and carries the information of
escaping the probability of the particle through the horizon. In both ways, we
identify the correct expression of Hawking temperature. Moreover, here we
successfully extend the complex path approach to a more general black hole like
Kerr spacetime. We feel that such a complex path is an outcome of the nature of
near horizon instability provided by the horizon and, therefore, once again
bolstered the fact that the thermalization mechanism of the horizon may be

environments are specified as the parallel composition of state machines and
valid strategies are required to be ''non-blocking'' (i.e., always enabling the
environment to reach certain marked states) in addition to safe (i.e., keep the

techniques were proposed to avoid the exploration of the entire -and

permissiveness, to either find a strategy or conclude that there is none. The
incremental exploration of the plant is currently guided by a

learn heuristics on small versions of a problem that generalize to the larger

environmental factors will affect its incidence probability. Breast cancer
metastasis is one of the main cause of breast cancer related deaths reported by
the American Cancer Society (ACS). Method: the iMedBot is a web application
that we developed using the python Flask web framework and deployed on Amazon
Web Services. It contains a frontend and a backend. The backend is supported by
a python program we developed using the python Keras and scikit-learn packages,
which can be used to learn deep feedforward neural network (DFNN) models.
Result: the iMedBot can provide two main services: 1. it can predict 5-, 10-,
or 15-year breast cancer metastasis based on a set of clinical information
provided by a user. The prediction is done by using a set of DFNN models that
were pretrained, and 2. It can train DFNN models for a user using user-provided
dataset. The model trained will be evaluated using AUC and both the AUC value
and the AUC ROC curve will be provided. Conclusion: The iMedBot web application
provides a user-friendly interface for user-agent interaction in conducting
personalized prediction and model training. It is an initial attempt to convert
results of deep learning research into an online tool that may stir further
research interests in this direction. Keywords: Deep learning, Breast Cancer,

  inflammation","40 pages, 12 figures",,,,"q-bio.TO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This study develops a unified model predicting the whole-body response to
endotoxin. We simulate dynamics using differential equations examining the
response to a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. The model tracks pro- and
anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-$\alpha$, IL-6, IL-10), concentrations of
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and
cortisol in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Daily hormonal
variations are integrated into the model by including circadian oscillations
when tracking CRH. Additionally, the model tracks heart rate, blood pressure,
body temperature, and pain perception. Studied quantities function on
timescales ranging from minutes to days. To understand how endotoxin impacts
the body over this vast span of timescales, we examine the response to
variations in LPS administration methods (single dose, repeated dose, and
continuous dose) as well as the timing of the administration and the amount of
endotoxin released into the system. We calibrate the model to literature data
for a 2 ng/kg LPS bolus injection. Results show that LPS administration during
early morning or late evening generates a more pronounced hormonal response.
Most of the LPS effects are eliminated from the body 24 hours after
administration, the main impact of inflammation remains in the system for 48
hours, and repeated dose simulations show that residual effects remain more
than 10 days after the initial injection. We also show that if the LPS
administration method or total dosage is increased, the system response is
amplified, posing a greater risk of hypotension and pyrexia.

  Convolutional Network",,,,,"q-bio.NC cs.NE eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Brain decoding, aiming to identify the brain states using neural activity, is
important for cognitive neuroscience and neural engineering. However, existing
machine learning methods for fMRI-based brain decoding either suffer from low
classification performance or poor explainability. Here, we address this issue
by proposing a biologically inspired architecture, Spatial Temporal-pyramid
Graph Convolutional Network (STpGCN), to capture the spatial-temporal graph
representation of functional brain activities. By designing multi-scale
spatial-temporal pathways and bottom-up pathways that mimic the information
process and temporal integration in the brain, STpGCN is capable of explicitly
utilizing the multi-scale temporal dependency of brain activities via graph,
thereby achieving high brain decoding performance. Additionally, we propose a
sensitivity analysis method called BrainNetX to better explain the decoding
results by automatically annotating task-related brain regions from the
brain-network standpoint. We conduct extensive experiments on fMRI data under
23 cognitive tasks from Human Connectome Project (HCP) S1200. The results show
that STpGCN significantly improves brain decoding performance compared to
competing baseline models; BrainNetX successfully annotates task-relevant brain
regions. Post hoc analysis based on these regions further validates that the
hierarchical structure in STpGCN significantly contributes to the
explainability, robustness and generalization of the model. Our methods not
only provide insights into information representation in the brain under
multiple cognitive tasks but also indicate a bright future for fMRI-based brain
decoding.

destroyed by erosion, earthquakes, looting or even used as materials in newer
construction. To make things worse, among the small fraction of mosaics that we
have been able to recover, many are damaged or incomplete. Therefore,
restoration and reconstruction of mosaics play a fundamental role to preserve
cultural heritage and to understand the role of mosaics in ancient cultures.
This reconstruction has traditionally been done manually and more recently
using computer graphics programs but always by humans. In the last years,
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made impressive progress in the generation of
images from text descriptions and reference images. State of the art AI tools
such as DALL-E2 can generate high quality images from text prompts and can take
a reference image to guide the process. In august 2022, DALL-E2 launched a new
feature called outpainting that takes as input an incomplete image and a text
prompt and then generates a complete image filling the missing parts. In this
paper, we explore whether this innovative technology can be used to reconstruct
mosaics with missing parts. Hence a set of ancient mosaics have been used and
reconstructed using DALL-E2; results are promising showing that AI is able to
interpret the key features of the mosaics and is able to produce
reconstructions that capture the essence of the scene. However, in some cases
AI fails to reproduce some details, geometric forms or introduces elements that
are not consistent with the rest of the mosaic. This suggests that as AI image
generation technology matures in the next few years, it could be a valuable
tool for mosaic reconstruction going forward.

key/value outer product-based learning rules for sequentially generating a
weight matrix (WM) of a neural net (NN) by another NN or itself. However, the
weight generation steps are typically not visually interpretable by humans,
because the contents stored in the WM of an NN are not. Here we apply the same
principle to generate natural images. The resulting fast weight painters (FPAs)
learn to execute sequences of delta learning rules to sequentially generate
images as sums of outer products of self-invented keys and values, one rank at
a time, as if each image was a WM of an NN. We train our FPAs in the generative
adversarial networks framework, and evaluate on various image datasets. We show
how these generic learning rules can generate images with respectable visual
quality without any explicit inductive bias for images. While the performance
largely lags behind the one of specialised state-of-the-art image generators,
our approach allows for visualising how synaptic learning rules iteratively
produce complex connection patterns, yielding human-interpretable meaningful
images. Finally, we also show that an additional convolutional U-Net (now
popular in diffusion models) at the output of an FPA can learn one-step
""denoising"" of FPA-generated images to enhance their quality. Our code is

content from marginalized groups. In the context of marginal abuse modeling on
Twitter, such disproportionate penalization poses the risk of reduced
visibility, where marginalized communities lose the opportunity to voice their
opinion on the platform. Current approaches to algorithmic harm mitigation, and
bias detection for NLP models are often very ad hoc and subject to human bias.
We make two main contributions in this paper. First, we design a novel
methodology, which provides a principled approach to detecting and measuring
the severity of potential harms associated with a text-based model. Second, we
apply our methodology to audit Twitter's English marginal abuse model, which is
used for removing amplification eligibility of marginally abusive content.
Without utilizing demographic labels or dialect classifiers, we are still able
to detect and measure the severity of issues related to the over-penalization
of the speech of marginalized communities, such as the use of reclaimed speech,
counterspeech, and identity related terms. In order to mitigate the associated
harms, we experiment with adding additional true negative examples and find
that doing so provides improvements to our fairness metrics without large
degradations in model performance.
