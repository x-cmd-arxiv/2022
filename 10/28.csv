self-attention and convolution layers into the non-isomorphic architecture.
However, one potential drawback of these approaches is that they failed to
provide an intuitive explanation of why this hybrid combination manner is
beneficial, making it difficult for subsequent work to make improvements on top
of them. To address this issue, we first analyze the differences between the
weight allocation mechanisms of the self-attention and convolution. Based on
this analysis, we propose to construct a parallel non-isomorphic block that
takes the advantages of self-attention and convolution with simple
parallelization. We name the resulting U-shape segmentation model as UNet-2022.
In experiments, UNet-2022 obviously outperforms its counterparts in a range
segmentation tasks, including abdominal multi-organ segmentation, automatic
cardiac diagnosis, neural structures segmentation, and skin lesion
segmentation, sometimes surpassing the best performing baseline by 4%.
Specifically, UNet-2022 surpasses nnUNet, the most recognized segmentation
model at present, by large margins. These phenomena indicate the potential of
UNet-2022 to become the model of choice for medical image segmentation.

patterns in networked data. Based on matrix multiplications, convolutions incur
in high computational costs leading to scalability limitations in practice. To
overcome these limitations, proposed methods rely on training GNNs in smaller
number of nodes, and then transferring the GNN to larger graphs. Even though
these methods are able to bound the difference between the output of the GNN
with different number of nodes, they do not provide guarantees against the
optimal GNN on the very large graph. In this paper, we propose to learn GNNs on
very large graphs by leveraging the limit object of a sequence of growing
graphs, the graphon. We propose to grow the size of the graph as we train, and
we show that our proposed methodology -- learning by transference -- converges
to a neighborhood of a first order stationary point on the graphon data. A

Recently, many promising works projected entities and queries into a geometric

which generates overlapped embeddings and leads to obtaining ambiguous answers.
An additional limitation is that the union operator is non-closure, which
undermines the model to handle a series of union operators. To address these

Embeddings (GammaE), for encoding entities and queries to answer different
types of FOL queries on KGs. We utilize the linear property and strong boundary
support of the Gamma distribution to capture more features of entities and
queries, which dramatically reduces model uncertainty. Furthermore, GammaE
implements the Gamma mixture method to design the closed union operator. The
performance of GammaE is validated on three large logical query datasets.

asymptotically $AdS_2$ spacetimes dual to the low energy sector of the SYK
model. To describe evaporation, the SYK model is coupled to a bath comprising
of $N_f$ free scalar fields $\Phi_i$. We consider couplings of the form
$O_{SYK}(t) \Phi_i(0,t)$ where $O_{SYK}$ involves the Kourkoulou-Maldacena
operator $i J/N \sum_{k=1}^{N/2} s'_k \psi_{2k-1}(t) \psi_{2k}(t)$ specified by
a spin vector $s'$, or products of such operators. We discuss the time
evolution of a product of (i) a pure state of the SYK, namely a BH microstate
characterized by a spin vector $s$ and an effective BH temperature $T_{BH}$ and
(ii) a Calabrese-Cardy state of the bath characterized by an effective
temperature $T_{bath}$. We take $T_{bath}\ll T_{BH}$, and $T_{BH}$ much lower
than the UV scale $J$ of the SYK model, allowing a description in terms of the
time reparameterization mode. Tracing over the bath leads to a Feynman-Vernon
type effective action for the SYK model, which we study in the large $N$, low
energy limit. The leading large $N$ behaviour of the time reparameterization
mode is found, as well as the $O(1/\sqrt N)$ fluctuations. The latter are
characterized by a non-Markovian non-linear stochastic differential equation
with non-local Gaussian noise. At large times we find two classes of solutions
(a) and (b) which asymptotically approach, respectively, a BH at a lower
temperature, and a horizonless geometry; we identify the processes in (a) and
(b) with partial and complete BH evaporation. Importantly, the asymptotic
solution in both cases involves the scalar product of the spin vectors $s.s'$,
which carries some information about the initial state. We show how, by
repeating the dynamical process $O(N^2)$ times with different choices of the
spin vector $s'$, one can in principle have a reconstruction of the initial BH
microstate.

observers at different longitudinal locations. We find that the radial,
longitudinal and latitudinal injection functions play a relatively minor role
in shaping the SEP intensity profiles. The dependence of profiles on the value
of the scattering mean free path is also weak, unlike what is found from 1D
focussed transport models. Spatial factors, such as the time of
observer-shock-connection/disconnection and time of shock passage have a much
stronger influence on SEP intensities and anisotropies. Persistent anisotropies
until shock passage are seen in our simulations. Comparing instantaneous and
shock-like injections, we find that the link between duration of injection and
of the SEP event is very weak, unlike what is commonly assumed.

variable selection and shrinkage of regression estimates. When more than the

over the popular lasso. Nevertheless, NNG has received little attention. The
original NNG relies on least-squares (OLS) estimates, which are highly variable
in data with a high degree of multicollinearity (HDM) and do not exist in
high-dimensional data (HDD). This might be the reason that NNG is not used in
such data. Alternative initial estimates have been proposed but hardly used in
practice. Analyzing three structurally different data sets, we demonstrated
that NNG can also be applied in HDM and HDD and compared its performance with
the lasso, adaptive lasso, relaxed lasso, and best subset selection in terms of
variables selected, regression estimates, and prediction. Replacing OLS by
ridge initial estimates in HDM and lasso initial estimates in HDD helped NNG
select simpler models than competing approaches without much increase in
prediction errors. Simpler models are easier to interpret, an important issue
for descriptive modelling. Based on the limited experience from three datasets,
we assume that the NNG can be a suitable alternative to the lasso and its
extensions. Neutral comparison simulation studies are needed to better
understand the properties of variable selection methods, compare them and
derive guidance for practice.

real-world environment. To achieve our results, we design a new algorithm for
infinite-horizon average-cost LQGs and establish a regret bound that depends on
the intrinsic complexity of the model class. Our algorithm crucially relies on
a novel history clipping scheme, which might be of independent interest.

by the von Neumann entropies of portions of those boundary states. This work
investigates to what extent the geometries can be reconstructed from the
entropies in polynomial time. Bouland, Fefferman, and Vazirani (2019) argued
that the AdS/CFT map can be exponentially complex if one wants to reconstruct
regions such as the interiors of black holes. Our main result provides a sort
of converse: we show that, in the special case of a single 1D boundary, if the
input data consists of a list of entropies of contiguous boundary regions, and
if the entropies satisfy a single inequality called Strong Subadditivity, then
we can construct a graph model for the bulk in linear time. Moreover, the bulk
graph is planar, it has $O(N^2)$ vertices (the information-theoretic minimum),
and it's ``universal,'' with only the edge weights depending on the specific
entropies in question. From a combinatorial perspective, our problem boils down
to an ``inverse'' of the famous min-cut problem: rather than being given a
graph and asked to find a min-cut, here we're given the values of min-cuts
separating various sets of vertices, and need to find a weighted undirected
graph consistent with those values. Our solution to this problem relies on the
notion of a ``bulkless'' graph, which might be of independent interest for
AdS/CFT. We also make initial progress on the case of multiple 1D boundaries --
where the boundaries could be connected via wormholes -- including an upper
bound of $O(N^4)$ vertices whenever a planar bulk graph exists (thus putting
the problem into the complexity class $\mathsf{NP}$).

example of so-called quantum Hilbert space fragmentation, that is manifested in
disconnected sectors in the Hilbert space that are not apparent in the
computational basis. Quantum Hilbert space fragmentation leads to an
exponential in system size number of eigenstates with exactly zero entanglement
entropy across several bipartite cuts. These eigenstates can be probed
dynamically using quenches from simple initial product states. In addition, we
study the particle spreading under unitary dynamics launched from the domain
wall state, and find faster than diffusive dynamics at high particle densities,
that crosses over into logarithmically slow relaxation at smaller densities.
Using a classically simulable cellular automaton, we reproduce the logarithmic
dynamics observed in the quantum case. Our work suggests that particle

method) mean value estimation of observables is a fundamental task in various
quantum technologies; in particular, it is an essential subroutine in quantum
computing algorithms. Notably, the quantum estimation theory identifies the
ultimate precision of such estimator, which is referred to as the quantum
Cram\'{e}r-Rao (QCR) lower bound or equivalently the inverse of the quantum
Fisher information. Because the estimation precision directly determines the
performance of those quantum technological systems, it is highly demanded to
develop a generic and practically implementable estimation method that achieves
the QCR bound. Under imperfect conditions, however, such ultimate estimator has
not been developed. This paper proposes a quantum-enhanced mean value
estimation method in a depolarizing noisy environment that asymptotically
achieves the QCR bound exponentially fast with respect to the number of qubits.
The method employs a maximum likelihood estimator consisting of the amplitude
amplification and an implementable measurement, which are adaptively optimized
to achieve the QCR bound. We provide a rigorous analysis for the statistical
properties of the proposed adaptive estimator such as consistency and
asymptotic normality. Furthermore, several numerical simulations are provided
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, particularly showing that the
estimator needs only a modest number of measurements to almost saturate the QCR

years. Probabilistic Data Structures (PDS) are efficient alternatives to
deterministic data structures suitable for large data processing and streaming
applications. They are mainly used for approximate membership queries,
frequency count, cardinality estimation and similarity research. Finding the
number of distinct elements in a large dataset or in streaming data is an
active research area. In this work, we show that usual methods based on Bloom
filters for this kind of cardinality estimation are relatively accurate on
average but have a high variance. Therefore, reducing this variance is
interesting to obtain accurate statistics. We propose a probabilistic approach
to estimate more accurately the cardinality of a Bloom filter based on its
parameters, i.e., number of hash functions $k$, size $m$, and a counter $s$
which is incremented whenever an element is not in the filter (i.e., when the
result of the membership query for this element is negative). The value of the
counter can never be larger than the exact cardinality due to the Bloom
filter's nature, but hash collisions can cause it to underestimate it. This
creates a counting error that we estimate accurately, in-stream, along with its
standard deviation. We also discuss a way to optimize the parameters of a Bloom
filter based on its counting error. We evaluate our approach with synthetic
data created from an analysis of a real mobility dataset provided by a mobile
network operator in the form of displacement matrices computed from mobile
phone records. The approach proposed here performs at least as well on average

propulsion force in the longitudinal direction, decoupling the translational
dynamics and the rotational dynamics on the longitudinal plane. A high-level
impedance control law is proposed to drive the vehicle for trajectory tracking
and interaction with the environments. In addition, a vision-based real-time
target identification and tracking method integrating a YOLO v3 real-time
object detector with feature tracking, and morphological operations is proposed
to be implemented onboard the vehicle with support of model compression
techniques to eliminate latency caused by video wireless transmission and heavy

the lone irreducible derivative (LID) and bundled irreducible derivative (BID)
approaches to computing phonons via finite displacements, where the former
optimizes precision via energy derivatives and the latter provides the most
efficient algorithm using force derivatives. A condition number optimized (CNO)
basis for BID is derived which guarantees the minimum amplification of error.
Additionally, a hybrid LID-BID approach is formulated, where select irreducible
derivatives computed using LID replace BID results. We illustrate our approach
on two prototypical systems with sensitive phonons: the shape memory alloy AuZn
and metallic lithium. Comparing our resulting phonons in the aforementioned
crystals to calculations in the literature reveals nontrivial inaccuracies. Our
approaches can be fully automated, making them well suited for both niche

discover profitable or useful sequential patterns in a large number of
sequences. However, simply being aware of utility-eligible patterns is
insufficient for making predictions. To compensate for this deficiency,
high-utility sequential rule mining (HUSRM) is designed to explore the
confidence or probability of predicting the occurrence of consequence
sequential patterns based on the appearance of premise sequential patterns. It
has numerous applications, such as product recommendation and weather
prediction. However, the existing algorithm, known as HUSRM, is limited to
extracting all eligible rules while neglecting the correlation between the
generated sequential rules. To address this issue, we propose a novel algorithm
called correlated high-utility sequential rule miner (CoUSR) to integrate the
concept of correlation into HUSRM. The proposed algorithm requires not only
that each rule be correlated but also that the patterns in the antecedent and
consequent of the high-utility sequential rule be correlated. The algorithm
adopts a utility-list structure to avoid multiple database scans. Additionally,
several pruning strategies are used to improve the algorithm's efficiency and
performance. Based on several real-world datasets, subsequent experiments
demonstrated that CoUSR is effective and efficient in terms of operation time

The process of discovering interesting sounds is often serendipitous and
impossible to replicate. For this reason, many musicians in electronic genres
record audio output at all times while they work in the studio. Subsequently,
it is difficult for artists to rediscover audio segments that might be suitable
for use in their compositions from thousands of hours of recordings. In this
paper, we describe LyricJam Sonic -- a novel creative tool for musicians to
rediscover their previous recordings, re-contextualize them with other
recordings, and create original live music compositions in real-time. A
bi-modal AI-driven approach uses generated lyric lines to find matching audio
clips from the artist's past studio recordings, and uses them to generate new
lyric lines, which in turn are used to find other clips, thus creating a
continuous and evolving stream of music and lyrics. The intent is to keep the
artists in a state of creative flow conducive to music creation rather than
taking them into an analytical/critical state of deliberately searching for
past audio segments. The system can run in either a fully autonomous mode
without user input, or in a live performance mode, where the artist plays live
music, while the system ""listens"" and creates a continuous stream of music and

annihilation in the hadronic phase. By implementing the $B\bar{B}

different centralities, which decreases with increasing charged multiplicity
and yields $T_{\rm ann} = 132 \pm 5$ MeV in 0-5% most central collisions. This
value is considerably below the hadronization temperature of $T_{\rm had} \sim
160$ MeV but above the thermal (kinetic) freeze-out temperature of $T_{\rm kin}
\sim 100$ MeV. Baryon annihilation reactions thus remain relevant in the
initial stage of the hadronic phase but freeze out before (pseudo-)elastic
hadronic scatterings. One experimentally testable consequence of this picture
is a suppression of various light nuclei to proton ratios in central collisions
of heavy ions.

Maxwell and Gibbs construction. We systematically study the gravitational mass,
the radius, and the tidal deformability, and we compare them with the
predictions of the recent observation by LIGO/VIRGO collaboration, the GW170817
event, along with the mass and radius limits, suggesting possible robust
constraints. Moreover, we extent the study in order to include rotation effects
on the twin stars configurations. The recent discovery of the fast rotating

to explore the possibility that the existence of such a massive object would
rule out the existence of twin stars. Finally, we discuss the constraints on

modeling and validating these statistics often have sizes that are much smaller

compare the covariance measured using simulation boxes containing super-sample

find that while the power spectrum, bispectrum and halo mass function show
significant scale- or mass-dependent SSC, the void size function shows
relatively small SSC. We also find significant SSC contributions to the

positions. In addition to positions, future surveys will provide measurements
of galaxies' peculiar velocities through the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich

study this improvement as a function of shot noise, velocity measurement noise,

and advances in computer vision and visual scene understanding. Prior work has
investigated various problems such as vision-aided beam, blockage, and handoff
prediction in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems and vision aided covariance
prediction in massive MIMO systems. This prior work, however, has focused on
scenarios with a single object (user) moving in front of the camera. To enable
vision-aided wireless communication in practice, however, it is important for
these systems to be able to operate in crowded scenarios with multiple objects
in the visual scene. In this paper, we define the user identification task as
the key enabler for realistic vision-aided wireless communication systems that
can operate in crowded scenarios and support multi-user applications. The
objective of the user identification task is to identify the target
communication user from the other candidate objects (distractors) in the visual
scene. We develop machine learning models that process either one frame or a
sequence of frames of visual and wireless data to efficiently identify the
target user in the visual/communication environment. Using the large-scale
multi-modal sense and communication dataset, DeepSense 6G, which is based on
real-world measurements, we show that the developed approaches can successfully
identify the target users with more than 97% accuracy ...

Inequalities (VIs) with equality and inequality constraints through a

ACVI is applicable when we can compute analytic solutions of its subproblems;
thus, the general case remains an open problem. In this paper, we adopt a
warm-starting technique where we solve the subproblems approximately at each
iteration and initialize the variables with the approximate solution found at
the previous iteration. We prove its convergence and show that the gap function
of the last iterate of this inexact-ACVI method decreases at a rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}})$ when the operator is $L$-Lipschitz and
monotone, provided that the errors decrease at appropriate rates.
Interestingly, we show that often in numerical experiments, this technique
converges faster than its exact counterpart. Furthermore, for the cases when
the inequality constraints are simple, we propose a variant of ACVI named
P-ACVI and prove its convergence for the same setting. We further demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed methods through numerous experiments. We also
relax the assumptions in Yang et al., yielding, to our knowledge, the first
convergence result that does not rely on the assumption that the operator is

builds up near the defect core, which is more prominent for slow ramps. We

halos and clusters). The fate of these clouds (as well as many of their
observable properties) is dictated by the competition between turbulence and
radiative cooling; however, turbulence in these multiphase flows remains poorly
understood. We have investigated the emergent turbulence arising in the
interaction between clouds and supersonic winds in hydrodynamic ENZO-E
simulations. In order to obtain robust results, we employed multiple metrics to
characterize the turbulent velocity, $v_{\rm turb}$. We find four primary
results, when cooling is sufficient for cloud survival. First, $v_{\rm turb}$
manifests clear temperature dependence. Initially, $v_{\rm turb}$ roughly
matches the scaling of sound speed on temperature. In gas hotter than the
temperature where cooling peaks, this dependence weakens with time until
$v_{\rm turb}$ is constant. Second, the relative velocity between the cloud and
wind initially drives rapid growth of $v_{\rm turb}$. As it drops (from
entrainment), $v_{\rm turb}$ starts to decay before it stabilizes at roughly
half its maximum. At late times cooling flows appear to support turbulence.
Third, the magnitude of $v_{\rm turb}$ scales with the ratio between the hot
phase sound crossing time and the minimum cooling time. Finally, we find
tentative evidence for a length-scale associated with resolving turbulence.
Under-resolving this scale may cause violent shattering and affect the cloud's
large-scale morphological properties.

These ANTs are characterized by hot blackbody-like UV/optical spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) and smooth photometric evolution, often with hard
powerlaw-like X-ray emission. ANTs are likely exotic TDEs or smooth flares
originating in otherwise narrow-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While their
emission in the UV/optical and X-ray has been relatively well-explored, their
infrared (IR) emission has not been studied in detail. Here we use the NEOWISE
mission and its low-cadence mapping of the entire sky to study mid-infrared
dust reprocessing echoes of ANTs. We study 19 ANTs, finding significant MIR
flares in 18 objects for which we can estimate an IR luminosity and temperature
evolution. The dust reprocessing echoes show a wide range in IR luminosities
($\sim 10^{42} - 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) with blackbody temperatures largely
consistent with sublimation temperature of graphite grains. Excluding the two
sources possibly associated with luminous supernovae (ASASSN-15lh and
ASASSN-17jz), the dust covering fractions (f$_c$) for detected IR flares lie
between 0.05 and 0.91, with a mean of f$_c$ = 0.29 for all ANTs (including
limits) and f$_c$ = $0.38 \pm 0.04$ for detections. These covering fractions
are much higher than optically-selected TDEs and similar to AGNs. We interpret
the high covering fractions in ANT host galaxies as evidence for the presence

on classification performance using simulated multi-band light curves. First,
we simulate SNe with an LSST baseline cadence, a non-rolling cadence, and a
presto-color cadence which observes each sky location three times per night
instead of twice. Each simulated dataset includes a spectroscopically-confirmed
training set, which we augment to be representative of the test set as part of
the classification pipeline. Then, we use the photometric transient
classification library snmachine to build classifiers. We find that the active
region of the rolling cadence used in the baseline observing strategy yields a
25% improvement in classification performance relative to the background
region. This improvement in performance in the actively-rolling region is also
associated with an increase of up to a factor of 2.7 in the number of
cosmologically-useful Type Ia supernovae relative to the background region.
However, adding a third visit per night as implemented in presto-color degrades
classification performance due to more irregularly sampled light curves.
Overall, our results establish desiderata on the observing cadence related to
classification of full SNe light curves, which in turn impacts photometric SNe

transition from the giant vortex to the Regge regime is accompanied by the
scaling dimension turning from being larger than to being smaller than the mean

Submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stad023",,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The merger of two neutron stars (NSs) produces the emission of gravitational
waves, the formation of a compact object surrounded by a dense and magnetized
environment, and the launching of a collimated and relativistic jet, which will
eventually produce a short gamma-ray burst (SGRB). The interaction of the jet
with the environment has been shown to play a major role in shaping the
structure of the outflow that eventually powers the gamma-ray emission. In this
paper, we present a set of 2.5 dimensional RMHD simulations that follow the
evolution of a relativistic non-magnetized jet through a medium with different
magnetization levels, as produced after the merger of two NSs. We find that the
predominant consequence of a magnetized ambient medium is that of suppressing
instabilities within the jet, and preventing the formation of a series of
collimation shocks. One implication of this is that internal shocks lose
efficiency, causing bursts with low-luminosity prompt emission. On the other
hand, the jet-head velocity and the induced magnetization within the jet are
fairly independent from the magnetization of the ambient medium. Future
numerical studies with a larger domain are necessary to obtain light curves and
spectra in order to better understand the role of magnetized media.

algorithms for models trained from scratch. Despite their encouraging
performance on contrived benchmarks, these algorithms show dramatic performance
drops in real-world scenarios. Therefore, this paper advocates the systematic
introduction of pre-training to CL, which is a general recipe for transferring
knowledge to downstream tasks but is substantially missing in the CL community.
Our investigation reveals the multifaceted complexity of exploiting pre-trained
models for CL, along three different axes, pre-trained models, CL algorithms,
and CL scenarios. Perhaps most intriguingly, improvements in CL algorithms from
pre-training are very inconsistent an underperforming algorithm could become
competitive and even state-of-the-art when all algorithms start from a
pre-trained model. This indicates that the current paradigm, where all CL
methods are compared in from-scratch training, is not well reflective of the
true CL objective and desired progress. In addition, we make several other
important observations, including that CL algorithms that exert less
regularization benefit more from a pre-trained model; and that a stronger
pre-trained model such as CLIP does not guarantee a better improvement. Based
on these findings, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline that employs
minimum regularization and leverages the more beneficial pre-trained model,
coupled with a two-stage training pipeline. We recommend including this strong
baseline in the future development of CL algorithms, due to its demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance.

$F(\varphi)=\delta(1-\lambda\cos\varphi)$, to illustrate possibilities of the
model. This model paves the way to investigate complex distortions of the
magnetic structures in the solar wind. Future investigations will in-depth
explore these distortions by analyzing specific events, the implications in the
physical quantities, such as magnetic fluxes, heliciy or energy, and evaluating
the force balance with the ambient solar wind that allows such distortions.

apply neutron scattering to investigate the dynamic magnetism of this phase in
a large single crystal which displays a low temperature spin glass transition
(T$_{g} \sim$ 15 K), but no observable spatially long-range antiferromagnetic
order. The static response in the cluster glass phase (sampled on the timescale
set by our resolution) is found to be characterized by an average magnetic spin
direction that lacks any preferred direction. The dynamics that drive this
phase are defined by a magnetic correlation length that gradually increases
with decreasing temperature. However, below $\sim$ 50 K the spatial
correlations gradually becoming more short range indicative of increasing
disorder on cooling, thereby unravelling magnetism, until the low temperature
glass phase sets in at T$_{g}$ $\sim$ 15 K. Neutron spectroscopy is used to
characterize the spin fluctuations in the cluster glass phase and are found to
be defined by a broadband of frequencies on the scale of $\sim$ THz, termed
here ``fast"" fluctuations. The frequency bandwidth driving the magnetic
fluctuations mimics the correlation length and decreases until $\sim$ 50 K, and
then increases again until the glass transition. Through investigating the
low-energy acoustic phonons we find evidence of multiple distinct structural
regions which form the basis of the clusters, generating a significant amount
of local disorder. We suggest that random molecular fields originating from
conflicting interactions between clusters is important for the destruction of
magnetic order and the eventual formation of the cluster glass in PFN.

response of an ensemble of systems to differing measurement types. Statistical
balance is a core feature of quantum mechanics, underlying quantum mechanical
states, and not yet explained. The concept of ""statistical balance"" is here
explored, comparing its meaning since 2019 with its original meaning in 2001.
Statistical balance now refers to a feature of contexts in which: (a) there is
a prescribed probability other than 0 or 1 for the collective response of an
ensemble to one measurement type; and (b) the collective response of the same
ensemble to another measurement type demonstrates that no well-defined value
can be attributed, for the property relevant to the original measurement type,
to individual members of the ensemble. In some unexplained way, the outcomes of
single runs of a measurement of the original type ""balance"" each other to give
an overall result in line with the prescribed probability. Unexplained
statistical balance prompts caution in assessing the conceptual implications of
entanglement, measurement, uncertainty, and two-slit and Bell-type analyses.
Physicists have a responsibility to the wider population to be conceptually
precise about quantum mechanics, and to make clear that many possible
conceptual implications are uncertain.

agreement test the tester is given access to subsets of fixed size of some set,
each equipped with an assignment. The tester is then tasked with testing
whether these local assignments agree with some global assignment over the
entire set. One natural generalization of this concept is the case where,
instead of a single assignment to each local view, the tester is given access
to $l$ different assignments for every subset. The tester is then tasked with
testing whether there exist $l$ global functions that agree with all of the
assignments of all of the local views.
  In this work we present sufficient condition for a set system to exhibit this
generalized definition of list agreement expansion. This is, to our knowledge,
the first work to consider this natural generalization of agreement testing.
Despite initially appearing very similar to agreement expansion, list agreement
expansion seem to require a different set of techniques. This is due to the
fact that the natural extension of agreement testing does not suffice when
testing for list agreement, as list agreement crucially relies on a global
structure. It follows that if a local assignments satisfy list agreement they
must not only agree locally but also exhibit some additional structure. In
order to test for the existence of this additional structure we use a
connection between covering spaces of a high dimensional complex and its
coboundaries. We use this connection as a form of ``decoupling''.
  Moreover, we show that any set system that exhibits list agreement expansion
also supports direct sum testing. This is the first scheme for direct sum
testing that works regardless of the parity of the sizes of the local sets.
Prior to our work the schemes for direct sum testing were based on the parity
of the sizes of the local tests.

The lattice
comprises two sublattices of parallel chains with magnetic dipoles at their
vertices. Due to orthogonal easy planes of rotation for dipoles belonging to
different sublattices, the total dipolar energy of this system is separable
into a sum of symmetric and chiral long-ranged interactions between the magnets
where the last takes the form of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling. For a specific
range of values of the offset between sublattices, the dipoles realize an
equilibrium magnetic state in the lattice plane, consisting of one chain
settled in an antiferromagnetic parallel configuration and the other in a
collinear ferromagnetic fashion. If the offset grows beyond this value, the
internal Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya field stabilizes two Bloch domain walls at the
edges of the antiferromagnetic chain. The dynamics of these solitons is studied
by deriving the long-wavelength lagrangian density for the easy axis
antiferromagnet. We find that the chiral couplings between sublattices give
rise to an effective magnetic field that stabilizes the solitons in the
antiferromagnet. When the chains displace respect to each other, an emergent
Lorentz force accelerates the domain walls along the lattice.

  single-particle cryo-electron microscopy",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-reference alignment (MRA) is the problem of recovering a signal from
its multiple noisy copies, each acted upon by a random group element. MRA is
mainly motivated by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that has
recently joined X-ray crystallography as one of the two leading technologies to
reconstruct biological molecular structures. Previous papers have shown that in
the high noise regime, the sample complexity of MRA and cryo-EM is
$n=\omega(\sigma^{2d})$, where $n$ is the number of observations, $\sigma^2$ is
the variance of the noise, and $d$ is the lowest-order moment of the
observations that uniquely determines the signal. In particular, it was shown
that in many cases, $d=3$ for generic signals, and thus the sample complexity
is $n=\omega(\sigma^6)$.
  In this paper, we analyze the second moment of the MRA and cryo-EM models.
First, we show that in both models the second moment determines the signal up
to a set of unitary matrices, whose dimension is governed by the decomposition
of the space of signals into irreducible representations of the group. Second,
we derive sparsity conditions under which a signal can be recovered from the
second moment, implying sample complexity of $n=\omega(\sigma^4)$. Notably, we
show that the sample complexity of cryo-EM is $n=\omega(\sigma^4)$ if at most
one third of the coefficients representing the molecular structure are
non-zero; this bound is near-optimal. The analysis is based on tools from
representation theory and algebraic geometry. We also derive bounds on
recovering a sparse signal from its power spectrum, which is the main
computational problem of X-ray crystallography.

configures the tilt angle, vertical half-power beamwidth (HPBW), and horizontal
HPBW of each cell's antenna array across the network. The novel data-driven
framework proposed for this non-convex problem, inspired by Bayesian
optimization (BO) and differential evolution algorithms, is sample-efficient
and converges quickly, while being scalable to large networks. By jointly
optimizing DL and UL performance, we take into account the different signal
power and interference characteristics of these two links, allowing a graceful
trade-off between coverage and capacity in each one. Our experiments on a
state-of-the-art 5G NR cellular system-level simulator developed by AT&T Labs
show that the proposed algorithm consistently and significantly outperforms the
3GPP default settings, random search, and conventional BO. In one realistic
setting, and compared to conventional BO, our approach increases the average
sum-log-rate by over 60% while decreasing the outage probability by over 80%.
Compared to the 3GPP default settings, the gains from our approach are
considerably larger. The results also indicate that the practically important
combination of DL throughput and UL coverage can be greatly improved by joint
UL-DL optimization.

cores due to accretion over long timescales can lead to the formation of a mini
black hole. In this scenario, the neutron star is destabilized and implodes to
form a black hole without significantly increasing its mass. When this process
occurs in neutron stars in coalescing binaries, one or both stars might be
converted to a black hole before they merge. Thus, in the mass range of $\sim
\mbox{1--2}\, M_\odot,$ the Universe might contain three distinct populations
of compact binaries: one containing only neutron stars, the second population
of only black holes, and a third, mixed population consisting of a neutron star
and a black hole. However, it is unlikely to have a mixed population as the
various timescales allow for both neutron stars to remain or collapse within a
short timescale. In this paper, we explore the capability of future
gravitational-wave detector networks, including upgrades of Advanced LIGO and
Virgo, and new facilities such as the Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope
(XG network), to discriminate between different populations by measuring the
effective tidal deformability of the binary, which is zero for binary black
holes but nonzero for binary neutron stars. Furthermore, we show that observing
the relative abundances of the different populations can be used to infer the
timescale for neutron stars to implode into black holes, and in turn, provide
constraints on the particle nature of dark matter. The XG network will infer
the implosion timescale to within an accuracy of 0.01 Gyr at 90% credible
interval and determine the dark matter mass and interaction cross section to
within a factor of 2 GeV and 10 cm$^{-2}$, respectively.

User-schedulable languages strike a balance between abstraction and control in

should compute from a schedule for how to compute it. In the process, they make
a novel language soundness claim: the result of a program should always be the
same, regardless of how it is scheduled. This soundness guarantee is tricky to
provide in the presence of schedules that introduce redundant recomputation and
computation on uninitialized data, rather than simply reordering statements. In
addition, Halide ensures memory safety through a compile-time bounds inference
engine that determines safe sizes for every buffer and loop in the generated

Hamiltonian. We accomplish this using a Green's function solution. We can model
realistic physical implementations of MSQs by parameterizing the tight-binding
Hamiltonian with first-principles descriptions of magnetic anisotropy and
exchange interactions. We find that for two-MSQ systems with inversion
symmetry, the spin degree of freedom of the scattered electron offers
probabilistic control of the degree of entanglement between the MSQs.

computation, with numerous extensions and applications. As such, much effort
has been put into mapping PC faithfully onto the cortex, but there are issues
that remain unresolved or controversial. In particular, current implementations
often involve separate value and error neurons and require symmetric forward
and backward weights across different brain regions. These features have not
been experimentally confirmed. In this work, we show that the PC framework in
the linear regime can be modified to map faithfully onto the cortical hierarchy
in a manner compatible with empirical observations. By employing a
disentangling-inspired constraint on hidden-layer neural activities, we derive
an upper bound for the PC objective. Optimization of this upper bound leads to
an algorithm that shows the same performance as the original objective and maps
onto a biologically plausible network. The units of this network can be
interpreted as multi-compartmental neurons with non-Hebbian learning rules,
with a remarkable resemblance to recent experimental findings. There exist
prior models which also capture these features, but they are phenomenological,
while our work is a normative derivation. The network we derive does not
involve one-to-one connectivity or signal multiplexing, which the
phenomenological models required, indicating that these features are not
necessary for learning in the cortex. The normative nature of our algorithm in
the simplified linear case allows us to prove interesting properties of the
framework and analytically understand the computational role of our network's
components. The parameters of our network have natural interpretations as
physiological quantities in a multi-compartmental model of pyramidal neurons,

octupole moments can be exhibited by an in-plane electric current and lead to
accumulation of staggered spin densities at the corners of a rectangular-shaped

Approximate Policy Iteration (API), called Confident Approximate Policy
Iteration (CAPI), which computes a deterministic stationary policy with an
optimal error bound scaling linearly with the product of the effective horizon
$H$ and the worst-case approximation error $\epsilon$ of the action-value
functions of stationary policies. This improvement over API (whose error scales
with $H^2$) comes at the price of an $H$-fold increase in memory cost. Unlike
Scherrer and Lesner [2012], who recommended computing a non-stationary policy
to achieve a similar improvement (with the same memory overhead), we are able
to stick to stationary policies. This allows for our second contribution, the
application of CAPI to planning with local access to a simulator and
$d$-dimensional linear function approximation. As such, we design a planning
algorithm that applies CAPI to obtain a sequence of policies with successively
refined accuracies on a dynamically evolving set of states. The algorithm
outputs an $\tilde O(\sqrt{d}H\epsilon)$-optimal policy after issuing $\tilde
O(dH^4/\epsilon^2)$ queries to the simulator, simultaneously achieving the
optimal accuracy bound and the best known query complexity bound, while earlier
algorithms in the literature achieve only one of them. This query complexity is
shown to be tight in all parameters except $H$. These improvements come at the
expense of a mild (polynomial) increase in memory and computational costs of
both the algorithm and its output policy.

millions of qubits to become practical for solving real-world problems.
Although a variety of qubit technologies have been demonstrated, scalability
remains a major hurdle. Superconducting (SC) qubits are one of the most mature
and promising technologies to overcome this challenge. However, these qubits
reside in a millikelvin cryogenic dilution fridge, isolating them from thermal
and electrical noise. They are controlled by a rack-full of external
electronics through extremely complex wiring and cables. Although thousands of
qubits can be fabricated on a single chip and cooled down to millikelvin
temperatures, scaling up the control and readout electronics remains an elusive
goal. This is mainly due to the limited available cooling power in cryogenic
systems constraining the wiring capacity and cabling heat load management.
  In this paper, we focus on scaling up the number of XY-control lines by using
cryogenic RF-photonic links. This is one of the major roadblocks to build a
thousand qubit superconducting QC. We will first review and study the
challenges of state-of-the-art proposed approaches, including cryogenic CMOS

qubit systems. We will discuss their limitations due to the active power
dissipation and passive heat leakage in detail. By analytically modeling the
noise sources and thermal budget limits, we will show that our solution can
achieve a scale up to a thousand of qubits. Our proposed method can be
seamlessly implemented using advanced silicon photonic processes, and the
number of required optical fibers can be further reduced by using wavelength

relevant quantitative properties in subsequent images. Due to the necessity to
track features with a wide array of shapes and length scales while maintaining
spatial resolution, wavelet transforms were chosen as a potent signal analysis
tool. In addition to addressing multiple length scales, this method can be used
in conjunction with other signal processing methods such as image binarization
for increased functionality. In this article, we demonstrate three effective
use of wavelet analyses pertaining to DFXM. We show how to extract and track
smooth linear features-which are diffraction manifestations of twin

research, chaired by Michael Littman of Brown University. The report, entitled
""Gathering Strength, Gathering Storms,"" answers a set of 14 questions probing
critical areas of AI development addressing the major risks and dangers of AI,
its effects on society, its public perception and the future of the field. The
report concludes that AI has made a major leap from the lab to people's lives
in recent years, which increases the urgency to understand its potential
negative effects. The questions were developed by the AI100 Standing Committee,
chaired by Peter Stone of the University of Texas at Austin, consisting of a
group of AI leaders with expertise in computer science, sociology, ethics,
economics, and other disciplines.

the triple interactions between the links (structural balance) or the triple
interaction of nodes and links (coevolutionary balance). In the structural
balance theory, the links are not independent from each other, implying a
global effect of this term and it leads to a discontinuous phase transition in
the system's balanced states as a function of temperature. However, in the
coevolutionary balance the links only connect two local nodes and a continuous
phase transition emerges. In this paper, we consider a combination of both in
order to understand which of these types of interactions will identify the
stability of the network. We are interested to see how adjusting the robustness
of each term versus the other might affect the system to reach a balanced
state. We use statistical mechanics methods and the mean field theory and also
the Monte-Carlo numerical simulations to investigate the behaviour of the order
parameters and the total energy of the system. We find the phase diagram of the
system which demonstrates the competition of these two terms at different
ratios against each other and different temperatures. The system shows a
tricritical point above which the phase transition switches from continuous to
discrete. Also the superiority of the local perspective is observed at low
temperatures and the global view will be the dominant term in determining the
stability of the system at higher temperatures.

Mean-based residuals are generated for cell groups and evaluated using
Principal Component Analysis. The evaluated residuals are then thresholded
using a cumulative sum control chart to detect anomalies. The mild external
short circuits associated with cell balancing are detected in the voltage
signals and necessitate voltage retraining after balancing. Temperature
residuals prove to be critical, enabling anomaly detection of module balancing

Statistical testing of the proposed approach is performed on the experimental
data from a battery electric locomotive injected with model-based anomalies.
The proposed anomaly detection approach has a low false-positive rate and
accurately detects and traces the synthetic voltage and temperature anomalies.
The performance of the proposed approach compared with direct thresholding of
mean-based residuals shows a 56% faster detection time, 42% fewer false

reform targeted at the sector and product level. Difference-in-differences
estimates instrumented by sector eligibility show that a 20 percentage point
cut on payroll tax rates caused a 9% employment increase at the firm level,
mostly driven by small firms. This expansion is not driven by formalization of
existing workers, and it is explained by reduction on separations rather than
additional hires. In terms of earnings, there is a significant 4% earnings
increase in the long run, which is concentrated at leadership positions. The
unequal pass-through worsen within-firm wage inequality. I exploit the
exogenous variation on labor cost to document substantial labor market power in
Brazil, where wages are marked down by 36%. Consistent with the empirical
findings, I develop a model of factor demand with imperfect competition in the
goods and labor market to shed light on the mechanism through which imperfect
competition drives corporate tax incidence. The model is identified by the
reduced form elasticities, and allows me to structurally estimate the
capital-labor elasticity of substitution, which differs from the benchmark case

decades, with applications ranging from astronomy to zoology. A long time
series may not be necessary in practice to achieve only a desired level of
prediction accuracy. This work addresses the following fundamental question:
How much recent historical data is required to achieve a targeted percentage of
statistical prediction efficiency compared to the full time series data?
Consequently, the sequential back subsampling (SBS) method, a novel dual
efficient forecasting framework, is proposed to estimate the percentage of most
recent historical data that achieves computational efficiency (via subsampling)
while maintaining a desired level of prediction accuracy (almost as good as
compared to full data). Theoretical justification using the asymptotic
prediction theory based on traditional AutoRegressive (AR) Models is provided.
This framework has been shown to work for recent machine learning forecasting
methods even when the models might be misspecified, with empirical illustration
using both simulated data and applications to data on financial stock prices
and covid-19. The main conclusion is that only a fraction of the most recent
historical data provides near-optimal or even better practically relevant

inspires the design of attention mechanisms in deep neural networks. However,
most of the visual attention studies adopted eye-tracking data rather than the
direct measurement of brain activity to characterize human visual attention. In
addition, the adversarial relationship between the attention-related objects
and attention-neglected background in the human visual system was not fully
exploited. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel brain-inspired adversarial
visual attention network (BI-AVAN) to characterize human visual attention
directly from functional brain activity. Our BI-AVAN model imitates the biased
competition process between attention-related/neglected objects to identify and
locate the visual objects in a movie frame the human brain focuses on in an
unsupervised manner. We use independent eye-tracking data as ground truth for
validation and experimental results show that our model achieves robust and
promising results when inferring meaningful human visual attention and mapping
the relationship between brain activities and visual stimuli. Our BI-AVAN model
contributes to the emerging field of leveraging the brain's functional
architecture to inspire and guide the model design in artificial intelligence

everyday objects. Today's assistive robot arms use rigid grippers to pinch
items between fingers; while these rigid grippers are well suited for large and
heavy objects, they often struggle to grasp small, numerous, or delicate items
(such as foods). Soft grippers cover the opposite end of the spectrum; these
grippers use adhesives or change shape to wrap around small and irregular
items, but cannot exert the large forces needed to manipulate heavy objects. In
this paper we introduce RIgid-SOft (RISO) grippers that combine switchable soft
adhesives with standard rigid mechanisms to enable a diverse range of robotic
grasping. We develop RISO grippers by leveraging a novel class of soft
materials that change adhesion force in real-time through pneumatically
controlled shape and rigidity tuning. By mounting these soft adhesives on the
bottom of rigid fingers, we create a gripper that can interact with objects
using either purely rigid grasps (pinching the object) or purely soft grasps
(adhering to the object). This increased capability requires additional
decision making, and we therefore formulate a shared control approach that
partially automates the motion of the robot arm. In practice, this controller
aligns the RISO gripper while inferring which object the human wants to grasp
and how the human wants to grasp that item. Our user study demonstrates that
RISO grippers can pick up, move, and release household items from existing
datasets, and that the system performs grasps more successfully and efficiently
when sharing control between the human and robot. See videos here:

by formation of a chain array of spherical nanoparticles. In this paper, a base
model of a morphological instability of a nanowire on a substrate in the
applied electric field directed along a nanowire axis is considered. Exact
analytical solution is obtained for 90 degrees contact angle and, assuming
axisymmetric perturbations, for a free-standing wire. The latter solution
extends the 1965 result by Nichols and Mullins without electromigration effect
(F.A. Nichols and W.W. Mullins, Trans. Metall. Soc. AIME 233, 1840-1848

numerically. It is shown that a stronger applied electric field (a stronger
current) results in a larger instability growth rate and a decrease of the most
dangerous unstable wavelength; in experiment, the latter is expected to yield
more dense chain array of nanoparticles. Also it is noted that a wire
crystallographic orientation on a substrate has larger impact on stability in a
stronger electric field and that a simple switching of the polarity of
electrical contacts, i.e. the reversal of the direction of the applied electric

proposed surrogate's architecture is structured as a tree, with leaf nodes
representing separate neural operator blocks where physics is embedded in the
form of multiple soft and hard constraints. The hierarchical attribute has two
advantages: i) It allows the simplification of the training phase via transfer
learning, starting from the slowest temporal scales; ii) It accelerates the
prediction step by enabling adaptivity as the surrogate's evaluation is limited
to the necessary leaf nodes based on the local degree of non-equilibrium of the

application to hypersonic flight, and it is tested here on pure oxygen gas

role in the rotational properties and evolution of asteroids. While the YORP
effect induced by the macroscopic shape of the asteroid and by the presence of
surface boulders has been well studied, no investigation has been performed yet
regarding how craters with given properties influence this effect.
  We introduce and estimate the crater-induced YORP effect (CYORP), which
arises from the concave structure of the crater, to investigate the magnitude
of the resulting torques as a function of varying properties of the crater and
the asteroid by a semi-analytical method.
  The CYORP torque can be comparable to the normal YORP torque when the size of
the crater is about one-tenth of the size of the asteroid, or equivalently when
the crater/roughness covers one-tenth of the asteroid's surface. Although the
torque decreases with the crater size, the combined contribution of all small
craters can become non-negligible due to their large number when the commonly
used power-law crater size distribution is considered. The CYORP torque of
small concave structures, usually considered as surface roughness, is essential
to the accurate calculation of the complete YORP torque. Under the CYORP effect
that is produced by collisions, asteroids go through a random walk in spin rate
and obliquity, with a YORP reset timescale typically of 0.4 Myr. This has
strong implications for the rotational evolution and orbital evolution of
asteroids.
  Craters and roughness on asteroid surfaces can influence the YORP torques and
therefore the rotational properties and evolution of asteroids. We suggest that
the CYORP effect should be considered in the future investigation of the YORP
effect on asteroids.

arising in communication, sonar, and radar fields. However, conventional
analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) can suffer from significant information
loss when processing signals that are orders of magnitude larger than the ADC's
threshold. To address this issue, the Unlimited Sampling (US) strategy was
introduced, which applies a modulo operator prior to sampling to avoid
saturation. In this paper, we study LSE via unlimited sampling. By exploiting
the oversampling property and proving that the leakage onto the tail frequency
can be controlled, we establish an optimization problem in the Fourier and
first-order difference domain. We then propose a dynamic programming (DP) based
algorithm followed by orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) method to solve it. In
addition, a two-stage US LSE (USLSE) is proposed where the line spectral signal
is first recovered by iteratively executing DP and OMP, and then the parameters
are estimated by applying a state-of-art LSE algorithm. Unlike other works that
consider noise added in modulo samples, this paper tackles the more challenging
scenario of noise added in original samples. Substantial numerical simulations
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm, USLSE, outperforms existing algorithms
in such a scenario. In addition, the simulation validates that the first stage
of USLSE can also be used to recover bandlimited signals. Finally, we process
the real data generated by AWR1642, and the results show that USLSE estimates
two people with maximum folding times being $2$, and estimates one corner and
two people with maximum folding times being $5$.

topological codes, will most likely require lattice surgery protocols in order
to implement a universal gate set. Timelike failures during lattice surgery
protocols can result in logical failures during the execution of an algorithm.
In addition to the spacelike distance of the topological code used to protect
the qubits from errors, there is also the timelike distance which is given by
the number of syndrome measurement rounds during a lattice surgery protocol. As
such, a larger timelike distance requirement will result in the slowdown of an
algorithm's runtime. Temporal encoding of lattice surgery (TELS) is a technique
which can be used to reduce the number of syndrome measurement rounds that are
required during a lattice surgery protocol. This is done by measuring an
over-complete set of mutually commuting multi-qubit Pauli operators (referred
to as a parallelizable Pauli set) which form codewords of a classical error
correcting code. The results of the over-complete set of Pauli measurements can
then be used to detect and possibly correct timelike lattice surgery failures.
In this work, we introduce an improved TELS protocol and subsequently augment
it with the ability to correct low-weight classical errors, resulting in
greater speedups in algorithm runtimes. We also explore large families of
classical error correcting codes for a wide range of parallelizable Pauli set
sizes. We also apply TELS to magic state distillation protocols in the context
of biased noise, where logical qubits are encoded in asymmetric surface codes.
Using optimized layouts, we show improvements in the space-time cost of our
magic state factories compared to previous protocols. Such improvements are
achieved using computations performed in the Clifford frame.

harness the power of unlabeled data, with no annotation effort. A number of
developed approaches are evolving with the goal of outperforming supervised
alternatives, which have been relatively successful. One main issue in SSL is
robustness of the approaches under different settings. In this paper, for the
first time, we recognize the fundamental limits of SSL coming from the use of a
single-supervisory signal. To address this limitation, we leverage the power of
uncertainty representation to devise a robust and general standard hierarchical
learning/training protocol for any SSL baseline, regardless of their
assumptions and approaches. Essentially, using the information bottleneck
principle, we decompose feature learning into a two-stage training procedure,
each with a distinct supervision signal. This double supervision approach is
captured in two key steps: 1) invariance enforcement to data augmentation, and
2) fuzzy pseudo labeling (both hard and soft annotation). This simple, yet,
effective protocol which enables cross-class/cluster feature learning, is
instantiated via an initial training of an ensemble of models through
invariance enforcement to data augmentation as first training phase, and then
assigning fuzzy labels to the original samples for the second training phase.
We consider multiple alternative scenarios with double supervision and evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach on recent baselines, covering four different
SSL paradigms, including geometrical, contrastive, non-contrastive, and
hard/soft whitening (redundancy reduction) baselines. Extensive experiments
under multiple settings show that the proposed training protocol consistently
improves the performance of the former baselines, independent of their
respective underlying principles.

limiting the local training from drifting far away from the global model.
Previous studies accomplish this by regularizing the distance between the

estimator allows for many covariates and is less biased, consistent, and
$\sqrt{n}$-asymptotically normal under standard regularity conditions. Our

  Implementation of Wireless Sensor Networks based on Serverless Computing","23 pages, 5 figures","Serverless Computing: Principles and Paradigms, 2023",,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wireless sensor network (WSN) has been developed for decades and have
performed well in the performance, power consumption, and congestion control.
However, the following problems have not been addressed, such as inaccurate
cost estimation of device's lifecycle, highly-coupled engineering development,
and low utilization of hardware and software resources during the life cycle of
WSN. Therefore, we first propose the conceptual view of maintainability
implementation for WSN based on Serverless Computing. The maintainability
implementation refers to the ability to meet the WSN product to consume the
minimum resources with a higher probability in configuration, trial production,
debugging, batch production, deployment, operation, and maintenance phases. And
then, we discuss that Serverless Computing can be realized at the software
functional level of WSN to decouple the device operation and functional
development, greatly improve the reuse of resources and exclude the hardware
interference. From the perspective of maintainability and cost control, the
concept of Serverless Computing can be used to build WSN platforms, which can
support the functions of data collection and data management into functional
development that may benefit from exploration through upfront expenditures,
thereby significantly reducing design, manufacturing, and operational costs.
Finally, based on existing technologies and smart city scenarios, the idea of a
WSN platform for Serverless Computing is given with a case study.

  Crystals",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many solid materials and liquid crystals exhibit geometric frustration,
meaning that they have an ideal local structure that cannot fill up space. For
that reason, the global phase must be a compromise between the ideal local
structure and geometric constraints. As an explicit example of geometric
frustration, we consider a chiral liquid crystal confined in a long cylinder
with free boundaries. When the radius of the tube is sufficiently small, the
director field forms a double-twist configuration, which is the ideal local
structure. However, when the radius becomes larger (compared with the natural
twist of the liquid crystal), the double-twist structure cannot fill space, and
hence the director field must transform into some other chiral structure that
can fill space. This space-filling structure may be either (1) a cholesteric
phase with single twist, or (2) a set of double-twist regions separated by a
disclination, which can be regarded as the beginning of a blue phase. We
investigate these structures using theory and simulations, and show how the
relative free energies depend on the system size, the natural twist, and the
disclination energy. As another example, we also study a cholesteric liquid
crystal confined between two infinite parallel plates with free boundaries.

rotational inertia can be compensated for by fast acting IBRs participating in
frequency response services, by rapidly injecting into or removing power from
the grid. Currently, there are still relative small number of sizable IBRs in
the grid. Therefore, the placement of the IBRs in the system, as well as the
inverter configuration type and controller, will have a material impact on the
frequency response of the grid. In this work, we present an optimal placement
algorithm that maximizes the benefits of utilizing IBRs in providing frequency

while using a minimal amount of electric power injection from the IBRs. The
proposed algorithm uses the resistance distance to place the IBRs at nodes that
are central to the rest of the nodes in the network thus minimizing the
distance of power flow. The proposed greedy algorithm achieves a near optimal
performance and relies on the supermodularity of the resistance distances. We
validate the performance of the placement algorithm on three IEEE test systems
of varying sizes, by comparing its performance to an exhaustive search
algorithm. We further evaluate the performance of the placed IBRs on an IEEE
test system, to determine their impact on frequency stability. The IBRs are

Jupiters, which are gas giant planets with orbital periods of a few days and
found in 0.1-1% of Sun-like stars. Hot Jupiters are expected to be engulfed
during their host star's radial expansion on the red giant branch. Planetary
engulfment has been studied extensively as it may account for observed rapidly
rotating and chemically enriched giant stars. We perform 3D hydrodynamical
simulations of hot Jupiter engulfment by a 1 solar mass, 4 solar radii early
red giant. Our ""global"" simulations simultaneously resolve the stellar envelope
and planetary structure, modelling the hot Jupiter as a polytropic gas sphere.
We find that approximately 90% of the hot Jupiter's mass is ablated in the
convective part of the giant envelope, which would enhance the surface lithium
abundance by 0.1 dex. The hot Jupiter is disrupted by a combination of ram
pressure and tidal forces near the base of the convective envelope, with the

take advantage of distributed data in edge systems, centralized training can be
replaced by federated learning where each client only needs to upload model
updates produced by training on its local data. These model updates are
aggregated into a single global model by the server. But since different
clients can have different attributes, model updates can have diverse weights
and as a result, it can take a long time for the aggregated global model to
converge. To speed up the convergence process, we can apply clustering to group

factors to be taken into account in the design of UAV offloading schemes must
include the number of tasks waiting in the system as well as their
corresponding deadlines. An appropriate system cost which is used as an
objective function to be minimized comprises two parts. First, an offloading
cost which can be interpreted as the cost of using computational resources at
the UAV. Second, a penalty cost due to potential task expiration. In order to
minimize the expected (time average) cost over a time horizon, we formulate a
Dynamic Programming (DP) equation and analyze it to describe properties of a

well-known ""Curse of Dimensionality"" that makes computations intractable,

optimal task offloading decision associated with a state can be inferred from
the decision taken at its ""adjacent"" states, further reducing the computational

their attenuation with the extragalactic background light (EBL). For these
reasons, the recent observation of photons with energies of 18 and 251 TeV from
GRB 221009A (z=0.151) last October 9th, 2022 has challenged what we know about
the TeV-emission mechanisms and the extragalactic background. In order to
explain the TeV observations, recent works exploring candidates of dark matter

limitations within the most plausible scenario, synchrotron-self Compton (SSC)
radiation in the GRB afterglow, to interpret the one 18-TeV photon observation

this paper, we explore the importance of lexical and semantic matching in the

important factor in strong performance, even when the datastore is derived from
the training data; and (2) the $k$NN-LM is most beneficial when retrieved items
have high semantic similarity with the query. Based on our analysis, we define
a new formulation of the $k$NN-LM that uses retrieval quality to assign the

approach on two English language modeling datasets, Wikitext-103 and PG-19. Our
re-formulation of the $k$NN-LM is beneficial in both cases, and leads to nearly

TTS models is expensive as each of them requires significant footprint and
separate computational resources (e.g., accelerators, memory). To scale speaker
adapted neural TTS voices to hundreds of speakers while preserving the
naturalness and speaker similarity, this paper proposes a parameter-efficient
few-shot speaker adaptation, where the backbone model is augmented with
trainable lightweight modules called residual adapters. This architecture
allows the backbone model to be shared across different target speakers.
Experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve competitive
naturalness and speaker similarity compared to the full fine-tuning approaches,
while requiring only $\sim$0.1% of the backbone model parameters for each
speaker.

halo spin vectors in the high-mass section exhibit a transition from the Tweb
intermediate to major principal axes as they are measured at more inner radii,
which holds for both of the dark matter and baryonic components. The radius
threshold at which the transition occurs depends on the smoothing scale,
$R_{f}$, becoming larger as $R_{f}$ decreases. For the case of the Vweb, the
occurrence of the radius-dependent spin transition is witnessed only when
$R_{f}\ge 1\, h^{-1}$Mpc. Repeating the same analysis but with the vorticity
vectors, we reveal a critical difference from the spins. The vorticity vectors
are always perpendicular to the Tweb (Vweb) major principal axes, regardless of
$R_{f}$, which indicates that the halo inner spins are not strongly affected by
the generation of vorticity. It is also shown that the halo spins, as well as
the Tweb (Vweb) principal axes, have more directional coherence over a wide

is a crucial requirement for AI agents. Interactive reward learning from
trajectory comparisons (a.k.a. RLHF) is one way to allow non-expert users to
convey complex objectives by expressing preferences over short clips of agent
behaviors. Even though this parametric method can encode complex tacit
knowledge present in the underlying tasks, it implicitly assumes that the human
is unable to provide richer feedback than binary preference labels, leading to
intolerably high feedback complexity and poor user experience. While providing
a detailed symbolic closed-form specification of the objectives might be
tempting, it is not always feasible even for an expert user. However, in most
cases, humans are aware of how the agent should change its behavior along
meaningful axes to fulfill their underlying purpose, even if they are not able
to fully specify task objectives symbolically. Using this as motivation, we
introduce the notion of Relative Behavioral Attributes, which allows the users
to tweak the agent behavior through symbolic concepts (e.g., increasing the
softness or speed of agents' movement). We propose two practical methods that
can learn to model any kind of behavioral attributes from ordered behavior
clips. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on four tasks with nine
different behavioral attributes, showing that once the attributes are learned,
end users can produce desirable agent behaviors relatively effortlessly, by
providing feedback just around ten times. This is over an order of magnitude
less than that required by the popular learning-from-human-preferences
baselines. The supplementary video and source code are available at:

  Transport",,,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We address key challenges in long-horizon embodied exploration and navigation
by proposing a new object transport task and a novel modular framework for
temporally extended navigation. Our first contribution is the design of a novel
Long-HOT environment focused on deep exploration and long-horizon planning
where the agent is required to efficiently find and pick up target objects to
be carried and dropped at a goal location, with load constraints and optional
access to a container if it finds one. Further, we propose a modular
hierarchical transport policy (HTP) that builds a topological graph of the
scene to perform exploration with the help of weighted frontiers. Our
hierarchical approach uses a combination of motion planning algorithms to reach
point goals within explored locations and object navigation policies for moving
towards semantic targets at unknown locations. Experiments on both our proposed
Habitat transport task and on MultiOn benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms baselines and prior works. Further, we validate the
effectiveness of our modular approach for long-horizon transport by
demonstrating meaningful generalization to much harder transport scenes with
training only on simpler versions of the task.

Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/spa-unida",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) deals with the problem of knowledge
transfer between two datasets with domain-shift as well as category-shift. The
goal is to categorize unlabeled target samples, either into one of the ""known""
categories or into a single ""unknown"" category. A major problem in UniDA is
negative transfer, i.e. misalignment of ""known"" and ""unknown"" classes. To this
end, we first uncover an intriguing tradeoff between negative-transfer-risk and
domain-invariance exhibited at different layers of a deep network. It turns out
we can strike a balance between these two metrics at a mid-level layer. Towards
designing an effective framework based on this insight, we draw motivation from
Bag-of-visual-Words (BoW). Word-prototypes in a BoW-like representation of a
mid-level layer would represent lower-level visual primitives that are likely
to be unaffected by the category-shift in the high-level features. We develop
modifications that encourage learning of word-prototypes followed by
word-histogram based classification. Following this, subsidiary prototype-space
alignment (SPA) can be seen as a closed-set alignment problem, thereby avoiding
negative transfer. We realize this with a novel word-histogram-related pretext
task to enable closed-set SPA, operating in conjunction with goal task UniDA.
We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on top of existing UniDA
techniques, yielding state-of-the-art performance across three standard UniDA
and Open-Set DA object recognition benchmarks.

is a large population of known exoplanets that either do not transit their star
or have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method at very small angular
separations such that they are inaccessible to traditional coronagraph systems.
Vortex Fiber Nulling (VFN) is a new single-aperture interferometric technique
that uses the entire telescope pupil to bridge the gap between traditional
coronagraphy and RV or Transit methods by enabling the direct observation and
spectral characterization of targets at and within the diffraction limit. By
combining a vortex mask with a single mode fiber, the on-axis starlight is
rejected while the off-axis planet light is coupled and efficiently routed to a
radiometer or spectrograph for analysis. We have demonstrated VFN in the lab
monochromatically in the past. In this paper we present a polychromatic
validation of VFN with nulls of $<10^{-4}$ across 15% bandwidth light. We also
provide an update on deployment plans and predicted yield estimates for the VFN

PSISIM, a simulation package developed in cooperation with several groups, we
assess KPIC VFN's ability to detect and characterize different types of targets

sub-Jupiter mass planets down to 5 milliarcseconds from their star.

effective intrusion detection for large-scale scarcely labelled IoT domain. As
a multi-source heterogeneous domain adaptation (MS-HDA) method, the JSTN
integrates a knowledge rich network intrusion (NI) domain and another
small-scale IoT intrusion (II) domain as source domains, and preserves
intrinsic semantic properties to assist target II domain intrusion detection.
The JSTN jointly transfers the following three semantics to learn a
domain-invariant and discriminative feature representation. The scenario
semantic endows source NI and II domain with characteristics from each other to
ease the knowledge transfer process via a confused domain discriminator and
categorical distribution knowledge preservation. It also reduces the
source-target discrepancy to make the shared feature space domain-invariant.
Meanwhile, the weighted implicit semantic transfer boosts discriminability via
a fine-grained knowledge preservation, which transfers the source categorical
distribution to the target domain. The source-target divergence guides the
importance weighting during knowledge preservation to reflect the degree of
knowledge learning. Additionally, the hierarchical explicit semantic alignment
performs centroid-level and representative-level alignment with the help of a
geometric similarity-aware pseudo-label refiner, which exploits the value of
unlabelled target II domain and explicitly aligns feature representations from
a global and local perspective in a concentrated manner. Comprehensive
experiments on various tasks verify the superiority of the JSTN against
state-of-the-art comparing methods, on average a 10.3% of accuracy boost is
achieved. The statistical soundness of each constituting component and the
computational efficiency are also verified.

avoids the global shape shrinkage during denoising. GeoGCN is a new PCD

help of VNs, 2) then estimates initial RNs by performing Principal Component
Analysis on the regressed points, and 3) finally regresses fine RNs by
normalbased GCN. Unlike existing PCD methods, GeoGCN not only exploits two
kinds of geometry expertise (i.e., RN and VN) but also benefits from training

noise-robustness and local-and-global feature preservation.

other upgrades to the FIU/FEU. The use of single-mode fibers provides a gain in

the bottlenecks of high computation complexity and excessive fronthaul

processing (DPB) architecture has been proposed, where the BS antennas are
partitioned into multiple clusters, and each is connected to a local baseband
unit (BBU). In this paper, we are interested in the low-complexity distributed
channel estimation (CE) method under such DBP architecture, which is rarely
studied in the literature. The aim is to devise distributed CE algorithms that
can perform as well as the centralized scheme but with a small inter-BBU
communication cost. Specifically, based on the low-complexity diagonal minimum
mean square error channel estimator, we propose two distributed CE algorithms,
namely the aggregate-then-estimate algorithm and the estimate-then-aggregate
algorithm. In contrast to the existing distributed CE algorithm which requires
iterative information exchanges among the nodes, our algorithms only require
one roundtrip communication among BBUs. Extensive experiment results are
presented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed distributed CE
algorithms in terms of estimation accuracy, inter-BBU communication cost, and
computation complexity.

vital nodes. Finding the best set of vital nodes (eigenshield nodes) is
critical to the network's robustness against rumor spreading and cascading
failures, which makes it one of the fundamental problems in network science.
The problem is challenging as it requires to maximize the influence of nodes in
the set while simultaneously minimizing the redundancies between the set's
nodes. However, the redundancy mechanism is rarely investigated by previous
studies. Here we introduce the matrix perturbation framework to find a small
``eigenshield"" set of nodes that, when removed, lead to the largest drop in the
network's spectral radius. We show that finding the ``eigenshield"" nodes can be
translated into the optimization of an objective function that simultaneously
accounts for the individual influence of each node and redundancy between
different nodes.
  We analytically quantify the influence redundancy that explains why an
important node might play an insignificant role in the ``eigenshield"" node set.
Extensive experiments under diverse influence maximization problems, ranging
from network dismantling to spreading maximization, demonstrate that the
eigenshield detection tends to significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods across most problems. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms that
may lie at the core of the function of vital nodes in complex network.

accurate predictions to be made as much as 24 hours in advance. DELFI
incorporates meteorological data as well as pollutant-based features to ensure
a robust model that is divided into two parts: (i) a stack of three Long

that DELFI offers far superior predictions especially in the long-term as
compared to even non-parametric baselines. The Delhi-NCR recorded the 3rd

where the leader dominates the decision process with the Stackelberg
equilibrium (SE) strategy. However, such a leader-follower scheme may become
invalid in practice due to subjective or objective factors, and then the Nash
equilibrium (NE) strategy may be an alternative option. In this case, the
leader may face a dilemma of choosing an SE strategy or an NE strategy. In this
paper, we focus on a unified three-player leader-follower security game and
study the coincidence between SE and NE. We first explore a necessary and
sufficient condition for the case that each SE is an NE, which can be further
presented concisely when the SE is unique. This condition not only provides
access to seek a satisfactory SE strategy but also makes a criterion to verify
an obtained SE strategy. Then we provide another appropriate condition for the
case that at least one SE is an NE. Moreover, since the coincidence condition
may not always be satisfied, we describe the closeness between SE and NE, and
give an upper bound of their deviation. Finally, we show the applicability of
the obtained theoretical results in several practical security cases, including
the secure transmission problem and the cybersecurity defense.

to synthesize motion with the same semantics as the input text. However, due to
the lack of diverse labeled training data, most approaches either limit to
specific types of text annotations or require online optimizations to cater to
the texts during inference at the cost of efficiency and stability. In this
paper, we investigate offline open-vocabulary text-to-motion generation in a
zero-shot learning manner that neither requires paired training data nor extra
online optimization to adapt for unseen texts. Inspired by the prompt learning
in NLP, we pretrain a motion generator that learns to reconstruct the full
motion from the masked motion. During inference, instead of changing the motion
generator, our method reformulates the input text into a masked motion as the
prompt for the motion generator to ``reconstruct'' the motion. In constructing
the prompt, the unmasked poses of the prompt are synthesized by a text-to-pose
generator. To supervise the optimization of the text-to-pose generator, we
propose the first text-pose alignment model for measuring the alignment between
texts and 3D poses. And to prevent the pose generator from overfitting to
limited training texts, we further propose a novel wordless training mechanism
that optimizes the text-to-pose generator without any training texts. The
comprehensive experimental results show that our method obtains a significant
improvement against the baseline methods. The code is available at

an isospin-sensitive observable and the total transverse energy of Z $\le$ 2
nuclei for experimental centrality sorting. The experimental isospin transport
ratios present, for both the reconstructed QP and its remnant, a clear
evolution towards isospin equilibration with increasing dissipation of the
collision while the full equilibration is not reached. A smoother evolution
with less discrepancies between the two mixed systems in the case of the

characterize the low-density neck emissions. A systematic neutron-enrichment is

particularly for the symmetric systems which present no isospin gradient
between the projectile and the target. We also noticed that the ^{2}H and

mismatches in occlusion and smooth regions. An effective matching window
satisfying three characteristics: texture richness, disparity consistency and
anti-occlusion should be able to prevent mismatches to some extent. According
to these characteristics, we propose matching entropy in the spatial domain of
light field to measure the amount of correct information in a matching window,
which provides the criterion for matching window selection. Based on matching
entropy regularization, we establish an optimization model for depth estimation
with a matching cost fidelity term. To find the optimum, we propose a two-step
adaptive matching algorithm. First, the region type is adaptively determined to
identify occluding, occluded, smooth and textured regions. Then, the matching
entropy criterion is used to adaptively select the size and shape of matching
windows, as well as the visible viewpoints. The two-step process can reduce
mismatches and redundant calculations by selecting effective matching windows.
The experimental results on synthetic and real data show that the proposed
method can effectively improve the accuracy of depth estimation in occlusion
and smooth regions and has strong robustness for different noise levels.
Therefore, high-precision depth estimation from 4D light field data is
achieved.

conventional BF and its variants that receive the same parameters for a whole
point cloud, LBF learns adaptive parameters for each point according its
geometric characteristic (e.g., corner, edge, plane), avoiding remnant noise,
wrongly-removed geometric details, and distorted shapes. Besides the learnable
paradigm of BF, we have two cores to facilitate LBF. First, different from the
local BF, LBF possesses a global-scale feature perception ability by exploiting
multi-scale patches of each point. Second, LBF formulates a geometry-aware
bi-directional projection loss, leading the denoising results to being faithful
to their underlying surfaces. Users can apply our LBF without any laborious
parameter tuning to achieve the optimal denoising results. Experiments show
clear improvements of LBF over its competitors on both synthetic and

individually, is a practical and an efficient method to obtain accurate

reduced individually, without taking their interconnections into account, the
effect on stability and accuracy of the resulting reduced-order interconnected

the accuracy of reduced-order linear-time invariant subsystem models and
(stability and accuracy of) resulting reduced-order interconnected linear

ways. Firstly, it can be used to translate accuracy characteristics of the

maximum proportion of channels being pruned, which is defined as Ratio of

removing inactive channels until reaching a knee point of performance decrease.
Simple methods for calculating the $S_C$ of trained models and resulted

manifests in poor convergence as well as high variance in outputs for certain

aim to shadow every pseudo-orbit, but only those which belong to a certain

The first criterion applies to a semilinear differential equation provided that
its linear part is hyperbolic and the nonlinearity is small in a neighborhood
of the prescribed set. The second criterion requires that the logarithmic norm
of the derivative of the right-hand side with respect to the state variable is
uniformly negative in a neighborhood of the prescribed set. The results are
applicable to important classes of model equations including the logistic

individual gain. One widely studied example, due to the conflict it poses
between human behaviour and game theoretic reasoning, is the Traveler's
Dilemma. The dilemma relies on the players' incentive to undercut their
opponent at the expense of losing a collective high payoff. Such individual
incentive leads players to a systematic mutual undercutting until the lowest
possible payoff is reached, which is the game's unique Nash equilibrium.
However, if players were satisfied with a high payoff -- that is not
necessarily higher than their opponent's -- they would both be better off
individually and collectively. Here, we explain how it is possible to converge
to this cooperative high payoff equilibrium. Our analysis focuses on
decomposing the dilemma into a local and a global game. We show that players
need to escape the local maximisation and jump to the global game, in order to
reach the cooperative equilibrium. Using a dynamic approach, based on
evolutionary game theory and learning theory models, we find that diversity,
understood as the presence of suboptimal strategies, is the general mechanism
that enables the jump towards cooperation.

fundamental task for RS image analysis and understanding. Recently,
transformer-based models demonstrated outstanding potential for learning
high-order contextual relationships from natural images with general resolution
(224x224 pixels) and achieved remarkable results on general image
classification tasks. However, the complexity of the naive transformer grows
quadratically with the increase in image size, which prevents transformer-based
models from VHR RS image (500x500 pixels) classification and other
computationally expensive downstream tasks. To this end, we propose to
decompose the expensive self-attention (SA) into real and imaginary parts via
discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and therefore propose an efficient complex
self-attention (CSA) mechanism. Benefiting from the conjugated symmetric
property of DFT, CSA is capable to model the high-order contextual information
with less than half computations of naive SA. To overcome the gradient
explosion in Fourier complex field, we replace the Softmax function with the
carefully designed Logmax function to normalize the attention map of CSA and
stabilize the gradient propagation. By stacking various layers of CSA blocks,
we propose the Fourier Complex Transformer (FCT) model to learn global
contextual information from VHR aerial images following the hierarchical
manners. Universal experiments conducted on commonly used RS classification
data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of FCT, especially on
very high-resolution RS images.

large security vendor. We answer questions such as How diverse is the feed?
Does it allow building malware datasets for different filetypes? How fresh are
the samples it provides? What is the distribution of malware families it sees?
Does that distribution really represent malware on user devices?
  We then explore how to perform threat hunting at scale by investigating
scalable approaches that can produce high purity clusters on the 235M feed

clustering (HAC), a more scalable HAC variant for TLSH digests (HAC-T), and a

However, only FVG scales to the daily influx of samples in the feed. Moreover,
FVG takes 15 hours to cluster the whole dataset of 235M samples. Finally, we
use the produced clusters for threat hunting, namely for detecting 190K samples

ResNets in conjunction with feature engineering. Although these ensembles can
achieve high accuracy, they also have a large footprint and require substantial
computational power reducing portability to devices with limited resources.
These drawbacks also mean that the previously proposed solutions are infeasible

hand, employing lighter feature-engineered systems can be laborious and add
further complexity making them difficult to create a deployable system quickly.

groups alternately ($n_1 = 24$, $n_2 = 31$) and by selecting the four most
challenging topics in college algebra, we measured their cognitive gains
quantitatively via a sequence of pre- and post-tests. Both groups improved
academically over time across all these four topics with statistically very
significant outcomes $(p < 0.001)$. Although they were not always statistically
significant ($p > 0.05$) in some topics, the post-test results suggest that
generally, the FCP trumps the CTM in cognitive gains, except for the first
topic on factorization, where the opposite is true with a very statistically
significant mean difference $(p < 0.001)$. By examining non-cognitive gains
qualitatively, we analyzed the students' feedback on the FCP and their
responses to a perception inventory. The finding suggests a favorable response
toward the FCP with primary improvements in the attitudes toward mathematics
and increased levels of cooperation among students. Since these students are so
happy to have control of their own learning, they were more relaxed, motivated,
confident, active, and responsible in learning under the FCP. We are confident

characterized by a spacetime geometry rapidly oscillating at frequencies that
depend on the axion mass $m_a$ [Brito {\it et~al.} (2015); Brito {\it et~al.}

by the cosmological expansion and, for any redshift value, $f_S + f_{2,G} =
f_{1,G}$ is found. Hippke (2019) showed that $f_{2,G}$ is spurious and
introduced by the data analysis procedure due to the nonrandom spacing of the
spectral absorption lines. This was not even found by Isaacson (2019) when
re-observed four of these stars with different instrumentation and data
reduction procedure. Interestingly, Hippke found $f_S$ in the solar spectrum
but not in the Kurucz (2005) artificial solar spectrum whilst its spectral
power estimated by Isaacson resulted below the accepted error $(1\%)$. From
these results, we discuss the validity of our ansatz by analyzing the common

frequencies are not real the oscillating axion core models is not valid.
Assuming, instead, the validity of $f_S$ from the results from the analysis of
the solar spectra, those oscillating modes may be transient modes favoring the

date (as low as 0.55 dB/cm at 925 nm wavelength) in single-mode silicon nitride
submicron waveguides (220x550 nm). This performance is achieved due to advanced
e-beam lithography and inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching steps
which yields waveguides vertical sidewalls with down to 0.85 nm sidewall
roughness. These results provide a chip-scale low-loss PIC platform that could
be even further improved with high quality SiO2 cladding, chemical-mechanical
polishing and multistep annealing for extra-strict single-photon applications.

dust-to-gas, and dust-to-metal. We use a sample of 18 large, spiral, face-on
DustPedia galaxies. All the SRs are moderate/strong correlations except the
dust-HI SR that does not exist or is weak for most galaxies. The SRs do not
have a universal form but each galaxy is characterized by distinct
correlations, affected by local processes and galaxy peculiarities. The SRs
hold starting from 0.3 kpc, and if a breaking down scale exists it is < 0.3
kpc. By evaluating all galaxies at 3.4 kpc, differences due to peculiarities of
individual galaxies are cancelled out and the corresponding SRs are consistent
with those of whole galaxies. By comparing subgalactic and global scales, the
most striking result emerges from the SRs involving ISM components: the
dust-total gas SR is a good correlation at all scales, while the dust-H2 and
dust-HI SRs are good correlations at subkpc/kpc and total scales, respectively.
For the other explored SRs, there is a good agreement between small and global
scales and this may support the picture where the main physical processes
regulating the properties and evolution of galaxies occur locally. Our results
are consistent with the hypothesis of self-regulation of the SF process. The
analysis of subgalactic ratios shows that they are consistent with those
derived for whole galaxies, from low to high z, supporting the idea that also
these ratios could be set by local processes. Our results highlight the
heterogeneity of galaxy properties and the importance of resolved studies on
local galaxies in the context of galaxy evolution. They also provide
observational constraints to theoretical models and updated references for

identify unknown objects in a dynamic world, which has achieved significant
attentions. However, previous approaches only consider this problem in
data-abundant conditions, while neglecting the few-shot scenes. In this paper,
we seek a solution for the few-shot open-set object detection (FSOSOD), which
aims to quickly train a detector based on few samples while detecting all known
classes and identifying unknown classes. The main challenge for this task is
that few training samples induce the model to overfit on the known classes,
resulting in a poor open-set performance. We propose a new FSOSOD algorithm to
tackle this issue, named Few-shOt Open-set Detector (FOOD), which contains a
novel class weight sparsification classifier (CWSC) and a novel unknown
decoupling learner (UDL). To prevent over-fitting, CWSC randomly sparses parts
of the normalized weights for the logit prediction of all classes, and then
decreases the co-adaptability between the class and its neighbors. Alongside,
UDL decouples training the unknown class and enables the model to form a
compact unknown decision boundary. Thus, the unknown objects can be identified
with a confidence probability without any pseudo-unknown samples for training.
We compare our method with several state-of-the-art OSOD methods in few-shot
scenes and observe that our method improves the recall of unknown classes by
5%-9% across all shots in VOC-COCO dataset setting.

under mild assumptions the universal adversarial example game lacks a pure Nash

(UADs) which only fix a universal direction for adversarial perturbations and
allow the perturbations' magnitude to be chosen freely across samples. We prove
that the UAD adversarial example game can possess a Nash equilibrium with a
pure UAD strategy, implying the potential transferability of UADs. We also
connect the UAD optimization problem to the well-known principal component

mitigate these issues is by performing battery thermal preconditioning, which
increases the energy efficiency of the battery. However, to optimally perform
battery thermal preconditioning, the vehicle usage pattern needs to be known,

detectors to filter out the heralding events where more than one photon pair is
created. Here, we demonstrate the use of a high-efficiency PNR superconducting
nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) as a heralding detector for a HSPS. By
filtering out higher-order heralding detections, we can reduce the $g^{(2)}(0)$
of the heralded single photon by $(26.6 \pm 0.2)\,\%$, or alternatively, for a
fixed pump power, increasing the heralding rate by a factor of $1.363 \pm
0.004$ for a fixed $g^{(2)}(0)$. Additionally, we use the detector to directly
measure the photon-number distribution of a thermal mode and calculate the
unheralded $g^{(2)}(0)$. We show the possibility to perform $g^{(2)}(0)$
measurements with only one PNR detector, with the results in agreement with
those obtained by more common-place techniques which use multiple threshold

a type of novel generalized spatial modulation (GSM) constellations, referred
to as SSERGSM constellations, so as to boost the performance of the BICGSM-ID

further design a family of rate-compatible P-LDPC codes, referred to as
enhanced accumulate-repeat-accumulate (EARA) codes, which possess both
excellent decoding thresholds and linear-minimum-distance-growth property. Both
analysis and simulation results illustrate that the proposed SSERGSM

continua (beams) with six local degrees of freedom, three positional and three
rotational ones. A kinematically consistent 1D-2D coupling scheme for this

freedom along the beams. The positional degrees of freedom are coupled by
enforcing a constant normal distance between a point on the beam centerline and
a corresponding point on the solid surface. This strategy requires a consistent
description of the solid surface normal vector field to guarantee fundamental
mechanical properties such as conservation of angular momentum. Coupling of the
rotational degrees of freedom of the beams and a suitable rotation tensor
representative for the local orientation within a Boltzmann continuum has been
considered in a previous contribution. In the present work, this coupling
approach will be extended by constructing rotation tensors that are
representative for local surface orientations. Several numerical examples
demonstrate the consistency, robustness and accuracy of the proposed method. To
showcase its applicability to multi-physics systems of practical relevance, the
fluid-structure interaction example of a vascular stent is presented.

cosmic structure formation (KFT) allows to accurately calculate the non-linear
power spectrum of cosmic density fluctuations up to wave numbers of
$k\lesssim10\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at redshift zero. Cosmology and gravity
enter this calculation via two functions, viz. the background expansion
function and possibly a time-dependent modification of the gravitational

  The success of the cosmological standard model based on general relativity
suggests that cosmological models in generalized theories of gravity should
have observable effects differing only weakly from those in standard cosmology.
Based on this assumption, we derive the functional, first-order Taylor

deep learning algorithms to learn Green's functions associated with linear
partial differential equations and rigorously justify PDE learning techniques.
A theoretically rigorous algorithm is derived to obtain a learning rate, which
characterizes the amount of training data needed to approximately learn Green's
functions associated with elliptic PDEs. The construction connects the fields
of PDE learning and numerical linear algebra by extending the randomized
singular value decomposition to non-standard Gaussian vectors and
Hilbert--Schmidt operators, and exploiting the low-rank hierarchical structure
of Green's functions using hierarchical matrices. Rational neural networks
(NNs) are introduced and consist of neural networks with trainable rational
activation functions. The highly compositional structure of these networks,
combined with rational approximation theory, implies that rational functions
have higher approximation power than standard activation functions. In
addition, rational NNs may have poles and take arbitrarily large values, which
is ideal for approximating functions with singularities such as Green's
functions. Finally, theoretical results on Green's functions and rational NNs
are combined to design a human-understandable deep learning method for
discovering Green's functions from data. This approach complements
state-of-the-art PDE learning techniques, as a wide range of physics can be
captured from the learned Green's functions such as dominant modes, symmetries,
and singularity locations.

this paper how this data-centric approach can be facilitated in a decentralized
manner to enable efficient data collection for algorithms. Face detectors are a
class of models that suffer heavily from bias issues as they have to work on a
large variety of different data. We also propose a face detection and
anonymization approach using a hybrid MultiTask Cascaded CNN with FaceNet
Embeddings to benchmark multiple datasets to describe and evaluate the bias in
the models towards different ethnicities, gender, and age groups along with
ways to enrich fairness in a decentralized system of data labeling, correction,
and verification by users to create a robust pipeline for model retraining.

robots with unprecedented functionalities. Specifically, we demonstrate a
sensor-less metacap gripper that can grasp objects in 3.75 ms upon physical

that have little dependence on the rate of input. Both grippers can be readily
integrated into a robotic platform for practical applications. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the metacap enables propelling of a swimming robot, exhibiting
amplified swimming speed as well as untethered, electronics-free swimming with
tunable speeds. Our metacaps provide new strategies to design the
next-generation soft robots that require high transient output energy and are
capable of autonomous and electronics-free maneuvering.

the power of PLMs. There are two sub-tasks: overall assessment of phrase break
for a speech clip; fine-grained assessment of every possible phrase break
position. Speech input is first force-aligned with texts, then pre-processed to
a token sequence, including words and associated phrase break information. The
token sequence is then fed into the pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline. In
pre-training, a replaced break token detection module is trained with token
data where each token has a certain percentage chance to be randomly replaced.
In fine-tuning, overall and fine-grained scoring are optimized with text
classification and sequence labeling pipeline, respectively. With the
introduction of PLMs, the dependence on labeled training data has been greatly
reduced, and performance has improved.

include text conditional diffusion model and cross-modal guided diffusion

generation respectively. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
approach, namely UPainting, to unify simple and complex scene image generation,
as shown in Figure 1. Based on architecture improvements and diverse guidance
schedules, UPainting effectively integrates cross-modal guidance from a
pretrained image-text matching model into a text conditional diffusion model
that utilizes a pretrained Transformer language model as the text encoder. Our
key findings is that combining the power of large-scale Transformer language
model in understanding language and image-text matching model in capturing
cross-modal semantics and style, is effective to improve sample fidelity and
image-text alignment of image generation. In this way, UPainting has a more
general image generation capability, which can generate images of both simple
and complex scenes more effectively. To comprehensively compare text-to-image
models, we further create a more general benchmark, UniBench, with well-written
Chinese and English prompts in both simple and complex scenes. We compare
UPainting with recent models and find that UPainting greatly outperforms other
models in terms of caption similarity and image fidelity in both simple and
complex scenes. UPainting project page \url{https://upainting.github.io/}.

fine-tuning process, the pre-trained models are frozen, and only lightweight
modules inserted in each Transformer block are trainable (a method known as
adapters). Moreover, to boost the performance in a cross-language low-resource
scenario, the Transformer model is further tuned on a large intermediate

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Our approach considers anomalies as
abnormal patterns that deviate from their surroundings but without any prior
knowledge of their characteristics. In the literature, most model-based
algorithms face three main issues. First, the speckle noise corrupts the image
and potentially leads to numerous false detections. Second, statistical
approaches may exhibit deficiencies in modeling spatial correlation in SAR
images. Finally, neural networks based on supervised learning approaches are
not recommended due to the lack of annotated SAR data, notably for the class of
abnormal patterns. Our proposed method aims to address these issues through a
self-supervised algorithm. The speckle is first removed through the deep
learning SAR2SAR algorithm. Then, an adversarial autoencoder is trained to
reconstruct an anomaly-free SAR image. Finally, a change detection processing
step is applied between the input and the output to detect anomalies.
Experiments are performed to show the advantages of our method compared to the
conventional Reed-Xiaoli algorithm, highlighting the importance of an efficient
despeckling pre-processing step.

Processors (ISPs) and noise characteristics of image sensors. Instead, we
propose a noise-accounted RAW image augmentation method. In essence, color
jitter and blur augmentation are applied to a RAW image before applying
non-linear ISP, resulting in realistic intensity. Furthermore, we introduce a
noise amount alignment method that calibrates the domain gap in the noise
property caused by the augmentation. We show that our proposed noise-accounted
RAW augmentation method doubles the image recognition accuracy in challenging
environments only with simple training data.

analysis with nanometer to angstrom-scale resolution, however, the accurate
simulation of particular TERS signals remains a computational challenge. We
present a unique approach to this challenge by combining the two main
contributors to plasmon-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and to the high resolution
in TERS in particular, the electromagnetic and the chemical effect, into one
quantum mechanical simulation. The electromagnetic effect describes the
sample's interaction with the strong, highly localized and inhomogeneous
electric fields associated with the plasmonic tip, and is typically the
thematic focus for most mechanistic studies. On the other hand, the chemical
effect covers the different responses to the extremely close-range and highly
position-sensitive chemical interaction between the apex tip atom(s) and the
sample, and, as we could show in previous works, plays an often underestimated
role. Starting from a (time-dependent) density functional theory description of
the chemical model system, comprised of a tin(II) phthalocyanine (SnPc) sample
molecule and a single silver atom as tip, we introduce the electromagnetic
effect through a series of point charges that recreate the electric field in
the vicinity of the plasmonic Ag nanoparticle. By scanning the tip over the
molecule along a 3D grid, we can investigate the system's Raman response on
each position for non-resonant and resonant illumination. Simulating both
effects on their own already hints at the achievable signal enhancement and
resolution, but the combination of both creates even stronger evidence that
TERS is capable of resolving sub-molecular features.

is based on the method of compact groups of inhomogeneities applied to a model
system of hard-core-penetrable-shell particles embedded together with the base
liquid in a uniform host of the conductivity. The cores represent the
particles. The shells are electrically inhomogeneous in the radial direction,
their conductivity profile being a continuous function. This model is possible
to analyze rigorously in the static limit. The desired conductivity is found
from the integral relation which allows us to express the electrical
conductivity in the terms of the zeta-potential, thickness of the stagnant
layer, matrix molarity, etc. The theory reveals the existence of different
scenarios of behavior of the conductivity depending on the geometrical and
electrical parameters of the stagnant layer. It is shown that the functional
dependence between the thickness and zeta-potential can be obtained from the
rate of change of the conductivity with concentration for diluted suspensions;
this rate can be measured experimentally. It is pointed out that the
hydrodynamic radius of a nanoparticle can be obtained from the
Smoluchowski-Einstein diffusion coefficient, which can be measured by the
method of laser correlation spectroscopy. In order to find the zeta-potential,
it is necessary to simultaneously do a series of independent measurements: find
the slope of the conductivity and estimate the thickness of the stagnant layer.

rabbit would look like? In this work, we attempt to answer these questions by
exploring a new task called semantic mixing, aiming at blending two different
semantics to create a new concept (e.g., corgi + coffee machine -- >
corgi-alike coffee machine). Unlike style transfer, where an image is stylized
according to the reference style without changing the image content, semantic
blending mixes two different concepts in a semantic manner to synthesize a
novel concept while preserving the spatial layout and geometry. To this end, we
present MagicMix, a simple yet effective solution based on pre-trained
text-conditioned diffusion models. Motivated by the progressive generation
property of diffusion models where layout/shape emerges at early denoising
steps while semantically meaningful details appear at later steps during the
denoising process, our method first obtains a coarse layout (either by
corrupting an image or denoising from a pure Gaussian noise given a text
prompt), followed by injection of conditional prompt for semantic mixing. Our
method does not require any spatial mask or re-training, yet is able to
synthesize novel objects with high fidelity. To improve the mixing quality, we
further devise two simple strategies to provide better control and flexibility
over the synthesized content. With our method, we present our results over
diverse downstream applications, including semantic style transfer, novel
object synthesis, breed mixing, and concept removal, demonstrating the

Measuring the shrinkage of the orbits will allow for the tidal quality

parameter to obtain information about stellar interiors. We analyse data from
TESS for two targets known to host close-in hot Jupiters, WASP-18 and WASP-19,
to measure the current limits on orbital period variation and provide new

two orders of magnitude higher than that of WASP-12, while WASP-19 has a
minimum value one order of magnitude higher, which is consistent with other
similar targets. Further observations are required to constrain the orbital

arbitrary mental spaces via place and grid cells can serve as a representation
of memories and experiences and their relations to each other. The multi-scale
successor representation is proposed to be the mathematical principle
underlying place and grid cell computations. Here, we present a neural network,
which learns a cognitive map of a semantic space based on 32 different animal
species encoded as feature vectors. The neural network successfully learns the
similarities between different animal species, and constructs a cognitive map
of 'animal space' based on the principle of successor representations with an
accuracy of around 30% which is near to the theoretical maximum regarding the
fact that all animal species have more than one possible successor, i.e.
nearest neighbor in feature space. Furthermore, a hierarchical structure, i.e.
different scales of cognitive maps, can be modeled based on multi-scale
successor representations. We find that, in fine-grained cognitive maps, the
animal vectors are evenly distributed in feature space. In contrast, in
coarse-grained maps, animal vectors are highly clustered according to their
biological class, i.e. amphibians, mammals and insects. This could be a
possible mechanism explaining the emergence of new abstract semantic concepts.
Finally, even completely new or incomplete input can be represented by
interpolation of the representations from the cognitive map with remarkable
high accuracy of up to 95%. We conclude that the successor representation can
serve as a weighted pointer to past memories and experiences, and may therefore
be a crucial building block for future machine learning to include prior
knowledge, and to derive context knowledge from novel input.

Monte Carlo radiative transfer. It allows one to simulate temperature
distributions as well as images and spectral energy distributions of the
scattered light and thermal reemission radiation for variable illuminating and
heating sources embedded in dust distributions, such as circumstellar disks and
dust shells on time scales up to weeks.
  Methods. We extended the publicly available 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer
code POLARIS with efficient methods for the simulation of temperature
distributions, scattering, and thermal reemission of dust distributions
illuminated by temporally variable radiation sources. The influence of the
chosen temporal step width and the number of photon packages per time step as
key parameters for a given configuration is shown by simulating the temperature
distribution in a spherical envelope around an embedded central star. The
effect of the optical depth on the temperature simulation is discussed for the
spherical envelope as well as for a model of a circumstellar disk with an
embedded star. Finally, we present simulations of an outburst of a star
surrounded by a circumstellar disk.
  Results. The presented algorithm for time-dependent 3D continuum Monte Carlo
radiative transfer is a valuable basis for preparatory studies as well as for
the analysis of continuum observations of the dusty environment around variable
sources, such as accreting young stellar objects. In particular, the combined
study of light echos in the optical and near-infrared wavelength range and the
corresponding time-dependent thermal reemission observables of variable, for
example outbursting sources, becomes possible on all involved spatial scales.

Stiefel manifold. The state-of-the-art methods for solving the problem are
subgradient methods and semidefinite relaxation based methods. However, these
two types of methods have their obvious limitations and thus are only suitable
for efficiently solving the FPCA problem in very special scenarios. The goal of
this paper is to develop efficient algorithms for solving the FPCA problem in
general settings, especially the very high-dimensional setting. In this paper,
we first transform the problem into a smooth non-convex concave minimax
optimization over the Stiefel manifold. Then we propose an alternating
Riemannian gradient (ARG) algorithm, which performs a Riemannian gradient
descent step and an ordinary gradient projection step at each iteration, for
solving the general non-convex concave minimax problems over Riemannian
manifolds. We prove that ARG can find an $\varepsilon$-stationary point of the
above problem within $O(\varepsilon^{-4})$ iterations. Simulation results show
that, compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our proposed ARG algorithm
can achieve better performance in terms of the solution quality and speed for
solving the FPCA problems arising from signal processing and machine learning.

Understanding tasks is a topic with rapidly increasing interest in the NLP
community. Spurious statistical correlations in the data allow models to
perform shortcuts and avoid uncovering more advanced and desirable linguistic
features. A multitude of effective debiasing approaches has been proposed, but
flexibility remains a major issue. For the most part, models must be retrained
to find a new set of weights with debiased behavior. We propose a new debiasing
method in which we identify debiased pruning masks that can be applied to a
finetuned model. This enables the selective and conditional application of
debiasing behaviors. We assume that bias is caused by a certain subset of
weights in the network; our method is, in essence, a mask search to identify
and remove biased weights. Our masks show equivalent or superior performance to
the standard counterparts, while offering important benefits. Pruning masks can
be stored with high efficiency in memory, and it becomes possible to switch
among several debiasing behaviors (or revert back to the original biased model)
at inference time. Finally, it opens the doors to further research on how
biases are acquired by studying the generated masks. For example, we observed
that the early layers and attention heads were pruned more aggressively,
possibly hinting towards the location in which biases may be encoded.

thanks to the achievable high angular resolution and low hardware complexity.
Further, wireless localization is likely to take place in the radiating
near-field (Fresnel) region, which provides new degrees of freedom, because of
the adoption of arrays with large apertures. While current studies mostly focus
on the use of costly fully-digital antenna arrays, in this paper we investigate
how DMAs can be applied for near-field localization of a single user. We use a
direct positioning estimation method based on curvature-of-arrival of the
impinging wavefront to obtain the user location, and characterize the effects
of DMA tuning on the estimation accuracy. Next, we propose an algorithm for
configuring the DMA to optimize near-field localization, by first tuning the
adjustable DMA coefficients to minimize the estimation error using postulated
knowledge of the actual user position. Finally, we propose a sub-optimal
iterative algorithm that does not rely on such knowledge. Simulation results
show that the DMA-based near-field localization accuracy could approach that of
fully-digital arrays at lower cost.

localization (CL) from the perspective of Kalman decomposition, which
decomposes the observable and unobservable states and allows treating them
individually. The factors causing the dimension reduction of the unobservable
subspace, termed error discrepancy items, are explicitly isolated and
identified in the state propagation and measurement Jacobians for the first
time. We prove that the error discrepancy items lead to the global orientation
being erroneously observable, which in turn causes the state estimation to be
inconsistent. A CL algorithm, called Kalman decomposition-based EKF (KD-EKF),
is proposed to improve consistency. The key idea is to perform state estimation
using the Kalman observable canonical form in the transformed coordinates. By
annihilating the error discrepancy items, proper observability properties are
guaranteed. More importantly, the modified state propagation and measurement
Jacobians are exactly equivalent to linearizing the nonlinear CL system at
current best state estimates. Consequently, the inconsistency caused by the
erroneous dimension reduction of the unobservable subspace is completely
eliminated. The KD-EKF CL algorithm has been extensively verified in both Monte
Carlo simulations and real-world experiments and shown to achieve better
performance than state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and
consistency.

the density varies continuously from a uniform interior (with density
$\rho_{\rm i}$) to a uniform exterior on either side (with density $\rho_{\rm

The continuous structuring and oblique propagation make our study new relative
to pertinent studies, and lead to wave damping via the Alfv$\acute{\rm e}$n

eigenmodes, and isolate the effects of system asymmetry by varying $\rho_{\rm

$\rho_{\rm i}/\rho_{\rm R}$-dependence as a result of the difference between
the two Alfv$\acute{\rm e}$n continua, and resonant absorption occurs only in
one continuum when $\rho_{\rm i}/\rho_{\rm R}$ is below some threshold. We also
find that the system asymmetry results in two qualitatively different regimes
for the phase and group diagrams. The phase and group trajectories lie
essentially on the same side (different sides) relative to the equilibrium
magnetic field when the configuration is not far from a ``Fully Asymmetric''

different semi-analytical tools together, we study the dynamics and high-energy

applied analytical adiabatic and radiative models to compute the variable

induces stochastic hour-timescale variations in the geometry of the two-wind

convergence can be given. In this paper, we study a recently developed circular

global trajectory generation by adapting an artificial magnetic field such that
multiple trajectories around obstacles can be evaluated. In particular, we
provide a mathematically rigorous analysis of this planner in a planar
environment to ensure safe motion of the controlled robot. Contrary to existing
results, the derived collision avoidance analysis covers the entire CF motion
planning algorithm including attractive forces for goal convergence and is not
limited to a specific choice of the rotation field, i.e., our guarantees are
not limited to a specific potentially suboptimal trajectory. Our Lyapunov-type
collision avoidance analysis is based on the definition of an (equivalent)
two-dimensional auxiliary system, which enables us to provide tight, if and

Furthermore, we show how this analysis naturally extends to multiple obstacles
and we specify sufficient conditions for goal convergence. Finally, we provide

considering different types of measurements. We choose a sample of $49, 911$

study the dependence of the fraction of red galaxies on different measures of
the local environment as well as the large-scale ""geometric"" environment
defined by density gradients in the surround- ing cosmic web. We find that the
red galaxy fraction varies with the environment at fixed stellar mass. The red
fraction depends more strongly on local environmental measures than on
large-scale geometric environment measures. By comparing the different
environmental densities, we show that no density measurement fully explains the
observed environmental red fraction variation, suggesting the different
measures of environmental density contain different information. We test
whether the local environmental measures, when combined together, can explain
all the observed environmental red fraction variation. The geometric
environment has a small residual effect, and this effect is larger for voids
than any other type of geometric environment. This could provide a test of the
physics applied to cosmological-scale galaxy evolution simulations as it
combines large-scale effects with local environmental impact.

verifiable correctness, robustness, and interpretability of AI systems.
Existing specifications for neural networks are in the paradigm of data as
specification. That is, the local neighborhood centering around a reference
input is considered to be correct (or robust). While existing specifications
contribute to verifying adversarial robustness, a significant problem in many
research domains, our empirical study shows that those verified regions are
somewhat tight, and thus fail to allow verification of test set inputs, making
them impractical for some real-world applications. To this end, we propose a
new family of specifications called neural representation as specification,
which uses the intrinsic information of neural networks - neural activation
patterns (NAPs), rather than input data to specify the correctness and/or
robustness of neural network predictions. We present a simple statistical
approach to mining neural activation patterns. To show the effectiveness of
discovered NAPs, we formally verify several important properties, such as
various types of misclassifications will never happen for a given NAP, and
there is no ambiguity between different NAPs. We show that by using NAP, we can
verify a significant region of the input space, while still recalling 84% of
the data on MNIST. Moreover, we can push the verifiable bound to 10 times
larger on the CIFAR10 benchmark. Thus, we argue that NAPs can potentially be
used as a more reliable and extensible specification for neural network
verification.

which are crafted by adding imperceptible perturbations on benign face images.
The existence of adversarial face examples poses a great threat to the security
of society. In order to build a more sustainable digital nation, in this paper,
we improve the transferability of adversarial face examples to expose more
blind spots of existing FR models. Though generating hard samples has shown its
effectiveness in improving the generalization of models in training tasks, the
effectiveness of utilizing this idea to improve the transferability of
adversarial face examples remains unexplored. To this end, based on the
property of hard samples and the symmetry between training tasks and
adversarial attack tasks, we propose the concept of hard models, which have
similar effects as hard samples for adversarial attack tasks. Utilizing the
concept of hard models, we propose a novel attack method called Beneficial
Perturbation Feature Augmentation Attack (BPFA), which reduces the overfitting
of adversarial examples to surrogate FR models by constantly generating new
hard models to craft the adversarial examples. Specifically, in the
backpropagation, BPFA records the gradients on pre-selected feature maps and
uses the gradient on the input image to craft the adversarial example. In the
next forward propagation, BPFA leverages the recorded gradients to add
beneficial perturbations on their corresponding feature maps to increase the
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BPFA can significantly boost the
transferability of adversarial attacks on FR.

  Multi-layer Representation and Collaborative Reasoning","Accepted at IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications",,,,"cs.AI cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semantic communication has recently attracted significant interest from both
industry and academia due to its potential to transform the existing
data-focused communication architecture towards a more generally intelligent
and goal-oriented semantic-aware networking system. Despite its promising
potential, semantic communications and semantic-aware networking are still at
their infancy. Most existing works focus on transporting and delivering the
explicit semantic information, e.g., labels or features of objects, that can be
directly identified from the source signal. The original definition of
semantics as well as recent results in cognitive neuroscience suggest that it
is the implicit semantic information, in particular the hidden relations
connecting different concepts and feature items that plays the fundamental role
in recognizing, communicating, and delivering the real semantic meanings of
messages. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel reasoning-based
implicit semantic-aware communication network architecture that allows multiple
tiers of CDC and edge servers to collaborate and support efficient semantic
encoding, decoding, and interpretation for end-users. We introduce a new
multi-layer representation of semantic information taking into consideration
both the hierarchical structure of implicit semantics as well as the
personalized inference preference of individual users. We model the semantic
reasoning process as a reinforcement learning process and then propose an
imitation-based semantic reasoning mechanism learning (iRML) solution for the
edge servers to leaning a reasoning policy that imitates the inference behavior
of the source user. A federated GCN-based collaborative reasoning solution is
proposed to allow multiple edge servers to jointly construct a shared semantic
interpretation model based on decentralized knowledge datasets.

Our approach couples a one-dimensional compaction model, providing the dynamics
of the evolution of porosity, temperature and pressure along the vertical
direction, with a chemical model able to quantify the partial pressure of CO2
resulting from minerals and pore water interaction. The modeling framework we
propose allows (i) estimating the depth at which the source of gases is located
and (ii) quantifying the amount of CO2 generated, based on the mineralogy of
the sediments involved in the basin formation process. A distinctive objective
of the study is the quantification of the way the uncertainty affecting
chemical equilibrium constants propagates to model outputs, i.e., the flux of
CO2. These parameters are considered as key sources of uncertainty in our
modeling approach because temperature and pressure distributions associated
with deep burial depths typically fall outside the range of validity of
commonly employed geochemical databases and typically used geochemical
software. We also analyze the impact of the relative abundancy of primary
phases in the sediments on the activation of CCR processes. As a test bed, we
consider a computational study where pressure and temperature conditions are
representative of those observed in real sedimentary formation. Our results are
conducive to the probabilistic assessment of (i) the characteristic pressure
and temperature at which CCR leads to generation of CO2 in sedimentary systems,
(ii) the order of magnitude of the CO2 generation rate that can be associated
with CCR processes.

  Materials and Methods: We implement and assess 3 different `Hiding in Plain

replacement strategy, a Random replacement strategy and a novel Markov
model-based strategy. We evaluate the privacy preserving benefits of these
strategies on a synthetic PHI distribution and real clinical corpora from 2
different institutions using a range of false negative error rates (FNER).
  Results: Using FNER ranging from 0.1% to 5% PHI leakage at the document level
could be reduced from 27.1% to 0.1% (0.1% FNER) and from 94.2% to 57.7% (5%
FNER) utilizing the Markov chain strategy versus the Consistent strategy on a

Birmingham (UAB). The Markov chain substitution strategy also consistently
outperformed the Consistent and Random substitution strategies in a MIMIC
corpus of discharge summaries and on a range of synthetic clinical PHI
distributions. Discussion: We demonstrate that a Markov chain surrogate
generation strategy substantially reduces the chance of inadvertent PHI release
across a range of assumed PHI FNER and release our implementation

  Conclusion: The Markov chain replacement strategy allows for the release of
larger de-identified corpora at the same risk level relative to corpora
released using a consistent HIPS strategy.

the ejection remains unknown. Different mechanisms have been proposed as
responsible for this mass ejection but so far little is known about the actual
processes taking place in these objects.
  Here we present high angular resolution interferometric ALMA maps of VY CMa
continuum and molecular emission, which resolve the structure of the ejecta
with unprecedented detail. The study of the molecular emission from the ejecta
around evolved stars has been shown to be an essential tool in determining the
characteristics of the mass loss ejections. Our aim is thus to use the
information provided by these observations to understand the ejections
undergone by VY CMa and to determine their possible origins.
  We inspected the kinematics of molecular emission observed. We obtained
position-velocity diagrams and reconstructed the 3D structure of the gas traced
by the different species. It allowed us to study the morphology and kinematics
of the gas traced by the different species surrounding VY CMa.
  Two types of ejecta are clearly observed: extended, irregular, and vast
ejecta surrounding the star that are carved by localized fast outflows. The
structure of the outflows is found to be particularly flat. We present a 3D
reconstruction of these outflows and proof of the carving. This indicates that
two different mass loss processes take place in this massive star. We
tentatively propose the physical cause for the formation of both types of
structures. These results provide essential information on the mass loss
processes of RSGs and thus of their further evolution.

Pareto-dominates existing certificates on both image segmentation and node

in deep learning (DL) has shown their promising potential in COPD
identification from CT images. However, with heterogeneous syndromes and
distinct phenotypes, DL models trained with CTs from one data center fail to
generalize on images from another center. Due to privacy regularizations, a
collaboration of distributed CT images into one centralized center is not
feasible. Federated learning (FL) approaches enable us to train with
distributed private data. Yet, routine FL solutions suffer from performance
degradation in the case where COPD CTs are not independent and identically

personalize some heads in multiheaded self-attention layers to learn the
personalized attention for local data and retain the other heads shared to

grammars (CFG), yet such formalisms are not sufficiently expressive for human
languages. Combinatory Categorial Grammars (CCGs) are sufficiently expressive

test between variants of CCG that differ in how they handle optional adjuncts.
These evaluations are carried out against a baseline that includes estimates of
next-word predictability from a Transformer neural network language model. Such
a comparison reveals unique contributions of CCG structure-building
predominantly in the left posterior temporal lobe: CCG-derived measures offer a
superior fit to neural signals compared to those derived from a CFG. These
effects are spatially distinct from bilateral superior temporal effects that
are unique to predictability. Neural effects for structure-building are thus
separable from predictability during naturalistic listening, and those effects
are best characterized by a grammar whose expressive power is motivated on

density-stratified fluids is a central problem in geophysical fluid dynamics.
While isotropic overturning regions are commonly the focus of mixing analyses,
we here investigate whether significant mixing may arise in anisotropic
statically-stable regions of the flow. Focusing on a single forced direct
numerical simulation of stratified turbulence, we analyze spatial correlations
between the vertical density gradient $\partial\rho/\partial z$ and the
dissipation rates of kinetic energy $\epsilon$ and scalar variance $\chi$, the
latter quantifying scalar mixing. The domain is characterized by relatively
well-mixed density layers separated by sharp stable interfaces that are
correlated with high vertical shear. While static instability is most prevalent
within the mixed layers, much of the scalar mixing is localized to the
intervening interfaces, a phenomenon not apparent if considering local static
instability or $\epsilon$ alone. While the majority of the domain is
characterized by the canonical flux coefficient
$\Gamma\equiv\chi/\epsilon=0.2$, often assumed in ocean mixing
parameterizations, extreme values of $\chi$ within the statically-stable
interfaces, associated with elevated $\Gamma$, strongly skew the bulk
statistics. Our findings suggest that current parameterizations of turbulent
mixing may be biased by undersampling, such that the most common, but not
necessarily the most significant, mixing events are overweighted. Having
focused here on a single simulation of stratified turbulence, it is hoped that
our results motivate a broader investigation into the role played by stable
density interfaces in mixing, across a wider range of parameters and forcing
schemes representative of ocean turbulence.

hydrogen protons align to give a total nuclear spin of 0 or 1.The equilibrium
ratio of 3:1 is established slowly in freshly evaporated water vapour and the
isomers then behave distinct gasses, with their own partial pressures.
Magnetic-field-induced ortho to para transformations are expected to alter the
evaporation rate.
  Experiment. Evaporation from beakers of deionized water and a 6 M solution of
urea is monitored simultaneously for periods from 1 to 60 hours with and
without a 500 mT magnetic field, while logging the ambient temperature and
humidity. The balances with the two beakers are shielded in the same Perspex
container. Many runs have been conducted over a two-year period.
  Findings. The evaporation rate of water is found to increase by 12 % of in
the field but that of water in urea solution decreases by 28 6 %. Two effects
are at play. One is dephasing of the Larmor precession of adjacent protons on a
water molecule in a field gradient, which tends to equalize the isomer
populations. The other is Lorentz stress on the moving charge dipole, which can
increase the proportion of the ortho isomer. From analysis of the time and
field dependence of the evaporation, we infer an ortho fraction of 39 % in

transformation form can in particular be used to derive important moment
identities for the weight distribution of codes. In this paper, we focus on

matrices, and the distance between two matrices is the skew rank metric, which
is half the rank of their difference. This paper develops a $q$-analog
MacWilliams Identity in the form of a functional transformation for codes based

introduces a skew-$q$ algebra and uses generalised Krawtchouk polynomials.
Based on this new MacWilliams Identity, we then derive several moments of the

compare representations of a network's different layers, of architecturally
similar networks trained differently, or of models with different architectures
trained on the same data. A wide variety of conclusions about similarity and
dissimilarity of these various representations have been made using CKA. In
this work we present analysis that formally characterizes CKA sensitivity to a
large class of simple transformations, which can naturally occur in the context
of modern machine learning. This provides a concrete explanation of CKA
sensitivity to outliers, which has been observed in past works, and to
transformations that preserve the linear separability of the data, an important

CKA similarity metric, demonstrating situations in which it gives unexpected or
counter-intuitive results. Finally we study approaches for modifying
representations to maintain functional behaviour while changing the CKA value.
Our results illustrate that, in many cases, the CKA value can be easily

elements from iron to lead, and characterizing gamma rays induced by muon
nuclear capture. On-target beamspots were characterized with a dedicated

photopeak efficiency of $\overline{\epsilon_E}$ =0.11% and an energy resolution
of $\overline{\sigma_E}$ = 0.8 keV at E=1000 keV. The overall performance of
the GIANT setup at S$\mu$S allowed to start a rich user program with

peak AoI (PAoI), violation probabilities and distributions of AoI and PAoI
characterize the timeliness in more details. This paper studies the timeliness
of the IoT-based multi-source status update system. By modeling the system as a
multi-source M/G/1/1 bufferless preemptive queue, general formulas of violation
probabilities and probability density functions (p.d.f.s) of AoI and PAoI are
derived with a time-domain approach. For the case with negativeexponentially

in closed form. Moreover, the maximal violation probabilities of AoI and PAoI
are proposed to characterize the overall timeliness. To improve the overall

allocation scheme is used to minimize the maximal violation probabilities. It
is proved that the optimal arrival rates can be found by convex optimization
algorithms. In addition, it is obtained that the minimum of maximal violation

  Concept over Nash Equilibria",,,,,"cs.GT cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multiagent learning settings are inherently more difficult than single-agent
learning because each agent interacts with other simultaneously learning agents
in a shared environment. An effective approach in multiagent reinforcement
learning is to consider the learning process of agents and influence their
future policies toward desirable behaviors from each agent's perspective.
Importantly, if each agent maximizes its long-term rewards by accounting for
the impact of its behavior on the set of convergence policies, the resulting
multiagent system reaches an active equilibrium. While this new solution
concept is general such that standard solution concepts, such as a Nash
equilibrium, are special cases of active equilibria, it is unclear when an
active equilibrium is a preferred equilibrium over other solution concepts. In
this paper, we analyze active equilibria from a game-theoretic perspective by
closely studying examples where Nash equilibria are known. By directly
comparing active equilibria to Nash equilibria in these examples, we find that
active equilibria find more effective solutions than Nash equilibria,
concluding that an active equilibrium is the desired solution for multiagent
learning settings.

  for Multistation Assembly Systems",,,,,"stat.AP cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper addresses the problem of fault diagnosis in multistation assembly
systems. Fault diagnosis is to identify process faults that cause the excessive
dimensional variation of the product using dimensional measurements. For such
problems, the challenge is solving an underdetermined system caused by a common
phenomenon in practice; namely, the number of measurements is less than that of
the process errors. To address this challenge, this paper attempts to solve the
following two problems: (1) how to utilize the temporal correlation in the time
series data of each process error and (2) how to apply prior knowledge
regarding which process errors are more likely to be process faults. A novel
sparse Bayesian learning method is proposed to achieve the above objectives.
The method consists of three hierarchical layers. The first layer has
parameterized prior distribution that exploits the temporal correlation of each
process error. Furthermore, the second and third layers achieve the prior
distribution representing the prior knowledge of process faults. Then, these
prior distributions are updated with the likelihood function of the measurement
samples from the process, resulting in the accurate posterior distribution of
process faults from an underdetermined system. Since posterior distributions of
process faults are intractable, this paper derives approximate posterior
distributions via Variational Bayes inference. Numerical and simulation case
studies using an actual autobody assembly process are performed to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method.

military to take advantage of data and devices distributed at multiple vantage
points to adapt and learn. The existing distributed machine learning
frameworks, however, cannot realize the full benefits of DML, because they are
all based on the simple linear aggregation framework, but linear aggregation
cannot handle the $\textit{divergence challenges}$ arising in military
settings: the learning data at different devices can be heterogeneous
($\textit{i.e.}$, Non-IID data), leading to model divergence, but the ability
for devices to communicate is substantially limited ($\textit{i.e.}$, weak
connectivity due to sparse and dynamic communications), reducing the ability
for devices to reconcile model divergence. In this paper, we introduce a novel
DML framework called aggregation in the mirror space (AIMS) that allows a DML
system to introduce a general mirror function to map a model into a mirror
space to conduct aggregation and gradient descent. Adapting the convexity of
the mirror function according to the divergence force, AIMS allows automatic
optimization of DML. We conduct both rigorous analysis and extensive
experimental evaluations to demonstrate the benefits of AIMS. For example, we
prove that AIMS achieves a loss of
$O\left((\frac{m^{r+1}}{T})^{\frac1r}\right)$ after $T$ network-wide updates,
where $m$ is the number of devices and $r$ the convexity of the mirror
function, with existing linear aggregation frameworks being a special case with
$r=2$. Our experimental evaluations using EMANE (Extendable Mobile Ad-hoc
Network Emulator) for military communications settings show similar results:
AIMS can improve DML convergence rate by up to 57\% and scale well to more
devices with weak connectivity, all with little additional computation overhead

under which the DWR matches RCOP for any m two-sided linear matrix

identical to the closed convex hull of RCOP feasible set; and (iii) objective

conditions unify, refine, and extend the existing exactness results in the
quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) and fair unsupervised

describe solvent effects, ranging from quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics

non-polarizable and polarizable QM/MM methods, the latter based on the
fluctuating charge (FQ) force field. In addition, we use a quantum embedding
method defined in the context of multilevel Hartree-Fock (MLHF), where the
system is divided into active and inactive regions, and combine it with a third
layer described by means of the FQ model. The multiscale approaches are then
used as reference wave functions for equation-of-motion coupled cluster
(EOM-CC) response properties, allowing for the account of electron correlation.
The developed models are applied to the calculation of linear response
properties of two organic moieties -- namely, para-nitroaniline and
benzonitrile -- in non-aqueous solvents -- 1,4-dioxane, acetonitrile, and
tetrahydrofuran. The computed polarizabilities are then discussed in terms of
the physico-chemical solute-solvent interactions described by each method

Mie scattering for the multi-scattering of photons in the absorber. The
absorber consists of epoxy, carbon black, and expanded polystyrene beads. The
typical size of the expanded polystyrene beads is consistent with the peak of
cross-section of Mie scattering to increase the mean free path in the absorber.
By applying this effect, we succeeded in improving the performance of the
absorber. In this paper, we measured the optical property of epoxy for the
calculation of the Mie scattering effect. Based on the calculation result, we
developed the 8 types samples by changing the ratio of absorber material. To
compare 8 samples, we characterized the reflectance and transmittance of the
absorber in millimeter length. The measured reflectance and transmittance of 2

measured the transmittance in sub-millimeter wavelength. The measured

not intensifying/concentrating as MDs. Warming over the Northern Parts of the
Arabian Sea (NPAS) boosted convection in August 2020, resulting in substantial
low-level convergence. Strong northwesterly winds from central Asia also
combined with the cross-equatorial monsoon flow. This powerful flow across the
Arabian Sea split into two branches: one extending to NW India following the
monsoon trough, and another diverging into an anticyclone over the south Bay of
Bengal (SBOB), reducing horizontal shear there (Barotropic Instability). Due to
weak barotropic instability over the head BOB, LPAs cannot become MDs. In
August 2020, the 200 hPa barotropic Rossby wave remains stationary over South
Central Asia and retrogresses northeast to southwest. It affected all-India
rainfall by increasing rainfall in the NW and Western Ghats (WG). Despite
unfavourable dynamical conditions, the barotropic Rossby wave and low-level
anticyclone over the WNP caused above-normal rainfall over India in August

model validation checks to the canonical Smets and Wouters 2007 DSGE: (1) we
simulate the model and see how well it can be estimated from its own simulation
output, and (2) we see how well it can seem to fit nonsense data. We find that
(1) even with centuries' worth of data, the model remains poorly estimated, and
(2) when we swap series at random, so that (e.g.) what the model gets as the
inflation rate is really hours worked, what it gets as hours worked is really
investment, etc., the fit is often only slightly impaired, and in a large
percentage of cases actually improves (even out of sample). Taken together,
these findings cast serious doubt on the meaningfulness of parameter estimates
for this DSGE, and on whether this specification represents anything structural
about the economy. Constructively, our approaches can be used for model
validation by anyone working with macroeconomic time series.

Yet calibration is not enough: even a perfectly calibrated classifier with the
best possible accuracy can have confidence scores that are far from the true
posterior probabilities. This is due to the grouping loss, created by samples
with the same confidence scores but different true posterior probabilities.
Proper scoring rule theory shows that given the calibration loss, the missing
piece to characterize individual errors is the grouping loss. While there are
many estimators of the calibration loss, none exists for the grouping loss in

technique to overcome these limitations and provide accurate and precise shape

telescope apertures is calculated numerically. Far-field wavefront error is
estimated with the absolute height of the peak-to-valley phase deviation
between distorted Gaussian beam and a reference distortion-free Gaussian beam.
The results show the pointing jitter is strongly related to the wavefront
error. Furthermore, when jitter decreases 10 times from 100 to 10 nrad,
wavefront error reduces for more than an order of magnitude. In the analysis of
multi-parameter minimization, the minimum of wavefront error tends to Z[5,3]
Zernike in some parameter ranges. Some Zernikes have a strong correlation with
wavefront error of the received beam. When the aperture diameter increases at
Z[5,3] Zernike, wavefront error is not monotonic and has oscillation.
Nevertheless, wavefront error almost remains constant with the arm length
increasing from 10$^{-1}$ Mkm to 10$^3$ Mkm. When the arm length decreases for

imaging data. The process is based on Shape-Orientation-Size (SOS) conservation
for the principal triangle in an image generated from the three fringes made
from a triad of receiving elements, in situations where interferometric phase
errors can be factorized into element-based terms. The basis of the SOS
conservation principle is that, for a 3-element array, the only possible image
corruption due to an element-based phase screen is a tilt of the aperture
plane, leading to a shift in the image plane. Thus, an image made from any
3-element interferometer represents a true image of the source brightness,
modulo an unknown translation. Image plane self-calibration entails deriving
the unknown translations for each triad image via cross-correlation of the
observed triad image with a model image of the source brightness. After
correcting for these independent shifts, and summing the aligned triad images,
a good image of the source brightness is generated from the full array,
recovering source structure at diffraction-limited resolution. The process is
iterative, using improved source models based on previous iterations. We
demonstrate the technique in the high signal-to-noise context, and include a
configuration based on radio astronomical facilities, and simple models of
double sources. We show that the process converges for the simple models
considered, although convergence is slower than for aperture-plane
self-calibration for large-$N$ arrays. As currently implemented, the process is
most relevant for arrays with a small number of elements. More generally, the
technique provides geometric insight into closure phase and the
self-calibration process. The technique is generalizable to non-astronomical

methods mostly rely on solving a generative model that learns a mapping from
the latent space to the original input space, which is an unstable ill-posed
inverse problem. To relieve the underdetermined system, we propose a model
solving a direct problem, dubbed learning with Missing Modalities in Multimodal
healthcare data (M3Care). M3Care is an end-to-end model compensating the
missing information of the patients with missing modalities to perform clinical
analysis. Instead of generating raw missing data, M3Care imputes the
task-related information of the missing modalities in the latent space by the
auxiliary information from each patient's similar neighbors, measured by a
task-guided modality-adaptive similarity metric, and thence conducts the
clinical tasks. The task-guided modality-adaptive similarity metric utilizes
the uncensored modalities of the patient and the other patients who also have
the same uncensored modalities to find similar patients. Experiments on
real-world datasets show that M3Care outperforms the state-of-the-art
baselines. Moreover, the findings discovered by M3Care are consistent with
experts and medical knowledge, demonstrating the capability and the potential
of providing useful insights and explanations.

Bayesian quadrature offers sample-efficient integration via model-based
inference that minimises the number of battery model evaluations. The posterior
distribution of model parameters can also be inferred as a byproduct without
further computation. Here, the simplest lithium-ion battery models, equivalent
circuit models, were used to analyse the sensitivity of the selection criterion

multimodal posterior. The model evidence can spot the optimal model in such
cases, simultaneously providing the variance of the evidence inference itself

observed by \textit{Herschel} with 1.2<z<4.0. The foreground samples are QSOs
and massive galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts between 0.2 and 1.0. The
cross-correlation measurements are estimated with the Davis-Peebles estimator
by stacking the SMG-QSO and SMG-galaxy pairs for the two analysed cases,
respectively. This approach allows us to study the mass density profile from

two of the most common theoretical mass density profiles in order to fit the
cross-correlation measurements. The measurements are correctly fitted after
splitting the available angular scales into an inner and an outer part using
independent mass density profiles for each region. For the QSOs, we obtain
masses and concentrations of $\log_{10}(M/M_{\odot})=13.51\pm0.04;
C=6.85\pm0.34$ for the inner part and $\log_{10}(M/M_{\odot})=13.44\pm0.17;

density profile and much higher concentration with respect to the outer part.
We obtain similar values for the central mass with both samples, in agreement
with those of galaxy clusters results. However, the estimated masses for the
outer region and the concentrations of the inner region both vary with lens

underconstrained. Prior knowledge about what objects are plausible can help,
but even given such prior knowledge there may still be uncertainty about the
shapes of occluded parts of objects. Recently, conditional neural radiance
field (NeRF) models have been developed that can learn to infer good point
estimates of 3D models from single 2D images. The problem of inferring
uncertainty estimates for these models has received less attention. In this
work, we propose probabilistic NeRF (ProbNeRF), a model and inference strategy
for learning probabilistic generative models of 3D objects' shapes and
appearances, and for doing posterior inference to recover those properties from
2D images. ProbNeRF is trained as a variational autoencoder, but at test time
we use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) for inference. Given one or a few 2D
images of an object (which may be partially occluded), ProbNeRF is able not
only to accurately model the parts it sees, but also to propose realistic and
diverse hypotheses about the parts it does not see. We show that key to the
success of ProbNeRF are (i) a deterministic rendering scheme, (ii) an
annealed-HMC strategy, (iii) a hypernetwork-based decoder architecture, and
(iv) doing inference over a full set of NeRF weights, rather than just a
low-dimensional code.

the input representation impact but also the complex- against the real-valued

very high performance. We, therefore, use a different data pre-processing

these data can be paired, unpaired or hybrid paired-unpaired which makes the

valuable computing power to calculate the similarities of users, and enact the
calculation results into the packing rule. However, the expensive calculation
required in PoUS challenges miners in participating, and may induce plagiarism
and lying risks. To resolve these issues, PoUS embraces the best-effort schema
by allowing miners to compute partially. Besides, a voting mechanism based on
the two-parties computation and Bayesian truth serum is proposed to guarantee
privacy-preserved voting and truthful reports. Noticeably, PoUS distinguishes
itself in recycling the computing power back to blockchain since it turns the
resource wastage to facilitate refined cohort analysis of users, serving as the
spatial measurer and enabling a searchable blockchain. We build a prototype of
PoUS and compare its performance with PoW. The results show that PoUS
outperforms PoW in achieving an average TPS improvement of 24.01% and an

electronic structure field and nearly formidable for non-expert researchers.
Lightshow solves this problem by providing a uniform abstraction for writing
computational x-ray spectroscopy input files for multiple popular codes,
including FEFF, VASP, OCEAN, EXCITING and XSPECTRA. Its extendable framework
will also allow the community to easily add new functions and to incorporate
new simulation codes.

brain are the defining 'A' and 'T' hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and
together with structural atrophy detectable on brain magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) scans as one of the neurodegenerative ('N') biomarkers comprise the ''ATN
framework'' of AD. Current methods to detect A$\beta$/tau pathology include
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; invasive), positron emission tomography (PET; costly
and not widely available), and blood-based biomarkers (BBBM; promising but
mainly still in development).
  Objective: To develop a non-invasive and widely available structural
MRI-based framework to quantitatively predict the amyloid and tau measurements.
  Methods: With MRI-based hippocampal multivariate morphometry statistics (MMS)
features, we apply our Patch Analysis-based Surface Correntropy-induced Sparse
coding and max-pooling (PASCS-MP) method combined with the ridge regression
model to individual amyloid/tau measure prediction.
  Results: We evaluate our framework on amyloid PET/MRI and tau PET/MRI
datasets from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Each
subject has one pair consisting of a PET image and MRI scan, collected at about
the same time. Experimental results suggest that amyloid/tau measurements
predicted with our PASCP-MP representations are closer to the real values than
the measures derived from other approaches, such as hippocampal surface area,
volume, and shape morphometry features based on spherical harmonics (SPHARM).
  Conclusion: The MMS-based PASCP-MP is an efficient tool that can bridge
hippocampal atrophy with amyloid and tau pathology and thus help assess disease
burden, progression, and treatment effects.

synchrony among neuronal populations, giving rise to richly patterned
functional connections. A fundamental problem for systems neuroscience is
determining the best way to relate structural and functional networks
quantified by diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional MRI. As one
of the state-of-the-art approaches for network analysis, graph convolutional
networks (GCN) have been separately used to analyze functional and structural
networks, but have not been applied to explore inter-network relationships. In
this work, we propose to couple the two networks of an individual by adding
inter-network edges between corresponding brain regions, so that the joint
structure-function graph can be directly analyzed by a single GCN. The weights
of inter-network edges are learnable, reflecting non-uniform structure-function
coupling strength across the brain. We apply our Joint-GCN to predict age and
sex of 662 participants from the public dataset of the National Consortium on
Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) based on their functional
and micro-structural white-matter networks. Our results support that the
proposed Joint-GCN outperforms existing multi-modal graph learning approaches
for analyzing structural and functional networks.

nearby neurons are responsive to the same properties of input signals. Thus, in

topographic inductive bias in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To achieve
this, we introduced a new topographic loss and an efficient implementation to
topographically organize each convolutional layer of any CNN. We benchmarked
our new method on 4 datasets and 3 models in vision and audio tasks and showed
equivalent performance to all benchmarks. Besides, we also showcased the
generalizability of our topographic loss with how it can be used with different

provides a new avenue to obtain models that are more memory efficient while

putative alien civilizations have a very low probability until a civilization
reaches a certain age (called the Contact Era) after the onset of radio
communications. If biotic planets are common, putative advanced civilizations
may preferentially send probes to planets with technosignatures, such as radio
broadcastings. The contact probability is defined as the chance to find a
nearby civilization located close enough so that it could have detected the
earliest radio emissions (the radiosphere) and sent a probe that would reach
the Solar System at present. It is found that the current contact probability
for Earth is very low unless civilizations are extremely abundant. Since the
radiosphere expands with time, so does the contact probability. The Contact Era
is defined as the time (since the onset of radio transmissions) at which the
contact probability becomes of order unity. At that time alien probes (or
messages) become more likely. Unless civilizations are highly abundant, the
Contact Era is shown to be of the order of a few hundred to a few thousand
years and may be applied not only to physical probes but also to transmissions
(i.e. SETI). Consequently, it is shown that civilizations are unlikely to be
able to inter-communicate unless their communicative lifetime is at least a few
thousand years.

Quality of Service (QoS) in many scenarios by deploying services on cloud and

decompose complex business logic into many small independent services.
Meanwhile, as microservice systems continue to grow, providing stable QoS in
these systems becomes a challenge, and many different approaches have been
proposed for stable QoS. However, the microservice systems used in the
experiments of these work have problems such as the low number of services and
a single type of service. Therefore, we developed the open-source benchmark
microservice system RescureService with 20+ services, including database,
front-end, business logic, data processing, and artificial intelligence
services in the disaster relief scenario. Measuring tools are provided to
measure the service properties to help researchers prepare experimental data,
and the service properties pre-measured are also presented. Meanwhile, the
fulfillment of benchmark requirements is detailed, and the results show that
our RescureService meets the requirements of a benchmark system in research.
Moreover, instructions are given to describe adopting our system in service
