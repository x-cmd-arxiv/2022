today's best models are brittle when presented with variations that differ even
slightly from those seen during training. Minor shifts in the pose, color, or
illumination of an object can lead to catastrophic misclassifications.
State-of-the art models struggle to understand how a set of variations can
affect different objects. We propose a framework for instilling a notion of how
objects vary in more realistic settings. Our approach applies the formalism of
Lie groups to capture continuous transformations to improve models' robustness
to distributional shifts. We apply our framework on top of state-of-the-art
self-supervised learning (SSL) models, finding that explicitly modeling
transformations with Lie groups leads to substantial performance gains of
greater than 10% for MAE on both known instances seen in typical poses now
presented in new poses, and on unknown instances in any pose. We also apply our
approach to ImageNet, finding that the Lie operator improves performance by
almost 4%. These results demonstrate the promise of learning transformations to
improve model robustness.

These spin state distributions will be valuable for planning Apophis
observation campaigns and spacecraft missions, most notably OSIRIS-APEX. The
simulations indicate that gravitationally induced changes to the asteroid's
tumbling periods and rotational angular momentum direction (pole) will likely
be significant and measurable. For the current spin state and inertia estimates
and their uncertainties, Apophis is likely to remain in a short axis mode (SAM)
tumbling state but its effective spin rate could halve or double. Its pole is
likely to shift by 10 degrees or more and increase in longitude while moving
closer to the ecliptic plane. These spin state changes are very sensitive to
the asteroid's close approach attitude and mass distribution. With ground-based
tracking of the asteroid's spin state through the encounter, this sensitivity
will help refine mass distribution knowledge. We also discuss the implications
of this abrupt spin state alteration for Apophis' Yarkovsky acceleration and
geophysical properties, identifying possible pathways for surface and internal
changes, most notably if Apophis is a contact binary. Comparison of the pre and
post-flyby inertia estimates obtained from the ground-based observations will

exhibit internal metallicity variations amongst the so-called first-population
stars, until now considered to have a homogeneous initial chemical composition.
This is not fully supported by the sparse spectroscopic evidence, which so far
gives conflicting results. Here, we present a high-resolution re-analysis of
five stars in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 2808 taken from the literature.
Target stars are bright red giants with nearly identical atmospheric parameters
belonging to the first population according to their identification in the
chromosome map of the cluster, and we have measured precise differential
abundances for Fe, Si, Ca, Ti, and Ni to the ~0.03 dex level.
  Thanks to the very small uncertainties associated to the differential
atmospheric parameters and abundance measurements, we find that target stars
span a range of iron abundance equal to 0.25 +/- 0.06 dex. The individual
elemental abundances are highly correlated with the position of the star along
the extended sequence described by first population objects in the cluster
chromosome map: bluer stars have a lower iron content. This agrees with
inferences from the photometric analysis.
  The differential abundances for all other elements also show statistically
significant ranges that point to intrinsic abundance spreads. The Si, Ca, Ti,
and Ni variations are highly correlated with iron variations and the total
abundance spreads for all elements are consistent within the error bars. This
suggests a scenario in which short-lived massive stars exploding as supernovae
contributed to the self-enrichment of the gas in the natal cloud while star
formation was still ongoing.

affect star formation (either positively or negatively), eject gas from the
core or disk, and directly cause mixing of pristine and processed material.
Active outflows may be detected through searches for broad spectral line
emission or high-velocity gas, but it is also possible to determine the
presence of past outflows by searching for extended reservoirs of chemically
enriched molecular gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around galaxies. In
this work, we examine the CO(3-2) emission of a set of seven z~2.0-2.5 AGN host
galaxies, as observed with ALMA. Through a three-dimensional stacking analysis
we find evidence for extended CO emission of radius r~13kpc. We extend this
analysis to the HST/ACS i-band images of the sample galaxies, finding a complex
small-scale (r<10kpc) morphology but no robust evidence for extended emission.
In addition, the dust emission (traced by rest-frame FIR emission) shows no
evidence for significant spatial extension. This indicates that the diffuse CO
emission revealed by ALMA is morphologically distinct from the stellar
component, and thus traces an extended reservoir of enriched gas. The presence
of a diffuse, enriched molecular reservoir around this sample of AGN host
galaxies at cosmic noon hints at a history of AGN-driven outflows that likely
had strong effects on the star formation history of these objects.

walking on a horizontally oscillating DRS. The highest layer of our approach is
a real-time motion planner that generates desired global behaviors (i.e., the
center of mass trajectories and footstep locations) by stabilizing a
reduced-order robot model. One key novelty of this layer is the derivation of
the reduced-order model by analytically extending the angular momentum based
linear inverted pendulum (ALIP) model from stationary to horizontally moving

pattern generator that translates the desired global behaviors into the robot's
full-body reference trajectories for all directly actuated degrees of freedom.
The lowest layer is an input-output linearizing controller that exponentially
tracks those full-body reference trajectories based on the full-order, hybrid,
nonlinear robot dynamics. Simulations of planar underactuated bipedal walking
on a swaying DRS confirm that the proposed framework ensures the walking
stability under different DRS motions and gait types.

and is held captive by the attacker until a ransom demand is met. A common
approach used by many crypto-ransomware detection techniques is to monitor file
system activity and attempt to identify encrypted files being written to disk,
often using a file's entropy as an indicator of encryption. However, often in
the description of these techniques, little or no discussion is made as to why
a particular entropy calculation technique is selected or any justification
given as to why one technique is selected over the alternatives. The Shannon
method of entropy calculation is the most commonly-used technique when it comes
to file encryption identification in crypto-ransomware detection techniques.
Overall, correctly encrypted data should be indistinguishable from random data,
so apart from the standard mathematical entropy calculations such as
Chi-Square, Shannon Entropy and Serial Correlation, the test suites used to
validate the output from pseudo-random number generators would also be suited
to perform this analysis. he hypothesis being that there is a fundamental
difference between different entropy methods and that the best methods may be

first phase is used to identify potential candidate tests, and a second phase
where these candidates are thoroughly evaluated. To ensure that the tests were
sufficiently robust, the NapierOne dataset is used. This dataset contains
thousands of examples of the most commonly used file types, as well as examples

  Data Using Reinforcement Learning",,"2023 Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting",,,"eess.SY cs.AI cs.LG cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traffic signal control has the potential to reduce congestion in dynamic
networks. Recent studies show that traffic signal control with reinforcement
learning (RL) methods can significantly reduce the average waiting time.
However, a shortcoming of existing methods is that they require model
retraining for new intersections with different structures. In this paper, we
propose a novel reinforcement learning approach with augmented data (ADLight)
to train a universal model for intersections with different structures. We
propose a new agent design incorporating features on movements and actions with
set current phase duration to allow the generalized model to have the same
structure for different intersections. A new data augmentation method named
\textit{movement shuffle} is developed to improve the generalization
performance. We also test the universal model with new intersections in
Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). The results show that the performance of
our approach is close to the models trained in a single environment directly
(only a 5% loss of average waiting time), and we can reduce more than 80% of
training time, which saves a lot of computational resources in scalable
operations of traffic lights.

continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW) in $n$ dimensions -- where $n$ is the
number of nodes -- are presented, tested and discussed. The main idea behind
these methods consists in re-casting the classical HITS and PageRank algorithms
as eigenvector problems for symmetric matrices, and using these symmetric
matrices as Hamiltonians for CTQWs, in order to obtain a unitary evolution
operator. The choice of the initial state is also crucial. Two options were
tested: a vector with uniform occupation and a vector weighted w.r.t.~in- or
out-degrees (for authority and hub centrality, respectively). Two methods are
based on a HITS-derived Hamiltonian, and two use a PageRank-derived
Hamiltonian. Centrality scores for the nodes are defined as the average
occupation values. All the methods have been tested on a set of small, simple
graphs in order to spot possible evident drawbacks, and then on a larger number
of artificially generated larger-sized graphs, in order to draw a comparison
with classical HITS and PageRank. Numerical results show that, despite some
pathologies found in three of the methods when analyzing small graphs, all the
methods are effective in finding the first and top ten nodes in larger graphs.
We comment on the results and offer some insight into the good accordance
between classical and quantum approaches.

the observed spin state evolution of some GEO objects via the
Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect. These studies have focused
primarily on uniform rotation. Nevertheless, many objects are in non-principal
axis rotation (i.e. tumbling). Recent exploration of the tumbling regime for
the family of retired GOES 8-12 satellites has shown intriguing YORP-driven
behavior including spin-orbit coupling, tumbling cycles, and tumbling period
resonances. To better explore and understand the tumbling regime, we develop a
semi-analytical tumbling-averaged rotational dynamics model. The derivation
requires analytically averaging over the satellite's torque-free rotation,
defined by Jacobi elliptic functions. Averaging is facilitated by a second
order Fourier series approximation of the facet illumination function. The
averaged model is found to capture and explain the general long-term behavior
of the full dynamics while reducing computation time by roughly three orders of
magnitude. This improved computation efficiency promises to enable rapid
exploration of general long-term rotational dynamics for defunct satellites and

Similarly, to effectively navigate through rooms agents need to remember the
floor plan of how rooms are connected. However, most benchmark tasks in
reinforcement learning do not test long-term memory in agents, slowing down
progress in this important research direction. In this paper, we introduce the
Memory Maze, a 3D domain of randomized mazes specifically designed for
evaluating long-term memory in agents. Unlike existing benchmarks, Memory Maze
measures long-term memory separate from confounding agent abilities and
requires the agent to localize itself by integrating information over time.
With Memory Maze, we propose an online reinforcement learning benchmark, a
diverse offline dataset, and an offline probing evaluation. Recording a human
player establishes a strong baseline and verifies the need to build up and
retain memories, which is reflected in their gradually increasing rewards
within each episode. We find that current algorithms benefit from training with
truncated backpropagation through time and succeed on small mazes, but fall
short of human performance on the large mazes, leaving room for future
algorithmic designs to be evaluated on the Memory Maze.

probabilistic models, which is often preferred over the traditional
maximum-likelihood (ML) approach. However, these models are less interpretable
than normalized models; as such, training robustness is in general difficult to
assess. We present a critical study of existing variational SM objectives,
showing catastrophic failure on a wide range of datasets and network
architectures. Our theoretical insights on the objectives emerge directly from
their equivalent autoencoding losses when optimizing variational autoencoder
(VAE) models. First, we show that in the Fisher autoencoder, SM produces far
worse models than maximum-likelihood, and approximate inference by Fisher
divergence can lead to low-density local optima. However, with important
modifications, this objective reduces to a regularized autoencoding loss that
resembles the evidence lower bound (ELBO). This analysis predicts that the
modified SM algorithm should behave very similarly to ELBO on Gaussian VAEs. We
then review two other FD-based objectives from the literature and show that
they reduce to uninterpretable autoencoding losses, likely leading to poor
performance. The experiments verify our theoretical predictions and suggest
that only ELBO and the baseline objective robustly produce expected results,
while previously proposed SM methods do not.

normalization constant is a fundamental problem in computational statistics and
machine learning. In this paper, we present a new optimization-based method for
sampling called mollified interaction energy descent (MIED). MIED minimizes a
new class of energies on probability measures called mollified interaction
energies (MIEs). These energies rely on mollifier functions -- smooth
approximations of the Dirac delta originated from PDE theory. We show that as
the mollifier approaches the Dirac delta, the MIE converges to the chi-square
divergence with respect to the target measure and the gradient flow of the MIE
agrees with that of the chi-square divergence. Optimizing this energy with
proper discretization yields a practical first-order particle-based algorithm
for sampling in both unconstrained and constrained domains. We show
experimentally that for unconstrained sampling problems our algorithm performs
on par with existing particle-based algorithms like SVGD, while for constrained
sampling problems our method readily incorporates constrained optimization
techniques to handle more flexible constraints with strong performance compared
to alternatives.

low-order nonlinear couplings among three bosonic modes or between a bosonic

readily implementable with current experimental platforms such as

enhanced noise bias. Furthermore, the bias-preserving operations for the SC
have much lower error rates. In combination, the stabilized SC leads to
substantially better logical performance when concatenating with an outer
discrete-variable code. The surface-SC scheme achieves more than one order of
magnitude increase in the threshold ratio between the loss rate $\kappa_1$ and
the engineered dissipation rate $\kappa_2$. Under a practical noise ratio

  approaches with clustered time to event data","22 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables",,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Informative cluster size (ICS) arises in situations with clustered data where
a latent relationship exists between the number of participants in a cluster
and the outcome measures. Although this phenomenon has been sporadically
reported in statistical literature for nearly two decades now, further
exploration is needed in certain statistical methodologies to avoid potentially
misleading inferences. For inference about population quantities without
covariates, inverse cluster size reweightings are often employed to adjust for
ICS. Further, to study the effect of covariates on disease progression
described by a multistate model, the pseudo-value regression technique has
gained popularity in time-to-event data analysis. We seek to answer the
question: ""How to apply pseudo-value regression to clustered time-to-event data

be performed in two steps; estimation of marginal functions of the multistate
model and fitting the estimating equations based on pseudo-value responses,
leading to four possible strategies. We present theoretical arguments and
thorough simulation experiments to ascertain the correct strategy for adjusting
for ICS. A further extension of our methodology is implemented to include
informativeness induced by the intra-cluster group size. We demonstrate the
methods in two real-world applications: (i) to determine predictors of tooth
survival in a periodontal study, and (ii) to identify indicators of ambulatory

have shown that the large dust aggregates observed at millimeter wavelengths
settle to the midplane into a remarkably thin layer. Aims: We intend to find
out if the geometric thinness of these layers is evidence against the vertical
shear instability (VSI) operating in these disks. Methods: We performed
hydrodynamic simulations of a protoplanetary disk with a locally isothermal
equation of state, and let the VSI fully develop. We sprinkled dust particles
and followed their motion as they got stirred up by the VSI. We determined for
which grain size the layer becomes geometrically thin enough to be consistent
with ALMA observations. We then verified if, with these grain sizes, it is
still possible to generate a moderately optically thick layer at millimeter
wavelengths, as observations appear to indicate. Results: We found that even
very large dust aggregates with Stokes numbers close to unity get stirred up to
relatively large heights above the midplane by the VSI, which is in conflict
with the observed geometric thinness. For grains so large that the Stokes
number exceeds unity, the layer can be made to remain thin, but we show that it
is hard to make dust layers optically thick at ALMA wavelengths (e.g.,
tau(1.3mm)>=1) with such large dust aggregates. Conclusions: We conclude that
protoplanetary disks with geometrically thin midplane dust layers cannot be VSI
unstable, at least not down to the disk midplane. Explanations for the
inhibition of the VSI include a reduced dust-to-gas ratio of the small dust
grains that are responsible for the radiative cooling of the disk. A reduction
of small grains by a factor of between 10 and 100 is sufficient to quench the
VSI. Such a reduction is plausible in dust growth models, and still consistent
with observations at optical and infrared wavelengths.

the possible violation of QCD factorization for the Compton scattering
amplitude. Remarkably, we also find poles in the unpolarized case which are
remnants of the trace anomaly. We argue that these poles are cancelled by the
would-be massless glueball poles in the GPDs $H$ and $E$ as well as in their
moments, the nucleon gravitational form factors $A,B$ and $D$. This mechanism
sheds light on the connection between the gravitational form factors and the
gluon condensate operator $F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}$.

linked to an increase in offline violence and negative psychological effects on

behavior. We collected a sample of 79.8k Twitter conversations. Then, through a
longitudinal study, for nine weeks, we tracked and compared the behavioral
reactions of authors, who were toxicity victims, with those who were not. We
found that toxicity victims show a combination of the following behavioral
reactions: avoidance, revenge, countermeasures, and negotiation. We performed
statistical tests to understand the significance of the contribution of toxic
replies toward user behaviors while considering confounding factors, such as
the structure of conversations and the user accounts' visibility,
identifiability, and activity level. Interestingly, we found that compared to
other random authors, victims are more likely to engage in conversations, reply
in a toxic way, and unfollow toxicity instigators. Even if the toxicity is
directed at other participants, the root authors are more likely to engage in
the conversations and reply in a toxic way. However, victims who have verified
accounts are less likely to participate in conversations or respond by posting
toxic comments. In addition, replies are more likely to be removed in
conversations with a larger percentage of toxic nested replies and toxic
replies directed at other users. Our results can assist further studies in
developing more effective detection and intervention methods for reducing the
negative consequences of toxicity on social media.

for performing contact-rich tasks, such as machining, assembly, and human-robot

hardware level. Thus, adding compliance becomes essential. Compliance in those
systems has been recently achieved using Forward dynamics compliance control
(FDCC), which, owing to its virtual forward dynamics model, can be implemented
on both position and velocity-controlled robots. This paper evaluates the
choice of control interface (and hence the control domain), which, although
considered trivial, is essential due to differences in their characteristics.
In some cases, the choice is restricted to the available hardware interface.
However, given the option to choose, the velocity-based control interface makes
a better candidate for compliance control because of smoother compliant
behaviour, reduced interaction forces, and work done. To prove these points, in
this paper FDCC is evaluated on the UR10e six-DOF manipulator with velocity and
position control modes. The evaluation is based on force-control benchmarking
metrics using 3D-printed artefacts. Real experiments favour the choice of
velocity control over position control.

electroelasticity theory and linearized incremental theory to derive the
governing equations. First we determine the nonlinear static response of the
soft dielectric PC plate subjected to a combination of axial force and electric
voltage. Then we study the motion of superimposed incremental bending waves. By
adopting the Spectral Element Method, we obtain the dispersion relation for the
infinite PC plate and the transmission coefficient for the finite PC plate

state exists at the interface of the finite phononic plate waveguide with two
topologically different elements. By simply adjusting the axial force or the
electric voltage, an increase or decrease in the frequency of the topological
interface state can be realized. Furthermore, applying the electric voltage
separately on different elements of the PC plate waveguide is a flexible and
smart method to tune the topological interface state in a wide range. These
results provide guidance for designing soft smart wave devices with
low-frequency tunable topological interface states.

data augmentation to enrich the training data. In particular, we design three
novel pseudo-label based data augmentation policies (PseudoAugments) to fuse
both labeled and pseudo-labeled scenes, including frames (PseudoFrame), objecta

pseudo labeling by mitigating pseudo labeling errors and generating diverse

and iterative pseudo labeling, we develop a population-based data augmentation
framework for 3D detection, named AutoPseudoAugment. Unlike previous works that
perform pseudo-labeling offline, our framework performs PseudoAugments and
hyperparameter tuning in one shot to reduce computational cost. Experimental
results on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset show our method outperforms
state-of-the-art auto data augmentation method (PPBA) and self-training method

efficient on vehicle and pedestrian tasks compared to prior arts. Notably,
AutoPseudoAugment nearly matches the full dataset training results, with just
10% of the labeled run segments on the vehicle detection task.

aspect in the analysis of cosmic shear data. This, one way or another, requires
the use of spectroscopic or high-quality photometric samples. However, the
difficulty to obtain colour-complete spectroscopic samples matching the depth
of weak lensing catalogs means that the analyses of different cosmic shear
datasets often use the same samples for redshift calibration. This introduces a
source of statistical and systematic uncertainty that is highly correlated
across different weak lensing datasets, and which must be accurately
characterised and propagated in order to obtain robust cosmological constraints
from their combination. In this paper we introduce a method to quantify and
propagate the uncertainties on the source redshift distribution in two
different surveys sharing the same calibrating sample. The method is based on
an approximate analytical marginalisation of the $p(z)$ statistical
uncertainties and the correlated marginalisation of residual systematics. We
apply this method to the combined analysis of cosmic shear data from the DESY1
data release and the HSC-DR1 data, using the COSMOS 30-band catalog as a common
redshift calibration sample. We find that, although there is significant
correlation in the uncertainties on the redshift distributions of both samples,
this does not change the final constraints on cosmological parameters
significantly. The same is true also for the impact of residual systematic
uncertainties from the errors in the COSMOS 30-band photometric redshifts.
Additionally, we show that these effects will still be negligible in Stage-IV
datasets. Finally, the combination of DESY1 and HSC-DR1 allows us to constrain
the ``clumpiness'' parameter to $S_8 = 0.768^{+0.021}_{-0.017}$. This
corresponds to a $\sim\sqrt{2}$ improvement in uncertainties with respect to
either DES or HSC alone.

offline reinforcement learning (RL), where the future outcome (i.e., return)

heart of popular algorithms such as decision transformer (DT), these methods
tend to perform poorly in highly stochastic environments, where an occasional
high return can arise from randomness in the environment rather than the
actions themselves. Such situations can lead to a learned policy that is
inconsistent with its conditioning inputs; i.e., using the policy to act in the
environment, when conditioning on a specific desired return, leads to a
distribution of real returns that is wildly different than desired. In this
work, we propose the dichotomy of control (DoC), a future-conditioned
supervised learning framework that separates mechanisms within a policy's
control (actions) from those beyond a policy's control (environment
stochasticity). We achieve this separation by conditioning the policy on a
latent variable representation of the future, and designing a mutual
information constraint that removes any information from the latent variable

yields policies that are consistent with their conditioning inputs, ensuring

or mental shortcuts, to make quick decisions while expending less effort. While
performing annotation work on crowdsourcing platforms, we hypothesize that such
heuristic use among annotators cascades on to data quality and model
robustness. In this work, we study cognitive heuristic use in the context of
annotating multiple-choice reading comprehension datasets. We propose tracking
annotator heuristic traces, where we tangibly measure low-effort annotation
strategies that could indicate usage of various cognitive heuristics. We find
evidence that annotators might be using multiple such heuristics, based on
correlations with a battery of psychological tests. Importantly, heuristic use
among annotators determines data quality along several dimensions: (1) known
biased models, such as partial input models, more easily solve examples
authored by annotators that rate highly on heuristic use, (2) models trained on
annotators scoring highly on heuristic use don't generalize as well, and (3)
heuristic-seeking annotators tend to create qualitatively less challenging
examples. Our findings suggest that tracking heuristic usage among annotators
can potentially help with collecting challenging datasets and diagnosing model
biases.

method to remedy this issue. UAL aims at providing reliability-aware
predictions by considering data uncertainty and model uncertainty
simultaneously. Data uncertainty captures the ``noise"" inherent in the sample,
while model uncertainty depicts the model's confidence in the sample's
prediction. Specifically, in UAL, (1) we propose a sampling-free data
uncertainty learning method to adaptively assign weights to different samples
during training, down-weighting the low-quality ambiguous samples. (2) we
leverage the Bayesian framework to model the model uncertainty by assuming the
parameters of the network follow a Bernoulli distribution. (3) the data
uncertainty and the model uncertainty are jointly learned in a unified network,
and they serve as two fundamental criteria for the reliability assessment: if a
probe is high-quality (low data uncertainty) and the model is confident in the
prediction of the probe (low model uncertainty), the final ranking will be
assessed as reliable. Experiments under the risk-controlled settings and the
multi-query settings show the proposed reliability assessment is effective. Our
method also shows superior performance on three challenging benchmarks under
the vanilla single query settings.

generating samples from these states as hidden - or known - probability

are inherently hard to sample classically, QGM represents an excellent testbed
for quantum supremacy experiments. Furthermore, generative tasks are
increasingly relevant for industrial machine learning applications, and thus
QGM is a strong candidate for demonstrating a practical quantum advantage.
However, this requires that quantum circuits are trained to represent
industrially relevant distributions, and the corresponding training stage has
an extensive training cost for current quantum hardware in practice. In this
work, we propose protocols for classical training of QGMs based on circuits of
the specific type that admit an efficient gradient computation, while remaining
hard to sample. In particular, we consider Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial
(IQP) circuits and their extensions. Showing their classical simulability in
terms of the time complexity, sparsity and anti-concentration properties, we
develop a classically tractable way of simulating their output probability
distributions, allowing classical training to a target probability
distribution. The corresponding quantum sampling from IQPs can be performed
efficiently, unlike when using classical sampling. We numerically demonstrate
the end-to-end training of IQP circuits using probability distributions for up
to 30 qubits on a regular desktop computer. When applied to industrially
relevant distributions this combination of classical training with quantum
sampling represents an avenue for reaching advantage in the NISQ era.

phases can be coarsely classified by (i) whether or not the system irreversibly
exchanges energy of order $\omega$ with the drive, i.e., Floquet thermalizes,
and (ii) the ensemble describing the final equilibrium in systems that do
Floquet thermalize. These phases represent regimes of behavior in mesoscopic
systems, but they are sharply defined in a large-system limit where the drive
frequency $\omega$ scales up with system size $N$ as the $N\to\infty$ limit is
taken: we examine frequency scalings ranging from a weak $\omega \sim \log N$,
to stronger scalings ranging from $\omega \sim \sqrt{N}$ to $\omega \sim N$. We
show that the transition where Floquet thermalization breaks down occurs at
$\omega\sim N$ and, beyond that, systems that do not Floquet thermalize are
distinguished based on the presence or absence of rare resonances across
Floquet zones. We produce a thermalization phase diagram that is relevant for
numerical studies of Floquet systems and experimental studies on small-scale
quantum simulators, both of which lack a separation of scales between $N$ and
$\omega$. A striking prediction of our work is that, under perfect isolation,
certain realistic quench protocols from simple pure initial states can show
Floquet thermalization to a novel type of Schrodinger-cat state that is a

In the GQRL-IESE, a cooperative graded Q scheme is proposed to facilitate the

mapped out for four nearby 600-2000 Myr old open clusters to dcl>50 pc. These
are on near-circular Galactocentric orbits, a formula for estimating the
orbital eccentricity of an open cluster being derived. Applying the Phantom of
Ramses code to this problem, in Newtonian gravitation the tails are
near-symmetrical. In Milgromian dynamics (MOND) the asymmetry reaches the
observed values for 50 < dcl/pc < 200, being maximal near peri-galacticon, and
can slightly invert near apo-galacticon, and the K\""upper epicyclic
overdensities are asymmetrically spaced. Clusters on circular orbits develop
orbital eccentricity due to the asymmetrical spill-out, therewith spinning up
opposite to their orbital angular momentum. This positive dynamical feedback
suggests Milgromian open clusters to demise rapidly as their orbital
eccentricity keeps increasing. Future work is necessary to better delineate the
tidal tails around open clusters of different ages and to develop a Milgromian
direct n-body code.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently proven to be the natural choice for

CDM and SIDM, we find that the distributions of weak-lensing-inferred cluster
shapes are almost indistinguishable. We trace this information loss to two
causes. Firstly, weak lensing measures the shape of the projected mass
distribution, not the underlying 3D shape, and projection effects wash out some
of the difference. Secondly, weak lensing is most sensitive to the projected
shape of clusters, on a scale approaching the virial radius (~ 1.5 Mpc),
whereas SIDM shapes differ most from CDM in the inner halo. We introduce a
model for the mass distribution of galaxy clusters where the ellipticity of the
mass distribution can vary with distance to the centre of the cluster. While
this mass distribution does not enable weak lensing data to distinguish between
CDM and SIDM with cluster shapes (the ellipticity at small radii is poorly
constrained by weak lensing), it could be useful when modelling combined strong

the M-L plane also demonstrates that the evolutionary masses of the B

require a large amount of core overshooting (alpha_ov ~ 0.5), implying an
extended main-sequence width. We hence infer that the vast majority of B

common approach, reverberation mapping, quantifies the continuum and line lags
moving outwards through the disk at the light-travel time, revealing the size

expect longer lags to exist in AGN light curves that travel inward on longer

(complex) energy spectrum when the non-Hermiticity is below (above) a
threshold. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the non-Hermitian skin
effect generates a new type of PT symmetry, dubbed the non-Bloch PT symmetry,
featuring unique properties such as high sensitivity to the boundary condition.
Despite its relevance to a wide range of non-Hermitian lattice systems, a
general theory is still lacking for this generic phenomenon even in one spatial
dimension. Here, we uncover the geometric mechanism of non-Bloch PT symmetry
and its breaking. We find that non-Bloch PT symmetry breaking occurs by the
formation of cusps in the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). Based on this
geometric understanding, we propose an exact formula that efficiently
determines the breaking threshold. Finally, we predict a new type of spectral
singularities associated with the symmetry breaking, dubbed non-Bloch van Hove
singularities, whose physical mechanism fundamentally differs from their
Hermitian counterparts.

around black holes should generically have a ``photon ring,'' composed of a
series of increasingly sharp subrings that correspond to increasingly strongly
lensed emission near the black hole. Because the effects of lensing are
determined by the spacetime curvature, the photon ring provides a pathway to
precise measurements of the black hole properties and tests of the Kerr metric.
We explore the prospects for detecting and measuring the photon ring using very
long baseline interferometry (VLBI) with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and
the next generation EHT (ngEHT). We present a series of tests using idealized
self-fits to simple geometrical models and show that the EHT observations in
2017 and 2022 lack the angular resolution and sensitivity to detect the photon
ring, while the improved coverage and angular resolution of ngEHT at 230 GHz

using more realistic images from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
simulations by applying ``hybrid imaging,'' which simultaneously models two
components: a flexible raster image (to capture the direct emission) and a ring
component. Using the Bayesian VLBI modeling package \comrade, we show that the
results of hybrid imaging must be interpreted with extreme caution for both
photon ring detection and measurement -- hybrid imaging readily produces false
positives for a photon ring, and its ring measurements do not directly
correspond to the properties of the photon ring.

whether the imaging parameters used in EHT analyses are sensitive to ring
ellipticity and measure the constraints on the ellipticity of M 87*. We find
that the top set is unable to recover ellipticity. Even for simple geometric
models, the true ellipticity is biased low, preferring circular rings.
Therefore, to place a constraint on the ellipticity of M 87*, we measure the

channel on a shared bipartite state via non-local quantum computation -- a
protocol consisting of local operations and a single simultaneous round of
quantum communication. Such a protocol can occur in the AdS/CFT correspondence,
with the two parties represented by regions of the CFT, and the holographic
state serving as a resource to provide the necessary entanglement. This
boundary non-local computation is dual to the local implementation of a channel
in the bulk AdS theory. Previous work on this phenomenon was obstructed by the
divergent entanglement between adjacent CFT regions, and tried to circumvent
this issue by assuming that certain regions are irrelevant. However, the
absence of these regions introduces violent phenomena that prevent the CFT from
implementing the protocol. Instead, we resolve the issue of divergent
entanglement by using a finite-memory quantum simulation of the CFT. We show
that any finite-memory quantum system on a circular lattice yields a protocol
for non-local quantum computation. In the case of a quantum simulation of a
holographic CFT, we carefully show that this protocol implements the channel
performed by the local bulk dynamics. Under plausible physical assumptions
about quantum computation in the bulk, our results imply that non-local quantum

Library, which is a comprehensive collection of empirical, medium-resolution
stellar spectra. We constructed this parameter catalog by using a
multicomponent $\chi^{2}$ fitting approach to match MaStar spectra to models
generated by interpolating the ATLAS9-based BOSZ model spectra. The total
$\chi^{2}$ for a given model is defined as the sum of components constructed to
characterize narrow-band features of observed spectra (e.g., absorption lines)
and the broadband continuum shape separately. Extinction and systematics due to
flux calibration were taken into account in the fitting. The $\chi^{2}$
distribution for a given region of model space was sampled using a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, the data from which were then used to extract
atmospheric parameter estimates ($T_{eff}$, log g, [Fe/H], and [$\alpha$/Fe]),
their corresponding uncertainties, and direct extinction measurements. Two
methods were used to extract parameters and uncertainties: one that accepts the
MCMC's prescribed minimum-$\chi^{2}$ result, and one that uses Bayesian
inference to compute a likelihood-weighted mean from the $\chi^{2}$
distribution sampled by the MCMC. Results were evaluated for internal
consistency using repeat observations where available and by comparing them
with external data sets (e.g., APOGEE-2 and Gaia DR2). Our spectral-fitting
exercise reveals possible deficiencies in current theoretical model spectra,
illustrating the potential power of MaStar spectra for helping to improve the
models. This paper represents an update to the parameters that were originally
presented with SDSS-IV DR17. The MaStar parameter catalog containing our
BestFit results is available on the SDSS-IV DR17 website as part of version 2
of the MaStar stellar parameter value-added catalog.

try to explain some of this success from a feature learning perspective. We
focus our attention on classification problems in which each class may have
multiple associated features (or views) that can be used to predict the class

class of data distributions with two features per class, training a 2-layer
convolutional network using empirical risk minimization can lead to learning
only one feature for almost all classes while training with a specific

also show empirically that these theoretical insights extend to the practical

  Variability","19 pages, 15 Figures",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Partial dust obscuration in active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been proposed as
a potential explanation for some cases of AGN variability. The dust-gas mixture
present in AGN torii is accelerated by radiation pressure leading to the
launching of an AGN wind. Dust under these conditions has been shown to be
unstable to a generic class of fast growing resonant drag instabilities (RDIs).
We present the first set of numerical simulations of radiation driven outflows
that include explicit dust dynamics in conditions resembling AGN winds and
discuss the implications of the RDIs on the morphology of the AGN torus, AGN
variability, and the ability of the radiation to effectively launch a wind. We
find that the RDIs rapidly develop reaching saturation at times much shorter
than the global timescales of the outflows, resulting in the formation of
filamentary structure on box-size scales with strong dust clumping and
super-Alfv\'enic velocity dispersions on micro-scales. This results in 10-20%
fluctuations in dust opacity and gas column density, integrated along mock
observed lines-of-sight to the quasar accretion disk, over year to decade
timescales with a red-noise power spectrum which is commonly observed for AGN.
Additionally, all our simulations show that the radiation is sufficiently
coupled to the dust-gas mixture launching highly super-sonic winds, which
entrain 70-90% of gas, with a factor of $\lesssim 3$ photon momentum loss
relative to the ideal case. Therefore, the RDIs could play an important role in
generating the clumpy nature of AGN torii and driving AGN variability
consistent with observations.

In particular, molecular hydrogen measured by CO emission and dust measured by
far-infrared light are uniformly distributed along the ring. The ionized gas
revealed by H$\alpha$ and [CII] emission is distributed in knots along the
ring. Despite being classified as an SAa galaxy, M104 displays features typical
of early-type galaxies. We therefore compared its [CII] and dust emission to a
sample of early-type galaxies observed with Herschel and SOFIA. The [CII]/FIR
ratio of M104 is much lower than that of typical star-forming galaxies and is
instead much more similar to that of early-type galaxies. By classifying
regions using optical emission line diagnostics we also find that regions
classified as HII lie closer to star-forming galaxies in the [CII]/FIR diagram
than those classified as low-ionization emission regions. The good match
between [CII] and H$\alpha$ emission in conjunction with the lack of
correlation between CO emission and star formation suggest that there is very
limited active star formation along the ring and that most of the [CII]
emission is from ionized and neutral atomic gas rather than molecular gas. From

exhibit a time-reversal symmetry for all quantum channels. We do this by
introducing retrodiction families and functors, which capture many intuitive
properties that retrodiction should satisfy and are general enough to encompass
both classical and quantum theories alike. Classical Bayesian inversion and all
rotated and averaged Petz recovery maps define retrodiction families in our
sense. However, averaged rotated Petz recovery maps, including the universal
recovery map of Junge-Renner-Sutter-Wilde-Winter, do not define retrodiction
functors, since they fail to satisfy some compositionality properties. Among
all the examples we found of retrodiction families, the original Petz recovery
map is the only one that defines a retrodiction functor. In addition,
retrodiction functors exhibit an inferential time-reversal symmetry consistent
with the standard formulation of quantum theory. The existence of such a
retrodiction functor seems to be in stark contrast to the many no-go results on
time-reversal symmetry for quantum channels. One of the main reasons is because
such works defined time-reversal symmetry on the category of quantum channels
alone, whereas we define it on the category of quantum channels and quantum
states. This fact further illustrates the importance of a prior in
time-reversal symmetry.

emerged as a communication-efficient solution to accelerate distributed
learning. Top-K sparsification is one of the most popular gradient compression
methods that sparsifies the gradient in a fixed degree during model training.
However, there lacks an approach to adaptively adjust the degree of
sparsification to maximize the potential of model performance or training
speed. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a novel adaptive Top-K SGD
framework, enabling adaptive degree of sparsification for each gradient descent
step to maximize the convergence performance by exploring the trade-off between
communication cost and convergence error. Firstly, we derive an upper bound of
the convergence error for the adaptive sparsification scheme and the loss
function. Secondly, we design the algorithm by minimizing the convergence error
under the communication cost constraints. Finally, numerical results show that
the proposed adaptive Top-K in SGD achieves a significantly better convergence
rate compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

core problems of current machine learning. There are diverse efforts to
increase performance, such as weight norm penalty and data augmentation, but
the improvements are limited. Recently, there have been two promising
approaches to increase the worst group performance and generalization
performance, respectively. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) focuses
on the worst or hardest group to improve the worst-group performance. Besides,
sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) finds the flat minima to increase the
generalization ability on an unseen dataset. They show significant performance
improvements on the worst-group dataset and unseen dataset, respectively.
However, DRO does not guarantee flatness, and SAM does not guarantee the worst
group performance improvement. In other words, DRO and SAM may fail to increase
the worst group performance when the training and test dataset shift occurs. In
this study, we propose a new approach, the sharpness-aware group
distributionally robust optimization (SGDRO). SGDRO finds the flat-minima that
generalizes well on the worst group dataset. Different from DRO and SAM, SGDRO
contributes to improving the generalization ability even the distribution shift
occurs. We validate that SGDRO shows the smaller maximum eigenvalue and
improved performance in the worst group.

over recent years because it provides high frame rates and good image
properties. However, most linear arrays used in clinical practice have a pitch
that is equal to than the wavelength of ultrasound. Hence, the presence of
grating lobes is a concern for PWI using multiple transmit angles. The presence
of grating lobes produces clutter in images and reduces the ability to observe
tissue contrast. Techniques to reduce or eliminate the presence of grating
lobes for PWI using multiple angles will result in improved image quality. Null
subtraction imaging (NSI) is a nonlinear beamforming technique that has been
explored for improving the lateral resolution of ultrasonic imaging. However,
the apodization scheme used in NSI also eliminates or greatly reduces the
presence of grating lobes. Imaging tasks using NSI were evaluated in
simulations and physical experiments involving tissue-mimicking phantoms and
rat tumors in vivo. Images created with NSI were compared with images created
using traditional delay and sum (DAS) with Hann apodization and images created
using a generalized coherence factor (GCF). NSI was observed to greatly reduce
the presence of grating lobes in ultrasonic images, compared to DAS with Hann
and GCF, while maintaining spatial resolution and contrast in the images.
Therefore, NSI can provide a novel means of creating images using PWI with
multiple steering angles on clinically available linear arrays while reducing
the adverse effects associated with grating lobes.

However, despite successful demonstrations, efficient piezo-optomechanical

optical photons in the sideband of a pump laser field. Operating at room

learning methods for image restoration can successfully remove these artifacts.
However, most approaches are not suitable for real-time applications on mobile

  In this paper, we propose LPIENet, a lightweight network for perceptual image

show that, with much fewer parameters and operations, our model can deal with
the mentioned artifacts and achieve competitive performance compared with

including flow control, mixing, and body-force regulation. The extent of
control surface deflections introduces varying flow unsteadiness. The resulting
fluid dynamics influence the downstream flow characteristics and
fluid-structure interactions severely. In order to understand the gas dynamics,
an axisymmetric cylindrical body with a sharp-tip cone at zero angles of attack
($\alpha=0^\circ$) is examined in a free stream Mach number of $M_\infty=2.0$
and Reynolds number of $Re_{D}=2.16 \times 10^6$ ($D=50$ mm). Four static
control surface deflection angles ($\theta = \pi/36,\pi/6,\pi/3,\pi/2$, rad)
are considered around the base body. The cases are computationally investigated
through a commercial flow solver adopting a two-dimensional detached eddy
simulation (DES) strategy. Recirculation bubble length, drag coefficient's
variation, wall-static pressure statistics, acoustic loading on the model and
the surroundings, $x-t$ trajectory and $x-f$ spectral analysis, pressure
fluctuation's correlation coefficient on the model, and modal analysis are
obtained to understand the flow unsteadiness. At $\theta = [\pi/36]$, the
wall-static pressure fluctuations behind the control surface are minimal and
periodic, with a mere acoustic load of about 50 dB. At $\theta = [\pi/2]$, a
violent periodic fluctuation erupted everywhere around the control surface,
leading to a higher acoustic load of about 150 dB (3 times higher than the
previous). For $\theta = [\pi/6]$ and $[\pi/3]$, high-frequency fluctuations
with small and large-scale structures continuously shed along the reattaching
shear layer, thereby causing a broadened spectra in the control surface wake.

redshift evolution of the merger rate of PBHs in cosmic voids. The results show
that the evolution of the merger rate of PBHs has minimum sensitivity to the
redshift changes, which seems reasonable while considering the evolution of
cosmic voids. Finally, we specify the behavior of the merger rate of PBHs as a

principle allows for a 100% duty cycle, and large surface coverage thanks to
the low cost of antennas. Various detection methods of UHE particles now rely

matched by unprecedented research investment in the field from tech companies.
But, despite considerable effort from a broad range of researchers, we do not
have a rigorous mathematical theory of programmed aging. To address this, we
recently derived a mortality equation that governs the transition matrix of an
evolving population with a given maximum age. Here, we characterize the
spectrum of eigenvalues of the solution to this equation. The eigenvalues fall
into two classes. The complex and negative real eigenvalues, which we call the
flower, are always contained in the unit circle in the complex plane. They play
a negligible role in controlling the dynamics of an aging population. The
positive real eigenvalues, which we call the stem, are the only eigenvalues
which can exceed the unit circle. They control the most important properties of
the dynamics. In particular, the spectral radius increases with the maximum
allowed age. This suggests that programmed aging confers no advantage in a
constant environment. However, the spectral gap, which governs the rate of
convergence to equilibrium, decreases with the maximum allowed age. This opens
the door to an evolutionary advantage in a changing environment.

detuning parameter $\Delta$, proportional to $L_3 L_4 - L_1 L_2$, with $L_i$
denoting the $\mathbb T^4$ periods. We perform our calculations via a path
integral on a $\mathbb T^4$. Its size is taken much smaller than the inverse
strong scale $\Lambda$ and the theory is well inside the semi-classical
weak-coupling regime. The instanton background, constructed for $\Delta\ll 1$
in arXiv:hep-th/0007113, has fractional topological charge $Q=\frac{1}{2}$ and
supports two gaugino zero modes, yielding a non-vanishing bilinear condensate,
which we find to be $\Delta$-independent. Further, the theory has a mixed
discrete chiral/$1$-form center anomaly leading to double degeneracy of the
energy eigenstates on any size torus with 't Hooft twists. In particular, there
are two vacua, $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, that are exchanged under chiral
transformation. Using this information, the $\Delta$-independence of the
condensate, and assuming further that the semi-classical theory is continuously
connected to the strongly-coupled large-$\mathbb T^4$ regime, we determine the
numerical coefficient of the gaugino condensate: $\langle 0|
\mbox{tr}\lambda\lambda|0\rangle=|\langle 1|
\mbox{tr}\lambda\lambda|1\rangle|=32\pi^2 \Lambda^3$, a result equal to twice
the known $\mathbb R^4$ value. We discuss possible loopholes in the continuity

they are on the verge of gravitational collapse, they show signs of subsonic
infall motions. How extended these motions are, which depends on how the

of the envelope that surrounds the prototypical prestellar core L1544, studying
the cloud-core connection. To our aims, we observed the $\rm HCO^+$(1-0)
transition in a large map. \hcop is expected to be abundant in the envelope,
making it an ideal probe of the large-scale kinematics in the source. We
modelled the spectrum at the dust peak by means of a non
local-thermodynamical-equilibrium radiative transfer. In order to reproduce the
spectrum at the dust peak, a large ($\sim 1\, \rm pc$) envelope is needed, with
low density (tens of $\rm cm^{-3}$ at most) and contraction motions, with an
inward velocity of $\approx 0.05\,\rm km \, s^{-1}$. We fitted the data cube
using the Hill5 model, which implements a simple model {for the optical depth
and excitation temperature profiles along the line-of-sight,} in order to
obtain a map of the infall velocity. This shows that the infall motions are
extended, with typical values in the range $0.1-0.2\,\rm km \, s^{-1}$. Our
results suggest that the contraction motions extend in the diffuse envelope
surrounding the core, which is consistent with recent magnetic field
measurements in the source, which showed that the envelope is magnetically

viewed as an item relationship. However, there are multiple auxiliary item
relationships, e.g., items from similar brands and with similar contents in
real-world scenarios. Auxiliary item relationships describe item-item
affinities in multiple different semantics and alleviate the long-lasting cold
start problem in the recommendation. However, it remains a significant
challenge to model auxiliary item relationships in SR.
  To simultaneously model high-order item-item transitions in sequences and
auxiliary item relationships, we propose a Multi-relational Transformer capable
of modeling auxiliary item relationships for SR (MT4SR). Specifically, we
propose a novel self-attention module, which incorporates arbitrary item
relationships and weights item relationships accordingly. Second, we regularize
intra-sequence item relationships with a novel regularization module to
supervise attentions computations. Third, for inter-sequence item relationship
pairs, we introduce a novel inter-sequence related items modeling module.
Finally, we conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets and demonstrate the
effectiveness of MT4SR over state-of-the-art methods and the improvements on
the cold start problem. The code is available at

trained to produce rationales along with predictions, called
self-rationalization models, have been investigated for their interpretability

question. We ask whether training models to self-rationalize can aid in their
learning to solve tasks for the right reasons. Specifically, we evaluate how
training self-rationalization models with free-text rationales affects
robustness to spurious correlations in fine-tuned encoder-decoder and
decoder-only models of six different sizes. We evaluate robustness to spurious
correlations by measuring performance on 1) manually annotated challenge
datasets and 2) subsets of original test sets where reliance on spurious

self-rationalization can improve robustness to spurious correlations in
low-resource settings, it tends to hurt robustness in higher-resource settings.
Furthermore, these effects depend on model family and size, as well as on

at the cost of robustness; thus, appropriate care should be taken when training
self-rationalizing models with the goal of creating more trustworthy models.

Survey (OmegaWINGS) that covers up to the outer regions of 32 local X-ray
selected clusters. Barred galaxies are identified through a semi-automatic
analysis of ellipticity and position angle profiles. We find, in agreement with
previous studies, a strong co-dependence of the bar fraction with the galaxy
stellar mass and morphological type, being maximum for massive late-type
galaxies. The fraction of barred galaxies decreases with increasing cluster
mass and with decreasing clustercentric distance, a dependence that vanishes
once we control for morphological type, which indicates that the likelihood of
a galaxy hosting a bar in the cluster environment is determined by its
morphological transformation. At large clustercentric distances, we detect a
dependence on the distance to the nearest neighbor galaxy, suggesting that
tidal forces with close companions are able to suppress the formation of bars
or even destroy them. Barred galaxies in our sample are either early-type, star
forming galaxies located within the virial radii of the clusters or late-type
quenched galaxies found beyond the virial radii of the clusters. We propose a
scenario in which already quenched barred galaxies that fall into the clusters
are centrally rejuvenated by the interplay of the perturbed gas by ram-pressure

exponential convergence in $L^{\infty}(\pi)$ as $t\rightarrow\infty$ of the
density $\frac{d\mathcal{L}_{\mu}(X_t\lvert \tau_{\partial}>t)}{d\pi}$. We
establish this for all initial conditions $\mu$, possibly mutually singular
with respect to $\pi$, under an additional ``anti-Dobrushin'' condition. This
relies on inequalities we obtain comparing $\mathcal{L}_{\mu}(X_t\lvert
\tau_{\partial}>t)$ with the QSD $\pi$, uniformly over all initial conditions
and over the whole space, under the aforementioned conditions. On a PDE level,
these probabilistic criteria provide a parabolic boundary Harnack inequality
(with an additional caveat) for the corresponding Kolmogorov forward equation.
In addition to hypoelliptic settings, these comparison inequalities are thereby
obtained in a setting where the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation is first
order, with the possibility of discontinuous solutions. As a corollary, we
obtain a sufficient condition for a submarkovian transition kernel to have a
bounded, positive right eigenfunction, without requiring that any operator is
compact. We apply the above to the following examples (with absorption): Markov
processes on finite state spaces, degenerate diffusions satisfying parabolic
H\""{o}rmander conditions, $1+1$-dimensional Langevin dynamics, random
diffeomorphisms, $2$-dimensional neutron transport dynamics, and certain
piecewise-deterministic Markov processes. In the last case, convergence to a

large scale. Also, very few works study the underlying causal mechanisms
between factors that underpin the spillover effect. In this work, we analyse
the causal relationship between anchor stores and customer traffic to
non-anchor stores and employ a propensity score matching framework to
investigate this effect more efficiently. First of all, to demonstrate the
effect, we leverage open and mobile data from London Datastore and
Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) such as Foursquare. We then perform a
large-scale empirical analysis on customer visit patterns from anchor stores to
non-anchor stores(e.g., non-chain restaurants) located in the Greater London

tempting assumption is that models with low error should be effective at

RMSE, and an ML property model's ability to dynamically guide the iterative
(and often extrapolative) discovery of novel materials with targeted
properties. In this work, we simulate a sequential learning (SL)-guided
materials discovery process and demonstrate a decoupling between traditional
model error metrics and model performance in guiding materials discoveries. We
show that model performance in materials discovery depends strongly on (1) the
target range within the property distribution (e.g., whether a 1st or 10th
decile material is desired); (2) the incorporation of uncertainty estimates in
the SL acquisition function; (3) whether the scientist is interested in one
discovery or many targets; and (4) how many SL iterations are allowed. To
overcome the limitations of static metrics and robustly capture SL performance,
we recommend metrics such as Discovery Yield ($DY$), a measure of how many
high-performing materials were discovered during SL, and Discovery Probability

cross-modal alignment with little or no paired data, such as aligned images and
captions. Recent W-VLP methods, which pair visual features with object tags,
help achieve performances comparable with some VLP models trained with aligned
pairs in various V-L downstream tasks. This, however, is not the case in
cross-modal retrieval (XMR). We argue that the learning of such a W-VLP model
is curbed and biased by the object tags of limited semantics.
  We address the lack of paired V-L data for model supervision with a novel
Visual Vocabulary based Feature Hallucinator (WFH), which is trained via weak
supervision as a W-VLP model, not requiring images paired with captions. WFH
generates visual hallucinations from texts, which are then paired with the
originally unpaired texts, allowing more diverse interactions across
modalities.
  Empirically, WFH consistently boosts the prior W-VLP works, e.g. U-VisualBERT
(U-VB), over a variety of V-L tasks, i.e. XMR, Visual Question Answering, etc.
Notably, benchmarked with recall@{1,5,10}, it consistently improves U-VB on
image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval on two popular datasets Flickr30K and
MSCOCO. Meanwhile, it gains by at least 14.5% in cross-dataset generalization
tests on these XMR tasks. Moreover, in other V-L downstream tasks considered,
our WFH models are on par with models trained with paired V-L data, revealing
the utility of unpaired data. These results demonstrate greater generalization
of the proposed W-VLP model with WFH.

colonoscopy. Lacking high accuracy and real-time speed are the essential
obstacles to be overcome for successful clinical integration of such systems.
While literature is focused on improving accuracy, the speed parameter is often
ignored. Toward this critical need, we intend to develop a novel real-time deep
learning-based architecture, DilatedSegNet, to perform polyp segmentation on
the fly. DilatedSegNet is an encoder-decoder network that uses pre-trained
ResNet50 as the encoder from which we extract four levels of feature maps. Each
of these feature maps is passed through a dilated convolution pooling (DCP)
block. The outputs from the DCP blocks are concatenated and passed through a
series of four decoder blocks that predicts the segmentation mask. The proposed
method achieves a real-time operation speed of 33.68 frames per second with an
average dice coefficient of 0.90 and mIoU of 0.83. Additionally, we also
provide heatmap along with the qualitative results that shows the explanation
for the polyp location, which increases the trustworthiness of the method. The
results on the publicly available Kvasir-SEG and BKAI-IGH datasets suggest that
DilatedSegNet can give real-time feedback while retaining a high \ac{DSC},

attractive feature of DHNet is that it does not require the number of

a time-varying heterogeneous stochastic block model with a temporal correlation

simulations and an application to review data from Yelp, where DHNet shows
improvements both in terms of accuracy and interpretability over existing

shown to lack robustness to factors such as pose, it's unclear the extent to
which this next generation of models are more robust. To study this question,
we develop a dataset of more than 7 million images with controlled changes in
pose, position, background, lighting, and size. We study not only how robust
recent state-of-the-art models are, but also the extent to which models can
generalize variation in factors when they're present during training. We
consider a catalog of recent vision models, including vision transformers
(ViT), self-supervised models such as masked autoencoders (MAE), and models
trained on larger datasets such as CLIP. We find out-of-the-box, even today's
best models are not robust to common changes in pose, size, and background.
When some samples varied during training, we found models required a
significant portion of diversity to generalize -- though eventually robustness
did improve. When diversity is only seen for some classes however, we found

electrode in a device. Embedding a Fe atom in the porphyrin causes spin
polarization with a spin ground state $S=1$. We employ density functional
theory and nonequilibrium Green's function transport calculations to examine a
2-terminal setup involving one Fe-Por-GNR between two metal-free, small band
gap, Por-GNR electrodes. The coupling between the Fe-$d$ and GNR band states
results in a Fano anti-resonance feature in the spin transport close to the
Fermi energy. This feature makes transport highly sensitive to the Fe spin
state. We demonstrate how mechanical strain or chemical adsorption on the Fe
give rise to a spin-crossover to $S=1$ and $S=0$, respectively, directly
reflected in a change in transport. Our theoretical results provide a clue for
the on-surface synthesis of Por-GNRs hybrids, which can open a new avenue for
carbon-based spintronics and chemical sensing.

by their learning curves, but they remain poorly understood in many other
respects. ReLU-based policies result in a partitioning of the input space into
piecewise linear regions. We seek to understand how observed region counts and
their densities evolve during deep reinforcement learning using empirical
results that span a range of continuous control tasks and policy network
dimensions. Intuitively, we may expect that during training, the region density
increases in the areas that are frequently visited by the policy, thereby
affording fine-grained control. We use recent theoretical and empirical results
for the linear regions induced by neural networks in supervised learning
settings for grounding and comparison of our results. Empirically, we find that
the region density increases only moderately throughout training, as measured
along fixed trajectories coming from the final policy. However, the
trajectories themselves also increase in length during training, and thus the
region densities decrease as seen from the perspective of the current
trajectory. Our findings suggest that the complexity of deep reinforcement
learning policies does not principally emerge from a significant growth in the
complexity of functions observed on-and-around trajectories of the policy.

realized by manipulating the spin degree of freedom of charge carriers instead
of the charge degree of freedom, has captivated researchers for at least three
decades. These transistors are usually implemented by modulating the spin orbit
interaction in a two- or one-dimensional semiconductor structure with an
electrostatic potential, which then causes controlled spin precession in the
transistor's channel that modulates the current flowing between two
ferromagnetic (spin-polarized) source and drain contacts. Here, we introduce a
new concept for a spin field effect transistor whose channel is made of a
strained topological insulator
(strained-topological-insulator-field-effect-transistor or STI-SPINFET), which
does not exploit spin-orbit interaction. Instead, the transistor function is
elicited by straining the topological insulator (TI) with a gate voltage which
modifies the energy dispersion relation, or the Dirac velocity, to vary the
interference between the two spin eigenstates on the surface of the TI. This
modulates the current flowing between two ferromagnetic source and drain
contacts. The conductance on/off ratio of this transistor is too poor to be
useful as a switch, but it may have other uses, such as an extremely
energy-efficient stand-alone frequency multiplier.

$G$-Shi arrangement. The Pak-Stanley algorithm labels the regions of this
arrangement with $G_\bullet$-parking functions. When $G$ is a complete graph,
we recover the Shi arrangement, and the Pak-Stanley labels give a bijection
with ordinary parking functions. However, for proper subgraphs $G \subset K_n$,
while the Pak-Stanley labels still include every $G_{\bullet}$-parking
function, some appear more than once. These repetitions of Pak-Stanley labels
are a topic of interest in the study of $G$-Shi arrangements and
$G_{\bullet}$-parking functions. Furthermore, $G_{\bullet}$-parking functions
are connected to many other combinatorial objects (for example, superstable
configurations in chip-firing). In studying these repetitions, we can draw on
existing results about these objects such as Dhar's Burning Algorithm.
Conversely, our results have implications for the study of these objects as
well. The key insight of our work is the introduction of a combinatorial model
called the Three Rows Game. Analyzing the histories of this game and how they
induce identical outcomes lets us characterize the multiplicities of the
Pak-Stanley labels. Using this model, we develop a classification theorem for
the multiplicities of the Pak-Stanley labels of the regions in the $P_n$-Shi
arrangement, where $P_n$ is the path graph on $n$ vertices. Then, we generalize
the Three Rows Game into the $T$-Three Rows Game. This allows us to study the
multiplicities of the Pak-Stanley labels of the regions in $T$-Shi
arrangements, where $T$ is any tree. Finally, we discuss the possibilities and
difficulties in applying our method to arbitrary graphs. In particular, we
analyze multiplicities in the case when $G$ is a cycle graph, and prove a
uniqueness result for maximal $G_{\bullet}$-parking functions for all graphs
using the Three Rows Game.

for the OT problem constructed by aggregating solutions of mini-batch OT
problems. The upper bound family contains traditional mini-batch averaging at
one extreme and a tight bound found by optimal coupling of mini-batches at the
other. In between these extremes, we propose various methods to construct
bounds based on a fixed computational budget. Through various experiments, we
explore the trade-off between computational budget and bound tightness and show
the usefulness of these bounds in computer vision applications.

Asokan","On the Robustness of Dataset Inference","17 pages, 5 tables, 4 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine learning (ML) models are costly to train as they can require a
significant amount of data, computational resources and technical expertise.
Thus, they constitute valuable intellectual property that needs protection from
adversaries wanting to steal them. Ownership verification techniques allow the
victims of model stealing attacks to demonstrate that a suspect model was in
fact stolen from theirs. Although a number of ownership verification techniques
based on watermarking or fingerprinting have been proposed, most of them fall
short either in terms of security guarantees (well-equipped adversaries can
evade verification) or computational cost. A fingerprinting technique
introduced at ICLR '21, Dataset Inference (DI), has been shown to offer better
robustness and efficiency than prior methods. The authors of DI provided a
correctness proof for linear (suspect) models. However, in the same setting, we
prove that DI suffers from high false positives (FPs) -- it can incorrectly
identify an independent model trained with non-overlapping data from the same
distribution as stolen. We further prove that DI also triggers FPs in
realistic, non-linear suspect models. We then confirm empirically that DI leads
to FPs, with high confidence. Second, we show that DI also suffers from false
negatives (FNs) -- an adversary can fool DI by regularising a stolen model's
decision boundaries using adversarial training, thereby leading to an FN. To
this end, we demonstrate that DI fails to identify a model adversarially
trained from a stolen dataset -- the setting where DI is the hardest to evade.
Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings, the viability of
fingerprinting-based ownership verification in general, and suggest directions
for future work.

previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) data-driven methods for single view

from a single image or sketch, they lacked specific applications, analysis, and
experiments in the AEC. Therefore, this research addresses this gap,
introducing the first deep learning method focused only on buildings that aim
to convert a single sketch to a 3D building mesh: Vitruvio. Vitruvio adapts
Occupancy Network for SVR tasks on a specific building dataset (Manhattan 1K).
This adaptation brings two main improvements. First, it accelerates the
inference process by more than 26% (from 0.5s to 0.37s). Second, it increases
the reconstruction accuracy (measured by the Chamfer Distance) by 18%. During
this adaptation in the AEC domain, we evaluate the effect of the building

factor. While aligning all the buildings to a canonical pose improved the
overall quantitative metrics, it did not capture fine-grain details in more
complex building shapes (as shown in our qualitative analysis). Finally,
Vitruvio outputs a 3D-printable building mesh with arbitrary topology and genus

switch between Mott-Hubbard and Hund correlated states in a twisted WSe$_2$

Coulomb-interaction-driven orbital polarization and the energetics of
concomitant local singlet and triplet spin configurations. From a comparison to
recent experimental transport data, we find signatures of a filling-controlled
transition from a triplet charge-transfer insulator to a Hund-Mott metal. Our
finding establishes twisted transition metal dichalcogenides as a tunable

showing attacks that break every ML model, or defenses that withstand most
attacks. Unfortunately, little consideration is given to the actual
\textit{cost} of the attack or the defense. Moreover, adversarial samples are
often crafted in the ""feature-space"", making the corresponding evaluations of
questionable value. Simply put, the current situation does not allow to
estimate the actual threat posed by adversarial attacks, leading to a lack of
secure ML systems.
  We aim to clarify such confusion in this paper. By considering the
application of ML for Phishing Website Detection (PWD), we formalize the
""evasion-space"" in which an adversarial perturbation can be introduced to fool
a ML-PWD -- demonstrating that even perturbations in the ""feature-space"" are
useful. Then, we propose a realistic threat model describing evasion attacks
against ML-PWD that are cheap to stage, and hence intrinsically more attractive
for real phishers. Finally, we perform the first statistically validated
assessment of state-of-the-art ML-PWD against 12 evasion attacks. Our
evaluation shows (i) the true efficacy of evasion attempts that are more likely
to occur; and (ii) the impact of perturbations crafted in different
evasion-spaces. Our realistic evasion attempts induce a statistically
significant degradation (3-10% at $p\!<$0.05), and their cheap cost makes them
a subtle threat. Notably, however, some ML-PWD are immune to our most realistic
attacks ($p$=0.22). Our contribution paves the way for a much needed
re-assessment of adversarial attacks against ML systems for cybersecurity.

Importantly, we show that if the underlying private data takes values from a

offers theoretical evidence for the empirical effectiveness of DP against data

order to measure this bias, we introduce two new metrics, $\mathrm{BFAR}$ and
$\mathrm{BFRR}$, that better reflect the inherent deployment needs of Face
Recognition systems. Motivated by geometric considerations, we mitigate gender
bias through a new post-processing methodology which transforms the deep
embeddings of a pre-trained model to give more representation power to
discriminated subgroups. It consists in training a shallow neural network by
minimizing a Fair von Mises-Fisher loss whose hyperparameters account for the
intra-class variance of each gender. Interestingly, we empirically observe that
these hyperparameters are correlated with our fairness metrics. In fact,
extensive numerical experiments on a variety of datasets show that a careful
selection significantly reduces gender bias.

real-world, high-dimensional data. In a mayonnaise-like dense emulsion, the
experimentally observed motion of oil droplets shows that the fractal geometry
of the configuration space paths and energy landscape gives rise to the
anomalous random motion and cooperative rearrangements, confirming
corresponding simulations in detail. Our empirical approach allows the same

attention as they provide an efficient way for pre-trained language models
(PLMs) to adapt to a downstream task. However, these conclusions are mostly
drawn from in-domain evaluations over the full training set. In this paper, we
present comparisons between PERMs and finetuning from three new perspectives:
(1) the effect of sample and model size to in-domain evaluations, (2)
generalization to unseen domains and new datasets, and (3) the faithfulness of
generations. Our results show that for in-domain settings (a) there is a cross
point of sample size for which PERMs will perform better than finetuning when
training with fewer samples, and (b) larger PLMs have larger cross points. For
cross-domain and cross-dataset cases, we show that (a) Adapter (Houlsby et al.,
2019) performs the best amongst all the PERMs studied here, and (b) it
outperforms finetuning if the task dataset is below a certain size. We also
compare the faithfulness of generations and show that PERMs can achieve better
faithfulness score than finetuning, especially for small training set, by as
much as 6%. Finally, we apply Adapter to MT-NLG 530b (Smith et al., 2022) and
achieve new state-of-the-art results on Xsum (Narayan et al., 2018) for all
ROUGE scores (ROUGE-1 49.17, ROUGE-2 27.20, ROUGE-L 40.98).

shapes while preserving their medial features via restricted power diagram
(RPD). Medial features, including external features such as the sharp edges and
corners of the input mesh surface and internal features such as the seams and
junctions of medial axis, are important shape descriptors both topologically
and geometrically. However, existing medial axis approximation methods fail to
capture and preserve them due to the fundamentally under-sampling in the
vicinity of medial features, and the difficulty to build their correct
connections. In this paper we use the RPD of medial spheres and its affiliated
structures to help solve these challenges. The dual structure of RPD provides
the connectivity of medial spheres. The surface restricted power cell (RPC) of
each medial sphere provides the tangential surface regions that these spheres
have contact with. The connected components (CC) of surface RPC give us the
classification of each sphere, to be on a medial sheet, a seam, or a junction.
They allow us to detect insufficient sphere sampling around medial features and
develop necessary conditions to preserve them. Using this RPD-based framework,
we are able to construct high quality medial meshes with features preserved.
Compared with existing sampling-based or voxel-based methods, our method is the
first one that can preserve not only external features but also internal
features of medial axes.

objectives do not exactly reflect the retrieval scenario at inference time. In
this paper, we explore how the gap between training and inference in dense
retrieval can be reduced, focusing on dense phrase retrieval (Lee et al., 2021)
where billions of representations are indexed at inference. Since validating
every dense retriever with a large-scale index is practically infeasible, we
propose an efficient way of validating dense retrievers using a small subset of
the entire corpus. This allows us to validate various training strategies
including unifying contrastive loss terms and using hard negatives for phrase
retrieval, which largely reduces the training-inference discrepancy. As a
result, we improve top-1 phrase retrieval accuracy by 2~3 points and top-20
passage retrieval accuracy by 2~4 points for open-domain question answering.
Our work urges modeling dense retrievers with careful consideration of training
and inference via efficient validation while advancing phrase retrieval as a

  Sampling General Parametric BSDFs",,,,,"cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Parametric Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Functions (BSDFs) are
pervasively used because of their flexibility to represent a large variety of
material appearances by simply tuning the parameters. While efficient
evaluation of parametric BSDFs has been well-studied, high-quality importance
sampling techniques for parametric BSDFs are still scarce. Existing sampling
strategies either heavily rely on approximations, resulting in high variance,
or solely perform sampling on a portion of the whole BSDF slice. Moreover, many
of the sampling approaches are specifically paired with certain types of BSDFs.
In this paper, we seek an efficient and general way for importance sampling
parametric BSDFs. We notice that the nature of importance sampling is the
mapping between a uniform distribution and the target distribution.
Specifically, when BSDF parameters are given, the mapping that performs
importance sampling on a BSDF slice can be simply recorded as a 2D image that
we name as importance map. Following this observation, we accurately precompute
the importance maps using a mathematical tool named optimal transport. Then we
propose a lightweight neural network to efficiently compress the precomputed
importance maps. In this way, we have brought parametric BSDF important
sampling to the precomputation stage, avoiding heavy runtime computation. Since
this process is similar to light baking where a set of images are precomputed,
we name our method importance baking. Together with a BSDF evaluation network
and a PDF (probability density function) query network, our method enables full
multiple importance sampling (MIS) without any revision to the rendering
pipeline. Our method essentially performs perfect importance sampling. Compared
with previous methods, we demonstrate reduced noise levels on rendering results
with a rich set of appearances.

(FedRec) systems are proposed to mitigate privacy concerns to non-distributed
recommender systems. However, FedRec systems have a performance gap to its
non-distributed counterpart. The main reason is that local clients have an
incomplete user-item interaction graph, thus FedRec systems cannot utilize
indirect user-item interactions well. In this paper, we propose the Federated
Graph Recommender System (FedGRec) to mitigate this gap. Our FedGRec system can
effectively exploit the indirect user-item interactions. More precisely, in our
system, users and the server explicitly store latent embeddings for users and
items, where the latent embeddings summarize different orders of indirect
user-item interactions and are used as a proxy of missing interaction graph
during local training. We perform extensive empirical evaluations to verify the
efficacy of using latent embeddings as a proxy of missing interaction graph;

obtained with the CLAS detector and the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator
Facility 5.014~GeV electron beam. These results represent the first
measurements of the $\Lambda$ multiplicity ratio and transverse momentum
broadening as a function of the energy fraction~($z$) in the current and target
fragmentation regions. The multiplicity ratio exhibits a strong suppression at
high~$z$~and~an enhancement at~low~$z$. The measured transverse momentum
broadening is an order of magnitude greater than that seen for light mesons.
This indicates that the propagating entity interacts very strongly with the
nuclear medium, which suggests that propagation of diquark configurations in
the nuclear medium takes place at least part of the time, even at high~$z$. The
trends of these results are qualitatively described by the Giessen
Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model, particularly for the multiplicity
ratios. These observations will potentially open a new era of studies of the
structure of the nucleon as well as of strange baryons.

maximize the expected value of a function of interest without having direct
control on its features. Instead, the distribution of such features depends on
a given context and an action taken by an agent. In contrast to Bayesian
optimization, the arguments of the function are not under agent's control, but
are indirectly determined by the agent's action based on a given context. If
the information of the features is to be included in the maximization problem,
the full conditional distribution of such features, rather than its expectation
only, needs to be accounted for. Furthermore, the function is itself unknown,
only counting with noisy observations of such function, and potentially
requiring the use of unmatched data sets. We propose a novel algorithm for the
aforementioned problem which takes into consideration the uncertainty derived
from the estimation of both the conditional distribution of the features and
the unknown function, by modeling the former as a Bayesian conditional mean
embedding and the latter as a Gaussian process. Our algorithm empirically
outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithm in the experiments

The input of our problem is a set of items (e.g., medical tests) and each item
has a random state (e.g., the outcome of a medical test), whose realization is
initially unknown. One must select an item at a fixed cost in order to observe
its realization. There is an utility function which maps a subset of items and
their states to a non-negative real number. We aim to sequentially select a
group of items to achieve a ``target value'' while minimizing the maximum cost
across realizations (a.k.a. worst-case cost). To facilitate our study, we
assume that the utility function is \emph{worst-case submodular}, a property
that is commonly found in many machine learning applications. With this
assumption, we develop a tight $(\log (Q/\eta)+1)$-approximation policy, where
$Q$ is the ``target value'' and $\eta$ is the smallest difference between $Q$

PSR~J1909$-$3744, a binary MSP has been the subject of several pulsar timing
analyses. The edge-on orbit enables measurement of its mass using the Shapiro
delay; however, there is degeneracy in the sense of the inclination angle, $i$,
and multiple solutions for the longitude of ascending node, $\Omega$. Radio
pulsars scintillate due to inhomogeneities in the ionized interstellar medium
(IISM). This can result in scintillation arcs in the power spectrum of the
dynamic spectrum that can use these to study the interstellar medium and
constrain binary pulsar orbits. Here, we study the scintillation of
PSR~J1909-3744 using observations from the 64-m Parkes Radio Telescope
(Murriyang) over $\approx$13\, years, using techniques to study scintillation
in a lower signal-to-noise regime. By monitoring annual and orbital variations
of the arc-curvature measurements we are able to characterise the velocity of
the IISM. We find that the statistics of the IISM remained stationary over this
time and a slightly anisotropic model (axial ratio $\gtrsim1.2$) is preferred.
We measure the relative distance to a single dominant thin scattering screen at
$s=0.49\pm0.04$, or $D_s=590\pm50$\,pc, with an angle of anisotropy
$\zeta=85\pm6^\circ$ (East of North) and velocity in the direction of

attachment to the host cells. The hemagglutinin proteins are one of the genetic
regions of the virus with a high potential for mutations. Due to the importance
of predicting mutations in producing effective and low-cost vaccines, solutions
that attempt to approach this problem have recently gained a significant
attention. A historical record of mutations have been used to train predictive
models in such solutions. However, the imbalance between mutations and the
preserved proteins is a big challenge for the development of such models that
needs to be addressed. Here, we propose to tackle this challenge through
anomaly detection (AD). AD is a well-established field in Machine Learning (ML)
that tries to distinguish unseen anomalies from the normal patterns using only
normal training samples. By considering mutations as the anomalous behavior, we
could benefit existing rich solutions in this field that have emerged recently.
Such methods also fit the problem setup of extreme imbalance between the number
of unmutated vs. mutated training samples. Motivated by this formulation, our
method tries to find a compact representation for unmutated samples while
forcing anomalies to be separated from the normal ones. This helps the model to
learn a shared unique representation between normal training samples as much as
possible, which improves the discernibility and detectability of mutated
samples from the unmutated ones at the test time. We conduct a large number of
experiments on four publicly available datasets, consisting of 3 different
hemagglutinin protein datasets, and one SARS-CoV-2 dataset, and show the
effectiveness of our method through different standard criteria.

widely applied to various areas, such as biological gene prediction, social

backdoor attack, i.e., models trained with maliciously crafted training samples
are easily fooled by patched samples. Most of the proposed studies launch the
backdoor attack using a trigger that either is the randomly generated subgraph
(e.g., erd\H{o}s-r\'enyi backdoor) for less computational burden, or the
gradient-based generative subgraph (e.g., graph trojaning attack) to enable a
more effective attack. However, the interpretation of how is the trigger
structure and the effect of the backdoor attack related has been overlooked in
the current literature. Motifs, recurrent and statistically significant
sub-graphs in graphs, contain rich structure information. In this paper, we are
rethinking the trigger from the perspective of motifs, and propose a
motif-based backdoor attack, denoted as Motif-Backdoor. It contributes from
three aspects. (i) Interpretation: it provides an in-depth explanation for
backdoor effectiveness by the validity of the trigger structure from motifs,
leading to some novel insights, e.g., using subgraphs that appear less
frequently in the graph as the trigger can achieve better attack performance.
(ii) Effectiveness: Motif-Backdoor reaches the state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack
performance in both black-box and defensive scenarios. (iii) Efficiency: based
on the graph motif distribution, Motif-Backdoor can quickly obtain an effective
trigger structure without target model feedback or subgraph model generation.
Extensive experimental results show that Motif-Backdoor realizes the SOTA
performance on three popular models and four public datasets compared with five
baselines.

regulate kinetic process of phase evolution from Cu+-Sn4+-MOE (MOE:

found that, at the heating-up stage, Se vapor concentration is intentionally

This strategy enables the phase evolution to start at relatively higher

  Attribute Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Representing the spatial properties of facial attributes is a vital challenge
for facial attribute recognition (FAR). Recent advances have achieved the
reliable performances for FAR, benefiting from the description of spatial
properties via extra prior information. However, the extra prior information
might not be always available, resulting in the restricted application scenario
of the prior-based methods. Meanwhile, the spatial ambiguity of facial
attributes caused by inherent spatial diversities of facial parts is ignored.
To address these issues, we propose a prior-free method for attribute spatial
decomposition (ASD), mitigating the spatial ambiguity of facial attributes
without any extra prior information. Specifically, assignment-embedding module
(AEM) is proposed to enable the procedure of ASD, which consists of two
operations: attribute-to-location assignment and location-to-attribute
embedding. The attribute-to-location assignment first decomposes the feature
map based on latent factors, assigning the magnitude of attribute components on
each spatial location. Then, the assigned attribute components from all
locations to represent the global-level attribute embeddings. Furthermore,
correlation matrix minimization (CMM) is introduced to enlarge the
discriminability of attribute embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of ASD compared with state-of-the-art prior-based methods, while
the reliable performance of ASD for the case of limited training data is
further validated.

quantity to extract is the ratio $R$ between two data sets. Examples include
the lensing ratio, the interloper rate in spectroscopic redshift samples, the
decay rate of gravitational potential and $E_G$ to test gravity. However,
simply taking the ratio of the two data sets is biased, since it renders (even
statistical) errors in the denominator into systematic errors in $R$.
Furthermore, it is not optimal in minimizing statistical errors of $R$. Based
on the Bayesian analysis and the usual assumption of Gaussian error in the
data, we derive an analytical expression of the posterior PDF $P(R)$. This
result enables fast and unbiased $R$ measurement, with minimal statistical
errors. Furthermore, it relies on no underlying model other than the
proportionality relation between the two data sets. Even more generally, it
applies to the cases where the proportionality relation holds for the
underlying physics/statistics instead of the two data sets directly. It also
applies to the case of multiple ratios ($R\rightarrow {\bf
R}=(R_1,R_2,\cdots)$). We take the lensing ratio as an example to demonstrate
our method. We take lenses as DESI imaging survey galaxies, and sources as
DECaLS cosmic shear and \emph{Planck} CMB lensing. We restrict the analysis to
the ratio between CMB lensing and cosmic shear. The resulting $P(R$), for
multiple lens-shear pairs, are all nearly Gaussian. The S/N of measured $R$
ranges from $5.3$ to $8.4$. We perform several tests to verify the robustness

datasets only contain a limited number of subjects. As a result, a crucial
challenge for AU detection is addressing identity overfitting. We find that AUs

datasets often contain a large number of identities. In this paper, we aim to
utilize the expression datasets without AU labels to facilitate AU detection.
Specifically, we develop a novel AU detection framework aided by the
Global-Local facial Expressions Embedding, dubbed GLEE-Net. Our GLEE-Net
consists of three branches to extract identity-independent expression features
for AU detection. We introduce a global branch for modeling the overall facial
expression while eliminating the impacts of identities. We also design a local
branch focusing on specific local face regions. The combined output of global
and local branches is firstly pre-trained on an expression dataset as an
identity-independent expression embedding, and then finetuned on AU datasets.
Therefore, we significantly alleviate the issue of limited identities.
Furthermore, we introduce a 3D global branch that extracts expression
coefficients through 3D face reconstruction to consolidate 2D AU descriptions.
Finally, a Transformer-based multi-label classifier is employed to fuse all the
representations for AU detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the widely-used DISFA,

method helps users configure the gain-frequency responses that control the
amplification for each frequency band of the incoming sound. This paper
considers how to design effective self-fitting methods and whether we may
evaluate certain aspects of their design without resorting to expensive user
studies. Most existing fitting methods provide various user interfaces to allow
users to select a configuration from a predetermined set of presets. We propose
a novel metric for evaluating the performance of preset-based approaches by
computing their population coverage. The population coverage estimates the
fraction of users for which it is possible to find a configuration they prefer.
A unique aspect of our approach is a probabilistic model that captures how a
user's unique preferences differ from other users with similar hearing loss.
Next, we develop methods for determining presets to maximize population
coverage. Exploratory results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can
effectively select a small number of presets that provide higher population
coverage than clustering-based approaches. Moreover, we may use our algorithms
to configure the number of increments for slider-based methods.

enables one to perform multiphysics analysis directly using complex
computer-aided design (CAD) models. In this paper, we develop a novel IMGA
approach for simulating incompressible and compressible flows around complex
geometries represented by point clouds. The point cloud object's geometry is
represented using a set of unstructured points in the Euclidean space with
(possible) orientation information in the form of surface normals. Due to the
absence of topological information in the point cloud model, there are no
guarantees for the geometric representation to be watertight or 2-manifold or
to have consistent normals. To perform IMGA directly using point cloud
geometries, we first develop a method for estimating the inside-outside
information and the surface normals directly from the point cloud. We also
propose a method to compute the Jacobian determinant for the surface
integration (over the point cloud) necessary for the weak enforcement of
Dirichlet boundary conditions. We validate these geometric estimation methods
by comparing the geometric quantities computed from the point cloud with those
obtained from analytical geometry and tessellated CAD models. In this work, we
also develop thermal IMGA to simulate heat transfer in the presence of flow
over complex geometries. The proposed framework is tested for a wide range of
Reynolds and Mach numbers on benchmark problems of geometries represented by
point clouds, showing the robustness and accuracy of the method. Finally, we
demonstrate the applicability of our approach by performing IMGA on large
industrial-scale construction machinery represented using a point cloud of more
than 12 million points.

  Regularization","49 pages, 20 figures","Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 2022",,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Practitioners frequently observe that pruning improves model generalization.
A long-standing hypothesis based on bias-variance trade-off attributes this
generalization improvement to model size reduction. However, recent studies on
over-parameterization characterize a new model size regime, in which larger
models achieve better generalization. Pruning models in this over-parameterized
regime leads to a contradiction -- while theory predicts that reducing model
size harms generalization, pruning to a range of sparsities nonetheless
improves it. Motivated by this contradiction, we re-examine pruning's effect on
generalization empirically.
  We show that size reduction cannot fully account for the
generalization-improving effect of standard pruning algorithms. Instead, we
find that pruning leads to better training at specific sparsities, improving
the training loss over the dense model. We find that pruning also leads to
additional regularization at other sparsities, reducing the accuracy
degradation due to noisy examples over the dense model. Pruning extends model
training time and reduces model size. These two factors improve training and
add regularization respectively. We empirically demonstrate that both factors
are essential to fully explaining pruning's impact on generalization.

graph $G$, we need to compute the minimum number of vertices that can
disconnect $G$ after removing them. This problem is one of the most
well-studied graph problems. From 2019, a new line of work [Nanongkai et
al.~STOC'19;SODA'20;STOC'21] has used randomized techniques to break the
quadratic-time barrier and, very recently, culminated in an almost-linear time
algorithm via the recently announced maxflow algorithm by Chen et al. In
contrast, all known deterministic algorithms are much slower. The fastest
algorithm [Gabow FOCS'00] takes $O(m(n+\min\{c^{5/2},cn^{3/4}\}))$ time where
$c$ is the vertex connectivity. It remains open whether there exists a
subquadratic-time deterministic algorithm for any constant $c>3$.
  In this paper, we give the first deterministic almost-linear time vertex
connectivity algorithm for all constants $c$. Our running time is
$m^{1+o(1)}2^{O(c^{2})}$ time, which is almost-linear for all $c=o(\sqrt{\log
n})$. This is the first deterministic algorithm that breaks the $O(n^{2})$-time
bound on sparse graphs where $m=O(n)$, which is known for more than 50 years
ago [Kleitman'69]. Towards our result, we give a new reduction framework to
vertex expanders which in turn exploits our new almost-linear time construction
of mimicking network for vertex connectivity. The previous construction by
Kratsch and Wahlstr\""{o}m [FOCS'12] requires large polynomial time and is

challenges for deploying GNNs in edge devices with limited resources and model
compression techniques have drawn considerable research attention. Existing
model compression techniques such as knowledge distillation (KD) mainly focus
on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Only limited attempts have been made
recently for distilling knowledge from GNNs in an offline manner. As the
performance of the teacher model does not necessarily improve as the number of
layers increases in GNNs, selecting an appropriate teacher model will require
substantial efforts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel online
knowledge distillation framework called Alignahead++ in this paper.
Alignahead++ transfers structure and feature information in a student layer to
the previous layer of another simultaneously trained student model in an
alternating training procedure. Meanwhile, to avoid over-smoothing problem in
GNNs, deep supervision is employed in Alignahead++ by adding an auxiliary
classifier in each intermediate layer to prevent the collapse of the node
feature embeddings. Experimental results on four datasets including PPI, Cora,
PubMed and CiteSeer demonstrate that the student performance is consistently
boosted in our collaborative training framework without the supervision of a
pre-trained teacher model and its effectiveness can generally be improved by
increasing the number of students.

untranslated words but relatively insensitive to gender manipulation, while
COMET is much more sensitive to word repetition than to aspectual changes). We

However, preparing a squeezed cat state with high generation rate, and

high-performance all-optical in-line squeezer is developed to prepare a

scheme has the advantages that the phase of the quadrature squeezing of the
squeezed cat state can be manipulated by changing the working condition of the
squeezer, and that a higher generation rate can be achieved via the
deterministic squeezing operation of the in-line squeezer. The generation rate
of squeezed cat states reaches 2 kHz, the same as that of the initial cat

of electro-optic and opto-electric conversions necessary for an off-line

quality, when compared to a reference state of the art non-streaming approach.
Our method consists of first streaming the encoder in real time while the
speaker is speaking. Then, as soon as the speaker stops speaking, we run the
spectrogram decoder in streaming mode along the side of a streaming vocoder to
generate output speech. To achieve an acceptable delay-quality trade-off, we
propose a novel hybrid approach for look-ahead in the encoder which combines a
look-ahead feature stacker with a look-ahead self-attention. We show that our
streaming approach is almost 2x faster than real time on the Pixel4 CPU.

leading to biased recommendations. The wide application of recommender systems
makes studying the defense against attack necessary. Among existing defense
methods, data-processing-based methods inevitably exclude normal samples, while
model-based methods struggle to enjoy both generalization and robustness.
Considering the above limitations, we suggest integrating data processing and
robust model and propose a general framework, Triple Cooperative Defense (TCD),
which cooperates to improve model robustness through the co-training of three
models. Specifically, in each round of training, we sequentially use the
high-confidence prediction ratings (consistent ratings) of any two models as
auxiliary training data for the remaining model, and the three models
cooperatively improve recommendation robustness. Notably, TCD adds pseudo label
data instead of deleting abnormal data, which avoids the cleaning of normal
data, and the cooperative training of the three models is also beneficial to
model generalization. Through extensive experiments with five poisoning attacks
on three real-world datasets, the results show that the robustness improvement
of TCD significantly outperforms baselines. It is worth mentioning that TCD is
also beneficial for model generalizations.

networks (WANs) with the deployment of new network sites and datacenters,
making it challenging for commercial optimization engines to solve the network
traffic engineering (TE) problem quickly at scale. Current approaches to
accelerating TE optimization decompose the task into subproblems that can be
solved in parallel using optimization solvers, but they are fundamentally
restricted to a few dozen subproblems in order to balance run time and TE
performance, achieving limited parallelism and speedup.
  Motivated by the ability to readily access thousands of threads on GPUs
through modern deep learning frameworks, we propose a learning-based TE
algorithm -- Teal, which harnesses the parallel processing power of GPUs to
accelerate TE control. First, Teal designs a flow-centric graph neural network
(GNN) to capture WAN connectivity and model network flows, learning flow
features as inputs to the downstream allocation. Second, to reduce the problem
scale and make learning tractable, Teal employs a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm to allocate each traffic demand independently toward
optimizing a central TE objective. Finally, Teal fine-tunes the resulting flow
allocations using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), a highly
parallelizable constrained optimization algorithm for reducing constraint
violations (e.g., overused links).
  We evaluate Teal on traffic matrices collected from a global cloud provider,
and show that on a large WAN topology with over 1,700 nodes, Teal generates
near-optimal flow allocations while being several orders of magnitude faster
than the production optimization engine. Compared with other TE acceleration
schemes, Teal satisfies up to 29% more traffic demands and yields up to 109x
speedups.

their characteristic signatures on an initially coherent finite amplitude

is necessary to consider inhomogeneity and efficiency jointly in optimization
studies. Three-dimensional (3D) multiphysics models validated with experiments
can simulate the inhomogeneity in a reliable manner, but they are unsuitable
for optimization due to the high computational cost. This study proposes a
method that combines segmented SOEC experiments, multiphysics simulation, and
artificial intelligence to optimize the inhomogeneity and efficiency of SOEC
jointly. A 3D cell model is first built and verified by segmented SOEC
experiments. Then, fast neural network surrogate models are built from the
simulation data and integrated into a multi-objective optimization problem. Its
solutions form a Pareto front reflecting the conflicting relationships among
different objectives. It is found that the down-stream current is 60%-65% of
the up-stream current when the steam utilization is 0.7. To increase the steam
utilization to 0.8, the down-stream current will further drop to 50%-60% of the
up-stream current. The Pareto fronts enable system operators to achieve a

their biological plausibility and leverage their promising energy efficiency.
Throughout existing SNNs, the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model is commonly
adopted to formulate the spiking neuron and evolves into numerous variants with
different biological features. However, most LIF-based neurons support only
single biological feature in different neuronal behaviors, limiting their
expressiveness and neuronal dynamic diversity. In this paper, we propose GLIF,
a unified spiking neuron, to fuse different bio-features in different neuronal

gating factors, which are exploited to determine the proportion of the fused
bio-features, are learnable during training. Combining all learnable
membrane-related parameters, our method can make spiking neurons different and
constantly changing, thus increasing the heterogeneity and adaptivity of
spiking neurons. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate
that our method obtains superior performance compared with other SNNs by simply
changing their neuronal formulations to GLIF. In particular, we train a spiking
ResNet-19 with GLIF and achieve $77.35\%$ top-1 accuracy with six time steps on
CIFAR-100, which has advanced the state-of-the-art. Codes are available at

optical flow to be spatially smooth. This becomes our student network, named as
\textsc{GlobalFlowNet}. Then, using the original optical flow network as the
teacher network, we train the student network using a robust loss function.
Given a trained \textsc{GlobalFlowNet}, we stabilize videos using a two stage

using a quadratic programming approach constrained by a user-specified cropping

information to reduce the signaling overhead, and facilitates sharing of access
resources to enhance access efficiency. However, some challenges remain to be
addressed in the receiver design, such as unknown identity of active users and
multi-user interference (MUI) on shared access resources. In this work, we deal
with the problem of joint user activity and data detection for grant-free
random access. Specifically, the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm is
first employed to mitigate MUI and decouple the signals of different users.
Then, we extend the data symbol alphabet to incorporate the null symbols from
inactive users. In this way, the joint user activity and data detection problem
is formulated as a clustering problem under the Gaussian mixture model.
Furthermore, in conjunction with the AMP algorithm, a variational Bayesian
inference based clustering (VBIC) algorithm is developed to solve this
clustering problem. Simulation results show that, compared with state-of-art
solutions, the proposed AMP-combined VBIC (AMP-VBIC) algorithm achieves a

  Spatial Disparities in Managed and Hazard-Induced Power Outages","23 pages, 6 Figures, 2 Tables",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The energy sector in the United States is ever more vulnerable to extreme
climatic hazards, leading to multiple hazard-induced and managed power outages.
Utility companies reportedly prioritize the restoration of power systems based
on the number of outages and the size of affected populations. This approach
fails to account for unequal impacts. Research in equitable infrastructure
emphasizes that certain populations, such as lower income and racial-ethnic
minority households, are disproportionately impacted by disruptions in the
power system. Moreover, connected network qualities of the power system
suggests an element of spatial vulnerabilities. However, little empirical
evidence exists regarding the presence and extent of energy inequality. A main
roadblock is the data collection process, in that outage data is often
perishable and not found at granular spatial scales to allow the undertaking of
a comprehensive analysis. Recognizing this important gap, this study collected
and analyzed observational data related to Winter Storm Uri (2021) and
Hurricane Ida (2021). In the managed outages of Winter Storm Uri, census tracts
with lower income and more Hispanic households had a higher median duration of
outages. In the hazard-induced outages of Hurricane Ida, zip codes with lower
income and more black households had a higher median duration of power outages.
Both the managed and hazard-induced outages had moderate levels of spatial
inequality as shown through the spatial Gini and infrastructure index analyses.
The findings provide evidence of pervasive social and spatial inequality in
power outages during climate hazards and highlight the importance of
integrating equity into the manner in which utility managers and emergency
planners restore power outages.

mostly addressed it in the context of structured, well-defined segments, such
as segmentation into paragraphs, chapters, or segmenting text that originated
from multiple sources. We tackle the task of segmenting running (spoken)
narratives, which poses hitherto unaddressed challenges. As a test case, we
address Holocaust survivor testimonies, given in English. Other than the
importance of studying these testimonies for Holocaust research, we argue that
they provide an interesting test case for topical segmentation, due to their
unstructured surface level, relative abundance (tens of thousands of such
testimonies were collected), and the relatively confined domain that they
cover. We hypothesize that boundary points between segments correspond to low
mutual information between the sentences proceeding and following the boundary.
Based on this hypothesis, we explore a range of algorithmic approaches to the
task, building on previous work on segmentation that uses generative Bayesian
modeling and state-of-the-art neural machinery. Compared to manually annotated
references, we find that the developed approaches show considerable
improvements over previous work.

three possible kinds of transformations, i.e., a topological phase transition

different phase in which the bulk spectrum is gapless. Thanks to the strong
interplay between driving and intrinsic energy scales of the system, all the
found phases and transitions are highly controllable via tuning a single
hopping parameter of the system. Our discovery not only enriches the possible

morphological features of core collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants are post-kick
jets, i.e., the neutron star (NS) launches these jets after the explosion and
after it acquired its natal kick velocity. I find that this assumption implies
that the pre-collapse cores of CCSN progenitors have sufficient angular
momentum fluctuations to support jittering jets that explode the star. From the
finding that the shaping-jets neither tend to be aligned with the kick velocity
nor to be perpendicular to it I argue that the assumption that the shaping-jets
are post-kick jets has the following implications. (1) The NS accretes mass at
a radius of ~5000km from the center of the explosion at ~10 s after explosion.
(2) The required angular momentum fluctuations of the accreted gas to explain
the medium values of jets-kick angles are also sufficient to support an
intermittent pre-kick accretion disk, just before and during the explosion.
Such an intermittent accretion disk is likely to launch jets that explode the
star in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism. This suggests that
most likely the shaping-jets are the last jets in the jittering jets explosion
mechanism rather than post-kick jets. (3) The jittering jets explosion
mechanism expects that black holes have small natal kick velocities.

the relevant band edges at the $K/K^{\prime}$ valleys of the proximitized

from 0{\deg} to 30{\deg}, we find a transition of the TMDC valence band (VB)
edge exchange splitting from about $-2$ to $2$ meV, while the conduction band
(CB) edge exchange splitting remains nearly unchanged at around $-3$ meV. For
the VB of WSe$_2$ (MoSe$_2$) on CrI$_3$, the exchange coupling changes sign at
around 8{\deg} (16{\deg}). We find that even at the angles with almost zero
spin splittings of the VB, the real-space spin polarization profile of holes at

orbitals. Furthermore, a giant tunability of the proximity-induced exchange
coupling is provided by a transverse electric field of a few V/nm. We
complement our \textit{ab initio} results by calculating the excitonic valley
splitting to provide experimentally verifiable optical signatures of the
proximity exchange. Specifically, we predict that the valley splitting
increases almost linearly as a function of the twist angle. Furthermore, the
proximity exchange is highly tunable by gating, allowing to tailor the valley
splitting in the range of 0 to 12 meV in WSe$_2$/CrI$_3$, which is equivalent

in supine positions. Meanwhile, the limitation of the systems is that it is
difficult to evacuate the patients in case of emergency (e.g., patient
discomfort and system failure) because the patients are restricted between the
robot system and bed. Then, it is ideal that the patient undergoes the
examination in the sitting position in terms of safety. Therefore, we validated
a feasibility study of seated-style echocardiography using a robot. Method:
Preliminary experiments were conducted to verify the following two points: (1)
the possibility of obtaining cardiac disease features in the sitting posture as
well as in the conventional examination, and (2) the relationship between
posture angle and physical burden. For reducing the physical burden, two unique
mechanisms were incorporated into the system: (1) a leg pendulum base mechanism
to reduce the load on the legs when the lateral bending angle increases, and
(2) a roll angle division by a lumbar lateral bending and thoracic rotation
mechanisms. Results: Preliminary results demonstrated that adjusting the
diagnostic posture angle enabled us to obtain the views, including cardiac
disease features, as in the conventional examination. The results showed that
the body burden increased as the posture's lateral bending angle increased. The
results also demonstrated that the body load reduction mechanism incorporated
in the results could reduce the physical load in the seated echocardiography.
Conclusion: These results showed the potential of the seated-style
echocardiography robot.

filter pruning, the cross-domain performance will decay to a large extent. As
scoring a filter's importance is one of the central problems for pruning, we
design the importance scoring estimation by using the variance of domain-level
risks to consider the pruning risk in the unseen distribution. As such, we can
remain more domain generalized filters. The experiments show that under the

importance of soaking has not yet been studied, and the surfactants' role in
stabilizing MoS2 nanosheets is poorly understood1. Herein, we report a novel
approach to exfoliating large quantities of MoS2 via high-pressure (HP)
liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) in deionized (DI) water. 4 to 7 layers of MoS2
nanosheets were obtained from 60 days-soaked samples and they were found to be
stable in solvents for periods of up to six months. Studies on the effect of
three surfactants, namely sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate (SDBS), sodium
cholate (SC), and tetra-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB), indicate that
exfoliation of MoS2 nanosheets in SDBS is highly efficient than the other two
surfactants. The estimated yield reaches up to 7.25%, with a nanosheet
concentration of 1.45 mg/ml, which is one of the highest ever reported. Our
studies also suggest that the nanosheets' concentration and the lateral size
depend on exfoliation cycles, applied pressure and surfactant concentration.
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and ion-transport study show that the
nanosheets prepared by our method are stable in an acidic medium and free from
surfactants. A high hydrogen evolution rate of 30.13 mmol g-1 h-1 was estimated
under ambient laboratory conditions.

learning with data assimilation to reconstruct the dynamics of a physical model

model of the dynamical system based on those estimated states. The surrogate
model can be defined as an hybrid combination where a physical model based on
prior knowledge is enhanced with a statistical model estimated by a neural
network. The training of the neural network is typically done offline, once a
large enough dataset of model state estimates is available. By contrast, with
online approaches the surrogate model is improved each time a new system state
estimate is computed. Online approaches naturally fit the sequential framework
encountered in geosciences where new observations become available with time.
In a recent methodology paper, we have developed a new weak-constraint 4D-Var
formulation which can be used to train a neural network for online model error
correction. In the present article, we develop a simplified version of that
method, in the incremental 4D-Var framework adopted by most operational weather
centres. The simplified method is implemented in the ECMWF Object-Oriented
Prediction System, with the help of a newly developed Fortran neural network
library, and tested with a two-layer two-dimensional quasi geostrophic model.
The results confirm that online learning is effective and yields a more
accurate model error correction than offline learning. Finally, the simplified
method is compatible with future applications to state-of-the-art models such
as the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.

stratification, among other factors, it is not always straightforward to
determine the magnetic field structures from observed polarization. We review
these effects and their impact on polarization emission at a variety of
wavelengths, including radio, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths in this
paper. It is also possible to study the magnetic field in the launching and
acceleration regions of AGN jets by using very long baseline interferometry
(VLBI), which occurs on a small physical scale. Due to the weak polarization of
the jets in these regions, probing the magnetic field is generally difficult.
However, recent VLBI observations have detected significant polarization and
Faraday rotation in some nearby sources. We present the results of these
observations as well as prospects for future observations. Additionally, we
briefly discuss recently developed polarization calibration and imaging
techniques for VLBI data, which enable more in-depth analysis of the magnetic

$U(1)$ gauge field through Chern-Simons interactions. Because of parity
violating interactions, one polarization of the gauge field is amplified
yielding to enhanced curvature perturbation power spectrum. Inflation proceeds
in multiple stages as each pseudo-scalar field rolls towards its minimum
yielding to distinct multiple peaks in the curvature perturbations power
spectrum at various scales during inflation. The localized peaks in power
spectrum generate Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) which can furnish a large
fraction of Dark Matter (DM) abundance. In addition, gravitational waves (GWs)
with non-trivial spectra are generated which are in sensitivity range of
various forthcoming GW observatories.

Chinese text. Existing research aims to enhance the text representation and use
multi-source information to improve the detection and correction capabilities
of models, but does not pay too much attention to improving their ability to
distinguish between confusable words. Contrastive learning, whose aim is to
minimize the distance in representation space between similar sample pairs, has
recently become a dominant technique in natural language processing. Inspired
by contrastive learning, we present a novel framework for Chinese spelling
checking, which consists of three modules: language representation, spelling
check and reverse contrastive learning. Specifically, we propose a reverse
contrastive learning strategy, which explicitly forces the model to minimize
the agreement between the similar examples, namely, the phonetically and
visually confusable characters. Experimental results show that our framework is
model-agnostic and could be combined with existing Chinese spelling check
models to yield state-of-the-art performance.

With the large-scale datasets, we hope to leverage the representation power of
deep models such as CNNs to solve the stroke extraction task, which, however,
remains an open question. To this end, we turn the stroke extraction problem

temporal information between channels in the feature map, and finally achieves
the efficient fusion of inter-frame information. Extensive experimental results

Klibanoff, Marinacci and Mukerji (2005) in incomplete financial markets, which
concerns with the portfolio selection under smooth ambiguity. The decision
maker (DM) is uncertain about the dominated priors of the financial market,
which are characterized by a second-order distribution (SOD). The KMM model
separates risk attitudes and ambiguity attitudes apart and the aim of the DM is
to maximize the two-fold utility of terminal wealth, which does not belong to
the classical subjective utility maximization problem. By constructing the
efficient frontier, the original KMM problem is first simplified as an one-fold
expected utility problem on the second-order space. In order to solve the
equivalent simplified problem, this paper imposes an assumption and introduces
a new distorted Legendre transformation to establish the bipolar relation and
the distorted duality theorem. Then, under a further assumption that the
asymptotic elasticity of the ambiguous attitude is less than 1, the uniqueness
and existence of the solution to the KMM problem are shown and we obtain the
semi-explicit forms of the optimal terminal wealth and the optimal strategy.
Explicit forms of optimal strategies are presented for CRRA, CARA and HARA
utilities in the case of Gaussian SOD in a Black-Scholes financial market,
which show that DM with higher ambiguity aversion tends to be more concerned
about extreme market conditions with larger bias. In the end of this work,
numerical comparisons with the DMs ignoring ambiguity are revealed to
illustrate the effects of ambiguity on the optimal strategies and value
functions.

spin-$1$ model. It exhibits an excitation gap and an exponentially decaying
correlation function, with fractionalized excitations at its boundaries. So
far, the one-dimensional AKLT model has only been experimentally realized with
trapped-ions as well as photonic systems. In this work, we successfully
prepared the AKLT state on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era
quantum device for the first time. In particular, we developed a
non-deterministic algorithm on the IBM quantum processor, where the non-unitary
operator necessary for the AKLT state preparation is embedded in a unitary
operator with an additional ancilla qubit for each pair of auxiliary
spin-1/2's. Such a unitary operator is effectively represented by a
parametrized circuit composed of single-qubit and nearest-neighbor $CX$ gates.
Compared with the conventional operator decomposition method from Qiskit, our
approach results in a much shallower circuit depth with only nearest-neighbor
gates, while maintaining a fidelity in excess of $99.99\%$ with the original
operator. By simultaneously post-selecting each ancilla qubit such that it
belongs to the subspace of spin-up $|\uparrow \rangle$, an AKLT state can be
systematically obtained by evolving from an initial trivial product state of
singlets plus ancilla qubits in spin-up on a quantum computer, and it is
subsequently recorded by performing measurements on all the other physical
qubits. We show how the accuracy of our implementation can be further improved

regression analyses. A major issue in implementing the GLS is estimation of the
conditional variance function of the error term, which typically requires a
restrictive functional form assumption for parametric estimation or tuning
parameters for nonparametric estimation. In this paper, we propose an
alternative approach to estimate the conditional variance function under
nonparametric monotonicity constraints by utilizing the isotonic regression
method. Our GLS estimator is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the
infeasible GLS estimator with knowledge of the conditional error variance, and
is free from tuning parameters, not only for point estimation but also for
interval estimation or hypothesis testing. Our analysis extends the scope of
the isotonic regression method by showing that the isotonic estimates, possibly
with generated variables, can be employed as first stage estimates to be
plugged in for semiparametric objects. Simulation studies illustrate excellent
finite sample performances of the proposed method. As an empirical example, we
revisit Acemoglu and Restrepo's (2017) study on the relationship between an
aging population and economic growth to illustrate how our GLS estimator
effectively reduces estimation errors.

possible to learn agent behaviors without interacting with the environment.
However, depending on the quality of the offline dataset, such pre-trained

online by interacting with the environment. During online fine-tuning, the
performance of the pre-trained agent may collapse quickly due to the sudden

offline RL methods such as a behaviour cloning loss prevent this to an extent,
these constraints also significantly slow down online fine-tuning by forcing
the agent to stay close to the behavior policy. We propose to adaptively weigh
the behavior cloning loss during online fine-tuning based on the agent's

is assessed by the contact orientational order, $\tilde{Q}_{\ell}$, that
quantifies the contribution of each contact configuration (Large-Large,
Small-Small, Large-Small, Small-Large) in the jammed structure. The partial
values of $\tilde{Q}_{\ell}$ are calculated with respect to known ordered

that the packing undergoes a structural transition at $\phi_J$, manifested by a
sudden jump in the partial $\tilde{Q}_{\ell}$. Each contact configuration
contributes to the jammed structure in a different way, changing with $\delta$
and concentration of small particles, $X_{\mathrm{S}}$. The results show not
only that the packing undergoes a structural change upon jamming, but also that
bidisperse packings exhibit local HCP and FCC structures also found in
monodisperse packings. This suggests that the jammed structure of bidisperse

datasets with small-scale feature spaces (the feature space dimension $\approx$
the label space), the existing LDL algorithms do not perform well. To address
this issue, we seek to model the uncertainty augmentation of the feature space
to alleviate the problem in LDL tasks. Specifically, we start with augmenting
each feature value in the feature vector of a sample into a vector (sampling on
a Gaussian distribution function). Which, the variance parameter of the
Gaussian distribution function is learned by using a sub-network, and the mean
parameter is filled by this feature value. Then, each feature vector is
augmented to a matrix which is fed into a mixer with local attention
(\textit{TabMixer}) to extract the latent feature. Finally, the latent feature
is squeezed to yield an accurate label distribution via a squeezed network.
Extensive experiments verify that our proposed algorithm can be competitive

deployment of multiple robots for collaborative mapping. Each robot explores a
section of the environment and communicates onboard pose estimates and maps to
a central server to build an optimized global multi-robot map. Naturally,
inconsistencies can arise between onboard and server estimates due to onboard
odometry drift, failures, or degeneracies. The mapping server can correct and
overcome such failure cases using computationally expensive operations such as
inter-robot loop closure detection and multi-modal mapping. However, the
individual robots do not benefit from the collaborative map if the mapping
server provides no feedback. Although server updates from the multi-robot map
can greatly alleviate the robotic mission strategically, most existing work
lacks them, due to their associated computational and bandwidth-related costs.
Motivated by this challenge, this paper proposes a novel collaborative mapping
framework that enables global mapping consistency among robots and the mapping
server. In particular, we propose graph spectral analysis, at different spatial
scales, to detect structural differences between robot and server graphs, and
to generate necessary constraints for the individual robot pose graphs. Our
approach specifically finds the nodes that correspond to the drift's origin
rather than the nodes where the error becomes too large. We thoroughly analyze
and validate our proposed framework using several real-world multi-robot field

recover the onboard estimation from localization failures and even from the
degeneracies within its estimation.

modeling human movement and have applications in biomechanics, animation, and
the footwear industry. The problem is that previous body part models are
trained using 3D scans that are isolated to the individual parts. Such data
does not capture the full range of motion for such parts, e.g. the motion of
head relative to the neck. Our observation is that full-body scans provide
important information about the motion of the body parts. Consequently, we
propose a new learning scheme that jointly trains a full-body model and
specific part models using a federated dataset of full-body and body-part
scans. Specifically, we train an expressive human body model called SUPR
(Sparse Unified Part-Based Human Representation), where each joint strictly
influences a sparse set of model vertices. The factorized representation
enables separating SUPR into an entire suite of body part models. Note that the
feet have received little attention and existing 3D body models have highly
under-actuated feet. Using novel 4D scans of feet, we train a model with an
extended kinematic tree that captures the range of motion of the toes.
Additionally, feet deform due to ground contact. To model this, we include a
novel non-linear deformation function that predicts foot deformation
conditioned on the foot pose, shape, and ground contact. We train SUPR on an
unprecedented number of scans: 1.2 million body, head, hand and foot scans. We
quantitatively compare SUPR and the separated body parts and find that our
suite of models generalizes better than existing models. SUPR is available at

the modified KdV equation, Mizukawa, Nakajima, and Yamada made a conjecture on
2-reduced Schur functions and Schur's Q-functions. The conjecture claims that
certain sums of products of a Littlewood-Richardson coefficient and two
2-reduced Schur functions are equal to Schur's Q-functions up to a scalar
multiple. In this paper we give a proof of the conjecture in cases which have
not been proved yet. We introduce a new expression of Schur's Q-functions and
use it to prove the conjecture. Combinatorics of the inverse Kostka matrix is
also used. We also provide consideration of the conjecture in general case.

and projects. Data collection procedures do not always involve careful
utilization of the most precise instruments and strictest protocols. As a
consequence, data are invariably affected by imprecision and sometimes sharply
varying levels of quality of the data. Different mathematical representations
of imprecision have been suggested, including a classical approach to censored
data which is considered optimal when the proposed error model is correct, and
a weaker approach called interval statistics based on partial identification
that makes fewer assumptions. Maximizing the quality of statistical results is
often crucial to the success of many engineering projects, and a natural
question that arises is whether data of differing qualities should be pooled
together or we should include only precise measurements and disregard imprecise
data. Some worry that combining precise and imprecise measurements can
depreciate the overall quality of the pooled data. Some fear that excluding
data of lesser precision can increase their overall uncertainty about results
because lower sample size implies more sampling uncertainty. This paper
explores these concerns and describes simulation results that show when it is
advisable to combine fairly precise data with rather imprecise data by
comparing analyses using different mathematical representations of imprecision.
Pooling data sets is preferred when the low-quality data set does not exceed a
certain level of uncertainty. However, so long as the data are random, it may
be legitimate to reject the low-quality data if its reduction of sampling
uncertainty does not counterbalance the effect of its imprecision on the
overall uncertainty.

that, by design, existing NLP task definitions for fact-checking cannot refute
misinformation as professional fact-checkers do for the majority of claims. We
then define two requirements that the evidence in datasets must fulfill for
realistic fact-checking: It must be (1) sufficient to refute the claim and (2)
not leaked from existing fact-checking articles. We survey existing
fact-checking datasets and find that all of them fail to satisfy both criteria.
Finally, we perform experiments to demonstrate that models trained on a
large-scale fact-checking dataset rely on leaked evidence, which makes them
unsuitable in real-world scenarios. Taken together, we show that current NLP
fact-checking cannot realistically combat real-world misinformation because it
depends on unrealistic assumptions about counter-evidence in the data.

Wasserstein distances, and (3) mainly apply to elementary schemes such as

Wasserstein distances can be reduced to the study of their continuous-time

assumptions of MCMC sampling, our theory immediately yields the last-iterate

absolute energy $\log E$, transverse momentum $\log p_T$ and relative

all the others, meanwhile adding relative coordinates information

requirement in quantum information technologies, playing a crucial role in
quantum computation, quantum error correction, and fundamental tests of
non-locality. Readout of the spin state of an optically active emitter can be
achieved by driving a spin-preserving optical transition and detecting the
emitted photons. The speed and fidelity of this approach is typically limited
by a combination of low photon collection rates and measurement back-action.
Here, we demonstrate single-shot optical readout of a semiconductor quantum dot
spin state, achieving a readout time of only a few nanoseconds. In our
approach, gated semiconductor quantum dots are embedded in an open microcavity.
The Purcell enhancement generated by the microcavity increases the photon
creation rate from one spin state but not from the other, as well as
efficiently channelling the photons into a well-defined detection mode. We
achieve single-shot readout of an electron spin state in 3 nanoseconds with a
fidelity of (95.2$\pm$0.7)%, and observe quantum jumps using repeated
single-shot measurements. Owing to the speed of our readout, errors resulting
from measurement-induced back-action have minimal impact. Our work reduces the
spin readout-time to values well below both the achievable spin relaxation and
dephasing times in semiconductor quantum dots, opening up new possibilities for
their use in quantum technologies.

fiber for each pixel in the image. In principle, this can be reduced to a
single multimode optical fiber (MMF), the width of a human hair, with one fiber
spatial-mode per image pixel. However, images transmitted through a MMF emerge
as unrecognisable speckle patterns due to dispersion and coupling between the
spatial modes of the fiber. Furthermore, speckle patterns change as the fiber
undergoes bending, making the use of MMFs in flexible imaging applications even
more complicated. In this paper, we propose a real-time imaging system using
flexible MMFs, but which is robust to bending. Our approach does not require
access or feedback signal from the distal end of the fiber during imaging. We
leverage a variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct and classify images
from the speckles and show that these images can still be recovered when the
bend configuration of the fiber is changed to one that was not part of the
training set. We utilize a MMF $300$ mm long with a 50 $\mu$m core for imaging
$10\times 10$ cm objects placed approximately at $20$ cm from the fiber and the
system can deal with a change in fiber bend of 50$^\circ$ and range of movement

are discarded as containing no face. In contrast, the proposed tracker
preserves information about the number of classification stages passed by each
window. Such information is used to build a likelihood map, which represents
the probability of having a face located at that position. Tracking
capabilities are provided by extrapolating the position of the likelihood map
to the next frame by optical flow computation. The proposed algorithm works in
real time on a standard laptop. The system is verified on the Boston Head
Tracking Database, showing that the proposed algorithm outperforms the standard
Viola Jones detector in terms of detection rate and stability of the output

A natural question to ask is when given an arbitrary Cartesian differential

In this paper, we provide characterisations of cofree Cartesian differential
categories without specifying a base category. The key to these
characterisations are, surprisingly, maps whose derivatives are zero, which we
call differential constants. One characterisation is in terms of an enrichment
over complete ultrametric spaces, where the metric is induced by differential
constants and is similar to the metric for power series. Another
characterisation is as algebras of a monad. In either characterisation, the
base category is the category of differential constants. We also discuss other
basic properties of cofree Cartesian differential categories, such as the
linear maps, and explain how many well-known Cartesian differential categories

amenable to high-throughput implementations and thus represents a promising
solution for meeting the ultra-high peak data rate of future communication
systems. However, for polar codes, the error-correcting performance of BP
decoding is far inferior to that of the widely used CRC-aided successive
cancellation list (SCL) decoding algorithm. To close the performance gap to
SCL, BP list (BPL) decoding expands the exploration of candidate codewords
through multiple permuted factor graphs (PFGs). From an implementation
perspective, designing a unified and flexible hardware architecture for BPL
decoding that supports various PFGs and code configurations presents a big
challenge. In this paper, we propose the first hardware implementation of a BPL
decoder for polar codes and overcome the implementation challenge by applying a
hardware-friendly algorithm that generates flexible permutations on-the-fly.
First, we derive the graph selection gain and provide a sequential generation
(SG) algorithm to obtain a near-optimal PFG set. We further prove that any
permutation can be decomposed into a combination of multiple fixed routings,
and we design a low-complexity permutation network to satisfy the decoding
schedule. Our BPL decoder not only has a low decoding latency by executing the
decoding and permutation generation in parallel, but also supports an arbitrary
list size without any area overhead. Experimental results show that, for
length-1024 polar codes with a code rate of one-half, our BPL decoder with 32
PFGs has a similar error-correcting performance to SCL with a list size of 4

problem of medical diagnosis. However, a more clinically relevant question that
practitioners usually face is how to predict the future trajectory of a
disease. Current methods for prognosis or disease trajectory forecasting often
require domain knowledge and are complicated to apply. In this paper, we
formulate the prognosis prediction problem as a one-to-many prediction problem.
Inspired by a clinical decision-making process with two agents -- a radiologist
and a general practitioner -- we predict prognosis with two transformer-based
components that share information with each other. The first transformer in
this framework aims to analyze the imaging data, and the second one leverages
its internal states as inputs, also fusing them with auxiliary clinical data.
The temporal nature of the problem is modeled within the transformer states,
allowing us to treat the forecasting problem as a multi-task classification,
for which we propose a novel loss. We show the effectiveness of our approach in
predicting the development of structural knee osteoarthritis changes and
forecasting Alzheimer's disease clinical status directly from raw multi-modal
data. The proposed method outperforms multiple state-of-the-art baselines with
respect to performance and calibration, both of which are needed for real-world
applications. An open-source implementation of our method is made publicly

such as framerate, resolution, and bit-depth boost the demand to devise a

essential for Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH)-based content
provisioning as it requires encoding numerous representations of the same video
content. High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is one standard video codec that
significantly improves encoding efficiency over its predecessor Advanced Video
Coding (AVC). This improvement is achieved at the expense of significantly
increased time complexity, which is a challenge for content and service
providers. As various representations are the same video content encoded at
different bitrates or resolutions, the encoding analysis information from the
already encoded representations can be shared to accelerate the encoding of
other representations. Several state-of-the-art schemes first encode a single
representation, called a reference representation. During this encoding, the
encoder creates analysis metadata with information such as the slicetype
decisions, CU, PU, TU partitioning, and the HEVC bitstream itself. The
remaining representations, called dependent representations, analyze the above
metadata and then reuse it to skip searching some partitioning, thus, reducing
the computational complexity. With the emergence of cloud-based encoding
services, video encoding is accelerated by utilizing an increased number of
resources, i.e., with multi-core CPUs, multiple representations can be encoded
in parallel. This paper presents an overview of a wide range of multi-encoding
schemes with and without the support of machine learning approaches integrated
into the HEVC Test Model (HM) and x265, respectively.

latter is particularly important given the Sun's highly intermittent and
dynamic nature that involves a plethora of processes occurring over extended
ranges in spatial and temporal scales. Realistic forward modelling of the Sun
therefore requires time-dependent three-dimensional radiation
magnetohydrodynamics that account for non-equilibrium effects and, typically as
a separate step, detailed radiative transfer calculations, resulting in
synthetic observables that can be compared to observations. Such artificial
observations sometimes also account for instrumental and seeing effects, which,
in addition to aiding the interpretation of observations, provide instructive
tools for designing and optimising ALMA's solar observing modes. In the other

interest from researchers worldwide. They provide more detailed information
about an observed area and allow an accurate target detection and precise
discrimination of objects compared to classical RGB and multispectral images.
Despite the great potentialities of hyperspectral technology, the analysis and
exploitation of the large volume data remain a challenging task. The existence
of irrelevant redundant and noisy images decreases the classification accuracy.
As a result, dimensionality reduction is a mandatory step in order to select a
minimal and effective images subset. In this paper, a new filter approach
normalized mutual synergy (NMS) is proposed in order to detect relevant bands
that are complementary in the class prediction better than the original
hyperspectral cube data. The algorithm consists of two steps: images selection
through normalized synergy information and pixel classification. The proposed
approach measures the discriminative power of the selected bands based on a
combination of their maximal normalized synergic information, minimum
redundancy and maximal mutual information with the ground truth. A comparative
study using the support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN)
classifiers is conducted to evaluate the proposed approach compared to the
state of art band selection methods. Experimental results on three benchmark
hyperspectral images proposed by the NASA ""Aviris Indiana Pine"", ""Salinas"" and
""Pavia University"" demonstrated the robustness, effectiveness and the
discriminative power of the proposed approach over the literature approaches.

this temperature range, showing metallic or doped-degenerate semiconducting
behaviour. Notably, this behaviour of the Seebeck coefficient is in contrast to
Mott VRH conduction as observed in resistivity. The steady increase in
resistivity and S with the sharp decrease in thermal conductivity between 410 K

system properties (e.g. resonance frequency), a multi-objective performance
goal and optimal PID parameter values. Performance is demonstrated in the
context of a real optical switching product of the foremost manufacturer of
such devices globally. Switching is handled by piezoelectric actuators where
switching time and optical loss are derived from the speed and stability of
actuator-control processes respectively. The method achieves a $5\times$
improvement in the number of actuators that fall within the most challenging
target switching speed, $\geq 20\%$ improvement in mean switching speed at the
same optical loss and $\geq 75\%$ reduction in performance inconsistency when
temperature varies between 5 and 73 degrees celcius. Furthermore, once trained
(which takes $\mathcal{O}(hours)$), the model generates actuator-unique PID

assortative in terms of adoption but represent different levels of
assortativity of network centralities, we demonstrate that the Top Candidate

going to a nearby place. However, little research has paid attention to it,
i.e., the differentiated effects of built environment on the bike-sharing
demand with trip lengths. To fill the gap, this paper identifies a threshold of
bike-sharing trip lengths from bike-sharing trace data, and employs a
semiparametric geographically weighted Poisson regression (SGWPR) model to
investigate the relationship between built environment and bike-sharing demand
with different lengths considering the heterogeneity in the relationship. The
results show that built environment has heterogeneous effects on the

reported in an archetypal plastic crystal, adamantane. Adamantane has a
colossal isothermally reversible entropy change of 106 J K-1 kg-1 . Extremely
low hysteresis means that this can be accessed at pressure differences less
than 200 bar. Configurational entropy can only account for about 40% of the
total entropy change; the remainder is due to vibrational effects. Using
neutron spectroscopy and supercell lattice dynamics calculations, it is found
that this vibrational entropy change is mainly caused by softening in the
high-entropy phase of acoustic modes that correspond to molecular rotations. We
attribute this behaviour to the contrast between an 'interlocked' state in the
low-entropy phase and sphere-like behaviour in the high-entropy phase. Although
adamantane is a simple van der Waals solid with near-spherical molecules, this
approach can be leveraged for the design of more complex barocaloric molecular

GAN-based approaches have been widely used to address this problem due to their

training instability and mode collapse. We propose a simple yet efficient

the limitations of GAN models while outperforming them. Unlike previous
reconstruction-based works that only utilize reconstruction error or generated
samples, our proposed method simultaneously incorporates both of them in the

subnetworks, an autoencoder, and a binary classifier. The autoencoder learns
the representation of the positive class by reconstructing them. Then, the
model creates negative and connected positive examples using real and generated
samples. Negative instances are generated via manipulating the real data, so
their distribution is close to the positive class to achieve a more accurate
boundary for the classifier. To boost the robustness of the detection to
reconstruction error, connected positive samples are created by combining the
real and generated samples. Finally, the binary classifier is trained using
connected positive and negative examples. We demonstrate a considerable

spatial-search algorithm on a two-dimensional (2D) square spatial grid,
realized with a 2D Dirac discrete-time quantum walk (DQW) coupled to a Coulomb
electric field centered on the marked node. In such a walk, the electric term
acts as the oracle of the algorithm, and the free walk (i.e., without electric
term) acts as the ""diffusion"" part, as it is called in Grover's algorithm. The
results are the following. First, we run simulations of this electric Dirac DQW
during longer times than explored in Ref.\ \cite{ZD21}, and observe that there
is a second localization peak around the node marked by the oracle, reached in
a time $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the number of nodes of the 2D grid, with a
localization probability scaling as $O(1/\ln N)$. This matches the
state-of-the-art 2D DQW search algorithms before amplitude amplification. We
then study the effect of adding noise on the Coulomb potential, and observe
that the walk, especially the second localization peak, is highly robust to
spatial noise, more modestly robust to spatiotemporal noise, and that the first
localization peak is even highly robust to spatiotemporal noise.

low loads but a distinct velocity dependence. Here we combine mesoscopic
simulations and experiments to test the polymer-relaxation hypothesis for this
velocity dependence, where a velocity-dependent regime emerges when the
perturbation of interfacial polymer chains occurs faster than their relaxation
at high velocity. Our simulations reproduce the experimental findings, with
speed-independent friction at low velocity, followed by a friction coefficient
that rises with velocity to some power of order unity. We show that the
velocity-dependent regime is characterized by reorientation and stretching of
polymer chains in the direction of shear, leading to an entropic stress that
can be quantitatively related to the shear response. The detailed exponent of
the power law in the velocity dependent regime depends on how chains interact:
We observe a power close to $1/2$ for chains that can stretch, while pure
reorientation leads to a power of unity. Our simulations quantitatively match
experiments and show that the velocity dependence of hydrogel friction at low
loads can be firmly traced back to the morphology of near-surface chains.

difficult due to the wide variety of detection frameworks and training

flexible environment to implement and compare attention-based FSOD methods. The
proposed framework focuses on attention mechanisms and is divided into three
modules: spatial alignment, global attention, and fusion layer. To remain
competitive with existing methods, which often leverage complex training, we
propose new augmentation techniques designed for object detection. Using this
framework, several FSOD methods are reimplemented and compared. This comparison
highlights two distinct performance regimes on aerial and natural images: FSOD
performs worse on aerial images. Our experiments suggest that small objects,
which are harder to detect in the few-shot setting, account for the poor
performance. Finally, we develop a novel multiscale alignment method,
Cross-Scales Query-Support Alignment (XQSA) for FSOD, to improve the detection
of small objects. XQSA outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly on DOTA

and more specifically, on the speed of gene drive invasion (if successful). We
considered various timings of gene conversion (in the zygote or in the
germline) and different probabilities of gene conversion (instead of assuming
100$\%$ conversion as done in a previous work). We compared the types of
propagation when the intrinsic growth rate of the population takes extreme
values, either very large or very low. When it is infinitely large, the wave
can be either successful or not, and, if successful, it can be either pulled or
pushed, in agreement with previous studies (extended here to the case of
partial conversion). In contrast, it cannot be pushed when the intrinsic growth
rate is vanishing. In this case, analytical results are obtained through an
insightful connection with an epidemiological SI model. We conducted extensive
numerical simulations to bridge the gap between the two regimes of large and
low growth rate. We conjecture that, if it is pulled in the two extreme
regimes, then the wave is always pulled, and the wave speed is independent of
the growth rate. This occurs for instance when the fitness cost is small
enough, or when there is stable coexistence of the drive and the wild-type in
the population after successful drive invasion. Our model helps delineate the
conditions under which demographic dynamics can affect the spread of a gene
drive.

stars: a brown dwarf (TOI-2336b) and two objects near the hydrogen burning mass
limit (TOI-1608b and TOI-2521b). These three systems were first identified
using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). TOI-2336b has
a radius of $1.05\pm 0.04\ R_J$, a mass of $69.9\pm 2.3\ M_J$ and an orbital
period of 7.71 days. TOI-1608b has a radius of $1.21\pm 0.06\ R_J$, a mass of
$90.7\pm 3.7\ M_J$ and an orbital period of 2.47 days. TOI-2521b has a radius
of $1.01\pm 0.04\ R_J$, a mass of $77.5\pm 3.3\ M_J$ and an orbital period of
5.56 days. We found all these low-mass companions are inflated. We fitted a
relation between radius, mass and incident flux using the sample of known
transiting brown dwarfs and low-mass M dwarfs. We found a positive correlation
between the flux and the radius for brown dwarfs and for low-mass stars that is
weaker than the correlation observed for giant planets.

syntactic choice. While prior work has shown that a number of factors (e.g.,
information status, dependency length, and syntactic surprisal) influence Hindi
word order preferences, the role of discourse predictability is underexplored
in the literature. Inspired by prior work on syntactic priming, we investigate
how the words and syntactic structures in a sentence influence the word order
of the following sentences. Specifically, we extract sentences from the
Hindi-Urdu Treebank corpus (HUTB), permute the preverbal constituents of those
sentences, and build a classifier to predict which sentences actually occurred
in the corpus against artificially generated distractors. The classifier uses a
number of discourse-based features and cognitive features to make its
predictions, including dependency length, surprisal, and information status. We
find that information status and LSTM-based discourse predictability influence
word order choices, especially for non-canonical object-fronted orders. We
conclude by situating our results within the broader syntactic priming
literature.

policies in multi-agent settings. Unlike single-agent settings, the
generalization of policies should also consider the influence of other agents.
Besides, with the increasing number of entities in multi-agent settings, more
agent-entity interactions are needed for language grounding, and the enormous
search space could impede the learning process. Moreover, given a simple
general instruction,e.g., beating all enemies, agents are required to decompose
it into multiple subgoals and figure out the right one to focus on. Inspired by
previous work, we try to address these issues at the entity level and propose a
novel framework for language grounding in multi-agent reinforcement learning,
entity divider (EnDi). EnDi enables agents to independently learn subgoal
division at the entity level and act in the environment based on the associated
entities. The subgoal division is regularized by opponent modeling to avoid
subgoal conflicts and promote coordinated strategies. Empirically, EnDi
demonstrates the strong generalization ability to unseen games with new
dynamics and expresses the superiority over existing methods.

  Properties","To be published in Materials Today Physics",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Half-Heusler (HH) phases have garnered much attention as thermally stable and
non-toxic thermoelectric materials for power conversion. The most studied
alloys to date utilize Hf, Zr, and Ti as the base components. These alloys can
achieve a moderate dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, near 1. Recent studies
have advanced the thermoelectric performance of HH alloys by employing
nanostructures and novel compositions to achieve larger ZT, reaching as high as
1.5. Herein, we report that traditional alloying techniques applied to the
conventional HfZr-based half-Heusler alloys can also lead to exceptional ZT.
Specifically, we present the well-studied p-type Hf0.3Zr0.7CoSn0.3Sb0.7,
previously reported to have a ZT~0.8, resonantly doped with less than 1 at. %
metallic Al on the Sn/Sb site, touting a remarkable ZT near 1.5 at 980 K. This
is achieved through a significant increase in power factor, by ~65%, and a
notable but smaller decrease in thermal conductivity, by ~13%, at high
temperatures. These favorable thermoelectric properties are discussed in terms
of a local anomaly in the density of states near the Fermi energy designed to
enhance the Seebeck coefficient, as revealed by first-principles calculations,
as well as the emergence of a highly heterogeneous grain structure that can
scatter phonons across different length scales, effectively suppressing the
thermal conductivity. Consequently, the effective mass is significantly
enhanced from ~ 7 to 10me within a single parabolic band model, consistent with
the result from first-principles calculations. The discovery of high ZT in a
commonly studied half-Heusler alloy through a conventional and non-complex
approach opens a new path for further discoveries in similar types of alloys.
Furthermore, it is reasonable to believe that the study will reinvigorate
effort in exploring high thermoelectric performance in conventional alloy
systems.

$\mathfrak{p}\in X$ inside of another initial data set $(X,\gamma,k)$, under a

converge back to $(\gamma,k)$. The initial data we construct enjoy
polyhomogeneous regularity jointly in $\epsilon$ and the (rescaled) spatial

reproduce the dynamics of most astrophysical systems at different scales
without invoking non-baryonic dark matter (DM). There is, however, a
long-standing unsolved problem when MOND is applied to rich clusters of
galaxies in the form of a deficit (by a factor around two) of predicted
dynamical mass derived from the virial theorem with respect to observations. In
this article we approach the virial theorem using the velocity dispersion of
cluster members along the line of sight rather than using the cluster
temperature from X-ray data and hydrostatic equilibrium. Analytical
calculations of the virial theorem in clusters for Newtonian gravity+DM and
MOND are developed, applying pressure (surface) corrections for non-closed
systems. Recent calibrations of DM profiles, baryonic ratio and baryonic
($\beta $ model or others) profiles are used, while allowing free parameters to
range within the observational constraints. It is shown that solutions exist
for MOND in clusters that give similar results to Newton+DM -- particularly in
the case of an isothermal $\beta $ model for $\beta =0.55-0.70$ and core radii
$r_c$ between 0.1 and 0.3 times $r_{500}$ (in agreement with the known data).
The disagreements found in previous studies seem to be due to the lack of
pressure corrections (based on inappropriate hydrostatic equilibrium
assumptions) and/or inappropriate parameters for the baryonic matter profiles.

we propose a \textit{projection-free} augmented Lagrangian-based method, in
which primal updates are carried out using a \textit{weak proximal oracle}
(WPO). In an earlier work, WPO was shown to be more powerful than the standard
\textit{linear minimization oracle} (LMO) that underlies conditional
gradient-based methods (aka Frank-Wolfe methods). Moreover, WPO is
computationally tractable for many high-dimensional problems of interest,
including those motivated by recovery of low-rank matrices and tensors, and
optimization over polytopes which admit efficient LMOs. The main result of this
paper shows that under a certain curvature assumption (which is weaker than
strong convexity), our WPO-based algorithm achieves an ergodic rate of
convergence of $O(1/T)$ for both the objective residual and feasibility gap.
This result, to the best of our knowledge, improves upon the $O(1/\sqrt{T})$

proof of work-based DLTs. For example, the IOTA DLT, built upon a directed
acyclic graph (DAG) architecture, uses an alternative consensus mechanism that
requires significantly less energy than other DLTs. Because the (DLT) space is
constantly and rapidly evolving, the question of how much energy DLTs actually
consume demands to be continuously studied and answered. Previous research into
the energy consumption of the IOTA network has shown that an optimization in
the overall protocol correlates to an optimization in energy consumption. The

to further optimize the protocol by removing the network's centralized
Coordinator. This report presents the results of measuring the energy

findings of this report are that the IOTA 2.0 research prototype shows both
improvements and increase in the energy consumption metrics compared to the

PBFT with dynamic nodes is called a dynamic PBFT. Clearly, the dynamic PBFT can
more strongly support the decentralization and distributed structure of
blockchain. However, analyzing dynamic PBFT blockchain systems will become more
interesting and challenging.
  In this paper, we propose a large-scale Markov modeling technique to analyze
the dynamic PBFT voting processes and its dynamic PBFT blockchain system. To
this end, we set up a large-scale Markov process (and further a
multi-dimensional Quasi-Birth-and-Death (QBD) process) and provide performance
analysis for both the dynamic PBFT voting processes and the dynamic PBFT
blockchain system. In particular, we obtain an effective computational method
for the throughput of the complicated dynamic PBFT blockchain system. Finally,
we use numerical examples to check the validity of our theoretical results and
indicate how some key system parameters influence the performance measures of
the dynamic PBFT voting processes and of the dynamic PBFT blockchain system.
Therefore, by using the theory of multi-dimensional QBD processes and the
RG-factorization technique, we hope that the methodology and results developed
in this paper shed light on the study of dynamic PBFT blockchain systems such
that a series of promising research can be developed potentially.

any undesirable feature-label correlations. However, a correlation can be
undesirable because (i) the feature is irrelevant to the label (e.g.
punctuation in a review), or (ii) the feature's effect on the label depends on
the context (e.g. negation words in a review), which is ubiquitous in language
tasks. In case (i), we want the model to be invariant to the feature, which is
neither necessary nor sufficient for prediction. But in case (ii), even an
ideal model (e.g. humans) must rely on the feature, since it is necessary (but
not sufficient) for prediction. Therefore, a more fine-grained treatment of
spurious features is needed to specify the desired model behavior. We formalize
this distinction using a causal model and probabilities of necessity and
sufficiency, which delineates the causal relations between a feature and a

that enables this is the extension of the SNIP to the boundary case to obtain
efficient time-domain implementations of matrix all-pass filters as matrix

In particular, whereas traditional population-based search methods such as
evolutionary algorithms (EAs) draw much power from crossover operations, it is
difficult to take advantage of them in NAS. The main obstacle is believed to be
the permutation problem: The mapping between genotype and phenotype in
traditional graph representations is many-to-one, leading to a disruptive
effect of standard crossover. This paper presents the first theoretical
analysis of the behaviors of mutation, crossover and RL in black-box NAS, and
proposes a new crossover operator based on the shortest edit path (SEP) in

permutation problem, and as a result, have a better expected improvement
compared to mutation, standard crossover and RL. Further, it empirically
outperform these other methods on state-of-the-art NAS benchmarks. The SEP
crossover therefore allows taking full advantage of population-based search in

current antibiotic market suffers from various shortcomings, including the

issue of traditional antibiotics arises from the inherent properties of these
small molecules being mostly broad-spectrum and non-programmable. As the
scientific knowledge of microbes progresses, the scientific community is
starting to explore entirely novel approaches to tackling antimicrobial

tasks, our theoretical understanding of its success is still very restricted.
One of the key challenges is the overparametrized nature of modern models,
enabling complete overfitting of the data even if the labels are randomized,
i.e. networks can completely \textit{memorize} all given patterns. While such a
memorization capacity seems worrisome, in this work we show that under training
protocols that include \textit{data augmentation}, neural networks learn to
memorize entirely random labels in a benign way, i.e. they learn embeddings
that lead to highly non-trivial performance under nearest neighbour probing. We
demonstrate that deep models have the surprising ability to separate noise from
signal by distributing the task of memorization and feature learning to
different layers. As a result, only the very last layers are used for
memorization, while preceding layers encode performant features which remain
largely unaffected by the label noise. We explore the intricate role of the
augmentations used for training and identify a memorization-generalization
trade-off in terms of their diversity, marking a clear distinction to all
previous works. Finally, we give a first explanation for the emergence of
benign memorization by showing that \textit{malign} memorization under data
augmentation is infeasible due to the insufficient capacity of the model for
the increased sample size. As a consequence, the network is forced to leverage
the correlated nature of the augmentations and as a result learns meaningful
features. To complete the picture, a better theory of feature learning in deep
neural networks is required to fully understand the origins of this phenomenon.

related to a selected factor usually differ. Therefore, a fitted model may not
be sparse, which makes the model interpretation difficult. To obtain a sparse
solution of the Group Lasso we propose the following two-step procedure: first,
we reduce data dimensionality using the Group Lasso; then to choose the final
model we use an information criterion on a small family of models prepared by
clustering levels of individual factors. We investigate selection correctness
of the algorithm in a sparse high-dimensional scenario. We also test our method
on synthetic as well as real datasets and show that it performs better than the
state of the art algorithms with respect to the prediction accuracy or model
dimension.

lane-free depending on the degree of lane-discipline. This distinction holds
true only if motorcycles are neglected in lane-based traffic. In cities, as
opposed to highways, this is an oversimplification and it would be more
accurate to speak of hybrid situations, where lane discipline can be made
mode-dependent. Empirical evidence shows that cars follow the lanes as defined
by the infrastructure, while motorcycles do not necessarily adhere to
predefined norms and may participate in self-organized formation of virtual
lanes. This phenomenon is the result of complex interactions between different
traffic participants competing for limited space. In order to better understand
the dynamics of modal interaction microscopically, we first analyze empirical
data from detailed trajectories obtained by the pNEUMA experiment and observe
patterns of mixed traffic. Then, we propose a hybrid model for multimodal
vehicular traffic. The hybrid model is inspired by the pedestrian flow
literature, featuring collision-free and anticipatory properties, and we
demonstrate that it is able to reproduce empirical observations from aerial

how the mass, radius, and tidal deformability relations differ from those of
general relativity. We find that tidal Love numbers and tidal deformabilities
can differ significantly from those in general relativity ( $>200\%$ in strong

same iteration convergence rate with respect to $T$ as other state-of-the-art
(SOTA) parallel stochastic algorithms, it converges faster with respect to
run-time due to its wait-free structure. Our experimental results demonstrate
that SWIFT's run-time is reduced due to a large reduction in communication time
per epoch, which falls by an order of magnitude compared to synchronous
counterparts. Furthermore, SWIFT produces loss levels for image classification,

high pressure and temperature experimental results with a comprehensive
database of previous experiments to re-examine the systematics of Mo and W
partitioning. W partitioning is particularly sensitive to silicate and metallic
melt compositions and becomes more siderophile with increasing temperature. We
show that W has a 6+ oxidation state in silicate melts over the full
experimental fO2 range of $\Delta$IW -1.5 to -3.5. Mo has a 4+ oxidation state
and its partitioning is less sensitive to silicate melt composition, but also
depends on metallic melt composition. DMo stays approximately constant with
increasing depth in Earth. Both W and Mo become more siderophile with
increasing C content of the metal, so we fit epsilon interaction parameters. W
and Mo along with C are incorporated into a combined N-body accretion and
core-mantle differentiation model. We show that W and Mo require the early
accreting Earth to be sulfur-depleted and carbon-enriched so that W and Mo are
efficiently partitioned into Earth's core and do not accumulate in the mantle.
If this is the case, the produced Earth-like planets possess mantle
compositions matching the BSE for all simulated elements. However, there are
two distinct groups of estimates of the bulk mantle's C abundance in the
literature: low (100 ppm), and high (800 ppm), and all models are consistent
with the higher estimated carbon abundance. The low BSE C abundance would be
achievable when the effects of the segregation of dispersed metal droplets

consistently achieve acceptable results. All DL algorithms are robust to
geometric configurations of stereo pairs and are less sensitive in comparison

each spectral bin and classify it as sinusoidal, transient, or noise. This
paper proposes an enhanced three-way decomposition method based on fuzzy logic,
enabling soft masking while preserving the perfect reconstruction property. The
proposed method allows each spectral bin to simultaneously belong to two
classes, sine and noise or transient and noise. Results of a subjective
listening test against three other techniques are reported, showing that the
proposed decomposition yields a better or comparable quality. The main
improvement appears in transient separation, which enjoys little or no loss of
energy or leakage from the other components and performs well for test signals
presenting strong transients. The audio quality of the separation is shown to
depend on the complexity of the input signal for all tested methods. The
proposed method helps improve the quality of various audio processing

$V$, $|V|=2n$, consisting of $n$ pairwise disjoint edges. There are three
different ordered matchings of size two on $V=[4]$: an alignment
$\{1,2\},\{3,4\}$, a nesting $\{1,4\},\{2,3\}$, and a crossing
$\{1,3\},\{2,4\}$. Accordingly, there are three basic homogeneous types of
ordered matchings (with all pairs of edges arranged in the same way) which we
call, respectively, lines, stacks, and waves.
  We prove an Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres type result guaranteeing in every ordered
matching of size $n$ the presence of one of the three basic sub-structures of a
given size. In particular, one of them must be of size at least $n^{1/3}$. We
also investigate the size of each of the three sub-structures in a random
ordered matching. Additionally, the former result is generalized to $3$-uniform
ordered matchings.
  Another type of unavoidable patterns we study are twins, that is, pairs of
order-isomorphic, disjoint sub-matchings. By relating to a similar problem for
permutations, we prove that the maximum size of twins that occur in every
ordered matching of size $n$ is $O\left(n^{2/3}\right)$ and
$\Omega\left(n^{3/5}\right)$. We conjecture that the upper bound is the correct
order of magnitude and confirm it for almost all matchings. In fact, our
results for twins are proved more generally for $r$-multiple twins, $r\ge2$.

machine learning for modeling dynamical systems. However, very limited studies
have been conducted on seismic wave modeling tasks. A critical challenge is
that these geophysical problems are typically defined in large domains (i.e.,
semi-infinite), which leads to high computational cost. In this paper, we
present a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) model for seismic wave
modeling in semi-infinite domain without the nedd of labeled data. In specific,
the absorbing boundary condition is introduced into the network as a soft
regularizer for handling truncated boundaries. In terms of computational
efficiency, we consider a sequential training strategy via temporal domain
decomposition to improve the scalability of the network and solution accuracy.
Moreover, we design a novel surrogate modeling strategy for parametric loading,
which estimates the wave propagation in semin-infinite domain given the seismic
loading at different locations. Various numerical experiments have been
implemented to evaluate the performance of the proposed PINN model in the
context of forward modeling of seismic wave propagation. In particular, we
define diverse material distributions to test the versatility of this approach.
The results demonstrate excellent solution accuracy under distinctive

addresses the unique challenges of log-based extraction by (a)~identifying

thorough experimental analysis shows that OneProvenance can improve extraction

  frequency and tidal field). Accepted for publication in ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.HE gr-qc nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is currently unknown if neutron stars (NSs) are composed of nucleons only
or are hybrid stars, i.e., in addition to nucleonic crusts and outer cores,
they also possess quark cores. Quantum chromodynamics allows for such a
possibility, but accurate calculations relevant for compact stars are still
elusive. Here we investigate some crust-breaking aspects of hybrid stars. We
show that the crust-breaking frequency and maximum fiducial ellipticity are
sensitive to the quark-hadron density jump and equation of state stiffness.
Remarkably, the crust-breaking frequency related to static tides scales
linearly with the mass of the star (for a given companion's mass), and its
slope encompasses information about the microphysics of the star. However, for
precise crust-breaking frequency predictions, relativistic corrections to
Kepler's third law and the Newtonian tidal field should not be ignored. When a
liquid quark core touches an elastic hadronic phase (the result of a
significant energy-density jump), the maximum ellipticity can increase around
an order of magnitude when compared to a liquid quark core touching a liquid
hadronic phase. That is relevant because it would increase the odds of
detecting continuous gravitational waves from NSs. Our order-of-magnitude
analysis also suggests that a given upper limit to the
ellipticity(crust-breaking frequency) could have representatives in stars with
either small or intermediate(large) energy-density jumps. Therefore, when upper
limits to the ellipticity for isolated stars are better constrained or
electromagnetic radiation (e.g., gamma-ray precursors) is detected along with
gravitational waves in inspiraling binary systems, they may help constrain some
aspects of phase transitions in NSs.

The distribution of $\rm{DM_{host}}$ shows significant differences at $z=0$
between two populations: the stellar mass model exhibits an excess at the low
DM end with respect to the SFR model. The SFR (stellar mass) model has a median
value of $\rm{DM_{host}}$=179 (63) $\rm{pc\, cm^{-3}}$ for galaxies with
$M_*=10^{8-13}\,M_{\odot}$ in the TNG100-1. Galaxies in the Illustris-1 have a
much smaller $\rm{DM_{host}}$. The distributions of $\rm{DM_{host}}$ deviate
from log-normal function for both models. Furthermore, two populations differ
moderately in the spatial offset from host galaxy's center, in the stellar mass
function of hosts. $\rm{DM_{host}}$ increases with the stellar mass of hosts
when $M_*<10^{10.5}\,M_{\odot}$, and fluctuate at higher mass. At $0<z<2$,
$\rm{DM_{host}}$ increases with redshift. The differences in $\rm{DM_{host}}$
between two populations declines with increasing redshift. With more localized
events available in the future, statistics such as $\rm{DM_{host}}$, the offset
from galaxy center and the stellar mass function of hosts will be of great
helpful to ascertain the origin of FRB. Meanwhile, statistics of
$\rm{DM_{host}}$ of localized FRB events could help to constrain the baryon

and measure the degree of scribal appropriation that took place when ms. B was
copied off the exemplar ms. A. After this, we will discuss the results
obtained, focusing on the scribal variation that can be found both at the level
of individual words and n-grams. To this end, we use machine learning to
identify the most distinctive features that separate manuscript A from B.
Finally, we look at possible diachronic trends in the appropriation by B's
scribe of his exemplar. We argue that scribal takeovers in the exemplar impacts
the practice of the copying scribe, while transitions to a different content
matter cause little to no effect.

astrophysics. When black holes are surrounded by matter fields, there will be
plenty of phenomena which can have observational consequences, from which we
can learn about the matter fields as well as black hole spacetime. In this
work, we investigate the massive scalar field in the vicinity of a newly
proposed rotating regular black hole inspired by quantum gravity. We will
especially investigate how this non-singular spactime will affect the
superradiance instability and quasinormal modes of the scalar filed. We derive
the superradiant conditions and the amplification factor by using the
Matching-asymptotic Method, and the quasinormal modes are computed through
Continued Fraction Method. In the Kerr limit, the results are in excellent
agreements with previous research. We also demonstrate how the quasinormal
modes will change as a function of black hole spin, regularity described by a
parameter $k$ and scalar field mass respectively, with other parameters taking
specific values.

  Neural Nets","Accepted to ICLR 2023, 9 pages, 2 figures plus supplementary",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Overparameterization in deep learning typically refers to settings where a
trained neural network (NN) has representational capacity to fit the training
data in many ways, some of which generalize well, while others do not. In the
case of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), there exists an additional layer of
overparameterization, in the sense that a model may exhibit many solutions that
generalize well for sequence lengths seen in training, some of which
extrapolate to longer sequences, while others do not. Numerous works have
studied the tendency of Gradient Descent (GD) to fit overparameterized NNs with
solutions that generalize well. On the other hand, its tendency to fit
overparameterized RNNs with solutions that extrapolate has been discovered only
recently and is far less understood. In this paper, we analyze the
extrapolation properties of GD when applied to overparameterized linear RNNs.
In contrast to recent arguments suggesting an implicit bias towards short-term
memory, we provide theoretical evidence for learning low-dimensional state
spaces, which can also model long-term memory. Our result relies on a dynamical
characterization which shows that GD (with small step size and near-zero
initialization) strives to maintain a certain form of balancedness, as well as
on tools developed in the context of the moment problem from statistics
(recovery of a probability distribution from its moments). Experiments
corroborate our theory, demonstrating extrapolation via learning
low-dimensional state spaces with both linear and non-linear RNNs.

restrictions on certain activities for a period of time following treatment to
optimise protection of the public and ensure the legal dose limit is not
exceeded. Software may be used to calculate necessary restriction periods for
an individual based on longitudinal dose rate measurements from the time of
radiopharmaceutical administration. A spreadsheet program has been used for
this purpose in Australian hospitals for the last two decades. However, this
spreadsheet has a limitation in that it uses an approximation in the
calculation of dose from a contact pattern, which affects the calculated
restriction period. A computer program called Dorn was developed that provides
the same functionality as the spreadsheet but without this approximation.
Proffered radiation safety advice from Dorn and the spreadsheet were compared.
Approach. Advice from the spreadsheet and Dorn were compared for 55 patients
who underwent iodine-131 therapy for differentiated thyroid cancer. Main
results. The restriction periods for caring for infants, close contact with
children and sleeping with a partner were typically about 13 hours longer in
Dorn than in the spreadsheet, but in some cases were over a week shorter or a
month longer. Significance. If the Dorn program is used clinically in place of
the spreadsheet, some patients will enjoy shorter restriction periods and the
therapy provider can be more confident in their compliance with regulatory
requirements and best practice. Dorn is freely available from

Furthermore, different vectorizations and distance measures in combination with

arrangement of materials with contrasting properties, which can be designed to

the Mindlin-Reissner plate theory and have been extensively used to analyze the

characteristics of PCs may be sufficient for simple elastic structures,
analyzing the evanescent wave behavior becomes fundamental if the PC contains
viscoelastic components. Another complication is that increasingly intricate
material distributions in the unit cell of PCs with hierarchical configuration
may render the calculation of the complex band structure (i.e., considering
both propagating and evanescent waves) prohibitive due to excessive
computational workload. In this work, we propose a new extended plane wave
expansion formulation to compute the complex band structure of thick PC plates
with arbitrary material distribution using the Mindlin-Reissner plate theory

Kelvin-Voigt model. We apply the method to investigate the evanescent behavior
of periodic hierarchically structured plates for either (i) a hard purely

increase in the hierarchical order leads to a weight reduction with relatively
preserved attenuation characteristics, including attenuation peaks due to
locally resonant modes that present a decrease in attenuation upon increasing
viscosity levels. For (ii), changing the hierarchical order implies in opening
band gaps in distinct frequency ranges, with an overall attenuation improved by
an increase in the viscosity levels.

applications is having a reliable measure of confidence in the ML model's

the candidate classes, the confidence is typically taken to be $\max_i f(x)_i$.
This approach is potentially limited, as it disregards the rest of the
probability vector. In this work, we derive several confidence measures that
depend on information beyond the maximum score, such as margin-based and
entropy-based measures, and empirically evaluate their usefulness, focusing on
NLP tasks with distribution shifts and Transformer-based models. We show that
when models are evaluated on the out-of-distribution data ``out of the box'',
using only the maximum score to inform the confidence measure is highly
suboptimal. In the post-processing regime (where the scores of $f$ can be
improved using additional in-distribution held-out data), this remains true,
albeit less significant. Overall, our results suggest that entropy-based
confidence is a surprisingly useful measure.

groups' $I^\bullet(Y,\pi;R)$ for a rational homology 3-sphere $Y$, a set of
auxiliary data $\pi$, and a PID $R$. These objects are modules over the
cohomology ring $H^{-*}(BSO_3;R)$.
  We prove that the equivariant instanton homology groups $I^\bullet(Y;R)$ are
independent of the auxiliary data $\pi$, and thus define topological invariants
of rational homology spheres. Further, we prove that these invariants are
functorial under cobordisms of 3-manifolds with a path between the boundary
components.
  For any rational homology sphere $Y$, we may also define an analogue of
Floer's irreducible instanton homology group of integer homology spheres
$I_*(Y, \pi; R)$ which now depends on the auxiliary data $\pi$, unlike the
equivariant instanton homology groups. However, our methods allow us to prove a
precise ""wall-crossing formula'' for $I_*(Y, \pi; R)$ as the auxiliary data
$\pi$ moves between adjacent chambers. We use this to define an instanton
invariant $\lambda_I(Y) \in \Bbb Q$ of rational homology spheres, conjecturally
equal to the Casson-Walker invariant.
  Our approach to invariance uses a novel technique known as a suspended flow
category. Given an obstructed cobordism $W: Y \to Y'$, which supports reducible
instantons which can neither be cut out transversely nor be removed by a small
change to the perturbation, we remove and replace a neighborhood of obstructed
solutions in the moduli space of instantons. The resulting moduli spaces have a
new type of boundary component, so do not define a chain map between the
instanton chain complexes of $Y$ and $Y'$. However, it does define a chain map

scheme can be used in conjunction with an arbitrary high order spatial
discretization scheme such as 5th order WENO scheme. It can be shown that the
strongly S-stable DIRK3 scheme is not SSP and may introduce strong oscillations
under large time step. To overcome the oscillatory nature of DIRK3, the key
idea of L-DIRK3 scheme is to apply local time-limiters (K.Duraisamy,
J.D.Baeder, J-G Liu), with which the order of accuracy in time is locally
dropped to first order in the regions where the evolution of solution is not
smooth. In this way, the monotonicity condition is locally satisfied, while a
high order of accuracy is still maintained in most of the solution domain. For
convenience of applications to systems of equations, we propose a new and
simple construction of time-limiters which allows flexible choice of reference
quantity with minimal computation cost. Another key aspect of our work is to
extend the application of time-limiter schemes to multidimensional problems and
convection-diffusion equations. Numerical experiments for scalar/systems of
equations in one- and two-dimensions confirm the high resolution and the
improved stability of L-DIRK3 under large time steps. Moreover, the results
indicate the potential of time-limiter schemes to serve as a generic and

network - the giant component, but not considering the attack on a micro
perspective, which is the analysis of the node removals, during an attack,
themselves, their characteristics and results. In this paper we present and
apply the last method of focusing on the micro scale of an attack. Based on the
theory of percolation in networks, we analyze the phenomenon of an avalanche
results due to a single node removal from a network, that is a state in which a
removal of one node belongs to the network's giant component causes other nodes
to be also disconnected from it, which is a much greater contribution to the
fragmentation (immunization) of the network than only the single original node
removal itself. Specifically, we focus ourselves on the parameter of the size
of an avalanche, which is the number of nodes that are disconnected from the
giant component due to a single node removal. Relating to a random attack on a
network of the type of Cayley tree, we derive analytically the distribution of
the sizes of avalanches occur during the entire attack on it, until the network
is dismantled (immunized) and the attack is terminated.

2D$-$TLA, enriched the range of materials which can present such properties. In

have been utilized to reveal the true magnetic nature and ground state of

base$-$temperature is not, as previously suggested, helical, but rather
collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) with ferromagnetic (FM) spin coupling within
the $ab-$plane and AFM coupling along the $c-$axis. The ordered magnetic Cr
moment is established as $\mu_{\rm Cr}=$ 2.36 $\mu_{\rm B}$. From detailed
$\mu^+$SR measurements we observe an AFM ordering temperature $T_{\rm
N}\approx$ 125 K. This value is remarkably higher than the one previously
reported by magnetic bulk measurements. From $\mu^+$SR we are able to extract
the magnetic order parameter, whose critical exponent allows us to categorize
LiCrTe$_2$ in the 3D Heisenberg AFM universality class. Finally, by combining
our magnetic studies with high$-$resolution synchrotron X$-$ray diffraction
(XRD), we find a clear coupling between the nuclear and magnetic spin lattices.
This suggests the possibility for a strong magnon$-$phonon coupling, similar to
what has been previously observed in the closely related compound LiCrO$_2$.

  in Networks",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.SI stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimates of individual treatment effects from networked observational data
are attracting increasing attention these days. One major challenge in network
scenarios is the violation of the stable unit treatment value assumption
(SUTVA), which assumes that the treatment assignment of a unit does not
influence others' outcomes. In network data, due to interference, the outcome
of a unit is influenced not only by its treatment (i.e., direct effects) but
also by others' treatments (i.e., spillover effects). Furthermore, the
influences from other units are always heterogeneous (e.g., friends with
similar interests affect a person differently than friends with different
interests). In this paper, we focus on the problem of estimating individual
treatment effects (both direct and spillover effects) under heterogeneous
interference. To address this issue, we propose a novel Dual Weighting
Regression (DWR) algorithm by simultaneously learning attention weights that
capture the heterogeneous interference and sample weights to eliminate the
complex confounding bias in networks. We formulate the entire learning process
as a bi-level optimization problem. In theory, we present generalization error
bounds for individual treatment effect estimation. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DWR algorithm outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for estimating individual treatment effects under
heterogeneous interference.

throughout the past few years as promising lead-free alternatives for
optoelectronic applications. Yet, the atomic-scale mechanisms that underlie
their optical properties remain elusive. In this work, a throughout
investigation of the excitonic properties of key members within the VODP family
is presented. We employ ab-initio calculations and unveil critical details
regarding the role of electron-hole interactions in the electronic and optical
properties of VODP. The materials family is sampled based on the electronic
configuration of the tetravalent metal at the center of the octahedron. Hence,
groups with a valence comprised of s, p and d closed-shells are represented by
the known materials Cs$_{2}$SnX$_{6}$, Cs$_{2}$TeX$_{6}$ and Cs$_{2}$ZrX$_{6}$
(with X=Br, I), respectively. The electronic structure is investigated within
the G$_{0}$W$_{0}$ method, while the Bethe-Salpeter equation is solved to
account for electron-hole interactions that play a crucial role in the optical
properties of the family. A detailed symmetry analysis unravels the fine
structure of excitons for all compounds. The exciton binding energy, excitonic
wavefunctions and the dark-bright splitting are also reported for each
material. It is shown that these quantities can be tuned over a wide range,
form Wannier to Frenkel-type excitons, through for example substitutional
engineering. In particular, Te-based materials, which share the electronic
valency of corner-sharing Pb halide perovskites, are predicted to have exciton
binding energies of above 1 eV and a dark-bright splitting of the excitons
reaching over 100 meV. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the
optical properties of the entire family of VODP materials and highlight how
these are not in fact suitable Pb-free alternatives to traditional halide
perovskites.

chromospheric radiative energy losses. We aim to determine oscillation
properties of fibrils not only in the plane-of-the-sky (horizontal) direction,
but also along the line-of-sight (vertical) direction. We obtained
imaging-spectroscopy data in Fe I 6173, Ca II 8542, and Ca II K obtained with
the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. We created a sample of 120 bright Ca II K
fibrils and measured their horizontal motions. Their vertical motion was
determined through non-LTE inversion of the observed spectra. We determined the
periods and velocity amplitudes of the fibril oscillations, as well as phase
differences between vertical and horizontal oscillations in the fibrils. The
bright Ca II K fibrils carry transverse waves with a mean period of
$2.2\times10^2$ s, and a horizontal velocity amplitude of 2 km s$^{-1}$,
consistent with earlier results. The mean vertical velocity amplitude is 1 km
s$^{-1}$. We find that 118 out of the 120 fibrils carry waves in both the
vertical and horizontal directions, and 55 of those have identical periods. For
those 55, we find that all phase differences between $0$ and $2\pi$ occur, with
a mild but significant preference for linearly polarized waves (phase
difference of $0$ or $\pi$). The results are consistent with the scenario where
transverse waves are excited by granular buffeting at the photospheric
footpoints of the fibrils. Estimates of transverse wave flux based on imaging
data only are too low because they ignore the contribution of the vertical
velocity.

control of the spectral characteristics and polarization states of light.
Typically, these systems require the cascading of multiple filters,
polarization optics and rotating components to manipulate light, inevitably
increasing their sizes and complexities. Here, we report two-terminal
mid-infrared (mid-IR) emitters with electrically controllable spectral and
polarization properties. Our devices are composed of two back-to-back p-n
junctions formed by stacking anisotropic light-emitting materials, black
phosphorus and black arsenic-phosphorus with MoS2. By controlling the
crystallographic orientations and engineering the band profile of
heterostructures, the emissions of two junctions exhibit distinct spectral
ranges and polarization directions; more importantly, these two
electroluminescence (EL) units can be independently activated, depending on the
polarity of the applied bias. Furthermore, we show that when operating our
emitter under the polarity-switched pulse mode, its EL exhibits the
characteristics of broad spectral coverage, encompassing the entire first
mid-IR atmospheric window, and electrically tunable spectral shapes. Our
results provide the basis for developing groundbreaking technology in the field
of light emitters.

into a nanoscale gap. These optical hotspots are highly attractive for boosting
nonlinear processes, such as harmonic generation, photoelectron emission, and
ultrafast electron transport. Alongside large field enhancement, such phenomena
often require control over the field asymmetry in the hotspot, which is
challenging considering the nanometer length scales. Here, by means of strongly
enhanced second harmonic generation, we demonstrate unprecedented control over
the field distribution in a hotspot by systematically introducing geometrical
asymmetry to the antenna gap. We use focused helium ion beam milling of
mono-crystalline gold to realize asymmetric-gap dimer antennas in which an
ultra-sharp tip with 3 nm apex radius faces a flat counterpart, conserving the
bonding antenna mode and the concomitant field enhancement at the fundamental
frequency. By decreasing the tip opening angle, we are able to systematically
increase both field enhancement and asymmetry, thus enhancing second harmonic
radiation to the far-field, which is nearly completely suppressed for
equivalent symmetric dimer antennas. Combining these findings with second
harmonic radiation patterns as well as quantitative nonlinear simulations, we
further obtain remarkably detailed insights into the mechanism of second
harmonic generation at the nanoscale. Our results open new opportunities for
the realization of novel nonlinear nanoscale systems, where the control over
local field asymmetry in combination with large field enhancement is essential
to create nonreciprocal functionalities.

strain waves in a bi-layer with a soft bonding between the layers (e.g. a soft
adhesive). From the mathematical viewpoint, a particularly difficult case
appears when the linear long-wave speeds in the layers are significantly
different (high-contrast case). The traditional derivation of the
uni-directional models leads to four uncoupled Ostrovsky equations, for the
right- and left-propagating waves in each layer. However, the models impose a
``zero-mass constraint'' i.e. the initial conditions should necessarily have
zero mean, restricting the applicability of that description. Here, we bypass
the contradiction in this high-contrast case by constructing the solution for
the deviation from the evolving mean value, using asymptotic multiple-scale
expansions involving two pairs of fast characteristic variables and two
slow-time variables. By construction, the Ostrovsky equations emerging within
the scope of this derivation are solved for initial conditions with zero mean
while initial conditions for the original system may have non-zero mean values.
Asymptotic validity of the solution is carefully examined numerically. We apply
the models to the description of counter-propagating waves generated by
solitary wave initial conditions, or co-propagating waves generated by cnoidal
wave initial conditions, as well as the resulting wave interactions, and
contrast with the behaviour of the waves in bi-layers when the linear long-wave
speeds in the layers are close (low-contrast case). One local (classical) and
two non-local (generalised) conservation laws of the coupled Boussinesq
equations for strains are derived, and these are used to control the accuracy

ring width, as spurious effects such as cavity-like localization and
higher-order mode coupling occur, making the modal resonance splitting
unpredictable. By carefully considering the impact of polarization and the role
of the total modulated effective refractive index, we present a predictable and
accurate design approach to achieve an arbitrary modal splitting envelope

this advance in dispersion engineering, we discuss through simulation the

redesigned to take into account sensing echo signals. Then, the transmit
beamforming design of both transceivers is proposed for addressing the sensing

on machine learning over the user's WiFi network activity. It first employs a
semi-personalized random forest model with an infinitesimal jackknife variance
estimation method to classify a user's network activity behavior into sleep and
awake states per minute granularity. Through a moving average technique, the
system uses these state sequences to estimate the user's nocturnal sleep period

overcome the impact of noisy WiFi data that can yield large prediction errors.

college campus, we evaluate SleepMore on non-student users of different housing
profiles. Our results demonstrate that SleepMore produces statistically
indistinguishable sleep statistics from the Oura ring baseline for predictions
made within a 5% uncertainty rate. These errors range between 15-28 minutes for
determining sleep time and 7-29 minutes for determining wake time, proving
statistically significant improvements over prior work. Our in-depth analysis
explains the sources of errors.

decision boundaries on feature spaces so that clients with not independently
and identically distributed (non-iid) data can learn about scarce labels. In
addition, local feature representation learning is applied to stabilize the
decision boundaries and improve the local feature extraction capabilities for
clients. While the existing methods require the collection of auxiliary data or
model weights to generate a counterpart, FedClassAvg only requires clients to
communicate with a couple of fully connected layers, which is highly
communication-efficient. Moreover, FedClassAvg does not require extra
optimization problems such as knowledge transfer, which requires intensive
computation overhead. We evaluated FedClassAvg through extensive experiments
and demonstrated it outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithms on
heterogeneous personalized federated learning tasks.

common paradigms of metallicity initial conditions in simulations: ignoring the
metallicity initial condition and assuming a uniform metallicity floor. We find
that ignoring metallicity requirements for enriched star formation results in a
redshift-dependent excess in stellar mass created and compounding errors
consisting of stars forming in pristine gas. We find that using a metallicity
floor causes an early underproduction of stars before $z=21$ that reverses to
overproduction by $z=18$. At the final redshift, $z=14.95$, there is $\sim
20\%$ excess stellar mass with 8.6\% increased protogalaxy count. Heterogeneous
metallicity initial conditions greatly increase the range of halo observables,
e.g., stellar metallicity, stellar mass, and luminosity. The increased range
leads to better agreement with observations of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies when
compared to metallicity-floor simulations. \starnet generates protogalaxies
with low stellar mass, $M_* \lesssim 10^3 M_\odot$, so may also serve to model
low-luminosity protogalaxies more effectively than a metallicity floor

what are, to the best of our knowledge, the first steganography algorithms to

these algorithms are highly scalable. To provide empirical validation, we
compare a minimum entropy coupling-based approach to three modern baselines --

assume, without justification, that unvaccinated persons hospitalized during

possible further exaggeration of myocarditis risk post infection by a factor of

respect to guiding public health recommendations. For instance, an
insignificant number of cases contributing to the study's findings were

considering the hierarchical structural information between samples. To address
this limitation, this paper proposes a new SAE model-neighbouring envelope
embedded stack autoencoder ensemble (NE_ESAE). Firstly, the neighbouring sample
envelope learning mechanism (NSELM) is proposed for preprocessing of input of
SAE. NSELM constructs sample pairs by combining neighbouring samples. Besides,
the NSELM constructs a multilayer sample spaces by multilayer iterative mean
clustering, which considers the similar samples and generates layers of
envelope samples with hierarchical structural information. Second, an embedded
stack autoencoder (ESAE) is proposed and trained in each layer of sample space
to consider the original samples during training and in the network structure,
thereby better finding the relationship between original feature samples and
deep feature samples. Third, feature reduction and base classifiers are
conducted on the layers of envelope samples respectively, and output
classification results of every layer of samples. Finally, the classification
results of the layers of envelope sample space are fused through the ensemble
mechanism. In the experimental section, the proposed algorithm is validated
with over ten representative public datasets. The results show that our method
significantly has better performance than existing traditional feature learning
methods and the representative deep autoencoders.

cold dark matter (CDM) becomes increasingly persuasive. A particularly
appealing version of CDM is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) with a
mass near the electroweak scale, which can naturally have the observed relic
abundance after annihilation in the early universe. But in order for a WIMP to
be consistent with the currently stringent experimental constraints it must
have relatively small cross-sections for indirect, direct, and collider
detection. Using our calculations and estimates of these cross-sections, we
discuss the potential for discovery of a recently proposed dark matter WIMP
which has a mass of about 70 GeV/c$^2$ and only second-order couplings to W and
Z bosons. There is evidence that indirect detection may already have been
achieved, since analyses of the gamma rays detected by Fermi-LAT and the
antiprotons observed by AMS-02 are consistent with 70 GeV dark matter having
our calculated $\langle \sigma_{ann} v \rangle \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-26} $
cm$^3$/s. The estimated sensitivities for LZ and XENONnT indicate that these
experiments may achieve direct detection within the next few years, since we
estimate the relevant cross-section to be slightly above $10^{-48}$ cm$^2$.
Other experiments such as PandaX, SuperCDMS, and especially DARWIN should be
able to confirm on a longer time scale. The high-luminosity LHC might achieve
collider detection within about 15 years, since we estimate a collider
cross-section slightly below 1 femtobarn. Definitive confirmation should come
from still more powerful planned collider experiments (such as a future
circular collider) within 15-35 years.

samples of these networks. One of the main challenges of privacy for users in
these networks is anomalies in security. Anomalies in online social networks
can be attributed to illegal behavior, such deviance is done by malicious
people like account forgers, online fraudsters, etc. This paper proposed a new
method to identify fake user accounts by calculating the similarity measures

  Application to the Flutter Margin Method",,,,,"cs.CE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Zimmerman and Weissenburger's flutter margin method is widely used to
estimate the aeroelastic coalescence flutter speed. In contrast to aeroelastic
decay rates, the flutter margin exhibits monotonic decay with respect to
airspeed redering it effective in extrapolating the flutter speed using flight
test data conducted at pre-flutter airspeeds. This paper reports the
generalization of the Bayesian formulation of the flutter margin method by
Khalil et al. developed to tackle measurement and modeling uncertainties. This
paper improves the predictive performance of the previous algorithm by
incorporating the joint prior of aeroelastic modal frequencies and decay rates
among airspeeds in order to better estimate the joint posterior of modal
parameters using observational data. The modal parameter prior is constructed
using the classical two-degree-of-freedom pitch-plunge aeroelastic model whose
system matrices (e.g. structural stiffness and damping matrices) vary randomly.
Such joint modal parameter prior enforces statistical dependence among
posteriors of modal parameters and the associated flutter margins across
airspeeds. Numerical studies demonstrate a considerable reduction of
uncertainties on the predicted flutter speed obtained from the generalized
Bayesian flutter margin method. This improved algorithm can cut cost by
reducing the number of flight tests and better assess the uncertainty against
aeroelastic flutter.

topic in the field of Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer

there has been a fundamental shift in the trend of MI-EEG classifiers,
resulting in a gradual increase in their performance. The emergence of
Tensor-CSPNet, the first geometric deep learning (GDL) framework in BCI
research, is attributed to the imperative of characterizing the non-Euclidean
nature of signals. Fundamentally, Tensor-CSPNet is a deep learning-based
classifier that capitalizes on the second-order statistics of EEGs. In contrast
to the conventional approach of utilizing first-order statistics for EEG
signals, the utilization of these second-order statistics represents the
classical treatment. These statistics provide adequate discriminative
information, rendering them suitable for MI-EEG classification. In this study,
we introduce another GDL classifier, called Graph-CSPNet, for MI-EEG
classification. Graph-CSPNet utilizes graph-based techniques to characterize
EEG signals in both the time and frequency domains, realizing the fundamental
perspective of time-frequency analysis. The architecture of Graph-CSPNet is
further simplified, offering greater flexibility to cope with variable
time-frequency resolution for signal segmentation and capturing localized
fluctuations. In contrast to Tensor-CSPNet, this approach enables Graph-CSPNet
to achieve better results in MI-EEG classification. To evaluate the efficacy of
Graph-CSPNet, we utilize five commonly-used publicly available MI-EEG datasets,

eleven subject-specific scenarios. The Python implementation of Graph-CSPNet is

reactive agent for the in-situ degradation of groundwater contaminants. While
the performance of these ENPs has been highly promising on the laboratory
scale, their application in real field case conditions is still limited. The
complex transport and retention mechanisms of ENPs hinder the development of an
efficient remediation strategy. Therefore, a predictive tool for understanding
the transport and retention behavior of ENPs is highly required. The existing
tools in the literature are dominated with numerical simulators, which have
limited flexibility and accuracy in the presence of sparse datasets. This work
uses a dynamic, weight-enabled Physics-Informed Neural Network (dw-PINN)
framework to model the nano-particle behavior within an aquifer. The result
from the forward model demonstrates the effective capability of dw-PINN in
accurately predicting the ENPs mobility. The model verification step shows that
the relative mean square error (MSE) of the predicted ENPs concentration using
dw-PINN converges to a minimum value of $1.3{e^{-5}}$. In the subsequent step,
the result from the inverse model estimates the governing parameters of ENPs
mobility with reasonable accuracy. The research demonstrates the tool's

  September 2022, Padua, Italy",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The development of bilingual dictionaries to medieval translations presents
diverse difficulties. These result from two types of philological
circumstances: a) the asymmetry between the source language and the target
language; and b) the varying available sources of both the original and
translated texts. In particular, the full critical edition of Tihova of
Constantine of Preslav's Uchitel'noe evangelie ('Didactic Gospel') gives a
relatively good idea of the Old Church Slavonic translation but not of its
Greek source text. This is due to the fact that Cramer's edition of the catenae
- used as the parallel text in it - is based on several codices whose text does
not fully coincide with the Slavonic. This leads to the addition of the
newly-discovered parallels from Byzantine manuscripts and John Chrysostom's
homilies. Our approach to these issues is a step-wise process with two main
goals: a) to facilitate the philological annotation of input data and b) to
consider the manifestations of the mentioned challenges, first, separately in
order to simplify their resolution, and, then, in their combination. We
demonstrate how we model various types of asymmetric translation correlates and
the variability resulting from the pluralism of sources. We also demonstrate
how all these constructions are being modelled and processed into the final
indices. Our approach is designed with generalisation in mind and is intended
to be applicable also for other translations from Greek into Old Church
Slavonic.

  Scheme For Two-Dimensional Sobolev and Regularized Long Wave Equations
  Arising In Fluid Mechanics","20 pages, 3 tables, 12 figures",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  This paper develops a robust three-level time split high-order
Leapfrog/Crank-Nicolson technique for solving the two-dimensional unsteady
sobolev and regularized long wave equations arising in fluid mechanics. A deep
analysis of the stability and error estimates of the proposed approach is
considered using the $L^{\infty}(0,T;H^{2})$-norm. Under a suitable time step
requirement, the theoretical studies indicate that the constructed numerical
scheme is strongly stable (in the sense of $L^{\infty}(0,T;H^{2})$-norm),
temporal second-order accurate and convergence of order $O(h^{\frac{8}{3}})$ in
space, where $h$ denotes the grid step. This result suggests that the proposed
algorithm is less time consuming, fast and more efficient than a broad range of
numerical methods widely discussed in the literature for the considered
problem. Numerical experiments confirm the theory and demonstrate the
efficiency and utility of the three-level time split high-order formulation.

  Clinical Note Language Modeling",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Large pre-trained language models (LMs) have been widely adopted in
biomedical and clinical domains, introducing many powerful LMs such as bio-lm
and BioELECTRA. However, the applicability of these methods to real clinical
use cases is hindered, due to the limitation of pre-trained LMs in processing
long textual data with thousands of words, which is a common length for a
clinical note. In this work, we explore long-range adaptation from such LMs
with Longformer, allowing the LMs to capture longer clinical notes context. We
conduct experiments on three n2c2 challenges datasets and a longitudinal
clinical dataset from Hong Kong Hospital Authority electronic health record
(EHR) system to show the effectiveness and generalizability of this concept,
achieving 10\% F1-score improvement. Based on our experiments, we conclude that
capturing a longer clinical note interval is beneficial to the model
performance, but there are different cut-off intervals to achieve the optimal
performance for different target variables. Our code is available at

  anti-derivative functions","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2201.08199",,,,"math.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The class of surreal numbers, denoted by $\textbf{No}$, initially proposed by
Conway, is a universal ordered field in the sense that any ordered field can be
embedded in it. They include in particular the real numbers and the ordinal
numbers. They have strong relations with other fields such as field of
transseries. Following Gonshor, surreal numbers can be seen as signs sequences
of ordinal length, with some exponential and logarithmic functions that extend
the usual functions over the reals. $\textbf{No}$ can actually be seen as an
elegant (generalized) power series field with real coefficients, namely Hahn
series with exponents in $\textbf{No}$ itself.
  Some years ago, Berarducci and Mantova considered derivation over the surreal
numbers, seeing them as germs of functions, in correspondence to transseries.
In this article, following our previous work, we exhibit a sufficient condition
on the structure of a surreal field to be stable under all operations among
exponential, logarithm, derivation and anti-derivation. Motivated, in the long
term, by computability considerations, we also provide a non-trivial
application of this theorem: the existence of a pretty reasonable field that
only requires ordinals up to $\epsilon_\omega$, which is far smaller than
$\omega_1^{CK}$ (resp. $\omega_1$), the first non-computable (resp.
uncountable) ordinal.

  Verification in a Complex Scattering System",,,,,"nlin.AO nlin.CD","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Electromagnetic (EM) wave scattering in electrically large, irregularly
shaped, environments is a common phenomenon. The deterministic, or first
principles, study of this process is usually computationally expensive and the
results exhibit extreme sensitivity to scattering details. For this reason, the
deterministic approach is often dropped in favor of a statistical one. The
Random Coupling Model (RCM) is one such approach that has found great success
in providing a statistical characterization for wave chaotic systems in the
frequency domain. Here we aim to transform the RCM into the time domain and
generalize it to new situations. The proposed time-domain RCM (TD-RCM) method
can treat a wave chaotic system with multiple ports and modes. Two features are
now possible with the time-domain approach for chaotic resonators: the
incorporation of earlytime short-orbit transmission path effects between the
ports, and the inclusion of arbitrary nonlinear or time-varying port load
impedances. We have conducted short-pulse time-domain experiments in wave
chaotic enclosures, and used the TD-RCM to simulate the corresponding
experimental setup. We have also examined a diode-loaded port and compared
experimental results with a numerical TD-RCM treatment and found agreement.

methods in next-generation networks (NextG), AI algorithms have provided
significant advantages for NextG in terms of frequency spectrum usage,

AI, i.e., self-learning architecture based on self-supervised algorithms, to
improve the performance of the network. A secure AI-powered structure is also
expected to protect NextG networks against cyber-attacks. However, AI itself
may be attacked, i.e., model poisoning targeted by attackers, and it results in
cybersecurity violations. This paper proposes an AI trust platform using
Streamlit for NextG networks that allows researchers to evaluate, defend,
certify, and verify their AI models and applications against adversarial
threats of evasion, poisoning, extraction, and interference.

  Machine Learning",,,,"physics.geo-ph cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Geological carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), where CO$_2$ is stored in
subsurface formations, is a promising and scalable approach for reducing global
emissions. However, if done incorrectly, it may lead to earthquakes and leakage
of CO$_2$ back to the surface, harming both humans and the environment. These
risks are exacerbated by the large amount of uncertainty in the structure of
the storage formation. For these reasons, we propose that CCS operations be
modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and decisions
be informed using automated planning algorithms. To this end, we develop a
simplified model of CCS operations based on a 2D spillpoint analysis that
retains many of the challenges and safety considerations of the real-world
problem. We show how off-the-shelf POMDP solvers outperform expert baselines
for safe CCS planning. This POMDP model can be used as a test bed to drive the
development of novel decision-making algorithms for CCS operations.

Jacobian information from an approximate prior model of the system, and
improved tracking performance over traditional model-based MPC. We demonstrate
JDMD's ability to quickly learn bilinear Koopman dynamics representations
across several realistic examples in simulation, including a perching maneuver
for a fixed-wing aircraft with an empirically derived high-fidelity physics
model. In all cases, we show that the models learned by JDMD provide superior
tracking and generalization performance within a model-predictive control
framework, even in the presence of significant model mismatch, when compared to
approximate prior models and models learned by standard Extended DMD (EDMD).

triangular correlation for a multi-block material configuration that consist of
concrete, stainless steel, and uranium. By changing the order of this material
set, we employ the GEANT4 simulations and we show that the triangular
correlation is valid in the multi-block material setups, thereby providing the
