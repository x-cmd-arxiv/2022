learning of visual representations. Our framework is a minimal and conceptually
clean synthesis of (C) contrastive learning, (A) masked autoencoders, and (N)
the noise prediction approach used in diffusion models. The learning mechanisms
are complementary to one another: contrastive learning shapes the embedding
space across a batch of image samples; masked autoencoders focus on
reconstruction of the low-frequency spatial correlations in a single image
sample; and noise prediction encourages the reconstruction of the
high-frequency components of an image. The combined approach results in a
robust, scalable and simple-to-implement algorithm. The training process is
symmetric, with 50% of patches in both views being masked at random, yielding a
considerable efficiency improvement over prior contrastive learning methods.
Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that CAN achieves strong downstream
performance under both linear and finetuning evaluations on transfer learning
and robustness tasks. CAN outperforms MAE and SimCLR when pre-training on
ImageNet, but is especially useful for pre-training on larger uncurated
datasets such as JFT-300M: for linear probe on ImageNet, CAN achieves 75.4%
compared to 73.4% for SimCLR and 64.1% for MAE. The finetuned performance on
ImageNet of our ViT-L model is 86.1%, compared to 85.5% for SimCLR, and 85.4%
for MAE. The overall FLOPs load of SimCLR is 70% higher than CAN for ViT-L
models.

diving into algorithm design, we first define, under mild structural

detailed microscopic features related to transient growth conditions and
solid-liquid interface stability (e.g. the initial planar growth stage prior to
its cellular/dendritic destabilization, or the early elimination of unfavorably
oriented grains due to neighbor grain sidebranching) can only be captured by PF
simulations. The resulting disagreement between PF and CA predictions can only
be addressed partially by a refinement of the CA grid. However, overall grain
distributions averaged over the entire melt pools of several simulations seem
to lead to a notably better agreement between PF and CA, with some variability
with the melt pool shape and CA grid. While further research remains required,
in particular to identify the appropriate selection of CA spatial
discretization and its link to characteristic microstructural length scales,
this research provides a useful step forward in this direction by comparing
both methods quantitatively at process-relevant length and time scales.

different regimes with different type of observed azimuthal structures. The
transition between the regimes is controlled by the mechanism of the energy
input to the discharge. In the first regime (low energy of the injected
electrons), with the pronounced $m=1$ spoke activity, the power input is
dominated by the energy absorption due to the radial current and
self-consistent electric field. In the other regime (higher energy of the
injected electrons), with prevalent small scale $m>1$ spiral structures, and
the lower values of the anomalous transport, the total energy deposited to the
discharge is lower and is mostly due to the direct input of the kinetic energy

and, if the plasma beta is sufficiently high, becomes unstable to the firehose
instability, in a process that we dub the synchrotron firehose instability
(SFHI). The SFHI channels free energy from the pressure anisotropy of the
radiating, relativistic electrons (and/or positrons) into small-amplitude,
kinetic-scale magnetic-field fluctuations, which pitch-angle scatter the
particles and bring the plasma to a near-thermal state of marginal instability.
The PIC simulations reveal a nonlinear cyclic evolution of firehose bursts
interspersed by periods of stable cooling. We compare the SFHI for
electron-positron and electron-ion plasmas. As a byproduct of the growing
electron-firehose magnetic field fluctuations, magnetized ions gain a pressure
anisotropy opposite to that of the electrons. If these ions are
relativistically hot, we find that they also experience cooling due to
collisionless thermal coupling with the electrons, which we argue is mediated
by a secondary ion-cyclotron instability. We suggest that the SFHI may be
activated in a number of astrophysical scenarios, such as within ejecta from
black-hole accretion flows and relativistic jets, where the redistribution of
energetic electrons from low to high pitch angles may cause transient bursts of
radiation.

potential to adapt a learning model across source and target domains with
mismatched distributions. Since DA methods rely exclusively on the given source
and target domain samples, they generally yield models that are vulnerable to
noise and unable to adapt to unseen samples from the target domain, which calls
for DA methods that guarantee the robustness and generalization of the learned
models. In this paper, we propose DRDA, a distributionally robust domain
adaptation method. DRDA leverages a distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
framework to learn a robust decision function that minimizes the worst-case
target domain risk and generalizes to any sample from the target domain by
transferring knowledge from a given labeled source domain sample. We utilize
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric to construct an ambiguity set of
distributions that provably contains the source and target domain distributions
with high probability. Hence, the risk is shown to upper bound the
out-of-sample target domain loss. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
formulation outperforms existing robust learning approaches.

several Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) approaches, specifically the U-Net
architecture, have been proposed. The U-Net model with a symmetrical
architecture has exhibited superior performance in the segmentation task.
However, the locality restriction of the convolutional operation incorporated
in the U-Net architecture limits its performance in capturing long-range
dependency, which is crucial for the segmentation task in medical images. To
address this limitation, recently a Transformer based U-Net architecture that
replaces the CNN blocks with the Swin Transformer module has been proposed to
capture both local and global representation. In this paper, we propose
Att-SwinU-Net, an attention-based Swin U-Net extension, for medical image
segmentation. In our design, we seek to enhance the feature re-usability of the

classical concatenation operation utilized in the skip connection path can be
further improved by incorporating an attention mechanism. By performing a
comprehensive ablation study on several skin lesion segmentation datasets, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attention mechanism.

could be developed to include common FOD examples, it is infeasible to collect
all possible FOD examples in the dataset representation because of the
open-ended nature of FOD. Limitations of the dataset could cause FOD detection
systems driven by those supervised algorithms to miss certain FOD, which can
become dangerous to airport operations. To this end, this paper presents a
self-supervised FOD localization by learning to predict the runway images,
which avoids the enumeration of FOD annotation examples. The localization
method utilizes the Vision Transformer (ViT) to improve localization
performance. The experiments show that the method successfully detects

extension to the localization result to perform classification; a feature that
can be useful to downstream tasks. To train the localization, this paper also

near-infrared wavelengths. Such studies, however, were either limited in narrow
filter imaging or sparsely sampled mid-infrared spectroscopic observations with
relatively poor angular resolutions. Here we present near-infrared ($H$- and
$K$-band) spectroscopic mosaic observations towards the A, B, C, and G regions

$\mathcal H \subseteq \mathcal O(\Omega)$ be an analytic Hilbert module, i.e.,
the Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ possesses a reproducing kernel $K$, the
polynomial ring $\mathbb C[\boldsymbol{z}]\subseteq \mathcal H$ is dense and
the point-wise multiplication induced by $p\in \mathbb C[\boldsymbol{z}]$ is
bounded on $\mathcal H$. We fix an ideal $\mathcal I \subseteq \mathbb
C[\boldsymbol{z}]$ generated by $p_1,\ldots,p_t$ and let $[\mathcal I]$ denote
the completion of $\mathcal I$ in $\mathcal H$. The sheaf $\mathcal S^\mathcal
H$ associated to analytic Hilbert module $\mathcal H$ is the sheaf $\mathcal
O(\Omega)$ of holomorphic functions on $\Omega$ and hence is free. However, the
subsheaf $\mathcal S^{\mathcal [\mathcal I]}$ associated to $[\mathcal I]$ is
coherent and not necessarily locally free. Building on the earlier work of
\cite{BMP}, we prescribe a hermitian structure for a coherent sheaf and use it
to find tractable invariants. Moreover, we prove that if the zero set
$V_{[\mathcal I]}$ is a submanifold of codimension $t$, then there is a unique
local decomposition for the kernel $K_{[\mathcal I]}$ along the zero set that
serves as a holomorphic frame for a vector bundle on $V_{[\mathcal I]}$. The
complex geometric invariants of this vector bundle are also unitary invariants
for the submodule $[\mathcal I] \subseteq \mathcal H$.

exploration in multi-armed bandits yet is less popular than the probability of
missing the best arm or an $\epsilon$-good arm, perhaps due to lack of easy
ways to characterize it. In this paper, we make significant progress on
minimizing simple regret in both data-rich ($T\ge n$) and data-poor regime ($T
\le n$) where $n$ is the number of arms, and $T$ is the number of samples. At
its heart is our improved instance-dependent analysis of the well-known
Sequential Halving (SH) algorithm, where we bound the probability of returning
an arm whose mean reward is not within $\epsilon$ from the best (i.e., not
$\epsilon$-good) for \textit{any} choice of $\epsilon>0$, although $\epsilon$
is not an input to SH. Our bound not only leads to an optimal worst-case simple
regret bound of $\sqrt{n/T}$ up to logarithmic factors but also essentially
matches the instance-dependent lower bound for returning an $\epsilon$-good arm
reported by Katz-Samuels and Jamieson (2020). For the more challenging
data-poor regime, we propose Bracketing SH (BSH) that enjoys the same
improvement even without sampling each arm at least once. Our empirical study
shows that BSH outperforms existing methods on real-world tasks.

classification network into an optical fully convolutional neural network with
high-resolution feature maps and kernels. When using the free-space 4f system
to accelerate the inference speed of neural networks, higher resolutions of
feature maps and kernels can be used without the loss in frame rate. We present
FatNet for the classification of images, which is more compatible with
free-space acceleration than standard convolutional classifiers. It neglects
the standard combination of convolutional feature extraction and classifier
dense layers by performing both in one fully convolutional network. This
approach takes full advantage of the parallelism in the 4f free-space system
and performs fewer conversions between electronics and optics by reducing the
number of channels and increasing the resolution, making the network faster in
optics than off-the-shelf networks. To demonstrate the capabilities of FatNet,
it trained with the CIFAR100 dataset on GPU and the simulator of the 4f system,
then compared the results against ResNet-18. The results show 8.2 times fewer
convolution operations at the cost of only 6% lower accuracy compared to the
original network. These are promising results for the approach of training deep

  Two-player Competitive Games",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent research on vulnerabilities of deep reinforcement learning (RL) has
shown that adversarial policies adopted by an adversary agent can influence a
target RL agent (victim agent) to perform poorly in a multi-agent environment.
In existing studies, adversarial policies are directly trained based on
experiences of interacting with the victim agent. There is a key shortcoming of
this approach; knowledge derived from historical interactions may not be
properly generalized to unexplored policy regions of the victim agent, making
the trained adversarial policy significantly less effective. In this work, we
design a new effective adversarial policy learning algorithm that overcomes
this shortcoming. The core idea of our new algorithm is to create a new
imitator to imitate the victim agent's policy while the adversarial policy will
be trained not only based on interactions with the victim agent but also based
on feedback from the imitator to forecast victim's intention. By doing so, we
can leverage the capability of imitation learning in well capturing underlying
characteristics of the victim policy only based on sample trajectories of the
victim. Our victim imitation learning model differs from prior models as the
environment's dynamics are driven by adversary's policy and will keep changing
during the adversarial policy training. We provide a provable bound to
guarantee a desired imitating policy when the adversary's policy becomes
stable. We further strengthen our adversarial policy learning by making our
imitator a stronger version of the victim. Finally, our extensive experiments
using four competitive MuJoCo game environments show that our proposed
adversarial policy learning algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.

therefore, it is important to investigate the associations among developmental
processes and understand their joint development. The latent growth curve model
(LGCM) with a time-varying covariate (TVC) provides a method to estimate the
TVC's effect on a longitudinal outcome while simultaneously modeling the
outcome's change. However, it does not allow the TVC to predict variations in
the random growth coefficients. We propose decomposing the TVC's effect into
initial trait and temporal states using three methods to address this
limitation. In each method, the baseline of the TVC is viewed as an initial
trait, and the corresponding effects are obtained by regressing random
intercepts and slopes on the baseline value. Temporal states are characterized
as (1) interval-specific slopes, (2) interval-specific changes, or (3) changes
from the baseline at each measurement occasion, depending on the method. We
demonstrate our methods through simulations and real-world data analyses,
assuming a linear-linear functional form for the longitudinal outcome. The
results demonstrate that LGCMs with a decomposed TVC can provide unbiased and
precise estimates with target confidence intervals. We also provide OpenMx and
Mplus 8 code for these methods with commonly used linear and nonlinear

Unfortunately, however, the most popular federated learning algorithms have

which can modify models (here, deep neural network) during training by
identifying dissimilarities between neurons among the clients. This permits to
account for clients' specificity without impairing generalization. FedDist
evaluated with three state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms on three

shown the ability of FedDist to adapt to heterogeneous data and the capability

proposal to test the quantum nature of gravity by creating quantum

nature of gravity can entangle the two quantum systems, but still sufficiently
far away that all other known Standard Model interactions remain negligible.
However, the mere process of preparing superposition states of a neutral mass

quantum system; since gravity is universal, the lighter system can get
entangled with the heavier system, providing an inherent source of
gravitational decoherence. In this paper, we will consider two light and two
heavy quantum oscillators, forming pairs of probe-detector systems, and study
under what conditions the entanglement between two light systems evades the
decoherence induced by the heavy systems. We conclude by estimating the
magnitude of the decoherence in the proposed experiment for testing the quantum

relations for bounded operators on Banach spaces. It has been known for 30
years that the former implies the latter, but only recently Ter Horst,
Messerschmidt, Ran and Roelands disproved the converse by constructing a pair
of Fredholm operators which are EAE, but not SC.
  Motivated by this result, we investigate when EAE and SC coincide for
Fred\-holm operators. Fredholm operators which are EAE have the same Fredholm
index. Surprisingly, we find that for each integer $k$ and every pair of Banach
spaces $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})$, either no pair of Fredholm operators of
index~$k$ acting on $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$, respectively, is SC, or
every pair of this kind which is EAE is also SC. Consequently, the question
whether EAE and SC coincide for Fredholm operators of index~$k$ depends only on
the geometry of the underlying Banach spaces $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$,
not on the properties of the operators themselves.
  We quantify this finding by introducing two numerical indices which capture
the coincidence of EAE and SC, and provide a number of examples illustrating
the possible values of these indices. Notably, this includes an example showing
that the above-mentioned result of Ter Horst et al, which is based on a pair of
essentially incomparable Banach spaces, does not extend to projectively
incomparable Banach spaces.

who have to navigate to a desired goal under different conditions of urgency
and safety preferences. While automatic modelling of pedestrian attention holds
great promise to improve simulations of pedestrian behavior, current saliency
prediction approaches mostly focus on generic free-viewing scenarios and do not
reflect the specific challenges present in pedestrian attention prediction. In
this paper, we present Context-SalNET, a novel encoder-decoder architecture
that explicitly addresses three key challenges of visual attention prediction
in pedestrians: First, Context-SalNET explicitly models the context factors
urgency and safety preference in the latent space of the encoder-decoder model.
Second, we propose the exponentially weighted mean squared error loss (ew-MSE)
that is able to better cope with the fact that only a small part of the ground
truth saliency maps consist of non-zero entries. Third, we explicitly model
epistemic uncertainty to account for the fact that training data for pedestrian
attention prediction is limited. To evaluate Context-SalNET, we recorded the
first dataset of pedestrian visual attention in VR that includes explicit
variation of the context factors urgency and safety preference. Context-SalNET
achieves clear improvements over state-of-the-art saliency prediction
approaches as well as over ablations. Our novel dataset will be made fully
available and can serve as a valuable resource for further research on
pedestrian attention prediction.

benchmarks chosen to be particularly primal-difficult, our approach leads to
faster solving and smaller branch- and-bound trees than the default ranking

configuration time that scale with $\log_2 N$ for balanced trees versus $N$ in
unbalanced trees, despite the same number of total components. Specifically, we
use second-order perturbation theory to compute phase sensitivity in each
waveguide of balanced and unbalanced networks, and we compute the statistics of
the sensitivity given random input vectors. We also evaluate such networks
after they self-correct, or self-configure, themselves for errors in the

important implications for scaling photonic circuits to much larger circuit

The simulation results show that, over a wide range of activity values, the

capture cross-lingual word similarities; such CLWEs are obtained 1) via
traditional static models (e.g., VecMap), or 2) by extracting type-level CLWEs
from multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs), or 3) through combining
the former two options. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised
post-hoc reranking method termed BLICEr (BLI with Cross-Encoder Reranking),
applicable to any precalculated CLWE space, which improves their BLI
capability. The key idea is to 'extract' cross-lingual lexical knowledge from
mPLMs, and then combine it with the original CLWEs. This crucial step is done
via 1) creating a word similarity dataset, comprising positive word pairs
(i.e., true translations) and hard negative pairs induced from the original
CLWE space, and then 2) fine-tuning an mPLM (e.g., mBERT or XLM-R) in a
cross-encoder manner to predict the similarity scores. At inference, we 3)
combine the similarity score from the original CLWE space with the score from
the BLI-tuned cross-encoder. BLICEr establishes new state-of-the-art results on
two standard BLI benchmarks spanning a wide spectrum of diverse languages: it
substantially outperforms a series of strong baselines across the board. We

Few-shot learning, and meta-learning in general, aim to overcome these issues

surrogate loss, confidence calibration, and principled ensembling of experts.
Firstly, we derive two consistent surrogates -- one based on a softmax
parameterization, the other on a one-vs-all (OvA) parameterization -- that are
analogous to the single expert losses proposed by Mozannar and Sontag (2020)
and Verma and Nalisnick (2022), respectively. We then study the frameworks'
ability to estimate P( m_j = y | x ), the probability that the jth expert will
correctly predict the label for x. Theory shows the softmax-based loss causes
mis-calibration to propagate between the estimates while the OvA-based loss
does not (though in practice, we find there are trade offs). Lastly, we propose
a conformal inference technique that chooses a subset of experts to query when
the system defers. We perform empirical validation on tasks for galaxy, skin
lesion, and hate speech classification.

(VIN-RS), a potential-based reward shaping mechanism using Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN). The proposed VIN-RS embeds a CNN trained on computed labels
using the message passing mechanism of the Hidden Markov Model. The CNN
processes images or graphs of the environment to predict the shaping values.
Recent work on reward shaping still has limitations towards training on a
representation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) and building an estimate of
the transition matrix. The advantage of VIN-RS is to construct an effective
potential function from an estimated MDP while automatically inferring the
environment transition matrix. The proposed VIN-RS estimates the transition
matrix through a self-learned convolution filter while extracting environment
details from the input frames or sampled graphs. Due to (1) the previous
success of using message passing for reward shaping; and (2) the CNN planning
behavior, we use these messages to train the CNN of VIN-RS. Experiments are
performed on tabular games, Atari 2600 and MuJoCo, for discrete and continuous
action space. Our results illustrate promising improvements in the learning
speed and maximum cumulative reward compared to the state-of-the-art.

influence of the history of shock acceleration on the varying SEP time
intensity profiles and investigate the underlying causes in the origin of this
widespread SEP event. The temporal evolution of shock parameters and particle
fluxes during this event are examined. We find that adopting a realistic solar
wind background can significantly impact the expansion of the shock and
consequently the shock parameters. Time intensity profiles with an energetic
storm particle event at PSP are well reproduced from the simulation. In
addition, the simulated and observed time intensity profiles of protons show a
similar two-phase enhancement at STA. These results illustrate that modelling a
shock using a realistic solar wind is crucial in determining the
characteristics of SEP events. The decay phase of the modelled time intensity
profiles at Earth agrees well with observations, indicating the importance of
perpendicular diffusion in widespread SEP events. Taking into account the
possible large curved magnetic field line connecting to SolO, the modelled time
intensity profiles show good agreement with the observation. We suggest that
the largely distorted magnetic field lines due to a stream interaction region

that SE has near solar elemental abundance, while the ring appears to have

hierarchy must be estimated separately. Second, those models must maintain

complicated by performance degradation of the higher-level models in the

to correct this degradation of performance through a top-down approach using
odds, time series and systems of linear equations. Vertically, the total counts
of corresponding series at each sub-level are captured while horizontally odds

this paper, we study semantic communication from a topological space
perspective, in which higher-order data semantics live in a simplicial complex.
Specifically, a transmitter first maps its data into a $k$-order simplicial
complex and then learns its high-order correlations. The simplicial structure
and corresponding features are encoded into semantic embeddings in latent space
for transmission. Subsequently, the receiver decodes the structure and infers
the missing or distorted data. The transmitter and receiver collaboratively
train a simplicial convolutional autoencoder to accomplish the semantic
communication task. Experiments are carried out on a real dataset of Semantic
Scholar Open Research Corpus, where one part of the semantic embedding is
missing or distorted during communication. Numerical results show that the
simplicial convolutional autoencoder enabled semantic communication effectively
rebuilds the simplicial features and infer the missing data with $95\%$
accuracy, while achieving stable performance under channel noise. In contrast,
the conventional autoencoder enabled communication fails to infer any missing
data. Moreover, our approach is shown to effectively infer the distorted data

may be tempted here to appeal to the laws of nature, or to the world's
geometric structure, or even to the smooth topological structure of the
spacetime manifold itself. Some think, however, that the metaphysics involved
in such explanatory strategies is excessively spooky. Indeed, some opt to
reverse the arrow of explanation, putting dynamics first. For instance, one can
use Lewis's Best Systems Analysis (BSA) to view the laws of nature as merely
being codifications of certain patterns in the dynamical behavior of matter.
Similarly, one can use Huggett's Regularity Relationism to achieve an analogous
view of the world's geometric structure. At present, however, there is no such
dynamics-first view of the spacetime manifold itself. This dissertation puts
forward such a view: The spacetime manifold is merely a codification of certain
patterns in the dynamical behavior of matter.
  This dissertation develops powerful mathematical tools for investigating and
negotiating between a wide variety of spacetime settings for a wide range of
spacetime theories. From here, a competition between different spacetime
codifications is invoked analogous to the competition between different
law-like codifications in Lewis's BSA. Whereas the BSA judges law-like
codifications based on their balance of simplicity and strength, spacetime

and Esposite-Farese, a general relativistic branch becomes unstable to trigger
tachyonic growth of a scalar field $\phi$ toward a scalarized branch. Applying
this scenario to cosmology, there is fatal tachyonic instability of $\phi$
during inflation and matter dominance being incompatible with solar-system
constraints on today's field value $\phi_0$. In the presence of a four-point
coupling $g^2 \phi^2 \chi^2/2$ between $\phi$ and an inflaton field $\chi$, it
was argued by Anson et al. that a positive mass squared heavier than the square
of a Hubble expansion rate leads to the exponential suppression of $\phi$
during inflation and that $\phi_0$ can remain small even with the growth of
$\phi$ after the radiation-dominated epoch. For several inflaton potentials
approximated as $V(\chi)=m^2 \chi^2/2$ about the potential minimum, we study
the dynamics of $\phi$ during reheating as well as other cosmological epochs in
detail. For certain ranges of the coupling $g$, the homogeneous field $\phi$
can be amplified by parametric resonance during a coherent oscillation of the
inflaton. Incorporating the backreaction of created particles under a Hartree
approximation, the maximum values of $\phi$ reached during preheating are
significantly smaller than those obtained without the backreaction. We also
find that the minimum values of $g$ consistent with solar system bounds on
$\phi$ at the end of reheating are of order $10^{-5}$ and hence there is a wide
range of acceptable values of $g$. Thus, the scenario proposed by Anson et al.
naturally leads to the viable cosmological evolution of $\phi$ consistent with
local gravity constraints, without modifying the property of scalarized neutron
stars.

additional degree-of-freedom is used to send more information about the source

multiplexing scheme at lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values and smaller

polymer lengths on translocation dynamics is determined from the behavior of

The escape of polymer segments from the narrow end of the conical channel is
tracked by studying their velocity profile ($v_{s}$). To demonstrate the
asymmetric pore effects on the translocation dynamics, we compare the
translocation process from both the ends of the conical channel. We find
striking differences in the translocation dynamics for both processes, which

and the second is based on Fourier neural operators (FNO). Both of these were
trained, validated, and tested with results from the numerical solution of the
boundary-value problem (BVP) for quasi-static mechanical equilibrium in
periodic grain microstructures with square domains. More specifically, these
ANNs were trained to correlate the spatial distribution of material properties
with the equilibrium stress field under uniaxial tensile loading. The resulting
trained ANNs (tANNs) calculate the stress field for a given microstructure on
the order of 1000 (UNet) to 2500 (FNO) times faster than the numerical solution
of the corresponding BVP.
  For microstructures in the test dataset, the FNO-based tANN, or simply FNO,
is more accurate than its UNet-based counterpart; the normalized mean absolute
error of different stress components for the former is 0.25-0.40% as compared

regions, whereas the error in U-Net also comes from within the grain. In
comparison to U-Net, errors in FNO are more robust to large variations in
spatial resolution as well as small variations in grain density. On other hand,
errors in U-Net are robust to variations in boundary box aspect ratio, whereas
errors in FNO increase as the domain becomes rectangular. Both tANNs are

union of possibly disjoint fractures and pores. The support, material
properties, and interfacial condition of scatterers in (i) and (ii) are
unknown, while elastic constants of the matrix are provided. The domain
undergoes progressive variations of arbitrary chemo-mechanical origins such
that its geometric configuration and elastic properties at future times are
distinct. At every sensing step $t_\circ, t_1, \ldots,$ multi-modal incidents
are generated by a set of boundary excitations, and the resulting scattered
fields are captured over the observation surface. The test data are then used
to construct a sequence of wavefront densities by solving the spectral
scattering equation. The incident fields affiliated with distinct pairs of
obtained wavefronts are analyzed over the stationary and evolving scatterers

generation in several orders of magnitude, both in time and space efficiency.
Improving both time and space efficiency is made possible through devising a
new non-contiguous and hierarchical memory allocation method, called
Three-level Path Access Method (TPAM), that enables efficient storage of
maximal simple paths in memory. In addition to its high time and space
efficiency, a major significance of TPGen includes its self-stabilizing design
where threads execute in a fully asynchronous and order-oblivious way without
using any atomic instructions. TPGen can generate PPs and TPs of structurally
complex programs that have an extremely high cyclomatic and Npath complexity.

eigenvalue of the operator $-\Delta$ with the Dirichlet boundary in unit disk.
Our method relies on delicate and difficult analysis of radial solutions to the
above equation and careful asymptotic expansion of solutions near the boundary.
This uniqueness result will shed some light on solving the conjecture that
maximizers of the Trudinger-Moser inequality on the unit disc are unique.
Furthermore, based on this uniqueness result, we develop a new strategy to
establish the quantization property of elliptic equations with the critical
exponential growth in the balls of hyperbolic spaces, and obtain the
multiplicity and non-existence of positive critical points for super-critical
Trudinger-Moser functional. Our method for the quantization property and
non-existence of the critical points avoids using the complicated blow-up
analysis used in the literature. This method can also be applied to study the
similar problems in balls of high dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ or
hyperbolic spaces provided the uniqueness for the corresponding quasilinear
elliptic equations with the critical exponential growth is established.

operational smoothers rely either on affine Kalman-type transformations or on
sequential importance sampling. These strategies occupy opposite ends of a

generality and consistency: non-Gaussianity renders affine Kalman updates
inconsistent with the true Bayesian solution, while the ensemble size required
for successful importance sampling can be prohibitive. This paper revisits the
smoothing problem from the perspective of measure transport, which offers the
prospect of consistent prior-to-posterior transformations for Bayesian
inference. We leverage this capacity by proposing a general ensemble framework
for transport-based smoothing. Within this framework, we derive a comprehensive
set of smoothing recursions based on nonlinear transport maps and detail how
they exploit the structure of state-space models in fully non-Gaussian

steps. First, a gradient-based method is adopted to find the most vulnerable
words in the sentence. Then we split the selected words into subtokens to
replace the origin tokenization result from the transformer tokenizer. Finally,
we utilize an adversarial loss to guide the substitution of attachable
subtokens in which the Gumbel-softmax trick is introduced to ensure gradient
propagation. Meanwhile, we introduce the visual and length constraint in the
optimization process to achieve minimum character modifications. Extensive

sampling 3D object models from multiple viewpoints and with arbitrary partial
occlusions. We then augment the resulting set of point clouds through random
rotations and adding Gaussian noise to better emulate the real-world scenarios.
We then train point cloud encoding models, e.g., DGCNN, PointNet++, on the
synthesized and augmented datasets and evaluate their cross-domain
classification performance on corresponding real-world datasets. We also
introduce Point-Syn2Real, a new benchmark dataset for cross-domain learning on

an important probe of models of galaxy formation and evolution. Here, we report
Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope HI 21cm spectroscopy of blue star-forming
galaxies at $z\approx0.20-0.42$ in the Extended Groth Strip, which has allowed
us to determine the scaling relation between the average HI mass
($\rm{M_{HI}}$) and the absolute B-band magnitude ($\rm{M_B}$) of such galaxies
at $z \approx 0.35$, by stacking the HI 21cm emission signals of galaxy
subsamples in different $\rm{M_B}$ ranges. We combine this $\rm{M_{HI}-M_B}$
scaling relation (with a scatter assumed to be equal to that in the local
Universe) with the known B-band luminosity function of star-forming galaxies at
these redshifts to determine the HIMF at $z\approx0.35$. We show that the use
of the correct scatter in the $\rm{M_{HI}-M_B}$ scaling relation is critical
for an accurate estimate of the HIMF. We find that the HIMF has evolved
significantly from $z\approx0.35$ to $z\approx0$, i.e. over the last four Gyr,
especially at the high-mass end. High-mass galaxies, with
$\rm{M_{HI}\gtrsim10^{10}\ M_\odot}$, are a factor of $\approx3.4$ less
prevalent at $z\approx0.35$ than at $z \approx 0$. Conversely, there are more
low-mass galaxies, with $\rm{M_{HI} \approx10^9\ {M}_\odot}$, at $z\approx0.35$
than in the local Universe. While our results may be affected by cosmic
variance, we find that massive star-forming galaxies have acquired a
significant amount of HI through merger events or accretion from the
circumgalactic medium over the past four Gyr.

applied to many source code processing tasks. Due to the poor interpretability
of DL models, their security vulnerabilities require scrutiny. Recently,
researchers have identified an emergent security threat, namely poison attack.
The attackers aim to inject insidious backdoors into models by poisoning the
training data with poison samples. Poisoned models work normally with clean
inputs but produce targeted erroneous results with poisoned inputs embedded
with triggers. By activating backdoors, attackers can manipulate the poisoned
models in security-related scenarios.
  To verify the vulnerability of existing deep source code processing models to
the poison attack, we present a poison attack framework for source code named
CodePoisoner as a strong imaginary enemy. CodePoisoner can produce compilable
even human-imperceptible poison samples and attack models by poisoning the
training data with poison samples. To defend against the poison attack, we
further propose an effective defense approach named CodeDetector to detect
poison samples in the training data. CodeDetector can be applied to many model
architectures and effectively defend against multiple poison attack approaches.
We apply our CodePoisoner and CodeDetector to three tasks, including defect
detection, clone detection, and code repair. The results show that (1)
CodePoisoner achieves a high attack success rate (max: 100%) in misleading
models to targeted erroneous behaviors. It validates that existing deep source
code processing models have a strong vulnerability to the poison attack. (2)
CodeDetector effectively defends against multiple poison attack approaches by
detecting (max: 100%) poison samples in the training data. We hope this work
can help practitioners notice the poison attack and inspire the design of more

idea of this approach is to combine the strengths of both frameworks by merging
the TC method with the probabilistic modeling, which provides probabilistic

previously investigated in the literature as resource constrained job

tackle the deterministic problem, the uncertainty associated with resource
availability, an inevitable challenge in mining operations, has received less

study proposes an adaptive population-based simulated annealing algorithm that
can overcome the limitations of existing methods for RCJS with uncertainty
including the premature convergence, the excessive number of hyper-parameters,

using a population, modifying the cooling schedule in the Metropolis-Hastings

candidates for demonstrating the quantum advantage using near-term quantum
computers. Unfortunately, high device error rates limit us from reliably
running QAOA circuits for problems with more than a few qubits. In QAOA, the
problem graph is translated into a quantum circuit such that every edge
corresponds to two 2-qubit CNOT operations in each layer of the circuit. As
CNOTs are extremely error-prone, the fidelity of QAOA circuits is dictated by
the number of edges in the problem graph.
  We observe that majority of graphs corresponding to real-world applications
follow the ``power-law`` distribution, where some hotspot nodes have
significantly higher number of connections. We leverage this insight and
propose ``FrozenQubits`` that freezes the hotspot nodes or qubits and
intelligently partitions the state-space of the given problem into several
smaller sub-spaces which are then solved independently. The corresponding QAOA
sub-circuits are significantly less vulnerable to gate and decoherence errors
due to the reduced number of CNOT operations in each sub-circuit. Unlike prior
circuit-cutting approaches, FrozenQubits does not require any exponentially
complex post-processing step. Our evaluations with 5,300 QAOA circuits on eight
different quantum computers from IBM shows that FrozenQubits can improve the
quality of solutions by 8.73x on average (and by up to 57x), albeit utilizing
2x more quantum resources.

construct BICs in asymmetric metasurfaces. In this paper, we show that the
radiation channel of translational-symmetry (TS) protected BIC in 1D symmetric
dimer lattice could be unlocked by dimer spacing perturbation. A
semi-analytical coupled mode analysis reveals that the total radiation
suppression of the TS-BIC is due to the elimination of the first Fourier
harmonic component in the lattice parameters. TS-BIC mechanism could also be
applied in a 2D symmetric dimer lattice, and BICs protected by TS are robust to
RS breaking, and vice versa, providing a promising way to independently control
the quality factor of two interacting BIC resonances. Our results suggest a new
degree of freedom to engineer BICs as well as their interactions in dimer
lattices tailored by different symmetries, and could provide new insight for

  In this paper, we propose a pre-training task specialized in code editing and
present an effective pre-trained code editing model named CodeEditor. Our
pre-training task further improves the performance and generalization ability
of code editing models. Specifically, we collect real-world code snippets as
the ground truth and use a generator to rewrite them into natural but inferior
versions. Then, we pre-train our CodeEditor to edit inferior versions into the
ground truth, to learn edit patterns. We conduct experiments on four datasets
and evaluate models in three settings. (1) In the fine-tuning setting, we
fine-tune the pre-trained CodeEditor with four datasets. CodeEditor outperforms
SOTA baselines by 15%, 25.5%, and 9.4% and 26.6% on four datasets. (2) In the
few-shot setting, we fine-tune the pre-trained CodeEditor with limited data.
CodeEditor substantially performs better than all baselines, even outperforming

evaluate the pre-trained CodeEditor without fine-tuning. CodeEditor correctly
edits 1,113 programs while SOTA baselines can not work. The results prove that
the superiority of our pre-training task and the pre-trained CodeEditor is more

its structure whenever the mechanical system changes its topology or number of
degrees of freedom. A motion control scheme is proposed based on a projected
inverse-dynamics scheme which proves to be stable and minimizes the weighted
Euclidean norm of the actuation force. The projection-based control scheme is
further developed for constrained systems, e.g. parallel manipulators, which

spheroidal galaxy is being tidally destroyed while orbiting around the MW,
whose close passages perturb the MW disc externally. In this work, using a
series of hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate how massive dwarf galaxies
on quasi-polar Sgr-like orbits impact the star formation activity inside the
MW-like discs. First, we confirm that interactions with orbiting satellites
enhance the star formation rate in the host galaxy. However, prominent
short-time scale bursts are detected during the very close passages (<20 kpc)
of massive (>2\times 10^{10} \Msun) gas-poor satellites. In the case of
gas-rich satellites, while we see a substantial enhancement of the star
formation on a longer time scale, we do not detect prominent peaks in the star
formation history of the host. This can be explained by the steady accretion of
gas being stripped from the satellite, which smoothens short-term variations in
the star formation rate of the host. It is important that the impact of the
satellite perturbations, especially its first encounters, is seen mainly in the
outer~(>10 kpc) disc of the host. We also found that the close passages of
satellites cause the formation of a substantial amount of low-metallicity stars

from the satellites resulting in the dilution of the mean stellar metallicity
soon after the first pericentric passage of massive satellites. Our simulations
are in favour of causality between the recent passages of the Sgr galaxy and
the bursts of the star formation in the solar neighbourhood~(\approx 1 and
\approx 2 Gyr ago); however, in order to reproduce the SF burst at its first
infall (\approx 6 Gyr), we require a very close pericentric passage (<20 kpc)
with subsequent substantial mass loss of the Sgr precursor.

interesting aspect of solar flares is the presence of accelerated (nonthermal)

has been ongoing since the early days of the space age as to how these

mechanisms is by investigating short-timescale (tens of milliseconds)

Previous studies have suggested that relative to the main sequence population,
planets transiting evolved stars ($P$ $<$ 100 d) tend to have more eccentric
orbits. Here we present the discovery of TOI-4582 b, a 0.94 $\pm$ 0.12
R$_\mathrm{J}$, 0.53 $\pm$ 0.05 M$_\mathrm{J}$ planet orbiting an
intermediate-mass subgiant star every 31.034 days. We find that this planet is
also on a significantly eccentric orbit ($e$ = 0.51 $\pm$ 0.05). We then
compare the population of planets found transiting evolved (log$g$ $<$ 3.8)
stars to the population of planets transiting main sequence stars. We find that
the rate at which median orbital eccentricity grows with period is
significantly higher for evolved star systems than for otherwise similar main
sequence systems, particularly for systems with only one planet detected. In
general, we observe that mean planet eccentricity $<e>$ = $a$ +
$b$log$_{10}$($P$) for the evolved population with a single transiting planet
where $a$ = (-0.18 $\pm$ 0.08) and $b$ = (0.38 $\pm$ 0.06), significantly
distinct from the main sequence planetary system population. This trend is seen
even after controlling for stellar mass and metallicity. These systems do not
appear to represent a steady evolution pathway from eccentric, long-period
planetary orbits to circular, short period orbits, as orbital model comparisons
suggest inspiral timescales are uncorrelated with orbital separation or
eccentricity. Characterization of additional evolved planetary systems will
distinguish effects of stellar evolution from those of stellar mass and
composition.

unbiased but noisy preliminary estimates toward the average of these estimates,
is a common approach in statistical estimation problems because it is
well-known that shrinkage estimators have smaller mean squared errors than
unshrunk estimators. Inspired by this idea, we propose a computationally
tractable shrinkage rule that selects the shrinkage factor by minimizing an
upper bound of the maximum regret. Then, we compare the maximum regret of the
proposed shrinkage rule with that of CES and pooling rules when the parameter
space is correctly specified and misspecified. The theoretical and numerical
results show that our shrinkage rule performs well in many cases when the

been utilized to obtain the nuclear level density (NLD) of $^{71}$Ga and
$^{72}$Ga nuclei by using the statistical model (SM) calculations. It is seen
that the $\gamma$-gated proton spectrum are reasonably explained by using the
large value of the inverse level density parameter ($k$ = 11.2 MeV) in the NLD
prescription of the Fermi gas (FG) model. The large value of $k$ is indicative
of the rotational enhancement, which is consistent with the earlier results in
other mass regions. Furthermore, a rotational enhancement factor has been
included in the NLD and used in the SM calculation keeping the systematic value
of $k$=8.6 MeV and it explains the $\gamma$-gated proton spectrum nicely. The
result clearly indicates the presence of collective enhancement in NLD.
Subsequently, the NLD with collective enhancement has been utilized in the
TALYS calculation, for the first time, to calculate the $^{71}$Ga(n,
$\gamma$)$^{72}$Ga capture cross-section. It is observed that, while the FG
model without the collective enhancement in the NLD for $^{72}$Ga under
predicts the capture data, with the rotational enhancement correction the FG
model over predicts the data by similar amount at higher energies. However, in
the energy range of 0.01 MeV to 0.1 MeV, the FG model corrected for rotational
enhancement describes the data quite well. Thus, the present work indicates
that collective enhancement, whenever required, should be taken into account
fro proper description of low energy capture cross section data.

domain to a target domain without any constraints on label sets. Since both
domains may hold private classes, identifying target common samples for domain
alignment is an essential issue in UniDA. Most existing methods require
manually specified or hand-tuned threshold values to detect common samples thus
they are hard to extend to more realistic UniDA because of the diverse ratios
of common classes. Moreover, they cannot recognize different categories among
target-private samples as these private samples are treated as a whole. In this
paper, we propose to use Optimal Transport (OT) to handle these issues under a
unified framework, namely UniOT. First, an OT-based partial alignment with
adaptive filling is designed to detect common classes without any predefined
threshold values for realistic UniDA. It can automatically discover the
intrinsic difference between common and private classes based on the
statistical information of the assignment matrix obtained from OT. Second, we
propose an OT-based target representation learning that encourages both global
discrimination and local consistency of samples to avoid the over-reliance on
the source. Notably, UniOT is the first method with the capability to
automatically discover and recognize private categories in the target domain
for UniDA. Accordingly, we introduce a new metric H^3-score to evaluate the
performance in terms of both accuracy of common samples and clustering
performance of private ones. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate the
advantages of UniOT over a wide range of state-of-the-art methods in UniDA.

low-mass stellar objects by the introduction of centrifugal force to the

construct the models of rotating very low-mass stellar objects that may or may
not experience sustained nuclear reaction (hydrogen-burning) as their energy
source. The rotation is not limited to being slow so the effect of the
rotational deformation of them is not infinitesimally small. Critical curves of
sustainable hydrogen burning in the parameter space of mass versus central
degeneracy, on which the nuclear energy generation balances the surface
luminosity, are obtained for different values of angular momentum. It is shown
that if the angular momentum exceeds the threshold $J_0=8.85\times 10^{48}{\rm
erg}~{\rm s}$ the critical curve is broken up into two branches with lower and
higher degeneracy because of the mass-shedding limit. Based on the results, we
model mechano-thermal evolutions of substellar objects, in which cooling, as
well as mass/angular momentum reductions, are followed for two simplified
cases. The case with such external braking mechanisms as magnetized wind or
magnetic braking is mainly controlled by the spin-down timescale. The other
case with no external braking leads to the mass-shedding limit after
gravitational contraction. Thereafter the object sheds its mass to form a ring
or a disc surrounding it and shrinks.

solids from first principles and take it into account in our dynamics, which is
required to accurately capture spin dephasing at external magnetic fields. We
thereby predict intrinsic spin lifetimes as an upper bound for experiments,
identify the dominant spin relaxation pathways, and evaluate the dependence on
temperature, external fields, carrier density,and impurities. Importantly, we
find that the Fr{\""o}hlich interaction that dominates carrier relaxation
contributes negligibly to spin relaxation, consistent with the spin-conserving
nature of this interaction. We investigated the effect of spin-orbit field with
inversion asymmetry on spin lifetime, and we demonstrated from our calculation,
persistent spin helix can enhance spin lifetime when the spin-split is large,
but it can not be realized by Rashba SOC. Our theoretical approach may lead to
new strategies to optimize spin and carrier transport properties in spintronics
and quantum information applications.

In the basic formalism developed, the dynamical parameters are derived by

are showing accelerating behaviour and approaches to $\Lambda$CDM at late
time.The present value of the equation of state parameter for both the cases
are obtained to be in accordance with the range provided by cosmological

are performed to assess the viability of a late time accelerating Universe.
Further the stability of both the models are presented. It has been observed
that both the models are parameters dependent. Since most of the geometrically
modified theories of gravity are favouring the violation of strong energy

through a series of systematic studies, we find that LN might take 10\% of the
inference time despite that it only contributes to 0.1\% of the FLOPs. This
motivates us to replace LN with other normalization techniques, e.g., Batch
Normalization~(BN), to speed up inference with the help of operator fusion
methods and the avoidance of calculating the mean and variance statistics
during inference. After examining several plain attempts which directly remove
all LN layers or replace them with BN in the same place, we find that the
divergence issue is mainly caused by the unstable layer output. We therefore
propose to append a BN layer to each linear or convolution layer where
stabilized training results are observed. We also propose to simplify the
activations in Conformer, such as Swish and GLU, by replacing them with ReLU.
All these exchanged modules can be fused into the weights of the adjacent
linear/convolution layers and hence have zero inference cost. Therefore, we
name it FusionFormer. Our experiments indicate that FusionFormer is as
effective as the LN-based Conformer and is about 10\% faster.

because it provides brand new physical principles to manipulate light. Band
topology of optical materials is characterized using the Berry phase defined by
Bloch states. Until now, the criteria for experimentally probing the
topological phase transition of band topology has always been relatively
lacking in topological physics. Moreover, radiation topology can be aroused by
the far-field polarizations of the radiating Bloch states, which is described
by the Stokes phase. Although such two types of topologies are both related to
Bloch states on the band structure, it is rather surprising that their
development is almost independent. Here, we reveal that the phase transition of
band topology can be probed by the radiation topology. We theoretically design
and experimentally demonstrate such an intriguing phenomenon by constructing
photonic crystals that support optical analogs of quantum spin Hall effects.
The results show that the topological charge of the far-field polarization
vortex changes from +1 to -2 or from -2 to +1 when the band topology changes
from trivial to non-trivial, which provides a new criterion to probe the phase
transition of band topology using radiation topology. Our findings not only
provide an insightful understanding of band topology and radiation topology,

datasets, the performance of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) may suffer from reduced
accuracy compared to other Machine Learning models. Furthermore, it is
difficult to construct prediction intervals or evaluate the uncertainty of
predictions when dealing with regression tasks. In this paper, we propose an

increase their accuracy and provide an interval for the expected variation.
Compared with traditional DNNs that only provide a prediction, our proposed

design, this approach significantly increases accuracy on small datasets and
does not introduce much complexity to the architecture of the neural network.

phase by tuning the strength of the quasiperiodic potential. Here we unearth
that the disorder strength $\Delta$ contributes an independent relevant
direction near the critical point of the AA model. Our scaling analyses show
that the localization length $\xi$ scales with $\Delta$ as
$\xi\propto\Delta^{-\nu_\Delta}$ with $\nu_\Delta$ a new critical exponent,
which is estimated to be $\nu_\Delta\approx0.46$. This value is remarkably
different from the counterparts for both the pure AA model and the Anderson
model. Moreover, rich critical phenomena are discovered in the critical region
spanned by the quasiperiodic and the disordered potentials. In particular, in
the extended phase side, we show that the scaling theory satisfy a hybrid
scaling form as a result of the overlap between the critical regions of the AA
model and the Anderson localization.

challenge in approaching explainable QA. A recently proposed structured
reasoning format, entailment tree, manages to offer explicit logical deductions
with entailment steps in a tree structure. To generate entailment trees, prior
single pass sequence-to-sequence models lack visible internal decision
probability, while stepwise approaches are supervised with extracted single
step data and cannot model the tree as a whole. In this work, we propose RLET,
a Reinforcement Learning based Entailment Tree generation framework, which is
trained utilising the cumulative signals across the whole tree. RLET
iteratively performs single step reasoning with sentence selection and
deduction generation modules, from which the training signal is accumulated
across the tree with elaborately designed aligned reward function that is
consistent with the evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
to introduce RL into the entailment tree generation task. Experiments on three
settings of the EntailmentBank dataset demonstrate the strength of using RL

introduces knowledge distillation (KD) to achieve better tradeoffs, where
knowledge from a complicated teacher autoencoder is transferred to a
lightweight student autoencoder for performance improvement. Specifically, two
methods are proposed for implementation. Firstly, an autoencoder KD-based
method is introduced by training a student autoencoder to mimic the
reconstructed CSI of a pretrained teacher autoencoder. Secondly, an encoder
KD-based method is proposed to reduce training overhead by performing KD only

self-attention. Many methods limit the range of attention within a local window
to reduce computation complexity. However, their approaches cannot save the
number of parameters; meanwhile, the self-attention and inner position bias
(inside the softmax function) cause each query to focus on similar and close
patches. Consequently, this paper presents a light self-limited-attention
(LSLA) consisting of a light self-attention mechanism (LSA) to save the
computation cost and the number of parameters, and a self-limited-attention
mechanism (SLA) to improve the performance. Firstly, the LSA replaces the K
(Key) and V (Value) of self-attention with the X(origin input). Applying it in
vision Transformers which have encoder architecture and self-attention
mechanism, can simplify the computation. Secondly, the SLA has a positional
information module and a limited-attention module. The former contains a
dynamic scale and an inner position bias to adjust the distribution of the
self-attention scores and enhance the positional information. The latter uses
an outer position bias after the softmax function to limit some large values of
attention weights. Finally, a hierarchical Vision Transformer with Light
self-Limited-attention (ViT-LSLA) is presented. The experiments show that
ViT-LSLA achieves 71.6% top-1 accuracy on IP102 (2.4% absolute improvement of
Swin-T); 87.2% top-1 accuracy on Mini-ImageNet (3.7% absolute improvement of
Swin-T). Furthermore, it greatly reduces FLOPs (3.5GFLOPs vs. 4.5GFLOPs of
Swin-T) and parameters (18.9M vs. 27.6M of Swin-T).

  model",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In this paper we model the size-effects of metamaterial beams under bending
with the aid of the relaxed micromorphic continuum. We analyze first the
size-dependent bending stiffness of heterogeneous fully discretized
metamaterial beams subjected to pure bending loads. Two equivalent loading
schemes are introduced which lead to a constant moment along the beam length
with no shear force. The relaxed micromorphic model is employed then to
retrieve the size-effects. We present a procedure for the determination of the
material parameters of the relaxed micromorphic model based on the fact that
the model operates between two well-defined scales. These scales are given by
linear elasticity with micro and macro elasticity tensors which bound the
relaxed micromorphic continuum from above and below, respectively. The micro
elasticity tensor is specified as the maximum possible stiffness that is
exhibited by the assumed metamaterial while the macro elasticity tensor is
given by standard periodic first-order homogenization. For the identification
of the micro elasticity tensor, two different approaches are shown which rely
on affine and non-affine Dirichlet boundary conditions of candidate unit cell
variants with the possible stiffest response. The consistent coupling condition
is shown to allow the model to act on the whole intended range between macro
and micro elasticity tensors for both loading cases. We fit the relaxed
micromorphic model against the fully resolved metamaterial solution by
controlling the curvature magnitude after linking it with the specimen's size.
The obtained parameters of the relaxed micromorphic model are tested for two
additional loading scenarios.

interacting disk galaxies using the results of idealized collisionless Nbody
simulations of the galaxies. In order to better understand the mechanism, we
investigate orbital eccentricities (e), epochs of apocenter passages (t_a),
azimuthal angles at t_a (varphi_a), precession rates (Omega_pre), for
individual stars, as well as bar strengths represented by relative m=2 Fourier
amplitude (A_2) and bar pattern speeds (Omega_bar). The main results are as
follows. A significant fraction of stars with initially different varphi_a and
Omega_pre in an isolated disk galaxy can have similar values within several
dynamical timescales. This synchronization of varphi_a and Omega_pre, which is
referred to as apsidal precession synchronization (``APS'') in the present
study, is caused by the enhanced strength of the tangential component of
gravitational force. A weak seed bar (A_2<0.1) is first formed through APS in
local regions of a disk, then the bar grows due to APS. In the bar growth phase
(0.1<A_2<0.4), APS can proceed more efficiently due to stronger tangential
force from the bar so that it can enhance the bar strength further. This
positive feedback loop in APS is the key physical mechanism of bar growth in
isolated stellar disks. Bar formation can be severely suppressed in disks with
lower disk mass fractions and/or higher $Q$ parameters due to much less
efficient APS. APS proceeds more rapidly and more efficiently due to strong
tidal perturbation in the formation of tidal bars compared to spontaneous bar
formation.

systematic errors in flat-fielding. The very blue colours, including uJAVA-r,
J0378-r, J0390-r, uJPAS-r, show the strongest metallicity dependence, around
0.25 mag/dex. The sensitivities decrease to about 0.1 mag/dex for the J0400-r,

(GW) detection resides in the laser phase noise, typically 7 to 8 orders of
magnitude above the inevitable noise. The arm locking technique was proposed to
suppress the noise in pre-stabilized laser beams. Based on the feedback control
theory, it is implemented by appropriate design of the signal routing
architecture, particularly the controllers' transfer functions. Theoretically
and experimentally, the technique has been demonstrated to be capable of
suppressing the laser phase noise by approximately 2-4 orders of magnitude
while taking into account various aspects such as the gain and distribution of
nulls in the Bode plot and the laser frequency pulling associated with the
Doppler frequency subtraction. Consequently, the resultant noise floor is
composed of the sources attributed to the clock jitter, optical bench motion,
test mass fluctuations, shot-noise phase fluctuations at the photodetectors,
whereas the magnitudes of these noises largely remain unchanged during the
process. Besides, the original GW signals are deformed through the arm-locking
control loop and therefore bear specific features governed by the associated
arm-locking scheme. Nonetheless, the remaining laser phase noise from the
arm-locking feedback routing settles within the capability threshold of the
time-delay interferometry (TDI). In this regard, it is generally understood
that the output of arm locking furnishes the input of TDI, through which the
residual noise is further reduced to the desired level at a post-processing
stage. In this work, we investigate the specific schemes regarding how the arm
locking output is processed further by the TDI algorithm. Specific forms of the
TDI combinations are derived in accordance with suppressed laser phase noise
and deformed signals of GW.

fields. They have locally independent filters and can use large kernels, which
contradicts the previously popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs
success was attributed to the hard-coded inductive biases of locality and
spatial invariance. However, recent studies have shown that inductive biases in
CNNs are too restrictive. On the other hand, the relative position encodings,
similar to depthwise (DW) convolution, are necessary for the local SA networks,
which indicates that the SA structures are not entirely spatially variant.
Hence, we would like to determine which part of inductive biases contributes to
the success of the local SA structures. To do so, we introduced context-aware
decomposed attention (CADA), which decomposes attention maps into multiple
trainable base kernels and accumulates them using context-aware (CA)
parameters. This way, we could identify the link between the CNNs and SA
networks. We conducted ablation studies using the ResNet50 applied to the
ImageNet classification task. DW convolution could have a large locality
without increasing computational costs compared to CNNs, but the accuracy
saturates with larger kernels. CADA follows this characteristic of locality. We
showed that context awareness was the crucial property; however, large local
information was not necessary to construct CA parameters. Even though no
spatial invariance makes training difficult, more relaxed spatial invariance
gave better accuracy than strict spatial invariance. Also, additional strong
spatial invariance through relative position encoding was preferable. We
extended these experiments to filters for downsampling and showed that locality
bias is more critical for downsampling but can remove the strong locality bias
using relaxed spatial invariance.

network frameworks. In this paper, a gradient decay hyperparameter is
introduced in Softmax to control the probability-dependent gradient decay rate
during training. By following the theoretical analysis and empirical results of
a variety of model architectures trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN, we
find that the generalization performance depends significantly on the gradient
decay rate as the confidence probability rises, i.e., the gradient decreases
convexly or concavely as the sample probability increases. Moreover,
optimization with the small gradient decay shows a similar curriculum learning
sequence where hard samples are in the spotlight only after easy samples are
convinced sufficiently, and well-separated samples gain a higher gradient to
reduce intra-class distance. Based on the analysis results, we can provide
evidence that the large margin Softmax will affect the local Lipschitz
constraint of the loss function by regulating the probability-dependent
gradient decay rate. This paper provides a new perspective and understanding of
the relationship among concepts of large margin Softmax, local Lipschitz
constraint and curriculum learning by analyzing the gradient decay rate.
Besides, we propose a warm-up strategy to dynamically adjust Softmax loss in
training, where the gradient decay rate increases from over-small to speed up
the convergence rate.

speech intelligibility and quality -- this is known as near-end listening
enhancement (NLE). Although, existing NLE techniques are able to greatly
increase intelligibility in harsh noise environments, in favorable noise
conditions the intelligibility of speech reaches a ceiling where it cannot be
further enhanced. Actually, the focus of existing methods solely on improving
the intelligibility causes unnecessary processing of the speech signal and
leads to speech distortions and quality degradations. In this paper, we provide
a new rationale for NLE, where the target speech is minimally processed in
terms of a processing penalty, provided that a certain performance constraint,
e.g., intelligibility, is satisfied. We present a closed-form solution for the
case where the performance criterion is an intelligibility estimator based on
the approximated speech intelligibility index and the processing penalty is the
mean-square error between the processed and the clean speech. This produces an
NLE method that adapts to changing noise conditions via a simple gain rule by

currently a popular topic for research and development, both in academia and

encryption, for distributed processing as in federated machine learning and
secure multiparty computation, and for trading data access or ownership.
However, these systems typically support only one of these solutions, while
organisations often have a variety of data and use cases for which different
solutions are appropriate. If a single system could be built that is flexible
enough to support a variety of solutions, then administration would be greatly
simplified and attack surfaces reduced. In this paper we present Mahiru, a
design for a data exchange and processing system in which owners of data and

collaborate to execute those requests in a distributed fashion, while ensuring
that the policies are adhered to at all times. This is achieved through a
federated, mostly decentralised architecture and a powerful policy mechanism

instance-level explanations, which produce explanations tailored to a given

a novel model-level GNN explanation method that explains what the underlying
GNN model has learned for graph classification by discovering
human-interpretable prototype graphs. Our method produces explanations for a
given class, thus being capable of offering more concise and comprehensive
explanations than those of instance-level explanations. First, PAGE selects
embeddings of class-discriminative input graphs on the graph-level embedding
space after clustering them. Then, PAGE discovers a common subgraph pattern by
iteratively searching for high matching node tuples using node-level embeddings
via a prototype scoring function, thereby yielding a prototype graph as our
explanation. Using five graph classification datasets, we demonstrate that PAGE
qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms the state-of-the-art model-level
explanation method. We also carry out experimental studies systematically by
showing the relationship between PAGE and instance-level explanation methods,
the robustness of PAGE to input data scarce environments, and the computational

of star formation and galaxy evolution due to their luminosity and variability;
395 LPVs in Field 1 and 671 LPVs in Field 2 have been identified. These two

derive four types of noise capable of explaining half of the inaccuracy found
in content reported as misinformation. We finally show that breaking down the
user reporting signal into a plurality of behaviours allows to train a simple,
although competitive, classifier on a small dataset with a combination of basic
users-reports to classify the different types of reported content pieces.

hashing, which learns a binary code for every document and employs Hamming
distance to evaluate document distances. However, existing semantic hashing
methods are mostly established on outdated TFIDF features, which obviously do
not contain lots of important semantic information about documents.
Furthermore, the Hamming distance can only be equal to one of several integer
values, significantly limiting its representational ability for document
distances. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose to leverage BERT
embeddings to perform efficient retrieval based on the product quantization
technique, which will assign for every document a real-valued codeword from the
codebook, instead of a binary code as in semantic hashing. Specifically, we
first transform the original BERT embeddings via a learnable mapping and feed
the transformed embedding into a probabilistic product quantization module to
output the assigned codeword. The refining and quantizing modules can be
optimized in an end-to-end manner by minimizing the probabilistic contrastive
loss. A mutual information maximization based method is further proposed to
improve the representativeness of codewords, so that documents can be quantized
more accurately. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmarks
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art baselines.

reduced pause times. They require far more CPU cycles and memory than prior
simpler collectors. concurrent copying collectors (C4, ZGC, and Shenandoah)
suffer from the following design limitations. 1) Concurrent copying. They only
reclaim memory by copying, which is inherently expensive with high memory
bandwidth demands. Concurrent copying also requires expensive read and write
barriers. 2) Scalability. They depend on tracing, which in the limit and in
practice does not scale. 3) Immediacy. They do not reclaim older objects
promptly, incurring high memory overheads.
  We present LXR, which takes a very different approach to optimizing
responsiveness and throughput by minimizing concurrent collection work and
overheads. 1) LXR reclaims most memory without any copying by using the Immix
heap structure. It then combats fragmentation with limited judicious
stop-the-world copying. 2) LXR uses reference counting to achieve both
scalability and immediacy, promptly reclaiming young and old objects. It uses
concurrent tracing as needed for identifying cyclic garbage. 3) To minimize
pause times while allowing judicious copying of mature objects, LXR introduces
remembered sets for reference counting and concurrent decrement processing. 4)
LXR introduces a novel low-overhead write barrier that combines coalescing
reference counting, concurrent tracing, and remembered set maintenance.
  The result is a collector with excellent responsiveness and throughput. On
the widely-used Lucene search engine with a generously sized heap, LXR has 6x
higher throughput while delivering 30x lower 99.9 percentile tail latency than
the popular Shenandoah production collector in its default configuration.

considerations about secondary gravitational waves induced at nonlinear order
in cosmological perturbations. We consider a consistent perturbative expansion
to third-order in cosmological perturbations, including higher-order
interactions and iterative solutions ignored in the previous literature. Tensor
fluctuations induced by the source with two scalar and one tensor perturbations
are correlated with the first-order tensor fluctuation and thus give a
one-loop-order correction to the tensor power spectrum. The missing loop
correction is \textit{scale-invariant} and \textit{negative} in the superhorion
region, which secondarily reduces the initial primordial tensor power spectrum
prior to the horizon re-entry. Such an IR behavior is very different from the
auto-spectrum of second-order induced tensor modes discussed in the previous
literature and can be important for the actual gravitational wave measurements.
For a sharp peak of scalar fluctuations with $A_\zeta=10^{-2}$ at
$k_*=10^{5}h/{\rm Mpc}$ motivated by the LIGO/Virgo events, we show that the
tensor power spectrum at the cosmic microwave background scale reduces by at
most 35%. Hence, the polarization B-mode might not be seen because of the
reduction of the original tensor spectrum due to the secondary effect of
primordial black hole formation.

permutation of jobs, is widely used in manufacturing systems. When solving the
large-scale PFSS problems, traditional optimization algorithms such as
heuristics could hardly meet the demands of both solution accuracy and
computational efficiency. Thus learning-based methods have recently garnered
more attention. Some work attempts to solve the problems by reinforcement
learning methods, which suffer from slow convergence issues during training and
are still not accurate enough regarding the solutions. To that end, we train
the model via expert-driven imitation learning, which accelerates the
convergence more stably and accurately. Moreover, in order to extract better
feature representations of input jobs, we incorporate the graph structure as
the encoder. The extensive experiments reveal that our proposed model obtains
significant promotion and presents excellent generalizability in large-scale
problems with up to 1000 jobs. Compared to the state-of-the-art reinforcement
learning method, our model's network parameters are reduced to only 37\% of
theirs, and the solution gap of our model towards the expert solutions
decreases from 6.8\% to 1.3\% on average.

end, we propose a novel Neural Architecture Search method via Automatic
Subspace Evoking (ASE-NAS) that finds promising architectures in automatically
evoked subspaces. Specifically, we first perform a global search, i.e.,
automatic subspace evoking, to evoke/find a good subspace from a set of
candidates. Then, we perform a local search within the evoked subspace to find
an effective architecture. More critically, we further boost search performance
by taking well-designed/searched architectures as the initial candidate

  Recognition",,,,,"cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Airwriting Recognition is the task of identifying letters written in free
space with finger movement. Electromyography (EMG) is a technique used to
record electrical activity during muscle contraction and relaxation as a result
of movement and is widely used for gesture recognition. Most of the current
research in gesture recognition is focused on identifying static gestures.
However, dynamic gestures are natural and user-friendly for being used as
alternate input methods in Human-Computer Interaction applications. Airwriting
recognition using EMG signals recorded from forearm muscles is therefore a
viable solution. Since the user does not need to learn any new gestures and a
large range of words can be formed by concatenating these letters, it is
generalizable to a wider population. There has been limited work in recognition
of airwriting using EMG signals and forms the core idea of the current work.
The SurfMyoAiR dataset comprising of EMG signals recorded during writing
English uppercase alphabets is constructed. Several different time-domain
features to construct EMG envelope and two different time-frequency image
representations: Short-Time Fourier Transform and Continuous Wavelet Transform
were explored to form the input to a deep learning model for airwriting
recognition. Several different deep learning architectures were exploited for
this task. Additionally, the effect of various parameters such as signal
length, window length and interpolation techniques on the recognition
performance is comprehensively explored. The best-achieved accuracy was 78.50%
and 62.19% in user-dependent and independent scenarios respectively by using
Short-Time Fourier Transform in conjunction with a 2D Convolutional Neural
Network based classifier. Airwriting has great potential as a user-friendly
modality to be used as an alternate input method in Human-Computer Interaction
applications.

and SDSS galaxy groups to measure the conditional luminosity function (CLF) for
groups with halo mass $M_{\rm h}\ge 10^{12}M_{\odot}$ and redshift $0.01\le
z\le 0.08$, down to a limiting $r$-band magnitude of $M_{\rm r}=-10\sim-12$.
For a given halo mass we measure the CLF for the total satellite population, as
well as separately for the red and blue populations classified using the
$(g-z)$ color. We find a clear faint-end upturn in the CLF of red satellites,
with a slope $\alpha\approx-1.8$ which is almost independent of halo mass. This
faint-end upturn is not seen for blue satellites and for the total population.
Our stellar population synthesis modeling shows that the $(g-z)$ color provides
a clean red/blue division, and that group galaxies in the red population
defined by $(g-z)$ are all dominated by old stellar populations. The fraction
of old galaxies as a function of galaxy luminosity shows a minimum at a
luminosity $M_{\rm r}\sim-18$, corresponding to a stellar mass
$M_\ast\sim10^{9.5}M_\odot$. This mass scale is independent of halo mass and is
comparable to the characteristic luminosity at which galaxies show a dichotomy
in surface brightness and size, suggesting that the dichotomy in the old
fraction and in galaxy structure may have a common origin. The rising of the
old fraction at the faint end for Milky Way (MW)-sized halos found here is in
good agreement with the quenched fraction measured both for the MW/M31 system
and from the ELVES survey. We discuss the implications of our results for the
formation and evolution of low-mass galaxies, and for the stellar mass
functions of low-mass galaxies to be observed at high redshift.

metric fluctuations and to take into account the renormalization group flow of
the metric-tensor distribution function from the UV to the IR boundary. Here,
renormalization effects at a given disorder configuration are described by the

flows. Particularly, the variation of flow quantities from the turbulent to
non-turbulent region is studied. While the enstrophy exhibits a sharp jump, the
other quantities (e.g., mean velocity, Reynolds normal stress, and kinetic
energy) show a continuous variation across the interface. The budget analysis
of Reynolds normal stresses reveals that the terms playing a key role in
turbulence transportation vary depending on the Reynolds normal stress under
study. The terms production, diffusion, and redistribution play an important
role in streamwise Reynolds stress {\dh}u0u0 {\TH}. In the spanwise Reynolds
stress {\dh}v0v0 {\TH}, the diffusion terms play a significant role. In the
wall-normal Reynolds stress {\dh}w0w0 {\TH}, only the redistribution term is
significant. The influence of one flow over another in the co-flow state was
observed through the additional mean velocity and Reynolds normal stress found
in the system compared to a standard plane Couette flow (pCf). Comparing the
co-flow system with a conventional pCf system, the former exhibits greater
vorticity, vortex stretching, and kinetic energy. A detailed analysis on the
geometry and topology of flow structures was studied using flow invariants.

discuss the consequences of two types of disorder: (i) random-coupling disorder
and (ii) singular-coupling disorder. They exhibit qualitatively similar effects
in the pure Kitaev-Heisenberg model without long-range interactions. The range
of spin liquid phases is reduced and the transition to magnetic ordered phases
becomes more crossover-like. Furthermore, the long-range zigzag and stripy
orderings in the clean system are replaced by their three domains with
different ordering direction. Especially in the crossover range the coexistence
of magnetically ordered and Kitaev spin-liquid domains is possible. With
increasing the disorder strength the area of domains becomes smaller and the
system goes into a spin-glass state. However, the disorder effect is different
in magnetically ordered phases caused by long-range interactions. The stability
of such magnetic ordering is diminished by singular-coupling disorder, and
accordingly, the range of spin-liquid regime is extended. This mechanism may be
relevant to materials like $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$ where the
zigzag ground state is stabilized by weak long-range interactions. We also find
that the flux gap closes at a critical disorder strength and vortices appears
in the flux arrangement. Interestingly, the vortices tend to form kinds of
commensurate ordering.

channel estimation is essential for the subsequent data transmission but is
realized at the cost of massive pilot overhead due to hundreds of antennas at
base station (BS). In order to reduce the pilot overhead without compromising
the estimation, compressive sensing (CS) based methods have been widely applied
for channel estimation by exploiting the inherent sparse structure of massive
MIMO channel in angular domain. However, they still suffer from high complexity
during optimization process and the requirement of prior knowledge on sparsity
information. To overcome these challenges, this paper develops a novel hybrid
channel estimation framework by integrating the model-driven CS and data-driven
deep unrolling techniques. The proposed framework is composed of a coarse
estimation part and a fine correction part, which is implemented in a two-stage
manner to exploit both inter- and intra-frame sparsities of channels in angular

many local minima are connected through low-loss valleys. Yet, little is known

for finding continuous symmetries in the parameter space, which carve out
low-loss valleys. Our framework uses equivariances of the activation functions

framework to nonlinear neural networks, we introduce a novel set of nonlinear,
data-dependent symmetries. These symmetries can transform a trained model such
that it performs similarly on new samples, which allows ensemble building that
improves robustness under certain adversarial attacks. We then show that
conserved quantities associated with linear symmetries can be used to define
coordinates along low-loss valleys. The conserved quantities help reveal that
using common initialization methods, gradient flow only explores a small part
of the global minimum. By relating conserved quantities to convergence rate and
sharpness of the minimum, we provide insights on how initialization impacts
convergence and generalizability.

surrounded by circumstellar disks and b) launch magnetically-driven jets and
outflows. The disk formation and global evolution is thereby controlled by
advection of angular momentum from large scales, the efficiency of magnetic
braking and the resistivity of the medium, and the internal thermal and
magnetic pressures of the disk. We perform a series of 30 simulations of a
massive star forming from the gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud
threaded by an initially-uniform magnetic field, starting from different values
for the mass of the cloud, its initial density and rotation profiles, its
rotational energy content, the magnetic field strength, and the resistivity of
the material. The gas and dust is modeled with the methods of resistive
magnetohydrodynamics, also considering radiation transport of thermal emission
and self-gravity. After the initial infall phase dominated by the gravitational
collapse, an accretion disk is formed, shortly followed by the launching of
magnetically-driven outflows. Two layers can be distinguished in the accretion
disk: a thin layer, vertically supported by thermal pressure, and a thick
layer, vertically supported by magnetic pressure. We observe the effects of
magnetic braking in the inner ~50 au of the disk at late times in our fiducial
case. The parameter study reveals that the size of the disk is mostly
determined by the density and rotation profiles of the initial mass reservoir
and not by the magnetic field strength. Magnetic pressure can slightly increase
the size of the accretion disk, while magnetic braking is more relevant in the
innermost parts of the disk as opposed to the outer disk. From the parameter
study, we infer that multiple initial conditions for the onset of gravitational
collapse are able to produce a given disk size and protostellar mass.

high computation overhead. Sparsely activated models, usually in the form of
Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, have constant computation cost over
their dense counterparts, thus providing opportunities to train and serve a
large model at a reasonable cost. However, the distributed training of an MoE
model is prone to low efficiency, mainly due to the interleaved all-to-all

  This paper makes three main contributions. First, we systematically analyze
the all-to-all overhead in distributed training of MoE. Second, we propose a
new communication scheduling scheme based on tensor partitioning that
prioritizes the all-to-all operations over other communication, due to its
blocking nature. Third, we introduce expert packing that reduces the all-to-all
transfer size and incorporates optimizations to mitigate its overheads. Both
techniques effectively tackle the all-to-all bottleneck, and we integrate them
into a new system called Lina. Experiments on an A100 GPU testbed show that
Lina improves the training step time of popular NLP models by up to 1.73x over

with data and are highly interpretable, which makes them useful for decision
support, e.g. in healthcare. While some research has been published on the
federated learning of Bayesian networks, publications on Bayesian networks in a
vertically partitioned or heterogeneous data setting (where different variables
are located in different datasets) are limited, and suffer from important
omissions, such as the handling of missing data. In this article, we propose a
novel method called VertiBayes to train Bayesian networks (structure and
parameters) on vertically partitioned data, which can handle missing values as
well as an arbitrary number of parties. For structure learning we adapted the
widely used K2 algorithm with a privacy-preserving scalar product protocol. For
parameter learning, we use a two-step approach: first, we learn an intermediate
model using maximum likelihood by treating missing values as a special value
and then we train a model on synthetic data generated by the intermediate model
using the EM algorithm. The privacy guarantees of our approach are equivalent
to the ones provided by the privacy preserving scalar product protocol used. We
experimentally show our approach produces models comparable to those learnt
using traditional algorithms and we estimate the increase in complexity in
terms of samples, network size, and complexity. Finally, we propose two
alternative approaches to estimate the performance of the model using
vertically partitioned data and we show in experiments that they lead to
reasonably accurate estimates.

films is important for a wide range of industrial processes. The cantilever
experiment allows the stress in a drying film that has been deposited onto a
thin plate to be quantified. Mechanical stresses in the film are transmitted to
the plate and drive bending. Mathematical modelling enables the film stress to
be inferred from measurements of the plate deflection. The aim of this paper is
to present simplified models of the cantilever experiment that have been
derived from the time-dependent equations of continuum mechanics using
asymptotic methods. The film is described using nonlinear poroelasticity and
the plate using nonlinear elasticity. In contrast to Stoney-like formulae, the
simplified models account for films with non-uniform thickness and stress. The
film model reduces to a single differential equation that can be solved
independently of the plate equations. The plate model reduces to an extended
form of the Foppl-von Karman (FvK) equations that accounts for gradients in the
longitudinal traction acting on the plate surface. Consistent boundary
conditions for the FvK equations are derived by resolving the Saint-Venant
boundary layers at the free edges of the plate. The asymptotically reduced
models are in excellent agreement with finite element solutions of the full
governing equations. As the P\'eclet number increases, the time evolution of
the plate deflection changes from $t$ to $t^{1/2}$, in agreement with

They interpolate between the Wasserstein metric and f-divergences and provide a
flexible family of loss functions for non-absolutely continuous (e.g.
empirical) distributions, possibly with heavy tails. We construct Lipschitz
regularized gradient flows on the space of probability measures based on these
divergences. Examples of such gradient flows are Lipschitz regularized
Fokker-Planck and porous medium partial differential equations (PDEs) for the
Kullback-Leibler and alpha-divergences, respectively. The regularization
corresponds to imposing a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy numerical stability condition
on the PDEs. For empirical measures, the Lipschitz regularization on gradient
flows induces a numerically stable transporter/discriminator particle
algorithm, where the generative particles are transported along the gradient of
the discriminator. The gradient structure leads to a regularized Fisher
information (particle kinetic energy) used to track the convergence of the
algorithm. The Lipschitz regularized discriminator can be implemented via
neural network spectral normalization and the particle algorithm generates
approximate samples from possibly high-dimensional distributions known only
from data. Notably, our particle algorithm can generate synthetic data even in
small sample size regimes. A new data processing inequality for the regularized
divergence allows us to combine our particle algorithm with representation
learning, e.g. autoencoder architectures. The resulting algorithm yields
markedly improved generative properties in terms of efficiency and quality of
the synthetic samples. From a statistical mechanics perspective the encoding
can be interpreted dynamically as learning a better mobility for the generative

molecular junctions display transport characteristics consistent with coherent

listener? We approach this question within the frame of Habermas' theory of
communicative action, which posits that the illocutionary intent of the message
(its pragmatic meaning) is the key. Thanks to recent advances in natural
language processing, we are able to operationalize this theory by extracting
the latent social dimensions of a message, namely archetypes of social intent
of language, that come from social exchange theory. We identify key ingredients
to opinion change by looking at more than 46k posts and more than 3.5M comments
on Reddit's r/ChangeMyView, a debate forum where people try to change each
other's opinion and explicitly mark opinion-changing comments with a special
flag called ""delta"". Comments that express no intent are about 77% less likely
to change the mind of the recipient, compared to comments that convey at least
one social dimension. Among the various social dimensions, the ones that are
most likely to produce an opinion change are knowledge, similarity, and trust,
which resonates with Habermas' theory of communicative action. We also find
other new important dimensions, such as appeals to power or empathetic
expressions of support. Finally, in line with theories of constructive
conflict, yet contrary to the popular characterization of conflict as the bane
of modern social media, our findings show that voicing conflict in the context
of a structured public debate can promote integration, especially when it is
used to counter another conflictive stance. By leveraging recent advances in
natural language processing, our work provides an empirical framework for
Habermas' theory, finds concrete examples of its effects in the wild, and
suggests its possible extension with a more faceted understanding of intent
interpreted as social dimensions of language.

models have been pre-trained on large-scale code corpora and perform well in
code generation. In this paper, we investigate how to equip pre-trained
language models with the ability of code generation for private libraries. In
practice, it is common for programmers to write code using private libraries.
However, this is a challenge for language models since they have never seen
private APIs during training. Motivated by the fact that private libraries
usually come with elaborate API documentation, we propose a novel framework
with two modules: the APIRetriever finds useful APIs, and then the APICoder
generates code using these APIs. For APIRetriever, we present a dense retrieval
system and also design a friendly interaction to involve uses. For APICoder, we
can directly use off-the-shelf language models, or continually pre-train the
base model on a code corpus containing API information. Both modules are
trained with data from public libraries and can be generalized to private ones.
Furthermore, we craft three benchmarks for private libraries, named
TorchDataEval, MonkeyEval, and BeatNumEval. Experimental results demonstrate
the impressive performance of our framework.

multiple modes are measured simultaneously from the same subject, has emerged
as an exciting modern approach enabled by recent engineering breakthroughs in

such data is to enable new discoveries of the underlying connectivity by
combining multimodal signals. Despite the scientific interest, there remains a
gap in principled statistical methods for estimating the graph underlying
multimodal functional data. To this end, we propose a new integrative framework
that models the data generation process and identifies operators mapping from
the observation space to the latent space. We then develop an estimator that
simultaneously estimates the transformation operators and the latent graph.
This estimator is based on the partial correlation operator, which we
rigorously extend from the multivariate to the functional setting. Our
procedure is provably efficient, with the estimator converging to a stationary
point with quantifiable statistical error. Furthermore, we show recovery of the
latent graph under mild conditions. Our work is applied to analyze
simultaneously acquired multimodal brain imaging data where the graph indicates
functional connectivity of the brain. We present simulation and empirical

ranker to select the most appropriate response among several candidates.
However, such selection models tend to rely on context-response content
similarity, which makes models vulnerable to adversarial responses that are
semantically similar but not relevant to the dialogue context. Recent studies
have shown that leveraging these adversarial responses as negative training
samples is useful for improving the discriminating power of the selection
model. Nevertheless, collecting human-written adversarial responses is
expensive, and existing synthesizing methods often have limited scalability. To
overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a simple but efficient method
for generating adversarial negative responses leveraging a large-scale language

outperforms other methods of synthesizing adversarial negative responses. These

that it is capable of generating radiation patterns for multiple applications

is generally much less than the Rayleigh distance. For a given AMAF aperture,
the optimal AMAF-RIS distance increases as a function of the RIS size. The
AMAF-RIS loss is compensated almost exactly by the larger aperture gain of the
RIS leading to almost constant RIS gain with increasing RIS sizes. This allows
to choose different beam angular selectivities with the same center beam gain.
Active RF amplification is done at the AMAF only, thus resulting in a much
higher power efficiency and much lower hardware complexity than conventional
phased arrays with same beamforming performance.

but its main feature is a searchable database of so called ""interesting""
graphs, which includes graphs that already occurred as extremal graphs or as
counterexamples to conjectures. An important aspect of this database is that it
can be extended by users of the website.
  Over the years, several new features and graph invariants were added to the
House of Graphs and users uploaded many interesting graphs to the website. But
as the development of the original House of Graphs website started in 2010, the
underlying frameworks and technologies of the website became outdated. This is
why we completely rebuilt the House of Graphs using modern frameworks to build
a maintainable and expandable web application that is future-proof. On top of
this, several new functionalities were added to improve the application and the

arbitrary Hamiltonian on a quantum computer or programmable quantum simulator.
The protocol is inspired by the adiabatic demagnetization technique, used to
cool solid-state systems to extremely low temperatures. A fraction of the
qubits (or spins) is used to model a spin bath that is coupled to the system.
By an adiabatic ramp down of a simulated Zeeman field acting on the bath spins,
energy and entropy are extracted from the system. The bath spins are then
measured and reset to the polarized state, and the process is repeated until
convergence to a low-energy steady state is achieved. We demonstrate the
protocol via application to the quantum Ising model. We study the protocol's
performance in the presence of noise and show how the information from the
measurement of the bath spins can be used to monitor the cooling process. The
performance of the algorithm depends on the nature of the excitations of the
system; systems with non-local (topological) excitations are more difficult to
cool than those with local excitations. We explore the possible mitigation of
this problem by trapping topological excitations.

minimize a multi-scale loss between the feature vectors produced by the teacher

sixth-generation (6G) networks owing to its ability to manipulate wireless
environments. As a frequency-selective device, RIS can only effectively shape
the propagation of signals within a certain frequency band. Due to this
frequency-selective property, the deployment of RIS in cellular networks will
introduce a complicated base station (BS)-RIS-user association issue since
adjacent BSs operate at different frequency bands. In this paper, with the
consideration of the frequency-selective characteristics of RIS, we aim to
jointly optimize BS-RIS-user association, active beamforming at BSs, and
passive beamforming of RIS to maximize the sum-rate of a RIS-assisted cellular
network. We first leverage $l_0$-norm to efficiently integrate BS-RIS-user
association with active and passive beamforming. Then, we adopt fractional
programming (FP) and block coordinate descent (BCD) methods to deal with
logarithmic and fractional parts and decouple the joint association and
beamforming design problem into several sub-problems. Efficient algorithms
which combine $l_0$-norm approximation, majorization-minimization (MM), and
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) are developed to alternately
solve the sub-problems. Extensive simulation results illustrate the importance
of BS-RIS-user association optimization in RIS-assisted cellular networks and
verify the effectiveness of the proposed joint association and beamforming
design algorithm.

delay on geometrical graphs that involves {\it global} delay parameter.
Differential operators on graphs model various processes in many areas of
science and technology. Although a vast majority of studies in this direction
concern purely differential operators on graphs (often referred to as quantum
graphs), recently there also appeared some considerations of nonlocal operators
on star-type graphs. In particular, there belong functional-differential
operators with constant delays but in a {\it locally} nonlocal version. The
latter means that each edge of the graph has its own delay parameter, which
does not affect any other edge. In this paper, we introduce {\it globally}
nonlocal operators that are expected to be more natural for modelling nonlocal
processes on graphs. We also extend this idea to arbitrary trees, which opens a
wide area of further research. Another goal of the paper is to study inverse
spectral problems for operators with global delay in one illustrative case by
addressing a wide range of questions including uniqueness, characterization of
the spectral data as well as the uniform stability.

Networks (GNNs) are still under exploration, presenting a stark disparity to
its broad edge adoptions such as traffic flow forecasting and location-based

optimization for distributed GNN processing over a multi-tier heterogeneous

variety of different cost factors, based on which we formulate a cost-efficient
graph layout optimization problem that is proved to be NP-hard. Instead of
trivially applying traditional data placement wisdom, we theoretically reveal
the structural property of quadratic submodularity implicated in GNN's unique
computing pattern, which motivates our design of an efficient iterative

parameterized constant approximation ratio, guaranteed convergence, and exact
feasibility. To tackle potential graph topological evolution in GNN processing,
we further devise an incremental update strategy and an adaptive scheduling

real-world datasets and various GNN benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
achieves superior performance over de facto baselines with more than 95.8% cost

LaO$X$/WS$_2$ is generally compatible with PMOS application. The presence of an

speaker TTS system that can synthesize accent speech. To this end, there are
two challenging problems to be solved. First, direct use of the poor acoustic
quality crowd-sourced data and the target speaker data in accent transfer will
apparently lead to synthetic speech with degraded quality. To mitigate this
problem, we take a bottleneck feature (BN) based TTS approach, in which TTS is
decomposed into a Text-to-BN (T2BN) module to learn accent and a BN-to-Mel
(BN2Mel) module to learn speaker timbre, where neural network based BN feature
serves as the intermediate representation that are robust to noise
interference. Second, direct training T2BN using the crowd-sourced data in the
two-stage system will produce accent speech of target speaker with poor
prosody. This is because the the crowd-sourced recordings are contributed from
the ordinary unprofessional speakers. To tackle this problem, we update the
two-stage approach to a novel three-stage approach, where T2BN and BN2Mel are
trained using the high-quality target speaker data and a new BN-to-BN module is
plugged in between the two modules to perform accent transfer. To train the
BN2BN module, the parallel unaccented and accented BN features are obtained by
a proposed data augmentation procedure. Finally the proposed three-stage
approach manages to produce accent speech for the target speaker with good
prosody, as the prosody pattern is inherited from the professional target
speaker and accent transfer is achieved by the BN2BN module at the same time.
The proposed approach, named as AccentSpeech, is validated in a Mandarin TTS
accent transfer task.

spaces of Morita equivalent SRFs are isomrophic as pseudo-metric spaces.
  In a second part, we introduce the category of $\mathcal{I}$-Poisson
manifolds. Its objects and morphisms generalize Poisson manifolds and morphisms
in the presence of appropriate ideals $\mathcal{I}$ of the smooth functions on
the manifold such that two conditions are satisfied: $(i)$ The category of
Poisson manifolds becomes a full subcategory when choosing $\mathcal{I}=0$ and
$(ii)$ there is a reduction functor from this new category to the category of
Poisson algebras, which generalizes coistropic reduction to the singular

  Every SF on $M$ gives rise to an $\mathcal{I}$-Poisson manifold on $T^*M$ and
$g$ enhances this to an SRF if and only if the induced Hamiltonian lies in the
normalizer of $\mathcal{I}$. This perspective provides, on the one hand, a
simple proof of the fact that every module SRF is a geometric SRF and, on the
other hand, a construction of an algebraic invariant of singular foliations:
Hausdorff Morita equivalent SFs have isomorphic reduced Poisson algebras.

core formation reduces the visible radius and the total mass pushing them below
observational limits while halo formation is in favor of the latest mass-radius
observations. Applying joint multi-messenger constraints for the radius and
maximum mass, we scan over parameter space of the bosonic DM model. It turns
out that the maximum mass limit provides a more stringent constraint compare to
the radius one. Our investigation allows for the exclusion of a large portion

be less than $\sim4\%$ for the mass range $m_{\chi}\gtrsim200$ MeV at the

Coloring and CD Coloring. In both problems, we are given a graph $G$ and a
natural number $\ell$ as input and the goal is to properly color the vertices
with at most $\ell$ colors with specific constraints. In Dominator Coloring, we
require for each $v \in V(G)$, a color $c$ such that $v$ dominates all vertices
colored $c$. In CD Coloring, we require for each color $c$, a $v \in V(G)$
which dominates all vertices colored $c$. These problems, defined due to their
applications in social and genetic networks, have been studied extensively in
the last 15 years. While it is known that both problems are fixed-parameter
tractable (FPT) when parameterized by $(t,\ell)$ where $t$ is the treewidth of
$G$, we consider strictly structural parameterizations which naturally arise
out of the problems' applications.
  We prove that Dominator Coloring is FPT when parameterized by the size of a
graph's cluster vertex deletion (CVD) set and that CD Coloring is FPT
parameterized by CVD set size plus the number of remaining cliques. En route,
we design a simpler and faster FPT algorithms when the problems are
parameterized by the size of a graph's twin cover, a special CVD set. When the
parameter is the size of a graph's clique modulator, we design a randomized
single-exponential time algorithm for the problems. These algorithms use an
inclusion-exclusion based polynomial sieving technique and add to the growing
number of applications using this powerful algebraic technique.

recently. With a large amount of image-text pairs, VLP models trained with

incoming data and retain learned knowledge. In this work, we focus on learning
a VLP model with sequential chunks of image-text pair data. To tackle the
catastrophic forgetting issue in this multi-modal continual learning setting,
we first introduce pseudo text replay that generates hard negative texts
conditioned on the training images in memory, which not only better preserves
learned knowledge but also improves the diversity of negative samples in the
contrastive loss. Moreover, we propose multi-modal knowledge distillation
between images and texts to align the instance-wise prediction between old and

compression techniques is limited by the scale and complexity of GPT models. In
this paper, we address this challenge, and propose GPTQ, a new one-shot weight
quantization method based on approximate second-order information, that is both
highly-accurate and highly-efficient. Specifically, GPTQ can quantize GPT
models with 175 billion parameters in approximately four GPU hours, reducing
the bitwidth down to 3 or 4 bits per weight, with negligible accuracy
degradation relative to the uncompressed baseline. Our method more than doubles
the compression gains relative to previously-proposed one-shot quantization

we also show that our method can still provide reasonable accuracy in the
extreme quantization regime, in which weights are quantized to 2-bit or even
ternary quantization levels. We show experimentally that these improvements can
be leveraged for end-to-end inference speedups over FP16, of around 3.25x when

disc galaxies with $\sim$10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ baryonic mass. The
magneto-hydrodynamical simulations are carried out with the PIERNIK code and
include star formation, feedback from supernova, and cosmic ray advection and
diffusion. We find that stream accretion enhances galactic star formation.
Lower angular momentum streams result in more compact discs, higher star
formation rates and stronger outflows. In agreement with previous studies,
models including cosmic rays launch stronger outflows travelling much further
into the galactic halo. Cosmic ray supported outflows are also cooler than
supernova only driven outflows. With cosmic rays, the star formation is
suppressed and the thermal pressure is reduced. We find evidence for two
distinct outflow phases. The warm outflows have high angular momentum and stay
close to the galactic disc, while the hot outflow phase has low angular
momentum and escapes from the centre deep into the halo. Cosmic rays can
therefore have a strong impact on galaxy evolution by removing low angular
momentum, possibly metal enriched gas from the disc and injecting it into the
circumgalactic medium.

recent model handles these unclosed terms using a multi-level version of the
recent deformation of Gaussian fields (RDGF) closure (Johnson \& Meneveau,
Phys.~Rev.~Fluids, 2017). This model is in remarkable agreement with DNS data
and works for arbitrary Taylor Reynolds numbers $\Rey_\lambda$. Inspired by
this, we develop a Lagrangian model for passive scalar gradients in isotropic

term in the Lagrangian frame, namely the scalar gradient diffusion term, which
we model using the RDGF approach. However, comparisons of the statistics
obtained from this model with direct numerical simulation (DNS) data reveal
substantial errors due to erroneously large fluctuations generated by the

an instance of an algorithmic problem, which is the most suitable algorithm to
solve it? As such, the AS problem has received considerable attention resulting
in various approaches - many of which either solve a regression or ranking
problem under the hood. Although both of these formulations yield very natural
ways to tackle AS, they have considerable weaknesses. On the one hand,
correctly predicting the performance of an algorithm on an instance is a
sufficient, but not a necessary condition to produce a correct ranking over
algorithms and in particular ranking the best algorithm first. On the other
hand, classical ranking approaches often do not account for concrete
performance values available in the training data, but only leverage rankings
composed from such data. We propose HARRIS- Hybrid rAnking and RegRessIon
foreSts - a new algorithm selector leveraging special forests, combining the
strengths of both approaches while alleviating their weaknesses. HARRIS'
decisions are based on a forest model, whose trees are created based on splits
optimized on a hybrid ranking and regression loss function. As our preliminary
experimental study on ASLib shows, HARRIS improves over standard algorithm
selection approaches on some scenarios showing that combining ranking and
regression in trees is indeed promising for AS.

at an unknown point in time and the duration of a change is substantially
finite, in which case one says that the change is intermittent or transient. We
provide an overview of existing approaches for intermittent change detection

of the change. We propose a novel optimization criterion that is more
appropriate for many applied areas such as the detection of threats in
physical-computer systems, near-Earth space informatics, epidemiology,
pharmacokinetics, etc. We argue that controlling the local conditional
probability of a false alarm, rather than the familiar average run length to a
false alarm, and maximizing the local conditional probability of detection is a
more reasonable approach versus a traditional quickest change detection
approach that requires minimizing the expected delay to detection. We adopt the
maximum likelihood (ML) approach with respect to the change duration and show
that several commonly used detection rules (CUSUM, window-limited CUSUM, and
FMA) are equivalent to the ML-based stopping times. We discuss how to choose
design parameters for these rules and provide a comprehensive simulation study
to corroborate intuitive expectations.

both the mean and the variance of the signal can change, is often a challenging
task. A key difficulty in this context often involves setting an appropriate
detection threshold, which for many standard change statistics may need to be
tuned depending on the pre-change and post-change distributions. This presents
a challenge in a sequential change detection setting when a signal switches
between multiple distributions. For example, consider a signal where change
points are indicated by increases/decreases in the mean and variance of the
signal. In this context, we would like to be able to compare our change
statistic to a fixed threshold that will be symmetric to either increases or
decreases in the mean and variance. Unfortunately, change point detection
schemes that use the log-likelihood ratio, such as CUSUM and GLR, are quick to
react to changes but are not symmetric when both the mean and the variance of
the signal change. This makes it difficult to set a single threshold to detect
multiple change points sequentially in a streaming setting. We propose a
modified version of CUSUM that we call Data-Adaptive Symmetric CUSUM
(DAS-CUSUM). The DAS-CUSUM change point detection procedure is symmetric for
changes between distributions, making it suitable to set a single threshold to
detect multiple change points sequentially in a streaming setting. We provide
results that relate to the expected detection delay and average run length for
our proposed procedure. Extensive simulations are used to validate these
results. Experiments on real-world data further show the utility of using
DAS-CUSUM over both CUSUM and GLR.

significant practical adoption. Despite this progress, almost all known
compression schemes apply compression uniformly across DNN layers, although
layers are heterogeneous in terms of parameter count and their impact on model
accuracy. In this work, we provide a general framework for adapting the degree
of compression across the model's layers dynamically during training,
significantly improving the overall compression without sacrificing accuracy.
Our framework, called L-GreCo, is based on an efficient adaptive algorithm,
which automatically picks the optimal compression parameters for model layers
guaranteeing the best compression ratio while respecting a
theoretically-justified error constraint. Our extensive experimental study over
image classification and language modeling tasks shows that L-GreCo is
effective across all three compression families, and achieves up to 2.5$\times$
training speedup and up to 5$\times$ compression improvement over efficient
implementations of standard approaches while recovering full accuracy.
Moreover, we show that L-GreCo is complementary to existing adaptive algorithms
improving their compression ratio by 50% and practical throughput by 66%.

applications for subsampling datasets. They are however held back in some cases
by the high cost of sampling. In the worst-case scenario, the sampling cost
scales as O(n^3) where n is the number of elements of the ground set. A popular
workaround to this prohibitive cost is to sample DPPs defined by low-rank
kernels. In such cases, the cost of standard sampling algorithms scales as
O(np^2 + nm^2) where m is the (average) number of samples of the DPP (usually m
<< n) and p the rank of the kernel used to define the DPP (m \leq p \leq n).
The first term, O(np^2), comes from a SVD-like step. We focus here on the
second term of this cost, O(nm^2), and show that it can be brought down to O(nm
+ m^3 log m) without loss on the sampling's exactness. In practice, we observe
very substantial speedups compared to the classical algorithm as soon as n >
1000. The algorithm described here is a close variant of the standard algorithm
for sampling continuous DPPs, and uses rejection sampling. In the specific case
of projection DPPs, we also show that any additional sample can be drawn in
time O(m^3 log m). Finally, an interesting by-product of the analysis is that a
realisation from a DPP is typically contained in a subset of size O(m log m)

semi-automated annotation of thousands of SMs in IMC images of patient muscle
biopsies. In this paper we investigate the use of deep learning (DL) on raw IMC

vision DL models on all available image channels, both combined and
individually. We observed better than expected accuracy for many of these

computer vision DL to find the basis of the predictions of these models. Some
of the resulting visual explainable maps highlight features in the images that
appear consistent with the latest hypotheses about mitochondrial disease

Hydrodynamics simulations of the engulfment of a BD with masses 0.01 and 0.019
Msun, onto an MS star of 1 Msun and solar composition, in three different
scenarios: a head-on collision, a grazing collision, and a merger. We study the

interaction and the mass of the BD on the final fate of the sub-stellar object
and the host star in terms of mass loss of the system, angular momentum
transfer, and changes in the Li abundance in the surface of the host star. We
found that most of the BD mass is diluted in the denser region of the MS star.
Only in the merger scenario a significant fraction (40%) of the BD material
would remain in the outer layers. We find a clear increase in the surface
rotational velocity of the host star after the interaction, ranging between 25
km/s (grazing collision) to 50 km/s (merger). We also find a significant mass
loss from the system (1e-4 - 1e-3 Msun) due to the engulfment, which in the
case of the merger, may form a circumstellar disk-like structure. Assuming that
neither the depth of the convective envelope of the host star nor its mass
content are modified during the interaction, a small change in the surface Li
abundance in the head-on and grazing collisions is found. However, in the
merger we find large Li enhancements, by factors 20-30, depending on the BD
mass. Some of these features could be detected observationally in the host star
provide they remain long enough time.

has been applied to reinforcement learning such that the knowledge gained in
one task can be applied when training in a new task. Curriculum learning is
concerned with sequencing tasks or data samples such that knowledge can be

learning setting where we simultaneously train a teacher that selects tasks for
the student while the student learns how to solve the selected task. Our method
is independent of human domain knowledge and manual curriculum design. We
evaluated our methods on two reinforcement learning benchmarks: grid world and

memory level. Intel recently introduced the eADR feature that guarantees to
flush data buffered in CPU cache to pmem on a power outage, thereby making the
CPU cache a transient persistence domain. Researchers have explored how to
enable the atomic durability for applications' in-pmem data. In this paper, we
exploit the eADR-supported CPU cache to do so. A modified cache line, until
written back to pmem, is a natural redo log copy of the in-pmem data. However,
a write-back due to cache replacement or eADR on a crash overwrites the
original copy. We accordingly develop Hercules, a hardware logging design for
the transaction-level atomic durability, with supportive components installed
in CPU cache, memory controller (MC), and pmem. When a transaction commits,
Hercules commits on-chip its data staying in cache lines. For cache lines
evicted before the commit, Hercules asks the MC to redirect and persist them
into in-pmem log entries and commits them off-chip upon committing the
transaction. Hercules lazily conducts pmem writes only for cache replacements
at runtime. On a crash, Hercules saves metadata and data for active
transactions into pmem for recovery. Experiments show that, by using CPU cache
for both buffering and logging, Hercules yields much higher throughput and
incurs significantly fewer pmem writes than state-of-the-art designs.

information can be sensed by vehicles and uploaded to the edge node via
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. The digital twins are modeled
based on the sensed information, which are utilized to from the logical view to
reflect the real-time status of the physical vehicular environment. Second, we
derive the cooperative sensing model and the V2I uploading model by considering
the timeliness and consistency of digital twins, and the redundancy, sensing
cost, and transmission cost. On this basis, a bi-objective problem is
formulated to maximize the system quality and minimize the system cost. Third,
we propose a solution based on multi-agent multi-objective (MAMO) deep
reinforcement learning, where a dueling critic network is proposed to evaluate
the agent action based on the value of state and the advantage of action.

subsurface heterogeneity and geologic complexity in combination with lack of
measurements/unreliable measurements. This uncertainty affects the accuracy and
reliability of model outputs. Therefore, parameters' uncertainty must be
quantified before adopting the model as an engineering tool. In this study, we
model the uncertain parameters as random variables and use a Bayesian inversion
approach to obtain a posterior,data-informed, probability density function

move to real well data (coming from the Ticino River basin, in northern Italy,

hundred meters per second. Previous studies on zonal gravitational harmonics
and Ohmic dissipation constraints suggest that the wind speeds diminish rapidly
in relatively shallow depths within the planets. Through a case-by-case
comparison between the missing dynamical gravitational harmonic $J^\prime_4$
from structure models, and with that expected from fluid perturbations, we put
constraints on zonal wind decay in Uranus and Neptune. To this end, we generate
polytropic empirical structure models of Uranus and Neptune using $4^{\rm
th}$-order Theory of Figures (ToF) that leave hydrostatic $J_4$ as an open
parameter. Allotting the missing dynamical contribution to density
perturbations caused by zonal winds (and their dynamic self-gravity), we find
that the maximum scale height of zonal winds are $\sim 2-3\%$ of the planetary
radii for both planets. Allowing the models to have $J_2$ solutions in the $\pm
5 \times 10^{-6}$ range around the observed value has similar implications. The
effect of self-gravity on $J^\prime_4$ is roughly a factor of ten lower than
that of zonal winds, as expected. The decay scale heights are virtually
insensitive to the proposed modifications to the bulk rotation periods of
Uranus and Neptune in the literature. Additionally, we find that the dynamical
density perturbations due to zonal winds have a measurable impact on the shape
of the planet, and could potentially be used to infer wind decay and bulk
rotation period via future observations.

identify nondipole effects in triple ionization of Ne driven by infrared laser
pulses at intensities where electron-electron correlation prevails. This model
fully accounts for the Coulomb interaction of each electron with the core and
avoids artificial autoionization by employing effective Coulomb potentials to
describe the interaction between bound electrons (ECBB). Using the ECBB model,
we identify a prominent signature of nondipole effects. Namely, the component
along the direction of light propagation of the average sum of the final
electron momenta is large and positive. That is, we identify a positive
momentum offset, absent in the dipole approximation. We find that this positive
momentum offset stems mostly from the momentum change due to the magnetic
field. To further understand this momentum change, we also develop a simple
model for the motion of an electron inside an electromagnetic field. This
simple model accounts for the effect of the Coulomb forces only as a sharp
change in the momentum of the electron during recollision. We show that the
momentum change due to the magnetic field is related with the sharp change in
momentum during recollision for the recolliding electron as well as with the
time of recollision for both the recolliding and bound electrons. Hence, we
demonstrate that the final electron momentum offset probes the strength of a
recollision and hence the degree of correlation in multielectron ionization.

natural language processing tasks. However, performance metrics such as
accuracy do not measure the quality of the model in terms of its ability to
robustly represent complex linguistic structures. In this paper, focusing on
the ability of language models to represent syntax, we propose a framework to
assess the consistency and robustness of linguistic representations. To this
end, we introduce measures of robustness of neural network models that leverage
recent advances in extracting linguistic constructs from LLMs via probing
tasks, i.e., simple tasks used to extract meaningful information about a single
facet of a language model, such as syntax reconstruction and root
identification. Empirically, we study the performance of four LLMs across six
different corpora on the proposed robustness measures by analysing their
performance and robustness with respect to syntax-preserving perturbations. We
provide evidence that context-free representation (e.g., GloVe) are in some
cases competitive with context-dependent representations from modern LLMs
(e.g., BERT), yet equally brittle to syntax-preserving perturbations. Our key
observation is that emergent syntactic representations in neural networks are
brittle. We make the code, trained models and logs available to the community
as a contribution to the debate about the capabilities of LLMs.

has shown that circuit advancement has a significant effect on the enhancement
of energy harvesting capability in resonance. On the other hand, some recent
studies using the phase-variable (PV) synchronized switch technologies have
found that the advanced circuit solutions can also broaden the harvesting
bandwidth. However, the available span of the electrically induced dynamics by
the existing energy harvesting circuits was not properly defined and
demonstrated. Performance comparison among different circuits cannot be fairly
achieved without using a common theoretical language. Given these, this paper
provides an impedance-based analysis and comparison on the electromechanical
joint dynamics of the PEH systems using different interface circuits. Given
that the resonance tunability by circuit solutions has received no attention in
the conventional ideal model of kinetic energy harvester, we firstly propose a
more inclusive ideal model for better generalization. In practice, it was
proven that the attainable dynamic ranges of the practical energy harvesting
circuits are only some subsets of the ideal realm. A detailed quantitative
study on the attainable ranges of the PV circuit solutions is provided after
the introduction of the ideal target. Simulation and experimental results of
different interface circuits show good agreement with the theoretical analysis.
It can be concluded that the resonance tunability strongly depends on the
achievable extent in the reactive direction of the equivalent impedance plane.
In practice, the electromechanical coupling conditions and dielectric loss
might also influence the resonance tunability. The general ideal model and
quantitative impedance analysis provided in this paper help guide the future
design effort towards high-capability and broadband PEH systems.

matches frames between two sequences under a varying degree of time warping, to
account for varying temporal intra-class dynamics of actions. However, as DTW
is the smallest distance among all paths, it may be affected by the feature
uncertainty which varies across time steps/frames. Thus, in this paper, we
propose to model the so-called aleatoric uncertainty of a differentiable (soft)
version of DTW. To this end, we model the heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty
of each path by the product of likelihoods from Normal distributions, each
capturing variance of pair of frames. (The path distance is the sum of base
distances between features of pairs of frames of the path.) The Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) applied to a path yields two terms: (i) a sum of
Euclidean distances weighted by the variance inverse, and (ii) a sum of
log-variance regularization terms. Thus, our uncertainty-DTW is the smallest
weighted path distance among all paths, and the regularization term (penalty
for the high uncertainty) is the aggregate of log-variances along the path. The
distance and the regularization term can be used in various objectives. We
showcase forecasting the evolution of time series, estimating the Fr\'echet

a small constant times (T/2 - t), where T is the number of frames and t is the

that are fed into the two dimensional transducer recursion. For both streaming
Conformer models and unidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) models,
experimental results show that it can significantly reduce the symbol delay

in automatic speech recognition (ASR), where a student model is trained to
imitate the output behaviour of a teacher model. However, traditional KD
methods suffer from teacher label storage issue, especially when the training
corpora are large. Although on-the-fly teacher label generation tackles this
issue, the training speed is significantly slower as the teacher model has to
be evaluated every batch. In this paper, we reformulate the generation of
teacher label as a codec problem. We propose a novel Multi-codebook Vector
Quantization (MVQ) approach that compresses teacher embeddings to codebook
indexes (CI). Based on this, a KD training framework (MVQ-KD) is proposed where
a student model predicts the CI generated from the embeddings of a
self-supervised pre-trained teacher model. Experiments on the LibriSpeech
clean-100 hour show that MVQ-KD framework achieves comparable performance as
traditional KD methods (l1, l2), while requiring 256 times less storage. When
the full LibriSpeech dataset is used, MVQ-KD framework results in 13.8% and
8.2% relative word error rate reductions (WERRs) for non -streaming transducer
on test-clean and test-other and 4.0% and 4.9% for streaming transducer. The
implementation of this work is already released as a part of the open-source

their operational lifetime. Even if the deterioration evolution of structural
elements can be estimated through physics-based deterioration models, the
uncertainties involved in the process hurdle the selection of lifecycle
management decisions. In this scenario, the collection of relevant information
through an efficient monitoring system enables the reduction of uncertainties,
ultimately driving more optimal lifecycle decisions. However, a full monitoring
instrumentation implemented on all wind turbines in a farm might become
unfeasible due to practical and economical constraints. Besides, certain load
monitoring systems often become defective after a few years of marine
environment exposure. Addressing the aforementioned concerns, a farm-wide
virtual load monitoring scheme directed by a fleet-leader wind turbine offers
an attractive solution. Fetched with data retrieved from a fully-instrumented
wind turbine, a model can be trained and then deployed, thus yielding load
predictions of non-fully monitored wind turbines, from which only standard data
remains available. In this paper, we propose a virtual load monitoring
framework formulated via Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and we provide
relevant implementation details needed for the construction, training, and
deployment of BNN data-based virtual monitoring models. As opposed to their
deterministic counterparts, BNNs intrinsically announce the uncertainties
associated with generated load predictions and allow to detect inaccurate load
estimations generated for non-fully monitored wind turbines. The proposed
virtual load monitoring is thoroughly tested through an experimental campaign
in an operational offshore wind farm and the results demonstrate the
effectiveness of BNN models for fleet-leader-based farm-wide virtual

popular item embeddings is closer to that of positive interactions, and (ii)
the magnitude of positive gradient for popular items are much greater than that
of unpopular items. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet efficient
framework to mitigate popularity bias from a gradient perspective.
Specifically, we first normalize each user embedding and record accumulated
gradients of users and items via popularity bias measures in model training. To
address the popularity bias issues, we develop a gradient-based embedding
adjustment approach used in model testing. This strategy is generic,
model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing recommender

four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over

However, selecting the participants that would contribute to this collaborative

entail substantial problems due to the heterogeneity in terms of data quality,
and computational and communication resources across the participants. Although
several approaches have been proposed in the literature to overcome the problem
of random selection, most of these approaches follow a unilateral selection
strategy. In fact, they base their selection strategy on only the federated
server's side, while overlooking the interests of the client devices in the
process. To overcome this problem, we present in this paper FedMint, an
intelligent client selection approach for federated learning on IoT devices
using game theory and bootstrapping mechanism. Our solution involves the design
of: (1) preference functions for the client IoT devices and federated servers
to allow them to rank each other according to several factors such as accuracy
and price, (2) intelligent matching algorithms that take into account the
preferences of both parties in their design, and (3) bootstrapping technique
that capitalizes on the collaboration of multiple federated servers in order to
assign initial accuracy value for the newly connected IoT devices. Based on our
simulation findings, our strategy surpasses the VanillaFL selection approach in
terms of maximizing both the revenues of the client devices and accuracy of the

  human-AI military teams","5 pages, under review for a special edition Responsible AI in
  Military Applications of Ethics and Information Technology, Springer",,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A Nation's responsibility is to predict in advance and protect human
wellbeing in conflict including protection from moral injury and unjust
attribution of responsibility for their actions. This position paper considers
responsibility for unlawful killings by human AI teams drawing on a metaphor
from Neta Crawford's chapter, When Soldiers Snap: Bad Apples and Mad Apples, in
Accountability for Killing: Moral responsibility for collateral damage in
America's post 911 wars. This paper contends that although militaries may have
some bad apples responsible for war crimes and some mad apples unable to be
responsible for their actions during a conflict, increasingly militaries may
cook their good apples by putting them in untenable decision making
environments with AI. A cooked apple may be pushed beyond reasonable limits
leading to a loss of situational awareness, cognitive overload, loss of agency
and autonomy leading to automation bias. In these cases, moral responsibility
and perhaps even legal responsibility for unlawful deaths may be contested for
cooked apples, risking operators becoming moral crumple zones and or suffering
moral injury from being part of larger human AI systems authorised by the
state. Nations are responsible for minimising risks to humans within reasonable
bounds and compliance with legal obligations in human AI military teams, and
the military systems used to make or implement decisions. The paper suggests
that best practise WHS frameworks might be drawn on in development, acquisition
and training ahead of deployment of systems in conflicts to predict and
mitigate risks of human AI military teams.

  Theoretic Perspective",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Attention mechanisms have recently demonstrated impressive performance on a
range of NLP tasks, and attention scores are often used as a proxy for model
explainability. However, there is a debate on whether attention weights can, in
fact, be used to identify the most important inputs to a model. We approach
this question from an information theoretic perspective by measuring the mutual
information between the model output and the hidden states. From extensive
experiments, we draw the following conclusions: (i) Additive and Deep attention
mechanisms are likely to be better at preserving the information between the
hidden states and the model output (compared to Scaled Dot-product); (ii)
ablation studies indicate that Additive attention can actively learn to explain
the importance of its input hidden representations; (iii) when attention values
are nearly the same, the rank order of attention values is not consistent with
the rank order of the mutual information(iv) Using Gumbel-Softmax with a
temperature lower than one, tends to produce a more skewed attention score
distribution compared to softmax and hence is a better choice for explainable
design; (v) some building blocks are better at preserving the correlation
between the ordered list of mutual information and attention weights order (for
e.g., the combination of BiLSTM encoder and Additive attention). Our findings
indicate that attention mechanisms do have the potential to function as a
shortcut to model explanations when they are carefully combined with other
model elements.

  L\'evy process and its two extrema",,,,,"q-fin.CP math.PR q-fin.MF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the paper, we develop a very fast and accurate method for pricing double
barrier options with continuous monitoring in wide classes of L\'evy models;
the calculations are in the dual space, and the Wiener-Hopf factorization is
used. For wide regions in the parameter space, the precision of the order of
$10^{-15}$ is achievable in seconds, and of the order of $10^{-9}-10^{-8}$ - in
fractions of a second. The Wiener-Hopf factors and repeated integrals in the
pricing formulas are calculated using sinh-deformations of the lines of
integration, the corresponding changes of variables and the simplified
trapezoid rule. If the Bromwich integral is calculated using the Gaver-Wynn Rho
acceleration instead of the sinh-acceleration, the CPU time is typically
smaller but the precision is of the order of $10^{-9}-10^{-6}$, at best.
Explicit pricing algorithms and numerical examples are for no-touch options,
digitals (equivalently, for the joint distribution function of a L\'evy process
and its supremum and infimum processes), and call options. Several graphs are
produced to explain fundamental difficulties for accurate pricing of barrier
options using time discretization and interpolation-based calculations in the
state space.

jump-started quantum mechanics. His disenchantment with the Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum mechanics led him to unveil the Schr\""odinger's cat
paradox, which did not get much attention for nearly half a century. In the
meantime, disappointment with quantum mechanics turned his interest to biology
facilitating, albeit in a peripheral way, the revelation of the structure of
DNA. Interest in Schr\""odinger's cat has recently come roaring back making its
appearance conspicuously in numerous scientific articles. From the arguments
presented here, it would appear that the legendary Schr\""odinger's cat is here
to stay, symbolizing a profound truth that quantum reality exists at all
scales; but we do not observe it in our daily macroscopic world as it is masked
for all practical purposes, most likely by environmental decoherence with
irreversible thermal effects.

address the privacy concerns of using machine learning in privacy-sensitive
firms. However, the standards of the available frameworks can no longer sustain
the rapid advancement and hinder the integration of FL solutions, which can be
prominent in advancing the field. In this paper, we propose ModularFed, a
research-focused framework that addresses the complexity of FL implementations
and the lack of adaptability and extendability in the available frameworks. We
provide a comprehensive architecture that assists FL approaches through
well-defined protocols to cover three dominant FL paradigms: adaptable
workflow, datasets distribution, and third-party application support. Within
this architecture, protocols are blueprints that strictly define the
framework's components' design, contribute to its flexibility, and strengthen
its infrastructure. Further, our protocols aim to enable modularity in FL,
supporting third-party plug-and-play architecture and dynamic simulators
coupled with major built-in data distributors in the field. Additionally, the
framework support wrapping multiple approaches in a single environment to
enable consistent replication of FL issues such as clients' deficiency, data
distribution, and network latency, which entails a fair comparison of
techniques outlying FL technologies. In our evaluation, we examine the
applicability of our framework addressing three major FL domains, including
statistical distribution and modular-based approaches for resource monitoring
and client selection.
