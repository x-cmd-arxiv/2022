  Mimicry",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern smart TVs often communicate with their remote controls (including
those smart phone simulated ones) using multiple wireless channels (e.g.,
Infrared, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi). However, this multi-channel remote control
communication introduces a new attack surface. An inherent security flaw is
that remote controls of most smart TVs are designed to work in a benign
environment rather than an adversarial one, and thus wireless communications
between a smart TV and its remote controls are not strongly protected.
Attackers could leverage such flaw to abuse the remote control communication
and compromise smart TV systems. In this paper, we propose EvilScreen, a novel
attack that exploits ill-protected remote control communications to access
protected resources of a smart TV or even control the screen. EvilScreen
exploits a multi-channel remote control mimicry vulnerability present in today
smart TVs. Unlike other attacks, which compromise the TV system by exploiting
code vulnerabilities or malicious third-party apps, EvilScreen directly reuses
commands of different remote controls, combines them together to circumvent
deployed authentication and isolation policies, and finally accesses or
controls TV resources remotely. We evaluated eight mainstream smart TVs and
found that they are all vulnerable to EvilScreen attacks, including a Samsung
product adopting the ISO/IEC security specification.

Western, Russian, and Chinese media ecosystems with propaganda, disinformation,
and narrative spins present in all three. By utilizing the normalized pointwise
mutual information metric, differential sentiment analysis, word2vec models,
and partially labeled Dirichlet allocation, we present a quantitative analysis
of the differences in coverage amongst these three news ecosystems. We find
that while the Western press outlets have focused on the military and
humanitarian aspects of the war, Russian media have focused on the purported
justifications for the ""special military operation"" such as the presence in
Ukraine of ""bio-weapons"" and ""neo-nazis"", and Chinese news media have
concentrated on the conflict's diplomatic and economic consequences. Detecting
the presence of several Russian disinformation narratives in the articles of
several Chinese outlets, we finally measure the degree to which Russian media
has influenced Chinese coverage across Chinese outlets' news articles, Weibo
accounts, and Twitter accounts. Our analysis indicates that since the Russian
invasion of Ukraine, Chinese state media outlets have increasingly cited
Russian outlets as news sources and spread Russian disinformation narratives.

in fact finer-grained than existing corpus filtering methods and more accurate

specifies a probability distribution over possible worlds (i.e., sets of

so that one often looks for the most probable world as well as for the worlds

structure. In particular, the chain of inferences required for a specific
prediction (represented by a query) is not shown. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach where explanations are represented as programs that are
generated from a given query by a number of unfolding-like transformations.
Here, the chain of inferences that proves a given query is made explicit.
Furthermore, the generated explanations are minimal (i.e., contain no
irrelevant information) and can be parameterized w.r.t. a specification of
visible predicates, so that the user may hide uninteresting details from
explanations.

be more physical in the sense that the infamous sum rules are better satisfied
by the theory. We furthermore illustrate the importance of the plasmon

$\mathbb R^3$ which is defined as the Chekanov-Eliashberg dg-algebra of the
unit conormal Legendrian in the unit cotangent bundle of $\mathbb R^3$ with
homology coefficients. The purpose of this paper is to extend this definition
to an ambient isotopy invariant of tangles of any dimension and prove that
gluing of tangles gives a gluing formula for knot contact homology. The gluing
formula follows from a gluing formula for the Chekanov-Eliashberg dg-algebra

of a sequence of global-shutter (GS) images captured by a (virtual) moving GS
camera within the exposure duration. Although RS cameras are widely used, the
RS effect causes obvious image distortion especially in the presence of fast
camera motion, hindering downstream computer vision tasks. In this paper, we
propose to invert the RS image capture mechanism, i.e., recovering a continuous
high framerate GS video from two time-consecutive RS frames. We call this task
the RS temporal super-resolution (RSSR) problem. The RSSR is a very challenging
task, and to our knowledge, no practical solution exists to date. This paper
presents a novel deep-learning based solution. By leveraging the multi-view
geometry relationship of the RS imaging process, our learning-based framework
successfully achieves high framerate GS generation. Specifically, three novel
contributions can be identified: (i) novel formulations for bidirectional RS
undistortion flows under constant velocity as well as constant acceleration
motion model. (ii) a simple linear scaling operation, which bridges the RS
undistortion flow and regular optical flow. (iii) a new mutual conversion
scheme between varying RS undistortion flows that correspond to different
scanlines. Our method also exploits the underlying spatial-temporal geometric
relationships within a deep learning framework, where no additional supervision
is required beyond the necessary middle-scanline GS image. Building upon these
contributions, we represent the very first rolling-shutter temporal
super-resolution deep-network that is able to recover high framerate GS videos
from just two RS frames. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and
real data show that our proposed method can produce high-quality GS image
sequences with rich details, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

networks, thus motivating the search for sparser networks that can still be
trained to the same accuracy as the full network (i.e. matching). Iterative
magnitude pruning (IMP) is a state of the art algorithm that can find such
highly sparse matching subnetworks, known as winning tickets. IMP operates by
iterative cycles of training, masking smallest magnitude weights, rewinding
back to an early training point, and repeating. Despite its simplicity, the
underlying principles for when and how IMP finds winning tickets remain
elusive. In particular, what useful information does an IMP mask found at the
end of training convey to a rewound network near the beginning of training? How
does SGD allow the network to extract this information? And why is iterative
pruning needed? We develop answers in terms of the geometry of the error
landscape. First, we find that$\unicode{x2014}$at higher
sparsities$\unicode{x2014}$pairs of pruned networks at successive pruning
iterations are connected by a linear path with zero error barrier if and only
if they are matching. This indicates that masks found at the end of training
convey the identity of an axial subspace that intersects a desired linearly
connected mode of a matching sublevel set. Second, we show SGD can exploit this
information due to a strong form of robustness: it can return to this mode
despite strong perturbations early in training. Third, we show how the flatness
of the error landscape at the end of training determines a limit on the
fraction of weights that can be pruned at each iteration of IMP. Finally, we
show that the role of retraining in IMP is to find a network with new small
weights to prune. Overall, these results make progress toward demystifying the
existence of winning tickets by revealing the fundamental role of error
landscape geometry.

machine learning, the statistical adequacy of these methods is rarely
discussed. From a statistical perspective, a major distinction is between
analyzing a variable's importance before and after adjusting for covariates -
i.e., between $\textit{marginal}$ and $\textit{conditional}$ measures. Our work
draws attention to this rarely acknowledged, yet crucial distinction and
showcases its implications. Further, we reveal that for testing conditional FI,
only few methods are available and practitioners have hitherto been severely
restricted in method application due to mismatching data requirements. Most
real-world data exhibits complex feature dependencies and incorporates both
continuous and categorical data (mixed data). Both properties are oftentimes
neglected by conditional FI measures. To fill this gap, we propose to combine
the conditional predictive impact (CPI) framework with sequential knockoff
sampling. The CPI enables conditional FI measurement that controls for any
feature dependencies by sampling valid knockoffs - hence, generating synthetic
data with similar statistical properties - for the data to be analyzed.
Sequential knockoffs were deliberately designed to handle mixed data and thus
allow us to extend the CPI approach to such datasets. We demonstrate through
numerous simulations and a real-world example that our proposed workflow
controls type I error, achieves high power and is in line with results given by
other conditional FI measures, whereas marginal FI metrics result in misleading
interpretations. Our findings highlight the necessity of developing
statistically adequate, specialized methods for mixed data.

quickly become prohibitively expensive, as they scale exponentially as O(3^N)
for N-qubit states, using full state tomography with measurements in all Pauli
bases combinations.
  However, it is known [Somma et.al. 2006] that the complexity can be
drastically reduced when looking at fidelity lower bounds for states that
exhibit symmetries, such as Dicke States and GHZ States. For larger states,
these bounds have so far not been tight enough to provide reasonable
estimations on today's (2022) NISQ devices. In this work, for the first time
and more than 15 years after the theoretical introduction, we report meaningful
lower bounds for the state preparation fidelity of all Dicke States up to N=10
and all GHZ states up to N=20 on Quantinuum H1 ion-trap systems using efficient

  For example, we give state preparation fidelity lower bounds of (i) 0.46 for

exceed exact fidelity records recently achieved on superconducting systems for
the much smaller states |D6,3> and |G5>, respectively. Furthermore, we provide
evidence that for large Dicke States |DN,N/2>, we can resort to a GHZ-based
approximate state preparation to achieve better fidelity.

received a fairly high probability in pre-training. We hypothesize that the
large action space is a main obstacle to RL's effectiveness in MT, and conduct
two sets of experiments that lend support to our hypothesis. First, we find
that reducing the size of the vocabulary improves RL's effectiveness. Second,
we find that effectively reducing the dimension of the action space without
changing the vocabulary also yields notable improvement as evaluated by BLEU,
semantic similarity, and human evaluation. Indeed, by initializing the
network's final fully connected layer (that maps the network's internal
dimension to the vocabulary dimension), with a layer that generalizes over
similar actions, we obtain a substantial improvement in RL performance: 1.5
BLEU points on average.

neighbors can be tuned to favor either the neutral party or two oppositely
polarized parties, and can be disrupted by social agitation mimicked as
temperature. We study the equilibrium phase diagram and the non-equilibrium
stochastic dynamics of the model with various analytical approaches and with
Monte Carlo simulations on different substrates: the fully-connected (FC)
graph, the one-dimensional (1D) chain, and Erd\""os-R\'enyi (ER) random graphs.
We show that, in the mean-field approximation, the phase boundary between the
disordered and polarized phases is characterized by a tricritical point. On the
FC graph, in the absence of social agitation, kinetic barriers prevent the
system from reaching optimal consensus. On the 1D chain, the main result is
that the dynamics is governed by the growth of opinion clusters. Finally, for
the ER ensemble a phase transition analogous to that of the FC graph takes
place, but now the system is able to reach optimal consensus at low
temperatures, except when the average connectivity is low, in which case
dynamical traps arise from local frozen configurations.

states was introduced as a way to permit asynchronous execution in
multiprocessor systems. A key property of such problems is that the predicate
induces one lattice in the state space which guarantees that the execution is
correct even if nodes execute with old information about their neighbours.
Unfortunately, many interesting problems do not exhibit lattice linearity. This
issue was alleviated with the introduction of eventually lattice linear
algorithms. Such algorithms induce a partial order in a subset of the state
space even though the problem cannot be defined by a predicate under which the
states form a partial order.
  This paper focuses on analyzing and differentiating between lattice linear
problems and algorithms. It also introduces a new class of algorithms called
fully lattice linear algorithms. These algorithms partition the entire
reachable state space into one or more lattices and the initial state locks
into one of these lattices. Thus, under a few additional constraints, the
initial state can uniquely determine the final state. For demonstration, we
present lattice linear self-stabilizing algorithms for minimal dominating set
and graph colouring problems, and a parallel processing lattice linear
2-approximation algorithm for vertex cover.
  The algorithm for minimal dominating set converges in $n$ moves, and that for
graph colouring converges in $n+2m$ moves. These algorithms preserve this time
complexity while allowing the nodes to execute asynchronously and take actions
based on old or inconsistent information about their neighbours. They present
an improvement to the existing algorithms present in the literature. The
algorithm for vertex cover is the first lattice linear approximation algorithm
for an NP-Hard problem; it converges in $n$ moves.

whenever $|E|\geq Cq^{d-\frac{1}{d-1}}$ for $d\geq 3$, the VC-dimension of
$\Hh_t^d(E)$ is equal to that of $\Hh_t^d(\F_q^d)$. For the case of $d=3$, we
get a slightly stronger result: this result holds as long as $|E|\geq

non-uniform particle distributions, which usually happen in smoke, dust and
fog. Dealing with these dense and/or non-uniform distributions can be
intractable, since fog's attenuation and airlight (or veiling effect)
significantly weaken the background scene information in the input image. To
address this problem, we introduce a structure-representation network with
uncertainty feedback learning. Specifically, we extract the feature
representations from a pre-trained Vision Transformer (DINO-ViT) module to
recover the background information. To guide our network to focus on
non-uniform fog areas, and then remove the fog accordingly, we introduce the
uncertainty feedback learning, which produces the uncertainty maps, that have
higher uncertainty in denser fog regions, and can be regarded as an attention
map that represents fog's density and uneven distribution. Based on the
uncertainty map, our feedback network refines our defogged output iteratively.
Moreover, to handle the intractability of estimating the atmospheric light
colors, we exploit the grayscale version of our input image, since it is less
affected by varying light colors that are possibly present in the input image.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method both
quantitatively and qualitatively compared to the state-of-the-art methods in
handling dense and non-uniform fog or smoke.

traits transparently acquired by mobile devices during ordinary Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI), using a novel public database, BehavePassDB, and a standard
experimental protocol. The competition is divided into four tasks corresponding
to typical user activities: keystroke, text reading, gallery swiping, and
tapping. The data are composed of touchscreen data and several background
sensor data simultaneously acquired. ""Random"" (different users with different
devices) and ""skilled"" (different user on the same device attempting to imitate
the legitimate one) impostor scenarios are considered. The results achieved by
the participants show the feasibility of user authentication through behavioral
biometrics, although this proves to be a non-trivial challenge. MobileB2C will
be established as an on-going competition.

two-dimensional material devices. Here, local control of ferroelectric domains
in a marginally twisted WS2 bilayer is demonstrated with a scanning tunneling
microscope at room temperature, and their observed reversible evolution
understood using a string-like model of the domain wall network. We identify
two characteristic regimes of domain evolution: (i) elastic bending of partial
screw dislocations separating smaller domains with twin stacking and (ii)
formation of perfect screw dislocations by merging pairs of primary domain
walls. We also show that the latter act as the seeds for the reversible
restoration of the inverted polarisation. These results open the possibility to
achieve full control over atomically thin semiconducting ferroelectric domains
using local electric fields, which is a critical step towards their

realize a desired Hubbard model. SVM constrains the space of voltages by
rejecting voltage combinations producing potentials unsuitable for
tight-binding (TB) approximation. The target voltage combinations are then
identified by BO in the constrained subdomain. For large QD arrays, we propose
a scalable efficient iterative procedure using our SVM-BO approach, which
optimises voltage subsets and utilises a two-QD SVM model for large systems.

a high-resolution simulation using the Regional Ocean Modeling System.
Following observations, the model simulates the trapping and homogenization of
river water by a cyclonic mesoscale eddy on a sub-monthly time scale from
October-November of 2015. As fresh river water is trapped in the eddy, it is
characterized by strong vertical and lateral gradients in salinity. Within a
few weeks, these gradients relax along with the progressive homogenization of
freshwater within the eddy. A mixed layer salinity budget shows the importance
of ageostrophic vertical advection in addition to lateral advection during the
evolution of salinity within the eddy. An analysis of the eddy kinetic energy
(EKE) budget in the upper ocean indicates the development of barotropic and
baroclinic instabilities. The vertical profiles of EKE conversion terms reveal
that the surface freshwater was involved in the evolution of baroclinic
instability within the mixed layer. In addition, an eddy available potential
energy (EPE) budget shows that the entrainment of the river water raises the
EPE, which is due to an increase in lateral salinity gradients across the eddy
during the trapping event. Subsequently, the salinity homogenization leads to a
decrease in the EPE, and its rate of decay is modulated by a correlation
between surface buoyancy fluxes and density anomalies. Finally, reanalysis data
show similar trapping and homogenization events across multiple years,
highlighting the importance of this mechanism of subseasonal freshwater
evolution in the BoB.

However, data imbalance is often overlooked in applying the WS paradigm,
despite being a common issue in a variety of NLP tasks. To address this
challenge, we propose Adaptive Ranking-based Sample Selection (ARS2), a
model-agnostic framework to alleviate the data imbalance issue in the WS
paradigm. Specifically, it calculates a probabilistic margin score based on the
output of the current model to measure and rank the cleanliness of each data

motivations: (1) to train the model with balanced data batches to reduce the

collecting clean samples. Experiments on four text classification datasets with
four different imbalance ratios show that ARS2 outperformed the

However, previous work often used a static graph structure of time-series
variables for modeling MTS failing to capture their ever-changing correlations
over time. To this end, a fully-connected supra-graph connecting any two

high-resolution variable dependencies via an efficient graph convolutional

(EV-FGN) equipped with Fourier Graph Shift Operator (FGSO) which efficiently
performs graph convolution in the frequency domain. As a result, a
high-efficiency scale-free parameter learning scheme is derived for MTS

systematic generalization. We design a transformer-based robot agent, VIMA,
that processes these prompts and outputs motor actions autoregressively. VIMA
features a recipe that achieves strong model scalability and data efficiency.
It outperforms alternative designs in the hardest zero-shot generalization

hopping from the time-evolution operator stops the propagation of chiral edge
modes, leading to a non-Hermitian skin effect. This does not occur in Floquet
Chern insulators, however, in which boundary modes continue propagating. By
evaluating the local density of states, we found that the resulting
non-Hermitian skin effect is critical, i.e. scale-invariant, due to the nonzero
coupling between the bulk and the edge. Further, it is a consequence of the
nontrivial topology of the bulk Floquet operator, which we show by designing a
real-space topological invariant. Our work introduces a form of 'mixed'
higher-order topology, where a bulk system characterized by Floquet topology
produces a boundary system characterized by non-Hermitian topology, without the
need for any added perturbations. This opens an alternate direction in the
study of topological classifications, and provides a route towards generating
non-Hermitian skin effects by means of periodic driving.

However, cost functions corresponding to many problems of interest are
inherently global, defined by Hamiltonians with many-body interactions.
Consequently, the optimization landscape can exhibit exponentially vanishing
gradients, so-called barren plateaus, rendering optimal solutions difficult to
find. Strategies for mitigating barren plateaus are therefore needed to make
variational quantum algorithms trainable and capable of running on larger-scale
quantum computers. In this work, we contribute the toolbox of perturbative
gadgets to the portfolio of methods being explored in the quest for making
noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices useful. We introduce a novel
perturbative gadget, tailored to variational quantum algorithms, that can be
used to delay the onset of barren plateaus. Our perturbative gadget encodes an
arbitrary many-body Hamiltonian corresponding to a global cost function into
the low-energy subspace of a three-body Hamiltonian. Our construction requires
$rk$ additional qubits for a $k$-body Hamiltonian comprising $r$ terms. We
provide guarantees on the closeness of global minima and prove that the local

gas emission from the LEGA-C survey. H$\alpha$ is dynamically colder than
stars, with higher disc rotation velocities (by ~45 per cent) and lower disc
velocity dispersions (by a factor ~2). This is similar to trends observed in
the local Universe. We find higher rotational support for H$\alpha$ relative to
[OII], potentially explaining systematic offsets in kinematic scaling relations
found in the literature. Regarding dynamical mass measurements, for six
galaxies with cumulative mass profiles from Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian
Expansion (JAM) models the H$\alpha$ dynamical mass models agree remarkably
well out to ~10 kpc for all but one galaxy (average $\Delta M_{\rm

integrated stellar velocity dispersion are less accurate (standard deviation
0.24 dex). Differences in dynamical mass estimates are larger, for example, for

the photometric position angle, highlighting the added value of IFS

non-spinning/spinning particle where the brane and the particle do not
intersect with each other. From the bootstrap equations, we obtain the energy

particular, brane self-intersections, which are usually considered to be

we find a refined formula for the holographic Renyi entropy, which appears to
be crucial to correctly reproduce the boundary entropy term. On the other hand,
we explain why one-point functions of non-scalar primaries always vanish from
the gravity dual. The independence of the bootstrap equations to the boundary
entropy helps us to construct gravity duals with negative tension branes. We
also find a holographic dual of boundary primaries.

improvements are limited. We investigate large-scale augmentation with

densely-sampled 360 degree panoramas, construct navigation trajectories through
these panoramas, and generate a visually-grounded instruction for each
trajectory using Marky, a high-quality multilingual navigation instruction
generator. We also synthesize image observations from novel viewpoints using an
image-to-image GAN. The resulting dataset of 4.2M instruction-trajectory pairs
is two orders of magnitude larger than existing human-annotated datasets, and
contains a wider variety of environments and viewpoints. To efficiently
leverage data at this scale, we train a simple transformer agent with imitation

non-negligible eccentricity. Furthermore, many of them can undergo acceleration
because they reside in the presence of a tertiary. Here we develop analytical
and numerical methods to quantify how the compact binary's eccentricity
enhances the detection of its peculiar acceleration. We show that the general
relativistic precession pattern can disentangle the binary's
acceleration-induced frequency shift from the chirp-mass-induced frequency
shift in GW template fitting, thus relaxing the signal-to-noise ratio
requirement for distinguishing the acceleration by a factor of $10\sim100$.
Moreover, by adopting the GW templates of the accelerating eccentric compact
binaries, we can enhance the acceleration measurement accuracy by a factor of
$\sim100$, compared to the zero-eccentricity case, and detect the source's
acceleration even if it does not change during the observational time. For
example, a stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) with moderate eccentricity in
the LISA band yields an error of the acceleration measurement
$\sim10^{-7}m\cdot s^{-2}$ for $\rm{SNR}=20$ and observational time of $4$ yrs.
In this example, we can measure the BBHs' peculiar acceleration even when it is
$\sim1\rm pc$ away from a $4\times 10^{6}\rm M_{\odot}$ SMBH. Our results

curves between distribution functions in an ensemble as a transformation to
apply to another distribution function, thus transferring the variation in the
ensemble to the latter distribution function. This procedure is broadly
applicable to the problem of uncertainty propagation. In the context of
redshift distributions, for example, the uncertainty contribution due to
certain effects can be studied effectively only in simulations, thus
necessitating a transfer of variation measured in simulations to the redshift
distributions measured from data. We illustrate the use of PITPZ by using the

unlikely to merge. The next-generation ground-based GW detectors, Cosmic

Galactic ecosystem, our knowledge of the physical properties of the hot phase
of the Milky Way is still inadequate. However, sensitive SRG/eROSITA large area
surveys are now providing us with the long sought-after data needed to mend
this state of affairs. We present the properties of the soft X-ray emission as
observed by eROSITA in the eFEDS field. We measure the temperature and metal
abundance of the hot circum-Galactic medium (CGM) to be within
$kT_{CGM}=0.153-0.178$ keV and $Z_{CGM}=0.052-0.072$ $Z_\odot$, depending on
the contribution of solar wind charge exchange (SWCX). Slightly larger CGM
abundances $Z_{CGM}=0.05-0.10$ $Z_\odot$ are possible, considering the
uncertain extrapolation of the extragalactic Cosmic X-ray background (CXB)
emission below $\sim1$ keV. To recover CGM abundances as large as $Z_{CGM}=0.3$
$Z_\odot$, it must be postulated the presence of an additional component,
likely associated with the warm-hot intergalactic medium, providing
$\sim15-20$% of the flux in the soft X-ray band. The emission in the soft band
is dominated by the CGM, with contributions from the CXB and the local hot
bubble. Moreover, the eROSITA data require the presence of an additional
component associated with the elusive Galactic corona plus a possible
contribution from unresolved M dwarf stars. This component has a temperature of
$kT\sim0.4-0.7$ keV and it might be out of thermal equilibrium. It contributes
$\sim9$% to the total emission in the 0.6--2 keV band, therefore it is a likely
candidate to produce part of the unresolved CXB flux observed in X-ray
ultra-deep fields. We also observe a significant contribution to the soft X-ray
flux due to SWCX, during periods characterised by stronger solar wind activity,
and causing the largest uncertainty on the determination of the CGM

free fermions, we calculated the time-direction entanglement entropy in a set
of times $t_n=n\tau$ ($1\le n\le K$) on the same site, and identified a
stabilizing transition at $\tau=\tau_0=2\pi/E_0$, where $E_0$ is the energy
range of single-fermion spectrum. At zero temperature, the time-like
entanglement entropy of the lattice fermion with $\tau<\tau_0$ resembles the
Cardy formula for one flavor of chiral fermion. For generic slices, the
entanglement entropy shows a clear transition between spacelike and timelike
slices. We conjecture $\tau_0$ is the upper bound of time period for
consecutive local observations to retrieve information from a quantum state,
and conjecture a similar $\tau_0$ exists in interacting models.

primarily based on UV-selected galaxies (i.e., LBGs). Recent studies of
H-dropouts have revealed that we may be missing a large proportion of star
formation that is taking place in massive galaxies at z>3. In this work, we
extend the H-dropout criterion to lower masses to select optically dark/faint
galaxies (OFGs), in order to complete the census between LBGs and H-dropouts.
Our criterion (H> 26.5 mag & [4.5] < 25 mag) combined with a de-blending
technique is designed to select not only extremely dust-obscured massive
galaxies but also normal star-forming galaxies. In total, we identified 27 OFGs
at z_phot > 3 (z_med=4.1) in the GOODS-ALMA field, covering a wide distribution
of stellar masses with log($M_{\star}$/$M_{\odot}$) = 9.4-11.1. We find that up
to 75% of the OFGs with log($M_{\star}$/$M_{\odot}$) = 9.5-10.5 were neglected
by previous LBGs and H-dropout selection techniques. After performing stacking
analyses, the OFGs exhibit shorter gas depletion timescales, slightly lower gas
fractions, and lower dust temperatures than typical star-forming galaxies.
Their SFR_tot (SFR_ IR+SFR_UV) is much larger than SFR_UVcorr (corrected for
dust extinction), with SFR_tot/SFR_UVcorr = $8\pm1$, suggesting the presence of
hidden dust regions in the OFGs that absorb all UV photons. The average dust
size measured by a circular Gaussian model fit is R_e(1.13 mm)=1.01$\pm$0.05
kpc. We find that the cosmic SFRD at z>3 contributed by massive OFGs is at
least two orders of magnitude higher than the one contributed by equivalently
massive LBGs. Finally, we calculate the combined contribution of OFGs and LBGs
to the cosmic SFRD at z=4-5 to be 4 $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ $M_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-3}$, which is about 0.15 dex (43%) higher than the SFRD derived
from UV-selected samples alone at the same redshift.

continuous domains, without any digitalization, and with remarkably few qubits.
The basic building block of our approach is a variational quantum circuit where
each qubit encodes up to three continuous variables (two angles and one radious
in the Bloch sphere). By combining this encoding with quantum state tomography,
a variational quantum circuit of $n$ qubits can optimize functions of up to
$3n$ continuous variables in an analog way. We then explain how this quantum
algorithm for continuous optimization is at the basis of a whole toolbox for
mathematical analysis on quantum computers. For instance, we show how to use it
to compute arbitrary series expansions such as, e.g., Fourier (harmonic)
decompositions. In turn, Fourier analysis allows us to implement essentially
any task related to function calculus, including the evaluation of
multidimensional definite integrals, solving (systems of) differential
equations, and more. To prove the validity of our approach, we provide

(DM): the same annihilation process that determined the relic abundance in the
early Universe drives the present day astrophysical signal. While TeV-scale
particles weakly coupled to the Standard Model face undoubted challenges from
decades of null searches, the scenario remains compelling, and simple
realizations such as Higgsino DM remain largely unexplored. The fate of such
scenarios could be determined by gamma-ray observations of the centre of the
Milky Way with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). We consider
the ultimate sensitivity of current IACTs to a broad range of TeV-scale DM
candidates - including specific ones such as the Wino, Higgsino, and
Quintuplet. To do so, we use realistic mock H.E.S.S.-like observations of the
inner Milky Way halo, and provide a careful assessment of the impact of recent
Milky Way mass modeling, instrumental and astrophysical background
uncertainties in the Galactic Center region, and the theoretical uncertainty on
the predicted signal. We find that the dominant systematic for IACT searches in
the inner Galaxy is the unknown distribution of DM in that region, however,
beyond this the searches are currently statistically dominated indicating a
continued benefit from more observations. For two-body final states at $1~{\rm
TeV}$, we find a H.E.S.S.-like observatory is sensitive to $\langle \sigma v
\rangle \sim 3 \times 10^{-26}-4 \times 10^{-25}~{\rm cm}^3{\rm s}^{-1}$,
except for neutrino final states, although we find results competitive with
ANTARES. In addition, the thermal masses for the Wino and Quintuplet can be
probed; the Higgsino continues to be out of reach by at least a factor of a
few. Our conclusions are also directly relevant to the next generation
Cherenkov Telescope Array, which remains well positioned to be the discovery
instrument for thermal DM.

ideas together to describe the many-body dynamics of an extended atomic array
coupled to a squeezed vacuum. We show that fluctuations can drive the array
into a pure dark state decoupled from the environment. The dark state is
obtained for an even number of atoms and consists of maximally entangled atomic
pairs, or dimers, that mimic the behavior of the squeezed field. Each pair
displays reduced fluctuations in one polarization quadrature and amplified in
another. This dissipation-induced stabilization relies on an efficient transfer
of correlations between pairs of photons and atoms. It uncovers the mechanism
through which squeezed light causes an atomic array to self-organize and
illustrates the increasing importance of spatial correlations in modern quantum
technologies where many-body effects play a central role.

effective at high-resolution image generation, and they have been widely used
in large-scale diffusion frameworks including DALLE-2, Stable Diffusion and
Imagen. However, a downside of classifier-free guided diffusion models is that
they are computationally expensive at inference time since they require
evaluating two diffusion models, a class-conditional model and an unconditional
model, tens to hundreds of times. To deal with this limitation, we propose an
approach to distilling classifier-free guided diffusion models into models that
are fast to sample from: Given a pre-trained classifier-free guided model, we
first learn a single model to match the output of the combined conditional and
unconditional models, and then we progressively distill that model to a
diffusion model that requires much fewer sampling steps. For standard diffusion
models trained on the pixel-space, our approach is able to generate images
visually comparable to that of the original model using as few as 4 sampling
steps on ImageNet 64x64 and CIFAR-10, achieving FID/IS scores comparable to
that of the original model while being up to 256 times faster to sample from.
For diffusion models trained on the latent-space (e.g., Stable Diffusion), our
approach is able to generate high-fidelity images using as few as 1 to 4
denoising steps, accelerating inference by at least 10-fold compared to
existing methods on ImageNet 256x256 and LAION datasets. We further demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach on text-guided image editing and inpainting,

temperature annealing giving better results. The achievable maximum
temperatures are limited to the levels at which coating damage, such as
crystallization, cracking, or bubbling will occur. Coating damage caused by
heating is typically only observed statically, after annealing. An experimental
method to dynamically observe how and over what temperature range such damage
occurs during annealing is desirable as its results could inform manufacturing
and annealing processes to ultimately achieve better coating performance. We
developed a new instrument that features an industrial annealing oven with
holes cut into its sides for viewports to illuminate optical samples and
observe their coating scatter and eventual damage mechanisms in-situ and in
real-time during annealing. We present results that demonstrate in-situ
observation of changes to titania-doped tantala coatings on fused silica
substrates. We obtain a spatial image (mapping) of the evolution of these
changes during annealing, an advantage over x-ray diffraction, electron beam,

changes to be due to crystallization. We further discuss the utility of this
apparatus for observing other forms of coating damage such as cracking and
blisters.

robustness against different $L_p$ norms, we show that there is potential for
improvement against many commonly used attacks by adopting a domain

and apply the Risk Extrapolation method (REx), which promotes similar levels of
robustness against all training attacks. Compared to existing methods, we
obtain similar or superior worst-case adversarial robustness on attacks seen

evaluations continue to require significant manual data wrangling owing to the
data heterogeneity. Here, we propose an artificial intelligence-based solution
for the aggregation and processing of multisequence neuro-oncology MRI data to
extract quantitative tumor measurements. Our end-to-end framework i) classifies
MRI sequences using an ensemble classifier, ii) preprocesses the data in a
reproducible manner, iii) delineates tumor tissue subtypes using convolutional
neural networks, and iv) extracts diverse radiomic features. Moreover, it is
robust to missing sequences and adopts an expert-in-the-loop approach, where
the segmentation results may be manually refined by radiologists. Following the
implementation of the framework in Docker containers, it was applied to two
retrospective glioma datasets collected from the Washington University School
of Medicine (WUSM; n = 384) and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDA; n = 30)
comprising preoperative MRI scans from patients with pathologically confirmed
gliomas. The scan-type classifier yielded an accuracy of over 99%, correctly
identifying sequences from 380/384 and 30/30 sessions from the WUSM and MDA
datasets, respectively. Segmentation performance was quantified using the Dice
Similarity Coefficient between the predicted and expert-refined tumor masks.
Mean Dice scores were 0.882 ($\pm$0.244) and 0.977 ($\pm$0.04) for whole tumor
segmentation for WUSM and MDA, respectively. This streamlined framework
automatically curated, processed, and segmented raw MRI data of patients with
varying grades of gliomas, enabling the curation of large-scale neuro-oncology
datasets and demonstrating a high potential for integration as an assistive
tool in clinical practice.

characterized by single neuron tuning curves and analysis of population

models that constrain the relationship between latent variables and neural
activity, modeled by simple tuning curve functions. This has recently been
demonstrated using Gaussian processes, with applications to realistic and
topologically relevant latent manifolds. Those and previous models, however,
missed crucial shared coding properties of neural populations. We propose
feature sharing across neural tuning curves which significantly improves
performance and helps optimization. We also propose a solution to the ensemble
detection problem, where different groups of neurons, i.e., ensembles, can be
modulated by different latent manifolds. Achieved through a soft clustering of
neurons during training, this allows for the separation of mixed neural
populations in an unsupervised manner. These innovations lead to more
interpretable models of neural population activity that train well and perform
better even on mixtures of complex latent manifolds. Finally, we apply our
method on a recently published grid cell dataset, and recover distinct
ensembles, infer toroidal latents and predict neural tuning curves in a single

dependency of the inflow, outflow and net accretion rates onto the discs of
Milky Way-like galaxies. The net accretion rates are found to be similar for
all galaxies at early times, increasing rapidly up to $\sim 10~\mathrm{M}_\odot
\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. After $\sim 6~\mathrm{Gyr}$ of evolution, however, the
net accretion rates are diverse: in most galaxies, these exhibit an
exponential-like decay, but some systems instead present increasing or
approximately constant levels up to the present time. An exponential fit to the
net accretion rates averaged over the MW analogues yields typical decay
time-scale of $7.2~\mathrm{Gyr}$. The analysis of the time-evolution of the
inflow and outflow rates, and their relation to the star formation rate (SFR)
in the discs, confirms the close connection between these quantities. First,
the inflow$/$outflow ratio stays approximately constant, with typical values of
$\dot{M}_\mathrm{out}/ \dot{M}_\mathrm{in} \sim 0.75$, indicating that the gas
mass involved in outflows is of the order of 25% lower compared to that
involved in inflows. A similar behaviour is found for the SFR$/$inflow rate
ratio, with typical values between 0.1 and 0.3, and for the outflow rate$/$SFR
which varies in the range $3.5$--$5.5$. Our results show that continuous inflow
is key to the SFR levels in disc galaxies, and that the star formation activity
and the subsequent feedback in the discs is able to produce mass-loaded galaxy
winds in the disc-halo interface.

Generator(NVMG) which can generate novel and high-quality volumetric meshes.
Unlike the previous 3D generative model for point cloud, voxel, and implicit

industry with details on both the surface and interior. Generating this such
highly-structured data thus brings a significant challenge. We first propose a
diffusion-based generative model to tackle this problem by generating voxelized
shapes with close-to-reality outlines and structures. We can simply obtain a
tetrahedral mesh as a template with the voxelized shape. Further, we use a
voxel-conditional neural network to predict the smooth implicit surface
conditioned on the voxels, and progressively project the tetrahedral mesh to
the predicted surface under regularizations. The regularization terms are
carefully designed so that they can (1) get rid of the defects like flipping
and high distortion; (2) force the regularity of the interior and surface
structure during the deformation procedure for a high-quality final mesh. As
shown in the experiments, our pipeline can generate high-quality artifact-free
volumetric and surface meshes from random noise or a reference image without
any post-processing. Compared with the state-of-the-art voxel-to-mesh
deformation method, we show more robustness and better performance when taking

importance of a floor plan model in accurately simulating the channel; it is
confirmed that path loss can be replicated with a simple interior path loss
model in place of a detailed building interior model, but neglecting to model
the interior results in high delay and angular spread errors. By modeling the
interior, the ray-tracing simulations achieve relative mean error of under 10%
for delay and angular spreads. Finally, effects of multi-layer insulating
window on propagation simulations are reported. Noticeable variation of the
penetration loss on a small change of the incident angle of a propagation path
causes large changes in estimated coverage.

where data collection and model fitting alternate sequentially, we prove that
model performance improves initially but can stall after only three rounds.
Label noise arising from, for instance, annotator disagreement leads to even
stronger negative results. Our second model generalizes the first to the case
where data collection and model fitting have a hierarchical dependency

there are $n$ servers and, at each of $n$ time steps, a request arrives and
must be irrevocably matched to a server that has not yet been matched to, with
the goal of minimizing the sum of the distances between the matched pairs.
Despite achieving a worst-case competitive ratio that is exponential in $n$,
the simple greedy algorithm, which matches each request to its nearest
available free server, performs very well in practice. A major question is thus
to explain greedy's strong empirical performance. In this paper, we aim to
understand the performance of greedy over instances that are at least partially
random. When both the requests and the servers are drawn uniformly and
independently from $[0,1]$, we show that greedy is constant competitive, which
improves over the previously best-known $O(\sqrt{n})$ bound. We extend this
constant competitive ratio to a setting with a linear excess of servers, which
improves over the previously best-known $O(\log^3{n})$ bound. We moreover show
that in the semi-random model where the requests are still drawn uniformly and
independently but where the servers are chosen adversarially, greedy achieves
an $O(\log{n})$ competitive ratio. When the requests arrive in a random order
but are chosen adversarially, it was previously known that greedy is
$O(n)$-competitive. Even though this one-sided randomness allows a large
improvement in greedy's competitive ratio compared to the model where requests
are adversarial and arrive in a random order, we show that it is not sufficient
to obtain a constant competitive ratio by giving a tight $\Omega(\log{n})$
lower bound. These results invite further investigation about how much
randomness is necessary and sufficient to obtain strong theoretical guarantees
for the greedy algorithm for online minimum cost matching, on the line and
beyond.

various properties of the output like style and length. Inspired by recent work
on causal inference for NLP, this paper reveals a previously overlooked flaw in
these control code-based conditional text generation algorithms. Spurious
correlations in the training data can lead models to incorrectly rely on parts
of the input other than the control code for attribute selection, significantly
undermining downstream generation quality and controllability. We demonstrate
the severity of this issue with a series of case studies and then propose two
simple techniques to reduce these correlations in training sets. The first
technique is based on resampling the data according to an example's propensity
towards each linguistic attribute (IPS). The second produces multiple
counterfactual versions of each example and then uses an additional feedback
mechanism to remove noisy examples (feedback aware self-training, FAST). We
evaluate on 3 tasks -- news headline, meta review, and search ads generation --
and demonstrate that FAST can significantly improve the controllability and
language quality of generated outputs when compared to state-of-the-art
controllable text generation approaches.

simple and standard ResNet-18 architecture. To this end, we built on top of
prior art by training the model with a standard preprocessing strategy but
using images from several public sources and an empirically calibrated data
augmentation setting. To evaluate its performance, we covered multiple
clinically relevant perspectives, including image and patient level DR
screening, discriminating responses by input quality and DR grade, assessing
model uncertainties and analyzing its results in a qualitative manner. With no
other methodological innovation than a carefully designed training, our ResNet
model achieved an AUC = 0.955 (0.953 - 0.956) on a combined test set of 61007
test images from different public datasets, which is in line or even better
than what other more complex deep learning models reported in the literature.
Similar AUC values were obtained in 480 images from two separate in-house

ability. This confirms that standard networks can still be strong baselines for

derived from a repulsive Gaussian potential depending on the difference between
its instantaneous position, $\mathbf{r}(t)$, and its earlier position
$\mathbf{r}(t-\tau)$, where $\tau$ is the delay time. Considering first the
deterministic case, we provide analytical results for both, the case of small
displacements and the dynamics at long times. In particular, at appropriate
values of the feedback parameters, the particle approaches a steady state with
a constant, non-zero velocity whose direction is constant as well. In the
presence of noise, the direction of motion becomes randomized at long times,
but the (numerically obtained) velocity autocorrelation still reveals some
persistence of motion. Moreover, the mean-squared displacement (MSD) reveals a
mixed regime at intermediate times with contributions of both, ballistic motion
and diffusive translational motion, allowing us to extract an estimate for the
effective propulsion velocity in presence of noise. We then analyze the data in
terms of exact, known results for the MSD of active Brownian particles. The
comparison indeed indicates a strong similarity between the dynamics of the
particle under repulsive delayed feedback and active motion. This relation
carries over to the behavior of the long-time diffusion coefficient
$D_\mathrm{eff}$ which, similarly to active motion, is strongly enhanced
compared to the free case. Finally we show that, for small delays,

diode is found to persist across the broad temperature range. Magnetic field
application unveils a peculiar reentrant characteristic where diode behavior is
suppressed in remnant field but reappears after warming to room temperature.
Analysis of I-V data suggests a modest energy gap, 0.03-0.1 eV, which is
comparable to magnetic Coulomb's interaction energy between emergent magnetic
charges on honeycomb vertices in the reverse biased state. It affirms the role

requires an energy density profile of the system as an initial condition. In
the process of converting the two colliding nuclei into such an energy
distribution, some specification about the $\textit{size}$ of their constituent
nucleons inevitably has to be made. Nucleons are commonly modeled as
bidimensional Gaussians, and the Gaussian width (the nucleon-width) is a free
parameter of the simulation. A best-fit value of the nucleon-width can be
inferred by Bayesian Analyses, where the model is confronted with experimental
data.
  Some of the most recent analyses have obtained surprisingly large values for
the nucleon width parameter, exceeding in over 50 % the current value for the
proton charged radius. This motivates the development of a better understanding
of the role played by this parameter inside the simulation.
  In this work, we perform simulations of Pb-Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV using a state-of-the-art hybrid simulation
chain, using three different values of the nucleon width inside the initial
condition generator T$_{\text{R}}$ENTo, and systematically investigate its
effects on the initial condition characteristics and observables. The
nucleon-width strongly affects the eccentricity harmonics and the gradients in
the initial condition. The $\langle p_{T} \rangle$ of particles in the
simulation using $w$ = 0.5 fm is much larger than experimental data. We
associate this to the combination of stronger gradients in the initial
condition and the coupling of a conformal pre-equilibrium dynamics to the
hydrodynamic simulation. Our findings suggest that the large values of the
nucleon width returned by recent Bayesian Analyses were necessary to lower the
mean transverse momentum, by damping the gradients in the initial condition.

propagation through nonuniform media. However, the underlying
geometrical-optics (GO) approximation of ray optics breaks down at caustics,
erroneously predicting the wave intensity to be infinite and thereby limiting
the predictive capabilities of GO-based codes. Full-wave modeling can be used
instead, but the added computational cost brings its own set of tradeoffs.
Developing more efficient caustic remedies has therefore been an active area of
research for the past few decades. In this thesis, I present a new ray-based
approach called 'metaplectic geometrical optics' (MGO) that can be applied to
any linear wave equation. Instead of evolving waves in the usual x (coordinate)
or k (spectral) representation, MGO uses a mixed X=Ax+B representation. By
continuously adjusting the coefficients A and B along the rays via sequenced
metaplectic transforms (MTs) of the wavefield, corresponding to symplectic
transformations of the ray phase space, one can ensure that GO remains valid in
the X coordinates without caustic singularities. The caustic-free result is
then mapped back onto the original x space using metaplectic transforms, as
demonstrated on a number of examples. Besides outlining the basic theory, this
thesis also presents specialized fast algorithms for MGO. These algorithms
focus on the MT, which is a unitary integral mapping that can be considered a
generalization of the Fourier transform. First, a discrete representation of
the MT is developed that can be computed in linear time when evaluated in the
near-identity limit; finite MTs can then be implemented by iterating $K\gg 1$
near-identity MTs. Second, an algorithm based on Gauss--Freud quadrature is
developed for efficiently computing finite MTs along their steepest-descent
curves, which may be useful in catastrophe-optics applications beyond MGO.

ecologically and statistically constrained, with many network properties being
correlated with each other. Despite the recognition of these invariable
relationships in food webs, the use of the principle of maximum entropy
(MaxEnt) in network ecology is still rare. This is surprising considering that
MaxEnt is a statistical tool precisely designed for understanding and
predicting many different types of constrained systems. Precisely, this
principle asserts that the least-biased probability distribution of a system's
property, constrained by prior knowledge about that system, is the one with
maximum information entropy. Here we show how MaxEnt can be used to derive many
food-web properties both analytically and heuristically. First, we show how the
joint degree distribution (the joint probability distribution of the numbers of
prey and predators for each species in the network) can be derived analytically
using the number of species and the number of interactions in food webs.
Second, we present a heuristic and flexible approach of finding a network's
adjacency matrix (the network's representation in matrix format) based on
simulated annealing and SVD entropy. We built two heuristic models using the
connectance and the joint degree sequence as statistical constraints,
respectively. We compared both models' predictions against corresponding null
and neutral models commonly used in network ecology using open access data of
terrestrial and aquatic food webs sampled globally. We found that the heuristic
model constrained by the joint degree sequence was a good predictor of many
measures of food-web structure, especially the nestedness and motifs
distribution. Specifically, our results suggest that the structure of
terrestrial and aquatic food webs is mainly driven by their joint degree
distribution.

is true by studying the glassy dynamics of interacting chiral active Brownian
particles (cABPs). We demonstrate that when our chiral fluid is pushed to
glassy conditions, it exhibits highly nontrivial dynamics, especially compared
to a standard linear active fluid such as common ABPs. Despite the added

manipulation-proof and proper consensus-based preference aggregation rules, so
powerfully called in doubt by a disputable if widely shared understanding of
Arrow's `general possibility theorem'. We consider two alternative versions of
agenda manipulation-proofness for social welfare functions, that are
distinguished by `parallel' vs. `sequential' execution of agenda formation and
preference elicitation, respectively. Under the `parallel' version, it is shown
that a large class of anonymous and idempotent social welfare functions that
satisfy both agenda manipulation-proofness and strategy-proofness on a natural
domain of single-peaked `meta-preferences' induced by arbitrary total
preference preorders are indeed available. It is only under the second,
`sequential' version that agenda manipulation-proofness on the same natural
domain of single-peaked `meta-preferences' is in fact shown to be tightly
related to the classic Arrowian `independence of irrelevant alternatives' (IIA)
for social welfare functions. In particular, it is shown that using IIA to
secure such `sequential' version of agenda manipulation-proofness and combining
it with a very minimal requirement of distributed responsiveness results in a
characterization of the `global stalemate' social welfare function, the
constant function which invariably selects universal social indifference. It is
also argued that, altogether, the foregoing results provide new significant
insights concerning the actual content and the constructive implications of
Arrow's `general possibility theorem' from a mechanism-design perspective.

$N$-body simulations to construct Gaussian process emulators of galaxy
clustering statistics at small scales ($0.1-50 \: h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$) in
order to constrain cosmological and galaxy bias parameters. In addition to
standard statistics -- the projected correlation function
$w_\mathrm{p}(r_\mathrm{p})$, the redshift-space monopole of the correlation
function $\xi_0(s)$, and the quadrupole $\xi_2(s)$ -- we emulate statistics
that include information about the local environment, namely the underdensity
probability function $P_\mathrm{U}(s)$ and the density-marked correlation
function $M(s)$. This extends the model of AEMULUS III for redshift-space
distortions by including new statistics sensitive to galaxy assembly bias. In
recovery tests, we find that the beyond-standard statistics significantly
increase the constraining power on cosmological parameters of interest:
including $P_\mathrm{U}(s)$ and $M(s)$ improves the precision of our
constraints on $\sigma_8$ by 33%, $\Omega_m$ by 28%, and the growth of
structure parameter, $f \sigma_8$, by 18% compared to standard statistics. We
additionally find that scales below $4 \: h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ contain as much
information as larger scales. The density-sensitive statistics also contribute
to constraining halo occupation distribution parameters and a flexible
environment-dependent assembly bias model, which is important for extracting
the small-scale cosmological information as well as understanding the
galaxy-halo connection. This analysis demonstrates the potential of emulating
beyond-standard clustering statistics at small scales to constrain the growth

consumption. For example, training a DNN requires high dynamic memory, a
large-scale dataset, and a large number of computations (a long training time);
even inference with a DNN also demands a large amount of static storage,
computations (a long inference time), and energy. Therefore, state-of-the-art
DNNs are often deployed on a cloud server with a large number of
super-computers, a high-bandwidth communication bus, a shared storage
infrastructure, and a high power supplement.
  Recently, some new emerging intelligent applications, e.g., AR/VR, mobile

resource-constrained edge devices. Compare to a cloud server, edge devices
often have a rather small amount of resources. To deploy DNNs on edge devices,
we need to reduce the size of DNNs, i.e., we target a better trade-off between
resource consumption and model accuracy.
  In this dissertation, we studied four edge intelligence scenarios, i.e.,
Inference on Edge Devices, Adaptation on Edge Devices, Learning on Edge
Devices, and Edge-Server Systems, and developed different methodologies to
enable deep learning in each scenario. Since current DNNs are often
over-parameterized, our goal is to find and reduce the redundancy of the DNNs

problems in computer vision, speech recognition, object detection, to name a
few. The principal reason for this success is the availability of huge datasets
for training deep neural networks (DNNs). However, datasets can not be publicly
released if they contain sensitive information such as medical or financial
records. In such cases, data privacy becomes a major concern. Encryption
methods offer a possible solution to this issue, however their deployment on ML
applications is non-trivial, as they seriously impact the classification
accuracy and result in substantial computational overhead.Alternatively,
obfuscation techniques can be used, but maintaining a good balance between
visual privacy and accuracy is challenging. In this work, we propose a method
to generate secure synthetic datasets from the original private datasets. In
our method, given a network with Batch Normalization (BN) layers pre-trained on
the original dataset, we first record the layer-wise BN statistics. Next, using
the BN statistics and the pre-trained model, we generate the synthetic dataset
by optimizing random noises such that the synthetic data match the layer-wise
statistical distribution of the original model. We evaluate our method on image
classification dataset (CIFAR10) and show that our synthetic data can be used
for training networks from scratch, producing reasonable classification
performance.

Computer Science, Operations Research, and Financial Engineering. Solving MIPs
is NP-Hard in general, but several solvers have found success in obtaining
near-optimal solutions for problems of intermediate size. Branch-and-Cut
algorithms, which combine Branch-and-Bound logic with cutting-plane routines,
are at the core of modern MIP solvers. Montanaro proposed a quantum algorithm
with a near-quadratic speedup compared to classical Branch-and-Bound algorithms
in the worst case, when every optimal solution is desired. In practice,
however, a near-optimal solution is satisfactory, and by leveraging tree-search
heuristics to search only a portion of the solution tree, classical algorithms
can perform much better than the worst-case guarantee. In this paper, we
propose a quantum algorithm, Incremental-Quantum-Branch-and-Bound, with
universal near-quadratic speedup over classical Branch-and-Bound algorithms for
every input, i.e., if classical Branch-and-Bound has complexity $Q$ on an
instance that leads to solution depth $d$, Incremental-Quantum-Branch-and-Bound
offers the same guarantees with a complexity of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{Q}d)$. Our
results are valid for a wide variety of search heuristics, including
depth-based, cost-based, and $A^{\ast}$ heuristics. Universal speedups are also
obtained for Branch-and-Cut as well as heuristic tree search. Our algorithms
are directly comparable to commercial MIP solvers, and guarantee near quadratic
speedup whenever $Q \gg d$. We use numerical simulation to verify that $Q \gg
d$ for typical instances of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, Maximum
Independent Set, and Portfolio Optimization; as well as to extrapolate the
dependence of $Q$ on input size parameters. This allows us to project the
typical performance of our quantum algorithms for these important problems.

first X-ray detection on day 727 with the Chandra. The SN was subsequently
detected in the VLA radio bands from day 1000 onwards. While the radio data are
sparse, synchrotron-self absorption is clearly ruled out as the radio
absorption mechanism. The near- and the mid-IR observations showed that late
time IR emission dominates the spectral energy distribution. The early
properties of \snhcc\ are consistent with shock breakout into a dense mass-loss
region, with $\dot M \sim 0.1 M_\odot \rm yr^{-1}$ for a decade. At few 100
days, the mass-loss rate declined to $\sim 0.02 M_\odot \rm yr^{-1}$, as
determined from the dominant IR luminosity. In addition, radio data also
allowed us to calculate a mass-loss rate at around day 1000, which is two
orders of magnitude smaller than the mass-loss rate estimates around the
bolometric peak. These values indicate that the SN progenitor underwent an
enhanced mass-loss event a decade before the explosion. The high ratio of IR to

albedo, which quantifies the specularity of the reflecting satellite. Unlike
stellar magnitude units, the effective albedo accounts for apparent range and
phase angle and enables direct comparison of different satellites. Mapping the
effective albedo from multiple observations across the sky produces an all-sky
photometric signature which is distinct for each population of satellites,
including the various sub-models of Starlink satellites. Space Situational
Awareness (SSA) practitioners can use all-sky photometric signatures to
differentiate populations of satellites, compare their reflection
characteristics, identify unknown satellites, and find anomalous members. To
test the efficacy of all-sky signatures for satellite identification, we
applied a machine learning classifier algorithm which correctly identified the
majority of satellites based solely on the effective albedo metric and with as
few as one observation per individual satellite. Our new method of LEO
satellite photometric characterization requires no prior knowledge of the
satellite's properties and is readily scalable to large numbers of satellites

generic situation for causal geodesics. It is argued that these results may be
of interest for causality issues. Recall that the presence of superluminal
signals in a generic space time $(M, g_{\mu\nu})$ does not necessarily imply
violations of the principle of causality [1]-[12]. In flat spaces, global
Lorenz invariance leads to the conclusion that closed time like curves appear
if these signals are present. In a curved space instead, there is only local
Poincare invariance, and the presence of closed causal curves may be avoided
even in presence of a superluminal mode, specially when terms violating the
strong equivalence principle appear in the action. This implies that the
standard analytic properties of the spectral components of these functions are
therefore modified and, in particular, the refraction index $n(\omega)$ is not
analytic in the upper complex $\omega$ plane. The emergence of this
singularities may also take place for non superluminal signals, due to the
breaking of global Lorenz invariance in a generic space time. In the present
work, it is argued that the homotopy properties of the Maslov index
\cite{maslov} are useful for studying how the singularities of $n(\omega)$ vary
when moving along a geodesic congruence. In addition, several conclusions
obtained in [1]-[12] are based on the Penrose limit along a null geodesic, and
they are restricted to GR with matter satisfying strong energy conditions. The
use of the Maslov index may allow a more intrinsic description of
singularities, not relying on that limit, and a generalization of these results
about non analiticity to generic gravity models with general matter content.

internal or external MO (IMO or EMO), not only determines the abundances of
life-essential volatiles like nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) in its core and
mantle reservoirs but also the timing and mechanism of volatile loss. Whether
the earliest formed protoplanets had IMOs or EMOs is, however, poorly
understood. Here we model equilibrium N and C partitioning between alloy and
silicate melts in the absence (IMO) or presence (EMO) of vapor degassed
atmospheres. Bulk N and C inventories of the protoplanets during core formation
are constrained for IMOs and EMOs by comparing the predicted N and C abundances
in the alloy melts from both scenarios with N and C concentrations in the
parent cores of magmatic iron meteorites. Our results show that in comparison
to EMOs, protoplanets having IMOs satisfy N and C contents of the parent cores
with substantially lower amounts of bulk N and C present in the parent body
during core formation. As the required bulk N and C contents for IMOs and EMOs
are in the sub-chondritic and chondritic range, respectively, N and C
fractionation models alone cannot be used to distinguish the prevalence of
these two end-member differentiation regimes. A comparison of N and C
abundances in chondrites with their peak metamorphic temperatures suggests that
protoplanetary interiors could lose a substantial portion of their N and C

by storm surge and tide, a new neural network architecture is proposed based on
Fourier feature embeddings that seamlessly encodes the periodic tidal boundary
condition in the PINN's formulation. Furthermore, we show that the PINN-based
downscaling can produce more reasonable subgrid solutions of the along-channel

the simple linear interpolation in resolving the topography and dynamic flow

with both the trans-Planckian and sub-Planckian inflation regimes consistent
with the recent Planck/BICEP combined results. Reheating via the inflation

accelerators to achieve practical speed. Logic locking is one of the most
popular methods for preventing chip counterfeiting. Nevertheless, existing
logic-locking schemes need to sacrifice the number of input patterns leading to
wrong output under incorrect keys to resist the powerful satisfiability
(SAT)-attack. Furthermore, DNN model inference is fault-tolerant. Hence, using
a wrong key for those SAT-resistant logic-locking schemes may not affect the
accuracy of DNNs. This makes the previous SAT-resistant logic-locking scheme
ineffective on protecting DNN accelerators. Besides, to prevent DNN models from
being illegally used, the models need to be obfuscated by the designers before
they are provided to end-users. Previous obfuscation methods either require
long time to retrain the model or leak information about the model. This paper
proposes a joint protection scheme for DNN hardware accelerators and models.
The DNN accelerator is modified using a hardware key (Hkey) and a model key
(Mkey). Different from previous logic locking, the Hkey, which is used to
protect the accelerator, does not affect the output when it is wrong. As a
result, the SAT attack can be effectively resisted. On the other hand, a wrong
Hkey leads to substantial increase in memory accesses, inference time, and
energy consumption and makes the accelerator unusable. A correct Mkey can
recover the DNN model that is obfuscated by the proposed method. Compared to
previous model obfuscation schemes, our proposed method avoids model retraining

that the negative exciton formation energies are only a prerequisite but
insufficient condition for realizing an EI. By a comparative study between the
cases of both a conduction and valence flat bands (FBs) versus that of a
parabolic conduction band, we further show that the presence and increased FB
contribution to exciton formation provide an attractive avenue to stabilize the

low-rank and sparsity of the presented adversarial contrastive embedding to
adaptively estimate the coefficients of the regularizers automatically to the
optimum weights. The sparsity constraint suppresses less representative
elements in the feature space. The low-rank constraint eliminates trivial and
redundant components and enables superior generalization. The performance of
the proposed model is verified by conducting ablation studies by using
benchmark datasets for scenarios with small data samples.

Further, in multi-task settings, individually fine-tuning and storing separate

reparameterization of the objective and exploiting the sparse Bayesian learning
(SBL) approach. The latter is shown to be a correlation-aware method, and for
the underlying problem it is identified as a grid-based technique for
recovering a structured covariance matrix of the measurements. For the case
when the structured matrix is expressible as a sampled Toeplitz matrix, such as
when measurements are sampled in time or space at regular intervals, additional
constraints and reparameterization of the SBL objective leads to the proposed
structured matrix recovery technique based on MLE. The proposed optimization
problem is non-convex, and we propose a majorization-minimization based
iterative procedure to estimate the structured matrix; each iteration solves a
semidefinite program. We recover the parameter of interest in a gridless manner

matrices. For the general case of irregularly spaced time or spatial samples,
we propose an iterative SBL procedure that refines grid points to increase

up to $5,000\text{ km s$^{-1}$}$ due to anisotropic emission of gravitational
waves. E1821+643 is a recoiling supermassive black hole moving at $\sim
2,100\text{ km s$^{-1}$}$ along the line-of-sight relative to its host galaxy.
This suggests a recoil kick of $\sim 2,240\text{ km s$^{-1}$}$. Such a kick is
powerful enough to eject E1821+643 from its $M_\text{gal}\sim 2 \times
10^{12}\text{ M}_{\odot}$ host galaxy. In this work, we address the question:
what are the likely properties of the progenitor binary that formed E1821+643?
Using astrophysically motivated priors, we infer that E1821+643 was likely
formed from a binary black hole system with masses of $m_1\sim
1.9^{+5.0}_{-3.8}\times 10^{9}\text{ M}_{\odot}$, $m_2\sim 8.1^{+3.9}_{-3.2}
\times 10^{8}\text{ M}_{\odot}$ (90\% credible intervals). The black holes in
this binary were likely to be spinning rapidly with dimensionless spin
magnitudes of ${\chi}_1 = 0.87^{+0.11}_{-0.26}$, ${\chi}_2 =
0.77^{+0.19}_{-0.37}$. Such a high recoil velocity is impossible for spins
aligned to the orbital angular momentum axis. This suggest that E1821+643
merged in hot gas, which is thought to provide an environment where spin
alignment from accretion proceeds slowly relative to the merger timescale. We
infer that E1821+643 is likely to be rapidly rotating with dimensionless spin
${\chi} = 0.92\pm0.04$. A $2.6 \times 10^9 \text{ M}_{\odot}$ black hole,
recoiling from a gas-rich environment at $v\sim 2,240\text{ km s$^{-1}$}$ is
likely to persist as an active galactic nuclei for $\sim 860$ Myr, in which

In this case, we propose Multi-agent Deep Covering Option Discovery, which
constructs the multi-agent options through minimizing the expected cover time
of the multiple agents' joint state space. Also, we propose a novel framework
to adopt the multi-agent options in the MARL process. In practice, a
multi-agent task can usually be divided into some sub-tasks, each of which can
be completed by a sub-group of the agents. Therefore, our algorithm framework
first leverages an attention mechanism to find collaborative agent sub-groups
that would benefit most from coordinated actions. Then, a hierarchical
algorithm, namely HA-MSAC, is developed to learn the multi-agent options for
each sub-group to complete their sub-tasks first, and then to integrate them
through a high-level policy as the solution of the whole task. This
hierarchical option construction allows our framework to strike a balance
between scalability and effective collaboration among the agents. The
evaluation based on multi-agent collaborative tasks shows that the proposed
algorithm can effectively capture the agent interactions with the attention
mechanism, successfully identify multi-agent options, and significantly
outperforms prior works using single-agent options or no options, in terms of
both faster exploration and higher task rewards.

be tied to the range of values sampled in their training data. Large
transformer-based language models have pushed the boundaries on how well neural
networks can solve previously unseen problems, but their complexity and lack of
clarity about the relevant content in their training data obfuscates how they
achieve such robustness. As a step toward understanding how transformer-based

trained with examples from a known distribution. Using a reasoning task based
on the puzzle Sudoku, we show that OODG can occur on a complex problem if the
training set includes examples sampled from the whole distribution of simpler
component tasks. Successful generalization depends on carefully managing
positional alignment when absolute position encoding is used, but we find that
suppressing sensitivity to absolute positions overcomes this limitation. Taken

lakes on Earth, Titan's lakes are constantly subject to evaporation. This
process strongly affects the atmospheric methane abundance, the atmospheric
temperature, the lake mixed layer temperature, and the local wind circulation.
In this work we use a 2D atmospheric mesoscale model coupled to a slab lake
model to investigate the effect of solar and infrared radiation on the exchange
of energy and methane between Titan's lakes and atmosphere. The magnitude of
solar radiation reaching the surface of Titan through its thick atmosphere is
only a few W/m2. However, we find that this small energy input is important and
is comparable in absolute magnitude to the latent and sensible heat fluxes, as
suggested in the prior study by S. Rafkin and A. Soto (Icarus, 2020).
  The implementation of a gray radiative scheme in the model confirms the
importance of radiation when studying lakes at the surface of Titan. Solar and
infrared radiation change the energy balance of the system leading to an
enhancement of the methane evaporation rate, an increase of the equilibrium
lake temperature almost completely determined by its environment (humidity,
insolation, and background wind), and a strengthening of the local sea breeze,
which undergoes diurnal variations. The sea breeze efficiently transports
methane vapor horizontally, from the lake to the land, and vertically due to
rising motion along the sea breeze front and due to radiation-induced
turbulence over the land.

suggesting appropriate boundary conditions for the nonlinear Nwogu system on a
finite interval. Then, well-posedness is established, both in the weak and in
the classical sense, for a regularized Nwogu system in the context of an
initial-boundary value problem that describes the dynamics of water waves in a
basin with wall-boundary conditions. In addition, a new modified Galerkin
method is suggested for the numerical discretization of this regularized system

rejected due to undesired contents/formats or violating edit guidelines. Such a
scenario frustrates or demotivates users who would like to conduct good-quality
edits. Therefore, our research focuses on assisting SO users by offering them
suggestions on how to improve their editing of posts. First, we manually
investigate 764 (382 questions + 382 answers) rejected edits by rollbacks and
produce a catalog of 19 rejection reasons. Second, we extract 15 texts and
user-based features to capture those rejection reasons. Third, we develop four
machine learning models using those features. Our best-performing model can
predict rejected edits with 69.1% precision, 71.2% recall, 70.1% F1-score, and
69.8% overall accuracy. Fourth, we introduce an online tool named EditEx that
works with the SO edit system. EditEx can assist users while editing posts by
suggesting the potential causes of rejections. We recruit 20 participants to
assess the effectiveness of EditEx. Half of the participants (i.e., treatment

optimization program, which is typically hard to solve. To this end, we design
a two-staged approach that utilizes a greedy algorithm to optimize the joint
localization and target tracking performance and applies control barrier
functions to ensure safety constraints, i.e., maintaining connectivity of the
robot team and preventing inter-robot collisions. Simulated Gazebo experiments
verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We further compare our
greedy algorithm to a non-linear optimization solver and a random algorithm, in
terms of the joint localization and tracking quality as well as the computation
time. The results demonstrate that our greedy algorithm achieves high task
quality and runs efficiently.

  High-Resolution Image Compression",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural-network-based approaches recently emerged in the field of data
compression and have already led to significant progress in image compression,
especially in achieving a higher compression ratio. In the lossless image
compression scenario, however, existing methods often struggle to learn a
probability model of full-size high-resolution images due to the limitation of
the computation source. The current strategy is to crop high-resolution images
into multiple non-overlapping patches and process them independently. This
strategy ignores long-term dependencies beyond patches, thus limiting modeling
performance. To address this problem, we propose a hierarchical latent variable
model with a global context to capture the long-term dependencies of
high-resolution images. Besides the latent variable unique to each patch, we
introduce shared latent variables between patches to construct the global
context. The shared latent variables are extracted by a self-supervised
clustering module inside the model's encoder. This clustering module assigns
each patch the confidence that it belongs to any cluster. Later, shared latent
variables are learned according to latent variables of patches and their
confidence, which reflects the similarity of patches in the same cluster and
benefits the global context modeling. Experimental results show that our global
context model improves compression ratio compared to the engineered codecs and
deep learning models on three benchmark high-resolution image datasets, DIV2K,
CLIC.pro, and CLIC.mobile.

investigate the ability of clustering approaches in distinguishing between
depression and dementia from human speech. We introduce a novel aggregated

Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, healthy control, and
depression. We compare linear and non-linear clustering approaches and show
that non-linear clustering techniques distinguish better between distinct

differentiating symptoms between dementia and depression are acoustic
abnormality, repetitiveness (or circularity) of speech, word finding
difficulty, coherence impairment, and differences in lexical complexity and

framework of the SU(3) chiral quark-soliton model, considering the effects of
flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking, and the corresponding energy-momentum tensor
distributions. We examine the effects of flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking to the
mass, angular momentum, pressure, and shear force distributions of the baryon
octet. We first find that a heavier baryon is energetically more compact than a
lighter one. For the spin distributions of the baryon octet, they are properly
normalized to their spins and are decomposed into the flavor-singlet axial
charge and the orbital angular momentum even when the flavor SU(3) symmetry is
broken. While the effects of the flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking differently
contribute to the angular momentum distributions for the octet baryons, they
are found to be rather small. The spin and orbital angular momentum almost
equally contribute to the angular momentum distributions for the octet baryons.
We also estimate the effects of the flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking to the
pressure and shear force distributions. Interestingly, even if we include the
effects of the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking, the shear force distributions
are kept to be positive over $r$. It indicates that the Polyakov & Schweitzer
local stability condition is kept to be intact with the flavor SU(3) symmetry
broken. Lastly, we discuss how much the gravitational form factors vary with
the effects of flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking considered.

effects of propagation of gamma rays through the intergalactic medium can be
used for the measurement of the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF). We search
for delayed GeV emission from the hard-spectrum TeV blazar 1ES 0229+200 with
the goal to detect or constrain the IGMF-dependent secondary flux generated
during the propagation of TeV gamma rays through the intergalactic medium. We
analyze the most recent MAGIC observations over a 5 year time span and
complement them with historic data of the H.E.S.S. and VERITAS telescopes along
with a 12-year long exposure of the Fermi/LAT telescope. We use them to trace
source evolution in the GeV-TeV band over one-and-a-half decade in time. We use
Monte Carlo simulations to predict the delayed secondary gamma-ray flux,
modulated by the source variability, as revealed by TeV-band observations. We
then compare these predictions for various assumed IGMF strengths to all
available measurements of the gamma-ray flux evolution. We find that the source
flux in the energy range above 200 GeV experiences variations around its
average on the 14 years time span of observations. No evidence for the flux
variability is found in 1-100 GeV energy range accessible to Fermi/LAT.
Non-detection of variability due to delayed emission from electromagnetic
cascade developing in the intergalactic medium imposes a lower bound of
B>1.8e-17 G for long correlation length IGMF and B>1e-14 G for an IGMF of the
cosmological origin. Though weaker than the one previously derived from the
analysis of Fermi/LAT data, this bound is more robust, being based on a
conservative intrinsic source spectrum estimate and accounting for the details
of source variability in the TeV energy band. We discuss implications of this
bound for cosmological magnetic fields which might explain the baryon asymmetry
of the Universe.

Here we present an alternative view of the redshift drift which captures the
expansion of the universe in single epoch observations of the multiple images

with an associated time delay of order decades, simultaneous photons arriving
at a detector would have been emitted decades earlier in one image compared to
another, leading to an instantaneous redshift difference between the images. We
also investigate the effect of peculiar velocities on the redshift difference
in the observed images. Whilst still requiring the observational power of the
next generation of telescopes and instruments, the advantage of such a single
epoch detection over other redshift drift measurements is that it will be less
susceptible to systematic effects that result from requiring instrument
stability over decade-long campaigns.

developing field of artificial intelligence research focused on climate change
applications. The climate change AI (CCAI) community works on a diverse,
challenging set of problems which often involve physics-constrained ML or
heterogeneous spatiotemporal data. It would be desirable to use automated
machine learning (AutoML) techniques to automatically find high-performing
architectures and hyperparameters for a given dataset. In this work, we
benchmark popular AutoML libraries on three high-leverage CCAI applications:
climate modeling, wind power forecasting, and catalyst discovery. We find that
out-of-the-box AutoML libraries currently fail to meaningfully surpass the
performance of human-designed CCAI models. However, we also identify a few key
weaknesses, which stem from the fact that most AutoML techniques are tailored
to computer vision and NLP applications. For example, while dozens of search
spaces have been designed for image and language data, none have been designed
for spatiotemporal data. Addressing these key weaknesses can lead to the
discovery of novel architectures that yield substantial performance gains
across numerous CCAI applications. Therefore, we present a call to action to
the AutoML community, since there are a number of concrete, promising
directions for future work in the space of AutoML for CCAI. We release our code

algorithm using deep neural network to successfully surpass human level
performance in a number of Atari learning environments. However, divergent and
unstable behaviour have been long standing issues in DQNs. The unstable
behaviour is often characterised by overestimation in the $Q$-values, commonly
referred to as the overestimation bias. To address the overestimation bias and
the divergent behaviour, a number of heuristic extensions have been proposed.
Notably, multi-step updates have been shown to drastically reduce unstable
behaviour while improving agent's training performance. However, agents are
often highly sensitive to the selection of the multi-step update horizon ($n$),
and our empirical experiments show that a poorly chosen static value for $n$
can in many cases lead to worse performance than single-step DQN. Inspired by
the success of $n$-step DQN and the effects that multi-step updates have on
overestimation bias, this paper proposes a new algorithm that we call `Elastic
Step DQN' (ES-DQN). It dynamically varies the step size horizon in multi-step
updates based on the similarity of states visited. Our empirical evaluation
shows that ES-DQN out-performs $n$-step with fixed $n$ updates, Double DQN and
Average DQN in several OpenAI Gym environments while at the same time
alleviating the overestimation bias.

using the randomized benchmarking method. Moreover, this scheme can be utilized

to the realistic systems with a large number of interacting spins, we employ an

the method for describing spin polarization dynamics is benchmarked by the
exact numerics for a small lattice, where the accuracy of the bosonic

results prove the efficiency of the active driving method when the central spin
interaction with the spin bath is long range and the inter-spin interactions in
the bath spins is large enough. The method is then applied to the realistic

the cut feeling in the mouth mapping and the lack of skin highlights. The
morphed region is blurry compared to the surrounding face. A Keypoint Based
Enhancement (KPBE) method is proposed for audio driven free view talking head
synthesis to improve the naturalness of the generated video. Firstly, existing
methods were used as the backend to synthesize intermediate results. Then we
used keypoint decomposition to extract video synthesis controlling parameters
from the backend output and the source image. After that, the controlling
parameters were composited to the source keypoints and the driving keypoints. A
motion field based method was used to generate the final image from the
keypoint representation. With keypoint representation, we overcame the cut
feeling in the mouth mapping and the lack of skin highlights. Experiments show
that our proposed enhancement method improved the quality of talking-head
videos in terms of mean opinion score.

Furthermore, variable intents are predicted first, then naturally embedded into
prompts to guide slot-value pairs inference from a semantic perspective.
Finally, we are inspired by prevalent multi-task learning to introduce an

many applications. However, the robots are required to form desired

Thus, it is challenging to determine whether the robots can pass through an
obstructed environment under formation constraints, especially in an
obstacle-rich environment. Furthermore, is there an optimal path for the
robots? To deal with the two problems, a novel graphbased motion planner is
proposed in this paper. A mapping between workspace and configuration space of
multi-mobile robot systems is first built, where valid configurations can be
acquired to satisfy both formation constraints and collision avoidance. Then,
an undirected graph is generated by verifying connectivity between valid
configurations. The breadth-first search method is employed to answer the
question of whether there is a feasible path on the graph. Finally, an optimal
path will be planned on the updated graph, considering the cost of path length
and formation preference. Simulation results show that the planner can be
applied to get optimal motions of robots under formation constraints in

perturbations in dark energy fluid generated at the phase transition of EDE as
isocurvature perturbations. Assuming that the isocurvature mode is
characterized by a power-law power spectrum and is uncorrelated with the
standard adiabatic mode, we calculate the CMB angular power spectra. By
comparing them to the Planck data using the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method, we
obtained zero-consistent values of the EDE parameters and
$H_0=67.56^{+0.65}_{-0.66}~\mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at
$68 \%$ CL. This $H_0$ value is almost the same as the Planck value in the
$\Lambda$CDM model, $H_0=67.36 \pm 0.54~\mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}
\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and there is still a $\sim 3.5 \sigma$ tension between the

fluctuations induced by the phase transition of the EDE is constrained to be
less than $1$--$2$ percent of the amplitude of the adiabatic mode. This is so
small that such non-standard fluctuations cannot appear in the CMB angular
spectra. In conclusion, the isocurvature fluctuations induced by our simplest

effects, such as the induction of electric currents, Ohmic heating, magnetic
drag, or the weakening of zonal winds have thus far been considered mainly in
the framework of a linear, steady-state model of induction. For Hot Jupiters
with an equilibrium temperature $T_{eq} > 1500$ K, the induction of atmospheric
magnetic fields is a runaway process that can only be stopped by non-linear

via the Lorentz force or the occurrence of magnetic instabilities. Moreover, we
discuss the possibility of self-excited atmospheric dynamos. Our results

bottleneck-based decomposition property, i.e., the DSO problem can be
decomposed into multiple single bottleneck problems. Subsequently, we obtain
the analytical solution by applying the theory of optimal transport to each
decomposed problem and derive optimal congestion prices to achieve the DSO
state. To derive the DUE solution, we prove the queue replacement principle
(QRP) that the time-varying optimal congestion prices are equal to the queueing
delay in the DUE state at every bottleneck. This principle enables us to derive
a closed-form DUE solution based on the DSO solution. Moreover, as an
application of the QRP, we prove that the equilibrium solution under various

flares. Using the soft X-ray spectra consisting of the continuum and
well-resolved line complexes of major elements like Mg, Si, and Fe, we
investigate the validity of the isothermal and multi-thermal assumptions on the
high temperature components of the flaring plasma. We show that the soft X-ray

inconsistent with isothermal models and are best fitted with double peaked
differential emission measure distributions where the temperature of the hotter
component rises faster than that of the cooler component. The two distinct
temperature components observed in DEM models during the impulsive phase of the
flares suggest the presence of the directly heated plasma in the corona and
evaporated plasma from the chromospheric footpoints. We also find that the
abundances of low FIP elements Mg, Si, and Fe reduces from near coronal to near
photospheric values during the rising phase of the flare and recovers back to
coronal values during decay phase, which is also consistent with the
chromospheric evaporation scenario.

QDs that are connected both in series and in parallel. Moreover, we show that
the additional gates enable differential tuning of the QDs in the nanojunction,

the occurrence of mid-infrared localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in

that the mid-infrared LSPR can be further enhanced and spectrally extended to

The rainbow Tur\'an number $ex^*(n,F)$ of a graph $F$ is the maximum possible
number of edges in a properly edge-colored $n$-vertex graph with no rainbow
copy of $F$. The study of rainbow Tur\'an numbers was introduced by Keevash,
Mubayi, Sudakov, and Verstra\""ete in 2007.
  In this paper we focus on $ex^*(n,P_5)$. While several recent papers have
investigated rainbow Tur\'an numbers for $\ell$-edge paths $P_{\ell}$, exact
results have only been obtained for $\ell < 5$, and $P_5$ represents one of the
smallest cases left open in rainbow Tur\'{a}n theory. In this paper, we prove
that $ex^*(n,P_5) \leq \frac{5n}{2}$. Combined with a lower-bound construction
due to Johnston and Rombach, this result shows that $ex^*(n,P_5) = \frac{5n}{2}
$ when $n$ is divisible by $16$, thereby settling the question asymptotically
for all $n$. In addition, this result strengthens the conjecture that
$ex^*(n,P_{\ell}) = \frac{\ell}{2}n + O(1)$ for all $\ell \geq 3$.

parameters, the pure MnSi phase of polycrystalline and textured nature as well
as the mixed phase of MnSi and MnSi1.7 are obtained. Surprisingly, all these

temperature is likely independent of the structural parameters within our

observed for all samples, which can tentatively be attributed to slight Mn
excess from stoichiometry, leading to the increased Curie temperature.

target-invariant syntactic expression patterns as transferable knowledge.
Specifically, we first augment the data by masking the topic words of

target, we encode the raw texts as target-specific features. Finally, we adopt
an attention mechanism, which combines syntactic expression patterns with
target-specific features to obtain enhanced features for predicting previously
unseen targets. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms competitive

  Human Activity Recognition","Accepted to IJCB 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automated Human Activity Recognition has long been a problem of great
interest in human-centered and ubiquitous computing. In the last years, a
plethora of supervised learning algorithms based on deep neural networks has
been suggested to address this problem using various modalities. While every
modality has its own limitations, there is one common challenge. Namely,
supervised learning requires vast amounts of annotated data which is
practically hard to collect. In this paper, we benefit from the self-supervised
learning paradigm (SSL) that is typically used to learn deep feature
representations from unlabeled data. Moreover, we upgrade a contrastive SSL
framework, namely SimCLR, widely used in various applications by introducing a
temporal feature alignment procedure for Human Activity Recognition.
Specifically, we propose integrating a dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm in
a latent space to force features to be aligned in a temporal dimension.
Extensive experiments have been conducted for the unimodal scenario with
inertial modality as well as in multimodal settings using inertial and skeleton
data. According to the obtained results, the proposed approach has a great
potential in learning robust feature representations compared to the recent SSL
baselines, and clearly outperforms supervised models in semi-supervised
learning. The code for the unimodal case is available via the following link:

large there is significant attenuation of one of the focussing peaks, which is
conventionally associated with a change in the spin polarisation. We instead
show that in hole systems with a $k^3$ spin-orbit interaction, this peak
suppression is due to a change in the scattering of one spin state, not a
change in spin polarisation. We also show that the change in scattering length
extracted from magnetic focussing is consistent with results obtained from
measurements of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. This result suggests that
scattering must be considered when relating focussing peak amplitude to spin
polarisation in hole systems

theoretical analysis and simulations, we develop and validate a mechanistic

that resonantly alternating helical waves enable both tangle formation and

arrangement, the SIE increases dramatically. We also show how molecular shape
impacts the SIE. Two and three dimensional shapes show an even greater SIE
stemming mainly from the exchange functional with some error compensation from
the one-electron error, which we previously defined [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.
22, 15805 (2020)]. Most tested geometries are affected by the functional error,
while some suffer from the density error. For the latter we establish a
potential connection with electrons being unequally delocalized by the DFT
methods. We also show how the the SIE increases if electrons occupy
higher-lying atomic orbitals; seemingly one-electron SIE free methods in a
ground are no longer SIE free in excited states, which is an important insight
for some popular, non-empirical DFAs. We conclude that the erratic behavior of
the SIE in even the simplest geometries shows that robust density functional
approximations are needed. Our test systems can be used as a future benchmark
or contribute towards DFT development.

this work, we focus on advection-diffusion problems with parameter-dependent

to combine stochastic collocation on the parameter domain with off-the-shelf
adaptive timestepping algorithms with local error control. This is a
non-intrusive strategy that builds a polynomial-based surrogate that is adapted
sequentially in time. The algorithm is driven by a so-called hierarchical
estimator for the parametric error and balances this against an estimate for
the global timestepping error which is derived from a scaling argument.

potential benefits of including a heat pump in the thermal management system

optimality in time, energy, or their trade-off. An optimal control problem is
formulated, in which the objective function includes the energy delivered by
the charger(s), and the total charging time including the actual charging time
and the detour time to and from the charging stop. To reduce the computational
complexity, the formulated problem is then transformed into a hybrid dynamical
system, where charging dynamics are modelled in the domain of normalized
charging time. Driving dynamics can be modelled in either of the trip time or
travel distance domains, as the vehicle speed is assumed to be known a priori,
and the vehicle is only stopping at charging locations. Within the hybrid
dynamical system, a binary variable is introduced for each charging location,
in order to decide to use or skip a charger. This problem is solved
numerically, and simulations are performed to evaluate the performance in terms
of energy efficiency and time. The simulation results indicate that the time
required for charging and total energy consumption are reduced up to 30.6% and
19.4%, respectively, by applying the proposed algorithm.

valid parameter space of models both in the case of a discovery of dark matter

dark matter relic density require technically demanding precision calculations,
which were so far limited in their automation due to challenges in the
treatment of infrared divergences appearing in higher order calculations. In
particular, massive initial states need to be considered in early Universe
computations, so that the known dipole subtraction methods could not be
directly exploited. We therefore provide a full generalization of the dipole
subtraction method by Catani and Seymour to supersymmetric (SUSY) QCD with
massive initial states. All dipole splitting functions and their integrated
counterparts are given explicitly for four different dimensional schemes. To
showcase their application, we apply our results to dark matter
(co)annihilation processes in the context of the minimal supersymmetric
Standard Model. We also demonstrate the accuracy of the dipole method by
comparing our numerical results with those obtained with the phase space
slicing method. Our analytical results will facilitate future automation of
dark matter abundance calculations at next-to-leading order for both SUSY and
non-SUSY models.

Consider a setting where a

Each vertex $v$ has its own valuation of the proposal; we say that $v$ is
``happy'' if its valuation is positive (i.e., it expects to gain from adopting
the proposal) and ``sad'' if its valuation is negative. However, vertices do
not base their vote merely on their own valuation. Rather, a vertex $v$ is a
\emph{proponent} of the proposal if a majority of its neighbors are happy with
it and an \emph{opponent} in the opposite case. At the end of the vote, the
network collectively accepts the proposal whenever a majority of its vertices
are proponents. We study this problem on regular graphs with loops.
Specifically, we consider the class ${\mathcal G}_{n|d|h}$ of $d$-regular

forecasting the probability density evolution of stochastic dynamical systems.
The method is based on stochastic Koopman operator and extended dynamic mode
decomposition (EDMD). To approximate the finite-dimensional eigendecomposition
of the stochastic Koopman operator, EDMD is applied to the training data set
sampled from the stationary distribution of the underlying stochastic dynamical
system. The family of the Koopman operators form a semigroup, which is
generated by the infinitesimal generator of the stochastic dynamical system. A
significant connection between the generator and Fokker-Planck operator
provides a way to construct an orthonormal basis of a weighted Hilbert space. A
spectral decomposition of the probability density function is accomplished in
this weighted space. This approach is a data-driven method and used to predict
the probability density evolution and real-time moment estimation. In the limit
of the large number of snapshots and observables, the data-driven probability
density approximation converges to the Galerkin projection of the semigroup
solution of Fokker-Planck equation on a basis adapted to an invariant measure.
The proposed method shares the similar idea to diffusion forecast, but renders
more accurate probability density than the diffusion forecast does. A few
numerical examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the
data-driven probability density forecast.

Researchers have developed multiple mathematical models and computational

However, modeling attempts of airborne pandemic dynamics on the smallest scale,

this paper, we propose a novel attention-aware relation mixer (ARM) module for
person search, which exploits the global relation between different local
regions within RoI of a person and make it robust against various appearance
deformations and occlusion. The proposed ARM is composed of a relation mixer
block and a spatio-channel attention layer. The relation mixer block introduces
a spatially attended spatial mixing and a channel-wise attended channel mixing
for effectively capturing discriminative relation features within an RoI. These
discriminative relation features are further enriched by introducing a
spatio-channel attention where the foreground and background discriminability
is empowered in a joint spatio-channel space. Our ARM module is generic and it
does not rely on fine-grained supervision or topological assumptions, hence
being easily integrated into any Faster R-CNN based person search methods.
Comprehensive experiments are performed on two challenging benchmark datasets:
CUHKSYSU and PRW. Our PS-ARM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both

Our polarization values lie in the middle of the range of those reported for

change from event to event. We found no significant polarization difference
(<0.02 per cent) between a region of dark Mare and nearby bright uplands or
between the lunar limb and regions closer to the disk centre due to the

learning segmentation method based on Dynamic Pseudo Labels(IDPL) is proposed.
The whole process consists of 3 steps: Firstly, the instance-level pseudo label
dynamic generation module is proposed, which fuses the class matching
information in global classes and local instances, thus adaptively generating
the optimal threshold for each class, obtaining high-quality pseudo labels.
Secondly, the subdomain classifier module based on instance confidence is

self-attention is proposed. It uses multi-head self-attention to confront the
easy and difficult subdomains at the class level with the help of generated
high-quality pseudo labels, so as to focus on mining the features of difficult
categories in the high-entropy region of target domain images, which promotes
class-level conditional distribution alignment between the subdomains,
improving the segmentation performance of difficult categories. For the
difficult categories, the experimental results show that the performance of
IDPL is significantly improved compared with other latest mainstream methods.

open problem in quantum information theory. Here we introduce a systematic
approach that enables us to construct exactly those extreme channels that are

group. Innovative labeling of quantum channels by group representations enables
us to identify the subset of group-covariant channels whose elements are
group-covariant generalized-extreme channels. Furthermore, we exploit
essentials of group representation theory to introduce equivalence classes for
the labels and also partition the set of group-covariant channels. As a result
we show that it is enough to construct one representative of each partition. We
construct Kraus operators for group-covariant generalized-extreme channels by
solving systems of linear and quadratic equations for all candidates satisfying
the necessary condition for being group-covariant generalized-extreme channels.
Deciding whether these constructed instances are extreme or quasi-extreme is
accomplished by solving system of linear equations. We formalize the problem of
constructing and classifying group-covariant generalized extreme channels,

Correct (PAC) Security. PAC security characterizes the information-theoretic
hardness to recover sensitive data given arbitrary information

cryptographic definition and Differential Privacy (DP), which consider the
adversarial (input-independent) worst case, PAC security is a simulatable
metric that quantifies the instance-based impossibility of inference. A fully
automatic analysis and proof generation framework is proposed: security
parameters can be produced with arbitrarily high confidence via Monte-Carlo
simulation for any black-box data processing oracle. This appealing automation
property enables analysis of complicated data processing, where the worst-case
proof in the classic privacy regime could be loose or even intractable.
Moreover, we show that the produced PAC security guarantees enjoy simple
composition bounds and the automatic analysis framework can be implemented in
an online fashion to analyze the composite PAC security loss even under
correlated randomness. On the utility side, the magnitude of (necessary)
perturbation required in PAC security is not lower bounded by
$\Theta(\sqrt{d})$ for a $d$-dimensional release but could be O(1) for many

the Shapiro delay. We constrain the pulsar mass to 1.20$^{+0.28}_{-0.29}\rm

expectation for the masses obtained using $\dot{\omega}$ and $h_3$. The excess
represents a limit on the emission of dipolar GWs from this system. This
results in a limit on the difference in effective scalar couplings for the
pulsar and companion (predicted by scalar-tensor theories of gravity; STTs) of
$|\alpha_{\rm p}-\alpha_{\rm c}| < 4.8 \times 10^{-3}$, which does not yield a
competitive test for STTs. However, our simulations of future campaigns of this
system show that by 2032, the precision of $\dot{P}_{\rm b}$ and $\dot{\omega}$
will allow for much more precise masses and much tighter constraints on the
orbital decay contribution from dipolar GWs, resulting in $|\alpha_{\rm

system will place on the $\{\alpha_0,\beta_0\}$ parameters of DEF gravity by

PSR J1952+2630 will not be limited in its mass measurement and has the
potential to place even more restrictive limits on DEF gravity in the future.
Further improvements to this test will likely be limited by uncertainties in
the kinematic contributions to $\dot{P}_{\rm b}$ due to lack of precise

calculate the relevant strong coupling constants, two possible interpolating
currents with spin-parity $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^{-}$ are used. Though the chosen

$J^P=\frac{1}{2}^{-}$, they couple to both the positive and negative parity

$\Gamma(\widetilde{P}_{csss} \rightarrow J/\psi \Omega^-)=316.4\pm

is attractive as it removes the need for expert knowledge or pre-solved

strategies, from stochastic sampling and beam-search to explicit fine-tuning.
In this paper, we argue for the benefits of learning a population of
complementary policies, which can be simultaneously rolled out at inference. To
this end, we introduce Poppy, a simple theoretically grounded training
procedure for populations. Instead of relying on a predefined or hand-crafted
notion of diversity, Poppy induces an unsupervised specialization targeted
solely at maximizing the performance of the population. We show that Poppy
produces a set of complementary policies, and obtains state-of-the-art RL

absence of prior knowledge often in a non-desired way. Finding an optimal
objective definition then requires operators to iterate over many possible
objective weights and definitions, a process that can take many times longer
than the optimization itself. A more versatile approach is multi-objective
optimization, which establishes the trade-off curve or Pareto front between
objectives. Here we present the first results on multi-objective Bayesian

multi-objective optimization reaches comparable performance to its
single-objective counterparts while allowing for instant evaluation of entirely
new objectives. This dramatically reduces the time required to find appropriate
objective definitions for new problems. Additionally, our multi-objective,
multi-fidelity method reduces the time required for an optimization run by an
order of magnitude. It does so by dynamically choosing simulation resolution

the Pareto-optimal solutions from fast low-resolution runs. The techniques
demonstrated in this paper can easily be translated into many different

We leverage this control of adhesion to optimize the vdW heterostructure

intermediate reasoning steps. Providing these steps for prompting
demonstrations is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. CoT prompting has
two major paradigms. One leverages a simple prompt like ""Let's think step by
step"" to facilitate step-by-step thinking before answering a question. The
other uses a few manual demonstrations one by one, each composed of a question
and a reasoning chain that leads to an answer. The superior performance of the
second paradigm hinges on the hand-crafting of task-specific demonstrations one
by one. We show that such manual efforts may be eliminated by leveraging LLMs
with the ""Let's think step by step"" prompt to generate reasoning chains for
demonstrations one by one, i.e., let's think not just step by step, but also
one by one. However, these generated chains often come with mistakes. To
mitigate the effect of such mistakes, we find that diversity matters for
automatically constructing demonstrations. We propose an automatic CoT
prompting method: Auto-CoT. It samples questions with diversity and generates
reasoning chains to construct demonstrations. On ten public benchmark reasoning
tasks with GPT-3, Auto-CoT consistently matches or exceeds the performance of
the CoT paradigm that requires manual designs of demonstrations. Code is

formalized in terms of the expected present value of future dividends. That
criterion disregards a potential, explicit demand for stability of dividends.
In particular, within actuarial risk theory, maximization of future dividends
have been intensively studied as the so-called de Finetti problem. However,
there the optimal strategies typically become so-called barrier strategies.
These are far from stable and suboptimal affine dividend strategies have
therefore received attention recently. In contrast, in the class of
linear-quadratic problems a demand for stability if explicitly stressed. These
have most often been studied in diffusion models different from the actuarial
risk models. We bridge the gap between these patterns of thinking by deriving
optimal affine dividend strategies under a linear-quadratic criterion for a
general L\'evy process. We characterize the value function by the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, solve it, and compare the objective and the
optimal controls to the classical objective of maximizing expected present
value of future dividends. Thereby we provide a framework within which
stability of dividends from a risky business, as e.g. in classical risk theory,
is explicitly demanded and explicitly obtained.

fine-tuned in the pre-trained model (less than a half). Crucial to the success
of PCAE is the proposed broadcasting label fusion network for navigating the
global latent code to a specified local and confined space. Visualization of
the local latent prior well confirms the primary devotion in hidden space of
the proposed model. Moreover, extensive experiments across five related
generation tasks (from 2 conditions up to 10 conditions) on both RNN- based and
pre-trained BART [26] based auto-encoders reveal the high capability of PCAE,
which enables generation that is highly manipulable, syntactically diverse and
time-saving with minimum labeled samples. We will release our code at

into tens-of-wavelength, the optical modes quantize in three-dimensional
momentum space, and each of them directionally radiates towards the far-field.
Further utilizing the luminescence spectrum shifting effect under current
injection, we consecutively select a sequence of modes into lasing action and
show the laser maintaining in single mode operation with linewidths at a
minimum of $1.8$ MHz and emitting power of $\sim$ ten milliwatts, and we
demonstrate fast beam steering across a range of $3.2^\circ \times 4^\circ$ in

novel meta-learning style approach that models network weights as a sum of
low-rank and sparse matrices. This captures common information from multiple

user-specific idiosyncrasies. Furthermore, the framework is up to two orders of

user-specific finetuning of model. We then study the framework in the linear

propose an alternating minimization method with iterative hard thresholding --
AMHT-LRS -- to learn the low-rank and sparse part. For the realizable, Gaussian

sample of 24 Seyfert (Sy) galaxies (BCS40 sample) using high angular resolution
infrared data and various torus models: smooth, clumpy and two-phase torus

and disc+wind models provide best fits for a comparable number of galaxies,
8/24 (33.3%) and 9/24 (37.5%), respectively. We find that the best-fitted

X-ray (unobscured/obscured) and/or optical (Sy1/Sy2) classification. In
particular, smooth, clumpy and two-phase torus models best reproduce the
infrared (IR) emission of AGN with relatively high hydrogen column density
(median value of log (NH)=23.5+-0.8; i.e. Sy2). However, clumpy disc+wind
models provide the best fits to the nuclear IR spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of Sy1/1.8/1.9 (median value of log (NH)=21.0+-1.0), specifically in the
near-IR (NIR) range. The success of the disc+wind models in fitting the NIR
emission of Sy1 galaxies is due to the combination of adding large graphite
grains to the dust composition and self-obscuration effects caused by the wind

having unfavourable (favourable) conditions, i.e. nuclear hydrogen column
density and Eddington ratio, for launching IR dusty polar outflows are
best-fitted with smooth, clumpy and two-phase torus (disk+wind) models

their spectral indices indicates significant differences, particularly in
low-mass galaxies. Semi-analytic spectral fitting of a full chemical evolution
model to these spectra confirms these differences, with low-mass satellites
having a shorter period of star formation and chemical enrichment typical of a
closed box, while central galaxies have more extended histories, with evidence
of on-going gas accretion over their lifetimes. The derived parameters for gas
infall timescale and wind strength suggest that low-mass satellite galaxies
have their hot halos of gas effectively removed, while central galaxies retain
a larger fraction of gas than isolated galaxies due to the deeper group
potential well in which they sit. S0 galaxies form a distinct subset within the

distribution and a novel means of optimizing the likelihood temperature to
improve importance sampling accuracy. We evaluate this approach on several
high-dimensional robot control tasks, matching the sample efficiency of prior
heuristic methods while also ensuring smoothness. Simulation results can be

We provide a catalog of artifacts. It lists their cause, resulting effects, and

topic discussions. Topic modeling are done on the textual contents of the
posts. We found 26 topics which we further categorized into 5 board categories.
We observed that developers discuss variety of pandas topics in SO related to
error and excepting handling, visualization, External support, dataframe, and
optimization. In addition, a trend chart is generated according to the
discussion of topics in a predefined time series. The finding of this paper can
provide a path to help the developers, educators and learners. For example,
beginner developers can learn most important topics in pandas which are
essential for develop any model. Educators can understand the topics which seem
hard to learners and can build different tutorials which can make that pandas

use it to adapt the polynomial degree for high-order discontinuous Galerkin
simulations of unsteady flows. The adaptation is local and anisotropic and
allows capturing relevant unsteady flow features while enhancing the accuracy
of time evolving functionals (e.g., lift, drag). To achieve an efficient and
unsteady truncation error-based $p$-adaptation scheme, we first revisit the
definition of the truncation error, studying the effect of the treatment of the
mass matrix arising from the temporal term. Secondly, we extend the
$\tau$-estimation strategy to unsteady problems. Finally, we present and
compare two adaptation strategies for unsteady problems: the dynamic and static
$p$-adaptation methods. In the first one (dynamic) the error is measured
periodically during a simulation and the polynomial degree is adapted
immediately after every estimation procedure. In the second one (static) the
error is also measured periodically, but only one $p$-adaptation process is
performed after several estimation stages, using a combination of the periodic
error measures. The static $p$-adaptation strategy is suitable for
time-periodic flows, while the dynamic one can be generalized to any flow
evolution.
  We consider two test cases to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed
$p$-adaptation strategies. The first one considers the compressible Euler
equations to simulate the advection of a density pulse. The second one solves
the compressible Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the flow around a cylinder
at Re=100. The local and anisotropic adaptation enables significant reductions
in the number of degrees of freedom with respect to uniform refinement, leading
to speed-ups of up to $\times4.5$ for the Euler test case and $\times2.2$ for
the Navier-Stokes test case.

Using actual residential electricity consumption profile data for 720,000

influence aggregated peak consumption than electric vehicles. At the same time,
other socio-economic factors, such as occupancy, dwelling area and income, show
little impact. Comparing the extrapolation of a comprehensive rollout of heat
pumps or electric vehicles indicates that the most common consumer category
deploying heat pumps has 14% more maximum consumption during peak load hours,
46% more average consumption and twice the higher median compared to households
owning an electric vehicle. Electric vehicle show already flexibility with

heat pumps are mostly baseload. The detailed and holistic outcomes of this

accomplished by the use of an asymptotic expansion of the grand potential,

that the singularity structure of this expansion is directly interwoven with
the phase structure of the system: In the non-condensation phase the expansion
has a form that resembles usual heat kernel expansions. By this, thermodynamic
observables are directly calculable. In contrast, the expansion exhibits a
singularity of infinite order above a critical density and a renormalization of
the chemical potential is needed to ensure well-defined thermodynamic
observables. Furthermore, the renormalization procedure forces the system to
exhibit condensation. In addition, we show that characteristic features of the
thermodynamic limit, like the critical density or the internal energy, are
entirely encoded in the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion.

This condition is tested on small-length codes, and then extended to
medium-length codes. The puncturing operations we apply do not influence the
satisfaction of the row-column constraint, assuring that a wide range of code
rates can be obtained. We can reach code rates remarkably higher than those
obtainable by the original simplex code, and the price in terms of minimum
distance turns out to be relatively small, leading to interesting trade-offs in
the resulting asymptotic coding gain.

importance for light manipulation which resulted in numerous applications
ranging from subdiffraction light guiding to switchable nanolasers. In spite of
recent advances in the field, achieving continuous tunability of optical
anisotropy remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we present a solution to the
problem through chemical alteration of the ratio of halogen atoms (X = Br or
Cl) in single-crystal CsPbX$_3$ halide perovskites. It turns out that the
anisotropy originates from an excitonic resonance in the perovskite, which
spectral position and strength are determined by the halogens composition. As a
result, we manage to continually modify the optical anisotropy by 0.14. We also
discover that the halide perovskite can demonstrate optical anisotropy up to
0.6 in the visible range -- the largest value among non-van der Waals
materials. Moreover, our results reveal that this anisotropy could be in-plane
and out-of-plane, depending on perovskite shape -- rectangular and square.
Hence, it can serve as an additional degree of freedom for anisotropy
manipulation. As a practical demonstration, we created perovskite anisotropic
nanowaveguides and show a significant impact of anisotropy on high-order
guiding modes. These findings pave the way for halide perovskites as a
next-generation platform for tunable anisotropic photonics.

motion and its spin, and is ubiquitous in condensed matter systems. The
interplay of SOC with superconductivity has attracted significant interest over
the past decade and understanding has substantially progressed, both
experimentally and theoretically. Even with well-understood materials,
conventional $s$-wave superconducting hybrid structures with SOC provide a
platform for realizing exotic phenomena and counterparts in the normal state.
Understanding the emergent phenomena in such systems is an important aim in
condensed matter physics. One such area relates to the generation and interplay
of spin-polarized spin-triplet Cooper pairs in superconducting structures with
magnetic interfaces. It is established that certain forms of magnetic
inhomogeneity at an $s$-wave superconductor interface with a ferromagnet can
transform spin-singlet Cooper pairs into a spin-polarized spin-triplet Cooper
pairs, enabling transformative concepts for cryogenic computing. Recently,
theory and experiments have demonstrated singlet-to-triplet pair conversion via
SOC in $s$-wave superconducting structures with or without magnetic layers.
Moreover, the spin-dependent properties of quasiparticles and their
non-equilibrium behavior also change in the presence of SOC. These
breakthroughs create the potential for energy-efficient control of static and
dynamic spin phenomena in superconducting structures and devices. This article
reviews progress in superconducting spintronics with a focus on the coupling of
superconductivity and SOC in hybrid structures and devices, and outlines
directions that are critical for future device development and fundamental
understanding.

for knowledge representation and reasoning. There are plenty of results
dedicated to studying the hardness of (fragments of) ASP. So far, these studies
resulted in characterizations in terms of computational complexity as well as
in fine-grained insights presented in form of dichotomy-style results, lower
bounds when translating to other formalisms like propositional satisfiability
(SAT), and even detailed parameterized complexity landscapes. A generic
parameter in parameterized complexity originating from graph theory is the
so-called treewidth, which in a sense captures structural density of a program.
Recently, there was an increase in the number of treewidth-based solvers
related to SAT. While there are translations from (normal) ASP to SAT, no
reduction that preserves treewidth or at least keeps track of the treewidth
increase is known. In this paper we propose a novel reduction from normal ASP
to SAT that is aware of the treewidth, and guarantees that a slight increase of
treewidth is indeed sufficient. Further, we show a new result establishing
that, when considering treewidth, already the fragment of normal ASP is
slightly harder than SAT (under reasonable assumptions in computational
complexity). This also confirms that our reduction probably cannot be
significantly improved and that the slight increase of treewidth is
unavoidable. Finally, we present an empirical study of our novel reduction from
normal ASP to SAT, where we compare treewidth upper bounds that are obtained
via known decomposition heuristics. Overall, our reduction works better with
these heuristics than existing translations.

investing into renewable generation. The agents interact through the market

Model (HMM) with the only two assumptions that the transition matrix of the

emission distributions are linearly independent. We introduce a new procedure
for estimating this order by investigating the rank of some well-chosen
integral operator which relies on the distribution of a pair of consecutive
observations. This method circumvents the usual limits of the spectral method
when it is used for estimating the order of an HMM: it avoids the choice of the
basis functions; it does not require any knowledge of an upper-bound on the
order of the HMM (for the spectral method, such an upper-bound is defined by
the number of basis functions); it permits to easily handle different types of
data (including continuous data, circular data or multivariate continuous data)
with a suitable choice of kernel. The method relies on the fact that the order
of the HMM can be identified from the distribution of a pair of consecutive
observations and that this order is equal to the rank of some integral operator
(\emph{i.e.} the number of its singular values that are non-zero). Since only
the empirical counter-part of the singular values of the operator can be
obtained, we propose a data-driven thresholding procedure. An upper-bound on
the probability of overestimating the order of the HMM is established.
Moreover, sufficient conditions on the bandwidth used for kernel density
estimation and on the threshold are stated to obtain the consistency of the
estimator of the order of the HMM. The procedure is easily implemented since
the values of all the tuning parameters are determined by the sample size.

from straightforward. First, a physical model for dust collection considering a
Poisson process is formulated. Second, it is shown that dust on hyperbolic
orbits is responsible for the majority of dust detections with Solar Orbiter's
Radio and Plasma Waves (SolO/RPW). Third, the model for dust counts is fitted
to SolO/RPW data and parameters of the dust are inferred, namely: radial
velocity, hyperbolic meteoroids predominance, and solar radiation pressure to
gravity ratio as well as uncertainties of these. Non-parametric model fitting
is used to get the difference between inbound and outbound detection rate and
dust radial velocity is thus estimated. A hierarchical Bayesian model is
formulated and applied to available SolO/RPW data. The model uses the
methodology of Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation, estimating parameters
of dust and their uncertainties. SolO/RPW dust observations can be modelled as
a Poisson process in a Bayesian framework and observations up to this date are
consistent with the hyperbolic dust model with an additional background
component. Analysis suggests a radial velocity of the hyperbolic component
around $(63 \pm 7) \mathrm{km/s}$ with the predominance of hyperbolic dust
about $(78 \pm 4) \%$. The results are consistent with hyperbolic meteoroids
originating between $0.02 \mathrm{AU}$ and $0.1 \mathrm{AU}$ and showing
substantial deceleration, which implies effective solar radiation pressure to
gravity ratio $\gtrsim 0.5$. The flux of hyperbolic component at $1

ultra high dose rates (UHDR) through inter-track reaction-diffusion mechanism.
Methods: We calculate the time-evolution of particle track-structures using a
system of coupled reaction-diffusion equations on a random network designed for
molecular transport in porous and disordered media. The network is
representative of the intra- and inter-cellular diffusion channels in tissues.
Spatial cellular heterogeneities over the scale of track spacing have been
constructed by incorporating random fluctuations in the connectivity among
network sites. Results: We demonstrate the occurrence of phase separation among
the tracks as the complexity in intra- and inter-cellular structural increases.
At the weak limit of disorder, such as in water and normal tissue, neighboring
tracks melt into each other and form a percolated network of nonreactive
species. In contrast, at the strong limit of disorder, tracks evolve
individually like isolated islands with negligible inter-track overlap. Thus,
the spatio-temporal correlation among the chemical domains decreases as the
inter-cellular complexity of the tissue increases (e.g. from normal tissue to
fractal-type malignant tissue). Conclusions: The differential sparing of FLASH
UHDR in normal and tumor tissue may be explained by differences in inter- and
intra-cellular structural complexities between the tissue types. The structural
complexities of cancerous cells prevent clustering and chemical interaction of
tracks, whereas this interaction prevails and thus leads to sparing in normal
tissue.

electronic and thermal transport in nanoscale devices as well as for molecular
catalysis. The vibrational dynamics of <100 molecules are studied through
three-colour time-resolved coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (trCARS)
using plasmonic nanoantennas. This isolates molecular signals from four-wave
mixing (FWM), while using exceptionally low nanowatt powers to avoid molecular
damage via single-photon lock-in detection. FWM is found to be strongly
suppressed in nm-wide plasmonic gaps compared to plasmonic nanoparticles. The
ultrafast vibrational decay rates of biphenyl-4-thiol molecules are accelerated
ten-fold by a transient rise in local non-equilibrium temperature excited by
enhanced, pulsed optical fields within these plasmonic nanocavities. Separating
the contributions of vibrational population decay and dephasing carefully
explores the vibrational decay channels of these tightly confined molecules.
Such extreme plasmonic enhancement within nanogaps opens up prospects for
measuring single-molecule vibrationally-coupled dynamics and diverse molecular
optomechanics phenomena.

critical task to ensure the safety of all road users. Existing state-of-the-art
techniques in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for object detection and
segmentation help automate a huge chunk of this task given adequate annotated
data. However, annotating videos from scratch is cost-prohibitive. For
instance, it can take an annotator several days to annotate a 5-minute video
recorded at 30 FPS. Hence, we propose an automated labelling pipeline by
leveraging techniques like few-shot learning and out-of-distribution detection
to generate labels for road damage detection. In addition, our pipeline
includes a risk factor assessment for each damage by instance quantification to
prioritize locations for repairs which can lead to optimal deployment of road
maintenance machinery. We show that the AI models trained with these techniques
can not only generalize better to unseen real-world data with reduced
requirement for human annotation but also provide an estimate of maintenance
urgency, thereby leading to safer roads.

microscopic human driving behaviors. This work proposes a memory-augmented
Bayesian calibration approach, which leverages the Bayesian inference and
stochastic processes (i.e., Gaussian processes) to calibrate an unbiased
car-following model while extracting the serial correlations of residual. This
calibration approach is applied to the intelligent driver model (IDM) and
develops a novel model named MA-IDM. To evaluate the effectiveness of the
developed approach, three models with different hierarchies (i.e., pooled,
hierarchical, and unpooled) are tested. Experiments demonstrate that the MA-IDM
can estimate the noise level of unrelated errors by decoupling the serial
correlation of residuals. Furthermore, a stochastic simulation method is also
developed based on our Bayesian calibration approach, which can obtain unbiased
posterior motion states and generate anthropomorphic driving behaviors.
Simulation results indicate that the MA-IDM outperforms Bayesian IDM in
simulation accuracy and uncertainty quantification. With this Bayesian
approach, we can generate enormous but nonidentical driving behaviors by
sampling from the posteriors, which can help develop a realistic traffic
simulator.

from its constituent parts, is a hallmark of human language. At the same time,
many phrases are non-compositional, carrying a meaning beyond that of each part
in isolation. Representing both of these types of phrases is critical for
language understanding, but it is an open question whether modern language
models (LMs) learn to do so; in this work we examine this question. We first
formulate a problem of predicting the LM-internal representations of longer

parent phrase can be predicted with some accuracy given an affine
transformation of its children. While we would expect the predictive accuracy
to correlate with human judgments of semantic compositionality, we find this is
largely not the case, indicating that LMs may not accurately distinguish

wave phase speed (PS), which is a dominant contribution to solar coronal

energy flux (EF), it is necessary to calculate the filling factor (FF) and the
PS. In this study, the FF was determined by tracking the size and intensity of
the IRIS bright points (BPs). To estimate an accurate PS and EF, it is
necessary to know the chromosphere and transition region (TR) thickness and the
phase difference between the two desired levels. chromosphere and TR thickness
cannot be measured directly on the disc; This study is performed using spectral
data and calibrated based on Doppler velocities. As a result, the PSs in AR and
CH, as well as for IRIS BPs have been calculated using the cross-power wavelet
transform of Doppler velocities. Consequently, about CH, the PS mean values are
from 40 to 180 km/s at network and from 30 to 140 km/s at internetwork; And
about AR, are from 80 to 540 km/s at network and 70 to 220 km/s at

different frequencies. The results indicate that the network BPs have an

generalization and memorization. Yet, little is known about the mechanism by
which transformer LMs employ their memorization capacity. When does a model
decide to output a memorized phrase, and how is this phrase then retrieved from
memory? In this work, we offer the first methodological framework for probing
and characterizing recall of memorized sequences in transformer LMs. First, we
lay out criteria for detecting model inputs that trigger memory recall, and
propose idioms as inputs that typically fulfill these criteria. Next, we
construct a dataset of English idioms and use it to compare model behavior on
memorized vs. non-memorized inputs. Specifically, we analyze the internal
prediction construction process by interpreting the model's hidden
representations as a gradual refinement of the output probability distribution.
We find that across different model sizes and architectures, memorized
predictions are a two-step process: early layers promote the predicted token to
the top of the output distribution, and upper layers increase model confidence.
This suggests that memorized information is stored and retrieved in the early
layers of the network. Last, we demonstrate the utility of our methodology
beyond idioms in memorized factual statements. Overall, our work makes a first
step towards understanding memory recall, and provides a methodological basis

However, the optimal operation of flexible units in ADNs is highly complex,
which poses challenges for distribution system operators (DSOs) in aggregating
DER flexibility. For example, to maximise the provision of services, flexible
units must be strongly coordinated to manage network constraints, e.g., perform
power swaps. Furthermore, due to the nonlinearities of aggregated DER
flexibility provision, some units may need to rapidly change their outputs to
enable the services. To address these challenges, this paper brings together
exact AC optimal power flow (OPF) models and a cooperative game formulation and
presents a new framework for tracing, ranking, and valuation of aggregated DER

complex DER interactions into useful information for DSOs by ranking the
criticality of flexible units and performing flexibility valuation based on its
cost or economic surplus. Additionally, the framework proposes no-swap
constraints and a nonlinearity metric which can be used by DSOs to identify
unreliable operating regions with power swaps or rapid changes in flexible unit

advanced several areas of automated reasoning (AR). One of the directions in AR
is thus to apply SAT solvers to expressive formalisms such as first-order
logic, for which large corpora of general mathematical problems exist today.
This is possible due to Herbrand's theorem, which allows reduction of
first-order problems to propositional problems by instantiation. The core
challenge is choosing the right instances from the typically infinite Herbrand
universe. In this work, we develop the first machine learning system targeting
this task, addressing its combinatorial and invariance properties. In
particular, we develop a GNN2RNN architecture based on an invariant graph
neural network (GNN) that learns from problems and their solutions
independently of symbol names (addressing the abundance of skolems), combined
with a recurrent neural network (RNN) that proposes for each clause its
instantiations. The architecture is then trained on a corpus of mathematical
problems and their instantiation-based proofs, and its performance is evaluated
in several ways. We show that the trained system achieves high accuracy in
predicting the right instances, and that it is capable of solving many problems
by educated guessing when combined with a ground solver. To our knowledge, this
is the first convincing use of machine learning in synthesizing relevant
elements from arbitrary Herbrand universes.

common knowledge from a class-disjoint labelled dataset to another unlabelled
dataset and discovers new classes (clusters) within it. Many methods, as well
as elaborate training pipelines and appropriate objectives, have been proposed
and considerably boosted performance on NCD tasks. Despite all this, we find
that the existing methods do not sufficiently take advantage of the essence of
the NCD setting. To this end, in this paper, we propose to model both
inter-class and intra-class constraints in NCD based on the symmetric
Kullback-Leibler divergence (sKLD). Specifically, we propose an inter-class
sKLD constraint to effectively exploit the disjoint relationship between
labelled and unlabelled classes, enforcing the separability for different
classes in the embedding space. In addition, we present an intra-class sKLD
constraint to explicitly constrain the intra-relationship between a sample and
its augmentations and ensure the stability of the training process at the same
time. We conduct extensive experiments on the popular CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and
ImageNet benchmarks and successfully demonstrate that our method can establish
a new state of the art and can achieve significant performance improvements,
e.g., 3.5%/3.7% clustering accuracy improvements on CIFAR100-50 dataset split
under the task-aware/-agnostic evaluation protocol, over previous

identified, extracted FL intensity data was fit by mathematical models that
included tangential flow along the eye, evaporation, osmosis and FL intensity
of emission from the tear film. The mathematical models consisted of systems of
ordinary differential equations for the aqueous layer thickness, osmolarity,

data determined the mechanism(s) driving each instance of TBU and produced an
estimate of the osmolarity within TBU.
  Fits were produced for 467 instances of potential TBU from 15 non-DED

signal (consisting of both the line-of-sight (LOS) path and reflections from
multiple RISs) that originate from a single base station (BS) and is received
by a user equipment (UE). For a comprehensive Bayesian analysis, both near and
far field regimes are considered. The Bayesian analysis views both the location
of the RISs and previous information about the UE as {\em a priori} information
for UE localization. With outdated {\em a priori} information, the position and
orientation offsets of the RISs become parameters that need to be estimated and
fed back to the BS for correction. We first show that when the RIS elements
have a half wavelength spacing, this RIS orientation offset is a factor in the
pathloss of the RIS paths. Subsequently, we show through the Bayesian
equivalent FIM (EFIM) for the channel parameters that the RIS orientation
offset cannot be corrected when there is an unknown phase offset in the
received signal in the far-field regime. However, the corresponding EFIM for
the channel parameters in the received signal observed in the near-field shows
that this unknown phase offset does not hinder the estimation of the RIS
orientation offset when the UE has more than one receive antenna. Furthermore,
we use the EFIM for the UE location parameters to present bounds for UE
localization in the presence of RIS uncertainty. We rigorously show that
regardless of size and propagation regime, the RISs are only helpful for
localization when there is {\em a priori} information about the location of the
RISs. Finally, through numerical analysis of the EFIM and its smallest
eigenvalue, we demonstrate the loss in information when the far-field model is
{\em incorrectly} applied to the signals received at a UE experiencing
near-field propagation.

different types of mechanical behaviors that are separated by a critical
CMC-to-CB mass ratio $r_c$. For $r<r_c$, i.e., for low CMC concentration, the
gel is electrically conductive and shows a glassy-like viscoelastic spectrum,
pointing to a microstructure composed of a percolated network of CB
nanoparticles decorated by CMC. In contrast, gels with CMC concentration larger
than $r_c$ are non-conductive, indicating that the CB nanoparticles are
dispersed in the cellulose gum matrix as isolated clusters, and act as physical
crosslinkers of the CMC network, hence providing mechanical rigidity to the
composite. Moreover, in the concentration range, $r>r_c$ CB-CMC gels display a
power-law viscoelastic spectrum that depends strongly on the CMC concentration.
These relaxation spectra can be rescaled onto a master curve that exhibits a
power-law scaling in the high-frequency limit, with an exponent that follows
Zimm theory, showing that CMC plays a key role in the gel viscoelastic

to liquid crystal (LC) molecules in displays, ordering and dynamics in active
nematics are sensitive to boundary conditions; however, unlike passive liquid
crystals, active nematics, such as those composed of living matter, have the
potential to regulate their boundaries through self-generated stresses. Here,
using bacterial biofilms confined by a hydrogel as a model system, we show how
a three-dimensional, living nematic can actively shape itself and its boundary
in order to regulate its internal architecture through growth-induced stresses.
We show that biofilms exhibit a sharp transition in shape from domes to lenses
upon changing environmental stiffness or cell-substrate friction, which is
explained by a theoretical model considering the competition between
confinement and interfacial forces. The growth mode defines the progression of
the boundary, which in turn determines the trajectories and spatial
distribution of cell lineages. We further demonstrate that the evolving
boundary defines the orientational ordering of cells and the emergence of
topological defects in the interior of the biofilm. Our findings reveal novel
self-organization phenomena in confined active matter and provide strategies
for guiding the development of programmed microbial consortia with emergent
material properties.

28th of September 2021 (UT). We focus on the polarisation properties of 536
bright bursts with $\mathrm{S/N}>50$. We found that the Faraday rotation
measures (RMs) monotonically dropped from $-579 \ {\rm rad \ m^{-2}}$ to $-605
\ {\rm rad \ m^{-2}}$ in the 4-day window. The RM values were compatible with
the values ($-300$ to $-900\ {\rm rad \ m^{-2}}$ ) reported 4 month ago (Xu et
al. 2022). However, the RM evolution rate in the current observation window was
at least an order of magnitude smaller than the one ($\sim 500\ {\rm rad \
m^{-2}\, day^{-1}}$) previously reported during the rapid RM-variation phase,
but is still higher than the one ($\le 1\ {\rm rad \ m^{-2} day^{-1}}$ ) during
the later RM no-evolution phase. The bursts of FRB 20201124A were highly
polarised with the total degree of polarisation (circular plus linear) greater
than 90% for more than 90\% of all bursts. The distribution of linear
polarisation position angles (PAs), degree of linear polarisation ($L/I$), and
degree of circular polarisation ($V/I$) can be characterised with unimodal
distribution functions. During the observation window, the distributions became
wider with time, i.e. with larger scatter, but the centroids of the
distribution functions remained nearly constant. For individual bursts,
significant PA variations (confidence level 5-$\sigma$) were observed in 33% of
all bursts. The polarisation of single pulses seems to follow certain complex
trajectories on the Poincar\'e sphere, which may shed light on the radiation
mechanism at the source or the plasma properties along the path of FRB
propagation.

of the series, we present a systematic search of the spin period and linear
acceleration of the source object from both 996 individual pulse peaks and the
dedispersed time series. No credible spin period was found from this data set.
We rule out the presence of significant periodicity in the range between 1 ms
to 100 s with a pulse duty cycle $< 0.49\pm0.08$ (when the profile is defined
by a von-Mises function, not a boxcar function) and linear acceleration up to
$300$ m s$^{-2}$ in each of the four one-hour observing sessions, and up to
$0.6$ m s$^{-2}$ in all 4 days. These searches contest theoretical scenarios
involving a 1 ms to 100 s isolated magnetar/pulsar with surface magnetic field
$<10^{15}$ G and a small duty cycle (such as in a polar-cap emission mode) or a
pulsar with a companion star or black hole up to 100 M$_{\rm \odot}$ and
$P_b>10$ hours. We also perform a periodicity search of the fine structures and
identify 53 unrelated millisecond-timescale ""periods"" in multi-components with
the highest significance of 3.9 $\sigma$. The ""periods"" recovered from the fine

likely to come from a spin period. We caution against claiming spin periodicity

subsurface by exploiting information in the recorded seismic waveforms. This is
achieved by solving a highly nonnlinear and nonunique inverse problem. Bayesian
inference is therefore used to quantify uncertainties in the solution.
Variational inference is a method that provides probabilistic, Bayesian
solutions efficiently using optimization. The method has been applied to 2D FWI
problems to produce full Bayesian posterior distributions. However, due to
higher dimensionality and more expensive computational cost, the performance of
the method in 3D FWI problems remains unknown. We apply three variational
inference methods to 3D FWI and analyse their performance. Specifically we
apply automatic differential variational inference (ADVI), Stein variational
gradient descent (SVGD) and stochastic SVGD (sSVGD), to a 3D FWI problem, and
compare their results and computational cost. The results show that ADVI is the
most computationally efficient method but systematically underestimates the
uncertainty. The method can therefore be used to provide relatively rapid but
approximate insights into the subsurface together with a lower bound estimate
of the uncertainty. SVGD demands the highest computational cost, and still
produces biased results. In contrast, by including a randomized term in the
SVGD dynamics, sSVGD becomes a Markov chain Monte Carlo method and provides the
most accurate results at intermediate computational cost. We thus conclude that
3D variational full-waveform inversion is practically applicable, at least in
small problems, and can be used to image the Earth's interior and to provide
reasonable uncertainty estimates on those images.

at the boundary due to the asymmetry induced by the nearby boundary. High
surface pressure and shear stress from this collapse can damage, or clean, the
surface. A porous boundary, such as a filter, would act similarly to a
non-porous boundary but with reduced asymmetry and thus reduced effect. Prior
research has measured the cleaning effect of bubbles on filters using
ultrasonic cleaning, but it is not known how the bubble dynamics are
fundamentally affected by the porosity of the surface. We address this question
experimentally by investigating how the standoff distance, porosity, pore size,
and pore shape affect two collapse properties: bubble displacement and bubble
rebound size. We show that these properties depend primarily on the standoff
distance and porosity of the boundary and extend a previously developed
numerical model that approximates this behaviour. Using the numerical model in
combination with experimental data, we show that bubble displacement and bubble
rebound size each collapse onto respective single curves.

the three-dimensional structure of 16 Galactic molecular cloud complexes at
$\sim1$pc resolution using our novel three-dimensional dust mapping algorithm
\texttt{Dustribution}. Using \texttt{astrodendro} we derive a catalogue of
physical parameters for each complex. We recover structures with aspect ratios
between 1 and 11, i.e.\ everything from near-spherical to very elongated
shapes. We find a large variation in cloud environments that is not apparent
when studying them in two-dimensions. For example, the nearby California and
Orion A clouds look similar on-sky, but we find California to be more
sheet-like, and massive, which could explain their different star-formation
rates. In Carina, our most distant complex, we observe evidence for dust
sputtering, which explains its measured low dust mass. By calculating the total
mass of these individual clouds, we demonstrate that it is necessary to define
cloud boundaries in three-dimensions in order to obtain an accurate mass;
simply integrating the extinction overestimates masses. We find that Larson's
relationship on mass vs radius holds true whether you assume a spherical shape
for the cloud or take their true extents.

for reasonably-sized maps is slow and power hungry, which has been a bottleneck
towards fast and efficient robotic exploration. In this paper, we introduce a
new hardware accelerator architecture for MI computation that features a
low-latency, energy-efficient MI compute core and an optimized memory subsystem
that provides sufficient bandwidth to keep the cores fully utilized. The core
employs interleaving to counter the recursive algorithm, and workload balancing
and numerical approximations to reduce latency and energy consumption. We
demonstrate this optimized architecture with a Field-Programmable Gate Array

rendering MI computation for the whole map real time and at a fraction of the

casual outliers might be included in the behavior sequences as user behaviors
are likely to be diverse. Secondly, the span of time intervals between user
behaviors is random and irregular, for which a RNN-based module employed from
NLP is not perfectly adaptive. To handle these two issues, we propose the
Knowledge aware Adaptive Session multi-Topic network(KAST). It can adaptively

introduced so that the structural information from the user-item interaction

transforming a human image from the reference pose to a target pose while
preserving its style. Most existing methods encode the texture of the whole
reference human image into a latent space, and then utilize a decoder to
synthesize the image texture of the target pose. However, it is difficult to
recover the detailed texture of the whole human image. To alleviate this
problem, we propose a method by decoupling the human body into several parts
(\eg, hair, face, hands, feet, \etc) and then using each of these parts to
guide the synthesis of a realistic image of the person, which preserves the
detailed information of the generated images. In addition, we design a
multi-head attention-based module for PGHIS. Because most convolutional neural
network-based methods have difficulty in modeling long-range dependency due to
the convolutional operation, the long-range modeling capability of attention
mechanism is more suitable than convolutional neural networks for pose transfer
task, especially for sharp pose deformation. Extensive experiments on
Market-1501 and DeepFashion datasets reveal that our method almost outperforms
other existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both qualitative and
quantitative metrics.

GraspCaps: a novel architecture based on Capsule Networks for generating
per-point grasp configurations for familiar objects. In our work, the
activation vector of each capsule in the deepest capsule layer corresponds to
one specific class of object. This way, the network is able to extract a rich
feature vector of the objects present in the point cloud input, which is then
used for generating per-point grasp vectors. This approach should allow the
network to learn specific grasping strategies for each of the different object
categories. Along with GraspCaps we present a method for generating a large

used to train the GraspCaps network. We performed an extensive set of
experiments to assess the performance of the proposed approach regarding
familiar object recognition accuracy and grasp success rate on challenging real

by the sum of the square of the Weyl scalar, of the strength of the field
associated to the Weyl vector, and a conformally invariant geometry-matter
coupling term, constructed from the matter Lagrangian and the Weyl scalar.
After substituting the Weyl scalar in terms of its Riemannian counterpart, the
quadratic action is defined in Riemann geometry, and involves a nonminimal
coupling between the Ricci scalar and the matter Lagrangian. For the sake of
generality, a more general Lagrangian, in which the Weyl vector is nonminmally
coupled with an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar, is also considered. By
varying the action independently with respect to the metric and the connection,
the independent connection can be expressed as the Levi-Civita connection of an
auxiliary, Ricci scalar and Weyl vector dependent metric, which is related to
the physical metric by means of a conformal transformation. The field equations
are obtained in both the metric and the Palatini formulations. The cosmological
implications of the Palatini field equations are investigated for three
distinct models corresponding to different forms of the coupling functions. A
comparison with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is also performed, and we find
that the Palatini type cosmological models can give an acceptable description

The event rate initially increased exponentially but the source activity
stopped within 24 hours after the 4th day. The detection of 542 bursts in one
hour during the fourth day marked the highest event rate detected from one
single FRB source so far. The bursts have complex structures in the
time-frequency space. We find a double-peak distribution of the waiting time,
which can be modeled with two log-normal functions peaking at 51.22 ms and
10.05 s, respectively. Compared with the emission from a previous active
episode of the source detected with FAST, the second distribution peak time is
smaller, suggesting that this peak is defined by the activity level of the

bandwidth and a full bandwidth and find that the energy distribution is not

require thousands of images in order to perform accurate detection, and there
exist few images of hazardous conditions as they are generally rare. In this
paper, we examine the detection of snow-covered sidewalks along bus routes.
Previous work has focused on detecting other vehicles in heavy snowfall or
simply detecting the presence of snow. However, our application has an added
complication of determining if the snow covers areas of importance and can
cause falls or other accidents (e.g. snow covering a sidewalk) or simply covers
some background area (e.g. snow on a neighboring field). This problem involves
localizing the positions of the areas of importance when they are not
necessarily visible.
  We introduce a method that utilizes Structure from Motion (SfM) rather than
additional annotated data to address this issue. Specifically, our method
learns the locations of sidewalks in a given scene by applying a segmentation
model and SfM to images from bus cameras during clear weather. Then, we use the
learned locations to detect if and where the sidewalks become obscured with
snow. After evaluating across various threshold parameters, we identify an
optimal range at which our method consistently classifies different categories
of sidewalk images correctly. Although we demonstrate an application for snow
coverage along bus routes, this method can extend to other hazardous conditions

across many domains, a major concern is their inherent opaqueness and the
safety of such systems in real-world use cases. To overcome these issues, we
need agents that can quantify their uncertainty and detect out-of-distribution
(OOD) states. Existing uncertainty estimation techniques, like Monte-Carlo
Dropout or Deep Ensembles, have not seen widespread adoption in on-policy deep
RL. We posit that this is due to two reasons: concepts like uncertainty and OOD
states are not well defined compared to supervised learning, especially for
on-policy RL methods. Secondly, available implementations and comparative
studies for uncertainty estimation methods in RL have been limited. To overcome
the first gap, we propose definitions of uncertainty and OOD for Actor-Critic
RL algorithms, namely, proximal policy optimization (PPO), and present possible
applicable measures. In particular, we discuss the concepts of value and policy
uncertainty. The second point is addressed by implementing different
uncertainty estimation methods and comparing them across a number of
environments. The OOD detection performance is evaluated via a custom
evaluation benchmark of in-distribution (ID) and OOD states for various RL
environments. We identify a trade-off between reward and OOD detection
performance. To overcome this, we formulate a Pareto optimization problem in
which we simultaneously optimize for reward and OOD detection performance. We
show experimentally that the recently proposed method of Masksembles strikes a
favourable balance among the survey methods, enabling high-quality uncertainty
estimation and OOD detection while matching the performance of original RL
agents.

depths, widths, patch sizes, and kernel sizes, indicating a degree of
model-independence to the covariance structure. Motivated by these findings, we
then propose a learning-free multivariate initialization scheme for
convolutional filters using a simple, closed-form construction of their
covariance. Models using our initialization outperform those using traditional
univariate initializations, and typically meet or exceed the performance of
those initialized from the covariances of learned filters; in some cases, this
improvement can be achieved without training the depthwise convolutional

of random packings of granular chains under large amplitude oscillatory shear.
We find that the maximum stress and the penetration depth of the shear
deformation into the material bulk are nonmonotonic functions of friction with
extrema at intermediate values of $\mu$. We also show that the regularly
repeated gaps between the adjacent grains, which are special to commercial
granular chains, broaden the shear zone and enhance the entanglements in the
system by promoting the interlocking events between chains. These topological
constraints can significantly increase the degree of strain stiffening. Our
findings highlight the differences between the physics of granular chain

the difference in the measurements of hyperon yields in the two experiments -

that a fireball can have two quantum states - with and without ignited
Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). With an increase of the collision energy of heavy
ions, the probability of QGP ignition increases. At the same time, the
probability of the formation of fireball without QGP ignition also remains
nonzero even at nuclear collision energies that are much higher than the
threshold QGP formation energy, which may be erroneously considered to be fixed
and which is intensively sought in modern heavy ion accelerators. Thus, at SPS
energy of heavy ion collisions \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 17.3 GeV, which is much higher
than the assumed threshold energy of QGP formation in the region around or
slightly above of \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3 GeV, only half of the central collisions of
heavy ions bring to the formation of a fireball consisted of deconfined matter,
the remaining half of the collisions lead to the formation of a fireball from

for delta maintenance with zero hardware cost, and integrates an inline area

Moreover, a complimentary delta maintenance strategy is incorporated, which
selectively maintains delta chunks in the main data area to break through the

diverse sources hinges critically on being exposed to properly correlated
signals during the early phases of training. Interfering with the learning
process during this initial stage can permanently impair the development of a
skill, both in artificial and biological systems where the phenomenon is known
as critical learning period. We show that critical periods arise from the
complex and unstable early transient dynamics, which are decisive of final
performance of the trained system and their learned representations. This
evidence challenges the view, engendered by analysis of wide and shallow
networks, that early learning dynamics of neural networks are simple, akin to
those of a linear model. Indeed, we show that even deep linear networks exhibit
critical learning periods for multi-source integration, while shallow networks
do not. To better understand how the internal representations change according
to disturbances or sensory deficits, we introduce a new measure of source
sensitivity, which allows us to track the inhibition and integration of sources
during training. Our analysis of inhibition suggests cross-source
reconstruction as a natural auxiliary training objective, and indeed we show
that architectures trained with cross-sensor reconstruction objectives are
remarkably more resilient to critical periods. Our findings suggest that the
recent success in self-supervised multi-modal training compared to previous

expensive, hurting their adoption in broader applications.
  This work tackles the saving of transaction fees for economic blockchain
applications. The key insight is that other than the existing ""default"" mode to
execute application logic fully on-chain, i.e., in smart contracts, and in fine
granularity, i.e., user request per transaction, there are alternative
execution modes with advantages in cost-effectiveness.
  On Ethereum, we propose a holistic middleware platform supporting flexible
and secure transaction executions, including off-chain states and batching of
user requests. Furthermore, we propose control-plane schemes to adapt the
execution mode to the current workload for optimal runtime cost.
  We present a case study on the institutional accounts (e.g., coinbase.com)
intensively sending Ether on Ethereum blockchains. By collecting real-life
transactions, we construct workload benchmarks and show that our work saves 18%

the nearest ($127.7 \pm 0.3$ pc) neutron star candidate in the single-lined
spectroscopic binary LAMOST J235456.76+335625.7 (hereafter J2354). Utilizing
the multi-epoch spectra and high-cadence periodic light curves, we measure the
mass of the visible star ($M_{\rm vis}=0.70\pm 0.05\ M_{\odot}$) and determine
the mass function of the invisible object $f(M)=0.525 \pm 0.004\ M_{\odot}$,
i.e., the mass of the unseen compact object is $M_{\rm inv} \geq 1.26 \pm 0.03\
M_{\odot}$. The excess UV emission due to a hot supramassive white dwarf is
absent. Hence, it is likely that J2354 harbors a neutron star. J2354 is X-ray
dim (the $0.1$--$2.4$ keV luminosity $<10^{30}\ {\rm erg\ s^{-1}}$) since it is
not detected in the ROSAT all-sky surveys in X-ray. One-hour exceptionally
sensitive radio follow-up observations with FAST, the largest single-dish radio
telescope, failed to reveal any radio pulsating signals (the potential pulse
power at $1.4$ GHz is $<6.8\times 10^{23}\ {\rm erg\ s^{-1}}$). Hence, the
neutron star candidate in J2354 can only be discovered via our time-resolved
observations. The alternative scenario involving a nearby supramassive cold
white dwarf cannot be fully excluded. Our discovery demonstrates a promising
way to unveil the missing population of backyard inactive neutron stars or
supramassive cold white dwarfs in binaries by exploring the optical time
domain, thereby facilitating understanding of the supernovae explosion and

well-trained agent can be regarded as a software system. However, less

attacks. Given normal observations, an agent implanted with backdoors takes
actions leading to high rewards. However, the same agent takes actions that
lead to low rewards if the observations are injected with triggers that can
activate the backdoor. In this paper, we propose Baffle (Backdoor Attack for
Offline Reinforcement Learning) and evaluate how different Offline RL
algorithms react to this attack. Our experiments conducted on four tasks and
four offline RL algorithms expose a disquieting fact: none of the existing
offline RL algorithms is immune to such a backdoor attack. More specifically,
Baffle modifies $10\%$ of the datasets for four tasks (3 robotic controls and 1
autonomous driving). Agents trained on the poisoned datasets perform well in
normal settings. However, when triggers are presented, the agents' performance
decreases drastically by $63.6\%$, $57.8\%$, $60.8\%$ and $44.7\%$ in the four
tasks on average. The backdoor still persists after fine-tuning poisoned agents
on clean datasets. We further show that the inserted backdoor is also hard to
be detected by a popular defensive method. This paper calls attention to
developing more effective protection for the open-source offline RL dataset.

examining behavioral data raises significant privacy concerns, and second,
approaches must scale to support a large number of users. Existing approaches
do not address these challenges sufficiently. We propose mPSAuth, an approach
for continuously tracking various data sources reflecting user behavior (e.g.,
touchscreen interactions, sensor data) and estimating the likelihood of the
current user being legitimate based on machine learning techniques. With
mPSAuth, both the authentication protocol and the machine learning models
operate on homomorphically encrypted data to ensure the users' privacy.
Furthermore, the number of machine learning models used by mPSAuth is
independent of the number of users, thus providing adequate scalability. In an
extensive evaluation based on real-world data from a mobile application, we
illustrate that mPSAuth can provide high accuracy with low encryption and

Understanding the relative timescales of flow and reaction kinetics plays an
important role, not only in the choice of models required for the accurate
simulation of these devices but also their design/optimization studies. There
are several definitions of chemical timescales, which can largely be classified
as algebraic or eigenvalue-based methods. The computational complexity (and
hence cost) depends on the method of evaluation of the chemical timescales and
size of the chemical reaction mechanism. The computational cost and robustness
of the methodology of evaluating the reaction times scales is an important
consideration in large-scale multi-dimensional simulations using detailed
chemical mechanisms. In this work, we present a computational efficient and
robust methodology to evaluate chemical timescales based on the algebraic
method. Comparison of this novel methodology with other traditional methods is
presented for a range of fuel-air mixtures, pressures and temperatures

Here, we report the results from a suite of 3D cosmological

comparable to the expected lifetime of supermassive stars (SMSs). Our findings
suggest that magnetic fields are rapidly amplified by strong accretion shocks
irrespective of the initial magnetic field strength and reach the saturation
state. They stabilize the accretion disks and significantly reduce
fragmentation by enhancing the Jeans mass in comparison with pure
hydrodynamical runs. Although the initial clump masses are larger in MHD runs,
the rapid coalescence of clumps in non-MHD cases due to the higher degree of
fragmentation results in similar masses. Overall, the central clumps have
masses of $\rm 10^5~M_{\odot}$ and the mean mass accretion rates of $\rm \sim
0.1 ~M_{\odot}/yr$ are similar in both MHD and non-MHD cases. The multiplicity
of SMSs is significantly reduced in MHD simulations. Such strongly amplified

of diffusion-based modelling, but also hinder the adaption of diffusion models
in real-life applications. Not to mention, the efficiency of computational
models is fast becoming a significant concern due to excessive energy
consumption and environmental scares. These factors have led to multiple
contributions in the literature that focus on devising computationally
efficient DMs. In this review, we present the most recent advances in diffusion
models for vision, specifically focusing on the important design aspects that
affect the computational efficiency of DMs. In particular, we emphasize the
recently proposed design choices that have led to more efficient DMs. Unlike
the other recent reviews, which discuss diffusion models from a broad
perspective, this survey is aimed at pushing this research direction forward by
highlighting the design strategies in the literature that are resulting in
practicable models for the broader research community. We also provide a future
outlook of diffusion models in vision from their computational efficiency
viewpoint.

  Text-Matching Recommendation Systems",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Given a user's input text, text-matching recommender systems output relevant
items by comparing the input text to available items' description, such as
product-to-product recommendation on e-commerce platforms. As users' interests
and item inventory are expected to change, it is important for a text-matching
system to generalize to data shifts, a task known as out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. However, we find that the popular approach of fine-tuning a
large, base language model on paired item relevance data (e.g., user clicks)
can be counter-productive for OOD generalization. For a product recommendation
task, fine-tuning obtains worse accuracy than the base model when recommending
items in a new category or for a future time period. To explain this
generalization failure, we consider an intervention-based importance metric,
which shows that a fine-tuned model captures spurious correlations and fails to
learn the causal features that determine the relevance between any two text
inputs. Moreover, standard methods for causal regularization do not apply in
this setting, because unlike in images, there exist no universally spurious
features in a text-matching task (the same token may be spurious or causal
depending on the text it is being matched to). For OOD generalization on text
inputs, therefore, we highlight a different goal: avoiding high importance
scores for certain features. We do so using an intervention-based regularizer
that constraints the causal effect of any token on the model's relevance score
to be similar to the base model. Results on Amazon product and 3 question
recommendation datasets show that our proposed regularizer improves
generalization for both in-distribution and OOD evaluation, especially in
difficult scenarios when the base model is not accurate.

in artificial life. The cellular automata, which can handle these in a
composite way, is highly restricted in its form and behavior because it
represents life as a pattern of cells. In contrast, the virtual creatures
proposed by Karl Sims have a very high degree of freedom in terms of morphology
and behavior. However, they have limited expressive capacity in terms of those
viewpoints. This study carefully extracts the characteristics of the cellular
automata and Sims models to propose a new artificial life model that can
simulate reproduction, development, and individual interactions while
exhibiting high expressive power for morphology and behavior. The simulation
was performed by sequentially reading a book with genetic information and
repeatedly executing four actions: expansion, connection, disconnection, and
transition. The virtual creatures in the proposed model exhibit unique survival
strategies and lifestyles and acquire interesting properties in reproduction,
development, and individual interactions while having freedom in morphology and
behavior.

  Framework of Nonlocal Models with Uncertainty Quantification",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  We consider the problem of modeling heterogeneous materials where micro-scale
dynamics and interactions affect global behavior. In the presence of
heterogeneities in material microstructure it is often impractical, if not
impossible, to provide quantitative characterization of material response. The
goal of this work is to develop a Bayesian framework for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) in material response prediction when using nonlocal models.
Our approach combines the nonlocal operator regression (NOR) technique and
Bayesian inference. Specifically, we use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
method to sample the posterior probability distribution on parameters involved
in the nonlocal constitutive law, and associated modeling discrepancies
relative to higher fidelity computations. As an application, we consider the
propagation of stress waves through a one-dimensional heterogeneous bar with
randomly generated microstructure. Several numerical tests illustrate the
construction, enabling UQ in nonlocal model predictions. Although nonlocal
models have become popular means for homogenization, their statistical
calibration with respect to high-fidelity models has not been presented before.
This work is a first step towards statistical characterization of nonlocal
model discrepancy in the context of homogenization.

technologies capable of reducing the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. While
this technology has the potential to scale, its success hinges on our ability
to mitigate its risks. An important aspect of risk mitigation concerns
assurances that the injected CO2 remains within the storage complex. Amongst
the different monitoring modalities, seismic imaging stands out with its
ability to attain high resolution and high fidelity images. However, these
superior features come, unfortunately, at prohibitive costs and time-intensive
efforts potentially rendering extensive seismic monitoring undesirable. To
overcome this shortcoming, we present a methodology where time-lapse images are
created by inverting non-replicated time-lapse monitoring data jointly. By no
longer insisting on replication of the surveys to obtain high fidelity
time-lapse images and differences, extreme costs and time-consuming labor are
averted. To demonstrate our approach, hundreds of noisy time-lapse seismic
datasets are simulated that contain imprints of regular CO2 plumes and
irregular plumes that leak. These time-lapse datasets are subsequently inverted
to produce time-lapse difference images used to train a deep neural classifier.
The testing results show that the classifier is capable of detecting CO2
leakage automatically on unseen data and with a reasonable accuracy.

origin-destination matrix (ODM) inference using data from IoT (Internet of

information from multiple data sources, while controlling for differences in
data quality across sources. We assess the effectiveness of the framework
through a real-world experiment in Greater Adelaide (GA), Australia. We infer
car OD flows within the region using four separate data sources: site-level
traffic counts from loop detectors, vehicle trajectories recorded by roadside
Bluetooth sensors, partial OD flows based on data from in-vehicle navigation
systems, and journey-to-work data collected by the Australian Census. We
compare our OD inferences with those from the current version of the
Metropolitan Adelaide Strategic Transport Model (MASTEM), calibrated using data
from traditional household travel surveys. We find remarkable consistency
between our inferences and those from MASTEM, despite differences in input data
and methodologies. For example, for the morning peak period, we predict the
total number of trips made within GA to be equal to 556,000, while the
corresponding prediction from MASTEM is equal to 484,000. The two predictions
are within 20 per cent of each other. When we compare the spatial distribution
of trips, in terms of origins and destinations, we find that our inferred OD
matrix has an 86 per cent cosine similarity to the corresponding MASTEM matrix.
In summary, our results show that the proposed framework can produce highly
comparable ODM, trip production and trip attraction patterns to those inferred
from traditional household travel survey-based transportation demand modelling
methods.
