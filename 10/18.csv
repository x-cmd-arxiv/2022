  2022",,,,"cs.RO cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Humans intuitively solve tasks in versatile ways, varying their behavior in
terms of trajectory-based planning and for individual steps. Thus, they can
easily generalize and adapt to new and changing environments. Current Imitation
Learning algorithms often only consider unimodal expert demonstrations and act
in a state-action-based setting, making it difficult for them to imitate human
behavior in case of versatile demonstrations. Instead, we combine a mixture of
movement primitives with a distribution matching objective to learn versatile
behaviors that match the expert's behavior and versatility. To facilitate
generalization to novel task configurations, we do not directly match the
agent's and expert's trajectory distributions but rather work with concise
geometric descriptors which generalize well to unseen task configurations. We
empirically validate our method on various robot tasks using versatile human
demonstrations and compare to imitation learning algorithms in a state-action
setting as well as a trajectory-based setting. We find that the geometric
descriptors greatly help in generalizing to new task configurations and that
combining them with our distribution-matching objective is crucial for
representing and reproducing versatile behavior.

of intense recent focus in the Reinforcement Learning (RL) literature, to
develop new sample complexity results and performance guarantees for
data-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC) for constrained linear systems. In
its simplest form, imitation learning is an approach that tries to learn an
expert policy by querying samples from an expert. Recent approaches to
data-driven MPC have used the simplest form of imitation learning known as
behavior cloning to learn controllers that mimic the performance of MPC by
online sampling of the trajectories of the closed-loop MPC system. Behavior
cloning, however, is a method that is known to be data inefficient and suffer
from distribution shifts. As an alternative, we develop a variant of the
forward training algorithm which is an on-policy imitation learning method
proposed by Ross et al. (2010). Our algorithm uses the structure of constrained
linear MPC, and our analysis uses the properties of the explicit MPC solution
to theoretically bound the number of online MPC trajectories needed to achieve
optimal performance. We validate our results through simulations and show that
the forward training algorithm is indeed superior to behavior cloning when
applied to MPC.

unlabelled data for machine learning (ML), however the underlying principles
are often method-specific. An SSL framework derived from biological first
principles of embodied learning could unify the various SSL methods, help
elucidate learning in the brain, and possibly improve ML. SSL commonly
transforms each training datapoint into a pair of views, uses the knowledge of
this pairing as a positive (i.e. non-contrastive) self-supervisory sign, and
potentially opposes it to unrelated, (i.e. contrastive) negative examples.
Here, we show that this type of self-supervision is an incomplete
implementation of a concept from neuroscience, the Efference Copy (EC).
Specifically, the brain also transforms the environment through efference, i.e.
motor commands, however it sends to itself an EC of the full commands, i.e.
more than a mere SSL sign. In addition, its action representations are likely
egocentric. From such a principled foundation we formally recover and extend
SSL methods such as SimCLR, BYOL, and ReLIC under a common theoretical
framework, i.e. Self-supervision Through Efference Copies (S-TEC). Empirically,
S-TEC restructures meaningfully the within- and between-class representations.
This manifests as improvement in recent strong SSL baselines in image
classification, segmentation, object detection, and in audio. These results
hypothesize a testable positive influence from the brain's motor outputs onto
its sensory representations.

driving and damping properties to those for the observed acoustic modes, we
also provide a short overview of our current knowledge for these modes in the
Sun and solar-type stars (which show solar-like oscillations) before diving
into the specific problem of solar gravity modes. Finally, taking recent
estimates into account, we conclude and confirm that the low-frequency domain
(typically between $10\,\mu$Hz and $100\,\mu$Hz) is certainly more suited to
focus on for detecting solar gravity modes. More precisely, around $60\,\mu$Hz,
the theoretical estimates are slightly lower than the observational detection
threshold as provided by the GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies)
instrument by about a factor of two only. This is typically within the current
uncertainties associated with theoretical estimates and should motivate us for
improving our knowledge on turbulence in the whole solar convective region,

data trading and cross-domain data analytics. However, as the multiple parties
are involved in a BDS platform, the issue of security and privacy violation
arises. There have been a number of solutions for enhancing security and
preserving privacy at different big data operations (e.g., data operation, data
searching, data sharing and data outsourcing). To the best of our knowledge,
there is no existing survey that has particularly focused on the broad and
systematic developments of these security and privacy solutions. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art solutions introduced
to tackle security and privacy issues in BDS. For a better understanding, we
first introduce a general model for BDS and identify the security and privacy
requirements. We discuss and classify the state-of-the-art security and privacy
solutions for BDS according to the identified requirements. Finally, based on
the insights gained, we present and discuss new promising research directions.

adopted the moment of order two, from the proposed theorem, and transformed it,
which allowed us to exemplify this class as unit distribution. We named it as
Alpha-Unit (AU) distribution, which contains a single positive parameter
$\alpha$ ($\text{AU}(\alpha) \in [0,1]$). We presented its properties and
showed two estimation methods for the $\alpha$ parameter, the maximum
likelihood estimator (MLE) and uniformly minimum-variance unbiased estimator

robustness was demonstrated. As real-world application, we adopted two sets of
unit data, the first regarding the dynamics of Chilean inflation in the

competitive, whenever the data present a range greater than 0.4 and extremely
heavy asymmetric tail. We compared our model against other commonly used unit

being faint coronal X-ray jets. The evidence for this is that the events result
from eruption of minifilaments of projected sizes spanning 5000 -- 14,000 km
and with erupting velocities spanning 19 -- 46 km/s, which are in the range of
values observed in cases of confirmed X-ray polar coronal hole jets. In SXR
images, and in some EUV images, all five events show base brightenings, and
faint indications of a jet spire that (in four of five cases where
determinable) moves away from the brightest base brightening; these properties
are common to more obvious X-ray jets. For a comparatively low-latitude event,
the minifilament erupts from near (<~few arcsec) a location of
near-eruption-time opposite-polarity magnetic-flux-patch convergence, which
again is consistent with many observed coronal jets. Thus, although too faint
to be identified as jets a priori, otherwise all five events are identical to
typical coronal jets. This suggests that jets may be more numerous than
recognized in previous studies, and might contribute substantially to solar
wind outflow, and to the population of magnetic switchbacks observed in Parker

supervised learning, despite requiring no training labels. We explore how
contrastive learning can be applied to hundreds of thousands of unlabeled Mars
terrain images, collected from the Mars rovers Curiosity and Perseverance, and
from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Such methods are appealing since the vast
majority of Mars images are unlabeled as manual annotation is labor intensive
and requires extensive domain knowledge. Contrastive learning, however, assumes
that any given pair of distinct images contain distinct semantic content. This
is an issue for Mars image datasets, as any two pairs of Mars images are far
more likely to be semantically similar due to the lack of visual diversity on
the planet's surface. Making the assumption that pairs of images will be in
visual contrast - when they are in fact not - results in pairs that are falsely
considered as negatives, impacting training performance. In this study, we
propose two approaches to resolve this: 1) an unsupervised deep clustering step
on the Mars datasets, which identifies clusters of images containing similar
semantic content and corrects false negative errors during training, and 2) a
simple approach which mixes data from different domains to increase visual
diversity of the total training dataset. Both cases reduce the rate of false
negative pairs, thus minimizing the rate in which the model is incorrectly
penalized during contrastive training. These modified approaches remain fully
unsupervised end-to-end. To evaluate their performance, we add a single linear
layer trained to generate class predictions based on these
contrastively-learned features and demonstrate increased performance compared

inter-class discriminability and inter-domain stability of the features

mathematical logic, and almost all of these concepts can be regarded as
developing from the Stone representation theorem. In the Stone representation
theorem, a Boolean algebra is represented as the algebra of the clopen sets of
a Stone space. And based on this, a natural connection is established between
the structure of Stone space and the semantics of propositional logic. In other
words, models of a propositional theory are represented as points in a Stone
space. This enables us to use the concepts of topology to describe many facts
in logic. In this paper, we do the same thing for the first-order logic. That
is, we organize the basic objects of semantics of first-order logic, such as
theories, models, elementary embeddings, and so on, into a kind of topological
structure defined abstractly. To be precise, this kind of structure is a kind
of enriched-topological space which we call cylindric space in this paper.
Furthermore, based on this topological representation of semantics of
first-order logic, we systematically introduce a method of point-set topology
into the research of model theory. We demonstrate the great advantages of this
topological method with an example and provide a general discussion of its
features, advantages, and connection to the type space.

three-dimensional convection-resolving model with passive tracers to mimic
SO$_2$ and H$_2$O for two latitudinal cases. The tracers are relaxed towards a
vertical profile in agreement with measured values, with a timescale varying
over several orders of magnitude. The vertical mixing is quantified, it is
strong for a relaxation timescale high in front of the convective timescale,
around 4 hours. The spatial and temporal variability of the tracer due to the
convective activity is estimated, with horizontal structures of several
kilometres. At the Equator, the model is resolving a convective layer at the
cloud top (70 km) suggested by some observations, the impact of such turbulent
activity on chemical species is accounted for the first time. From the resolved
convective plumes, a vertical eddy diffusion is estimated, consistent with past
estimations from in-situ measurements, but several orders of magnitude higher
than values used in 1D chemistry modelling. The results are compared to
observations, with some spatial and temporal variability correlation,

between learning policies and datasets. To address this problem, existing works
mainly focus on designing sophisticated algorithms to explicitly or implicitly
constrain the learned policy to be close to the behavior policy. The constraint
applies not only to well-performing actions but also to inferior ones, which
limits the performance upper bound of the learned policy. Instead of aligning
the densities of two distributions, aligning the supports gives a relaxed
constraint while still being able to avoid out-of-distribution actions.
Therefore, we propose a simple yet effective method to boost offline RL
algorithms based on the observation that resampling a dataset keeps the
distribution support unchanged. More specifically, we construct a better
behavior policy by resampling each transition in an old dataset according to
its episodic return. We dub our method ReD (Return-based Data Rebalance), which
can be implemented with less than 10 lines of code change and adds negligible
running time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReD is effective at
boosting offline RL performance and orthogonal to decoupling strategies in
long-tailed classification. New state-of-the-arts are achieved on the D4RL

variable. Due to the intense magnetic fields they possess, they develop dark
spots on their surface that, because of rotation, introduce a periodic
variation of brightness.In addition, the presence of surrounding disks could
generate flux variations by variable extinction or accretion. Both can lead to
a brightness decrease or increase, respectively. Here, we have compiled a
catalog of light curves for 379 T Tauri stars in the Lagoon Nebula (M8) region,
using VVVX survey data in the Ks-band. All these stars were already classified
as pre-MS stars based on other indicators. The data presented here are spread
over a period of about eight years, which gives us a unique follow-up time for
these sources at this wavelength. The light curves were classified according to
their degree of periodicity and asymmetry, to constrain the physical processes
responsible for their variation. Periods were compared with the ones found in
literature, on a much shorter baseline. This allowed us to prove that for 126
stars, the magnetically active regions remain stable for several years.
Besides, our near-IR data were compared with the optical Kepler/K2 light
curves, when available, giving us a better understanding of the mechanisms

receiver systems or solar towers have the highest commercial potential in
large-scale power plants because of reaching the highest temperature. With the
increasing solar chemistry applications and new solar thermal power plants,
various receiver designs require in micro or macro-scale, in materials, and
temperature limits. The purpose of the article is computing the geometry of the
receiver in various conditions and provide information during the conceptual
design. This paper proposes a surrogate-based design optimization for a
micro-scale volumetric receiver model in the literature. The study includes
creating training data using the Latin Hypercube method, training five
different surrogate models, surrogate model validation, selection procedure,
and surrogate-based design optimization. Selected surrogates have over $98\%$
R\textsuperscript{2} fit and less than $4\%$ root mean square error. In final
step, optimization performance compared with the base model. Because of the
model complexity, surrogate models reached better objective values in a
significantly shorter time.

accompanied by very high-energy gamma rays up to 18 TeV observed by LHAASO and
a photon-like air shower of 251 TeV detected by Carpet-2. These energetic gamma

photons but do not attenuate on the background radiation. Here we explore the

studied using numerical relativity simulations. These start only a short finite
time before merger, at which point appropriate initial conditions must be
imposed. A key task is therefore to identify the configuration that is
appropriate for the binary and its environment at this stage of the evolution.
In this work we study the behaviour of wave dark matter around equal mass black
hole binaries, finding that there is a preferred, quasi-stationary profile that
persists and grows over multiple orbits, in contrast to heavier mass dark
matter where any overdensity tends to be dispersed by the binary motion. Whilst
different initial configurations converge to the preferred quasi-stationary one
after several orbits, unwanted transient oscillations are generated in the
process, which may impact on the signal in short simulation runs. We also point
out that naively superimposing the matter onto a circular binary results in
artificially eccentric orbits due to the matter backreaction, which is an
effect of the initial conditions and not a signature of dark matter. We discuss
the further work required so that comparison of waveforms obtained with
environments to vacuum cases can be done in a meaningful way.

  Learning","Published in TMLR, October 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Improved state space models, such as Recurrent State Space Models (RSSMs),
are a key factor behind recent advances in model-based reinforcement learning
(RL). Yet, despite their empirical success, many of the underlying design
choices are not well understood. We show that RSSMs use a suboptimal inference
scheme and that models trained using this inference overestimate the aleatoric
uncertainty of the ground truth system. We find this overestimation implicitly
regularizes RSSMs and allows them to succeed in model-based RL. We postulate
that this implicit regularization fulfills the same functionality as explicitly
modeling epistemic uncertainty, which is crucial for many other model-based RL
approaches. Yet, overestimating aleatoric uncertainty can also impair
performance in cases where accurately estimating it matters, e.g., when we have
to deal with occlusions, missing observations, or fusing sensor modalities at
different frequencies. Moreover, the implicit regularization is a side-effect
of the inference scheme and not the result of a rigorous, principled
formulation, which renders analyzing or improving RSSMs difficult. Thus, we
propose an alternative approach building on well-understood components for
modeling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, dubbed Variational Recurrent
Kalman Network (VRKN). This approach uses Kalman updates for exact smoothing
inference in a latent space and Monte Carlo Dropout to model epistemic
uncertainty. Due to the Kalman updates, the VRKN can naturally handle missing
observations or sensor fusion problems with varying numbers of observations per
time step. Our experiments show that using the VRKN instead of the RSSM
improves performance in tasks where appropriately capturing aleatoric
uncertainty is crucial while matching it in the deterministic standard
benchmarks.

the best model in the BIG-Bench paper outperforming average reported
human-rater results on 65% of the BIG-Bench tasks via few-shot prompting. But
on what tasks do language models fall short of average human-rater performance,
and are those tasks actually unsolvable by current language models?
  In this work, we focus on a suite of 23 challenging BIG-Bench tasks which we
call BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). These are the task for which prior language model
evaluations did not outperform the average human-rater. We find that applying
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to BBH tasks enables PaLM to surpass the

(code-davinci-002) to surpass the average human-rater performance on 17 of the

prompting without CoT, as done in the BIG-Bench evaluations (Srivastava et al.,

language models, which is better captured via CoT prompting. As further
analysis, we explore the interaction between CoT and model scale on BBH,

Machine learning models perform inherent feature selection and thus reveal key
factors that determine network robustness and vulnerability. As a case study,
we train and test such models on simulated data from several synthetic test

desynchronisation events after line failures with an average precision greater
than $0.996$ when averaging over all data sets. Learning transfer between

individual information. Despite the extra interpretability and tighter bounds
under composition GDP provides, many widely used mechanisms (e.g., the Laplace
mechanism) inherently provide GDP guarantees but often fail to take advantage
of this new framework because their privacy guarantees were derived under a
different background. In this paper, we study the asymptotic properties of
privacy profiles and develop a simple criterion to identify algorithms with GDP
properties. We propose an efficient method for GDP algorithms to narrow down
possible values of an optimal privacy measurement, $\mu$ with an arbitrarily
small and quantifiable margin of error. For non GDP algorithms, we provide a
post-processing procedure that can amplify existing privacy guarantees to meet
the GDP condition. As applications, we compare two single-parameter families of
privacy notions, $\epsilon$-DP, and $\mu$-GDP, and show that all $\epsilon$-DP
algorithms are intrinsically also GDP. Lastly, we show that the combination of
our measurement process and the composition theorem of GDP is a powerful and
convenient tool to handle compositions compared to the traditional standard and
advanced composition theorems.

However, most methods are currently either limited to specific editing types

demonstrate, for the very first time, the ability to apply complex (e.g.,

can change the posture and composition of one or multiple objects inside an

within its single high-resolution natural image provided by the user. Contrary
to previous work, our proposed method requires only a single input image and a
target text (the desired edit). It operates on real images, and does not
require any additional inputs (such as image masks or additional views of the
object). Our method, which we call ""Imagic"", leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model for this task. It produces a text embedding that
aligns with both the input image and the target text, while fine-tuning the
diffusion model to capture the image-specific appearance. We demonstrate the
quality and versatility of our method on numerous inputs from various domains,

chemicals that inhibit each other's effects have antagonistic interactions.
Current approaches for assessing the health effects of chemical mixtures do not
explicitly consider synergy or antagonism in the modeling, instead focusing on
either parametric or unconstrained nonparametric dose response surface
modeling. The parametric case can be too inflexible, while nonparametric
methods face a curse of dimensionality that leads to overly wiggly and
uninterpretable surface estimates. We propose a Bayesian approach that
decomposes the response surface into additive main effects and pairwise
interaction effects, and then detects synergistic and antagonistic
interactions. Variable selection decisions for each interaction component are
also provided. This Synergistic Antagonistic Interaction Detection (SAID)
framework is evaluated relative to existing approaches using simulation

is a key ingredient of topological quantum computation. We suggest a simple and
systematic approach to construct effective unitary protocols for braiding,
manipulation and readout of non-Abelian anyons and preparation of their
entangled states. We generalize the surface code to a more generic graph with
vertices of degree 2, 3 and 4. Our approach is based on the mapping of the
stabilizer code defined on such a graph onto a model of Majorana fermions
charged with respect to two emergent gauge fields. One gauge field is akin to
the physical magnetic field. The other one is responsible for emergence of the
non-Abelian anyonic statistics and has a purely geometric origin. This field
arises from assigning certain rules of orientation on the graph known as the
Kasteleyn orientation in the statistical theory of dimer coverings. Each
3-degree vertex on the graph carries the flux of this ""Kasteleyn"" field and
hosts a non-Abelian anyon. In our approach all the experimentally relevant
operators are unambiguously fixed by locality, unitarity and gauge invariance.

forming planetary systems with a chain of mean-motion resonances (MMR).
Dynamical evolution over time could disrupt the delicate resonant
configuration. We present TOI-1136, a 700-Myr-old G star hosting at least 6
transiting planets between $\sim$2 and 5 $R_\oplus$. The orbital period ratios
deviate from exact commensurability by only $10^{-4}$, smaller than the
$\sim$\,$10^{-2}$ deviations seen in typical Kepler near-resonant systems. A
transit-timing analysis measured the masses of the planets (3-8$M_\oplus$) and
demonstrated that the planets in TOI-1136 are in true resonances with librating
resonant angles. Based on a Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement of planet d, the
star's rotation appears to be aligned with the planetary orbital planes. The
well-aligned planetary system and the lack of detected binary companion
together suggest that TOI-1136's resonant chain formed in an isolated,
quiescent disk with no stellar fly-by, disk warp, or significant axial
asymmetry. With period ratios near 3:2, 2:1, 3:2, 7:5, and 3:2, TOI-1136 is the
first known resonant chain involving a second-order MMR (7:5) between two
first-order MMR. The formation of the delicate 7:5 resonance places strong
constraints on the system's migration history. Short-scale (starting from
$\sim$0.1 AU) Type-I migration with an inner disk edge is most consistent with
the formation of TOI-1136. A low disk surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm
1AU}\lesssim10^3$g~cm$^{-2}$; lower than the minimum-mass solar nebula) and the
resultant slower migration rate likely facilitated the formation of the 7:5
second-order MMR. TOI-1136's deep resonance suggests that it has not undergone
much resonant repulsion during its 700-Myr lifetime. One can rule out rapid
tidal dissipation within a rocky planet b or obliquity tides within the largest
planets d and f.

themselves in `at-risk' situations, as captured by proximity to a lower moving
boundary, which we call the `advancing front' of the epidemic. Specifically,
local time is accumulated along this boundary and, while individuals are
initially reflected, infection may eventually occur with a likelihood depending
on the accumulated local time as well as the intrinsic infectiousness of the
disease and the current contagiousness within the population. Our main
technical contribution is to give a rigorous formulation of this model in the
form of a well-posed interacting particle system. Moreover, we exploit the
precise construction of the system to establish an important martingale

such an attractive interaction that reproduces the observed spectral features
and doping dependence seen in angle-resolved photoemission experiments:
diminished $3k_F$ spectral weight, prominent spectral intensity of a
holon-folding branch, and the correct holon band width. While extended {\it
e-ph} coupling does not qualitatively alter the ground state of the 1D system
compared to the Hubbard model, it quantitatively enhances the long-range
superconducting correlations and suppresses spin correlations. Such an extended

physics of the structurally similar two-dimensional high-temperature
superconducting layered cuprates, which may tip the balance between intertwined

and tactile sensing to address the problem of tracking extrinsic contact
between object and environment. Knowing where the external contact occurs is a
first step towards methods that can actively control it in facilitating
downstream manipulation tasks. Prior work for localizing environmental contacts
typically assume a contact type (e.g. point or line), does not capture
contact/no-contact transitions, and only works with basic geometric-shaped
objects. Neural Contact Fields are the first method that can track arbitrary
multi-modal extrinsic contacts without making any assumptions about the contact
type. Our key insight is to estimate the probability of contact for any 3D
point in the latent space of object shapes, given vision-based tactile inputs
that sense the local motion resulting from the external contact. In
experiments, we find that Neural Contact Fields are able to localize multiple
contact patches without making any assumptions about the geometry of the
contact, and capture contact/no-contact transitions for known categories of
objects with unseen shapes in unseen environment configurations. In addition to
Neural Contact Fields, we also release our YCB-Extrinsic-Contact dataset of

However, most
existing models only use local convolution, making the model unable to handle
long-range dependency efficiently. Attention overcomes this problem by
aggregating global information but also makes the computational complexity
quadratic to the sequence length. Recently, Gu et al. [2021] proposed a model
called S4 inspired by the state space model. S4 can be efficiently implemented
as a global convolutional model whose kernel size equals the input sequence
length. S4 can model much longer sequences than Transformers and achieve
significant gains over SoTA on several long-range tasks. Despite its empirical
success, S4 is involved. It requires sophisticated parameterization and
initialization schemes. As a result, S4 is less intuitive and hard to use. Here
we aim to demystify S4 and extract basic principles that contribute to the
success of S4 as a global convolutional model. We focus on the structure of the
convolution kernel and identify two critical but intuitive principles enjoyed
by S4 that are sufficient to make up an effective global convolutional model:
1) The parameterization of the convolutional kernel needs to be efficient in
the sense that the number of parameters should scale sub-linearly with sequence
length. 2) The kernel needs to satisfy a decaying structure that the weights
for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones.
Based on the two principles, we propose a simple yet effective convolutional
model called Structured Global Convolution (SGConv). SGConv exhibits strong
empirical performance over several tasks: 1) With faster speed, SGConv
surpasses S4 on Long Range Arena and Speech Command datasets. 2) When plugging
SGConv into standard language and vision models, it shows the potential to
improve both efficiency and performance.

is of measure zero and satisfies the winning property of Schmidt. Hence for
every norm $\nu$, $\mathbf{BA} \cap \mathbf{DI}_\nu$ is winning and thus has
full Hausdorff dimension. In the present article we prove the following
dichotomy phenomenon: either $\mathbf{BA} \subset \mathbf{DI}_\nu$ or else
$\mathbf{BA} \smallsetminus \mathbf{DI}_\nu$ has full Hausdorff dimension. We
give several examples for each of the two cases. The dichotomy is based on

$g_\mathbb{R} \Lambda$ is unbounded (and then any precompact

or not, in which case the set of lattices in $X$ whose

illustrates fundamental effects from the intrinsic mass of beauty and charm

-- i.e. ALPINE ($z\sim 5$) and REBELS ($z \sim 7$) -- only provide us with a
single Far-Infrared (FIR) continuum data point for their individual targets.
Therefore, high-$z$ galaxies FIR spectral energy densities (SEDs) remain mostly
unconstrained, hinging on an assumption for their dust temperature ($T_{\rm
d}$) in the SED fitting procedure. This introduces uncertainties in the
inferred dust masses ($M_{\rm d }$), infrared luminosities ($L_{\rm IR}$), and
obscured Star Formation Rate (SFR) fraction at $z > 4$. In this work we use a
method that allows us to constrain $T_{\rm d}$ with a single band measurement
by combining the $158\ \mathrm{\mu m}$ continuum information with the overlying
[CII] emission line. We analyse the $21$ [CII] and FIR continuum detected
$z\sim 5$ galaxies in ALPINE, finding a range of $T_{\rm d}=25-60\ \mathrm{K}$
and $M_{\rm d} = 0.6-25.1\ \times 10^{7}\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Given the
measured stellar masses of ALPINE galaxies, the inferred dust yields are around
$M_{\rm d}/M_{\star} = (0.2-8) \times 10^{-3}$, consistent with theoretical
dust-production constraints. We find that $8$ out of $21$ ALPINE galaxies have
$L_{\rm IR} \geq 10^{12}\ \mathrm{L_{\odot}}$, comparable to UltraLuminous IR
Galaxies (ULIRGs). Relying on ultraviolet-to-optical SED fitting, the SFR was
underestimated by up to $2$ orders of magnitude in $4$ of these $8$ ULIRGs-like

separated into the Fanaroff-Riley I (FR-I) and II (FR-II) classes. Hybrid
morphology radio sources (HyMoRS) contain morphologies consistent with each
type of jet on either side: a powerful, highly relativistic FR-II-like jet
terminating in a hotspot on one side and an FRI-like plume on the other. HyMoRS
present a unique opportunity to study the conditions which give rise to the
dichotomy. Using host galaxy properties, we conduct the first multiwavelength
investigation into whether orientation can explain HyMoRS morphology. Through
optical spectroscopy and mid-infrared photometry, we analyze the emission
characteristics, and evaluate the broad characteristics of five HyMoRS host
galaxies at intermediate redshifts (0.4 < z < 1.5). The HyMoRS host galaxies in
our sample have properties consistent with typical host galaxies of FR-II
sources, suggesting that the observed hybrid morphologies may be caused by a
dense, cluster-like environment bending FR-II jets combined with a favorable
orientation which can make one side appear similar to an FR-I jet. Our results
thus support the hypothesis that HyMoRS are mainly caused by environment and
orientation.

Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) encodes clues to where to find relics of
heavy new physics in data, but its unwieldy 2499-by-2499 size (at operator
dimension 6) makes it difficult to draw general conclusions. In this paper, we
study the flavour structure of the SMEFT one loop anomalous dimension matrix of
dimension 6 current-current operators, a 1460-by-1460 submatrix. We take an
on-shell approach, laying bare simple patterns by factorising the entries of
the matrix into their gauge, kinematic and flavour parts. We explore the
properties of different diagram topologies, and make explicit the connection
between the IR-finiteness of certain diagrams and their gauge and flavour
structure. Through a completely general flavour decomposition of the Wilson
coefficient matrices, we uncover new flavour selection rules, from which small
subsystems emerge which mix almost exclusively amongst themselves. We show
that, for example, if we neglect all Yukawa couplings except for that of the
top quark, the selection rules produce block diagonalisation within the
current-current operators in which the largest block is a 61-by-61 matrix. We
provide all the ingredients of the calculations in comprehensive appendices,
including SM and SMEFT helicity amplitudes, and explicit results for phase
space integrals and gauge contractions. This deconstruction of the matrix, and
its resulting block-diagonalisation, provides a first step to understanding the
IR-relevant directions in the SMEFT parameter space, hence closing in on
natural places for heavy new physics to make itself known.

synchrotron signal was not convincingly established until now. We stack
low-frequency radio data from the OVRO-LWA around the 44 most massive, high

clusters to their characteristic, $R_{500}$ radii. Both high (73 MHz) and
co-added low ($36\text{--}68\text{ MHz}$) frequency channels separately

a Hubble constant $H$. The inferred CRE spectral index is flat, $p \simeq 2.0

equipartition or using $\dot{m}\xi_e\sim0.6\%$ inferred from the Fermi signal

The associated N-al theories can then be read off from this duality sequence.
The quiver $\mathcal{T}$ generically has an emergent Coulomb branch global

supermassive black hole (BH) accretion: an early, highly intermittent phase
(during which BHs are under-massive relative to local scaling relations),
followed by a phase of accelerated growth. We investigate physical factors that
drive the transition in BH accretion in cosmological zoom-in simulations from
the FIRE project, ranging from dwarf galaxies to galaxies sufficiently massive
to host luminous quasars. The simulations model multi-channel stellar feedback,
but neglect AGN feedback. We show that multiple physical properties, including
halo mass, galaxy stellar mass, and depth of the central gravitational
potential correlate with accelerated BH fueling: constant thresholds in these
properties are typically crossed within ~0.1 Hubble time of accelerated BH
fueling. Black hole masses increase sharply when the stellar surface density in
the inner 1 kpc crosses a threshold Sigma1 ~ 10^9.5 Msun/kpc^2, a
characteristic value above which gravity prevents stellar feedback from
ejecting gas, and similar to the value above which galaxies are observed to
quench. We further show that accelerated BH growth correlates with the
emergence of long-lived, thin gas disks, as well as with virialization of the
inner circumgalactic medium. The halo mass Mh ~ 10^12 Msun and stellar mass
Mstar ~ 10^10.5 Msun at which BH growth accelerates correspond to ~L* galaxies.
The fact that stellar feedback becomes inefficient at ejecting gas from the

feedback appears to be most important in galaxies above ~L*.

can be executed on state-of-the-art quantum computers is a crucial part of the
software stack for quantum computing. One step in compiling a quantum circuit
to some device is quantum circuit mapping, where the circuit is transformed
such that it complies with the architecture's limited qubit connectivity.
Because the search space in quantum circuit mapping grows exponentially in the
number of qubits, it is desirable to consider as few of the device's physical
qubits as possible in the process. Previous work conjectured that it suffices
to consider only subarchitectures of a quantum computer composed of as many
qubits as used in the circuit. In this work, we refute this conjecture and
establish criteria for judging whether considering larger parts of the
architecture might yield better solutions to the mapping problem. We show that
determining subarchitectures that are of minimal size, i.e., of which no
physical qubit can be removed without losing the optimal mapping solution for
some quantum circuit, is a very hard problem. Based on a relaxation of the
criteria for optimality, we introduce a relaxed consideration that still
maintains optimality for practically relevant quantum circuits. Eventually,
this results in two methods for computing near-optimal sets of
subarchitectures$\unicode{x2014}$providing the basis for efficient quantum
circuit mapping solutions. We demonstrate the benefits of this novel method for
state-of-the-art quantum computers by IBM, Google and Rigetti.

J1627 is a highly-magnetized object consistent with a magnetar (an ultra long
period magnetar - ULPM), and demonstrate it is unlikely to be either a
magnetically or a rotationally-powered white dwarf. By studying these sources
together with previously detected objects, we find there are at least a handful
of promising candidates for Galactic ULPMs. The detections of these objects
imply a substantial number, $N \gtrsim 13000$ and $N \gtrsim 500$ for PSR
J0901--4046 like and GLEAM-X J1627 like objects, respectively, within our
Galaxy. These source densities, as well as cooling age limits from
non-detection of thermal X-rays, Galactic offsets, timing stability and dipole
spindown limits, all imply the ULPM candidates are substantially older than
confirmed Galactic magnetars and that their formation channel is a common one.
Their existence implies widespread survival of magnetar-like fields for several
Myr, distinct from the inferred behaviour in confirmed Galactic magnetars.
ULPMs may also constitute a second class of FRB progenitors which could
naturally exhibit very long periodic activity windows. Finally, we show that
existing radio campaigns are biased against detecting objects like these and
discuss strategies for future radio and X-ray surveys to identify more such
objects. We estimate that ${\cal O}(100)$ more such objects should be detected

recognized as an important future probe of the early Universe. Existing
theoretical studies primarily focused on describing the evolution and creation
of average distortions, ignoring spatial perturbations in the plasma. One of
the main reasons for this choice is that a treatment of the spectro-spatial
evolution of the photon field deep into the primordial Universe requires
solving a radiative transfer problem for the distortion signals, which in full
detail is computationally challenging. Here we provide the first crucial step
towards tackling this problem by formulating a new spectral discretisation of
the underlying average thermalisation Green's function. Our approach allows us
to convert the high-dimensional partial differential equation system
(~1,000-10,000 equations) into and set of ordinary differential equations of
much lower dimension (~10 equations). We demonstrate the precision of the
approach and highlight how it may be further improved in the future. We also
clarify the link of the observable spectral distortion parameters (e.g., mu and
y) to the computational spectral basis that we use in our frequency
discretisation. This reveals how several basis-dependent ambiguities can be
interpreted in future CMB analysis. Even if not exact, the new Green's function
discretisation can be used to formulate a generalised photon
Boltzmann-hierarchy, which can then be solved with methods that are familiar
from theoretical studies of the CMB temperature and polarisation anisotropies.
We will carry this program out in a series of companion papers, thereby opening
the path to full spectro-spatial exploration of the CMB with future CMB imagers
and spectrometers.

sector of the model possesses a global SU(6) symmetry, which is spontaneously
broken and results in the Higgs doublets of the minimal SUSY Standard Model

Higgs doublets and solves the doublet-triplet splitting problem. Because of the
SU(6) symmetry, the couplings of the Higgs sector are tightly restricted, and
thus the model is more predictive than the minimal SUSY SU(5). We determine all
the grand-unified-theory parameters via the matching conditions of the gauge
coupling constants at the unification scale and calculate proton lifetime,
confronting this with current experimental bounds. We discuss that this model
is incompatible with the constrained MSSM, whilst it has a large viable
parameter space in the high-scale SUSY scenario. The perturbativity condition
on the trilinear coupling of the adjoint Higgs field imposes an upper (lower)
limit on the wino (gluino) mass, implying a hierarchical mass pattern for these

systematic block-by-block validation. The TorchDIVA model is shown to produce

soft background gauge symmetry, which lives on the light-like trajectories of
energetic particles and allows for a manifestly gauge-invariant representation
of the interactions in terms of a soft covariant derivative and the soft

from soft-collinear gravity at the Lagrangian level. The symmetries of the

programme. Previous optical spectra had never shown any signatures of
broad-line emission, and evidence of the AGN had come only from X-ray
observations, being the optical narrow-line flux ratios unable to unambiguously
denote this galaxy as a Seyfert. Our 2019 TNG data unexpectedly revealed the
appearance of broad-line components in both the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$
profiles, along with a rise of the continuum, thus implying a changing-look AGN
transitioning from a type 2 (no broad-line emission) towards a (nearly) type 1.
The broad-line emission has then been confirmed by our 2022 follow-up
observations, whereas the rising continuum has no longer been detected, which
hints at a further evolution backwards to a (nearly) type 2. The presence of
broad-line components also allowed us to obtain the first single-epoch estimate
of the black hole mass (log(MBH/Msun) $\sim$ 8.1) in this source. The observed
spectral variability might be the result of a change in the accretion activity
of NGC 4156, although variable absorption cannot be completely excluded.

agglomerate of granular material. Understanding the mechanical properties of
these objects is relevant for many scientific reasons: space missions design,
evaluation of impact threats to our planet, and understanding the nature of
asteroids and their implication in the origin of the solar system. In-situ
measurements of mechanical properties require complex and costly space
missions. Here a laboratory-scale characterization of wave propagation in
granular media is presented using a novel experimental setup as well as
numerical simulations. The pressure inside an asteroid is still a matter of
debate, but it definitely presents a pressure gradient towards the interior.
This is why impact characterization needs to be performed as a function of the
confining pressure. Our experimental setup allows for the simultaneous
measurement of the external confining pressure, internal pressure, total
strain, and acceleration in a 50 cm side squared box filled up with a billion
grains. We study the propagation of impact-generated and shaker-born seismic
body waves in the 500 Hz range. Through subsequent compression-relaxation
cycles, it was observed that the granular media behaves on average like a solid
with a constant elastic modulus during each compression. Effective medium
theory (EMT) for granular media explains the data at low pressure. After each
compression-relaxation cycle, the elastic modulus increases, and a high
hysteresis is observed: relaxation shows a more complex behavior than
compression. We show that seismic waves generated by both impact and vibration
travels at the pressure wave speed. Thanks to a numerical model, we measure a
strong wave attenuation $\alpha\sim3.4$ Np/m. We found that the wave speed
increases with the confining pressure with a $p^{1/2}$.

a transformation of this linear, output-inclusive Koopman model renders a new

systems that correspond to specific phenotypes, the performance measure. We

considered as ""cloth state funnel"" that manipulates arbitrarily configured
clothing items into a predefined deformable configuration (i.e.
canonicalization) at an appropriate rigid pose (i.e. alignment). In the end,
the cloth items will result in a compact set of structured and highly visible

effectively guides learning to avoid adverse local minima during learning.
Using this objective, we learn a multi-arm, multi-primitive policy that
strategically chooses between dynamic flings and quasi-static pick and place
actions to achieve efficient canonicalized-alignment. We evaluate this approach
on a real-world ironing and folding system that relies on this learned policy

non-parametric regression algorithm. The posterior is a distribution over sums
of decision trees, and predictions are made by averaging approximate samples
from the posterior.
  The combination of strong predictive performance and the ability to provide
uncertainty measures has led BART to be commonly used in the social sciences,
biostatistics, and causal inference.
  BART uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to obtain approximate posterior
samples over a parameterized space of sums of trees, but it has often been
observed that the chains are slow to mix.
  In this paper, we provide the first lower bound on the mixing time for a
simplified version of BART in which we reduce the sum to a single tree and use
a subset of the possible moves for the MCMC proposal distribution. Our lower
bound for the mixing time grows exponentially with the number of data points.
  Inspired by this new connection between the mixing time and the number of
data points, we perform rigorous simulations on BART. We show qualitatively
that BART's mixing time increases with the number of data points.
  The slow mixing time of the simplified BART suggests a large variation
between different runs of the simplified BART algorithm and a similar large
variation is known for BART in the literature. This large variation could
result in a lack of stability in the models, predictions, and posterior
intervals obtained from the BART MCMC samples.
  Our lower bound and simulations suggest increasing the number of chains with
the number of data points.

after excising flares, these lines vary on the order of $1-20\%$ at
minute-cadence over the course of an hour. The absolute amplitude of
variability was greater for the faster rotating M~dwarfs in our sample. Among
the 5 stars for which measured the weaker Balmer lines, we note a tentative

around black holes that reside in active galactic nuclei. As supermassive black
holes impart energy on their host galaxy, so the galactic environment affects
the dynamics of solar-mass objects around black holes and the gravitational
waves emitted from non-vacuum asymmetric binaries. Only recently an exact
general-relativistic solution has been found that describes a Schwarzschild
black hole immersed in a dark matter halo of the Hernquist type. We perform an
extensive analysis of generic geodesics delving in such non-vacuum spacetimes
and compare our results with those obtained in Schwarzschild, as well as
calculate their gravitational-wave emission. Our findings indicate that the
radial and polar oscillation frequency ratios descend deeper into the strong
gravity region as the compactness of the halo increases. This translates to a
redshift of non-vacuum geodesics and their resulting waveforms with respect to
the vacuum ones. We calculate the overlap between waveforms resulting from
Schwarzschild and non-vacuum geometries and find that it decreases as the halo
compactness grows, meaning that dark matter environments should be
distinguishable by space-borne detectors. For compact environments, we find
that the apsidal precession is strongly affected due to the gravitational pull
of dark matter; the orbit's axis can rotate in the opposite direction as that
of the orbital motion, leading to a retrograde precession drift that depends on
the halo mass, as opposed to the typical prograde precession transpiring in
galactic-scale environments. Gravitational waves in retrograde-to-prograde
alterations demonstrate transient frequency phenomena around critical
non-precessing turning points, thus they may serve as `smoking guns' for the
presence of compact dark matter environments around supermassive black holes.

astrochemically relevant P-bearing species on water surface, we also validate
our method for 20 species with known binding energies. We used DFT calculations
(M06-2X/aug-cc-pVDZ) to calculate the energetics of molecules and
water-molecule clusters (1-3 H$_2$O molecules) and from this determined the
binding energy by comparing the complex and the separate molecule and cluster

calibrating our computational method using experimentally measured binding
energies. Using the 20 reference molecules we find that the 2H$_2$O cluster
size yields the best binding energy estimates and that the application of a
calibration to the data may improve the results for some classes of molecules,

small P-bearing molecules such as PH$_3$, PN, PO, HPO, PO$_2$ and POOH are
relatively volatile and should desorb prior or concomitantly with water ice,
while H$_2$PO, HPO$_2$, PO$_3$, PO$_2$OH can strongly bind to any hydroxylated

minimizes the Wasserstein distance between two maps, represented as point

proper alignment. We further benchmark AlignOT on various pairs of experimental

often suffer from a high missing rate, and the missingness may depend on many
patient factors. Under such a complex missing mechanism, statistical inference
of the parameters in prediction models for PRO measures is challenging,
especially when flexible imputation models such as machine learning or
nonparametric methods are used. Specifically, the slow convergence rate of the
flexible imputation model may lead to non-negligible bias, and the traditional
missing propensity, capable of removing such a bias, is hard to estimate due to
the complex missing mechanism. To efficiently infer the parameters of interest,
we propose to use an informative surrogate that can lead to a flexible
imputation model lying in a low-dimensional subspace. To remove the bias due to
the flexible imputation model, we identify a class of weighting functions as
alternatives to the traditional propensity score and estimate the
low-dimensional one within the identified function class. Based on the
estimated low-dimensional weighting function, we construct a one-step debiased
estimator without using any information of the true missing propensity. We
establish the asymptotic normality of the one-step debiased estimator.
Simulation and an application to real-world data demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed method.

downstream leading to a turbulent shock structure. Formally this is the Mach
number where plasma resistivity can no longer provide sufficient dissipation to
establish a stable shock, and is characterized by the downstream flow speed
becoming subsonic. We revisit these calculations, including in the MHD jump
conditions terms modeling the plasma energy loss to accelerated particles and
the presence of waves associated with these particles. The accelerated particle
contributions make an insignificant change, but the associated waves have a
more important effect. Upstream waves can be strongly amplified in intensity on
passing through the shock, and represent another means of shock dissipation.
The presence of such waves therefore increases the first critical fast Mach
number, especially at quasi-parallel shock where wave excitation is strongest.
These effects may have significance for the solar regions where shock waves
accelerate particles and cause Type II and Type III radio bursts, and also

study the implications of this cone structure for mirror symmetry, by
considering the instanton part of the prepotential in Calabi-Yau threefolds. We
show that such isomorphic flops across facets of the Kahler cone boundary give
rise to symmetry groups isomorphic to Coxeter groups. In the dual Mori cone,
non-flopping curve classes that are identified under these groups have the same
Gopakumar-Vafa invariants. This leads to instanton prepotentials invariant

The evaluation shows that our RAoPT model can reduce the Euclidean and

that optimize the CAMs in the standard model-free setting, with the additional
benefit of eliminating the need for reward engineering typically required to
balance collision avoidance and goal-reaching requirements. We evaluate the
proposed approach in multi-agent navigation environments. We show that the CAM

This paper attempts to determine whether galaxies in the local Universe possess
a significant reservoir of HI and what would be the accretion rates derived
from such reservoirs. We search the vicinity of 22 nearby galaxies for isolated
HI clouds or distinct streams in a systematic and automated manner. The HALOGAS
observations represent one of the most sensitive and detailed HI surveys to
date. These observations typically reach column density sensitivities of 10^19
cm^-2 over a 20 km/s width. We find 14 secure HI cloud candidates without an
observed optical counterpart. These cloud candidates appear to be analogues to
the most massive clouds detected around the Milky Way and M31. However, on
average their numbers seem significantly reduced. We constrain upper limits for
HI accretion in the local Universe. The average HI mass currently observed
amounts to a rate of 0.05 Msun/yr with a stringent upper limit of 0.22 Msun/yr,
confirming previous estimates. This is much lower than the average star
formation rate in this sample. Our best estimate, based on GBT detection limits
of several galaxies, suggests that another 0.04 Msun/yr could be accreted from
undetected clouds and streams. These results show that in nearby galaxies HI is
not being accreted at the same rate as stars are currently being formed. Our
study can not exclude that other forms of gas accretion are at work. However,
these observations also do not reveal extended neutral gas reservoirs around

neutron star as a function of its source-frame mass in an equation-of-state

source. If the cosmological parameters are assumed to be known, the redshift
can be converted to a luminosity distance, and the distance-inclination
degeneracy can thus be broken. We implement this new approach, studying a range
of binary neutron-star observing scenarios using Bayesian parameter estimation
on synthetic data. In the era of the third-generation detectors, for
observations with signal-to-noise ratios ranging from 6 to 167, we forecast up
to an $\sim70\%$ decrease in the $90\%$ credible interval of the distance and
inclination and up to an $\sim50\%$ decrease in that of the source-frame

($\sim50\%$) improvement in the measurements of distance and inclination for

used to better infer the source-frame masses and, hence, refine population

this work we characterise different outflow parameters throughout the
precessional cycle of the system. We analyse 10 NuSTAR ($3-70$ keV)
observations of $\sim$30~ks that span $\sim$1.5 precessional cycles. We extract
averaged spectra and model them using a combination of a double thermal jet
model (bjet) and pure neutral and relativistic reflection (xillverCp and
relxilllpCp) over an accretion disk. We find an average jet bulk velocity of
$\beta = v/c \sim0.29$ with an opening angle of $\lesssim$6~degrees. Eastern
jet kinetic power ranges from 1 to $10^{39}$~erg/s, with base ""coronal""
temperatures $T_o$ ranging between 14 and 18 keV. Nickel to iron abundances
remain constant at $\sim$9 (within 1$\sigma$). The western to eastern jet flux
ratio becomes $\sim1$ on intermediate phases, about 35% of the total
precessional orbit. The $3-70$ keV total unabsorbed luminosity of the jet and
disk ranges from 2 to 20 $\times$10$^{37}$~erg/s, with the disk reflection
component contributing mainly to the hard $20-30$ keV excess and the stationary
6.7 keV ionized Fe line complex. At low opening angles $\Theta$ we find that
the jet expands sideways following an adiabatic expansion of a gas with

(SE) supernovae (SNe), their massive ejecta should lead to broad, long-duration
lightcurves (LCs). Instead, literature samples of SE~SNe have reported
relatively narrow LCs with ejecta masses between 1-4 Msun that favor
progenitors <20-25 Msun. Working with the untargeted sample of (i)PTF SNe to
better constrain their rates, we search for SE~SNe with broad LCs. Using a
simple LC stretch compared to a template to measure broadness, we identified
eight significantly broader Type~Ibc SNe after applying quantitative sample
selection criteria. The LCs, colors, and spectra of these SNe are found to
evolve more slowly relative to typical Type~Ibc SNe, proportional with the
stretch. Bolometric LC modeling and their nebular spectra indicate high ejecta
and nickel masses, assuming radioactive decay powering. Additionally, these
objects are preferentially located in low-metallicity host galaxies with high
star-formation rates, which may account for their massive progenitors, as well
as their relative absence from the literature. Our study thus supports the link
between broad LCs (as measured by stretch) and high-mass progenitor stars in
SE~SNe with independent evidence from bolometric LC modeling, nebular spectra,
host environment properties, and photometric evolution.
  In the first systematic search of its kind using an untargeted sample, we use
the stretch distribution to identify a higher than previously appreciated
fraction of SE~SNe with broad LCs (~13%). Correcting for Malmquist and LC
duration observational biases, we conservatively estimate that a minimum of ~6%
of SE~SNe are consistent with high-mass progenitors. This result has
implications for the progenitor channels of SE~SNe, late stages of massive
stellar evolution, oxygen fraction in the universe, and formation channels for
stellar-mass black holes.(Abridged)

plenty of numerical and categorical features at the same time. However, how to
generate adversarial examples with mixed-type data is still seldom studied. In
this paper, we propose a novel attack algorithm M-Attack, which can effectively
generate adversarial examples in mixed-type data. Based on M-Attack, attackers
can attempt to mislead the targeted classification model's prediction, by only
slightly perturbing both the numerical and categorical features in the given
data samples. More importantly, by adding designed regularizations, our
generated adversarial examples can evade potential detection models, which
makes the attack indeed insidious. Through extensive empirical studies, we
validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our attack method and evaluate the

and local time variations of the mean horizontal circulation are evaluated. The
instantaneous horizontal winds exhibit a significant degree of spatiotemporal
variability often exceeding $\pm 150 $ m s$^{-1}$. The daily averaged zonal
mean winds demonstrate day-to-day variability. Eastward zonal winds and
northward (winter-to-summer) meridional winds are prevalent in the lower
thermosphere, which provides indirect observational evidence of the eastward
momentum deposition by small-scale gravity waves. The mean neutral winds and
circulation exhibit smaller scale structures in the lower thermosphere (90-120
km), while they are more homogeneous in the upper thermosphere, indicating the
increasingly dissipative nature of the thermosphere. The mean wind and
circulation patterns inferred from ICON/MIGHTI measurements can be used to
constrain and validate general circulation models, as well as input for
numerical wave models.

formulations of reinforcement learning that are simultaneously more efficient

the linear programming (LP) formulation of optimal control of Manne. A primal
version is called logistic Q-learning, and a dual variant is convex Q-learning.
This paper focuses on the latter, while building bridges with the former. The
main contributions follow: (i) The dual of convex Q-learning is not precisely
Manne's LP or a version of logistic Q-learning, but has similar structure that
reveals the need for regularization to avoid over-fitting. (ii) A sufficient
condition is obtained for a bounded solution to the Q-learning LP. (iii)
Simulation studies reveal numerical challenges when addressing sampled-data
systems based on a continuous time model. The challenge is addressed using
state-dependent sampling. The theory is illustrated with applications to
examples from OpenAI gym. It is shown that convex Q-learning is successful in
cases where standard Q-learning diverges, such as the LQR problem.

expanding world of remote work, providing new avenues for people to actively
participate in activities at a distance. However, humans operating MTRs often
have difficulty navigating in densely populated environments due to limited
situation awareness and narrow field-of-view, which reduces user acceptance and
satisfaction. Shared autonomy in navigation has been studied primarily in
static environments or in situations where only one pedestrian interacts with
the robot. We present a multimodal shared autonomy approach, leveraging visual
and haptic guidance, to provide navigation assistance for remote operators in
densely-populated environments. It uses a modified form of reciprocal velocity
obstacles for generating safe control inputs while taking social proxemics
constraints into account. Two different visual guidance designs, as well as
haptic force rendering, were proposed to convey safe control input. We
conducted a user study to compare the merits and limitations of multimodal
navigation assistance to haptic or visual assistance alone on a shared
navigation task. The study involved 15 participants operating a virtual
telepresence robot in a virtual hall with moving pedestrians, using the
different assistance modalities. We evaluated navigation performance,
transparency and cooperation, as well as user preferences. Our results showed
that participants preferred multimodal assistance with a visual guidance
trajectory over haptic or visual modalities alone, although it had no impact on
navigation performance. Additionally, we found that visual guidance
trajectories conveyed a higher degree of understanding and cooperation than
equivalent haptic cues in a navigation task.

coronagraphic imaging with large telescopes is limited by the smallest angular
offset from bright stars at which coronagraphs can observe. However, it is
possible to reach inside a telescopes coronagraphic regime by employing nulling
interferometry across a telescopes pupil. Indeed, cross-aperture nulling
interferometry can observe significantly closer to stars than typical
coronagraphs, enabling observations even within the stellar diffraction core.
Identifying an optimal nulling coronagraph, i.e., one with both a very small
IWA and a high throughput for exoplanet light, would thus be of great interest.
A systematic examination of available nulling options has therefore been
carried out, which has led to three things. The first is a topological overview
that unites both multi-aperture nulling interferometers and single-aperture
phase coronagraphs into a common geometrical framework. The second is a new
type of phase-mask coronagraph that has emerged from a gap in this framework,
called here the split-ring coronagraph. The third is a clear identification of
the optimal configuration for a nulling coronagraph, which turned out to be an
aperture-plane phase knife, i.e., an achromatic pi-radian phase shift applied
to half the telescope pupil prior to focusing the telescopes point spread

operations, sensors are placed to measure important quantities such as the
voltage magnitudes. In this paper, we consider a sensor placement problem which
seeks to identify locations for installing sensors that can capture all
possible violations of voltage magnitude limits. We formulate a bilevel
optimization problem that minimizes the number of sensors and avoids false
sensor alarms in the upper level while ensuring detection of any voltage
violations in the lower level. This problem is challenging due to the
nonlinearity of the power flow equations and the presence of binary variables.
Accordingly, we employ recently developed conservative linear approximations of
the power flow equations that overestimate or underestimate the voltage
magnitudes. By replacing the nonlinear power flow equations with conservative
linear approximations, we can ensure that the resulting sensor locations and
thresholds are sufficient to identify any constraint violations. Additionally,
we apply various problem reformulations to significantly improve computational
tractability while simultaneously ensuring an appropriate placement of sensors.
Lastly, we improve the quality of the results via an approximate gradient
descent method that adjusts the sensor thresholds. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method for several test cases, including a system

  Neutrino Observatory","148 pages. PhD Thesis",,,,"hep-ex hep-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Despite the rapid progression in our understanding of neutrinos over the last
half century, much is left unknown about their properties. This leaves
neutrinos as the most promising portal for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics,
and neutrinos have already provided fruitful surprises.
  A number of neutrino experiments in the last three decades have observed
anomalous oscillation signals consistent with a mass-squared splitting of
$\Delta m^2 \sim 1\ \textrm{eV}^2$, motivating the existence and search for
sterile neutrinos. On the other hand, other experiments have failed to see such
a signal.
  In this thesis, we present two analyses. The first is an update to the
sterile neutrino global fits with the inclusion of recent experimental data. We
find that the 3+1 model provides a better fit to the global data set compared
to the null, with an improvement of $\Delta \chi^2 = 51$ with the addition of
only 3 degrees of freedom, corresponding to $6.6\sigma$. While a substantial
improvement, we also find a irreconcilable tension between the data sets of
$5.1\sigma$, calculated using the parameter goodness-of-fit test. This
motivates the exploration of expanded models: a 3+2 model, and a 3+1+Decay
model. In the 3+2 model, we find negligible improvement to the fit, and an even
worse tension of $5.5\sigma$. In the more exotic 3+1+Decay model, we find the
tension reduced to $3.6\sigma$. While a substantial improvement compared to the
3+1 model with the introduction of only one additional parameter, the tension
is still too large to assuage concerns.
  The second analysis is the results of an expanded IceCube sterile neutrino
search. A previous sterile neutrino search found no evidence for sterile
neutrinos, finding a p-value of 8%. Of the three sterile mixing angles,
$\theta_{14}, \theta_{24}$, and $\theta_{34}$, only $\theta_{24}$ was fitted
for, as $\theta_{14}$ was negligible and $\theta_{34} = 0$ was considered a
conservative assumption. We present results of an analysis where we include
$\theta_{34}$ to the fitted model. Both a frequentist and Bayesian analysis
were conducted, with fits done in terms of the mass-squared splitting $\Delta
m_{41}^2$ and the mixing matrix parameters $|U_{\mu4}|^2$ and $|U_{\tau4}|^2$.
The frequentist analysis finds a best fit at $\Delta m_{41}^2 = 5.0\
\textrm{eV}^2$, $|U_{\mu4}|^2 = 0.04$, and $|U_{\tau4}|^2 = 0.006$, with a
p-value of 5.2% assuming Wilks' Theorem with 3 degrees of freedom.
Pseudoexperiments are indicating a smaller p-value 2.7%. The Bayesian analysis
finds a similar best fit point at $\Delta m_{41}^2 = 5.0\ \textrm{eV}^2$,
$|U_{\mu4}|^2 = 0.02$, and $|U_{\tau4}|^2 = 0.006$, with a Bayes factor
indicating a ``Very Strong'' preference for this sterile hypothesis over the
null hypothesis.

Electron-phonon coupling is treated by extending the theory of Allen [Phys.

spatio-temporal sparse observations of the velocity, using both a
physics-informed neural network (PINN) and adjoint-variational data
assimilation (4DVar). The performance of PINN is assessed against the benchmark
results from 4DVar. The PINN is efficient to implement, takes advantage of
automatic differentiation to evaluate the governing equations, and does not
require the development of an adjoint model. In addition, the flow evolution is
expressed in terms of the network parameters which have a far smaller dimension
than the predicted trajectory in state space or even just the initial condition
of the flow. Provided adequate observations, network architecture and training,
the PINN can yield satisfactory estimates of the the flow field, both for the
missing velocity data and the entirely unobserved pressure field. However,
accuracy depends on the network architecture, and the dependence is not known a
priori. In comparison to 4DVar estimation which becomes progressively more
accurate over the observation horizon, the PINN predictions are generally less
accurate and maintain the same level of errors throughout the assimilation time
window. Another notable distinction is the capacity to accurately forecast the
flow evolution: while the 4DVar prediction depart from the true flow state

relations (UR) involving neutron star bulk properties play a crucial role in
gravitational-wave astronomy. Considering a wide range of equations of state
originating from (i) phenomenological relativistic mean field models, (ii)
realistic EoS models based on different physical motivations, and (iii)
polytropic EoSs described by spectral decomposition method, we update the
EoS-insensitive relations involving NS tidal deformability (Multipole Love
relation) and the UR between f-mode frequency and tidal deformability (f-Love
relation). We analyze the binary neutron star (BNS) event GW170817 using the
frequency domain TaylorF2 waveform model with updated universal relations and
find that the additional contribution of the octupolar electric tidal parameter
and quadrupolar magnetic tidal parameter or the change of multipole Love
relation has no significant impact on the inferred NS properties. However,
adding the f-mode dynamical phase lowers the 90% upper bound on
$\tilde{\Lambda}$ by 16-20% as well as lowers the upper bound of NSs radii by
$\sim$500m. The combined URs (multipole Love and f-Love) developed in this work
predict a higher median (also a higher 90% upper bound) for $\tilde{\Lambda}$
by 6% and also predict higher radii for the binary components of GW170817 by
200-300m compared to the URs used previously in the literature. We further
perform injection and recovery studies on simulated events with different EoSs
in $\rm A+$ detector configuration as well as with third generation (3G)
Einstein telescope. In agreement with the literature, we find that neglecting
f-mode dynamical tides can significantly bias the inferred NS properties,
especially for low mass NSs. However, we also find that the impact of the URs
is within statistical errors.

a novel procedure that assumes the returns to schooling range from 5 to 15% (as
the literature has documented), and instrument for friendships using homophily

friendships. We find that having one more friend in adolescence increases
earnings between 7 and 14%, which is substantially larger than the OLS
estimates: measurement error and omitted variables lead to significant downward
bias. We also find suggestive evidence that although some friendships generate
larger returns in the labor market (close friendships, friendships with high
SES individuals), most friendships appear to have positive returns. Individuals
with more friendships in adolescence obtain more schooling and become more
social and connected adults, in turn making them more likely to work and to
work in higher paying occupations where social skills are rewarded.

distinctive phenomenological effects in the cosmological setting as compared to

of the bulk viscosity of the form $\xi\sim H^{1-2s} \rho_{m}^{s}$, that covers
intriguingly some well-known cases in the Eckart's theory. Some advantages of
this novel parametrization are: first, it allows to write the resulting
equations of cosmological evolution in the form of an autonomous system for any
value of $s$, so a general treatment of the fixed points and stability can be
done, and second, the bulk viscosity effect is consistently handled so that it
naturally turns off when matter density vanishes. As a main result we find,
based on detailed dynamical system analysis, one-parameter family of
de-Sitter-like asymptotic solutions with non-vanishing bulk viscosity
coefficient during different cosmological periods. Numerical computations are
performed jointly along with analytical phase space analysis in order to assess
more quantitatively the bulk viscosity effect on the cosmological background
evolution. Finally, as a first contact with observation we derive constraints
on the free parameters of some bulk viscosity models with specific
$s$-exponents from Supernovae Ia and observations of the Hubble parameter, by
performing a Bayesian statistical analysis thought the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
method.

our behaviour is strongly driven by our beliefs about the state of the world
around us. Accessing others' beliefs, intentions, or mental states in general,
could thus allow for more effective social interactions in natural contexts.
Yet these variables are not directly observable. Theory of Mind (TOM), the
ability to attribute to other agents' beliefs, intentions, or mental states in
general,
  is a crucial feature of human social interaction and has become of interest
to the robotics community. Recently, new models that are able to learn TOM have
been introduced. In this paper, we show the synergy between learning to predict
low-level mental states, such as intentions and goals, and attributing
high-level ones, such as beliefs. Assuming that learning of beliefs can take
place by observing own decision and beliefs estimation processes in partially
observable environments and using a simple feed-forward deep learning model, we
show that when learning to predict others' intentions and actions, faster and
more accurate predictions can be acquired if beliefs attribution is learnt
simultaneously with action and intentions prediction. We show that the learning
performance improves even when observing agents with a different decision
process and is higher when observing beliefs-driven chunks of behaviour. We
propose that our architectural approach can be relevant for the design of
future adaptive social robots that should be able to autonomously understand
and assist human partners in novel natural environments and tasks.

revisit transposed convolution and introduce a novel layer that allows us to
place information in the image selectively and choose the `stroke breadth' at
which the image is synthesized, whilst incurring a small additional parameter
cost. For this we introduce three ideas: firstly, we regress offsets to the
positions where the transpose convolution results are placed; secondly we
broadcast the offset weight locations over a learnable neighborhood; and
thirdly we use a compact parametrization to share weights and restrict offsets.
We show that simply substituting upsampling operators with our novel layer
produces substantial improvements across tasks as diverse as instance
segmentation, object detection, semantic segmentation, generative image
modeling, and 3D magnetic resonance image enhancement, while outperforming all
existing variants of transposed convolutions. Our novel layer can be used as a
drop-in replacement for 2D and 3D upsampling operators and the code will be
publicly available.

pure $O$-sequences, two classes of numerical sequences introduced by Stanley in
the late Seventies whose structural properties have since been the object of a
remarkable amount of interest in combinatorial commutative algebra. However, a
systematic study of the log-concavity of these sequences began only recently,
thanks to a paper by Iarrobino.
  The goal of this note is to address two general questions left open by
Iarrobino's work: 1) Given the integer pair $(r,t)$, are all level Hilbert
functions of codimension $r$ and type $t$ log-concave? 2) How about pure
$O$-sequences with the same parameters?
  Iarrobino's main results consisted of a positive answer to 1) for $r=2$ and
any $t$, and for $(r,t)=(3,1)$. Further, he proved that the answer to 1) is
negative for $(r,t)=(4,1)$.
  Our chief contribution to 1) is to provide a negative answer in all remaining
cases, with the exception of $(r,t)=(3,2)$, which is still open in any
characteristic. We then propose a few detailed conjectures specifically on
level Hilbert functions of codimension 3 and type 2.
  As for question 2), we show that the answer is positive for all pairs
$(r,1)$; negative for $(r,t)=(3,4)$; and negative for any pair $(r,t)$ with
$r\ge 4$ and $2\le t\le r+1$. Interestingly, the main case that remains open is
again $(r,t)=(3,2)$. Further, we conjecture that, in analogy with the behavior
of arbitrary level Hilbert functions, log-concavity fails for pure
$O$-sequences of any codimension $r\ge 3$ and type $t$ large enough.

other datasets. Devising a neural network manually from scratch based on
heuristics may not lead to an optimal model as there are numerous
hyperparameters in play. In this paper, we use two nature-inspired swarm
algorithms: particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO)
to obtain TDCN models to perform classification of fundus images into severity
classes. The power of swarm algorithms is used to search for various
combinations of convolutional, pooling, and normalization layers to provide the
best model for the task. It is observed that TDCN-PSO outperforms imagenet

Recent works have shown promising results using contrastive self-supervised

applications such as medical image classification, there is often class
imbalance, so randomly-selected instances mostly belong to the same majority
class, which precludes CSSL from learning inter-class differences. To address
this issue, we propose a novel framework, Iterative Self-paced Supervised
Contrastive Learning for MIL Representations (ItS2CLR), which improves the
learned representation by exploiting instance-level pseudo labels derived from
the bag-level labels. The framework employs a novel self-paced sampling
strategy to ensure the accuracy of pseudo labels. We evaluate ItS2CLR on three
medical datasets, showing that it improves the quality of instance-level pseudo
labels and representations, and outperforms existing MIL methods in terms of

provides location information to associate targets across frames beyond
appearance matching by comparing objects in two bounding boxes. Compared to the
typical transformer positional encoding, our proposed encoding is applied to
the 2D CNN features instead of the projected feature vectors to avoid losing
positional information. Moreover, the designed DST encoding can represent the
location of a single-frame object and the evolution of the location of the
trajectory among frames uniformly. Integrated with the DST encoding, we build a
transformer-based multi-object tracking model. The model takes a video clip as
input and conducts the target association in the clip. It can also perform
online inference by associating existing trajectories with objects from the
new-coming frames. Experiments on video multi-object tracking (MOT) and
multi-object tracking and segmentation (MOTS) datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed DST position encoding.

an untrainable convolution layer termed barrier layer that add the

related because the method by which CNNs generalize to minority classes, which
requires improvement, is wrapped in a blackbox. To demystify CNN decisions on
imbalanced data, we focus on their latent features. Although CNNs embed the
pattern knowledge learned from a training set in model parameters, the effect
of this knowledge is contained in feature and classification embeddings (FE and
CE). These embeddings can be extracted from a trained model and their global,
class properties (e.g., frequency, magnitude and identity) can be analyzed. We
find that important information regarding the ability of a neural network to
generalize to minority classes resides in the class top-K CE and FE. We show
that a CNN learns a limited number of class top-K CE per category, and that
their number and magnitudes vary based on whether the same class is balanced or
imbalanced. This calls into question whether a CNN has learned intrinsic class
features, or merely frequently occurring ones that happen to exist in the
sampled class distribution. We also hypothesize that latent class diversity is
as important as the number of class examples, which has important implications
for re-sampling and cost-sensitive methods. These methods generally focus on
rebalancing model weights, class numbers and margins; instead of diversifying
class latent features through augmentation. We also demonstrate that a CNN has
difficulty generalizing to test data if the magnitude of its top-K latent
features do not match the training set. We use three popular image datasets and
two cost-sensitive algorithms commonly employed in imbalanced learning for our
experiments.

especially with the advent of large language models. In and of itself, question
generation can be considered 'AI-hard', as there is a lack of unanimously
agreed sense of what makes a question 'good' or 'bad'. In this paper, we tackle
two fundamental problems in parallel: on one hand, we try to solve the scaling
problem, where question-generation and answering applications have to be
applied to a massive amount of text without ground truth labeling. The usual
approach to solve this problem is to either downsample or summarize. However,
there are critical risks of misinformation with these approaches. On the other
hand, and related to the misinformation problem, we try to solve the 'safety'
problem, as many public institutions rely on a much higher level of accuracy
for the content they provide. We introduce an adversarial approach to tackle
the question generation safety problem with scale. Specifically, we designed a
question-answering system that specifically prunes out unanswerable questions
that may be generated, and further increases the quality of the answers that
are generated. We build a production-ready, easily-plugged pipeline that can be
used on any given body of text, that is scalable and immune from generating any
hate speech, profanity, or misinformation. Based on the results, we are able to
generate more than six times the number of quality questions generated by the
abstractive approach, with a perceived quality being 44% higher, according to a
survey of 168 participants.

two perspectives for studying growth dynamics of reaction networks: one way is

characterized the biomass transfer process for autocatalytic, growing systems

have on the observed rates of FRBs and GRBs. For static lensing geometries, we
rule out the prospect that all FRBs are gravitationally lensed for a range of

Noisy Targets (CNT). This approach consists in conditioning the model on a
noisy version of the target(s) (e.g., actions in imitation learning or labels
in classification) at a random noise level (from small to large noise). At
inference time, since we do not know the target, we run the network with only
noise in place of the noisy target. CNT provides hints through the noisy label
(with less noise, we can more easily infer the true target). This give two main
benefits: 1) the top-down feedback allows the model to focus on simpler and
more digestible sub-problems and 2) rather than learning to solve the task from
scratch, the model will first learn to master easy examples (with less noise),
while slowly progressing toward harder examples (with more noise).

Our approach aims to explicitly regularize the distance between the positive

As an initial validation, we show that our method (called No Pairs Left Behind

objective formulations on standard benchmark datasets. To show the
effectiveness and potentials of NPLB on real-world complex data, we evaluate
our approach on a large-scale healthcare dataset (UK Biobank), demonstrating
that the embeddings learned by our model significantly outperform all other
current representations on tested downstream tasks. Additionally, we provide a
new model-agnostic single-time health risk definition that, when used in tandem
with the learned representations, achieves the most accurate prediction of

dataset that can be applied in different applications or analyses. K-means, the
most popular and simple clustering algorithm, might get trapped into local
minima if not properly initialized and the initialization of this algorithm is
done randomly. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve initial
cluster selection for K-means algorithm. This algorithm is based on the fact
that the initial centroids must be well separated from each other since the
final clusters are separated groups in feature space. The Convex Hull algorithm
facilitates the computing of the first two centroids and the remaining ones are
selected according to the distance from previously selected centers. To ensure
the selection of one center per cluster, we use the nearest neighbor technique.
To check the robustness of our proposed algorithm, we consider several
real-world datasets. We obtained only 7.33%, 7.90%, and 0% clustering error in
Iris, Letter, and Ruspini data respectively which proves better performance
than other existing systems. The results indicate that our proposed method
outperforms the conventional K means approach by accelerating the computation

applications. Conventional weed control methods mainly rely on chemical
herbicides or hand weeding, which are often cost-ineffective, environmentally
unfriendly, or even posing a threat to food safety and human health. Recently,
automated/robotic weeding using machine vision systems has seen increased
research attention with its potential for precise and individualized weed
treatment. However, dedicated, large-scale, and labeled weed image datasets are
required to develop robust and effective weed identification systems but they
are often difficult and expensive to obtain. To address this issue, data
augmentation approaches, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), have
been explored to generate highly realistic images for agricultural
applications. Yet, despite some progress, those approaches are often
complicated to train or have difficulties preserving fine details in images. In
this paper, we present the first work of applying diffusion probabilistic
models (also known as diffusion models) to generate high-quality synthetic weed
images based on transfer learning. Comprehensive experimental results show that
the developed approach consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art GAN
models, representing the best trade-off between sample fidelity and diversity
and highest FID score on a common weed dataset, CottonWeedID15. In addition,
the expanding dataset with synthetic weed images can apparently boost model
performance on four deep learning (DL) models for the weed classification
tasks. Furthermore, the DL models trained on CottonWeedID15 dataset with only
10% of real images and 90% of synthetic weed images achieve a testing accuracy
of over 94%, showing high-quality of the generated weed samples. The codes of

graph neural networks (GNNs) in recent years. Yet, MPNNs come with notable
limitations; namely, they are at most as powerful as the 1-dimensional
Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test in distinguishing graphs in a graph isomorphism
testing frame-work. To this end, researchers have drawn inspiration from the
k-WL hierarchy to develop more expressive GNNs. However, current
k-WL-equivalent GNNs are not practical for even small values of k, as k-WL
becomes combinatorially more complex as k grows. At the same time, several
works have found great empirical success in graph learning tasks without highly
expressive models, implying that chasing expressiveness with a coarse-grained
ruler of expressivity like k-WL is often unneeded in practical tasks. To truly
understand the expressiveness-complexity tradeoff, one desires a more
fine-grained ruler, which can more gradually increase expressiveness. Our work
puts forth such a proposal: Namely, we first propose the (k, c)(<=)-SETWL
hierarchy with greatly reduced complexity from k-WL, achieved by moving from
k-tuples of nodes to sets with <=k nodes defined over <=c connected components
in the induced original graph. We show favorable theoretical results for this
model in relation to k-WL, and concretize it via (k, c)(<=)-SETGNN, which is as
expressive as (k, c)(<=)-SETWL. Our model is practical and
progressively-expressive, increasing in power with k and c. We demonstrate
effectiveness on several benchmark datasets, achieving several state-of-the-art
results with runtime and memory usage applicable to practical graphs. We open
source our implementation at https://github.com/LingxiaoShawn/KCSetGNN.

height-dependent lateral deflection of wind velocity due to Coriolis
acceleration) on the evolution of wind turbine wakes. Specifically, this work
focuses on turbines that are yawed with respect to the mean incoming wind
velocity, which produces laterally deflected wakes that have a curled
(crescent-shaped) structure. These effects can be attributed to the
introduction of streamwise mean vorticity and the formation of a
Counter-rotating Vortex Pair (CVP) on the top and bottom of the wake. In a
Truly Neutral Boundary Layer (TNBL) in which wind veer effects are absent,
these effects can be captured well with existing analytical wake models
(Bastankhah et al. J. Fluid Mech. (2022), 933, A2). However, in the more
realistic case of atmospheric boundary layers subjected to Coriolis
acceleration, existing models need to be re-examined and generalized to include
the effects of wind veer. To this end, the flow in a Conventionally Neutral
Atmospheric Boundary Layer (CNBL) interacting with a yawed wind turbine is
investigated in this study. Results indicate that in the presence of veer the
CVP's top and bottom vortices exhibit considerable asymmetry. However, upon
removing the veer component of vorticity, the resulting distribution is much
more symmetric and agrees well with that observed in a TNBL. These results are
used to develop a simple correction to predict the mean velocity distribution
in the wake of a yawing turbine in a CNBL using analytical models. The
correction includes the veer-induced sideways wake deformation, as proposed by
Abkar et al. (Energies (2018), 11(7), 1838). The resulting model predictions
are compared to mean velocity distributions from the LES and good agreement is
obtained.

pulsators whose periods carry information about the internal structure of the

chemical mixing, two processes that are currently not well constrained in the
theory of stellar evolution. Aims. We aim to identify the pulsation modes and
deduce the internal rotation and buoyancy travel time for 106 $\gamma$ Dor
stars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission in
its southern continuous viewing zone (hereafter S-CVZ). We rely on 140
previously detected period-spacing patterns, that is, series of
(near-)consecutive pulsation mode periods. Methods. We used the asymptotic
expression to compute gravity-mode frequencies for ranges of the rotation rate
and buoyancy travel time that cover the physical range in $\gamma$~Dor stars.
Those frequencies were fitted to the observed period-spacing patterns by
minimising a custom cost function. The effects of rotation were evaluated using
the traditional approximation of rotation, using the stellar pulsation code
GYRE. Results. We obtained the pulsation mode identification, internal rotation
and buoyancy travel time for 60 TESS $\gamma$~Dor stars. For the remaining 46
targets, the detected patterns are either too short or contained too many
missing modes for unambiguous mode identification, and longer light curves are
required. For the successfully analysed stars, we found that period-spacing
patterns from 1-yr long TESS light curves can constrain the internal rotation
and buoyancy travel time to a precision of $\rm 0.03~d^{-1}$ and 400s,
respectively, which is about half as precise as literature results based on
4-yr Kepler light curves of $\gamma$~Dor stars.

Illustris-TNG and mini-Uchuu cosmological numerical simulations, we demonstrate
that this tail is caused by systematical uncertainties. We show that, by means
of a judicious cut, identified by the use of the Hinge function, it is possible
to determine a richness threshold above which the MRR is linear i.e., where
cluster mass scales with richness as logM_200 = alpha + beta logN_200. We
derive the MRR and show it is consistent with both sets of simulations with a
slope of beta ~ 1. We use our MRR to estimate cluster masses from the GalWCat19
catalog which we then use to set constraints on omega_m and sigma_8. Utilizing
the all-member MRR, we obtain constraints of omega_m = 0.31 (+0.04-0.03) and
sigma_8 = 0.82 (+0.05-0.04), and utilizing the red-member MRR, we obtain
omega_m = 0.31 (+0.04-0.03) and sigma_8 = 0.81 (+0.05-0.04). Our constraints on
omega_m and sigma_8 are consistent and very competitive with the Planck 2018
results.

brain-machine interface shared control system based on spiking neural networks

debatable. Here, we investigate the electronic anisotropy of CaFeAsF by
measuring its interlayer resistivity under magnetic fields with varying field
directions. Counterintuitively, the interlayer resistivity was larger in the
longitudinal configuration ($B \parallel I \parallel c$) than in the transverse
one ($B \perp I \parallel c$). The interlayer resistivity exhibited a so-called
coherence peak under in-plane fields and was highly anisotropic with respect to

Observationally mapping the variety of ejecta outcomes (ultra-relativistic,
mildly-relativistic or non-relativistic) in SNe of Type Ic with broad lines
(Ic-BL) can provide a key test to stellar explosion models. However, this
requires large samples of the rare Ic-BL events with follow-up observations in
the radio, where fast ejecta can be probed largely free of geometry and viewing
angle effects. Here, we present the results of a radio (and X-ray) follow-up
campaign of 16 SNe Ic-BL detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Our
radio campaign resulted in 4 counterpart detections and 12 deep upper limits.
None of the events in our sample is as relativistic as SN 1998bw and we
constrain the fraction of SN 1998bw-like explosions to $< 19\%$ (3$\sigma$
Gaussian equivalent), a factor of $\approx 2$ smaller than previously
established. We exclude relativistic ejecta with radio luminosity densities in
between $\approx 5\times10^{27}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ and $\approx 10^{29}$
erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ at $t\gtrsim 20$ d since explosion for $\approx 60\%$ of

achieved by leveraging the concept of state-triggered constraints (STCs) to
capture the hybrid dynamics induced by discrete contact modes without
explicitly reasoning about the combinatorics. STCs enable triggering arbitrary
constraints by a strict inequality condition in a continuous way. We first use
STCs to develop an automatic contact constraint activation method to minimize
the effective constraint space based on the utility of contact candidates for a
given task. Then, we introduce a re-formulation of the Coulomb friction model
based on STCs that is more efficient for the discovery of tangential forces
than the well-studied complementarity constraints-based approach. Last, we
include the proposed friction model in the planning and control of quasi-static
planar pushing. The performance of the STC-based contact activation and
friction methods is evaluated by extensive simulation experiments in a dynamic
pushing scenario. The results demonstrate that our methods outperform the
baselines based on complementarity constraints with a significant decrease in
the planning time and a higher success rate. We then compare the proposed
quasi-static pushing controller against a mixed-integer programming-based
approach in simulation and find that our method is computationally more
efficient and provides a better tracking accuracy, with the added benefit of
not requiring an initial control trajectory. Finally, we present hardware
experiments demonstrating the usability of our framework in executing complex

parameter estimation of stellar-mass compact binaries. Most of the compact
binaries are expected to have very small orbital eccentricities, but the small
eccentricities can have non-negligible effects on the parameter estimation due
to the high precision measurement in the detectors. Here we discuss the
accuracy requirements of GW waveform models for the parameter estimation of

quasi-circular GW waveform model is used, even very small eccentricity ($\sim
10^{-4}$) existing at GW frequency $0.1\, \text{Hz}$ induces systematic errors
that exceed statistical errors. We also show that eccentricity measurement in
the decihertz detectors is precise enough to detect the small eccentricity
($\sim 10^{-4}$). Ignoring the high-order Post-Newtonian (PN) corrections of
eccentricity effects does not make significant systematic errors. As a result,
including the 2 PN corrections of the effects will be enough for the accurate

existing methods have ignored this information in defending NLP models against
backdoor attacks. In this work, we take the first step to exploit the
pre-trained (unfine-tuned) weights to mitigate backdoors in fine-tuned language

mixes the backdoored weights (fine-tuned on poisoned data) with the pre-trained

an Embedding Purification (E-PUR) technique, which mitigates potential
backdoors existing in the word embeddings. We compare Fine-mixing with typical

magnetic order in BiFeO$_3$, but tuning its spin structure with continuously
varied uniaxial strain is still lacking up to date. Here, we apply \emph{in
situ} uniaxial strain to a freestanding BiFeO$_3$ film and use scanning NV
microscope to image the nanoscale magnetic order in real-space. The strain is
continuously increased from 0\% to 1.5\% and four images under different
strains are acquired during this period. The images show that the spin cycloid
tilts by $\sim 12.6^\circ$ when strain approaches 1.5\%. A first principle
calculation has been processed to show that the tilting is energetically
favorable under such strain. Our \emph{in situ} strain applying method in
combination with scanning NV microscope real-space imaging ability paves a new
way in studying the coupling between magnetic order and strain in BiFeO$_3$
films.

  Text-to-Image Generation",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, diffusion models have been proven to perform remarkably well in
text-to-image synthesis tasks in a number of studies, immediately presenting
new study opportunities for image generation. Google's Imagen follows this
research trend and outperforms DALLE2 as the best model for text-to-image
generation. However, Imagen merely uses a T5 language model for text
processing, which cannot ensure learning the semantic information of the text.
Furthermore, the Efficient UNet leveraged by Imagen is not the best choice in
image processing. To address these issues, we propose the Swinv2-Imagen, a
novel text-to-image diffusion model based on a Hierarchical Visual Transformer
and a Scene Graph incorporating a semantic layout. In the proposed model, the
feature vectors of entities and relationships are extracted and involved in the
diffusion model, effectively improving the quality of generated images. On top
of that, we also introduce a Swin-Transformer-based UNet architecture, called
Swinv2-Unet, which can address the problems stemming from the CNN convolution
operations. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of
the proposed model by using three real-world datasets, i.e., MSCOCO, CUB and
MM-CelebA-HQ. The experimental results show that the proposed Swinv2-Imagen

  Perspective","Findings of EMNLP2022",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  In recent years, vision and language pre-training (VLP) models have advanced
the state-of-the-art results in a variety of cross-modal downstream tasks.
Aligning cross-modal semantics is claimed to be one of the essential
capabilities of VLP models. However, it still remains unclear about the inner
working mechanism of alignment in VLP models. In this paper, we propose a new
probing method that is based on image captioning to first empirically study the
cross-modal semantics alignment of VLP models. Our probing method is built upon
the fact that given an image-caption pair, the VLP models will give a score,
indicating how well two modalities are aligned; maximizing such scores will
generate sentences that VLP models believe are of good alignment. Analyzing
these sentences thus will reveal in what way different modalities are aligned
and how well these alignments are in VLP models. We apply our probing method to
five popular VLP models, including UNITER, ROSITA, ViLBERT, CLIP, and LXMERT,
and provide a comprehensive analysis of the generated captions guided by these
models. Our results show that VLP models (1) focus more on just aligning
objects with visual words, while neglecting global semantics; (2) prefer fixed
sentence patterns, thus ignoring more important textual information including
fluency and grammar; and (3) deem the captions with more visual words are
better aligned with images. These findings indicate that VLP models still have
weaknesses in cross-modal semantics alignment and we hope this work will draw
researchers' attention to such problems when designing a new VLP model.

  Controllable Text Generation","Accepted at EMNLP2022",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Prompt learning with immensely large Casual Language Models (CLMs) has been
shown promising for attribute-controllable text generation (CTG). However,
vanilla prompt tuning tends to imitate training corpus characteristics beyond
the control attributes, resulting in a poor generalization ability. Moreover,
it is less able to capture the relationship between different attributes,
further limiting the control performance. In this paper, we propose a new CTG
approach, namely DisCup, which incorporates the attribute knowledge of
discriminator to optimize the control-prompts, steering a frozen CLM to produce
attribute-specific texts. Specifically, the frozen CLM model, capable of
producing multitudinous texts, is first used to generate the next-token
candidates based on the context, so as to ensure the diversity of tokens to be
predicted. Then, we leverage an attribute-discriminator to select
desired/undesired tokens from those candidates, providing the inter-attribute
knowledge. Finally, we bridge the above two traits by an unlikelihood objective
for prompt-tuning. Extensive experimental results show that DisCup can achieve
a new state-of-the-art control performance while maintaining an efficient and
high-quality text generation, only relying on around 10 virtual tokens.

speech into target language text without generating the intermediate
transcriptions. However, the training of end-to-end methods relies on parallel
ST data, which are difficult and expensive to obtain. Fortunately, the
supervised data for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation
(MT) are usually more accessible, making zero-shot speech translation a
potential direction. Existing zero-shot methods fail to align the two
modalities of speech and text into a shared semantic space, resulting in much
worse performance compared to the supervised ST methods. In order to enable
zero-shot ST, we propose a novel Discrete Cross-Modal Alignment (DCMA) method
that employs a shared discrete vocabulary space to accommodate and match both
modalities of speech and text. Specifically, we introduce a vector quantization
module to discretize the continuous representations of speech and text into a
finite set of virtual tokens, and use ASR data to map corresponding speech and
text to the same virtual token in a shared codebook. This way, source language
speech can be embedded in the same semantic space as the source language text,
which can be then transformed into target language text with an MT module.
Experiments on multiple language pairs demonstrate that our zero-shot ST method
significantly improves the SOTA, and even performers on par with the strong
supervised ST baselines.

net orbital angular momentum does not cancel, can lead to systems with a
rotating disc. This situation can occur with either wet (gas-rich) mergers
involving one or two spiral galaxies, e.g., NGC~5128, or dry (relatively

The spheroid and disc masses of the progenitor galaxies and merger remnant

robust discriminative residual feature maps to detect forgery faces (with
diverse or even unknown artifact types). Furthermore, the general federated

further boost the representation generalization. Experiments conducted on

tasks. While sensory representations have been extensively studied, the
representations of motor actions are still an area of active exploration. Our
work reveals that a space containing meaningful action representations emerges
when a multi-task policy network takes as inputs both states and task
embeddings. Moderate constraints are added to improve its representation
ability. Therefore, interpolated or composed embeddings can function as a
high-level interface within this space, providing instructions to the agent for
executing meaningful action sequences. Empirical results demonstrate that the
proposed action representations are effective for intra-action interpolation
and inter-action composition with limited or no additional learning.
Furthermore, our approach exhibits superior task adaptation ability compared to
strong baselines in Mujoco locomotion tasks. Our work sheds light on the

principal objects are target objects such as people and vehicles. Each target
in the video data has rich spatio-temporal context information. Most existing

context in anomaly detection. The spatial context information represents the
relationship between the detection target and surrounding targets. Anomaly
detection makes a lot of sense. To this end, a video anomaly detection
algorithm based on target spatio-temporal context fusion is proposed. Firstly,
the target in the video frame is extracted through the target detection network
to reduce background interference. Then the optical flow map of two adjacent
frames is calculated. Motion features are used multiple targets in the video
frame to construct spatial context simultaneously, re-encoding the target
appearance and motion features, and finally reconstructing the above features
through the spatio-temporal dual-stream network, and using the reconstruction
error to represent the abnormal score. The algorithm achieves frame-level AUCs
of 98.5% and 86.3% on the UCSDped2 and Avenue datasets, respectively. On the
UCSDped2 dataset, the spatio-temporal dual-stream network improves frames by
5.1% and 0.3%, respectively, compared to the temporal and spatial stream
networks. After using spatial context encoding, the frame-level AUC is enhanced

various vision tasks. However, ViTs' self-attention module is still arguably a
major bottleneck, limiting their achievable hardware efficiency. Meanwhile,
existing accelerators dedicated to NLP Transformers are not optimal for ViTs.
This is because there is a large difference between ViTs and NLP Transformers:
ViTs have a relatively fixed number of input tokens, whose attention maps can
be pruned by up to 90% even with fixed sparse patterns; while NLP Transformers
need to handle input sequences of varying numbers of tokens and rely on
on-the-fly predictions of dynamic sparse attention patterns for each input to
achieve a decent sparsity (e.g., >=50%). To this end, we propose a dedicated
algorithm and accelerator co-design framework dubbed ViTCoD for accelerating
ViTs. Specifically, on the algorithm level, ViTCoD prunes and polarizes the
attention maps to have either denser or sparser fixed patterns for regularizing
two levels of workloads without hurting the accuracy, largely reducing the
attention computations while leaving room for alleviating the remaining
dominant data movements; on top of that, we further integrate a lightweight and
learnable auto-encoder module to enable trading the dominant high-cost data
movements for lower-cost computations. On the hardware level, we develop a
dedicated accelerator to simultaneously coordinate the enforced denser/sparser
workloads and encoder/decoder engines for boosted hardware utilization.
Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that ViTCoD largely reduces
the dominant data movement costs, achieving speedups of up to 235.3x, 142.9x,
86.0x, 10.1x, and 6.8x over general computing platforms CPUs, EdgeGPUs, GPUs,

regulators of N7-methylguanosine, and the deregulation of RNMT correlated with
tumor development and immune metabolism. However, the specific function of RNMT
in pan-cancer remains unclear.
  Methods: RNMT expression in different cancers was analyzed using multiple
databases, including Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), Genotype-Tissue
Expression Project (GTEx), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Cox regression
analysis and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to estimate the correlation of
RNMT expression to prognosis. The data was also used to research the
relationship between RNMT expression and common immunoregulators, tumor
mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), mismatch repair (MMR),
and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). Additionally, the cBioPortal website was used
to evaluate the characteristics of RNMT alteration. The TISDB database was used
to obtain the expression of different subtypes. The Tumor Immune Estimation
Resource (TIMER) database was used to analyze the association between RNMT and
tumor immune infiltration. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to
identify the relevant pathways.
  Results: RNMT was ubiquitously highly expressed across cancers and survival
analysis revealed that its expression was highly associated with the clinical
prognosis of various cancer types. Remarkably, RNMT participates in immune
regulation and plays a crucial part in the tumor microenvironment. A positive
association was found between RNMT expression and six immune cell types
expression in colon adenocarcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and
liver hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, RNMT expression was highly associated
with immunoregulators in most cancer types, and correlated to TMB, MSI, MMR,
and DNMT. Finally, GSEA indicated that RNMT may correlate with tumor immunity.

small contrasting density, produced by Faraday instability, is investigated
using direct numerical simulations (DNS). We demonstrate that at lower forcing
amplitudes, the t.k.e. increases with an increase in f till
(f/\omega\right)^2<0.25, where \omega is the forcing frequency, during the
sub-harmonic instability phase. The increase in t.k.e. increases B_V, which
increases the total potential energy (TPE). A portion of TPE is the APE. Some
parts of APE can convert to $t.k.e.$ via B_V, whereas the rest converts to
internal energy, increasing BPE through \phi_i. The remaining TPE also converts
to BPE through the diapycnal flux \phi_d resulting in irreversible mixing. With
the saturation of the instability, irreversible mixing ceases. When
(f/\omega\right)^2 > 0.25, the Coriolis force significantly delays the onset of
the sub-harmonic instabilities. During this period, the initial concentration
profile diffuses to increase TPE, which eventually expends in BPE. The strong
rotational effects suppress t.k.e.. Therefore, B_V and APE become small, and
the bulk of the TPE expends to BPE. Since the instability never saturates for
$\left(f/\omega\right)^2 > 0.25$, the $B_V$ remains non-zero, resulting in a
continuous increase in TPE. Conversion of TPE to BPE via $\phi_d$ continues,
and we find prolonged irreversible mixing. At higher forcing amplitudes, the
stabilizing effect of rotation is negligible, and the turbulence is less
intense and short-lived. Therefore, the irreversible mixing phenomenon also
ends quickly for $\left(f/\omega\right)^2<0.25$. However, when
$\left(f/\omega\right)^2>0.25$ a continuous mixing is observed. We find that
the turbulent mixing is efficient at lower forcing amplitudes and rotation
rates of (f/\omega)^2 > 0.25.

Different forms of localized stationary solutions are obtained and their
properties are analyzed. Using the Vakhitov-Kolokolov stability criterion, the

a resource allocation problem that involves half-duplex transceiver selection,
broadcast coverage optimization, power allocation, and resource block
scheduling. First, to obtain the optimal solution, we formulate the problem as
a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem and then study its NP-hardness.
The NP-hardness result motivates us to design simple solutions. Consequently,
we model the problem as a single-agent Markov decision process to solve the
problem efficiently using fingerprint deep reinforcement learning techniques
such as deep-Q-network (DQN) methods. Nevertheless, applying DQN is not
straightforward due to the curse of dimensionality implied by the large and
mixed action space that contains discrete and continuous optimization
decisions. Therefore, to solve this mixed discrete/continuous problem
efficiently, simply and elegantly, we propose a decomposition technique that
consists of first solving the discrete subproblem using a matching algorithm
based on state-of-the-art stable roommate matching and then solving the
continuous subproblem using DRL algorithm that is based on deep deterministic
policy gradient DDPG. We validate our proposed method through Monte Carlo
simulations where we show that the decomposed matching and DRL algorithm
successfully minimizes the AoI and achieves almost 66% performance gain
compared to the best benchmarks for various vehicles' speeds, transmission
power, or packet sizes. Further, we prove the existence of an optimal value of
broadcast coverage at which the learning algorithm provides the optimal AoI.

three different cases, namely when the propagation direction is perpendicular,

problems. In this paper, by nonsupport point, we present generating spaces
which are relative to a Banach space and a nonsupport point of its convex
closed subset. Then for optimization problems in infinite dimensional spaces,
in some general cases, we replace original spaces by generating spaces while
containing solutions. Thus this method enable us to apply powerful classical
techniques to optimization problems in very general class of infinite

from missing or wrong labeling issues resulting in low precision and low
recall. This paper proposes a novel ultra-fine entity typing model with
denoising capability. Specifically, we build a noise model to estimate the
unknown labeling noise distribution over input contexts and noisy type labels.
With the noise model, more trustworthy labels can be recovered by subtracting
the estimated noise from the input. Furthermore, we propose an entity typing
model, which adopts a bi-encoder architecture, is trained on the denoised data.
Finally, the noise model and entity typing model are trained iteratively to
enhance each other. We conduct extensive experiments on the Ultra-Fine entity
typing dataset as well as OntoNotes dataset and demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms other baseline methods.

and edge devices, reducing the latency of deep learning model inferences
becomes crucial to provide efficient model serving. However, it is challenging
to develop efficient tensor programs for deep learning operators due to the
high complexity of modern accelerators and the rapidly growing number of
operators. Deep learning compilers, such as Apache TVM, adopt declarative
scheduling primitives to lower the bar of developing tensor programs. However,
we show that this approach is insufficient to cover state-of-the-art tensor
program optimizations. In this paper, we propose to embed the scheduling
process into tensor programs and use dedicated mappings, called task mappings,
to define the computation assignment and ordering. This new approach greatly
enriches the expressible optimizations by allowing developers to manipulate
tensor programs at a much finer granularity. We call the proposed method the
task-mapping programming paradigm. In addition, we propose a new
post-scheduling fusion optimization that allows developers to focus on
scheduling every single operator and automates the fusion after scheduling. It
greatly reduces the engineering efforts for operator fusion. Our proposed
paradigm also constructs an efficient hardware-centric schedule space, which is
agnostic to the program input size and greatly reduces the tuning time. With
the proposed paradigm, we implement a deep learning compiler Hidet. Extensive
experiments on modern convolution and transformer models show that Hidet
outperforms state-of-the-art DNN inference framework, ONNX Runtime, and
compiler, TVM equipped with scheduler AutoTVM and Ansor, by up to 1.48x (1.22x

multi-exposure image fusion (MEF) technology has abounded. In recent years,
multi-scale exposure fusion approaches based on detail-enhancement have led the
way for improvement in highlight and shadow details. Most of such methods,
however, are too computationally expensive to be deployed on mobile devices.
This paper presents a perceptual multi-exposure fusion method that not just

detailenhanced methods. We analyze the potential defects of three classical
exposure measures in lieu of using detail-enhancement component and improve two
of them, namely adaptive Wellexposedness (AWE) and the gradient of color images

protocol for RIS-assisted channels. The new design uses a modified DFT matrix
(MDFT) for the training phases at the RIS and is shown to minimize the total
channel estimation error variance. In conjunction with interpolation
(estimating fewer RIS channels), the MDFT approach accelerates channel
estimation even when the channel from base station to RIS is line-of-sight. In
contrast, prior two-stage techniques required a full-rank channel for efficient
estimation. We investigate the resulting channel estimation errors by comparing
different training phase designs for a variety of propagation conditions using
a ray-based channel model. To examine the overall performance, we simulate the
spectral efficiency with MRC processing for a single-user RIS-assisted system
using an existing optimal design for the RIS transmission phases. Results
verify the optimality of MDFT while simulations and analysis show that the
performance is more dependent on the user-to-RIS channel correlation and the
coarseness of the interpolation used, rather than the training phase design.
For example, under a scenario with more highly correlated channels, the
procedure accelerates channel estimation by a factor of 16, while the
improvement is a factor of 5 in a less correlated case. The overall procedure
is extremely robust, with a maximum performance loss of 1.5bits/sec/Hz compared

state-of-the-art methods have achieved, challenges remain in clinical
scenarios. For boosting the clinical deployment of fundus image enhancement,
this paper proposes the pyramid constraint to develop a degradation-invariant
enhancement network (PCE-Net), which mitigates the demand for clinical data and
stably enhances unknown data. Firstly, high-quality images are randomly
degraded to form sequences of low-quality ones sharing the same content
(SeqLCs). Then individual low-quality images are decomposed to Laplacian
pyramid features (LPF) as the multi-level input for the enhancement.
Subsequently, a feature pyramid constraint (FPC) for the sequence is introduced
to enforce the PCE-Net to learn a degradation-invariant model. Extensive
experiments have been conducted under the evaluation metrics of enhancement and
segmentation. The effectiveness of the PCE-Net was demonstrated in comparison
with state-of-the-art methods and the ablation study. The source code of this

Strain-induced tuning of magnetic interactions in rare earth cobaltates and

transport properties. Here we reported the spin re-orientation induced
switching of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and its tunability with strain
in epitaxial LaCo$_{0.5}$Ni$_{0.5}$O$_{3-\delta}$ thin films across the
ferromagnetic transition. Moreover, with strain tuning, we could observe a
two-fold to four-fold symmetry crossover in AMR across the magnetic transition
temperature. The magnetization measurements revealed an onset of ferromagnetic
transition around 50 K, and a further reduction in temperature showed a subtle
change in the magnetization dynamics, which reduced the ferromagnetic
long-range ordering and introduced glassiness in the system. X-ray absorption
and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy measurements over Co and Ni
L edges revealed the Co spin state transition below the magnetic transition
temperature leading to the AMR switching and also the presence of Ni$^{2+}$ and

remarkable results on various node classification tasks. Nevertheless, the
recursive nodes fetching and aggregation in message-passing cause inference
latency when deploying GNNs to large-scale graphs. One promising inference
acceleration direction is to distill the GNNs into message-passing-free student
multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). However, the MLP student cannot fully learn the
structure knowledge due to the lack of structure inputs, which causes inferior
performance in the heterophily and inductive scenarios. To address this, we
intend to inject structure information into MLP-like students in low-latency
and interpretable ways. Specifically, we first design a Structure-Aware MLP
(SA-MLP) student that encodes both features and structures without
message-passing. Then, we introduce a novel structure-mixing knowledge
distillation strategy to enhance the learning ability of MLPs for structure

condensed matter physics. Exciting recent examples are the higher-order

various lattices and can hold a finite superfluid density, bounded by the Chern

properties of flat bands in the superconducting state. We argue that the
topological superconductivity induced in a flat band with $C=n$ is of order $n$
and the associated boundary Majorana states have a complex structure when
$n>1$. As example, we show that an attractive interaction in the dice lattice,
that exhibits flat bands with $C=2$, gives rise to second-order topological
superconductivity with mixed singlet-triplet pairing. The second-order nature
of the topological superconducting phase is revealed by the zero-energy
Majorana bound states at the lattice corners. These findings suggest that flat

  Detection","Accepted by ECCV 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-modal 3D object detection has been an active research topic in
autonomous driving. Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to explore the cross-modal
feature fusion between sparse 3D points and dense 2D pixels. Recent approaches
either fuse the image features with the point cloud features that are projected
onto the 2D image plane or combine the sparse point cloud with dense image
pixels. These fusion approaches often suffer from severe information loss, thus
causing sub-optimal performance. To address these problems, we construct the
homogeneous structure between the point cloud and images to avoid projective
information loss by transforming the camera features into the LiDAR 3D space.
In this paper, we propose a homogeneous multi-modal feature fusion and
interaction method (HMFI) for 3D object detection. Specifically, we first
design an image voxel lifter module (IVLM) to lift 2D image features into the
3D space and generate homogeneous image voxel features. Then, we fuse the
voxelized point cloud features with the image features from different regions
by introducing the self-attention based query fusion mechanism (QFM). Next, we
propose a voxel feature interaction module (VFIM) to enforce the consistency of
semantic information from identical objects in the homogeneous point cloud and
image voxel representations, which can provide object-level alignment guidance
for cross-modal feature fusion and strengthen the discriminative ability in
complex backgrounds. We conduct extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo
Open Dataset, and the proposed HMFI achieves better performance compared with
the state-of-the-art multi-modal methods. Particularly, for the 3D detection of
cyclist on the KITTI benchmark, HMFI surpasses all the published algorithms by
a large margin.

fine-tune the bottom model, and gets quite good performance. To prevent such

($\Sigma_{\rm SFR} \propto \Sigma_{\rm gas}^N$). We find tight power-law
correlations between the SFR and the gas (H I, H$_2$, and the total gas) in
both volume and surface densities. The power-law indices of the total gas and H

benefits in comparison to step-based RL. It generates smooth control

so far hampered the effective use of deep RL methods. In this paper, we present
a new algorithm for deep ERL. It is based on differentiable trust region
layers, a successful on-policy deep RL algorithm. These layers allow us to
specify trust regions for the policy update that are solved exactly for each
state using convex optimization, which enables policies learning with the high
precision required for the ERL. We compare our ERL algorithm to
state-of-the-art step-based algorithms in many complex simulated robotic

on dense rewards, ERL performs favorably on sparse and non-Markovian rewards.
Moreover, our results show that the sparse and the non-Markovian rewards are

Lanczos/Arnoldi exact diagonalization (ED) or matrix product states (MPS).
While the mapping becomes exponentially more accurate with increasing number of

the Hilbert space dimension for open systems, and the MPS solver typically
requires rather long runtimes. Here, we propose to adopt a configuration
interaction approach augmented by active space extension to solve numerically
the correlated auxiliary open quantum system. This allows access to a larger
number of bath sites at lower computational costs than for plain ED. We
benchmark the approach with numerical renormalization group results in
equilibrium and with MPS out of equilibrium. In particular, we evaluate the
current, the conductance as well as the Kondo peak and its splitting as a
function of increasing bias voltage below the Kondo temperature TK. We obtain a
rather accurate scaling of the conductance as a function of the bias voltage
and temperature rescaled by TK for moderate to strong interactions in a wide

privacy protection, and deep neural networks (DNN) have been immensely
successful in machine learning. The combination of these two techniques, i.e.,
deep learning with differential privacy, promises the privacy-preserving
release of high-utility models trained with sensitive data such as medical
records. A classic mechanism for this purpose is DP-SGD, which is a
differentially private version of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
optimizer commonly used for DNN training. Subsequent approaches have improved
various aspects of the model training process, including noise decay schedule,
model architecture, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning. However,
the core mechanism for enforcing DP in the SGD optimizer remains unchanged ever
since the original DP-SGD algorithm, which has increasingly become a
fundamental barrier limiting the performance of DP-compliant machine learning
solutions.
  Motivated by this, we propose DPIS, a novel mechanism for differentially
private SGD training that can be used as a drop-in replacement of the core
optimizer of DP-SGD, with consistent and significant accuracy gains over the
latter. The main idea is to employ importance sampling (IS) in each SGD
iteration for mini-batch selection, which reduces both sampling variance and
the amount of random noise injected to the gradients that is required to
satisfy DP. Integrating IS into the complex mathematical machinery of DP-SGD is
highly non-trivial. DPIS addresses the challenge through novel mechanism
designs, fine-grained privacy analysis, efficiency enhancements, and an
adaptive gradient clipping optimization. Extensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets, namely MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10 and IMDb, demonstrate the
superior effectiveness of DPIS over existing solutions for deep learning with
differential privacy.

map of an unknown environment and localizes the position of a moving agent on
the map simultaneously. Extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been widely adopted as
a low complexity solution for online SLAM, which relies on a motion and
measurement model of the moving agent. In practice, however, acquiring precise
information about these models is very challenging, and the model mismatch
effect causes severe performance loss in SLAM. In this paper, inspired by the
recently proposed KalmanNet, we present a robust EKF algorithm using the power
of deep learning for online SLAM, referred to as Split-KalmanNet. The key idea
of Split-KalmanNet is to compute the Kalman gain using the Jacobian matrix of a
measurement function and two recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The two RNNs
independently learn the covariance matrices for a prior state estimate and the
innovation from data. The proposed split structure in the computation of the
Kalman gain allows to compensate for state and measurement model mismatch
effects independently. Numerical simulation results verify that Split-KalmanNet
outperforms the traditional EKF and the state-of-the-art KalmanNet algorithm in
various model mismatch scenarios.

existing papers build their generators by stacking up multiple residual blocks
since it makes ease the training of generators. However, some recent papers
commented on the limitation of the residual block and proposed a new
architectural unit that improves the GANs performance. Following this trend,
this paper presents a novel unit, called feature cycling block (FCB), which
achieves impressive results in the image generation task. Specifically, the FCB
has two branches: one is a memory branch and the other is an image branch. The
memory branch keeps meaningful information at each stage of the generator,
whereas the image branch takes some useful features from the memory branch to
produce a high-quality image. To show the capability of the proposed method, we
conducted extensive experiments using various datasets including CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, FFHQ, AFHQ, and subsets of LSUN. Experimental results demonstrate
the substantial superiority of our approach over the baseline without incurring

improves Frechet inception distance (FID) of StyleGAN2 from 4.89 to 3.72 on the

theories intensively used over the last fifty years to explain static and
dynamic phenomena that classical elasticity fails to do. The nonlocal elastic
theory has a clear differentiation from the classical case by considering
stresses in a point of the continuum as an integral of all stresses defined in
the treated elastic body. On the other hand, strain gradient elasticity is
characterized as a non-classical theory because considers both potential and
kinetic energy densities as not only functions of strains and velocities,
respectively but also functions of their gradients. Although the two
considerations seem to be completely different from each other, it is a common
belief that strain gradient elasticity has a lot in common with nonlocal
elasticity. The goal of the present work is to derive all the strain gradient
elastic theories appearing so far in the literature via nonlocal definitions of
the potential and kinetic energy densities. Such a derivation demonstrates the
common roots of the two theories and explains the nature of the involved
intrinsic parameters in strain gradient elastic theories. For the sake of
simplicity and brevity, only one-dimensional wave propagation phenomena are
considered.

performance in improving the adversarial robustness. However, diffusion-type

the MARL agents easily overfit the training environment and perform poorly in
the evaluation scenarios where other agents behave differently. Obtaining
generalizable policies for MARL agents is thus necessary but challenging mainly
due to complex multi-agent interactions. In this work, we model the problem
with Markov Games and propose a simple yet effective method, ranked policy
memory (RPM), to collect diverse multi-agent trajectories for training MARL
policies with good generalizability. The main idea of RPM is to maintain a
look-up memory of policies. In particular, we try to acquire various levels of
behaviors by saving policies via ranking the training episode return, i.e., the
episode return of agents in the training environment; when an episode starts,
the learning agent can then choose a policy from the RPM as the behavior
policy. This innovative self-play training framework leverages agents' past
policies and guarantees the diversity of multi-agent interaction in the
training data. We implement RPM on top of MARL algorithms and conduct extensive
experiments on Melting Pot. It has been demonstrated that RPM enables MARL
agents to interact with unseen agents in multi-agent generalization evaluation
scenarios and complete given tasks, and it significantly boosts the performance
up to 402% on average.

proposals, e.g., the volume of the maximal slice and the action or spacetime

conventional soft conductors are inherently characterized by a large change in
conductance upon mechanical deformation or under alternating environmental
conditions, e.g., humidity, drastically limiting their application potential
and performance. Here, we demonstrate a novel concept for the development of
strain-invariant, fatigue resistant and highly water stable soft conductor. By
combining different thin film technologies in a three-dimensional fashion, we
develop nano- and micro-engineered, multi-layered (< 50 nm), ultra-lightweight
(< 15 mg/cm$^3$) foam-like composite framework structures based on PEDOT:PSS
and PTFE. The all-organic composite framework structures are characterized by
conductivities of up to 184 S/m, remaining strain-invariant between 80 %
compressive and 25 % tensile strain. We further show, that the multi-layered
composites are characterized by properties that surpass that of framework
structures based on the individual materials. Both, the initial electrical and
mechanical properties of the composite framework structures are retained during
long-term cycling, even after 2000 cycles at 50 % compression. Furthermore, the
PTFE functionalization renders the framework structure highly hydrophobic,
resulting in stable electrical properties, even when immersed in water for up

strain-invariant soft conductors and demonstrates for the first time a
versatile approach for the development of innovative multi-scaled and
multi-layered functional materials, for applications in soft electronics,

through various methods, e.g., generator tuning or feature mixing. While those

this paper, we point out that the existing GAN inversion models have inherent
limitations in both structural and training aspects, which preclude the
delicate reconstruction of high-frequency features. Especially, we prove that
the widely-used loss term in GAN inversion, i.e., L2, is biased to reconstruct
low-frequency features mainly. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel GAN
inversion model, coined WaGI, which enables to handle high-frequency features
explicitly, by using a novel wavelet-based loss term and a newly proposed
wavelet fusion scheme. To the best of our knowledge, WaGI is the first attempt
to interpret GAN inversion in the frequency domain. We demonstrate that WaGI
shows outstanding results on both inversion and editing, compared to the
existing state-of-the-art GAN inversion models. Especially, WaGI robustly
preserves high-frequency features of images even in the editing scenario. We

of fluid could influence the electrokinetic instability (EKI) phenomenon in a
microfluidic T-junction. The non-Newtonian power-law model with different
values of the power-law index (n) is used to obtain fluids of different
rheological behaviours. We find that as the fluid rheological behaviour changes
from shear-thickening (n > 1) to shear-thinning (n < 1) via the Newtonian (n =
1) one, the EKI phenomenon is significantly influenced under the same
conditions. In particular, the intensity of this EKI phenomenon is found to be
significantly higher in shear-thinning fluids than in Newtonian and
shear-thickening fluids. As a result, the corresponding mixing phenomenon,
often achieved using this EKI phenomenon, is also notably enhanced in
shear-thinning fluids compared to that achieved in Newtonian and
shear-thickening fluids. A detailed analysis of both the flow dynamics and
mixing phenomena in terms of streamlines, velocity fluctuations, concentration
field, mixing efficiency, etc., is presented and discussed in this study. We
also employ the data-driven dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) technique to
analyze the flow field in more detail. In particular, the information on the
coherent flow structures obtained with different values of the power-law index
facilitates the understanding of both the EKI-induced chaotic convection and
mixing phenomena in a better way; for instance, why the mixing efficiency is
higher in shear-thinning fluids than that in Newtonian and shear-thickening
fluids. Moreover, we observe that the spatial expanse and intensity of these
coherent structures differ significantly as the power-law index changes,
thereby providing valuable insights into certain aspects of the underlying flow
dynamics that otherwise are not clearly apparent from other analyses.

'Hubble constant' -- has been a topic of controversy since the first measure of
its expansion by Edwin Hubble in the 1920's. As early as the 1970's, Sandage et
de Vaucouleurs have been arguing about the adequate methodology for such a
measurement. Should astronomers focus only on their best indicators, e.g., the
Cepheids, and improve the precision of this measurement based on a unique
object to the best possible? Or should they 'spread the risks', i.e., multiply
the indicators and methodologies before averaging over their results? Is a
robust agreement across several uncertain measures, as is currently argued to
defend the existence of a 'Hubble crisis' more telling than a single one
percent precision measurement? This controversy, I argue, stems from a
misconception of what managing the uncertainties associated with such
experimental measurements require. Astrophysical measurements, such as the
measure of the Hubble constant, require a methodology that permits both to
reduce the known uncertainties and to track the unknown unknowns. Based on the
lessons drawn from the so-called Hubble crisis, I sketch a methodological guide
for identifying, quantifying and reducing uncertainties in astrophysical
measurements, hoping that such a guide can not only help to re-frame the
current Hubble tension, but serve as a starting point for future fruitful
discussions between astrophysicists, astronomers and philosophers.

3D radiation-hydrodynamics numerical simulations for young massive stars formed
out of collapsing 100 Mo molecular cores spinning with several values of the
ratio of rotational-to-gravitational energies beta=5%-9%. The models include
the indirect gravitational potential caused by disc asymmetries. We find that
this modifies the barycenter of the disc, causing significant excursions of the
central star position, which we term stellar wobbling. The stellar wobbling
slows down and protracts the development of gravitational instability in the
disc, reducing the number and magnitude of the accretion-driven bursts
undergone by the young massive stars, whose properties are in good agreement
with that of the burst monitored from the massive protostar M17 MIR. Including
stellar wobbling is therefore important for accurate modeling disc structures.
Synthetic ALMA interferometric images in the millimeter waveband show that the
outcomes of efficient gravitational instability such as spiral arms and gaseous
clumps can be detected for as long as the disc is old enough and has already
entered the burst mode of accretion.

created hypothetical random genetic codes have suggested that the SGC has been

only a small subspace of the possible code space due to limitations in

applying multicanonical Monte Carlo, an efficient rare-event sampling method,

a variety of driven athermal microstructural reactions including the enhanced

distillation techniques that push performance frontiers across multiple

state-of-the-art results on the specific problem. However, there has been a
significant gap in understanding the process and how it behaves under certain

in training neural networks on a limited dataset faster by reusing
representations learned from a different but related problem. Despite its

networks. To enable training of deep monocular estimation models with various

strategies to generate affine-invariant depth representations. However,
learning with image-level normalization mainly emphasizes the relations of
pixel representations with the global statistic in the images, such as the
structure of the scene, while the fine-grained depth difference may be
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale depth normalization
method that hierarchically normalizes the depth representations based on
spatial information and depth distributions. Compared with previous
normalization strategies applied only at the holistic image level, the proposed
hierarchical normalization can effectively preserve the fine-grained details
and improve accuracy. We present two strategies that define the hierarchical
normalization contexts in the depth domain and the spatial domain,
respectively. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed normalization
strategy remarkably outperforms previous normalization methods, and we set new
state-of-the-art on five zero-shot transfer benchmark datasets.

by adding bounded perturbations to a randomly selected subset of training data

bounded perturbations, only a number of poisons can be optimized to have a
gradient that is close enough to that of the target and make the attack
successful; (ii) such effective poisons move away from their original class and
get isolated in the gradient space; (iii) dropping examples in low-density
gradient regions during training can successfully eliminate the effective
poisons, and guarantees similar training dynamics to that of training on full

problem inherent in recommender systems is amplified in group recommendation
because interaction data between groups and items are extremely scarce in

mitigate the data scarcity problem. However, existing approaches inevitably
fail in extreme cold-start scenarios where associations between groups and
items are lacking. For this reason, we design a group recommendation model for
EXreme cold-star} in group REcommendation (EXTRE) suitable for the extreme cold

convolutional neural networks to establish implicit associations between groups
and items, and the derivation of these associations does not require explicit
interaction data, making it suitable for cold start scenarios. The training
process of EXTRE depends on the newly defined and interpretable concepts of

dependence on stellar mass and star formation rate in EAGLE are in good
agreement with observations. Galaxies hosted by haloes of similar virial mass,
$\rm M_{200}$, have similar $\sigma_z$ values even in runs where feedback is
absent. The prevalence of local instabilities in discs is uncorrelated with
$\sigma_z$ at low redshift and becomes only weakly correlated at high redshifts
and in galaxies hosted by massive haloes. $\sigma_z$ correlates most strongly
with the specific gas accretion rate onto the disc as well as with the degree
of misalignment between the inflowing gas and the disc's rotation axis. These
correlations are significant across all redshifts and halo masses, with
misaligned accretion being the primary driver of high gas turbulence at
redshifts $z \lesssim 1$ and for halo masses $\rm M_{200} \lesssim 10^{11.5}

Even though quantum error correction can theoretically remedy this problem, its

Here, we suggest the application of the so-called quantum state matching
protocol for testing purposes. This protocol was originally proposed to
determine if an unknown quantum state falls in a prescribed neighborhood of a
reference state. We decompose the unitary specific to the protocol and
construct the quantum circuit implementing one step of the dynamics for
different characteristic parameters of the scheme and present test results for
two different IBM quantum computers. By comparing the experimentally obtained
relative frequencies of success to the ideal success probability with a maximum
statistical tolerance, we discriminate statistical errors from device specific
ones. For the characterization of noise, we also use the fact that while the
output of the ideal protocol is insensitive to the internal phase of the input
state, the actual implementation may lead to deviations. For systematically
varied inputs we find that the device with the smaller quantum volume performs
better on our tests than the one with larger quantum volume, while for random

thermoelasticity. The absence of a correlation between friction and the thermal

whether to schedule the source or not in order to receive the new status
updates in such a way as to minimize the Mean Age of Incorrect Information
(MAoII). When the scheduler knows the source parameters, we formulate the
minimization problem as an MDP problem. Then, we prove that the optimal
solution is a threshold-based policy. When the source's parameters are unknown,
the problem's difficulty lies in finding a strategy with a good trade-off
between exploitation and exploration. Indeed, we need to provide an algorithm
implemented by the scheduler that jointly estimates the unknown parameters
(exploration) and minimizes the MAoII (exploitation). However, considering our
system model, we can only explore the source if the monitor decides to schedule
it. Then, applying the greedy approach, we risk definitively stopping the
exploration process in the case where at a specific time, we end up with an
estimation of the Markovian source's parameters to which the corresponding
optimal solution is never to transmit. In this case, we can no longer improve
the estimation of our unknown parameters, which may significantly detract from
the performance of the algorithm. For that, we develop a new learning algorithm
that gives a good balance between exploration and exploitation to avoid this
main problem. Then, we theoretically analyze the performance of our algorithm
compared to a genie solution by proving that the regret bound at time T is
log(T). Finally, we provide some numerical results to highlight the performance

weighted compactness for commutators of specific multilinear operators on

strike a balance between time-differentiated signals, revenue stability for the
utility, limited grid costs for vulnerable households, and promoting
electrification. We simulate the impacts of this combination on 1.4 million
Danish households (about 50% of the country's population) and quantify the
cross-subsidization effects between groups. With its unique level of detail,
this study stresses the spillover effects of tariffs. We show that a

infrared spectroscopy, we show that particle hydrophobicity increases with
increasing suspension temperature and decreasing particle stiffness. Our
frequency and strain amplitude sweep rheology experiments reveal that the
linear viscoelastic moduli and yield stresses of dense PNIPAM suspensions,
constituted by particles of varying stiffnesses, increase when temperature is
raised above the lower consolute solution temperature (LCST). Combining our
cryogenic scanning electron microscopy and rheology data, we report that dense
suspensions of the softest PNIPAM hydrogels show a gel-liquid-gel transition
when temperature is increased across the LCST. Suspensions of stiff particles,
in contrast, exhibit a glass-glass transition across the LCST without going
through an intermediate liquid state. Our observations reveal that the
temperature-induced phase transformations in dense PNIPAM suspensions depend
sensitively on the stiffness of the constituent particles and can be explained
by considering hydrophobicity-driven morphological changes in the suspension
microstructures over the experimental temperature range. We can therefore
achieve a variety of suspension phases with unique properties by tuning just

based on optical colour is strongly linked to HI gas properties. To examine
environmental impacts on the HI gas content of galaxies, three sub-samples are
made based on the GAMA group catalogue. The average HI mass of group central
galaxies is larger than those of satellite and isolated galaxies, but with a
lower HI gas fraction. We derive a variety of HI scaling relations for physical
properties of our sample, including stellar mass, stellar mass surface density,
$NUV-r$ colour, specific star formation rate, and halo mass. We find that the
derived HI scaling relations are comparable to other published results, with
consistent trends also observed to $\sim$0.5 dex lower limits in stellar mass
and stellar surface density. The cosmic HI densities derived from our data are
consistent with other published values at similar redshifts. DINGO early

detection aims at finding the relevant parts of the image that change over
time. Although Deep Learning (DL) shows promising performances in similar
change detection tasks, the creation of large annotated datasets represents a
major bottleneck for supervised DL applications in radiology. To overcome this,
we propose a combined use of weak labels (imprecise, but fast-to-create
annotations) and Transfer Learning (TL). Specifically, we explore inductive TL,
where source and target domains are identical, but tasks are different due to a
label shift: our target labels are created manually by three radiologists,
whereas our source weak labels are generated automatically from radiology
reports via NLP. We frame knowledge transfer as hyperparameter optimization,
thus avoiding heuristic choices that are frequent in related works. We
investigate the relationship between model size and TL, comparing a
low-capacity VGG with a higher-capacity ResNeXt model. We evaluate our models
on 1693 T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging difference maps created from 183
patients, by classifying them into stable or unstable according to tumor
evolution. The weak labels extracted from radiology reports allowed us to
increase dataset size more than 3-fold, and improve VGG classification results
from 75% to 82% AUC. Mixed training from scratch led to higher performance than
fine-tuning or feature extraction. To assess generalizability, we ran inference
on an open dataset (BraTS-2015: 15 patients, 51 difference maps), reaching up
to 76% AUC. Overall, results suggest that medical imaging problems may benefit
from smaller models and different TL strategies with respect to computer vision
datasets, and that report-generated weak labels are effective in improving
model performances. Code, in-house dataset and BraTS labels are released.

  Reasoning","Full paper of EMNLP 2022 Findings",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is a sequence of KGs with respective
timestamps, which adopts quadruples in the form of (\emph{subject},
\emph{relation}, \emph{object}, \emph{timestamp}) to describe dynamic facts.
TKG reasoning has facilitated many real-world applications via answering such
queries as (\emph{query entity}, \emph{query relation}, \emph{?}, \emph{future
timestamp}) about future. This is actually a matching task between a query and
candidate entities based on their historical structures, which reflect
behavioral trends of the entities at different timestamps. In addition, recent
KGs provide background knowledge of all the entities, which is also helpful for
the matching. Thus, in this paper, we propose the \textbf{Hi}storical
\textbf{S}tructure \textbf{Match}ing (\textbf{HiSMatch}) model. It applies two
structure encoders to capture the semantic information contained in the
historical structures of the query and candidate entities. Besides, it adopts
another encoder to integrate the background knowledge into the model. TKG
reasoning experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant
improvement of the proposed HiSMatch model, with up to 5.6\% performance
improvement in MRR, compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.

distributions. This situation is commonly referred as a dataset shift. The most
common settings for dataset shift often considered in the literature are {\em
covariate shift } and {\em target shift}. Importance weighting (IW) correction
is a universal method for correcting the bias present in learning scenarios
under dataset shift. The question one may ask is: does IW correction work
equally well for different dataset shift scenarios? By investigating the
generalization properties of the weighted kernel ridge regression (W-KRR) under
covariate and target shifts we show that the answer is negative, except when IW
is bounded and the model is wellspecified. In the latter cases, a minimax
optimal rates are achieved by importance weighted kernel ridge regression
(IW-KRR) in both, covariate and target shift scenarios. Slightly relaxing the
boundedness condition of the IW we show that the IW-KRR still achieves the
optimal rates under target shift while leading to slower rates for covariate
shift. In the case of the model misspecification we show that the performance
of the W-KRR under covariate shift could be substantially increased by
designing an alternative reweighting function. The distinction between
misspecified and wellspecified scenarios does not seem to be crucial in the
learning problems under target shift.

flares are thought to originate in similar physical processes and differ only

We search for characteristics of flares on active giants, which might be
statistically different from those on main-sequence stars. We used nearly 4000
flares of 61 giants and 20 stars of other types that were observed with Kepler
in long-cadence mode, which is the only suitable database for this comparative
study. For every flare, we derived the duration and energy and gathered stellar
parameters. Correlations between the flare characteristics and various stellar
parameters were investigated. Strong correlations are found between the flare
duration and the surface gravity, luminosity, and radii of the stars. Scaled
flare shapes appear to be similar on giants and dwarfs with a 30 min cadence.
The logarithmic relation of flare energy and duration is steeper for stars with
lower surface gravity. Observed flares are longer and more energetic on giants
than on dwarfs on average. The generalized linear scaling for the logarithmic
relation of flare energy and duration with a universal theoretical slope of
$\approx$1/3 should slightly be modified by introducing a dependence on surface
gravity.

as well as their impact on the data analysis process through the end-to-end
simulations of CMB experiment. We track their performance by analyzing the
response of different components of the data, including both signals and noise.
In the time domain, the calculation shows that the high-pass filter has the
smallest root mean square error and can achieve high filtering efficiency,
followed by the Wiener filter and polynomial filter. We then perform map-making
with the filtered time ordered data (TOD) to trace the effects from filters on
the map domain, and the results show that the polynomial filter gives high
noise residual at low frequency, which gives rise to serious leakage to small
scales in map domain during the map-making process, while the high-pass filter
and Wiener filter do not have such significant leakage. Then we estimate the
angular power spectra of residual noise, as well as those of the input signal
for comparing the filter effects in the power spectra domain. Finally, we
estimate the standard deviation of the filter corrected power spectra to
compare the effects from different filters, and the results show that, at low
noise level, the three filters give almost comparable standard deviations on
the medium and small scales, but at high noise level, the standard deviation of
the polynomial filter is significantly larger. These studies can be used for
the reduction of atmospheric noise in future ground-based CMB data processing.

sweep up ambient magnetic fields and form stretched and draped configurations
of magnetic fields around them. Many earlier numerical studies adopt
spherically symmetric uniform-density clouds as initial conditions for
simplicity. However, observations demonstrate that HVCs are clumpy and
turbulent. In this paper, we perform 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to
study the evolution of clouds with initial density distributions described by
power-law spatial power spectra. We systematically study the role of (i) the
initial density structure, (ii) halo magnetic fields, and (iii) radiative
cooling efficiency upon infalling HVCs. We find that (i) the clouds' density
structure regulates mixing and mass growth. Uniform clouds grow from the onset
of the simulations while clumpy clouds initially lose gas and then grow at
later times. Along the same lines, the growth curve of clumpy clouds depends on
the slope of the initial density power spectra. (ii) Magnetic fields suppress
hydrodynamic instabilities and the growth of small-scale structures. As a
result, magnetized clouds develop long filaments extended along the streaming
direction whereas non-magnetized clouds are fragmented into many small clumps.
(iii) Efficient cooling keeps the main cloud body more compact and produces
decelerated dense clumps condensed from the halo gas. This work potentially
helps us understand and predict the observed properties of HVCs such as the
detectability of magnetized clouds, the presence of decelerated HI structures
associated with HVC complexes and small-scale features, and a possible link
between the origin and the fate of HVCs.

and only if the true value of the hypothesis follows the text. Classical
approaches generally utilize the feature value of each word from word embedding
to represent the sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
identifying the textual entailment relationship between text and hypothesis,
thereby introducing a new semantic feature focusing on empirical
threshold-based semantic text representation. We employ an element-wise
Manhattan distance vector-based feature that can identify the semantic
entailment relationship between the text-hypothesis pair. We carried out
several experiments on a benchmark entailment classification(SICK-RTE) dataset.
We train several machine learning(ML) algorithms applying both semantic and
lexical features to classify the text-hypothesis pair as entailment, neutral,
or contradiction. Our empirical sentence representation technique enriches the
semantic information of the texts and hypotheses found to be more efficient
than the classical ones. In the end, our approach significantly outperforms
known methods in understanding the meaning of the sentences for the textual

H_0 directly which should help to ease the existing Hubble tension. However, if
the source has a relative velocity to the expanding universe on top of its
motion due to the Hubble flow, a relativistic redshift affects the redshift of
the EM counterpart and the apparent distance of the GW source, and thus it
needs to be corrected to obtain accurate measurements. We study the effect of
such a relative velocity on GWs for a source in an expanding universe showing
that the total redshift of the wave is equal to the product of the relativistic
redshift and the cosmological redshift. We, further, find that a relative
velocity of the source changes its apparent distance by a factor (1+z_rel)^2 in
contrast to a linear factor for the cosmological redshift. We discuss that the
additional factor for the relativistic redshift is a consequence of a
velocity-dependent amplitude for GWs. We consider the effect of the relative
velocity on the chirp mass and the apparent distance of the source an observer
would infer when ignoring this velocity. We find that for different
astrophysical scenarios the error can range between 0.1 % and 7 % for the chirp
mass while the error in the apparent distance can be between 0.25 % and 15 %.
Furthermore, we consider the error introduced in the measurement of H_0 using
standard sirens for two cases: (i) when the effect of velocity on the redshift
of the EM counterpart is considered but not on the apparent distance obtained
from GWs and (ii) when the effect of the relative velocity is ignored
completely. We find that in the first case the error can reach 1 % for a source
moving due to the peculiar velocity of its host galaxy and that in the second
case the error can be more than 5 % for a source at the distance of GW150914

result, the user's familiarity with and trust in the robot as a dialogue
partner and the level of dialogue satisfaction decrease. In this study, we
constructed a travel agent dialogue system focusing on improving the sense of
dialogue participation. At the beginning of the dialogue, the robot tells the
user the purpose of the upcoming dialogue and indicates that it is responsible
for assisting the user in making decisions. In addition, in situations where
users were asked to state their preferences, the robot encourages them to
express their intentions with actions, as well as spoken language responses. In
addition, we attempted to reduce the sense of discomfort felt toward the
android robot by devising a timing control for the robot's detailed movements

long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), star-forming galaxies and quasars. GRBs
took a temporary lead with the discovery of GRB 090423 at a redshift z=8.2, but
now the record-holder is the galaxy GN-z11 at z=11.0. Despite this record,
galaxies and quasars are very faint (GN-z11 has a magnitude H=26), hampering
the study of the physical properties of the primordial Universe. On the other
hand, GRB afterglows are brighter by a factor of >100, with the drawback of
lasting only for 1-2 days. Here we describe a novel approach to the discovery
of high-redshift (z>6) GRBs, exploiting their near-infrared (nIR) emission
properties. Soon after the bright, high-energy prompt phase, a GRB is
accompanied by an afterglow. The afterglows of high-redshift GRBs are naturally
absorbed, like any other source, at optical wavelengths by Hydrogen along the
line of sight in the intergalactic medium (Lyman-alpha absorption). We propose
to take advantage of the deep monitoring of the sky by the Vera Rubin
Observatory, to simultaneously observe exactly the same fields with a new,
dedicated nIR facility. By comparing the two streams of transients, one can
pinpoint transients detected in the nIR band and not in the optical band. These
fast transients detected only in the nIR and with an AB colour index r-H>3.5
are high-redshift GRBs, with a low contamination rate. Thanks to the depth
reached by the Rubin observations, interlopers can be identified, allowing us
to discover ~11 GRBs at z>6 per year and ~3 GRBs per year at z>10. This turns
out to be one of the most effective probes of the high-redshift Universe.

found important applications in adversarial training and other multi-agent
learning settings. Yet, no known gradient descent-based method is guaranteed to
converge to (even local notions of) min-max equilibrium in the
nonconvex-nonconcave setting. For all known methods, there exist relatively
simple objectives for which they cycle or exhibit other undesirable behavior
different from converging to a point, let alone to some game-theoretically
meaningful one~\cite{flokas2019poincare,hsieh2021limits}. The only known
convergence guarantees hold under the strong assumption that the initialization
is very close to a local min-max equilibrium~\cite{wang2019solving}. Moreover,
the afore-described challenges are not just theoretical curiosities. All known
methods are unstable in practice, even in simple settings.
  We propose the first method that is guaranteed to converge to a local min-max
equilibrium for smooth nonconvex-nonconcave objectives. Our method is
second-order and provably escapes limit cycles as long as it is initialized at
an easy-to-find initial point. Both the definition of our method and its
convergence analysis are motivated by the topological nature of the problem. In
particular, our method is not designed to decrease some potential function,
such as the distance of its iterate from the set of local min-max equilibria or
the projected gradient of the objective, but is designed to satisfy a
topological property that guarantees the avoidance of cycles and implies its
convergence.

equatorial ring that surrounds the central binary at a projected distance of 2
arcsec, delineating the inner rims of the butterfly-shaped dusty region. The
formation of silicon-bearing compounds is presumably related to the continuous
recycling of dust due to the variable wind regime of Eta Car, that destroys
grains and releases silicon back to gas phase. We discuss possible formation
routes for the observed species, contextualizing them within the current
molecular inventory of Eta Car. We find that the SiO and SiS fractional

kpc) closer to the Galactic Centre. We took advantage of the precise Gaia and
Skymapper surveys to select Sun-like candidates in a 2-degree field, which were
observed with the HERMES spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We
successfully built up the required signal-to-noise ratio (25-per-pixel in the
HERMES red band) for most targets as faint as Gaia G of 17.4 mag. The stellar
photometric/astrometric parameters (e.g., \teff, \logg, mass) of our candidates
are derived in this paper, while the spectroscopic parameters will be presented
in the third paper in this SDST series. The selection success rate - the
fraction of targets which belong to solar twins or analogues - was estimated
from simulated survey data and the Besan\c{c}on stellar population model, and
compared with the actual success rate of the survey. We find that expected and
actual success rates agree well, indicating that the numbers of solar twins and
analogues we discover in SDST are consistent with expectations, affirming the
survey approach. These distant solar analogues are prime targets for testing
for any variation in the strength of electromagnetism in regions of higher dark

propagation for semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (VOS). Based on
vision transformers, the recently-developed Associating Objects with
Transformers (AOT) approach introduces hierarchical propagation into VOS and
has shown promising results. The hierarchical propagation can gradually
propagate information from past frames to the current frame and transfer the
current frame feature from object-agnostic to object-specific. However, the
increase of object-specific information will inevitably lead to the loss of
object-agnostic visual information in deep propagation layers. To solve such a
problem and further facilitate the learning of visual embeddings, this paper
proposes a Decoupling Features in Hierarchical Propagation (DeAOT) approach.
Firstly, DeAOT decouples the hierarchical propagation of object-agnostic and
object-specific embeddings by handling them in two independent branches.
Secondly, to compensate for the additional computation from dual-branch
propagation, we propose an efficient module for constructing hierarchical
propagation, i.e., Gated Propagation Module, which is carefully designed with
single-head attention. Extensive experiments show that DeAOT significantly
outperforms AOT in both accuracy and efficiency. On YouTube-VOS, DeAOT can
achieve 86.0% at 22.4fps and 82.0% at 53.4fps. Without test-time augmentations,
we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, i.e.,

new measurement called the \textit{probability of localized level sets}

with a global threshold. On the theoretical side, we show that with a properly
chosen number of nearest neighbors $k_D$ in the bagged $k$-distance, the
sub-sample size $s$, the bagging rounds $B$, and the number of nearest
neighbors $k_L$ for the localized level sets, BDMBC can achieve optimal
convergence rates for mode estimation. It turns out that with a relatively
small $B$, the sub-sample size $s$ can be much smaller than the number of
training data $n$ at each bagging round, and the number of nearest neighbors
$k_D$ can be reduced simultaneously. Moreover, we establish optimal convergence
results for the level set estimation of the PLLS in terms of Hausdorff
distance, which reveals that BDMBC can find localized level sets for varying
densities and thus enjoys local adaptivity. On the practical side, we conduct

query and document, and then convert the retrieval problem into a nearest
neighbor search problem in the embedding space. Some previous works have mainly
focused on representing the web page with a single embedding, but in real web
search scenarios, it is difficult to represent all the information of a long
and complex structured web page as a single embedding. To address this issue,
we design a click feedback-aware web page summarization for
multi-embedding-based retrieval (CPS-MEBR) framework which is able to generate
multiple embeddings for web pages to match different potential queries.
Specifically, we use the click data of users in search logs to train a summary
model to extract those sentences in web pages that are frequently clicked by
users, which are more likely to answer those potential queries. Meanwhile, we
introduce sentence-level semantic interaction to design a multi-embedding-based
retrieval (MEBR) model, which can generate multiple embeddings to deal with
different potential queries by using frequently clicked sentences in web pages.
Offline experiments show that it can perform high quality candidate retrieval
compared to single-embedding-based retrieval (SEBR) model.

limited in their ability to propagate and preserve long-term dependencies
between nodes, i.e., they suffer from the over-squashing phenomena. This
reduces their effectiveness, since predictive problems may require to capture
interactions at different, and possibly large, radii in order to be effectively

framework for stable and non-dissipative DGN design, conceived through the lens
of ordinary differential equations. We give theoretical proof that our method
is stable and non-dissipative, leading to two key results: long-range
information between nodes is preserved, and no gradient vanishing or explosion
occurs in training. We empirically validate the proposed approach on several
graph benchmarks, showing that A-DGN yields to improved performance and enables
to learn effectively even when dozens of layers are used.

This proposed approach (ICC), exploits the first five inception blocks and the

[Almeida $\&$ Martins, Phys. Rev. D 104 (2021) 043524] by considering the more
comprehensive case of a time-varying coarse-graining scale for the string
wiggles. The modeling of the evolution of the network therefore relies on three
main mechanisms: Hubble expansion, energy transfer mechanisms (e.g., the
production of loops and wiggles) and the choice of the scale at which wiggles
are coarse-grained. We analyse the role of each of them on the overall
behaviour of the network, and thus in the allowed scaling solutions. In
Minkowski space, we find that linear scaling, previously observed in numerical
simulations without expansion, is not possible with a changing averaging scale.
For expanding universes, we find that the three broad classes of scaling
solutions -- with the wiggliness disappearing, reaching scaling, or growing --
still exist but are differently impacted by the time evolution of the
coarse-graining scale. Nambu-Goto type solutions (without wiggles) are
unaffected, growing wiggliness solutions are trivially generalized, while for
solutions where wiggliness reaches scaling the expansion rate for which the
solution exists is decreased with respect to the one for a fixed
coarse-graining scale. Finally, we also show that the inclusion of a
time-varying coarse-graining scale allows, in principle, for additional scaling
solutions which, although mathematically valid, are not physical. Overall, our
mapping of the landscape of the allowed scaling solutions of the wiggly
Velocity-Dependent One Scale Model paves the way for the detailed testing of
the model, to be done by forthcoming high-resolution field theory and
Nambu-Goto simulations.

mammalian cells, but also reproduced in model membrane systems, a broad
consensus exists on their formation and stability. Lipid membranes must be
composed of at least two molecular components, each stabilizing low (generally
a phospholipid) and high curvatures. Strong anisotropy or enhanced conical
shape of the second amphiphile is crucial for the formation of nanotunnels.
Anisotropic driving forces generally favor nanotube protrusions from vesicles.
In the present work, we report the unique case of topologically-connected
nanotubes-vesicles obtained in the absence of directional forces, in
single-molecule membranes, composed of an anisotropic bolaform glucolipid,
above its melting temperature, Tm. Cryo-TEM and fluorescence confocal

single-phase region, between 60{\textdegree} and 90{\textdegree}C under diluted

distinct configurations, head-head and head-tail. These arrangements, seemingly
of comparable energy above the Tm, could explain the existence and stability of
the topologically-connected vesicles and nanotubes, which are generally not
observed for classical single-molecule phospholipid-based membranes above their

structural information of the data by aggregating the neighboring nodes using a

performance is crucial. Convolutions based on graph Laplacian have emerged as
the dominant choice with the symmetric normalization of the adjacency matrix
$A$, defined as $D^{-1/2}AD^{-1/2}$, being the most widely adopted one, where
$D$ is the degree matrix. However, some empirical studies show that row
normalization $D^{-1}A$ outperforms it in node classification. Despite the
widespread use of GNNs, there is no rigorous theoretical study on the

behavior. In this work, we analyze the influence of the graph convolutions
theoretically using Graph Neural Tangent Kernel in a semi-supervised node

prove that: (i) row normalization preserves the underlying class structure
better than other convolutions; (ii) performance degrades with network depth

sensors since flip-chip bonding is not required. In addition, they allow for
significant reductions of the material budget of detector systems, due to the
smaller physical thicknesses of the active sensor and the absence of a separate
readout chip. The TANGERINE project develops a sensor suitable for future Higgs

The sensors will have small collection electrodes (order of $\mu$m) to maximize
the signal-to-noise ratio, which makes it possible to minimize power
dissipation in the circuitry. The first batch of test chips, featuring full

Different than the conventional cap-and-trade carbon trading mechanism, the
proposed CMO manages carbon allowance trading in a centralized jurisdictional

by solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of all three operational

to generate a synthetic dataset for instance segmentation in four steps. In
contrast to existing work, our pipeline covers every step from data acquisition
to the final dataset. We first scrape images for the objects of interest from
popular image search engines and since we rely only on text-based queries the
resulting data comprises a wide variety of images. Hence, image selection is
necessary as a second step. This approach of image scraping and selection
relaxes the need for a real-world domain-specific dataset that must be either
publicly available or created for this purpose. We employ an object-agnostic
background removal model and compare three different methods for image
selection: Object-agnostic pre-processing, manual image selection and CNN-based
image selection. In the third step, we generate random arrangements of the
object of interest and distractors on arbitrary backgrounds. Finally, the
composition of the images is done by pasting the objects using four different
blending methods. We present a case study for our dataset generation approach
by considering parcel segmentation. For the evaluation we created a dataset of
parcel photos that were annotated automatically. We find that (1) our dataset
generation pipeline allows a successful transfer to real test images (Mask AP
86.2), (2) a very accurate image selection process - in contrast to human
intuition - is not crucial and a broader category definition can help to bridge
the domain gap, (3) the usage of blending methods is beneficial compared to
simple copy-and-paste. We made our full code for scraping, image composition

Personalized spontaneous speech synthesis aims to reproduce the individuality

filled pauses. However, inserting the filled pauses degrades the quality of the
linguistic parts of the synthesized speech. This might be because filled-pause
insertion tendencies differ between training and inference, and the synthesis
model cannot represent connections between filled pauses and surrounding
phonemes in inference. We, therefore, developed a linguistic-speech consistency

  This article exhibits low differentially uniform power permutations over
finite fields of odd characteristic. Specifically, its objective is twofold
concerning the power functions $F(x)=x^{\frac{p^n+3}{2}}$ defined over the
finite field $F_{p^n}$ of order $p^n$, where $p$ is an odd prime, and $n$ is a
positive integer. The first is to complement some former results initiated by
Helleseth and Sandberg in \cite{HS} by solving the open problem left open for
more than twenty years concerning the determination of the differential
spectrum of $F$ when $p^n\equiv3\pmod 4$ and $p\neq 3$. The second is to
determine the exact value of its differential uniformity. Our achievements are
obtained firstly by evaluating some exponential sums over $F_{p^n}$ (which
amounts to evaluating the number of $F_{p^n}$-rational points on some related

Trapping-detrapping processes closed to the graphene/substrate interface are
the dominant sources of resistance fluctuations in the graphene channel, while
Coulomb fluctuations arising due to any remote charge fluctuations inside the
bulk of the substrate are effectively screened by the heavily doped substrate.
Here, we present electronic transport and low frequency noise characteristics
of large area CVD graphene field effect transistor (FET) prepared on a lightly
doped Si/SiO$_2$ substrate (N$_A$ $\sim$ 10$^{15}$cm$^{-3}$). Through a
systematic characterization of transport, noise and capacitance at various
temperature, we reveal that remote Si/SiO$_2$ interface can affect the charge
transport in graphene severely and any charge fluctuations inside bulk of the
silicon substrate can be sensed by the graphene channel. The resistance (R) vs.
back gate voltage (V$_{bg}$) characteristics of the device shows a hump around
the depletion region formed at the SiO$_2$/Si interface, confirmed by the
capacitance (C) - Voltage (V) measurement. Low frequency noise measurement on
these fabricated devices shows a peak in the noise amplitude close to the
depletion region. This indicates that due to the absence of any charge layer at
Si/SiO$_2$ interface, screening ability decreases and as a consequence, any
fluctuations in the deep level coulomb impurities inside the silicon substrate
can be observed as a noise in resistance in graphene channel via mobility
fluctuations. Noise behavior on ionic liquid gated graphene on the same

flares to drive effective acceleration leading to high energy electrons.
Unresolved mass motions are frequently detected in flares from extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) observations, which are often regarded as turbulence.
However, how this plasma turbulence forms during the flare is still largely a
mystery. Here we successfully reproduce observed turbulence in our 3D
magnetohydrodynamic simulation where the magnetic reconnection process is
included. The turbulence forms as a result of an intricate non-linear
interaction between the reconnection outflows and the magnetic arcades below
the reconnection site, in which the shear-flow driven Kelvin-Helmholtz
Instability (KHI) plays a key role for generating turbulent vortices. The
turbulence is produced above high density flare loops, and then propagates to
chromospheric footpoints along the magnetic field as Alfvenic perturbations.
High turbulent velocities above 200 km s^-1 can be found around the termination
shock, while the low atmosphere reaches turbulent velocities of 10 km s^-1 at a
layer where the number density is about 10^11 cm^-3. The turbulent region with
maximum non-thermal velocity coincides with the region where the observed
high-energy electrons are concentrated, demonstrating the potential role of
turbulence in acceleration. Synthetic views in EUV and fitted Hinode-EIS
spectra show excellent agreement with observational results. An energy analysis
demonstrates that more than 10% of the reconnection downflow kinetic energy can
be converted to turbulent energy via KHI.

the elements of a data structure in sequence. However, modern programming
systems such as Rust, Java, and C# generalise iteration far beyond the
traditional use case. They allow iterators to be parameterised with
(potentially side-effectful) closures and support the composition of iterators
to form iterator chains, where each iterator in the chain consumes values from
its predecessor and produces values for its successor. Such generalisations
pose three major challenges for modular specification and verification of
iterators and the client code using them: (1) How can parameterised iterators
be specified modularly and their (accumulated) side effects reasoned about? (2)
How can the behaviour of an iterator chain be derived from the specifications
of its component iterators? (3) How can proofs about such iterators be
automated?
  We present the first methodology for the modular specification and
verification of advanced iteration idioms with side-effectful computations. It
addresses the three challenges above using a combination of inductive two-state

find that the distributions of disk masses and radii are statistically
indistinguishable with those of the Class I/flat-spectrum objects in the Orion

Based on a mmWave HSR communication system with multiple mobile relays (MRs) on

characteristics of high-speed trains and considers three phases of train
movement: the train enters the cell, all MRs are covered in the cell, and the
train leaves the cell. The transmit power is further refined according to the
number of MRs in the cell and the distance between the train and the remote
radio head. By minimizing energy consumption under the constraints of the
transmitted data and transmit power budget, the transmit power is allocated to
multiple MRs through the multiplier punitive function-based algorithm.
Comprehensive simulation results, where the velocity estimation error is taken

first-order momentum $(1 - \alpha p)^{-4} d^3x d^3p$, where $\alpha$ is the
still-unestablished GUP parameter. In this study, we explore the mass-radius
relations of LGUP-modified white dwarfs, and provide them with radial
perturbations to investigate the dynamical instability arising from the
oscillations. We find from the mass-radius relations that LGUP results to a
white dwarf with a lower maximum mass, and this effect gets more apparent with
larger the values of $\alpha$. We also observe that the mass of the white dwarf
corresponding to the vanishing of the square of the fundamental frequency
$\omega_0$ is the maximum mass the white dwarf can have in the mass-radius
relations. The dynamical instability analysis also shows that instability sets
in for all values of the GUP parameters $\alpha$, and at lower central
densities $\rho_c$ (corresponding to lower maximum masses) for increasing
$\alpha$, which verifies the results obtained from the mass-radius relations
plots. Finally, we note that the mass limit is preserved for LGUP-modified
white dwarfs, indicating that LGUP supports gravitational collapse of the
compact object.

delegate his quantum computational task to a powerful server and still keep his
input, output, and algorithm private. There are mainly two kinds of models
about BQC, namely circuit-based and measurement-based models. In addition, a
hybrid model called ancilla-driven universal blind quantum computing (ADBQC)
was proposed by combining the properties of both circuit-based and
measurement-based models, where all unitary operations on the register qubits
can be realized with the aid of single ancillae coupled to the register qubits.
However, in the ADBQC model, the quantum capability of the client is strictly
limited to preparing single qubits. If a client can only perform single-qubit
measurements or a few simple quantum gates, he may also want to delegate his
computation to a remote server via ADBQC. This paper solves the problem and
extends the existing model by proposing two types of ADBQC protocols for
clients with different quantum capabilities, such as performing single-qubit
measurements or single-qubit gates. Furthermore, in the proposed two ADBQC
protocols, clients can detect whether servers are honest or not with a high
probability by using corresponding verifiable techniques.

high-dimensional pixel space into two dimensions. We show that the resulting 2D

achieve natural over-the-air model aggregation without requiring transmitter
side channel state information (CSI) for the uplink phase of FL, while
significantly reducing the channel estimation overhead at the receiver. We
extend this principle to the downlink communication phase and develop a simple
but highly effective model broadcast method for FL. We also relax the massive
MIMO assumption by proposing an enhanced random orthogonalization design for
both uplink and downlink FL communications, that does not rely on channel
hardening or favorable propagation. Theoretical analyses with respect to both

an explicit relationship among the convergence rate, the number of clients, and

about how to compute causality quantitatively. To address this challenge,
proxy-based negative control approaches have been commonly adopted, where

lack intuitive empirical interpretation and solid verification techniques,

principle (GUP) on white dwarfs has been given much attention in the
literature. However, these studies assume a zero temperature equation of state
(EoS), consequently excluding young white dwarfs whose initial temperatures are
substantially high. To that cause, this paper calculates the Chandrasekhar EoS
and resulting mass-radius relations of finite temperature white dwarfs modified
by the quadratic GUP, an approach that extends Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle by a quadratic term in momenta. The EoS was first approximated by
treating the quadratic GUP parameter as perturbative, causing the EoS to
exhibit expected thermal deviations at low pressures, and conflicting behaviors
at high pressures, depending on the order of approximation. We then proceeded
with a full numerical simulation of the modified EoS, and showed that in
general, finite temperatures cause the EoS at low pressures to soften, while
the quadratic GUP stiffens the EoS at high pressures. This modified EoS was
then applied to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations and its classical
approximation to obtain the modified mass-radius relations for general
relativistic and Newtonian white dwarfs. The relations for both cases were
found to exhibit the expected thermal deviations at small masses, where
low-mass white dwarfs are shifted to the high-mass regime at large radii, while
high-mass white dwarfs acquire larger masses, beyond the Chandrasekhar limit.
Additionally, we find that for sufficiently large values of the GUP parameter
and temperature, we obtain mass-radius relations that are completely removed
from the ideal case, as high-mass deviations due to GUP and low-mass deviations
due to temperature are no longer mutually exclusive.

significant ($>3\sigma$) CO emission from 4 objects. For our sample of 7
galaxies, we measure (or constrain with upper limits) their CO line fluxes and
estimate molecular gas masses ($M_{gas}$). We also estimate their stellar
masses ($M_{star}$) and SFRs by modelling their spectral energy distributions
(SEDs). Using these physical properties, we derive the gas-depletion timescales
($t_{dep} = M_{gas}/SFR$) and compare them with the bulge/BH growth timescales
($t_{grow} = M_{star}/SFR \sim M_{BH}/BHAR$). Our sample generally has
$t_{dep}$ shorter than $t_{grow}$ by a median factor of $\gtrsim 4$, indicating
that the cold gas will be depleted before significant bulge/BH growth takes
place. This result suggests that the BH-bulge lockstep growth is mainly
responsible for maintaining their mass relation, not creating it. We note that
our sample is small and limited to $z<2.5$; JWST and ALMA will be able to probe

Hagedorn temperature $T_H$. In the literature, one can find some intuitions
about its generalization to curved spacetimes, where computations are extremely
hard and explicit results cannot be provided in general. In this paper, we
present a genus-zero estimate of $T_H$, at leading order in $\alpha'$, for
string theories on curved backgrounds holographically dual to confining gauge
theories. This is a particularly interesting case, since the holographic
correspondence equates $T_H$ with the Hagedorn temperature of the dual gauge
theories. For concreteness we focus on Type IIA string theory on a well known
background dual to an $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory. The resulting Hagedorn
temperature turns out to be proportional to the square root of the Yang-Mills
confining string tension. The related coefficient, which at leading order is
analytically determined, is the same as the one for Type II theories in flat

which could be a result of having deeper convection zones. Apart from that,
spot properties show no significant trends with rotation period, infrared

be decided in linear time on graphs of bounded treewidth. Unfortunately, the
hidden constant implied by this theorem is a tower of exponentials whose height
increases with each quantifier alternation in the formula. More devastatingly,
this cannot be improved, under standard assumptions, even if we consider the
much more restricted problem of deciding FO-expressible properties on trees.
  In this paper we revisit this well-studied topic and identify a natural
special case where the dependence of Courcelle's theorem can, in fact, be
improved. Specifically, we show that all FO-expressible properties can be
decided with an elementary dependence on the input formula, if the input graph
has bounded pathwidth (rather than treewidth). This is a rare example of
treewidth and pathwidth having different complexity behaviors. Our result is
also in sharp contrast with MSO logic on graphs of bounded pathwidth, where it
is known that the dependence has to be non-elementary, under standard
assumptions. Our work builds upon, and generalizes, a corresponding
meta-theorem by Gajarsk{\'{y}} and Hlin{\v{e}}n{\'{y}} for the more restricted

imaging devices may lead to a change in perspective or time gap between shots,
making significant non-rigid spatial relationship in infrared and visible
images. Even if a large number of feature points are matched, the registration
accuracy may still be inadequate, affecting the result of image fusion and
other vision tasks. To alleviate this problem, we propose a Semantic-Aware
on-Demand registration network (SA-DNet), which mainly purpose is to confine
the feature matching process to the semantic region of interest (sROI) by
designing semantic-aware module (SAM) and HOL-Deep hybrid matching module
(HDM). After utilizing TPS to transform infrared and visible images based on
the corresponding feature points in sROI, the registered images are fused using
image fusion module (IFM) to achieve a fully functional registration and fusion
network. Moreover, we point out that for different demands, this type of
approach allows us to select semantic objects for feature matching as needed
and accomplishes task-specific registration based on specific requirements. To
demonstrate the robustness of SA-DNet for non-rigid distortions, we conduct
extensive experiments by comparing SA-DNet with five state-of-the-art infrared

that our method adapts better to the presence of non-rigid distortions in the
images and provides semantically well-registered images.

learning. In each round, the learner chooses a decision in a convex set and an
adversary chooses a convex loss function, and then the learner suffers the loss
associated with their current decision. However, in many applications the
learner's loss depends not only on the current decision but on the entire
history of decisions until that point. The OCO framework and its existing
generalizations do not capture this, and they can only be applied to many
settings of interest after a long series of approximation arguments. They also
leave open the question of whether the dependence on memory is tight because
there are no non-trivial lower bounds. In this work we introduce a
generalization of the OCO framework, ``Online Convex Optimization with
Unbounded Memory'', that captures long-term dependence on past decisions. We
introduce the notion of $p$-effective memory capacity, $H_p$, that quantifies
the maximum influence of past decisions on present losses. We prove an
$O(\sqrt{H_p T})$ upper bound on the policy regret and a matching (worst-case)
lower bound. As a special case, we prove the first non-trivial lower bound for
OCO with finite memory~\citep{anavaHM2015online}, which could be of independent
interest, and also improve existing upper bounds. We demonstrate the broad
applicability of our framework by using it to derive regret bounds, and to
improve and simplify existing regret bound derivations, for a variety of online
learning problems including online linear control and an online variant of
performative prediction.

the vast richness of data available today, in terms of both the quantity and
the rich content contained within. For example, biometric data such as images
and voices could reveal people's attributes like age, gender, sentiment, and
origin, whereas location/motion data could be used to infer people's activity
levels, transportation modes, and life habits. Along with the new services and
applications enabled by such technological advances, various governmental
policies are put in place to regulate such data usage and protect people's
privacy and rights. As a result, data owners often opt for simple data
obfuscation (e.g., blur people's faces in images) or withholding data
altogether, which leads to severe data quality degradation and greatly limits
the data's potential utility.
  Aiming for a sophisticated mechanism which gives data owners fine-grained
control while retaining the maximal degree of data utility, we propose
Multi-attribute Selective Suppression, or MaSS, a general framework for
performing precisely targeted data surgery to simultaneously suppress any
selected set of attributes while preserving the rest for downstream machine
learning tasks. MaSS learns a data modifier through adversarial games between
two sets of networks, where one is aimed at suppressing selected attributes,
and the other ensures the retention of the rest of the attributes via general
contrastive loss as well as explicit classification metrics. We carried out an
extensive evaluation of our proposed method using multiple datasets from
different domains including facial images, voice audio, and video clips, and
obtained promising results in MaSS' generalizability and capability of
suppressing targeted attributes without negatively affecting the data's
usability in other downstream ML tasks.

radiation. While pulsars generally slow down as they lose energy, some also
experience glitches: spontaneous increases of their rotational frequency.
According to several models, these glitches can also lead to the emission of
long-duration transient gravitational waves (GWs). We present detection
prospects for such signals by comparing indirect energy upper limits on GW
strain for known glitches with the sensitivity of current and future
ground-based GW detectors. We first consider the optimistic case of generic
constraints based on the glitch size and find that realistic matched-filter
searches in the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run(O4) could make a
detection, or set constraints below these indirect upper limits, for
equivalents of 36 out of 726 previously observed glitches, and 74 in the O5
run. With the third-generation Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer, 35-40% of
glitches would be accessible. When specialising to a scenario where transient
mountains produce the post-glitch GW emission, following the Yim & Jones model,
the indirect upper limits are stricter. Out of the smaller set of 119 glitches
with measured healing parameter, as needed for predictions under that model,
only 6 glitches would have been within reach for O4 and 14 for O5, with a
similar percentage as before with third generation detectors. We also discuss
how this model matches the observed glitch population.

Upon infection, an individual performs the transition pathway S to C to I to R

times, respectively. The waiting times for each compartment are independent and
drawn from specific probability density functions (PDFs) introducing memory

successfully used to make robots adapt to damages in seconds by leveraging a
diverse set of learned skills. A high diversity of skills increases the chances
of a robot to succeed at overcoming new situations since there are more
potential alternatives to solve a new task.However, finding and storing a large
behavioural diversity of multiple skills often leads to an increase in
computational complexity. Furthermore, robot planning in a large skill space is
an additional challenge that arises with an increased number of skills.
Hierarchical structures can help reducing this search and storage complexity by
breaking down skills into primitive skills. In this paper, we introduce the
Hierarchical Trial and Error algorithm, which uses a hierarchical behavioural
repertoire to learn diverse skills and leverages them to make the robot adapt
quickly in the physical world. We show that the hierarchical decomposition of
skills enables the robot to learn more complex behaviours while keeping the
learning of the repertoire tractable. Experiments with a hexapod robot show
that our method solves a maze navigation tasks with 20% less actions in
simulation, and 43% less actions in the physical world, for the most
challenging scenarios than the best baselines while having 78% less complete

frequency (RF) environment to implement communication with battery-free
devices. One critical challenge of AmBC systems is signal recovery because the
transmitted information bits are embedded in the ambient RF signals and these
are unknown and uncontrollable. To address this problem, most existing
approaches use averaging-based energy detectors and consequently the data rate
is low and there is an error floor. Here we propose a new detection strategy
based on the ratio between signals received from a multiple-antenna Reader. The
advantage of using the ratio is that ambient RF signals are removed directly
from the embedded signals without averaging and hence it can increase data
rates and avoid the error floor. Different from original ratio detectors that
use the magnitude ratio of the signals between two Reader antennas, in our
proposed approach, we utilize the complex ratio so that phase information is
preserved and propose an accurate linear channel model approximation. This
allows the application of existing linear detection techniques from which we
can obtain a minimum distance detector and closed-form expressions for bit
error rate (BER). In addition, averaging, coding and interleaving can also be
included to further enhance the BER. The results are also general, allowing any
number of Reader antennas to be utilized in the approach. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better than approaches based on
energy detection and original ratio detectors.

Meta-learning is a popular approach for few-shot learning. Previous work in
meta-learning typically assumes that the model architecture during
meta-training is the same as the model architecture used for final deployment.
In this paper, we challenge this basic assumption. For final deployment, we
often need the model to be small. But small models usually do not have enough
capacity to effectively adapt to new tasks. In the mean time, we often have
access to the large dataset and extensive computing power during meta-training
since meta-training is typically performed on a server. In this paper, we
propose task-specific meta distillation that simultaneously learns two models
in meta-learning: a large teacher model and a small student model. These two
models are jointly learned during meta-training. Given a new task during
meta-testing, the teacher model is first adapted to this task, then the adapted
teacher model is used to guide the adaptation of the student model. The adapted
student model is used for final deployment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in few-shot image classification using model-agnostic

similar semantic representations. Based on this consideration, we propose a
novel framework to learn the geometric primitives shared in seen and unseen
categories' objects, where the learned geometric primitives are served for
transferring knowledge from seen to unseen categories. Specifically, a group of
learnable prototypes automatically encode geometric primitives via
back-propagation. Then, the point visual representation is formulated as the
similarity vector of its feature to the prototypes, which implies semantic cues
for both seen and unseen categories. Besides, considering a 3D object composed
of multiple geometric primitives, we formulate the semantic representation as a
mixture-distributed embedding for the fine-grained match of visual
representation. In the end, to effectively learn the geometric primitives and
alleviate the misclassification issue, we propose a novel unknown-aware infoNCE
loss to align the visual and semantic representation. As a result, guided by
semantic representations, the network recognizes the novel object represented

improving cross-lingual transferability. Experimental results on mBERT and

  annular gaps using linear independent rotor whirling motions",,,"10.1016/j.ymssp.2022.109936",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Nowadays, most studies on the dynamic properties of annular gaps focus only
on the force characteristics due to translational motions, while the tilt and
moment coefficients are less well studied. Therefore, there is hardly any
reliable experimental data for the additional coefficients that can be used for
validation purpose. To improve this, a test rig first presented by Kuhr (2022)
is used to experimentally determine the dynamic force and moment
characteristics of three annuli of different lengths. By using active magnetic
bearings, the rotor is excited with user-defined frequencies and the rotor
position and the forces and moments induced by the flow field in the annulus
are measured. To obtain accurate and reliable experimental data, extensive
preliminary studies are carried out to determine the known characteristics of
the test rig rotor and the added mass and inertia imposed by the test rig.
Subsequently, an elaborate uncertainty quantification is carried out to
quantify the measurement uncertainties. The experimental results, i.e. the 48
rotordynamic coefficients, are compared to a new calculation method. It is
shown that the presented experimental data agree well with the calculation
method, especially for the additional rotordynamic tilt and moment
coefficients. Furthermore, it is shown that the annulus length significantly
influences the coefficients of the first sub-matrix. A dependence of the
additional coefficients on the length is recognisable, but less pronounced.
Even for the shortest investigated annulus, i.e. L = 1, the stiffness
coefficients due to the forces from the angular motion of the rotor are of the
same order of magnitude as the stiffness coefficients due to the forces from
the translational motion. This supports recent results, indicating that the
additional coefficients become relevant much earlier than assumed throughout
the literature, cf. Childs (1993).

end-to-end encryption for billions of users. They rely on a centralized,
application-specific server to distribute public keys and relay encrypted
messages between the users. Therefore, they prevent passive attacks but are
vulnerable to some active attacks. A malicious or hacked server can distribute
fake keys to users to perform man-in-the-middle or impersonation attacks. While
typical secure messaging applications provide a manual method for users to
detect these attacks, this burdens users, and studies show it is ineffective in
practice. This paper presents KTACA, a completely automated approach for key
verification that is oblivious to users and easy to deploy. We motivate KTACA
by designing two approaches to automatic key verification. One approach uses
client auditing (KTCA) and the second uses anonymous key monitoring (AKM). Both
have relatively inferior security properties, leading to KTACA, which combines
these approaches to provide the best of both worlds. We provide a security
analysis of each defense, identifying which attacks they can automatically
detect. We implement the active attacks to demonstrate they are possible, and
we also create a prototype implementation of all the defenses to measure their
performance and confirm their feasibility. Finally, we discuss the strengths
and weaknesses of each defense, the overhead on clients and service providers,
and deployment considerations.

explored. Vanadium in silicon carbide is such a system, with technological
interest for its optical emission at a telecom wavelength and compatibility

of microseconds. We demonstrate operation points where strong coupling to
neighbouring nuclear spins does not compromise the coherence of the central

run a large-scale analysis of the impact of architectures and training
hyperparameters on several common fairness metrics and show that the implicit
convention of choosing high-accuracy architectures may be suboptimal for
fairness. Motivated by our findings, we run the first neural architecture
search for fairness, jointly with a search for hyperparameters. We output a
suite of models which Pareto-dominate all other competitive architectures in

well to other face recognition datasets with similar and distinct protected

hole (~ 10^{2-5} M_sun), both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic
(EM) radiation are emitted. Once the eccentric orbit's pericenter radius
approaches the tidal radius, the WD would be tidally stripped upon each
pericenter passage. The accretion of these stripped mass would produce EM
radiation. It is suspected that the recently discovered new types of
transients, namely the quasi-periodic eruptions and the fast ultraluminous
X-ray bursts, might originate from such systems. Modeling these flares requires
a prediction of the amount of stripped mass from the WD and the details of the
mass supply to the accretion disk. We run hydrodynamical simulations to study
the orbital parameter dependence of the stripped mass. We find that our results
match the analytical estimate that the stripped mass is proportional to
z^{5/2}, where z is the excess depth by which the WD overfills its
instantaneous Roche lobe at the pericenter. The corresponding fallback rate of
the stripped mass is calculated, which may be useful in interpreting the
individual flaring light curve in candidate EM sources. We further calculate
the long-term mass-loss evolution of a WD during its inspiral and the
detectability of the GW and EM signals. The EM signal from the mass-loss stage
can be easily detected: the limiting distance is ~ 320(M_h/10^4 M_sun) Mpc for
Einstein Probe. The GW signal, for the space-borne detectors such as Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna or TianQin, can be detected only within the Local

Observatory Telescope (NEXT) at the Xingming Observatory. Through the analysis
of Wilson-Devinney (W-D) program, KN Per was found as an A-type low mass ratio
deep contact binary (q=0.236, f=53.4\%). A cool spot applied on the primary
component was introduced to explain the unequal maxima of the light curve.
Based on the O-C analysis, we found that the rate of the increasing orbital
period is $\dot{P}$ = 5.12 $\pm$ (0.30) $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ d/yr, meaning the
mass transfer from the secondary component to the primary one. By analyzing the
spectroscopic data, we detected chromospheric activity emission line
indicators, which is corresponding to the light-curve analysis. 71 long period
(P $>$ 0.5 days) contact binaries including our target were collected. The
evolutionary states of all collected stars were investigated by the
illustrations of mass-radius, mass-luminosity, and log M$_{T}$ - log J$_{o}$.
The relations of some physical parameters were also determined. With the
instability parameters of KN Per, we determined that it is a stable contact
binary system at present.

things in society has been widely studied in sociology and across the social
sciences, with investigations sufficiently diverse and dispersed to make them

but also the fundamental paradox underlying innovation science: When innovation
becomes predictable, it ceases to be an engine of novelty and change. Here we
review innovation studies and show that innovations emerge from contexts of
discord and disorder, breaches in the structure of prior success, through a
process we term destructive creation. This often leads to a complementary
process of creative destruction whereby local structures protect and channel
the diffusion of successful innovations, rendering alternatives obsolete. We
find that social scientists naturally focus far more on how social and cultural
contexts influence material innovations than the converse. We highlight
computational tools that open new possibilities for the analysis of novel
content and context in interaction, and show how this brings us empirically
toward the broader range of possibilities that complex systems and science

more explainable by investigating the cluster descriptors. Given a set of
objects $S$, a clustering of these objects $\pi$, and a set of tags $T$ that
have not participated in the clustering algorithm. Each object in $S$ is
associated with a subset of $T$. The goal is to find a representative set of

We propose a novel explainability model that reinforces the previous models in
such a way that tags that do not contribute to explainability and do not
sufficiently distinguish between clusters are not added to the optimal
descriptors. The proposed model is formulated as a quadratic unconstrained
binary optimization problem which makes it suitable for solving on modern
optimization hardware accelerators. We experimentally demonstrate how a
proposed explainability model can be solved on specialized hardware for

system is used without any countermeasure methods. In this paper, we are the
first in the literature to introduce master vein attacks in which we craft a
vein-looking image so that it can falsely match with as many identities as
possible by the FVR systems. We present two methods for generating master veins
for use in attacking these systems. The first uses an adaptation of the latent
variable evolution algorithm with a proposed generative model (a multi-stage
combination of beta-VAE and WGAN-GP models). The second uses an adversarial
machine learning attack method to attack a strong surrogate CNN-based
recognition system. The two methods can be easily combined to boost their
attack ability. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods
alone and together achieved false acceptance rates up to 73.29% and 88.79%,
respectively, against Miura's hand-crafted FVR system. We also point out that
Miura's system is easily compromised by non-vein-looking samples generated by a
WGAN-GP model with false acceptance rates up to 94.21%. The results raise the
alarm about the robustness of such systems and suggest that master vein attacks

sparse Bayesian learning (NSBL) algorithm to identify and estimate the complex
aerodynamics of limit cycle oscillations. NSBL provides a semi-analytical
framework for determining the data-optimal sparse model nested within a
(potentially) over-parameterized model. This is particularly relevant to
nonlinear dynamical systems where modelling approaches involve the use of
physics-based and data-driven components. In such cases, the data-driven
components, where analytical descriptions of the physical processes are not
readily available, are often prone to overfitting, meaning that the empirical
aspects of these models will often involve the calibration of an unnecessarily
large number of parameters. While it may be possible to fit the data well, this
can become an issue when using these models for predictions in regimes that are
different from those where the data was recorded. In view of this, it is
desirable to not only calibrate the model parameters, but also to identify the
optimal compromise between data-fit and model complexity. In this paper, this
is achieved for an aeroelastic system where the structural dynamics are
well-known and described by a differential equation model, coupled with a
semi-empirical aerodynamic model for laminar separation flutter resulting in
low-amplitude limit cycle oscillations. For the purpose of illustrating the
benefit of the algorithm, in this paper, we use synthetic data to demonstrate
the ability of the algorithm to correctly identify the optimal model and model
parameters, given a known data-generating model. The synthetic data are
generated from a forward simulation of a known differential equation model with
parameters selected so as to mimic the dynamics observed in wind-tunnel

additive manufacturing. Orthotropic microstructures locally oriented in

postulated and exemplified that isotropic microstructures (infill) may enhance
structural buckling stability but this has yet to be directly proven and
optimized. In this work, we optimize buckling stability of multiscale

dependent Willam-Warnke yield surfaces based on local buckling estimates from
Bloch-Floquet-based cell analysis to predict local instability of the
homogenized materials. These local buckling-based stress constraints are
combined with a global buckling criterion to obtain topology optimized designs

deflection of the mirror causes a change of the beam spot position, the
principal task is to measure the position on the image chip surface. We have
employed a numerical analysis of the Gaussian intensity pattern which uses the
nonlinear regression algorithm. The feasibility and performance of the method
were tested by numeric modeling as well as experimentally. The experimental
results indicate that the assembled instrument achieves a measurement error of
0.13 microradian in the range +-0.65 degrees over the period of one hour. This
corresponds to the dynamic range of 1:170 000.

studied the modified $f(Q)$ gravity with quadratic form $f(Q)=\alpha
Q^{2}+\beta$, where $Q$ is called as a non-metricity scalar and $\alpha $,
$\beta$ are positive constants. We obtain the modified Einstein field equation
by considering the viscosity coefficient $\xi(t)=\xi_{0}H$ and obtained the
scale factor $a(t)=2~sinh\left (\frac{m+ 2}
{6}\sqrt{\frac{\xi_{0}}{\alpha(2m+1)}}t\right)$.We applied the observational
constraint on the apparent magnitude $m(z)$ using the $\chi^{2}$ test formula
with observational data set like JLA or Union 2.1 compilation and obtained the
best approximate values of the model parameters ${ m,\alpha, H_{0} \xi_{0}}$.
We have analyzed our model and found a transit phase quintessence anisotropic
accelerating universe. We also examined the bulk viscosity equation of state
(EoS) parameter $\omega_{v}$ and obtained its current value as
$\omega_{v}<-1/3$, which shows the dark energy dominant model, cosmological
constant, phantom, and super-phantom dark energy models, and tends to the
$\Lambda$CDM value ($\omega_{v}=-1$) in the late time. We also estimate the
current age of the universe as $t_{0}\approx13.6$ Grys and analyze the
Statefinder parameters with $(s,r)\to(0,1)$ as $t \to \infty$.

disruptive innovation and high scalability. They are commonly regarded as
powerful engines for economic and social development. Meanwhile, startups are
heavily constrained by many factors such as limited financial funding and human
resources. Therefore the chance for a startup to eventually succeed is as rare
as ``spotting a unicorn in the wild''. Venture Capital (VC) strives to identify
and invest in unicorn startups during their early stages, hoping to gain a high
return. To avoid entirely relying on human domain expertise and intuition,
investors usually employ data-driven approaches to forecast the success
probability of startups. Over the past two decades, the industry has gone
through a paradigm shift moving from conventional statistical approaches
towards becoming machine-learning (ML) based. Notably, the rapid growth of data
volume and variety is quickly ushering in deep learning (DL), a subset of ML,
as a potentially superior approach in terms capacity and expressivity. In this
work, we carry out a literature review and synthesis on DL-based approaches,
covering the entire DL life cycle. The objective is a) to obtain a thorough and
in-depth understanding of the methodologies for startup evaluation using DL,
and b) to distil valuable and actionable learning for practitioners. To the
best of our knowledge, our work is the first of this kind.

quantum mechanics has recently been confirmed by numerically solving a number
of problems related to the interaction of a wave packet with potential
structures moving with acceleration. If these ideas are true, they can be fully
attributed to the case of neutron scattering on the atomic nuclei of
accelerating matter. Since the time of neutron interaction with the nucleus is
very short, the observation of the acceleration effect during scattering by
nuclei requires them to move with a very high acceleration. This goal can be
achieved if centripetal acceleration is used.

both the questions' difficulties and students' attempts at questions. Actually,
questions with the same knowledge concepts have different difficulties, and
students' different attempts also represent different knowledge mastery. In
this paper, we propose a difficulty and attempts boosted graph-based KT

method is designed to establish the question similarity relationship inspired
by the F1 score. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed DAGKT.

cutting off segments on the plane when moving and rotating the beginning of the
coordinate axes of space. This method is obtained by synthesis of two methods
of cutting off segments on the plane -- Cohen-Sutherland algorithm and
FC-algorithm. In the proposed method, the problem of triangle-triangle
intersection in 3D space is reduced to a simpler and less resource-intensive
cut-off problem on the plane. The main feature of the method is the developed
scheme of coding the points of the cut-off in relation to the triangle segment
plane. This scheme allows you to get rid of a large number of costly
calculations. In the article the cases of intersection of triangles at
parallelism, intersection and coincidence of planes of triangles are
considered. The proposed method can be used in solving the problem of
tetrahedron intersection, using the finite element method, as well as in image
processing.

greater correlation, and finally, get 6 elements, and then use the entropy
method (TEM) to find the dispersion of these elements in different countries.
Then use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the
dispersion, and then use the scandalized index to obtain the global equity.
Secondly, we simulated a future with asteroid mining and evaluated its impact
on Unified Equity Index (UEI). Then, we divided the mineable asteroids into
three classes with different mining difficulties and values, identified 28
mining entities including private companies, national and international
organizations. We considered changes in the asteroid classes, mining
capabilities and mining scales to determine the changes in the value of
minerals mined between 2025 and 2085. We convert mining output value into
mineral transaction value through allocation matrix. Based on grey relational
analysis (GRA). Finally, we presented three possible versions of the future of
asteroid mining by changing the conditions. We propose two sets of
corresponding policies for changes in future trends in global fairness with
asteroid mining. We test the separate and combined effects of these policies
