saturation problem that exists in the trajectory tracking process of unmanned
underwater vehicles (UUV). The control strategy consists of two parts: for the
kinematic modeling part, a fuzzy logic-refined backstepping control is
developed to achieve control velocities within acceptable ranges and errors of
small fluctuations; on the basis of the velocities deducted by the improved
kinematic control, the sliding mode control (SMC) is introduced in the dynamic
modeling to obtain corresponding torques and forces that should be applied to
the vehicle body. With the control velocities computed by the kinematic model
and applied forces derived by the dynamic model, the robustness and accuracy of
the UUV trajectory without actuator saturation can be achieved.

annotation is an intensive human labor problem, particularly in sequential
datasets, where the start and end time of anomalies are not known. As a result,
data collected from sequential real-world processes can be largely unlabeled or
contain inaccurate labels. These characteristics challenge the application of
anomaly detection techniques based on supervised learning. In contrast,
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been shown effective on problems with
incomplete knowledge of labels in the training dataset, mainly due to the
notion of bags. While largely under-leveraged for anomaly detection, MIL
provides an appealing formulation for anomaly detection over real-world
datasets, and it is the primary contribution of this paper. In this paper, we
propose an MIL-based formulation and various algorithmic instantiations of this
framework based on different design decisions for key components of the
framework. We evaluate the resulting algorithms over four datasets that capture
different physical processes along different modalities. The experimental
evaluation draws out several observations. The MIL-based formulation performs
no worse than single instance learning on easy to moderate datasets and
outperforms single-instance learning on more challenging datasets. Altogether,
the results show that the framework generalizes well over diverse datasets
resulting from different real-world application domains.

collaborative training of models without centralized access to the raw data on
local devices. In the typical FL paradigm (e.g., FedAvg), model weights are
sent to and from the server each round to participating clients. Recently, the
use of small pre-trained models has been shown effective in federated learning
optimization and improving convergence. However, recent state-of-the-art
pre-trained models are getting more capable but also have more parameters. In
conventional FL, sharing the enormous model weights can quickly put a massive
communication burden on the system, especially if more capable models are
employed. Can we find a solution to enable those strong and readily-available
pre-trained models in FL to achieve excellent performance while simultaneously
reducing the communication burden? To this end, we investigate the use of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning in federated learning and thus introduce a new
framework: FedPEFT. Specifically, we systemically evaluate the performance of
FedPEFT across a variety of client stability, data distribution, and
differential privacy settings. By only locally tuning and globally sharing a
small portion of the model weights, significant reductions in the total
communication overhead can be achieved while maintaining competitive or even
better performance in a wide range of federated learning scenarios, providing
insight into a new paradigm for practical and effective federated systems.

quasi-absorbing, and mixed strategy states and the transition nature,
continuous or discontinuous, between the states as the parameters of the system

the limit of zero effective temperature of the Fermi function, we find that the
copying probabilities are discontinuous functions of the system's parameters

final state for any system size, in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo

We explore the required conditions, in terms of mixing processes or mass loss,
for our models to reproduce the observed surface abundances of Sc in Am stars.
The models are computed with the Toulouse-Geneva evolution code, which uses the
parametric single-valued parameter method for the calculation of radiative
accelerations. Fingering mixing is included, using a prescription that comes
from 3D hydrodynamical simulations. Other parameter-dependent turbulent mixing
processes are also considered. A global mass loss is also implemented. When no

the models whose superficial layers are fully mixed down to the iron
accumulation zone, although other mixing prescriptions are also able to
reproduce the observations for the most massive model presented here ($2.0

gravitational wave detection/denoising in the 2D representation of

point out that a bi-linear form has been constructed previously to allow a
perturbation analysis of the spectrum, which was applied to study the
quasinormal modes of weakly charged Kerr-Newman black holes [Phys. Rev. D 91,

instability against potential terms that have infinitesimal ``energy"" norm that
is specifically defined by the type of inner products introduced by Jaramillo

necessary to address the stability of all previous mode analysis results to
reveal their susceptibility to energetically infinitesimal perturbations. In
particular, for near extremal Kerr spacetime, we show that the spectrum of
zero-damping modes, which have slow decay rates, is unstable (with order unity
fractional change in decay rates) with fine-tuned modification of the
potential. The decay rates are, however, always positive with energetically
infinitesimal perturbations. If finite potential modifications are allowed near
the black hole, it is possible to find superradiantly unstable modes, i.e., a
``black hole bomb"" without an explicit outer shell. For the zero-damping modes
in near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m-de Sitter black holes, which are

systems can be biased against certain subgroups of people. This has motivated a
growing number of bias mitigation algorithms that aim to address fairness
issues in machine learning. However, it is difficult to compare their
effectiveness in medical imaging for two reasons. First, there is little
consensus on the criteria to assess fairness. Second, existing bias mitigation
algorithms are developed under different settings, e.g., datasets, model
selection strategies, backbones, and fairness metrics, making a direct
comparison and evaluation based on existing results impossible. In this work,
we introduce MEDFAIR, a framework to benchmark the fairness of machine learning
models for medical imaging. MEDFAIR covers eleven algorithms from various
categories, nine datasets from different imaging modalities, and three model
selection criteria. Through extensive experiments, we find that the
under-studied issue of model selection criterion can have a significant impact
on fairness outcomes; while in contrast, state-of-the-art bias mitigation
algorithms do not significantly improve fairness outcomes over empirical risk
minimization (ERM) in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. We
evaluate fairness from various perspectives and make recommendations for
different medical application scenarios that require different ethical
principles. Our framework provides a reproducible and easy-to-use entry point
for the development and evaluation of future bias mitigation algorithms in deep
learning. Code is available at https://github.com/ys-zong/MEDFAIR.

diagnosis of complex systems. However, traditional CNN models rely on small
kernel filters to obtain local features from images. Thus, an excessively deep
CNN is required to capture global features, which are critical for fault
diagnosis of dynamical systems. In this work, we present an improved CNN that
embeds global features (GF-CNN). Our method uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
for dimension reduction to directly extract global features and integrate them
into the CNN. The advantage of this method is that both local and global
patterns in images can be captured by a simple model architecture instead of
establishing deep CNN models. The proposed method is applied to the fault
diagnosis of the Tennessee Eastman process. Simulation results show that the
GF-CNN can significantly improve the fault diagnosis performance compared to
traditional CNN. The proposed method can also be applied to other areas such as
computer vision and image processing.

internal kinematics of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in unprecedented
detail, providing insights on the non-axisymmetric structure of its disc. Aims:
To define and validate an improved selection strategy to distinguish the LMC
stars from the Milky Way foreground. To check the possible biases that assumed
parameters or sample contamination from the Milky Way can introduce in the
analysis of the internal kinematics of the LMC using Gaia data. Methods: Our
selection is based on a supervised Neural Network classifier using as much as
of the Gaia DR3 data as possible. We select three samples of candidate LMC
stars with different degrees of completeness and purity; we validate them using
different test samples and we compare them with the Gaia Collaboration paper
sample. We analyse the resulting velocity profiles and maps, and we check how
these results change when using also the line-of-sight velocities, available
for a subset of stars. Results: The contamination in the samples from Milky Way
stars affects basically the results for the outskirts of the LMC, and the
absence of line-of-sight velocities does not bias the results for the
kinematics in the inner disc. For the first time, we perform a kinematic
analysis of the LMC using samples with the full three dimensional velocity
information from Gaia DR3. Conclusions: The dynamics in the inner disc is
mainly bar dominated; the kinematics on the spiral arm over-density seem to be
dominated by an inward motion and a rotation faster than that of the disc in
the piece of the arm attached to the bar; contamination of MW stars seem to
dominate the outer parts of the disc and mainly affects old evolutionary
phases; uncertainties in the assumed disc morphological parameters and
line-of-sight velocity of the LMC can in some cases have significant effects.

Three different types of entropy measures namely Shannon's entropy, entropy
rates for Markov chains, and entropy production rate have been utilised. The
measures are evaluated on a large-scale in-home monitoring dataset that has
been collected within our dementia care clinical study. The study uses Internet
of Things (IoT) enabled solutions for continuous monitoring of in-home

solutions to support people living with dementia (PLWD) in their own homes. Our
main goal is to show the applicability of the entropy measures to time-series

features that can be fed into inference and analysis models. The results of our
experiments show that in most cases the combination of these measures can
indicate the occurrence of healthcare-related events. We also find that
different participants with the same events may have different measures based
on one entropy measure. So using a combination of these measures in an

goal of achieving favorable outcomes. In such settings, predictions don't
passively forecast the future; instead, predictions actively shape the
distribution of outcomes they are meant to predict. This performative
prediction setting raises new challenges for learning ""optimal"" decision rules.
In particular, existing solution concepts do not address the apparent tension
between the goals of forecasting outcomes accurately and steering individuals
to achieve desirable outcomes.
  To contend with this concern, we introduce a new optimality concept --
performative omniprediction -- adapted from the supervised (non-performative)
learning setting. A performative omnipredictor is a single predictor that
simultaneously encodes the optimal decision rule with respect to many
possibly-competing objectives. Our main result demonstrates that efficient
performative omnipredictors exist, under a natural restriction of performative
prediction, which we call outcome performativity. On a technical level, our
results follow by carefully generalizing the notion of outcome
indistinguishability to the outcome performative setting. From an appropriate
notion of Performative OI, we recover many consequences known to hold in the
supervised setting, such as omniprediction and universal adaptability.

separating the contributions from deformation, polar, and impurity scattering
mechanisms. We conclusively demonstrate that a temperature dependence of
$T^{-1.5}$ is not a reliable indicator of deformation potential scattering. Our

the core of autonomous vehicle (AV) planning modules. However, previous IL
works show sample inefficiency and low generalisation in safety-critical
scenarios, on which they are rarely tested. As a result, IL planners can reach
a performance plateau where adding more training data ceases to improve the
learnt policy. First, our work presents an IL model using the spline
coefficient parameterisation and offline expert queries to enhance safety and
training efficiency. Then, we expose the weakness of the learnt IL policy by
synthetically generating critical scenarios through optimisation of parameters
of the driver's risk field (DRF), a parametric human driving behaviour model
implemented in a multi-agent traffic simulator based on the Lyft Prediction
Dataset. To continuously improve the learnt policy, we retrain the IL model
with augmented data. Thanks to the expressivity and interpretability of the
DRF, the desired driving behaviours can be encoded and aggregated to the
original training data. Our work constitutes a full development cycle that can
efficiently and continuously improve the learnt IL policies in closed-loop.
Finally, we show that our IL planner developed with less training resource
still has superior performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art.

the most studied PUFs, out of an effort to improve the resistance against
machine learning attacks of probably the most lightweight delay-based PUFs -
the Arbiter PUFs. However, recent attack studies reveal that even XOR-PUFs with
large XOR sizes are still not safe against machine learning attacks. Increasing
PUF stages or components and using different challenges for different
components are two ways to improve the security of APUF-based PUFs, but more
stages or components lead to more hardware cost and higher operation power, and
different challenges for different components require the transmission of more
bits during operations, which also leads to higher power consumption. In this
paper, we present a strategy that combines the choice of XOR Arbiter PUF
(XOR-PUF) architecture parameters with the way XOR-PUFs are used to achieve
lightweights in hardware cost and energy consumption as well as security
against machine learning attacks. Experimental evaluations show that with the
proposed strategy, highly lightweight component-differentially challenged

this strategy a potential blueprint for the fabrication and use of XOR-PUFs for

enhanced with a decision-tree classification algorithm for more efficient

simulated stochastic signals that are not correlated with any known signal

at a larger distance than previous model-independent searches. The sensitivity
improvements are achieved across the broad spectrum of simulated signals, with
the goal of testing the robustness of this model-agnostic search. At a
false-alarm rate of one event per century, the detectable signal amplitudes are
reduced up to almost an order of magnitude, most notably for the single-cycle
signal morphologies. This ML-enhanced pipeline also improves the detection
efficiency of compact binary mergers in a wide range of masses, from stellar
mass to intermediate-mass black holes, both with circular and elliptical
orbits. After excluding previously detected compact binaries, no new
gravitational-wave signals are observed for the two-fold Hanford-Livingston and

at 148 d reveal that the spectrum is dominated by oxygen and magnesium emission
lines of different transitions and ionization states: O I, [O I], [O II], [O

though it bears a few features similar to those of some interacting type Ibn

Together with the nebular spectrum, this suggests that SN 2021ocs underwent
late-time interaction with an H/He-poor circumstellar medium (CSM), resulting
from the pre-SN progenitor mass loss during its final $\sim$1000 days. The
strong O and Mg lines and the absence of strong C and He lines suggest that the

extreme case of massive progenitor star's envelope stripping in interacting

formed due to gravitational instabilities, also known as Rayleigh-Taylor

mechanisms for the mass transfer of gaseous CO2 into brine with different
initial ionic concentrations and flow permeability. Moreover, the impact of CO2
flow rates, injection locations, reservoir dipping angle, and permeability
heterogeneity is also investigated. We observed that the presence of salts
resulted in earlier onset of convection and a larger convective finger
wavelength than the case with no dissolved salts. In addition, experimental
data showed a higher lateral mixing between CO2 fingers when dipping is
involved. The visual investigation also revealed that the CO2 dissolution rate,
measured by the rate of the convective fingers advance, depends on the type and
concentration of the ions present in the brine. The CO2 dissolution for
solutions with varying salt dissolved, indicated by the area of the
pH-depressed region, is observed to be 0.38-0.77 times compared to when no salt
is present. Although convective flow is slowed down in the presence of salts,
the diffusive flux is enhanced, as observed from both qualitative and
quantitative results. Moreover, the reduced formation permeability, introduced
by using a flow barrier, resulted in numerous regions not being swept by the
dissolved CO2, indicating an inefficient dissolution. We also investigated the
effect of discrete high conductivity fractures within the flow barriers, which
showed an uneven vertical sweep and enhanced flow channeling. Lastly, the
parameters regarding CO2 leakage risk during storage are identified and
discussed.

population-level decisions in health technology assessment. For non-collapsible
effect measures, purely prognostic variables that do not predict response to
treatment at the individual level may modify marginal treatment effects at the
population level. This has important implications for recommended practices for
evidence synthesis. Firstly, unadjusted indirect comparisons of marginal
effects may be biased in the absence of individual-level treatment effect
heterogeneity. Secondly, covariate adjustment may be necessary to account for
cross-study imbalances in purely prognostic variables. Popular summary measures
in meta-analysis such as odds ratios and hazard ratios are non-collapsible.
Collapsible measures would facilitate the transportability of marginal effects

facilitating the selection of baseline characteristics for covariate adjustment

horizon control (RHC) approach for multi-agent systems (MAS) with metric
temporal logic (MTL) specifications. In the MAS considered in this paper, each
agent privatizes its sensitive information from other agents using a
differential privacy mechanism. In other words, each agent adds privacy noise
(e.g., Gaussian noise) to its output to maintain its privacy and communicates
its noisy output with its neighboring agents. We define two types of MTL
specifications for the MAS: agent-level specifications and system-level
specifications. Agents should collaborate to satisfy the system-level MTL
specifications with a minimum probability while each agent must satisfy its own
agent-level MTL specifications at the same time. In the proposed distributed
RHC approach, each agent communicates with its neighboring agents to acquire
their noisy outputs and calculates an estimate of the system-level trajectory.
Then each agent synthesizes its own control inputs such that the system-level
specifications are satisfied with a minimum probability while the agent-level
specifications are also satisfied. In the proposed optimization formulation of
RHC, we directly incorporate Kalman filter equations to calculate the estimates
of the system-level trajectory, and we use mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) to encode the MTL specifications as optimization constraints. Finally,
we implement the proposed distributed RHC approach in a case study.

evolution as a function of disorder. By exact diagonalization of finite size
systems we show that the evolution of properties of a typical wave-function is
non-monotonic. That is, disorder leads to states delocalizing, until a certain
crossover disorder strength is attained, after which they start to localize.
Although this non-monotonic behavior is only present in finite-size systems and
vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, the crossover disorder strength decreases
logarithmically slowly with system size, and is quite large even for very large
approximants. The non-monotonic evolution of spatial properties of eigenstates
can be observed in the anomalous dimensions of the wave-function amplitudes, in
their multifractal spectra, and in their dynamical properties. We compute the
two-point correlation functions of wave-function amplitudes and show that these
follow power laws in distance and energy, consistent with the idea that
wave-functions retain their multifractal structure on a scale which depends on
disorder strength. Dynamical properties are studied as a function of disorder.
We find that the diffusion exponents do not reflect the non-monotonic
wave-function evolution. Instead, they are essentially independent of disorder
until disorder increases beyond the crossover value, after which they decrease
rapidly, until the strong localization regime is reached. The differences
between our results and earlier studies on geometrically disordered
``phason-flip'' models lead us to propose that the two models are in different
universality classes. We conclude by discussing some implications of our
results for transport and a proposal for a Mott hopping mechanism between power
law localized wave-functions, in moderately disordered quasicrystals.

causal effects in observational studies. Researchers can typically focus on
either the average treatment effect or the average treatment effect on the
treated with inverse probability weighting estimators. However, when overlap
between the treated and control groups is poor, this can produce extreme
weights that can result in biased estimates and large variances. One
alternative to inverse probability weights are overlap weights, which target
the population with the most overlap on observed characteristics. While
estimates based on overlap weights produce less bias in such contexts, the
causal estimand can be difficult to interpret. One alternative to inverse
probability weights are balancing weights, which directly target imbalances
during the estimation process. Here, we explore whether balancing weights allow
analysts to target the average treatment effect on the treated in cases where
inverse probability weights are biased due to poor overlap. We conduct three
simulation studies and an empirical application. We find that in many cases,
balancing weights allow the analyst to still target the average treatment
effect on the treated even when overlap is poor. We show that while overlap
weights remain a key tool for estimating causal effects, more familiar
estimands can be targeted by using balancing weights instead of inverse
probability weights.

Transformer-based Molecular model called Transformer-M, which can take
molecular data of 2D or 3D formats as input and generate meaningful semantic
representations. Using the standard Transformer as the backbone architecture,
Transformer-M develops two separated channels to encode 2D and 3D structural
information and incorporate them with the atom features in the network modules.
When the input data is in a particular format, the corresponding channel will
be activated, and the other will be disabled. By training on 2D and 3D
molecular data with properly designed supervised signals, Transformer-M
automatically learns to leverage knowledge from different data modalities and
correctly capture the representations. We conducted extensive experiments for
Transformer-M. All empirical results show that Transformer-M can simultaneously
achieve strong performance on 2D and 3D tasks, suggesting its broad

process, extending across all frontiers. In the last decade, advances in
detector technology, analysis techniques and theoretical modeling have enabled
a new generation of experiments and searches while broadening the types of
candidates we can pursue. Over the next decade, there is great potential for
discoveries that would transform our understanding of dark matter. In the
following, we outline a road map for discovery developed in collaboration among
the frontiers. A strong portfolio of experiments that delves deep, searches
wide, and harnesses the complementarity between techniques is key to tackling
this complicated problem, requiring expertise, results, and planning from all
Frontiers of the Snowmass 2021 process.

present AnoML which is an end-to-end data science pipeline that allows the
integration of multiple wireless communication protocols, anomaly detection
algorithms, deployment to the edge, fog, and cloud platforms with minimal user
interaction. We facilitate the development of IoT anomaly detection mechanisms
by reducing the barriers that are formed due to the heterogeneity of an IoT
environment. The proposed pipeline supports four main phases: (i) data
ingestion, (ii) model training, (iii) model deployment, (iv) inference and

comparing the efficiency of several machine learning algorithms within
different nodes. We also provide the source code

the beginning of time than previously. Here we report the discovery of 12
galaxy candidates observed 300-600 Myr after the Big Bang with photometric
redshifts between z ~ 8.5-13 measured using JWST NIRCam imaging of the galaxy
cluster WHL0137 observed in 8 filters spanning 0.8-5.0 $\mu$m, plus 9 HST
filters spanning 0.4-1.7 $\mu$m. Three of these candidates are gravitationally
lensed by the foreground galaxy cluster and have magnifications of $\mu \sim 3
- 8$. The remaining nine candidates are located in a second JWST NIRCam module,
centered ~29' from the cluster center, with expected magnifications of $\mu$ <~
1.1. Our sample of high-redshift candidates have observed F200W AB magnitudes
between 25.9 and 28.1 mag and intrinsic F200W AB magnitudes between 26.4 and
29.7 mag ($M_{UV}$ = -22.5 to -17). We find the stellar masses of these
galaxies are in the range $\log M_{*}/M_{\odot}$ = 8 - 9, and down to 7.5 for
the lensed galaxies. All are young with mass-weighted ages < 100 Myr, low dust
content $A_V$ < 0.15 mag, and high specific star formation rates sSFR ~10-50
Gyr$^{-1}$ for most. One z ~ 9 candidate is consistent with an age < 5 Myr and
a sSFR ~250 Gyr$^{-1}$, as inferred from a strong F444W excess, implying
[OIII]+H-beta rest-frame equivalent width ~2000 Angstrom, although an older and
redder z~ 10 object is also allowed. Another z~9 candidate ID9356 is lensed
into an arc 2.6"" long by the effects of strong gravitational lensing ($\mu$~8),
and has at least two bright knots of unevenly distributed star formation. This
arc is the most spatially-resolved galaxy at z~9 known to date, revealing
structures ~30 pc across. Follow-up spectroscopy of WHL0137 with JWST/NIRSpec
is planned for later this year, which will validate some of these candidates
and study their physical properties in more detail.

observations is vital to enable collision avoidance in applications such as VR,
AR, and wearable assistive robotics. In this work, we introduce the challenging
problem of predicting collisions in diverse environments from multi-view
egocentric videos captured from body-mounted cameras. Solving this problem
requires a generalizable perception system that can classify which human body
joints will collide and estimate a collision region heatmap to localize
collisions in the environment. To achieve this, we propose a transformer-based
model called COPILOT to perform collision prediction and localization
simultaneously, which accumulates information across multi-view inputs through
a novel 4D space-time-viewpoint attention mechanism. To train our model and
enable future research on this task, we develop a synthetic data generation
framework that produces egocentric videos of virtual humans moving and
colliding within diverse 3D environments. This framework is then used to
establish a large-scale dataset consisting of 8.6M egocentric RGBD frames.
Extensive experiments show that COPILOT generalizes to unseen synthetic as well
as real-world scenes. We further demonstrate COPILOT outputs are useful for
downstream collision avoidance through simple closed-loop control. Please visit

mid-infrared nulling interferometer space mission to detect planets within the

concept of habitability and present yield estimates for two stellar samples
consisting of nearby (d<20 pc) Sun-like stars (4800-6300 K) and nearby FGK-type
stars (3940-7220 K) accessible to such a mission. Our yield estimates are based
on recently derived occurrence rates of rocky planets from the Kepler mission
and our LIFE exoplanet observation simulation tool LIFEsim, which includes all
main astrophysical noise sources, but no instrumental noise sources as yet.
Depending on a pessimistic or optimistic extrapolation of the Kepler results,
we find that during a 2.5-year search phase, LIFE could detect between ~10-16
(average) or ~5-34 (including 1$\sigma$ uncertainties) rocky planets (0.5-1.5
R${}_\rm{Earth}$) within the optimistic HZ of Sun-like stars and between ~4-6

the larger sample of FGK-type stars, the yield increases to ~16-22 (average)
rocky planets within the optimistic HZ and ~5-8 (average) EECs. Furthermore, we
find that in addition to the mirror diameter, the yield depends strongly on the
total throughput, but only weakly on the exozodiacal dust level and the
accessible wavelength range of the mission. When the focus lies entirely on
Sun-like stars, larger mirrors (~3 m with 5% total throughput) or a better

relevant sample of ~30 rocky planets within the optimistic HZ.

training of deep learning models, recent work in the image and NLP domains
showed that training updates leak private data of participating clients. At the
same time, most high-stakes applications of FL (e.g., legal and financial) use
tabular data. Compared to the NLP and image domains, reconstruction of tabular
data poses several unique challenges: (i) categorical features introduce a
significantly more difficult mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem,
(ii) the mix of categorical and continuous features causes high variance in the
final reconstructions, and (iii) structured data makes it difficult for the
adversary to judge reconstruction quality. In this work, we tackle these
challenges and propose the first comprehensive reconstruction attack on tabular
data, called TabLeak. TabLeak is based on three key ingredients: (i) a softmax
structural prior, implicitly converting the mixed discrete-continuous
optimization problem into an easier fully continuous one, (ii) a way to reduce
the variance of our reconstructions through a pooled ensembling scheme
exploiting the structure of tabular data, and (iii) an entropy measure which
can successfully assess reconstruction quality. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates the effectiveness of TabLeak, reaching a state-of-the-art on four
popular tabular datasets. For instance, on the Adult dataset, we improve attack
accuracy by 10% compared to the baseline on the practically relevant batch size
of 32 and further obtain non-trivial reconstructions for batch sizes as large
as 128. Our findings are important as they show that performing FL on tabular
data, which often poses high privacy risks, is highly vulnerable.

the relevant progress for the important $\ell_\infty$ perturbation setting is
rather limited, and a principled understanding of how to design expressive
$\ell_\infty$ Lipschitz networks is still lacking. In this paper, we bridge the
gap by studying certified $\ell_\infty$ robustness from a novel perspective of
representing Boolean functions. We derive two fundamental impossibility results
that hold for any standard Lipschitz network: one for robust classification on
finite datasets, and the other for Lipschitz function approximation. These
results identify that networks built upon norm-bounded affine layers and
Lipschitz activations intrinsically lose expressive power even in the
two-dimensional case, and shed light on how recently proposed Lipschitz
networks (e.g., GroupSort and $\ell_\infty$-distance nets) bypass these
impossibilities by leveraging order statistic functions. Finally, based on
these insights, we develop a unified Lipschitz network that generalizes prior
works, and design a practical version that can be efficiently trained (making
certified robust training free). Extensive experiments show that our approach
is scalable, efficient, and consistently yields better certified robustness
across multiple datasets and perturbation radii than prior Lipschitz networks.

involves data preparation followed by cleansing or scrubbing through
context-dependent attribute correction, which ensures that there is no
significant loss of relevant information before the feature selection and
prediction phases. An ensemble of heterogeneous classifiers, subjected to local

extracts the user's pulse wave by analyzing subtle color variations across the
skin regions of the user's face. The user's pulse wave is then used to
determine stress (according to the Baevsky Stress Index), heart rate, and heart
rate variability. We evaluate our technology on the UBFC dataset, the MMSE-HR
dataset, and Beam AI's internal data. Our technology achieves 99.2%, 97.8% and
98.5% accuracy for heart rate estimation on each benchmark respectively, a
nearly twice lower error rate than competing methods. We further demonstrate an
average Pearson correlation of 0.801 in determining stress and heart rate
variability, thus producing commercially useful readings to derive content
decisions in apps. Our SDK is available for use at www.beamhealth.ai.

the classifiers built from the data streams. In this paper, we present a vector
quantization-based sampling method, which substantially reduces the class

parallel processing, batch processing, and randomly selecting samples. We show
that the accuracy of classification models improves when the data streams are

of fit. For high dimensional environments such nested-loop structure entails a
significant computational burden. To reduce the computational burden of a
nested loop, novel methods such as SQIL [1] and IQ-Learn [2] emphasize policy

are unique signposts of supermassive black hole activity in the early universe.
However, bright radio sources at $z\ge5$ are extremely rare and therefore we
have started a campaign to search for new high-$z$ quasars by combining an
optical dropout selection driven by the $g$, $r$, and $z$ bands from the Dark
Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys with
low-frequency radio observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS).
Currently, LoTSS covers a large fraction of the northern sky (5720 deg$^2$) to
such a depth (median noise level of 83 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$) that about 30% of
the general quasar population is detected $-$ which is a factor of 5-10 more
than previous large sky radio surveys such as NVSS and FIRST, respectively. In
this paper, we present the discovery of 20 new quasars (and the independent
confirmation of 4) between $4.9\leq z\leq 6.6$. Out of the 24 quasars, 21
satisfy the traditional radio-loudness criterion of
$R=f_{5\text{GHz}}/f_{4400A} > 10$, with the full sample spanning
$R\sim$6-1000, thereby more than doubling the sample of known radio-loud
quasars at $z \ge 5$. Our radio detection requirement strongly decreases the
contamination of stellar sources and allows one to select these quasars in a
broad redshift range. Despite selecting our quasar candidates using fewer and
less conservative colour restrictions, both the optical and near-infrared
colours, Ly$\alpha$ emission line properties, and dust reddening, $E(B-V)$,
measurements of our quasar sample do not deviate from the known radio-quiet
quasar population, suggesting similar optical quasar properties of the
radio-loud and radio-quiet quasar population at high-$z$. Our campaign
demonstrates the potential for discovering new high-$z$ quasar populations
through next generation radio continuum surveys.

potentially powerful solution to some long lasting challenges. This enthusiasm
is reflected in an unprecedented exponential growth of publications using
neural networks. Half a decade after the first published work in astronomy
mentioning deep learning, we believe it is timely to review what has been the
real impact of this new technology in the field and its potential to solve key
challenges raised by the size and complexity of the new datasets. In this
review we first aim at summarizing the main applications of deep learning for
galaxy surveys that have emerged so far. We then extract the major achievements
and lessons learned and highlight key open questions and limitations. Overall,
state-of-the art deep learning methods are rapidly adopted by the astronomical
community, reflecting a democratization of these methods. We show that the
majority of works using deep learning up to date are oriented to computer
vision tasks. This is also the domain of application where deep learning has
brought the most important breakthroughs so far. We report that the
applications are becoming more diverse and deep learning is used for estimating
galaxy properties, identifying outliers or constraining the cosmological model.
Most of these works remain at the exploratory level. Some common challenges
will most likely need to be addressed before moving to the next phase of
deployment of deep learning in the processing of future surveys; e.g.
uncertainty quantification, interpretability, data labeling and domain shift
issues from training with simulations, which constitutes a common practice in

explain the similar isotopic compositions of Earth and lunar rocks at the same

scenarios are hotly debated. Above a high resolution threshold for simulations,
we find that giant impacts can immediately place a satellite with similar mass
and iron content to the Moon into orbit far outside the Earth's Roche limit.
Even satellites that initially pass within the Roche limit can reliably and
predictably survive, by being partially stripped then torqued onto wider,
stable orbits. Furthermore, the outer layers of these directly formed
satellites are molten over cooler interiors and are composed of around 60%
proto-Earth material. This could alleviate the tension between the Moon's
Earth-like isotopic composition and the different signature expected for the
impactor. Immediate formation opens up new options for the Moon's early orbit
and evolution, including the possibility of a highly tilted orbit to explain
the lunar inclination, and offers a simpler, single-stage scenario for the
origin of the Moon.

deriving e-folding timescales of $\tau_\text{in} = 1.01 \pm 0.13$ Gyr for GSE

does not contain any age measurements. The differences in evolutionary
parameters between the two are qualitatively consistent with trends with
stellar mass $M_\star$ predicted by simulations and semi-analytic models of
galaxy formation. Our fitting method is based only on poisson sampling from an
evolutionary track and requires no binning of the data. We demonstrate its
accuracy by testing against mock data, showing that it accurately recovers the
input model across a broad range of sample sizes ($20 \leq N \leq 2000$) and

must explain simultaneously. A plausible driver of such diversity is
self-interactions between dark matter particles (SIDM) if the cross section
passes the threshold for the gravothermal collapse phase at the characteristic
velocities of the MW satellites. In this case, some of the satellites are
expected to be hosted by subhalos that are still in the classical SIDM core
phase, while those in the collapse phase would have cuspy inner profiles, with
a SIDM-driven intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) in the centre as a
consequence of the runaway collapse. We develop an analytical framework that
takes into account the cosmological assembly of halos and is calibrated to
previous simulations; we then predict the timescales and mass scales ($M_{\rm

stellar mass $\dot{N}_\text{Ia} / M_\star \sim M_\star^{-0.3}$ as measured in
ASAS-SN and DES strongly suggests that the number of SNe Ia produced by a
stellar population depends inversely on its metallicity. We estimate the
strength of the required metallicity dependence by combining the average star
formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass with
the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for galaxies and common parametrizations
for the SN Ia delay-time distribution. The differences in SFHs can account for
only $\sim$30% of the increase in the specific SN Ia rate between stellar
masses of $M_\star = 10^{10}$ and $10^{7.2} M_\odot$. We find that an
additional metallicity dependence of approximately $\sim$Z$^{-0.5}$ is required
to explain the observed scaling. This scaling matches the metallicity
dependence of the close binary fraction observed in APOGEE, suggesting that the
enhanced SN Ia rate in low-mass galaxies can be explained by a combination of
their more extended SFHs and a higher binary fraction due to their lower
metallicities. Due to the shape of the MZR, only galaxies below $M_\star
\approx 3\times10^9 M_\odot$ are significantly affected by the
metallicity-dependent SN Ia rates. The $\dot{N}_\text{Ia} / M_\star \sim
M_\star^{-0.3}$ scaling becomes shallower with increasing redshift, dropping by
factor of $\sim$2 at $10^{7.2} M_\odot$ between $z = 0$ and $1$ with our
$\sim$$Z^{-0.5}$ scaling. With metallicity-independent rates, this decrease is
a factor of $\sim$3. We discuss the implications of metallicity-dependent SN Ia
rates for one-zone models of galactic chemical evolution.

of the LFBOT candidate MUSSES2020J). Re-radiation by the dust before being
destroyed generates an near-infrared (NIR) ""echo"" of luminosity ~1e41-1e42
erg/s lasting weeks, which is detectable over the transient's rapidly fading
blue continuum. We show that this dust echo is compatible with the previously
unexplained NIR excess observed in AT2018cow. The gradual decay of the early
NIR light curve can result from CSM which is concentrated in wide-angle outflow
or torus, consistent with the highly aspherical geometry of AT2018cow's ejecta.
Pre-maximum optical/UV and NIR follow-up of LFBOTs provide an new probe of
their CSM environments and place additional constraints on their progenitors.

MObile convolution (i.e., inverted residual blocks) and ATtention. Unlike the
current works that stack separate mobile convolution and transformer blocks, we
effectively merge them into a MOAT block. Starting with a standard Transformer
block, we replace its multi-layer perceptron with a mobile convolution block,
and further reorder it before the self-attention operation. The mobile
convolution block not only enhances the network representation capacity, but
also produces better downsampled features. Our conceptually simple MOAT
networks are surprisingly effective, achieving 89.1% / 81.5% top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K / ImageNet-1K-V2 with ImageNet22K pretraining. Additionally, MOAT
can be seamlessly applied to downstream tasks that require large resolution
inputs by simply converting the global attention to window attention. Thanks to
the mobile convolution that effectively exchanges local information between
pixels (and thus cross-windows), MOAT does not need the extra window-shifting
mechanism. As a result, on COCO object detection, MOAT achieves 59.2% box AP
with 227M model parameters (single-scale inference, and hard NMS), and on
ADE20K semantic segmentation, MOAT attains 57.6% mIoU with 496M model
parameters (single-scale inference). Finally, the tiny-MOAT family, obtained by
simply reducing the channel sizes, also surprisingly outperforms several
mobile-specific transformer-based models on ImageNet. The tiny-MOAT family is
also benchmarked on downstream tasks, serving as a baseline for the community.
We hope our simple yet effective MOAT will inspire more seamless integration of
convolution and self-attention. Code is publicly available.

consider several possible origins of the intrinsic scatter with particular
attention to fluctuations in the relative enrichment by core-collapse

CCSN progenitor mass distribution. The stochastic sampling scenario provides a
good quantitative explanation of our data if the effective number of CCSN

median metallicity of our sample, this interpretation implies that the CCSN
ejecta are mixed over a gas mass $\sim 10^5 M_{\odot}$ before forming stars.
The scatter of elemental abundance ratios is a powerful diagnostic test for

whole-spectrum fitting to an observed spectrum. The auto-differentiable model
employs back-propagation, the fundamental algorithm empowering modern Deep

physically interpretable line profile properties such as amplitude, width,
location, and shape, plus radial velocity and rotational broadening. This
hybrid data-/model- driven framework allows joint modeling of stellar and
telluric lines simultaneously, a potentially transformative step forwards for
mitigating the deleterious telluric contamination in the near-infrared. The
blas\'e approach acts as both a deconvolution tool and semi-empirical model.
The general purpose scaffolding may be extensible to many scientific

two distinct mass scales lead to scalaron potentials that have a flattened
hilltop, or tabletop. Inflationary evolution in tabletop models agrees very
well with CMB observations. Tabletop potentials therefore provide a new and
compelling class of MOG-based inflationary models. By contrast, MOG models with
a single mass scale generally correspond to steep hilltop potentials and fail
to reproduce the CMB power spectrum. Inflationary evolution in hilltop/tabletop
models can proceed in two alternative directions: towards the stable point at
small $R$ describing the observable universe, or towards the asymptotic region
at large $R$. The MOG models which we examine have several new properties
including the fact that gravity can become asymptotically vanishing, with
$G_{\rm eff} \to 0$, at infinite or large finite values of the scalar curvature

large $R$ will either run into a 'Big-Rip' singularity, or inflate eternally.

Specifically, an adversary can perform backdoor attacks to control model
predictions via poisoning the training dataset with a trigger. In this work, we
propose a mitigation for backdoor attacks in a federated learning setup. Our
solution forces the model optimization trajectory to focus on the invariant
directions that are generally useful for utility and avoid selecting directions
that favor few and possibly malicious clients. Concretely, we consider the sign
consistency of the pseudo-gradient (the client update) as an estimation of the
invariance. Following this, our approach performs dimension-wise filtering to
remove pseudo-gradient elements with low sign consistency. Then, a robust mean
estimator eliminates outliers among the remaining dimensions. Our theoretical

enters deep within the tidal radius, such that the ratio of the tidal radius to
the pericenter distance $\beta$ satisfies $\beta \gg 1$, the star is tidally
compressed and heated. It was predicted that the maximum density and
temperature attained during deep TDEs scale as $\propto \beta^3$ and $\propto

but these predictions have been debated over the last four decades. We perform
Newtonian smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of deep TDEs

find that neither the maximum density nor temperature follow the $\propto

by $\sim$ an order of magnitude compared to past predictions. We also perform
simulations in the Schwarzschild metric, and find that relativistic effects
modestly increase the maximum density (by a factor of $\lesssim 1.5$) and
induce a time lag relative to the Newtonian simulations, which is induced by
time dilation. We also confirm that the time the star spends at high density
and temperature is a very small fraction of its dynamical time. We therefore
predict that the amount of nuclear burning achieved by radiative stars during

at a finite temperature in space dimension $d=2$ reveal that the expected
Lifshitz-Cahn-Allen scaling law $\sim t^{1/2}$ can be observed with no
early-time corrections, even for system sizes much smaller than what is
traditionally used. Up to a certain period, all the others species, i.e., the

interactions among particles confined to a doubly-periodic geometry with either
a single bottom wall or two walls (slit channel) in the aperiodic direction.
Our spectrally-accurate Stokes solver uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in
the periodic $xy$ plane and Chebyshev polynomials in the aperiodic $z$
direction normal to the wall(s). We decompose the problem into two problems.
The first is a doubly-periodic subproblem in the presence of particles (source
terms) with free-space boundary conditions in the $z$ direction, which we solve
by borrowing ideas from a recent method for rapid evaluation of electrostatic
interactions in doubly-periodic geometries [O. Maxian, R. P. Pel\'aez, L.
Greengard and A. Donev, J. Chem. Phys. 154, 204107 (2021)]. The second is a
correction subproblem to impose the boundary conditions on the wall(s). Instead
of the traditional Gaussian kernel, we use the exponential of a semicircle
kernel to model the source terms (body force) due to the presence of particles,
and provide optimum values for the kernel parameters that ensure a given
hydrodynamic radius with at least two digits of accuracy and rotational and
translational invariance. The computation time of our solver, which is
implemented in graphical processing units, scales linearly with the number of
particles, and allows computations with about a million particles in less than
a second for a sedimented layer of colloidal microrollers. We find that in a
slit channel, a driven dense suspension of microrollers maintains the same
two-layer structure as above a single wall, but moves at a substantially lower
collective speed due to increased confinement.

in two dimensions. The presence of a phase transition of the BKT universality
class is shown in an off-lattice model of particles with purely repulsive
interaction employing computer simulations. A critical spin wave region $0 < T
< T_{\textrm{BKT}}$ is found with a non-universal exponent $\eta(T)$ that
follows the shape suggested by BKT theory, including a critical value
consistent with $\eta_{\textrm{BKT}} = 1/4$. One can observe a transition from
power-law decay to exponential decay in the static correlation functions at the
transition temperature $T_{\textrm{BKT}}$, which is supported by finite-size
scaling analysis. A critical temperature $T_{\textrm{BKT}} = 0.17(1)$ is
suggested. Investigations into the dynamic aspects of the phase transition are
carried out. The short-time behavior of the incoherent spin autocorrelation
function agrees with the Nelson-Fisher prediction, whereas the long-time
behavior differs from the finite-size scaling known for the static XY model.
Analysis of coherent spin wave dynamics shows that the spin wave peak is a
propagating mode that can be reasonably well fitted by hydrodynamic theory. The
mobility of the particles strongly enhances damping of the spin waves, but the
model lies still within the dynamic universality class of the standard XY
model.

microfluidic devices, since it combines the versatility of conventional soft

Specifically, the wettability of NOA81 can be continuously tuned through
exposure to high-energy UV. Despite its growing popularity, the exact physical
and chemical mechanisms behind the wettability alteration have not been fully
characterized.
  Here, we apply different characterization techniques, including contact angle

microscopy (AFM) to investigate the impact of high-energy UV on the chemical
and physical properties of NOA81 surfaces. We find that high-energy UV exposure
increases the oxygen-containing polar functional groups, which enhances the
surface energy and hydrophilicity of NOA81. Additionally, our AFM measurements
show that spin-coated NOA81 surfaces have a roughness less than a nanometer,
which is further reduced after high-energy UV irradiation. Lastly, we advance

standard Brownian motion acquires a drift at an independent exponential random
time which is not directly observable. Based on the observation in continuous

quickly as possible after it has appeared. The optimiser can inspect the system
multiple times upon payment of a fixed cost per inspection. If a test is
performed on the system before the drift has appeared then, naturally, the test
will return a negative outcome. However, if a test is performed after the drift
has appeared, then the test may fail to detect it and return a false negative
with probability $\epsilon\in(0,1)$. The optimisation ends when the drift is
eventually detected. The problem is formulated mathematically as an optimal
multiple stopping problem and it is shown to be equivalent to a recursive
optimal stopping problem. Exploiting such connection and free boundary methods
we find explicit formulae for the expected cost and the optimal strategy. We

these methods are incapable of utilizing higher-order information about group

complexes extend the dyadic model of graphs and can model polyadic
relationships which are ubiquitous and crucial in many complex social and

walk on links of simplicial complexes defined by the higher-order Laplacian--a
generalization of the graph Laplacian that incorporates polyadic relationships
of the network. We transform this random walk into a graph-based random walk on
a lifted line graph--a dual graph in which links are nodes while nodes and
higher-order connections are links--and optimize for the standard notion of
modularity. We show that our method is guaranteed to provide interpretable link
partitioning results under mild assumptions. We also offer new theoretical
results on the spectral properties of simplicial complexes by studying the

Reporting those bugs on a repository such as GitHub is a standard route to fix
them. Yet, given the growing number of new GitHub reports for DL frameworks, it
is intrinsically difficult for developers to distinguish those that reveal
non-functional bugs among the others, and assign them to the right contributor
for investigation in a timely manner. In this paper, we propose MHNurf - an
end-to-end tool for automatically identifying non-functional bug related
reports in DL frameworks. The core of MHNurf is a Multifaceted Hierarchical
Attention Network (MHAN) that tackles three unaddressed challenges: (1)
learning the semantic knowledge, but doing so by (2) considering the hierarchy
(e.g., words/tokens in sentences/statements) and focusing on the important
parts (i.e., words, tokens, sentences, and statements) of a GitHub report,
while (3) independently extracting information from different types of
features, i.e., content, comment, code, command, and label.
  To evaluate MHNurf, we leverage 3,721 GitHub reports from five DL frameworks
for conducting experiments. The results show that MHNurf works the best with a
combination of content, comment, and code, which considerably outperforms the
classic HAN where only the content is used. MHNurf also produces significantly

Accordingly, we have conducted a comprehensive imaging survey of NGC 7027

reducing the number of similarity comparisons. Our randomized algorithm,
ProtoBandit, identifies a set of $k$ prototypes incurring $O(k|\mathcal{S}|)$
similarity comparisons, which is independent of the size of the target set. An
interesting outcome of our analysis is for the $k$-medoids clustering problem

medicines to children, increased attention has been given to extrapolation.
Loosely, it is the leveraging of conclusions or available data from adults or
older age groups to draw conclusions for the target pediatric population when
it can be assumed that the course of the disease and the expected response to a
medicinal product would be sufficiently similar in the pediatric and the
reference population. Extrapolation then can be characterized as a statistical
mapping of information from the reference (adults or older age groups) to the
target pediatric population. The translation, or loosely mapping of
information, can be through a composite likelihood approach where the
likelihood of the reference population is weighted by exponentiation and that
this exponent is related to the value of the mapped information in the target
population. The weight is bounded above and below recognizing the fact that
similarity (of the disease and the expected response) is still valid despite
variability of response between the cohorts. Maximum likelihood approaches are
then used for estimation of parameters and asymptotic theory is used to derive
distributions of estimates for use in inference. Hence, the estimation of
effects in the target population borrows information from reference population.

this acoustically efficient near-field source from large-eddy-simulation data
and use it to inform a predictive model. Our approach uses the resolvent
framework, in which the source takes the form of nonlinear fluctuation terms
that act as a forcing on the linearized Navier-Stokes equations. First, we
identify the forcing that, when acted on by the resolvent operator, produces
the leading spectral proper orthogonal decomposition modes in the acoustic
field for a Mach 0.4 jet. Second, the radiating components of this forcing are
isolated by retaining only portions with a supersonic phase speed. This
component makes up less than 0.05% of the total forcing energy but generates
most of the acoustic response, especially at peak (downstream) radiation
angles. Finally, we propose an empirical model for the identified acoustically

flight-stream conditions and predicts noise within 2 dB accuracy for a range of

Most methods use a holistic representation to jointly model the body and

applications like virtual try-on. Other methods separately model the body and
clothing, but they require training from a large set of 3D clothed human meshes
obtained from 3D/4D scanners or physics simulations. Our insight is that the
body and clothing have different modeling requirements. While the body is well
represented by a mesh-based parametric 3D model, implicit representations and
neural radiance fields are better suited to capturing the large variety in
shape and appearance present in clothing. Building on this insight, we propose
SCARF (Segmented Clothed Avatar Radiance Field), a hybrid model combining a
mesh-based body with a neural radiance field. Integrating the mesh into the
volumetric rendering in combination with a differentiable rasterizer enables us
to optimize SCARF directly from monocular videos, without any 3D supervision.
The hybrid modeling enables SCARF to (i) animate the clothed body avatar by
changing body poses (including hand articulation and facial expressions), (ii)
synthesize novel views of the avatar, and (iii) transfer clothing between
avatars in virtual try-on applications. We demonstrate that SCARF reconstructs
clothing with higher visual quality than existing methods, that the clothing
deforms with changing body pose and body shape, and that clothing can be
successfully transferred between avatars of different subjects. The code and

from a compact binary system travel near a massive object. The mismatch between
a lensed signal and unlensed templates determines whether lensing can be
identified in a particular GW event. For axisymmetric lens models, the lensed
signal is traditionally calculated in terms of model-dependent lens parameters
such as the lens mass $M_L$ and source position $y$. We propose that it is
useful to parameterize this signal instead in terms of model-independent image
parameters: the flux ratio $I$ and time delay $\Delta t_d$ between images. The
functional dependence of the lensed signal on these image parameters is far
simpler, facilitating data analysis for events with modest signal-to-noise
ratios. In the geometrical-optics approximation, constraints on $I$ and $\Delta
t_d$ can be inverted to constrain $M_L$ and $y$ for any lens model including
the point mass (PM) and singular isothermal sphere (SIS) that we consider. We
use our model-independent image parameters to determine the detectability of
gravitational lensing in GW signals and find that for GW events with
signal-to-noise ratios $\rho$ and total mass $M$, lensing should in principle
be identifiable for flux ratios $I \gtrsim 2\rho^{-2}$ and time delays $\Delta

pre-trained language models, one unresolved issue is that the generated
summaries are not always faithful to the input document. There are two possible
causes of the unfaithfulness problem: (1) the summarization model fails to
understand or capture the gist of the input text, and (2) the model over-relies
on the language model to generate fluent but inadequate words. In this work, we
propose a Faithfulness Enhanced Summarization model (FES), which is designed
for addressing these two problems and improving faithfulness in abstractive
summarization. For the first problem, we propose to use question-answering (QA)
to examine whether the encoder fully grasps the input document and can answer
the questions on the key information in the input. The QA attention on the
proper input words can also be used to stipulate how the decoder should attend
to the source. For the second problem, we introduce a max-margin loss defined
on the difference between the language and the summarization model, aiming to
prevent the overconfidence of the language model. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark summarization datasets, CNN/DM and XSum, demonstrate that our model
significantly outperforms strong baselines. The evaluation of factual
consistency also shows that our model generates more faithful summaries than
baselines.

necessitates an uncertainty-aware approach to meta-learning. In addition, the
often multimodal nature of task distributions can pose unique challenges to
meta-learning methods. In this work, we present UnLiMiTD (uncertainty-aware
meta-learning for multimodal task distributions), a novel method for
meta-learning that (1) makes probabilistic predictions on in-distribution tasks

configuration. Such a two-truck platooning problem is pervasive in practice yet
challenging to solve due to hard deadline constraints and enormous platooning
configurations to consider. We first leverage a unique problem structure to
significantly simplify platooning optimization and present a novel formulation.
We prove that the two-truck platooning problem is weakly NP-hard and admits a
Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS). The FPTAS can achieve a
fuel consumption within a ratio of $(1+\epsilon)$ to the optimal (for any
$\epsilon>0$) with a time complexity polynomial in the size of the
transportation network and $1/\epsilon$. These results are in sharp contrast to
the general multi-truck platooning problem, which is known to be APX-hard and
repels any FPTAS. As the FPTAS still incurs excessive running time for
large-scale cases, we design an efficient dual-subgradient algorithm for
solving large-/national- scale instances. It is an iterative algorithm that
always converges. We prove that each iteration only incurs polynomial-time
complexity, albeit it requires solving an integer linear programming problem
optimally. We characterize a condition under which the algorithm generates an

not met. Extensive simulations based on real-world traces show that our joint

substrate (1DAPS) modulated two-dimensional dusty plasma (2DDP) driven by an
unbiased sinusoidal excitation force are investigated using Langevin dynamical
simulations. It is discovered that, by changing the amplitude and frequency of
the unbiased sinusoidal external excitations, as well as the depth of 1DPAS,
both the direction and speed of the persistent particle flow can be adjusted,
i.e., both the flow rectification and its reversal of the ratchet effect of the
steady drift motion for particles are achieved using various excitations. For
the studied 2DDP under the 1DAPS, when the amplitude of the excitation
increases from zero, the magnitude of the overall drift velocity increases from
zero to its first maximum in the easy direction of the 1DAPS, next decreases
gradually back to zero, and then increases from zero to its second maximum in
the hard direction of 1DAPS before finally gradually decaying. It is found
that, as the frequency of the excitation and the depth of 1DAPS change, the
maximum overall drift velocity also varies, and the corresponding magnitude of
the excitation varies simultaneously. The observed ratchet effect in both the
easy and hard directions of 1DAPS for 2DDP is attributed to the combination of
the spatial symmetry breaking of 1DAPS and the inertial effects of particles,
which is further confirmed by the three different presented diagnostics.

scenarios to explain, within a single framework, the diverse set of coronal
observations available with the present instrument resolutions. The model is
based on the idea that the coronal structure is formed by elementary magnetic
strands which are tangled and twisted by the displacement of their photospheric
footpoints by convective motions. These displacements inject magnetic stress
between neighbor strands that promotes current sheet formation, reconnection,
plasma heating, and possibly also particle acceleration. Among other features,
the model predicts the ubiquitous presence of plasma flows at different
temperatures. These flows should, in principle, produce measurable effects on
observed spectral lines in the form of Doppler-shifts, line asymmetries and
non-thermal broadenings. In this work we use a Two-Dimensional Cellular
Automaton Model (2DCAM) developed in previous works, in combination with the
Enthalpy Based Thermal Evolution of Loops (EBTEL) model, to analyze the effect
of nanoflare heating on a set of known EUV spectral lines. We find that the
complex combination of the emission from plasmas at different temperatures,
densities and velocities, in simultaneously evolving unresolved strands,
produces characteristic properties in the constructed synthetic lines, such as
Doppler-shifts and non-thermal velocities up to tens of km s$^{-1}$ for the
higher analyzed temperatures. Our results might prove useful to guide future
modeling and observations, in particular, regarding the new generation of
proposed instruments designed to diagnose plasmas in the 5 to 10 MK temperature

$r$-boundary complexity of a DAG $G$, $b_{r}\left(G\right)$, is the minimum
integer $b$ such that there is an $r$-visit where, at each stage, for at most
$b$ of the vertices yet to be visited an enabling set has already been visited.
By a reformulation of known results, it is shown that the boundary complexity

2022, simultaneously with radio observations from MWA, MeerKAT and ATCA. Its
radio emission and 18-min periodicity led the source to be tentatively
interpreted as an extreme magnetar or a peculiar highly magnetic white dwarf.
The source was not detected in the 0.3-8 keV energy range with a 3-sigma
upper-limit on the count rate of 3x10^{-4} counts/s. No radio emission was
detected during our X-ray observations either. Furthermore, we studied the
field around GLEAM-X J1627 using archival ESO and DECam data, as well as recent
SALT observations. Many sources are present close to the position of GLEAM-X
J1627, but only two within the 2"" radio position uncertainty. Depending on the
assumed spectral distribution, the upper limits converted to an X-ray
luminosity of L_{X}<6.5x10^{29} erg/s for a blackbody with temperature kT=0.3
keV, or L_{X}<9x10^{29} erg/s for a power-law with photon index Gamma = 2
(assuming a 1.3 kpc distance). Furthermore, we performed magneto-thermal
simulations for neutron stars considering crust- and core-dominated field
configurations. Based on our multi-band limits, we conclude that: i) in the
magnetar scenario, the X-ray upper limits suggest that GLEAM-X J1627 should be
older than ~1 Myr, unless it has a core-dominated magnetic field or has
experienced fast-cooling; ii) in the white dwarf scenario, we can rule out most
binary systems, a hot sub-dwarf and a hot magnetic isolated white dwarf
(T>10.000 K), while a cold isolated white dwarf is still compatible with our
limits.

proposal with three different arguments. Firstly, polar encoding ensures that
missing values become equidistant from all non-missing values by mapping the
latter onto the unit circle. Secondly, polar encoding lets decision trees
choose how missing values should be split, providing a practical realisation of
the missingness incorporated in attributes (MIA) proposal. And lastly, polar
encoding corresponds to the normalised representation of categorical and
$[0,1]$-valued attributes when viewed as barycentric attributes, a new concept
based on traditional barycentric coordinates. In particular, we show that
barycentric attributes are fuzzified categorical attributes, that their
normalised representation generalises one-hot encoding, and that the polar
encoding of $[0, 1]$-valued attributes is analogous to the one-hot encoding of
binary attributes. With an experiment based on twenty real-life datasets with
missing values, we show that polar encoding performs about as well or better

transverse electric (TE) polarization), an excited TE mode provides spectral
tuning. The orthogonally propagating TM mode is robust in angle. Conversely, if
the POI is set for p-polarization, an ex-cited TM mode provides the tuning.
Detailed explanations of the underlying physical processes are set forth by
decomposing the 2D lattice into equivalent 1D gratings using second-order
effective-medium theory (EMT). This is shown to work extremely well even for a
strongly modulated lattice with refractive-index contrast of 3. With proper
design and corresponding experiments, a widely tunable notch filter covering
longwave infrared bands is demonstrated. Experimentally varying the incidence
angle up to 16 degree, a notch channel in TM polarization tunes across a band

a favorable candidate for describing the all of the dark matter content.
Towards the lower end of this mass range, the Hawking temperature, $T_{\rm H}$,
of these PBHs is $T_{\rm H} \gtrsim 100$ keV, allowing for the creation of
electron -- positron pairs; thus making their Hawking radiation a useful
constraint for most current and future MeV surveys. This motivates the need for
realistic and rigorous accounts of the distribution and dynamics of emitted
particles from Hawking radiation in order to properly model detected signals
from high energy observations. This is the first in a series of papers to
account for the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ correction to the Hawking radiation
spectrum. We begin by the usual canonical quantization of the photon and spinor
(electron/positron) fields on the Schwarzschild geometry. Then we compute the
correction to the rate of emission by standard time dependent perturbation
theory from the interaction Hamiltonian. We conclude with the analytic
expression for the dissipative correction, i.e. corrections due to the creation
and annihilation of electron/positrons in the plasma.

intensity patterns. The total reflected or transmitted intensity is summed in a
single-pixel detector from which the object is computationally reconstructed.
In the situation where the measurements are limited by photon-noise, it is
questionable whether a single-pixel camera performs better or worse than simply
scanning the object with a focused intensity spot - a modality known as
\textit{point raster scanning} and employed in many laser scanning systems.
Here, we solve this general question and report that positive intensity
modulation based on Hadamard or Cosine patterns does not necessarily improve
the single-to-noise ratio (SNR) of single-pixel cameras as compared to point
raster scanning, as compared to a raster-scanning. Instead, we show that the
SNR is only improved on object pixels at least k times brighter than the object
mean signal, where k is a constant that depends on the modulation scheme. This
fundamental property is demonstrated theoretically and numerically. It is also
experimentally confirmed in the spatial domain - for widefield fluorescence
imaging - and in the spectral domain - for spontaneous Raman spectral
measurements. Finally, we provide user-oriented guidelines that help decide
when and how multiplexing under photon-noise should be used instead of point
raster scanning.

this work, the distribution of RREA was simulated in GEANT4 was simulated

that accounting for the presence of hydrometeors cannot be simplified and
reduced to a change in the main substance. Two methods are considered -
modeling of volumetric hydrometeors as separate modeling objects and as a
simple change in the components of a whole substance (adding water to air with
a corresponding density). These methods show completely different results.
Modeling by volumes of hydrometeors shows a decrease in the length of the
avalanche by 20 %, on the other hand, when modeling with a modified material,
the length changed only by 1 %. This suddenly proves that hydrometeors should
be taken into account in research, as they can significantly change the growth

environment around an ego-vehicle evolves with time. Ego-centric perception of
driveable regions in a scene not only changes with the motion of actors in the
environment, but also with the movement of the ego-vehicle itself.
Self-supervised representations proposed for large-scale planning, such as
ego-centric freespace, confound these two motions, making the representation
difficult to use for downstream motion planners. In this paper, we use
geometric occupancy as a natural alternative to view-dependent representations
such as freespace. Occupancy maps naturally disentangle the motion of the
environment from the motion of the ego-vehicle. However, one cannot directly
observe the full 3D occupancy of a scene (due to occlusion), making it
difficult to use as a signal for learning. Our key insight is to use
differentiable raycasting to ""render"" future occupancy predictions into future
LiDAR sweep predictions, which can be compared with ground-truth sweeps for
self-supervised learning. The use of differentiable raycasting allows occupancy
to emerge as an internal representation within the forecasting network. In the
absence of groundtruth occupancy, we quantitatively evaluate the forecasting of
raycasted LiDAR sweeps and show improvements of upto 15 F1 points. For
downstream motion planners, where emergent occupancy can be directly used to
guide non-driveable regions, this representation relatively reduces the number
of collisions with objects by up to 17% as compared to freespace-centric motion
planners.

transition among a finite number of states. We are particularly motivated by
applications such as human activity analysis where the observed time-series
contains segments representing distinct activities such as running or walking
as well as segments characterized by continuous transition among these states.
Accordingly, the dynamical Wasserstein barycenter (DWB) model introduced in
Cheng et al. in 2021 [1] associates with each state, which we call a pure
state, its own probability distribution, and models these continuous
transitions with the dynamics of the barycentric weights that combine the pure
state distributions via the Wasserstein barycenter. Here, focusing on the
univariate case where Wasserstein distances and barycenters can be computed in
closed form, we extend [1] by discussing two challenges associated with
learning a DWB model and two improvements. First, we highlight the issue of
uniqueness in identifying the model parameters. Secondly, we discuss the
challenge of estimating a dynamically evolving distribution given a limited
number of samples. The uncertainty associated with this estimation may cause a
model's learned dynamics to not reflect the gradual transitions characteristic
of the system. The first improvement introduces a regularization framework that
addresses this uncertainty by imposing temporal smoothness on the dynamics of
the barycentric weights while leveraging the understanding of the
non-uniqueness of the problem. This is done without defining an entire
stochastic model for the dynamics of the system as in [1]. Our second
improvement lifts the Gaussian assumption on the pure states distributions in

estimation in a variational framework and propose a finite approximation to the

bias level for detector operation. In the case of weak light sources such as
novel lasers or single-photon emitters, the rate of counts due to the light
source can be comparable to that of the detector dark counts. In such cases, a
characterization of the statistical properties of the dark counts is necessary.
The dark counts are often assumed to follow a Poisson process that is
statistically independent of the incident photon counts. This assumption must
be validated for specific types of photodetectors. In this work, we focus on
single-photon avalanche photodiodes (SPADs) made for 1550nm. For the InGaAs
detectors used, we find the measured distributions often differ significantly
from Poisson due to the presence of dead time and afterpulsing with the
difference increasing with the bias level. When the dead time is increased to
remove the effects of afterpulsing, it is necessary to correct the measured
distributions for the effects of the dead time. To this end, we apply an
iterative algorithm to remove dead time effects from the probability
distribution for dark counts as well as for the case where light from an
external weak laser source (known to be Poisson) is detected together with the
dark counts. We believe this to be the first instance of the comprehensive
application of this algorithm to real data and find that the corrected
probability distributions are Poisson distributions in both cases. We
additionally use the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm to estimate the entropy
production rates of the dark count processes, which provides a single metric
that characterizes the temporal correlations between dark counts as well as the
shape of the distribution. We have thus developed a systematic procedure for
taking data with 1550nm SPADs and obtaining accurate photocount statistics to
examine novel light sources.

point reached by the crests during breaking. The three breakers are created by
dispersively focused wave packets that differ primarily only through the
overall amplitude of the wave maker motion used to generate them. The breakers
are designated qualitatively by their intensities: weak, moderate and strong.
The droplets are measured with two in-line cinematic holographic systems
operating at 650 holograms per second with measurement volumes that span the
width of the tank. In combination with the wave profile measurements described
in Part 1 of this two part paper, the droplet measurements are used to explore
the mechanisms of droplet generation and the effects of these mechanisms on the
measured properties of the droplets and their motion. It is found that there
are four major mechanisms for droplet production, closure of the indentation
between the top surface of the plunging jet and the splash that it creates
(labeled Region I-A), the bursting of large bubbles that were entrapped under
the plunging jet at impact, splashing and bubble bursting in the turbulent zone
of the front face of the wave (combined with the large bursting bubbles in a
region labeled I-B) and the bursting of small bubbles that reach the water
surface at the crest of the nonbreaking wave following the breaker (Region II).
The droplet diameter distributions for the entire droplet set for each breaker
contain separate small- and large-diameter regions of power law behavior that
cross at a diameter, $d_i$, which increases monotonically from 820 $\mu$m to
1480 $\mu$m from the weak to the strong breaker, respectively. Similar power
law behavior is found in Regions I-A and I-B.

dispersively focused wave packets which are generated by a highly accurate
programmable wave maker. The wave maker motions that create the three breakers
differ primarily only by small changes in their overall amplitude. Breaker
profiles are measured with a cinematic laser induced fluorescence technique
covering a streamwise region of approximately one breaker wavelength and over a
time of 2.6 breaker periods. The 10 repeated sets of breaker profiles are
spatially and temporally aligned to the location and time of jet impact. The
aligned profile data is used to create spatio-temporal maps of the ensemble
average surface height and the standard deviation of both the local normal
distance and the local arc length relative to the instantaneous mean profile.
It is found that the mean and standard deviation maps contain strongly
correlated localized features and indicate that the transition from laminar to
turbulent flow is a highly repeatable process. Regions of high standard
deviation include the splash created by the plunging jet impact and subsequent
splash impacts at the front of the breaking region as well as the site where
the air pocket entrained under the plunging jet at the moment of jet tip impact
comes to the surface and pops on the back face of the wave. In Part 2, these
features are used to interpret various features of the distributions of droplet

evolved stars exhibiting mixed modes, avoided crossings between different
multiplet components are known to yield asymmetric rotational splitting,
particularly for near-degenerate mixed-mode pairs, where notional pure p-modes
are fortuitiously in resonance with pure g-modes. These near-degeneracy effects
have been described in subgiants, but their consequences for the
characterisation of internal rotation in red giants has not previously been
investigated in detail, in part owing to theoretical intractability. We employ
new developments in the analytic theory of mixed-mode coupling to study these
near-resonance phenomena. In the vicinity of the most p-dominated mixed modes,
the near-degenerate intrinsic asymmetry from pure rotational splitting
increases dramatically over the course of stellar evolution, and depends
strongly on the mode mixing fraction $\zeta$. We also find that a linear
treatment of rotation remains viable for describing the underlying p- and
g-modes, even when it does not for the resulting mixed modes undergoing these
avoided crossings. We explore observational consequences for potential
measurements of asymmetric mixed-mode splitting, which has been proposed as a
magnetic-field diagnostic. Finally, we propose improved measurement techniques

some hints were known of a possible connection between the quantum Hall effect

the electronic behavior in twisted bilayer graphene is studied using the chiral
model Hamiltonian. As a result, it is proved that for high-order magic angles,
the zero flat band modes converge into coherent Landau states with a dispersion
$\sigma^2=1/3\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is a coupling parameter that incorporates
the twist angle and energetic scales. Then it is proved that the square of the

to a two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. The interlayer currents

growing in popularity. They offer an opportunity to democratize and accelerate
research, as they have no publication costs or a lengthy peer review process.
Preprints are often later published in peer-reviewed venues, but these
publications and the original preprints are frequently not linked in any way.
To this end, we developed a tool, PreprintMatch, to find matches between
preprints and their corresponding published papers, if they exist. This tool
outperforms existing techniques to match preprints and papers, both on matching
performance and speed. PreprintMatch was applied to search for matches between
preprints (from bioRxiv and medRxiv), and PubMed. The preliminary nature of
preprints offers a unique perspective into scientific projects at a relatively
early stage, and with better matching between preprint and paper, we explored
questions related to research inequity. We found that preprints from low income
countries are published as peer-reviewed papers at a lower rate than high
income countries (39.6\% and 61.1\%, respectively), and our data is consistent
with previous work that cite a lack of resources, lack of stability, and policy
choices to explain this discrepancy. Preprints from low income countries were
also found to be published quicker (178 vs 203 days) and with less title,
abstract, and author similarity to the published version compared to high
income countries. Low income countries add more authors from the preprint to
the published version than high income countries (0.42 authors vs 0.32,
respectively), a practice that is significantly more frequent in China compared
to similar countries. Finally, we find that some publishers publish work with
authors from lower income countries more frequently than others. PreprintMatch

Yet, training on these datasets has not been enough to address the lack of

Given that contrastive pretraining optimizes for retrieval on datasets with

than $2\arcsec$. For the first part, which is roughly one third of the
published catalog, we synthesized 0.617 million redshifts by multiple machine
learning prediction and classification methods, using independent photometric
and astrometric data from Gaia EDR3 and WISE with accurate spectroscopic
redshifts from SDSS as a training set. Using these synthetic redshifts, we
estimate a rate of 4.9\% of interlopers with spectroscopic redshift below 1 in
this part of the catalog. Unresolved candidate double and dual AGNs and quasars
are selected as sources with marginally high BP/RP excess factor
(phot_bp_rp_excess_factor), which is sensitive to source extent, limiting our
search to high-redshift quasars. For the second part of the catalog, additional
filters on measured parallax and near-neighbor statistics are applied to
diminish the propagation of remaining stellar contaminants. The estimated rate
of positives (double or multiple sources) is 98\%, and the estimated rate of
dual (physically related quasars) is greater than 54\%. A few dozen

systems, mainly due to the ephemeral relevance of news to users. As social
media, and particularly microblogging applications like Twitter or Weibo, gains
popularity as platforms for news dissemination, personalized news
recommendation in this context becomes a significant challenge. We revisit news
recommendation in the microblogging scenario, by taking into consideration
social interactions and observations tracing how the information that is up for
recommendation spreads in an underlying network. We propose a deep-learning
based approach that is diffusion and influence-aware, called Influence-Graph
News Recommender (IGNiteR). It is a content-based deep recommendation model
that jointly exploits all the data facets that may impact adoption decisions,
namely semantics, diffusion-related features pertaining to local and global
influence among users, temporal attractiveness, and timeliness, as well as
dynamic user preferences. To represent the news, a multi-level attention-based
encoder is used to reveal the different interests of users. This news encoder
relies on a CNN for the news content and on an attentive LSTM for the diffusion
traces. For the latter, by exploiting previously observed news diffusions
(cascades) in the microblogging medium, users are mapped to a latent space that
captures potential influence on others or susceptibility of being influenced
for news adoptions. Similarly, a time-sensitive user encoder enables us to
capture the dynamic preferences of users with an attention-based bidirectional
LSTM. We perform extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, showing that
IGNiteR outperforms the state-of-the-art deep-learning based news
recommendation methods.

applications, such as loan approvals and candidate recruitment, among others,
and hence, biased or unfair model outputs can adversely impact individuals that
rely on these applications. To this end, many fair clustering approaches have
been recently proposed to counteract this issue. Due to the potential for
significant harm, it is essential to ensure that fair clustering algorithms
provide consistently fair outputs even under adversarial influence. However,
fair clustering algorithms have not been studied from an adversarial attack
perspective. In contrast to previous research, we seek to bridge this gap and
conduct a robustness analysis against fair clustering by proposing a novel
black-box fairness attack. Through comprehensive experiments, we find that
state-of-the-art models are highly susceptible to our attack as it can reduce
their fairness performance significantly. Finally, we propose Consensus Fair
Clustering (CFC), the first robust fair clustering approach that transforms
consensus clustering into a fair graph partitioning problem, and iteratively
learns to generate fair cluster outputs. Experimentally, we observe that CFC is
highly robust to the proposed attack and is thus a truly robust fair clustering
alternative.

and testing data. Due to its operator-dependent nature, acquisition-related
data mismatches, caused by different scanner settings, can occur in ultrasound
imaging. Therefore, mitigating effects of such data mismatches is essential for
wider clinical adoption of DL powered ultrasound imaging. To mitigate the
effects, ideally we need to collect a large training set at each scanner
setting. However, acquiring such training sets is expensive. Another approach
could be training on a subset of imaging settings, which makes the data
generation less expensive. However, there will still be generalization issues.
As an alternative approach that is inexpensive and generalizable, we propose to
collect a large training set at a single setting and a small calibration set at
each scanner setting. Then, the calibration set will be used to calibrate data
mismatches by using a signals and systems perspective. We tested the proposed
solution to classify two phantoms. To investigate generalizability of the
proposed solution, we calibrated three types of data mismatches: pulse
frequency, focus and output power mismatches. To calibrate the setting
mismatches, we calculated the setting transfer functions. The CNN trained with
no calibration resulted in mean classification accuracies of 55.3%, 64.4% and
70.3% for pulse frequency, focus and output power mismatches, respectively. By
using the setting transfer functions, which allowed a matching of the training
and testing domains, we obtained mean accuracies of 95.3%, 92.99% and 99.32%,

between scanner settings can provide an economical means of generalizing a DL

Furthermore, we find that PLMs can demonstrate behavior consistent with

setting. It is currently unclear which factors contribute to good calibration
(architecture, data augmentation, overparameterization, etc), though various
claims exist in the literature.
  We propose a systematic way to study the calibration error: by decomposing it
into (1) calibration error on the train set, and (2) the calibration
generalization gap. This mirrors the fundamental decomposition of
generalization. We then investigate each of these terms, and give empirical
evidence that (1) DNNs are typically always calibrated on their train set, and
(2) the calibration generalization gap is upper-bounded by the standard
generalization gap. Taken together, this implies that models with small
generalization gap (|Test Error - Train Error|) are well-calibrated. This
perspective unifies many results in the literature, and suggests that
interventions which reduce the generalization gap (such as adding data, using
heavy augmentation, or smaller model size) also improve calibration. We thus
hope our initial study lays the groundwork for a more systematic and
comprehensive understanding of the relation between calibration,

not. This is undesirable for operation. For a 2x2 example system with three
stationary points we demonstrate how to design a set of two single loop
controllers such that only one of the stationary points is locally stable, thus
effectively eliminating the ""input multiplicity problem"" for control. We also
show that when MPC is used for the example system, all three closed-loop

graph-structured data for various domains. However, GNNs are known as black-box
models that lack interpretability. Without understanding their inner working,
we cannot fully trust them, which largely limits their adoption in high-stake
scenarios. Though some initial efforts have been taken to interpret the
predictions of GNNs, they mainly focus on providing post-hoc explanations using
an additional explainer, which could misrepresent the true inner working
mechanism of the target GNN. The works on self-explainable GNNs are rather
limited. Therefore, we study a novel problem of learning prototype-based
self-explainable GNNs that can simultaneously give accurate predictions and
prototype-based explanations on predictions. We design a framework which can
learn prototype graphs that capture representative patterns of each class as
class-level explanations. The learned prototypes are also used to
simultaneously make prediction for for a test instance and provide
instance-level explanation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic
datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework for both prediction

origins of which are predominantly extragalactic and likely involve highly
magnetized compact objects. FRBs undergo multipath propagation, or scattering,
from electron density fluctuations on sub-parsec scales in ionized gas along
the line-of-sight. Scattering observations have located plasma structures
within FRB host galaxies, probed Galactic and extragalactic turbulence, and
constrained FRB redshifts. Scattering also inhibits FRB detection and biases
the observed FRB population. We report the detection of scattering times from
the repeating FRB 20190520B that vary by up to a factor of two or more on
minutes to days-long timescales. In one notable case, the scattering time
varied from $7.9\pm0.4$ ms to less than 3.1 ms ($95\%$ confidence) over 2.9
minutes at 1.45 GHz. The scattering times appear to be uncorrelated between
bursts or with dispersion and rotation measure variations. Scattering
variations are attributable to dynamic, inhomogeneous plasma in the
circumsource medium, and analogous variations have been observed from the Crab
pulsar. Under such circumstances, the frequency dependence of scattering can
deviate from the typical power-law used to measure scattering. Similar
variations may therefore be detectable from other FRBs, even those with
inconspicuous scattering, providing a unique probe of small-scale processes
within FRB environments.

increase the lifespan of a WSN system. Topology control mechanism (TCM) is a
renowned method to enhance the lifespan of WSN. This paper proposes an approach
to extend the lifetime of WSN for an economic area, targeting an economic zone
in Bangladesh. Observations are made on the performance of the network lifetime
considering the individual combinations of the TCM protocols and comparative
investigation between the time and energy triggering strategy of TCM protocols.
Results reveal the network makes a better performance in the case of A3
protocol while using the topology maintenance protocols with both time and
energy triggering methods. Moreover, the performance of the A3 and DGETRec is
superior to the other combinations of TCM protocols. Hence, the WSN system can
be able to serve better connectivity coverage in the target economic zone.

to the relative phonon intensities in the spontaneous Raman scattering spectrum

contributions of the Raman and non-Raman mechanisms to the coherent phonon
generation. We show that the particularly intense coherent Cu(2) phonon,

accuracy on previously learned tasks, as well as achieve high accuracy on
unseen tasks. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require to generate

learning to keep per-task parameter overhead small. Our work illustrates the
power of linearly combining individual impressions, each of which fares poorly
in isolation, to achieve performance comparable to a dedicated mask. Moreover,
even repeated impressions from the same task (homogeneous masks), when

applied bias voltage and resemble photoluminescence (PL) results, indicating
that, in both cases, the light emission is due to neutral and charged exciton
recombination. Interestingly, the electron injection rate, that is, the
tunneling current, can be used to control the ratio of charged to neutral
exciton emission. The obtained quantum yield in the transition metal
dichalcogenide (TMD) is $~5x10^{-7}$ photons per electron. The proposed
excitation mechanism is the direct injection of carriers into the conduction
band. The monolayer WSe$_2$ presents bright and dark defects spotted by STM
images performed under UHV. STS confirms the sample as p-doped, possibly as a
net result of the observed defects. The presence of an interfacial water layer
decouples the monolayer from the gold support and allows excitonic emission
from the WSe$_2$ monolayer. The creation of a water layer is an inherent
feature of the sample transferring process due to the ubiquitous air moisture.
Consequently, vacuum thermal annealing, which removes the water layer, quenches
excitonic luminescence from the TMD. The tunneling current can locally displace
water molecules leading to excitonic emission quenching and to plasmonic
emission due to the gold substrate. The present findings extend the use and the
understanding of STM induced light emission (STM-LE) on semiconducting TMDs to
probe exciton emission and dynamics with high spatial resolution.

symmetry breaking induced by the U(1) axial anomaly. Motivated by this
proposal, we examine whether this new mechanism works also in the NJL model. By
calculating the scalar meson masses, we find that the NJL model reproduces the
observed mass ordering with sufficient strength of the new term. With this
mechanism, it turns out that the constituent strange quark mass gets degenerate
to that of the up and down quark if the inverse mass ordering is reproduced. We
also discuss the scalar diquark masses to check the consistency of the
degeneracy of the constituent quark masses with the light baryon masses.

photoproduction, a systematic analysis of the contribution of quantum anomalous
energy (QAE) to the proton mass is carried out under the framework of the
vector meson dominance model. The results show that the effective Pomeron model
and the parametrized two gluon exchange model can explain the cross section of
$J/\psi$ photoproduction well. Based on the predicted cross section values
given by the two models, the distribution of the QAE contribution with the
energy is extracted for the first time. Finally, the average value of the QAE
contribution is estimated to be (3.50$\pm$0.70)$\%$, which suggests that the
QAE contribution to the proton mass is small. Accordingly, we compared this
result with those of other groups and explored the causes for the differences.

the conventional constitutive law in water dimer. That is, when the variation
in the O...O distance changes from stretching by 0.06 to contracting by -0.15
angstrom compared to the equilibrium position, the donor O-H bond length
decreases from 0.9724 to 0.9717 angstrom, and the O-H stretching frequency

low-dimensional nonparametric interaction models and covers the cases where the
covariates do not admit factor structures. Via diversified projections as
estimation of latent factor space, we employ truncated deep ReLU networks to
nonparametric factor regression without regularization and to a more general

We show that FAR-NN and FAST-NN estimators adapt to the unknown low-dimensional

  Estimation",,,"10.1145/3503161.3548394",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Depth map estimation from images is an important task in robotic systems.
Existing methods can be categorized into two groups including multi-view stereo
and monocular depth estimation. The former requires cameras to have large
overlapping areas and sufficient baseline between cameras, while the latter
that processes each image independently can hardly guarantee the structure
consistency between cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-camera
collaborative depth prediction method that does not require large overlapping
areas while maintaining structure consistency between cameras. Specifically, we
formulate the depth estimation as a weighted combination of depth basis, in
which the weights are updated iteratively by a refinement network driven by the
proposed consistency loss. During the iterative update, the results of depth
estimation are compared across cameras and the information of overlapping areas
is propagated to the whole depth maps with the help of basis formulation.
Experimental results on DDAD and NuScenes datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our method.

increasing attention from the graph machine learning community in recent years,
owing to its capability to learn performant node embeddings without costly
label information. One weakness of conventional SSL frameworks for GNNs is that
they learn through a single philosophy, such as mutual information maximization
or generative reconstruction. When applied to various downstream tasks, these
frameworks rarely perform equally well for every task, because one philosophy
may not span the extensive knowledge required for all tasks. To enhance the
task generalization across tasks, as an important first step forward in
exploring fundamental graph models, we introduce PARETOGNN, a multi-task SSL
framework for node representation learning over graphs. Specifically, PARETOGNN
is self-supervised by manifold pretext tasks observing multiple philosophies.
To reconcile different philosophies, we explore a multiple-gradient descent
algorithm, such that PARETOGNN actively learns from every pretext task while
minimizing potential conflicts. We conduct comprehensive experiments over four
downstream tasks (i.e., node classification, node clustering, link prediction,
and partition prediction), and our proposal achieves the best overall
performance across tasks on 11 widely adopted benchmark datasets. Besides, we
observe that learning from multiple philosophies enhances not only the task
generalization but also the single task performances, demonstrating that
PARETOGNN achieves better task generalization via the disjoint yet
complementary knowledge learned from different philosophies. Our code is

infectious probability of individuals. The proposed method can well keep the
privacy of individuals in the system since it does not require to know the
location or trajectory of each individual. Moreover, we also consider three
types of mobility models and the static model of individuals. Numerical results
show that analytical results well match with simulation results, thereby
validating the accuracy of the proposed model. Moreover, numerical results also
offer many insightful implications. Thereafter, we also offer a number of
countermeasures against the spread of COVID-19 based on wireless edge networks.
This study lays the foundation toward predicting the infectious risk in

the discriminative power of the face model by normalizing softmax to the cosine
space step by step and then adding a fixed penalty margin to reduce the
intra-class distance to increase the inter-class distance. Although a great
deal of previous work has been done to optimize the boundary penalty to improve
the discriminative power of the model, adding a fixed margin penalty to the
depth feature and the corresponding weight is not consistent with the pattern
of data in the real scenario. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose
a novel loss function, InterFace, releasing the constraint of adding a margin
penalty only between the depth feature and the corresponding weight to push the
separability of classes by adding corresponding margin penalties between the
depth features and all weights. To illustrate the advantages of InterFace over
a fixed penalty margin, we explained geometrically and comparisons on a set of

the community, and many methods are proposed to address this problem from a
knowledge transfer perspective. Though promising results have been achieved,
these methods fail to achieve shot-stable:~methods that excel in low-shot
regimes are likely to struggle in high-shot regimes, and vice versa. We believe
this is because the primary challenge of FSOD changes when the number of shots
varies. In the low-shot regime, the primary challenge is the lack of
inner-class variation. In the high-shot regime, as the variance approaches the
real one, the main hindrance to the performance comes from misalignment between
learned and true distributions. However, these two distinct issues remain
unsolved in most existing FSOD methods. In this paper, we propose to overcome
these challenges by exploiting rich knowledge the model has learned and
effectively transferring them to the novel classes. For the low-shot regime, we
propose a distribution calibration method to deal with the lack of inner-class
variation problem. Meanwhile, a shift compensation method is proposed to
compensate for possible distribution shift during fine-tuning. For the
high-shot regime, we propose to use the knowledge learned from ImageNet as
guidance for the feature learning in the fine-tuning stage, which will
implicitly align the distributions of the novel classes. Although targeted
toward different regimes, these two strategies can work together to further
improve the FSOD performance. Experiments on both the VOC and COCO benchmarks
show that our proposed method can significantly outperform the baseline method

GMMSeg with the strengths of both generative and discriminative models. With a

quantum systems, and has attracted a lot of recent interest, both theoretically
and experimentally. Since the seminal works by Thouless and Niu in 1983 and
1984, it is argued that the quantization of the pumped charge is robust against
weak disorder, but a clear characterization of the localization properties of
the relevant states, and the breakdown of quantized transport in the presence
of interaction or out of the adiabatic approximation, has been long debated.
Thouless pumping is also the first example of a topological phase emerging in a
periodically-driven system. Driven systems can exhibit exotic topological
phases without any static analogue and have been the subject of many recent
proposals both in fermionic and bosonic systems in diverse platforms ranging
from cold atoms to photonics and condensed matter systems. In this respect,
this review has a twofold purpose: On the one hand, it serves as a basis to
understand the robustness of the topology of slowly-driven systems per se; On
the other hand, it highlights the rich properties of topological pumps and
their diverse range of applications, for instance, in systems with synthetic
dimensions or for understanding higher-order topological phases. These examples
underline the relevance of topological pumping for the fast growing field of
topological quantum matter.

results in dust concentration against depletion due to the radial drift and
accelerates dust growth locally. In this work (Paper II), we perform numerical
simulations of coagulation instability taking into account effects of
backreaction to gas and collisional fragmentation of dust grains. We find that
the slowdown of the dust drift due to backreaction regulates dust concentration
in the nonlinear growth phase of coagulation instability. The dust-to-gas
surface density ratio increases from $10^{-3}$ up to $\sim10^{-2}$. Each
resulting dust ring tends to have mass of $\simeq0.5M_{\oplus}-1.5M_{\oplus}$
in our disk model. In contrast to Paper I, the dust surface density profile
shows a local plateau structure at each dust ring. In spite of the regulation
at the nonlinear growth, the efficient dust concentration reduces their
collision velocity. As a result, dust grains can grow beyond the fragmentation
barrier, and the dimensionless stopping time reaches unity as in Paper I. The
necessary condition for the efficient dust growth is (1) weak turbulence of
$\alpha<1\times10^{-3}$ and (2) a large critical velocity for dust
fragmentation ($> 1$ m/s). The efficient dust concentration in outer regions
will reduce the inward pebble flux and is expected to decelerate the planet
formation via the pebble accretion. We also find that the resulting rings can
be unstable to secular gravitational instability (GI). The subsequent secular
GI promotes planetesimal formation. We thus expect that a combination of these
instabilities is a promising mechanism for dust-ring and planetesimal
formation.

Recently, active RIS is introduced to combat the double fading effect by
actively amplifying incident signals with the aid of integrated reflection-type
amplifiers. In order to reduce the hardware cost and energy consumption due to
massive active components in the conventional fully-connected active RIS, a
novel hardware-and-energy efficient sub-connected active RIS architecture has
been proposed recently, in which multiple reconfigurable electromagnetic
elements are driven by only one amplifier. In this paper, we first develop an
improved and accurate signal model for the sub-connected active RIS
architecture. Then, we investigate the joint transmit precoding and RIS
reflection beamforming (i.e., the reflection phase-shift and amplification
coefficients) designs in multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO)
communication systems. Both sum-rate maximization and power minimization
problems are solved by leveraging fractional programming (FP), block coordinate
descent (BCD), second-order cone programming (SOCP), alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM), and majorization-minimization (MM) methods.
Extensive simulation results verify that compared with the conventional
fully-connected structure, the proposed sub-connected active RIS can
significantly reduce the hardware cost and power consumption, and achieve great
performance improvement when power budget at RIS is limited.

several possibilities for designing novel devices. Yet a more promising way of
designing exotic heterostutures with improved physical properties is to grow a
monolayer of these materials on a substrate. For example, in the field of
superconductivity it has been demonstrated that the superconducting transition
temperature of a monolayer of FeSe grown on some oxide substrates e.g.,
strontium titanate (STO) is by far higher than its bulk counterpart. Although
the system has been considered as a model system for understanding the
phenomenon of high-temperature superconductivity, the physical mechanism
responsible for this high transition temperature is still highly under debate.
Here using momentum and energy resolved high-resolution electron energy-loss
spectroscopy we probe the dynamic charge response of the FeSe/STO(001) system
and demonstrate that the frequency- and momentum-dependent dynamic charge
response is not compatible with a simple film/substrate model. Our analysis
reveals the existence of a depletion region at the interface between this Van
der Waals monolayer and the substrate. The presence of the depletion layer,
accompanied with a considerably large charge transfer from STO into the FeSe
monolayer, leads to a strong renormalization of the STO energy bands and a
substantial band bending at the interface. Our results shed light on the
electronic complexities of the FeSe/oxide interfaces and pave the way of
designing novel low-dimensional high-temperature superconductors through
interface engineering. We anticipate that the observed phenomenon is rather
general and can take place in many two dimensional Van der Waals monolayers
brought in contact with dielectric oxides or semiconducting substrates.

is significantly smaller than the red clump phase for this mass and
metallicity. Masses and radii from corrected asteroseismic scaling relations

is assumed, but a best scaling method could not be identified. We measured
dynamical masses and radii with a precision better than 1.0%. We firmly
establish the evolutionary nature of the system to be that of two early RGB

are lightweight while effective in filling the gap between edge feature
learning and performance enhancement of graph classification. The edge feature
scheme makes edge features adapt to node representations at different graph
convolution layers. The add-on layers help adjust the edge features to an
optimal graph structure. To test the effectiveness of our method, we take
Euclidean positions as initial node features and extract graphs with semantic

are more scalable for edge feature learning than most existing graph datasets

gravitational waves (GWs), causing the lensing effect. Particularly, the weak
lensing of GWs contains abundance of information about the small scale matter
power spectrum and it has been studied within the range of the Born
approximation. In this work, we investigate the validity of the Born
approximation by accounting for the higher order terms in the gravitational
potential $\Phi$. We first develop the formulation of the post-Born
approximation, which is made by introducing a new variable. We then derive the
expression of the magnitude and the phase of the amplification factor up to
third order in $\Phi$ and compute the average and variance beyond the Born
approximation. Our results suggest that the post-Born effect is indeed a few
orders of magnitude smaller than the leading order contribution within almost
all frequency ranges considered in this work except for the high frequency area
$f\sim1000$ Hz, where the shot noise is dominant. Intriguingly, the number of
necessary GW events for detecting the average, which originates purely from the
post-Born effect, could become comparable or even smaller than the number
required for detecting the variance, which appears at the level of the Born
approximation. This indicates that the average is measurable with the same
detection cost as the variance, even though it is only a few percent of the
variance. On the other hand, we find that, even though the detection of the
post-Born corrections to the variance would be possible in the case of the
magnification, extracting the useful information to infer the shape of the
matter power spectrum is still challenging even for the future generation GW
detectors. This is due to the smallness of the post-Born effect and the
difficulty of separating it from both the noise signal and the Born
approximation effect.

deviate from the theoretical predictions, yielding for example a non-quantized

results might be compatible with a topological ground state, it is also
possible that a trivial scenario can mimic similar results, by means of
accidental zero energy Andreev bound states (ZEABS) or simply by non-adiabatic
transitions between trivial Andreev bound states. Here, we propose a new

spin-momentum locking, accumulate different magnetic flux and therefore become
distinguishable in the Fraunhofer periodicity. Furthermore, we introduce a

bioinformatics, and combinatorics on words. Let $S = XaY$ be a string, where
$X$ and $Y$ are of the same length and $a$ is either a single character or the
empty string. Then, there exist two alternative definitions for palindromes:
$S$ is said to be a palindrome if: Reversal-based definition: $S$ is equal to
its reversal $S^R$; Symmetry-based definition: its left-arm $X$ is equal to the
reversal of its right-arm $Y^R$. It is clear that if the ""equality"" ($\approx$)
used in both definitions is exact character matching ($=$), then the two
definitions are the same. However, if we apply other string-equality criteria
$\approx$, including the complementary model for biological sequences, the
parameterized model [Baker, JCSS 1996], the order-preserving model [Kim et al.,
TCS 2014], the Cartesian-tree model [Park et al., TCS 2020], and the
palindromic-structure model [I et al., TCS 2013], then are the reversal-based
palindromes and the symmetry-based palindromes the same? To the best of our
knowledge, no previous work has considered or answered this natural question.
In this paper, we first provide answers to this question, and then present
efficient algorithms for computing all maximal generalized palindromes that
occur in a given string. After confirming that Gusfield's offline suffix-tree
based algorithm for computing maximal symmetry-based palindromes can be readily
extended to the aforementioned matching models, we show how to extend
Manacher's online algorithm for computing maximal reversal-based palindromes in
linear time for all the aforementioned matching models.

related to the spectrum of bound states of the corresponding potential wells.
This property has been widely used to compute black hole quasi-normal modes,
but it is limited to a few ""approximate"" potentials with certain transformation
properties for which the spectrum of bound states must be known analytically.
In this work we circumvent this limitation by proposing an approach that allows
one to make use of potentials with similar transformation properties, but where
the spectrum of bound states can also be computed numerically. Because the
numerical calculation of bound states is usually more stable than the direct
computation of the corresponding quasi-normal modes, the new approach is also
interesting from a technical point of view. We apply the method to different
potentials, including the P\""oschl-Teller potential for which all steps can be
understood analytically, as well as potentials for which we are not aware of
analytic results but provide independent numerical results for comparison. As a
canonical test, all potentials are chosen to match the Regge-Wheeler potential
of axial perturbations of the Schwarzschild black hole. We find that the new
approximate potentials are more suitable to approximate the exact quasi-normal
modes than the P\""oschl-Teller potential, particularly for the first overtone.
We hope this work opens new perspectives to the computation of quasi-normal
modes and finds further improvements and generalizations in the future.

of roles do the dynamics prediction modules play during the physical reasoning

treating physical reasoning as a downstream task without investigating the
questions above, taking for granted that the designed dynamics prediction would
undoubtedly help the reasoning process. In this work, we take a closer look at
this assumption, exploring this fundamental hypothesis by comparing two
learning mechanisms: Learning from Dynamics (LfD) and Learning from Intuition
(LfI). In the first experiment, we directly examine and compare these two
mechanisms. Results show a surprising finding: Simple LfI is better than or on
par with state-of-the-art LfD. This observation leads to the second experiment
with Ground-truth Dynamics, the ideal case of LfD wherein dynamics are obtained
directly from a simulator. Results show that dynamics, if directly given
instead of approximated, would achieve much higher performance than LfI alone
on physical reasoning; this essentially serves as the performance upper bound.
Yet practically, LfD mechanism can only predict Approximate Dynamics using
dynamics learning modules that mimic the physical laws, making the following
downstream physical reasoning modules degenerate into the LfI paradigm; see the
third experiment. We note that this issue is hard to mitigate, as dynamics
prediction errors inevitably accumulate in the long horizon. Finally, in the
fourth experiment, we note that LfI, the extremely simpler strategy when done
right, is more effective in learning to solve physical reasoning problems.
Taken together, the results on the challenging benchmark of PHYRE show that LfI
is, if not better, as good as LfD for dynamics prediction. However, the
potential improvement from LfD, though challenging, remains lucrative.

learning~(SSL) of visual representations with Vision Transformers. A
representative MIM model, the masked auto-encoder (MAE), randomly masks a
subset of image patches and reconstructs the masked patches given the unmasked
patches. Concurrently, many recent works in self-supervised learning utilize
the student/teacher paradigm which provides the student with an additional
target based on the output of a teacher composed of an exponential moving
average (EMA) of previous students. Although common, relatively little is known
about the dynamics of the interaction between the student and teacher. Through
analysis on a simple linear model, we find that the teacher conditionally
removes previous gradient directions based on feature similarities which
effectively acts as a conditional momentum regularizer. From this analysis, we
present a simple SSL method, the Reconstruction-Consistent Masked Auto-Encoder
(RC-MAE) by adding an EMA teacher to MAE. We find that RC-MAE converges faster
and requires less memory usage than state-of-the-art self-distillation methods
during pre-training, which may provide a way to enhance the practicality of
prohibitively expensive self-supervised learning of Vision Transformer models.
Additionally, we show that RC-MAE achieves more robustness and better
performance compared to MAE on downstream tasks such as ImageNet-1K
classification, object detection, and instance segmentation.

dressed PBHs in detail. We find that all the microlensing effects by dressed
PBHs have asymptotic behavior depending on the minihalo size, which can be used
to predict the microlensing effects by comparing the halo size with the
Einstein radius. When the minihalo radius and the Einstein radius are
comparable, the effect of the density distribution of the halo is significant
to the microlensing. Applying the stellar microlensing by dressed PBHs to the
data of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment and Subaru/HSC Andromeda
observations, we obtain the improved constraints on the PBH abundance. It shows
that the existence of dark matter minihalos surrounding PBHs can strengthen the
constraints on the PBH abundance from stellar microlensing by several orders,
and can shift the constraints to the well-known asteroid mass window where PBHs
can constitute all the dark matter.

the annual energy production (AEP) of a wind farm. AYC efficiency depends on
the wind direction and the wind farm layout because an AYC method utilizes wake
deflection by yawing wind turbines. Conventional optimization of a wind farm
layout assumed that the swept areas of all wind turbines are aligned
perpendicular to the wind direction, thereby allowing non-optimal utilization
of an AYC method. Higher AEP can be obtained by joint optimization which
considers an AYC method in the layout design stage. Joint optimization of the
farm layout and AYC has been difficult due to the non-convexity of the problem
and the computational inefficiency. In the present study, a particle swarm
optimization based method is developed for joint optimization. The layout is
optimized with simultaneous consideration for yaw angles for all wind
velocities to obtain a globally optimal layout. A number of random initial
particles consisting of the layout and yaw angles of wind turbines reduce the
initial layout dependency on the optimized layout. To deal with the challenge
of large-scale optimization, the adaptive granularity learning distributed
particle swarm optimization algorithm is implemented. The improvement in AEP
when using a jointly optimized layout compared to a conventionally optimized
layout in a real wind farm is demonstrated using the present method.

rising business problems. Modeling the database and the software architecture
can be challenging, hence there not being one combined modeling language for
database and software architecture, specifically suited for web application
development. In this paper we present Database object-oriented Modeling
Language (DooML) and its primary Archetype Diagram: a notation for specifying
the design of a database schema and corresponding object-oriented software
architecture. It combines the syntax for drawing Entity Relationship Diagrams,
the Relational Model and Universal Modeling Language Class Diagrams as well to
create a mixed diagram, stating database design as well as software design
specifications. By default, DooML ensures that the approach of advanced web
application development is model-driven and both database-oriented as well as
object-oriented.

distance measurements of classical Cepheids (DCEPs). The precise distance
provided by an associated open cluster independently calibrates the
period--Wesenheit relation of DCEPs. 51 DCEPs associated with open clusters are
compiled using the constraints of five-dimensional astrometric information. By
directly using Gaia DR3 parallax, the period--Wesenheit relation in the Gaia
$G$ band is calibrated as $W_G = (-3.06 \pm 0.11) \log P + (-2.96 \pm 0.10)$.
Compared with the results derived by directly adopting the DCEP parallaxes or
using distance moduli, the Wesenheit magnitudes based on the cluster-averaged
parallaxes exhibit a tighter relation with the period. Besides, there is a
systematic offset between the observed Wesenheit absolute magnitudes of distant
OC-DCEPs and their fitted magnitudes. After considering the parallax zero-point
correction, the systematic offset can be reduced, yielding a probably better PW
relation of $W_G = (-2.94 \pm 0.12) \log P + (-2.93 \pm 0.11)$.

cross-domain problem with fine source domain labels. However, the acquisition
of semantic labels has always been a difficult step, many scenarios only have
weak labels (e.g. bounding boxes). For scenarios where weak supervision and
cross-domain problems coexist, this paper defines a new task: unsupervised
domain adaptation based on weak source domain labels (WUDA). To explore
solutions for this task, this paper proposes two intuitive frameworks: 1)
Perform weakly supervised semantic segmentation in the source domain, and then
implement unsupervised domain adaptation; 2) Train an object detection model
using source domain data, then detect objects in the target domain and
implement weakly supervised semantic segmentation. We observe that the two
frameworks behave differently when the datasets change. Therefore, we construct
dataset pairs with a wide range of domain shifts and conduct extended
experiments to analyze the impact of different domain shifts on the two
frameworks. In addition, to measure domain shift, we apply the metric
representation shift to urban landscape image segmentation for the first time.

interest, whether for data augmentation, scenario simulation, completing
missing data, or other purposes. Recent works proposed a Transformer-based Time
series generative adversarial network (TTS-GAN) to address the limitations of
recurrent neural networks. However, this model assumes a unimodal distribution
and tries to generate samples around the expectation of the real data
distribution. One of its limitations is that it may generate a random
multivariate time series; it may fail to generate samples in the presence of
multiple sub-components within an overall distribution. One could train models
to fit each sub-component separately to overcome this limitation. Our work
extends the TTS-GAN by conditioning its generated output on a particular
encoded context allowing the use of one model to fit a mixture distribution
with multiple sub-components. Technically, it is a conditional generative
adversarial network that models realistic multivariate time series under
different types of conditions, such as categorical variables or multivariate
time series. We evaluate our model on UniMiB Dataset, which contains
acceleration data following the XYZ axes of human activities collected using
Smartphones. We use qualitative evaluations and quantitative metrics such as
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and we introduce a modified version of the
Frechet inception distance (FID) to measure the performance of our model and
the statistical similarities between the generated and the real data
distributions. We show that this transformer-based CGAN can generate realistic
high-dimensional and long data sequences under different kinds of conditions.

multi-antenna base stations are connected to the cloud via capacity-limited

computational capabilities. The paper then considers the problem of maximizing
the weighted network sum-rate subject to per-user delay, computational

computation allocations. Such intricate non-convex optimization problem is
tackled using an iterative algorithm that relies on $\ell_0$-norm relaxation,
successive convex approximation, and fractional programming, and has the
compelling ability to be implemented in a distributed fashion across the
multiple UAVs and the CC. The paper results illustrate the numerical prospects

efficiency in a wide range of applications. However, the existing methods
exorbitantly concentrate on the inter-layer feature interactions but ignore the
intra-layer feature regulations, which are empirically proved beneficial.
Although some methods try to learn a compact intra-layer feature representation
with the help of the attention mechanism or the vision transformer, they ignore
the neglected corner regions that are important for dense prediction tasks. To
address this problem, in this paper, we propose a Centralized Feature Pyramid
(CFP) for object detection, which is based on a globally explicit centralized
feature regulation. Specifically, we first propose a spatial explicit visual
center scheme, where a lightweight MLP is used to capture the globally
long-range dependencies and a parallel learnable visual center mechanism is
used to capture the local corner regions of the input images. Based on this, we
then propose a globally centralized regulation for the commonly-used feature
pyramid in a top-down fashion, where the explicit visual center information
obtained from the deepest intra-layer feature is used to regulate frontal
shallow features. Compared to the existing feature pyramids, CFP not only has
the ability to capture the global long-range dependencies, but also efficiently
obtain an all-round yet discriminative feature representation. Experimental
results on the challenging MS-COCO validate that our proposed CFP can achieve
the consistent performance gains on the state-of-the-art YOLOv5 and YOLOX
object detection baselines.

parent body have been identified using clustering methods of asteroids in their
proper orbital element space. An alternative method has been developed in order
to identify collisional families from the correlation between the asteroid
fragment sizes and their proper semi-major axis distance from the family centre
(V-shape). This method has been shown to be effective in the cases of the very
diffuse families that formed billions of years ago. We obtained photometric
observations of asteroids in order to construct their rotational light curves;
we combine them with the literature light curves and sparse-in-time photometry;
we input these data in the light curve inversion methods to determine the shape
and the spin pole of the asteroids in order to assess whether an object is
prograde or retrograde. The ultimate goal is to assess whether we find an
excess of retrograde asteroids on the inward side of the V-shape of a 4 Gyr
asteroid family identified via the V-shape method. This excess of retrograde
rotators is predicted by the theory of asteroid family evolution. We obtained
the spin poles for 55 asteroids claimed to belong to a 4 Gyr collisional family
of the inner main belt that consists of low-albedo asteroids. After
re-evaluating the albedo and spectroscopic information, we found that nine of
these asteroids are interlopers in the 4 Gyr family. Of the 46 remaining
asteroids, 31 are found to be retrograde and 15 prograde. We also found that
these retrograde rotators have a very low probability (1.29%) of being due to
random sampling from an underlying uniform distribution of spin poles. Our
results constitute corroborating evidence that the asteroids identified as
members of a 4 Gyr collisional family have a common origin, thus strengthening

with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Despite their great academic success,
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) remain the primary workhorse for practical
industrial applications. One reason for this academic-industrial gap is the
neighborhood-fetching latency incurred by data dependency in GNNs, which make
it hard to deploy for latency-sensitive applications that require fast
inference. Conversely, without involving any feature aggregation, MLPs have no
data dependency and infer much faster than GNNs, but their performance is less
competitive. Motivated by these complementary strengths and weaknesses, we
propose a Graph Self-Distillation on Neighborhood (GSDN) framework to reduce
the gap between GNNs and MLPs. Specifically, the GSDN framework is based purely
on MLPs, where structural information is only implicitly used as prior to guide
knowledge self-distillation between the neighborhood and the target,
substituting the explicit neighborhood information propagation as in GNNs. As a
result, GSDN enjoys the benefits of graph topology-awareness in training but
has no data dependency in inference. Extensive experiments have shown that the
performance of vanilla MLPs can be greatly improved with self-distillation,
e.g., GSDN improves over stand-alone MLPs by 15.54% on average and outperforms
the state-of-the-art GNNs on six datasets. Regarding inference speed, GSDN
infers 75X-89X faster than existing GNNs and 16X-25X faster than other
inference acceleration methods.

tasks, but to make more effective use of those already on hand. This paper
studies the problem of how to automatically, adaptively, and dynamically learn
instance-level self-supervised learning strategies for each node from a given
pool of pretext tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-teacher
knowledge distillation framework for Automated Graph Self-Supervised Learning
(AGSSL), which consists of two main branches: (i) Knowledge Extraction:
training multiple teachers with different pretext tasks, so as to extract
different levels of knowledge with different inductive biases; (ii) Knowledge
Integration: integrating different levels of knowledge and distilling them into
the student model. Without simply treating different teachers as equally
important, we provide a provable theoretical guideline for how to integrate the
knowledge of different teachers, i.e., the integrated teacher probability
should be close to the true Bayesian class-probability. To approach the
theoretical optimum in practice, two adaptive knowledge integration strategies
are proposed to construct a relatively ""good"" integrated teacher. Extensive
experiments on eight datasets show that AGSSL can benefit from multiple pretext
tasks, outperforming the corresponding individual tasks; by combining a few
simple but classical pretext tasks, the resulting performance is comparable to
other leading counterparts.

where higher-order corrections have to be included in order to match the
measured Higgs mass value at the precision of current experiments. Closely
related through the Higgs potential are the Higgs self-interactions. In
addition, the measurement of the trilinear Higgs self-coupling provides the
first step towards the reconstruction of the Higgs potential and the
experimental verification of the Higgs mechanism sui generis. In this paper, we
advance our prediction of the trilinear Higgs self-couplings in the
CP-violating Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the SM (NMSSM). We
provide the ${\cal O}(\alpha_t^2)$ corrections in the gaugeless limit at
vanishing external momenta. The higher-order corrections turn out to be larger
than the corresponding mass corrections but show the expected perturbative
convergence. The inclusion of the loop-corrected effective trilinear Higgs
self-coupling in gluon fusion into Higgs pairs and the estimate of the
theoretical uncertainty due to missing higher-order corrections indicate that
the missing electroweak higher-order corrections may be significant.

physical effects and extend practical scientific applications, which has been
advanced by accepting methods of quantum optics - many classical analogies of
exotic quantum states were designed using structured modes. However, the
prevailing quantum-like structured modes are limited by discrete states where
the mode index is analog to the photon number state. Yet, beyond discrete
states, there is a broad range of quantum states to be explored in the field of
structured light -- continuous-variable (CV) states. As a typical example of CV
states, squeezed state plays a prominent role in high-sensitivity
interferometry and gravitational wave detection. In this work, we bring
together two seemingly disparate branches of physics, namely, classical
structured light and quantum squeezed state. We propose the structured light
analogy of squeezed state (SLASS), which can break the spatial limit following
the process of surpassing the standard quantum limit (SQL) with quantum
squeezed states. This work paves the way for adopting methods from CV quantum
states into structured light, opening new research directions of CV
entanglement, teleportation, classical and quantum informatics of structured

in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) theory. In this paper, we examine the impact
of FFC on explosive nucleosynthesis by including the effects of FFC in
conjunction with asymmetric neutrino emission into nucleosynthetic computations
in a parametric way. We find that the ejecta compositions are not appreciably
affected by FFC for elements lighter than Co, while the compositions are
influenced by FFC for the heavier elements. We also find that the role of FFC
varies depending on the asymmetric degree of neutrino emission ($m_{\rm asy}$)
and the degree of neutrino-flavor mixing. The impact of FFC is not monotonic to
$m_{\rm asy}$; The change in the ejecta composition increases for higher
$m_{\rm asy}$ up to $\sim 10\%$ compared with that without FFC, whereas FFC has
little effect on the nucleosynthesis in very large asymmetric neutrino emission
($\gtrsim 30 \%$). Our results suggest that FFC facilitates the production of
neutron-rich ejecta in most cases, although it makes the ejecta more
proton-rich if anti-neutrino conversion is more vigorous than that of neutrino.
The key ingredient accounting for this trend is neutrino absorption, whose
effects on nucleosynthesis can be quantified by simple diagnostics.

First, we provide a simplified and improved proof of global-in-time
well-posedness of the Boussinesq equations with strongly damped vorticity in

symmetrization of the approximating system and a careful study of the
anisotropic properties of the equations via anisotropic Littlewood-Paley
decomposition play key roles to obtain uniform energy estimates. Finally, one
of the main new and crucial points is the integrable time decay of the vertical

random subset of a set of $m$ labels by including each label independently with
probability $p$ and edges are drawn between vertices that have at least one
label in common. Among other applications, such graphs have been used to model
social networks, in which individuals correspond to vertices and various
features (e.g. ideas, interests) correspond to labels; individuals sharing at
least one common feature are connected and this is abstracted by edges in
random intersection graphs. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding
maximum cliques when the input graph is $G_{n,m,p}$. Current algorithms for
this problem are successful with high probability only for relatively sparse
instances, leaving the dense case mostly unexplored. We present a spectral
algorithm for finding large cliques that processes vertices according to
respective values in the second largest eigenvector of the adjacency matrix of
induced subgraphs of the input graph corresponding to common neighbors of small
cliques. Leveraging on the Single Label Clique Theorem from [15], we were able
to construct random instances, without the need to externally plant a large
clique in the input graph. In particular, we used label choices to determine
the maximum clique and then concealed label information by just giving the
adjacency matrix of $G_{n, m, p}$ as input to the algorithm. Our experimental
evaluation showed that our spectral algorithm clearly outperforms existing
polynomial time algorithms, both with respect to the failure probability and
the approximation guarantee metrics, especially in the dense regime, thus
suggesting that spectral properties of random intersection graphs may be also
used to construct efficient algorithms for other NP-hard graph theoretical

model. SIR-HUXt is designed to assimilate the time-elongation profiles of CME
fronts in the low heliosphere, such as those typically extracted from
heliospheric imager data returned by the STEREO, Parker Solar Probe, and Solar
Orbiter missions. We use Observing System Simulation Experiments to explore the
performance of SIR-HUXt for a simple synthetic CME scenario of a fully Earth
directed CME flowing through a uniform ambient solar wind, where the CME is
initialised with the average observed CME speed and width. These experiments
are performed for a range of observer locations, from 20 deg to 90 deg behind
Earth, spanning the L5 point where ESA's future Vigil space weather monitor
will return heliospheric imager data for operational space weather forecasting.
  We show that SIR-HUXt performs well at constraining the CME speed, and has
some success at constraining the CME longitude. The CME width is largely
unconstrained by the SIR-HUXt assimilations, and more experiments are required
to determine if this is due to this specific CME scenario, or is a general
feature of assimilating time-elongation profiles. Rank-histograms suggest that
the SIR-HUXt ensembles are well calibrated, with no clear indications of bias
or under/over dispersion. Improved constraints on the initial CME speed lead
directly to improvements in the CME transit time to Earth and arrival speed.
For an observer in the L5 region, SIR-HUXt returned a 69% reduction in the CME
transit time uncertainty, and a 63% reduction in the arrival speed uncertainty.
This suggests SIR-HUXt has potential to improve the real-world representivity
of HUXt simulations, and therefore has potential to reduce the uncertainty of
CME arrival time hindcasts and forecasts.

So far, XAI-based explanations pursue a technology-focused approach -
neglecting the influence of users' cognitive abilities and differences in

takes a human-centered perspective and incorporates insights from cognitive

Applying a between-subject experiment design, we investigate how users'

method of fabricating twisted vdW heterostructures made of Bi2Sr2CuCa2O8+d,
crucially improving the JJ characteristics, pushing them up to those of the
intrinsic JJs in bulk samples. The method combines a cryogenic stacking using a
solvent-free stencil mask technique and covering interface by the insulating
hexagonal boron nitride crystals. Despite the high-vacuum condition down to
10-6 mbar in the evaporation chamber, the interface appears to be protected
from water molecules during the in-situ metal deposition only when fully
encapsulated. Comparing the current-voltage curves of encapsulated and
unencapsulated interfaces, we reveal that the encapsulated interfaces'
characteristics are crucially improved so that the corresponding JJs
demonstrate high critical currents and sharpness of the superconducting
transition comparable to those of the intrinsic JJs. Finally, we show that the

high-quality state estimation module. Especially when the motion includes
flight phases, state-of-the-art approaches fail to produce reliable estimation
of the robot posture, in particular base height. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach for combining visual-inertial odometry (VIO) with leg odometry
in an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based state estimator. The VIO module uses a
stereo camera and IMU to yield low-drift 3D position and yaw orientation and
drift-free pitch and roll orientation of the robot base link in the inertial
frame. However, these values have a considerable amount of latency due to image
processing and optimization, while the rate of update is quite low which is not
suitable for low-level control. To reduce the latency, we predict the VIO state
estimate at the rate of the IMU measurements of the VIO sensor. The EKF module
uses the base pose and linear velocity predicted by VIO, fuses them further
with a second high-rate IMU and leg odometry measurements, and produces robot
state estimates with a high frequency and small latency suitable for control.
We integrate this lightweight estimation framework with a nonlinear model
predictive controller and show successful implementation of a set of agile
locomotion behaviors, including trotting and jumping at varying horizontal
speeds, on a torque-controlled quadruped robot.

technology adapted to the pitch and die sizes of the respective applications.
During the ASIC and sensor R\&D phase, especially for small-scale applications,
such interconnect technologies need to be suitable for the assembly of single
dies, typically available from Multi-Project-Wafer submissions. Within the CERN
EP R&D programme and the AIDAinnova collaboration, innovative hybridisation
concepts targeting vertex-detector applications at future colliders are under
development. Recent results of two novel interconnect methods for pixel pitches
of 25um and 55um are presented in this contribution -- an industrial fine-pitch
SnAg solder bump-bonding process adapted to single-die processing using support
wafers, as well as a newly developed in-house single-die interconnection
process based on ACF.
  The fine-pitch bump-bonding process is qualified with hybrid assemblies from
a recent bonding campaign at Frauenhofer IZM. Individual CLICpix2 ASICs with
25um pixel pitch were bump-bonded to active-edge silicon sensors with
thicknesses ranging from 50um to 130um. The device characterisation was
conducted in the laboratory as well as during a beam test campaign at the CERN
SPS beam-line, demonstrating an interconnect yield of about 99.7%.
  The ACF interconnect technology replaces the solder bumps by conductive
micro-particles embedded in an epoxy film. The electro-mechanical connection
between the sensor and ASIC is achieved via thermocompression of the ACF using
a flip-chip device bonder. The required pixel pad topology is achieved with an
in-house ENIG plating process. This newly developed ACF hybridisation process
is first qualified with the Timepix3 ASICs and sensors with 55um pixel pitch.
The technology can be also used for ASIC-PCB/FPC integration, replacing wire
bonding or large-pitch solder bumping techniques.

be used to probe structure and dynamics in the tail. Such occultations are
rare, and the occurrence of scintillation, due to small-scale density
variations in the tail, remains somewhat controversial. Aims. A detailed
observation taken with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) of a serendipitous
occultation of the compact radio source 3C196 by the plasma tail of comet
C/2020 F3 (Neowise) is presented. 3C196 tracked almost perpendicularly behind
the tail, providing a unique profile cut only a short distance downstream from
the cometary nucleus itself. Methods. Interplanetary scintillation (IPS) is
observed as the rapid variation of the intensity received of a compact radio
source due to density variations in the solar wind. IPS in the signal received
from 3C196 was observed for five hours, covering the full transit behind the
plasma tail of comet C/2020 F3 (Neowise) on 16 July 2020, and allowing an
assessment of the solar wind in which the comet and its tail are embedded.
Results. The results reveal a sudden and strong enhancement in scintillation
which is unequivocally attributable to the plasma tail. The strongest
scintillation is associated with the tail boundaries, weaker scintillation is
seen within the tail, and previously-unreported periodic variations in
scintillation are noted, possibly associated with individual filaments of
plasma. Furthermore, contributions from the solar wind and comet tail are
separated to measure a sharp decrease in the velocity of material within the
tail, suggesting a steep velocity shear resulting in strong turbulence along
the tail boundary

velocity fluctuations in the background of the unperturbed star can dissipate
into Lagrangian displacement of fluid trajectories of the dense matter.
Interestingly in a simple way, a constant (in time) coefficient of dissipation
is obtained without a delta correlated noise. This formalism is also extended

states. Therefore, hybrid systems consisting of such magnetic molecules and
suitable carriers from the family of two-dimensional materials are often
considered as promising highly scalable spintronic systems that could in the
near future lead to novel industrial applications. Here, we perform the spin
polarised density functional theory (DFT) studies of the hybrid system, which
is the iron phthalocyanine molecule (FePc) on the top of the titanium carbide
Ti$_2$C MXene layer. The most relevant issue in this part is the interaction
between magnetic atoms: Ti from MXene substrate and iron from FePc. Four
various magnetic configurations of FePc/Ti$_2$C were considered. The
significant ferromagnetic interaction between the iron atom and the upper
titanium layer plays important role in the reorientation of the iron atom's
magnetic moment. We also analyse a model of the system in which the FePc
molecule is in a quintet state (the ground state of an isolated molecule is a
triplet). To get a better understanding of the physics of the FePc/Ti$_2$C
hybrid system, we studied the hybrid systems with a single iron atom and
non-magnetic H$_2$Pc on the Ti$_2$C layer, Fe/Ti$_2$C and H$_2$Pc/Ti$_2$C,
respectively, which nicely explains the role of the Pc ligand in the
FePc/Ti$_2$C hybrid system.

  International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA 2022)",,,,"cs.LG cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine learning (ML) applications continue to revolutionize many domains. In
recent years, there has been considerable research interest in building novel
ML applications for a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) domains, such as
precision agriculture, smart cities, and smart manufacturing. IoT domains are
characterized by continuous streams of data originating from diverse,
geographically distributed sensors, and they often require a real-time or
semi-real-time response. IoT characteristics pose several fundamental
challenges to designing and implementing effective ML applications.
Sensor/network failures that result in data stream interruptions is one such
challenge. Unfortunately, the performance of many ML applications quickly
degrades when faced with data incompleteness. Current techniques to handle data
incompleteness are based upon data imputation ( i.e., they try to fill-in
missing data). Unfortunately, these techniques may fail, especially when
multiple sensors' data streams become concurrently unavailable (due to
simultaneous sensor failures). With the aim of building robust IoT-coupled ML
applications, this paper proposes SECOE, a unique, proactive approach for
alleviating potentially simultaneous sensor failures. The fundamental idea
behind SECOE is to create a carefully chosen ensemble of ML models in which
each model is trained assuming a set of failed sensors (i.e., the training set
omits corresponding values). SECOE includes a novel technique to minimize the
number of models in the ensemble by harnessing the correlations among sensors.
We demonstrate the efficacy of the SECOE approach through a series of
experiments involving three distinct datasets. The experimental findings reveal
that SECOE effectively preserves prediction accuracy in the presence of sensor
failures.

merger. The two-dimensional temperature map using XMM-Newton EPIC-PN
observation confirms the existence of a high temperature region, which we call
the ""hot region"", in the ""bridge region"" connecting the two clusters. The ~ 500
kpc wide region between the southeast and northwest boundaries also has higher
pseudo pressure compared to the unshocked regions, suggesting the existence of
two shocks. The southern shock front is clearly visible in the X-ray surface
brightness image and has already been reported by Kato et al. (2015). The
northern one, on the other hand, is newly discovered. To evaluate their Mach
number, we constructed a three-dimensional toy merger model with overlapping
shocked and unshocked components in line of sight. The unshocked and preshock
ICM conditions are estimated based on those outside the interacting bridge
region assuming point symmetry. The hot region spectra are modeled with
two-temperature thermal components, assuming that the shocked condition follows
the Rankin-Hugoniot relation with the preshock condition. As a result, the
shocked region is estimated to have a line-of-sight depth of ~ 1 Mpc with a
Mach number of ~ 1.3 in the southeast shock and ~ 1.7 in the northwest shock.
The age of the shock waves is estimated to be ~ 260 Myr. This three dimensional
merger model is consistent with the Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal obtained using the
Planck observation within the CMB fluctuations. The total flow of the kinetic
energy of the ICM through the southeast shock was estimated to be ~ 2.2 x
$10^{42}$ erg/s. Assuming that 10 % of this energy is converted into ICM
turbulence, the line-of-sight velocity dispersion is calculated to be ~ 200
km/s, which is basically resolvable via coming high spectral resolution
observations.

where CAVs and HDVs share the road, the longitudinal speed control of CAVs can
substantially reduce the energy consumption of the following HDV by avoiding
unnecessary acceleration and braking. Moreover, apart from the objectives

of both CAV and HDV are incorporated into the reward function of reinforcement
learning. The specific driving pattern of the following HDV is learned in
real-time from historical speed information to predict its acceleration and

conducted to statistically verify the positive impacts of CAV on the holistic

SLSNe-I characterized by the presence/absence of a W-shaped absorption feature
in their pre-maximum spectra between 4000 and 5000 \AA (called Type~W and
Type~15bn, respectively). However, the physical cause of this bimodality is
still uncertain. Here we present pre-maximum spectral synthesis of 27 SLSNe-I
with special attention to the photospheric temperature ($T_{ \rm phot}$) and
velocity ($v_{ \rm phot}$) evolution. We find that a $T_{\rm phot}$ limit of
12000~K separates the Type~W and Type~15bn SLSNe-I: Type~W objects tend to show
$T_{\rm phot}\geq$12000~K, while Type~15bn ones have $T_{\rm phot}
\leq$12000~K. This is consistent with the chemical composition of the studied
objects. Another difference between these groups may be found in their ejecta
geometry: Type W SLSNe-I may show null-polarization, implying spherical
symmetry, while the polarization of Type 15bn objects may increase in time.
This suggests a two-component model with a spherical outer carbon-oxygen layer
and an asymmetric inner layer containing heavier ions.
  The two subgroups may have different light curve evolution as well, since 6
Type~W objects show early bumps, unlike Type 15bn SLSNe-I.

non-private learning. This manifests itself in the form of unappealing

direct feedback alignment (DFA), and error modulated Hebbian learning (Hebb),
as well as gated linear networks (GLN). We show that, for each of these
learning rules, the evolution of the output function at infinite width is
governed by a time varying effective neural tangent kernel (eNTK). In the lazy
training limit, this eNTK is static and does not evolve, while in the rich
mean-field regime this kernel's evolution can be determined self-consistently
with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). This DMFT enables comparisons of the
feature and prediction dynamics induced by each of these learning rules. In the
lazy limit, we find that DFA and Hebb can only learn using the last layer
features, while full FA can utilize earlier layers with a scale determined by
the initial correlation between feedforward and feedback weight matrices. In
the rich regime, DFA and FA utilize a temporally evolving and depth-dependent
NTK. Counterintuitively, we find that FA networks trained in the rich regime
exhibit more feature learning if initialized with smaller correlation between
the forward and backward pass weights. GLNs admit a very simple formula for
their lazy limit kernel and preserve conditional Gaussianity of their
preactivations under gating functions. Error modulated Hebb rules show very

reproduce the effects of turbulence at small scales in terms of the resolved
scales, and hence can capture physical effects with less computational
resources. We present a new sub-grid model, the
MHD-instability-induced-turbulence (MInIT) mean-field model. MInIT is a
physically motivated model based on the evolution of the turbulent (Maxwell,
Reynolds, and Faraday) stress tensors and their relation with the turbulent
energy densities of the magneto-rotational (MRI) and parasitic instabilities,
modeled with two partial differential evolution equations with stiff source
terms. Their solution allows obtaining the turbulent stress tensors through the
constant coefficients that link them to the energy densities. The model is
assessed using data from MRI in-box DNS and applying a filtering operation to
compare the filtered data with that from the model. Using the $L_2$-norm as the
metric for the comparison, we find less than one order-of-magnitude difference
between the two sets of data. No dependence on filter size or length scale of
unresolved scales is found, as opposed to results using the gradient model
(which we also use to contrast our model) in which the $L_2$-norm of some of
the stresses increases with filter size. We conclude that MInIT can help DNS by
properly capturing small-scale turbulent stresses which has potential
implications on the dynamics of highly-magnetized rotating compact objects,

Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). However, the
computational complexity for the calculation of the hypervolume scales
unfavorably with increasing number of objectives and data points, which
restricts its use in those common multi-objective optimization frameworks. To
overcome these restrictions we propose to approximate the hypervolume function
with a deep neural network, which we call DeepHV. For better sample efficiency

scale-equivariant in each of the objectives as well as permutation invariant
w.r.t. both the objectives and the samples, by using a deep neural network that

metric representation we find a non-trivial inner product rendering wave
packets of Hartle-Hawking waves normalizable and the time evolution unitary;
however, the implied probability measure differs significantly from the naive
$|\psi|^2$. In contrast with the (monochromatic) Hartle-Hawking wave function,
these packets form travelling waves with a probability peak describing de
Sitter space, except near the bounce, where the incident and reflected waves
interfere, transiently recreating the usual standing wave. Away from the bounce
the packets get sharper both in metric and connection space, an apparent
contradiction with Heisenberg's principle allowed by the fact that the metric
is not Hermitian, even though its eigenvalues are real. Near the bounce, the
evanescent wave not only penetrates into the classically forbidden region but
also extends into the $a^2<0$ Euclidean domain. We work out the propagators for
this theory and relate them to the standard ones. The $a=0$ point (aka the
""nothing"") is unremarkable, and in any case a wave function peaked therein is
typically non-normalizable and/or implies a nonsensical probability for
$\Lambda$ (which the Universe would preserve forever). Within this theory it
makes more sense to adopt a Gaussian state in an appropriate function of
$\Lambda$, and use the probability associated with the evanescent wave present
near the time of the bounce as a measure of the likelihood of creation of a
pair of time-symmetric semiclassical Universes.

living beings on earth, surpassing the weight and size of dinosaurs. In this
paper, we present some empirical evidence and a mathematical model to argue
that fat accumulation in marine mammals triggers a series of metabolic events
that result in these animals' increased size. Our study starts by analysing 43
ontogenetic trajectories of species of different types and sizes. For instance,
the analyses include organisms with asymptotic mass from 27g (Taiwan field
mouse) to $2.10^{7}$g (grey whale). The available data allows us to determine
all available species' ontogenetic parameters (catabolism and anabolism
constant, scaling exponent and asymptotic mass). The analyses of those data
show a minimisation of catabolism and scaling exponent in marine mammals
compared to other species analysed. We present a possible explanation for this,
arguing that the large proportion of adipose tissue in these animals can cause
this minimisation. That is because adipocytes have different scaling properties
in comparison to non-adipose (typical) cells, expressed in reduced energetic
demand and lower metabolism. The conclusion is that when we have an animal with
a relatively large amount of adipose tissue, as is the case of aquatic mammals,
the cellular metabolic rate decreases compared to other animals with the same
mass but with proportionally smaller fat tissue. A final consequence of this
cause-effect process is the increase of the asymptotic mass of these mammals.

multi-periodicity adaptively and extract the complex temporal variations from

design an experiment to characterize the sacral soft tissue motion under a

the discrepancy between tissue motion assessed using a 2D imaging modality
(echography) versus tissue motion assessed using a (reference) 3D imaging
modality (MRI).METHODS: One healthy male volunteer participated in the study.
An MRI-compatible custom-made setup was designed and used to load the top
region of the sacrum with a 3D-printed copy of the US transducer. Five MR
images were collected, one in the unloaded and four in the different loaded
configurations (400-1200 [g]). Then, a 3D displacement field for each loading
configuration was extracted based on the results of digital volume correlation.
Tissue motion was separated into the X, Y, Z directions of the MRI coordinate
system and the ratios between the out-of-plane and in-plane components were
assessed for each voxel of the selected region of interest.RESULTS: Ratios
between the out-of-plane and in-plane displacement components were higher than
0.6 for more than half of the voxels in the region of interest for all load
cases and higher than 1 for at least quarter of the voxels when loads of
400-800 [g] were used.CONCLUSION: The out-of-ultrasound-plane tissue
displacement was not negligible, therefore 2D US imaging should be used with
caution for the evaluation of the tissue motion in the sacrum region. The 3D US
modality should be further investigated for this application.

result, the reduced images do not show any clear H$_{\alpha}$ point source

allows us to derivate Le Cam-type and Fano-type inequalities for both regular

Renyi divergence). We then proceed to illustrate our results on three simple,
fully worked out examples. In particular, we show that the problem class has a
huge importance on the provable degradation of utility due to privacy. For some
problems, privacy leads to a provable degradation only when the rate of the
privacy parameters is small enough whereas for other problem, the degradation
systematically occurs under much looser hypotheses on the privacy parametters.
Finally, we show that the known privacy guarantees of DP-SGLD, a private convex

laminar and turbulent flames. However, the classical MOM is not able to
characterize a continuous particle size distribution (PSD). Without access to
information on the PSD, it is difficult to accurately take into account
particle oxidation, which is crucial for shrinking and eliminating soot
particles. Recently, the Split-based Extended Quadrature Method of Moments
(S-EQMOM) has been proposed as a numerically robust alternative to overcome
this issue (Salenbauch et al., 2019). The main advantage is that a continuous
particle number density function can be reconstructed by superimposing kernel
density functions (KDF). Moreover, the S-EQMOM primary nodes are determined
individually for each KDF, improving the moment realizability.
  In this work, the S-EQMOM is combined with a Large Eddy
Simulation/presumed-PDF flamelet/progress variable approach for predicting soot
formation in the Delft Adelaide Flame III. The target flame features low/high
sooting propensity/intermittency and comprehensive flow/scalar/soot data are
available for model validation. Simulation results are compared with the
experimental data for both the gas phase and the particulate phase. A good
quantitative agreement has been obtained especially in terms of the soot volume
fraction. The reconstructed PSD reveals predominantly unimodal/bimodal
distributions in the first/downstream portion of this flame, with particle
diameters smaller than 100 nm. By investigating the instantaneous and
statistical sooting behavior at the flame tip, it has been found that the
experimentally observed soot intermittency is linked to mixture fraction
fluctuations around its stoichiometric value that exhibit a bimodal probability
density function.

imagery. Comparison to corresponding quantities of the associated magnetic
cloud (MC), deduced from in-situ measurements from Solar Orbiter and near-Earth
spacecraft, allows us to draw conclusions on the evolution of the associated
interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). The latter are aided through the
application of geometric fitting techniques (graduated cylindrical shell
modeling; GCS) and interplanetary propagation models (drag based ensemble
modeling; DBEM) to the ICME. NLFF modeling suggests the host AR's magnetic
structure in the form of a left-handed (negative-helicity) sheared arcade/flux
rope reaching to altitudes of 8-10 Mm above photospheric levels, in close
agreement with the corresponding stereoscopic estimate. Revealed from GCS and
DBEM modeling, the ejected flux rope propagated in a self-similar expanding
manner through interplanetary space. Comparison of magnetic fluxes and
helicities processed by magnetic reconnection in the solar source region and

roadblocks on the way towards widespread deployment of QKD is the high loss
experienced during terrestrial distribution of photons, which limits the
distance between the communicating parties. A viable solution to this problem
is to avoid the terrestrial distribution of photons via optical fibers
altogether and instead transmit them via satellite links, where the loss is
dominated by diffraction instead of absorption and scattering. First dedicated
satellite missions have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, albeit
with relatively low secure key rates. In order for QKD to become commercially
viable, the design of future satellite missions must be focused on achieving
higher key rates at lower system costs. Current satellite missions are already
operating at almost optimal system parameters, which leaves little room for
enhancing the key rates with currently deployed technology. Instead,
fundamentally new techniques are required to drastically reduce the costs per
secret bit shared between two distant parties. Entanglement-based protocols
provide the highest level of security and offer several pathways for increasing
the key rate by exploiting the underlying quantum correlations. In this
contribution, we review the most relevant advances in entanglement-based QKD
which are implementable over free-space links and thus enable distribution of
secure keys from orbit. The development of satellite missions is notoriously
lengthy. Possible candidates for a new generation of quantum payloads should

our main motivation for constructing a means for password harvesting from
keyboard thermal emanations. Specifically, we introduce Thermanator: a new
post-factum insider attack based on heat transfer caused by a user typing a
password on a typical external (plastic) keyboard.
  We conduct and describe a user study that collected thermal residues from 30
users entering 10 unique passwords (both weak and strong) on 4 popular
commodity keyboards. Results show that entire sets of key-presses can be
recovered by non-expert users as late as 30 seconds after initial password
entry, while partial sets can be recovered as late as 1 minute after entry.
However, the thermal residue side-channel lacks information about password
length, duplicate key-presses, and key-press ordering. To overcome these
limitations, we leverage keyboard acoustic emanations and combine the two to
yield AcuTherm, the first hybrid side-channel attack on keyboards. AcuTherm
significantly reduces password search without the need for any training on the
victim's typing. We report results gathered for many representative passwords
based on a user study involving 19 subjects.
  The takeaway of this work is three-fold: (1) using plastic keyboards to enter
secrets (such as passwords and PINs) is even less secure than previously
recognized, (2) post-factum thermal imaging attacks are realistic, and (3)
hybrid (multiple side-channel) attacks are both realistic and effective.

property of multiple access channels, OtA FL enables the users to transmit
their updates simultaneously with linear processing techniques, which improves
resource efficiency. However, this setting is vulnerable to privacy leakage
since an adversary node can hear directly the uncoded message. Traditional
perturbation-based methods provide privacy protection while sacrificing the
training accuracy due to the reduced signal-to-noise ratio. In this work, we
aim at minimizing privacy leakage to the adversary and the degradation of model
accuracy at the edge server at the same time. More explicitly, spatially
correlated perturbations are added to the gradient vectors at the users before
transmission. Using the zero-sum property of the correlated perturbations, the
side effect of the added perturbation on the aggregated gradients at the edge
server can be minimized. In the meanwhile, the added perturbation will not be
canceled out at the adversary, which prevents privacy leakage. Theoretical
analysis of the perturbation covariance matrix, differential privacy, and model
convergence is provided, based on which an optimization problem is formulated
to jointly design the covariance matrix and the power scaling factor to balance
between privacy protection and convergence performance. Simulation results

a quantitative and qualitative analysis using the data extracted from these
studies. Results: Main highlights include: (1) most studies applied supervised
DL; (2) two third of the studies used metrics as an input to DL algorithms; (3)
Convolutional Neural Network is the most frequently used DL algorithm.
Conclusion: Based on our findings, we propose to (1) develop more comprehensive
DL approaches that automatically capture the needed features; (2) use diverse
software artifacts other than source code; (3) adopt data augmentation
techniques to tackle the class imbalance problem; (4) publish replication
packages.

define how to sample pixels based on domain knowledge from medical literature

97% of pixels, such as those that reveal the shape of the thoracic cage, bones,
small lesions and other sensitive features. HeartSpot priors are ante-hoc
explainable and give a human-interpretable image of the preserved spatial
features that clearly outlines the heart. HeartSpot offers strong compression,
with up to 32x fewer pixels and 11x smaller filesize. Cardiomegaly detectors
using HeartSpot are up to 9x faster to train or at least as accurate (up to
+.01 AUC ROC) when compared to a baseline DenseNet121. HeartSpot is post-hoc
explainable by re-using existing attribution methods without requiring access

to design a microstructure optimizing a given mechanical property, e.g.,
maximizing the expected value of shear stress for a given strain. The problem
of finding the optimal discretized shape for a distribution involves a norm

done in a specific way in order to avoid convergence problems. To this end, we
propose a general mathematical approach that can be used to generate trial
solutions uniformly at random while enforcing an Euclidean norm constraint.
Both equality and inequality constraints are considered. A simple technique can
then be used to convert between Euclidean and other Lebesgue $p$-norm (the
1-norm in particular) constrained representations. Considering different
dislocation-precipitate interaction potentials, we demonstrate the convergence
of the algorithm to the optimal solution and discuss its possible extensions to
the more complex and realistic case of three-dimensional dislocation systems

spectral lines is considered to be a good and reliable measurement for electron
density. Unlike intensity based measurements, Stark broadening measurements can
pose a problem of interpretation when the light collected is the result of a
spatial integration. Indeed, when assuming no self-absorption of the emission
lines, intensities simply add up but broadenings do not. In order to better
understand the results of Stark broadening measurements on our thermal plasma
which has an unneglectable thickness, a Python code has been developed based on
local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumption and calculated plasma
composition and properties. This code generates a simulated pseudo experimental
(PE) H$\alpha$ spectral line resulting from an integration over the plasma
thickness in a selected direction for a given temperature profile. The electron
density was obtained using the Stark broadening of the PE spectral line for
different temperature profiles. It resulted that this measurement is governed
by the maximum electron density profile up until the temperature maximum
exceeds that of the maximum electron density. The electron density obtained by

3D trajectory and posture of UAV, fuselage scattering effect (FSE), and posture
variation fading (PVF), are incorporated into the proposed model. The channel
parameters, i.e., path loss (PL), shadow fading (SF), path delay, and path
angle, are generated incorporating machine learning (ML) and ray tracing (RT)
techniques to capture the structure-related characteristics. In order to
guarantee the physical continuity of channel parameters such as Doppler phase
and path power, the time evolution methods of inter- and intra- stationary
intervals are proposed. Key statistical properties , i.e., temporal
autocorrection function (ACF), power delay profile (PDP), level crossing rate
(LCR), average fading duration (AFD), and stationary interval (SI) are given,
and the impact of the change of fuselage and posture variation is analyzed. It
is demonstrated that both posture variation and fuselage scattering have
crucial effects on channel characteristics. The validity and practicability of

response that mitigates the effects of climate change and (c) whether there is
a threshold of defoliation which could be used as an early warning sign for
irreversible damage.
  Results show that environmental drivers leading to tree mortality differ by
species, but some are always required in the model. The defoliation effect on
mortality differs by species but it is always strong and monotonic. There is
some evidence that a defoliation threshold exists for spruce, fir and beech.
  We model tree survival with a smooth additive Cox model allowing for random
effects taking care of dependence between neighbouring trees and non-linear
functions of spatial time varying and functional predictors on defoliation,
climate, soil and hydrology characteristics. Due to the large sample size and
large number of parameters, we use parallel computing combined with marginal

enabling natural language-based interfaces for image generation and

to specific classes of images, and often require fine-tuning to transfer to a
different style or domain. Nevertheless, generic image manipulation using a
single model with flexible text inputs is highly desirable. Recent work
addresses this task by guiding generative models trained on the generic image
datasets using pretrained vision-language encoders. While promising, this
approach requires expensive optimization for each input. In this work, we
propose an optimization-free method for the task of generic image manipulation
from text prompts. Our approach exploits recent Latent Diffusion Models (LDM)
for text to image generation to achieve zero-shot text guided manipulation. We
employ a deterministic forward diffusion in a lower dimensional latent space,
and the desired manipulation is achieved by simply providing the target text to
condition the reverse diffusion process. We refer to our approach as LDEdit. We
demonstrate the applicability of our method on semantic image manipulation and
artistic style transfer. Our method can accomplish image manipulation on
diverse domains and enables editing multiple attributes in a straightforward
fashion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefit of our approach over
competing baselines.

unlabeled images from these various retrieval tasks. This is the more practical
scenario that we consider in this paper. We address it with the proposed
Grappa, an approach that starts from a strong pretrained model, and adapts it
to tackle multiple retrieval tasks concurrently, using only unlabeled images
from the different task domains. We extend the pretrained model with multiple
independently trained sets of adaptors that use pseudo-label sets of different

adaptor sets into a single unified model suited for all retrieval tasks by
learning fusion layers that we guide by propagating pseudo-granularity
attentions across neighbors in the feature space. Results on a benchmark

propagating through the ejecta of a Neutron Star (NS) merger, and a part of the
cocoon escapes the ejecta with an opening angle of $20^{\circ}$--$30^{\circ}$.
Here we model the cocoon and calculate its EM emission. Our 2D hydrodynamic
simulations suggest that the density and energy distributions, after entering
homologous expansion, are well-fitted with power-law functions, in each of the
relativistic and non-relativistic parts of the escaped cocoon. Modeling these
features, we calculate the cooling emission analytically. We find that the
cocoon outshines the r-process kilonova/macronova at early times (10--10$^{3}$

is measurable with instruments such as Swift, ULTRASAT and LSST. We also imply

successes in recent years. A prevailing scheme is to train an autoencoder,
consisting of an encoding network to embed (or transform) secret messages in
(or into) a carrier, and a decoding network to extract the hidden messages.
This scheme may suffer from several limitations regarding practicability,
security, and embedding capacity. In this work, we describe a different
computational framework to hide images in deep probabilistic models.
Specifically, we use a DNN to model the probability density of cover images,
and hide a secret image in one particular location of the learned distribution.
As an instantiation, we adopt a SinGAN, a pyramid of generative adversarial
networks (GANs), to learn the patch distribution of one cover image. We hide
the secret image by fitting a deterministic mapping from a fixed set of noise
maps (generated by an embedding key) to the secret image during patch
distribution learning. The stego SinGAN, behaving as the original SinGAN, is
publicly communicated; only the receiver with the embedding key is able to
extract the secret image. We demonstrate the feasibility of our SinGAN approach
in terms of extraction accuracy and model security. Moreover, we show the
flexibility of the proposed method in terms of hiding multiple images for
different receivers and obfuscating the secret image.

large area detectors (up to some cm$^2$ area) with SiPM array readout, aiming
at high light yields, good energy resolution, good detector linearity and fast
time response for low-energy X-rays. A natural application was found inside the
FAMU project at RIKEN-RAL muon facility, that aims at a precise measure of the
proton Zemach radius to solve the so-called ""proton radius puzzle"", triggered
by the recent measure of the proton charge radius at PSI. The goal is the
detection of characteristic X-rays around 130 keV. Other applications may be
foreseen in medical physics, such as PET, and gamma-ray astronomy. A limiting
factor is the gain drift of SiPM arrays with temperature, that give a
deterioration of the detector's FWHM energy resolution. To solve this problem,
a custom NIM module, based on CAEN A7585 digital power supply, was developed.
Test results of the correction of gain drift with temperature for SiPM arrays
from Advansid, Sensl, Hamamatsu will be presented. At the $^{137}$Cs peak, an
energy resolution better than 3% was obtained for a typical LaBr$_3$:Ce

investigated from experiments with bubbles at large particle Reynolds numbers
and without coalescence. The void fraction field $\varepsilon$ at small scales,
analyzed with Vorono\""i tessellations, corresponds to a Random Poisson Process
(RPP) in homogeneous conditions but it significantly differs from a RPP in the
heterogeneous regime. The distance to a RPP allows identifying meso-scale
structures, namely clusters, void regions and intermediate regions. A series of
arguments demonstrate that the bubble motion is driven by the dynamics of these
structures. Notably, bubbles in clusters (respectively in intermediate regions)
are moving up faster, up to 3.5 (respectively 2) times the terminal velocity,
than bubbles in void regions those absolute velocity equals the mean liquid
velocity. Besides, the mean unconditional relative velocity of bubbles is
recovered from mean relative velocities conditional to meso-scale structures,
weighted by the proportion of bubbles in each structure. Assuming
buoyancy-inertia equilibrium for each structure, the relative velocity is
related with the characteristic size and concentration of meso-scale
structures. By taking the latter quantities values at large gas superficial
velocities, a cartoon of the internal flow structure is proposed. Arguments are
put forward to help understanding why the relative velocity scales as
$(gD\varepsilon)^{1/2}$ (with $D$ the column's diameter and $g$ gravity's
acceleration). The proposed cartoon seems consistent with a fast-track
mechanism that, for the moderate Rouse numbers studied, leads to liquid
velocity fluctuations proportional to the relative velocity. The potential
impact of coalescence on the above analysis is also commented.

that upon interacting with a fundamental breather, a fundamental soliton
becomes a fundamental breather and, conversely, that the interaction of two

polarization shifts, but may also result into a fundamental soliton and a

its chaotic architecture and twistedness, which promotes treatment resistance.
Measurable differences in these attributes may help stratify patients by likely
benefit of systemic therapy (e.g. chemotherapy). In this work, we present a new
category of radiomic biomarkers called quantitative tumor-associated
vasculature (QuanTAV) features, and demonstrate their ability to predict
response and survival across multiple cancers, imaging modalities, and

  Experimental Design: We segmented tumor vessels and computed mathematical
measurements of twistedness and organization on routine pre-treatment radiology
(CT or contrast-enhanced MRI) from 558 patients, who received one of four
first-line chemotherapy-based therapeutic intervention strategies for breast
(n=371) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=187).
  Results: Across 4 chemotherapy-based treatment strategies, classifiers of
QuanTAV measurements significantly (p<.05) predicted response in held out
testing cohorts alone (AUC=0.63-0.71) and increased AUC by 0.06-0.12 when added
to models of significant clinical variables alone. QuanTAV risk scores were
prognostic of recurrence free survival in treatment cohorts chemotherapy for
breast cancer (p=0.002, HR=1.25, 95% CI 1.08-1.44, C-index=.66) and
chemoradiation for NSCLC (p=0.039, HR=1.28, 95% CI 1.01-1.62, C-index=0.66).
Categorical QuanTAV risk groups were independently prognostic among all
treatment groups, including NSCLC patients receiving chemotherapy (p=0.034,
HR=2.29, 95% CI 1.07-4.94, C-index=0.62).
  Conclusions: Across these domains, we observed an association of vascular
morphology on radiology with treatment outcome. Our findings suggest the
potential of tumor-associated vasculature shape and structure as a prognostic
and predictive biomarker for multiple cancers and treatments.

properly. With these updates, it is now possible to process VLBI continuum and
spectral line observations in CASA. This article describes the development and
implementation, and presents an outline for the workflow when calibrating
European VLBI Network or Very Long Baseline Array data in CASA. Though the CASA
VLBI functionality has already been vetted extensively as part of the Event
Horizon Telescope data processing, in this paper we compare results for the
same dataset processed in CASA and AIPS. We find identical results for the two
packages and conclude that CASA in some cases performs better, though it cannot
match AIPS for single-core processing time. The new functionality in CASA
allows for easy development of pipelines or Jupyter notebooks, and thus
contributes to raising VLBI data processing to present day standards for
accessibility, reproducibility, and reusability.

particle ensemble to identify the state that better reproduces the physical
observations, while preserving the physics of the system as described by the
best knowledge model. We consider systems described by parameterized parabolic
partial differential equations and employ model order reduction (MOR)
techniques to generate surrogate models of different accuracy with uncertain

the model bias which constitutes a new source of systematic error. To mitigate
its impact, an algorithm adjustment is proposed accounting for a prior
estimation of the bias in the data. The resulting RB-EnKM is tested in
different conditions, including different ensemble sizes and increasing levels
of experimental noise. The results are compared to those obtained with the

problem (STREE) asks for a set $S\subseteq V(G) \setminus R$ such that the
graph induced on $S\cup R$ is connected. A split graph is a graph which can be
partitioned into a clique and an independent set. It is known that STREE is
NP-complete on split graphs \cite{white1985steiner}. To strengthen this result,
we introduce convex ordering on one of the partitions (clique or independent
set), and prove that STREE is polynomial-time solvable for tree-convex split
graphs with convexity on clique ($K$), whereas STREE is NP-complete on
tree-convex split graphs with convexity on independent set ($I$). We further
strengthen our NP-complete result by establishing a dichotomy which says that
for unary-tree-convex split graphs (path-convex split graphs), STREE is
polynomial-time solvable, and NP-complete for binary-tree-convex split graphs
(comb-convex split graphs). We also show that STREE is polynomial-time solvable
for triad-convex split graphs with convexity on $I$, and circular-convex split
graphs. Further, we show that STREE can be used as a framework for the
dominating set problem (DS) on split graphs, and hence the classical complexity
(P vs NPC) of STREE and DS is the same for all these subclasses of split
graphs. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that in
\cite{CHLEBIK20081264}, it is incorrectly claimed that the problem of finding a
minimum dominating set on split graphs cannot be approximated within
$(1-\epsilon)\ln |V(G)|$ in polynomial-time for any $\epsilon >0$ unless NP
$\subseteq$ DTIME $n^{O(\log \log n)}$. When the input is restricted to split
graphs, we show that the minimum dominating set problem has
$2-\frac{1}{|I|}$-approximation algorithm that runs in polynomial time.

for characterizing the sensing and communication coverage probability and
ergodic capacity in JCAS networks. We employ an information theoretic
formulation of radar tracking to extend the notions of coverage probability and
ergodic capacity to the radar setting. Using this framework, we analyze the
downlink sensing and communication coverage and capacity of a JCAS network
employing a shared multicarrier waveform and analog beamforming. Leveraging
tools from stochastic geometry, we derive upper and lower bounds for these
quantities. We also develop several general technical results including: i) a
method for obtaining closed form bounds on the Laplace Transform of a shot
noise process, ii) an analog of H\""older's Inequality to the setting of
harmonic means, and iii) a relation between the Laplace and Mellin Transforms

by using the Macquart relation which was obtained for 8 localized FRBs, and we

distribution up to the Macquart relation and find that the lognormal form
feature decreases as the uncertainty increases. Moreover, we compare the
luminosity of these apparent non-repeaters with that of the previously observed
10 repeating FRBs also at low DM, noting that they belong to different
lognormal distributions with the mean luminosity of non-repeaters being two
times greater than that of repeaters. Therefore, from the two different

generate the image? For instance, human creation is more inclined to the
outline-to-fine of an image, while VQ-AR models themselves do not consider any
relative importance of image patches. In this paper, we present a progressive
model for high-fidelity text-to-image generation. The proposed method takes
effect by creating new image tokens from coarse to fine based on the existing
context in a parallel manner, and this procedure is recursively applied with
the proposed error revision mechanism until an image sequence is completed. The
resulting coarse-to-fine hierarchy makes the image generation process intuitive

particular, we show the following trichotomy: for any concept class, the
optimal learning rate is either exponential, linear or arbitrarily slow.
Additionally, we provide complexity measures of the underlying hypothesis class
that characterize when these rates occur. Second, we consider the problem of
multiclass classification with structured data (such as data lying on a low
dimensional manifold or satisfying margin conditions), a setting which is
captured by partial concept classes (Alon, Hanneke, Holzman and Moran, FOCS

Then our improved hybrid deep deterministic policy gradient (HDDPG) and

effectiveness of the proposed Neuro-Planner, we carry out detailed comparison

consistent with stellar population synthesis models. We solve the spherical
Jeans equation that includes the Yukawa-like gravitational potential appearing
in the weak field limit of $f(R)$ gravity, and a Plummer density profile for
the stellar distribution. The $f(R)$ velocity dispersion profiles depend on two
parameters: the scale length $\xi^{-1}$, below which the Yukawa term is
negligible, and the boost of the gravitational field $\delta>-1$. $\delta$ and
$\xi$ are not universal parameters, but their variation within the same class
of objects is expected to be limited. The $f(R)$ velocity dispersion profiles
fit the data with a value $\xi^{-1}= 1.2^{+18.6}_{-0.9}$ Mpc for the entire
galaxy sample. On the contrary, the values of $\delta$ show a bimodal
distribution that picks at $\bar{\delta}=-0.986\pm0.002$ and

a severe tension for $f(R)$ gravity. It remains to be seen whether an improved

motions of stars measured by future astrometric space missions can return
consistent $\delta$'s for the entire sample and remove this tension.

radiative and accretion processes of supermassive black holes (BHs) in high-$z$
quasars. Although the QLF shape has been constrained by recent observations, it
remains challenging to develop a theoretical model that explains its redshift
evolution associated with BH growth self-consistently. In this study, based on
a semi-analytical model for the BH formation and growth, we construct the QLF
and BHMF of the early BH population that experiences multiple accretion bursts,
in each of which a constant Eddington ratio is assigned following a Schechter
distribution function. Our best-fit model to reproduce the observed QLF and
BHMF at $z\simeq 6$ suggests that several episodes of moderate super-Eddington
accretion occur and each of them lasts for $\tau \simeq 20-30$ Myr. The average
duty cycle in super-Eddington phases is $\simeq 15\%$ for massive BHs that
reach $\gtrsim 10^8~M_\odot$ by $z\simeq 6$, which is nearly twice that of the
entire population. We also find that the observed Eddington-ratio distribution
function is skewed to a log-normal shape owing to detection limits of quasar
surveys. The predicted redshift evolution of the QLF and BHMF suggests a rapid
decay of their number and mass density in a cosmic volume toward $z\gtrsim 6$.
These results will be unveiled by future deep and wide surveys with the James

multi-stream intermediate fusion framework enabling incorporation of an
additional guidance information stream that best matches the domain of the

The state of neutrino can be exactly inferred by measuring the state of

this rare decay mode has not yet been observed so far since it was predicted in
1947. The challenge in observing this decay is not only that its cross section
is extremely low, equivalent to about branching ratio of the order of $10^{-6}$
of the three-body decay, but also that the final-state hydrogen atom is neutral
and has extremely low kinetic energy, which cannot be effectively detected. In
this study, we propose a microcalorimeter-based scheme for measuring the
kinetic energies of hydrogen atoms produced from BoB of ultracold neutrons,
which has a great advantage in terms of accuracy of the energy measurement. In
this study, first, several important issues that require rigorous

Then, the requirements of the neutron flux and the appropriate structure design

different computers simultaneously: a resource-limited local computer tethered
to the robot and a powerful remote computer connected wirelessly. Given such a
setup, it is unclear to what extent the performance of a learning system can be
affected by resource limitations and how to efficiently use the wirelessly
connected powerful computer to compensate for any performance loss. In this
paper, we implement a real-time learning system called the Remote-Local
Distributed (ReLoD) system to distribute computations of two deep reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), between a local and a remote computer. The performance of
the system is evaluated on two vision-based control tasks developed using a
robotic arm and a mobile robot. Our results show that SAC's performance
degrades heavily on a resource-limited local computer. Strikingly, when all
computations of the learning system are deployed on a remote workstation, SAC
fails to compensate for the performance loss, indicating that, without careful
consideration, using a powerful remote computer may not result in performance
improvement. However, a carefully chosen distribution of computations of SAC
consistently and substantially improves its performance on both tasks. On the
other hand, the performance of PPO remains largely unaffected by the
distribution of computations. In addition, when all computations happen solely
on a powerful tethered computer, the performance of our system remains on par
with an existing system that is well-tuned for using a single machine. ReLoD is
the only publicly available system for real-time RL that applies to multiple

paradigmatic settings, e.g. in the $t-J$ and $t-J_z$ Hamiltonians. Even there,
the most basic properties of paired states of only two dopants, such as their

pairing mechanism of mobile holes in an antiferromagnet. We analyze an

spectral properties of bound states. Our model is equally relevant for
understanding Hubbard-Mott excitons consisting of a bound doublon-hole pair or
confined states of dynamical matter in lattice gauge theories, which motivates
our study of different parton statistics. Although an accurate semi-analytic

factors underlying the colossal failure of existing unsupervised models on

of spinmerism as an extension of mesomerism to spin degrees of freedom. The
construction of localized molecular orbitals allows for a reading of the
wavefunctions and projections onto the local spin states. The low-energy

the higher-lying $S_{total} = 2$ states are superpositions of the local $S_{Fe}

the traditional picture of a high-field $d^6$ Tanabe-Sugano diagram. Even in
the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the avoided crossing between different

puzzling scenario emerges from versatile local spin states in compounds which

rules behind different augmentations? If so, what are they and what insights

symmetric keys between a pair of wireless communication users in a
plug-and-play manner. The shared entropy source almost entirely comes from the
intrinsic randomness of the radio channel, which is highly dependent on the
wireless environment. However, in some static wireless environments, the
intrinsic randomness of wireless channel is hard to be guaranteed. Very
recently, thanks to reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with their
excellent ability on electromagnetic wave control, the wireless channel
environment can be customized. In this article, we overview the RIS-aided PLKG
in a static indoor environment, including its potential application scenarios,
channel model and hardware architectures. Then, we analyze the design
challenges of RIS-aided PLKG, including channel reciprocity, RIS switch speed
and RIS deployment via proof-of-concept experiments on a RIS-aided PLKG
prototype system. In particular, our experimental results show that the key
generation rate is 15-fold higher than that without RIS in a static indoor
environment. Next, we design a RIS flip attack via a prototype experiment and
discuss its possible attack-defense countermeasures. Finally, several
conclusions and future directions are identified.

habitability in the next few billion years. If life exists elsewhere in the
Universe, the aging of its host star similarly poses an existential threat. One
solution, which we dub a Lazarus star, is for an advanced civilization to
remove (or star-lift) mass from their host star at a rate that offsets the
increase in luminosity, keeping the flux on the habitable planet(s) constant
and extending the lifetime of their star. While this idea has existed since
1985 when it was first proposed by Criswell, numerical investigations of
star-lifting have been lacking. Here, we use the stellar evolution code MESA to
find mass vs. age and $\dot{M}$ vs. age relations which would hold the flux on
surrounding planets constant. We explore initial mass ranging from $0.2{\rm
M}_{\odot}$ to $1.2{\rm M}_{\odot}$. For most stars with a mass initially below
about $ 0.4 {\rm M}_{\odot}$, we find that star-lifting increases their
main-sequence lifetimes up to $500$ Gyr until they approach the hydrogen
burning limit and star-lifting is no longer possible. For more massive stars,
star-lifting increase main-sequence lifetimes by 1 Gyr to 100 Gyr, though they
still enter the red-giant phase. For example, a Sun-like star has a
main-sequence lifetime which can be increased by up to 3 Gyr. This requires a
mass-loss rate of about $0.05 {\rm M}_{\mathrm{Ceres}}$ per year. We compare
star-lifting to other survival strategies and briefly discuss methods for
detecting these engineered stars.

learning model to predict gridded three-dimensional representations of the
particle density and velocity fields, given as input the corresponding fluid

clustered particles in a highly non-linear regime. We assess model fidelity by
calculating metrics of the density structure (the radial distribution function)
and of the velocity field (the relative velocity and the relative radial

where $L$ is the length of the nonlinear medium and $\Delta k$ the phase
mismatch between the pump and down-converted fields. In theoretical
investigations, the \textit{sinc} behavior of the phase mismatch has often been
approximated by a Gaussian function $\exp{(-\alpha x^2)}$ in order to derive
analytical expressions for the SPDC process. Different values have been chosen
in the literature for the optimization factor $\alpha$, for instance by
comparing the widths of \textit{sinc} and Gaussian functions or the momentum of

different theoretical predictions for the same setup. Therefore, an informed

introduce a distributed Gibbs sampler to efficiently solve such problems,
considering posterior distributions with multiple smooth and non-smooth

to split the primal and dual variables into blocks, leading to a distributed
block-coordinate Gibbs sampler. The resulting algorithm exploits the hypergraph
structure of the involved linear operators to efficiently distribute the
variables over multiple workers under controlled communication costs. It
accommodates several distributed architectures, such as the Single Program

evidence of the reversible control of the metal-to-insulator phase transition

low energy Terahertz cavities. We reveal that, while long wavelength cavities
(up to ~ 25 GHz) favour the metallic phase, the coupling with cavities at
higher frequencies results in a stabilization of the insulating charge density
wave phase. Overall, for the present setting the measured critical temperature
associated to the metal-to-insulator transition in 1T-TaS$_{2}$ can be shifted
by more than 70 K by tuning the cavity resonant frequency. Such a giant

reversible touchless control of the metal-to-insulator phase transition. A
switch between conductive and insulating behaviour is obtained by mechanically
tuning the distance between the cavity mirrors and their alignment. Our finding

Specifically, instead of simultaneously attacking all geo-distributed data

identify the time-dependent set of victim nodes. Furthermore, we devise a
spatiotemporal gradient descent based scheme to generate real-valued
adversarial traffic states under a perturbation constraint. Meanwhile, we
theoretically demonstrate the worst performance bound of adversarial traffic

the proposed two-step framework achieves up to $67.8\%$ performance degradation

load into dimensionless trends and local fluctuations, which realizes the
utilization of domain knowledge, captures the long-term dependency of the load

Cross-validation experiments on different districts show that TgDLF2.0 is
approximately 16% more accurate than TgDLF and saves more than half of the

methods are one class of the unsupervised approaches that are achieving

unsupervised Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based anomaly detection
framework, DEGAN. It relies solely on normal time series data as input to train
a well-configured discriminator (D) into a standalone anomaly predictor. In
this framework, time series data is processed by the sliding window method.
Expected normal patterns in data are leveraged to develop a generator (G)
capable of generating normal data patterns. Normal data is also utilized in
hyperparameter tuning and D model selection steps. Validated D models are then
extracted and applied to evaluate unseen (testing) time series and identify
patterns that have anomalous characteristics. Kernel density estimation (KDE)
is applied to data points that are likely to be anomalous to generate
probability density functions on the testing time series. The segments with the
highest relative probabilities are detected as anomalies. To evaluate the
performance, we tested on univariate acceleration time series for five miles of
a Class I railroad track. We implemented the framework to detect the real
anomalous observations identified by operators. The results show that
leveraging the framework with a CNN D architecture results in average best
recall and precision of 80% and 86%, respectively, which demonstrates that a
well-trained standalone D model has the potential to be a reliable anomaly
detector. Moreover, the influence of GAN hyperparameters, GAN architectures,
sliding window sizes, clustering of time series, and model validation with

strategy based on auxiliary variable reformulation allows us to optimize
pointwise map smoothness alongside desirable functional map properties such as
bijectivity. This leads to an efficient map refinement strategy that
simultaneously improves functional and point-to-point correspondences,
obtaining smooth maps even on non-isometric shape pairs. Moreover, we
demonstrate that several previously proposed methods for computing smooth maps

relationship between antibody sequence and activity is a complex physical
process and traditional iterative design approaches rely on large scale assays

difficult to deploy SSL on a new dataset for which no labels can help to judge
the quality of the learned representation. In this study, we develop a simple

friendly, this method -- coined RankMe -- allows one to assess the performance
of JE-SSL representations, even on different downstream datasets, without
requiring any labels. A further benefit of RankMe is that it does not have any

it a real wave, or it is only a mathematical tool for calculating probabilities
of results of measurements? Different interpretations of the quantum mechanics
(QM) assume different answers to this question. It is shown in this article
that the assumption that the wave function is a real wave entails a
contradiction with the predictions of the QM, when the special relativity is
invoked. Therefore, this text concentrates on interpretations which conjecture
that the reality that moves in our apparatuses is particles, and they move
under the constraints of the wave function. The de Broglie Bohm interpretation,
which matches this picture, assumes that the particle travels along a
continuous trajectory. However, the idea of continuous trajectories was proved
to lead to a contradiction with the quantum predictions. Therefore this
interpretation is not considered here. S. Gao conjectured that the particle is
in a permanent random and discontinuous motion (RDM). As it jumps all the time
from place to place, the total set of occupied positions at a certain time is
given by the absolute square of the wave function. As motivation for his idea,
Gao argued that if a charged particle were simultaneously in two or more
locations at the same time, the copies of the particle would repel one another,
destroying the wave function. It is proved here that the quantum formalism
renders this motivation wrong. Although refuting this motivation, the RDM
interpretation is examined here. A couple of problems of this interpretation
are examined and it is proved that they do not lead to any observable
contradictions with the QM predictions, except one problem which seems to have
no solution. In all, it appears that none of the wide-spread interpretations of
the QM is free of contradictions.

important that game developers have access to crowd simulation tools that are
both powerful and easy to use. In this paper, we present WebCrowds, an
authoring tool for crowd simulation which can be used by anyone to build
environments and simulate the movement of agents. The results achieved by our
research suggest that WebCrowds is easy to use, delivers trustworthy simulation
results, and can be used as an authoring tool for game developers who need to
simulate crowds in their games.

activity, is an important method for identifying cardiovascular disease.
However, analyzing the increasing quantity of ECG data consumes a lot of
medical resources. This paper explores an effective algorithm for automatic
classifications of multi-classes of heartbeat types based on ECG. Most neural
network based methods target the individual heartbeats, ignoring the secrets
embedded in the temporal sequence. And the ECG signal has temporal variation
and unique individual characteristics, which means that the same type of ECG
signal varies among patients under different physical conditions. A two-stream
architecture is used in this paper and presents an enhanced version of ECG
recognition based on this. The architecture achieves classification of holistic
ECG signal and individual heartbeat and incorporates identified and temporal
stream networks. Identified networks are used to extract features of individual
heartbeats, while temporal networks aim to extract temporal correlations
between heartbeats. Results on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm performs an accuracy of 99.38\%. In addition, the
proposed algorithm reaches an 88.07\% positive accuracy on massive data in real

high-speed and ultra-low-power optical neural networks (ONNs). Most optical
systems suffer from the misalignment of the optical devices during installment.
The performance of ONN based on the optical 4f system (4f-ONN) is considered
sensitive to the misalignment in the optical path introduced. In order to
comprehensively investigate the influence caused by the misalignment, we
proposed a method for estimating the performance of a 4f-ONN in response to
various misalignment in the context of the image classification task.The
misalignment in numerical simulation is estimated by manipulating the optical
intensity distributions in the fourth focus plane in the 4f system. Followed by
a series of physical experiments to validate the simulation results. Using our
method to test the impact of misalignment of 4f system on the classification
accuracy of two popular image classification datasets, MNIST and Quickdraw16.
On both datasets, we found that the performances of 4f-ONN generally degraded
dramatically as the positioning error increased. Different positioning error
tolerance in the misalignment orientations was observed over the two datasets.
Classification performance could be preserved by positioning errors up to 200
microns in a specific direction.

their utility impractical for indoor and urban applications. On the other hand,
Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) is gaining popularity as a practical alternative
for GNSS/INS systems in GPS-denied environments. Among the many VIO-based
methods, the Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF) has received a
greater attention due to its robustness, speed and accuracy. To this end, the
high computational cost associated with image processing for real-time
implementation of MSCKF on resource-constrained vehicles is still a challenging
ongoing research. In this paper, an enhanced version of the MSCKF is proposed.
To this aim, different feature marginalization and state pruning strategies are
suggested that result in a much faster algorithm. The proposed algorithm is
tested both on an open-source dataset and in real-world experiments for
validation. It is demonstrated that the proposed Fast-MSCKF (FMSCKF) is about

reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Hence, it is expected that HAPS will
support numerous applications in both rural and urban areas. However, this
comes at the expense of high energy consumption and thus shorter loitering
time. To tackle this issue, we envision the use of a multi-mode HAPS that can
adaptively switch between different modes so as to reduce energy consumption
and extend the HAPS loitering time. These modes comprise a HAPS super macro
base station (HAPS-SMBS) mode for enhanced computing, caching, and
communication services, a HAPS relay station (HAPS-RS) mode for active
communication, and a HAPS-RIS mode for passive communication. This multimode
HAPS ensures that operations rely mostly on the passive communication payload,
while switching to an energy-greedy active mode only when necessary. In this
article, we begin with a brief review of HAPS features compared to other
non-terrestrial systems, followed by an exposition of the different HAPS modes
proposed. Subsequently, we illustrate the envisioned multi-mode HAPS, and
discuss its benefits and challenges. Finally, we validate the multi-mode

building blocks that hold together solely through contact and friction at the
blocks' interfaces, and thus do not require any connective elements. This
salient feature makes them highly energy-absorbing, resistant to crack
propagation, geometrically versatile, and re-usable. It also gives rise to
failure mechanisms that, differently from ordinary structures, are governed by
multiple contact interactions between blocks and frictional slip at their
interfaces. Commonly-used modeling tools for structural analysis severely
struggle to capture and quantify these unusual failure mechanisms. Here, we
propose a different approach that is well suited to model the complex failure
of TIS. It is based on the Level-Set-Discrete-Element-Method, originally
developed for granular mechanics applications. After introducing the basic
assumptions and theoretical concepts underlying our model, we show that it
well-captures experimentally observed slip-governed failure in TIS slabs and
that it estimates the force-displacement curves better than presently available
modeling tools. The theoretical foundation together with the results of this

potential to improve our ability to model and to understand the behavior of
