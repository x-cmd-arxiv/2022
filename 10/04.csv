important applications for robotics, augmented reality and digital content
creation. Often this is done through direct mesh predictions which produces
unrealistic, overly tessellated shapes or by formulating shape prediction as a
retrieval task followed by CAD model alignment. Directly predicting CAD model
poses from 2D image features is difficult and inaccurate. Some works, such as
ROCA, regress normalised object coordinates and use those for computing poses.
While this can produce more accurate pose estimates, predicting normalised
object coordinates is susceptible to systematic failure. Leveraging efficient
transformer architectures we demonstrate that a sparse, iterative,
render-and-compare approach is more accurate and robust than relying on
normalised object coordinates. For this we combine 2D image information
including sparse depth and surface normal values which we estimate directly
from the image with 3D CAD model information in early fusion. In particular, we
reproject points sampled from the CAD model in an initial, random pose and
compute their depth and surface normal values. This combined information is the
input to a pose prediction network, SPARC-Net which we train to predict a 9 DoF
CAD model pose update. The CAD model is reprojected again and the next pose
update is predicted. Our alignment procedure converges after just 3 iterations,
improving the state-of-the-art performance on the challenging real-world
dataset ScanNet from 25.0% to 31.8% instance alignment accuracy. Code will be

parameterized by $f_{\rm NL}$, induce a scale-dependence in the large-scale
bias of halos in the late Universe. This effect is a promising path to
constrain multi-field inflation theories that predict non-zero $f_{\rm NL}$.
While most existing constraints from the halo bias involve auto-correlations of
the galaxy distribution, cross-correlations with probes of the matter density
provide an alternative channel with fewer systematics. We present the strongest
large-scale structure constraint on local primordial non-Gaussianity that uses
cross-correlations alone. We use the cosmic infrared background (CIB)
consisting of dusty galaxies as a halo tracer and cosmic microwave background
(CMB) lensing as a probe of the underlying matter distribution, both from
\textit{Planck} data. Milky Way dust is a key challenge in using the
large-scale modes of the CIB. Importantly, the cross-correlation of the CIB
with CMB lensing is far less affected by Galactic dust compared to the CIB
auto-spectrum, which picks up an additive bias from Galactic dust. We find no
evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity and find $-87<f_{\rm NL}<19$ with a
Gaussian $\sigma(f_{\rm NL})\approx 41$, assuming universality of the halo mass
function. We find that future CMB lensing data from Simons Observatory and
CMB-S4 could achieve $\sigma(f_{\rm NL})$ of 23 and 20 respectively. The
constraining power of such an analysis is limited by current Galactic dust
cleaning techniques, requiring us to use a minimum multipole of $\ell=70$. If
this challenge is overcome with improved analysis techniques or external data,
constraints as tight as $\sigma(f_{\rm NL})=4$ can be achieved through the
cross-correlation technique. More optimistically, constraints better than
$\sigma(f_{\rm NL})=2$ could be achieved if the CIB auto-spectrum is dust-free
down to the largest scales.

algorithms in the MARL setting present significant challenges, which

paper, we focus on the most basic setting of competitive multi-agent RL, namely
two-player zero-sum Markov games, and study equilibrium finding algorithms in
both the infinite-horizon discounted setting and the finite-horizon episodic
setting. We propose a single-loop policy optimization method with symmetric
updates from both agents, where the policy is updated via the
entropy-regularized optimistic multiplicative weights update (OMWU) method and
the value is updated on a slower timescale. We show that, in the
full-information tabular setting, the proposed method achieves a finite-time
last-iterate linear convergence to the quantal response equilibrium of the
regularized problem, which translates to a sublinear last-iterate convergence
to the Nash equilibrium by controlling the amount of regularization. Our
convergence results improve upon the best known iteration complexities, and
lead to a better understanding of policy optimization in competitive Markov

galaxies into three main categories: simple, stretched, and twisted. These
categories are based on the radial reorientation of the principal axes of the
reduced inertia tensor. We find that the vast majority ($76\%$) of galaxies in
our sample exhibit twisting patterns in their radial profiles. Additionally, we
present detailed comparisons between 1) the gaseous distributions belonging to
individual temperature regimes, 2) the cold gas distributions and stellar
distributions, and 3) the gaseous distributions and dark matter (DM) halos. We
find a strong correlation between the morphological properties of the cold gas

distributions with DM halo which increases with gas temperature, implying that
we may use the gaseous morphology as a tracer to probe the DM morphology.
Finally, we show gaseous distributions exhibit significantly more prolate
morphologies than the stellar distributions and DM halos, which we hypothesize

coefficient, and the orthogonality score to evaluate the parsimony and

of symmetric incoming quasiparticle beams, conventional fermions result in a

  We analyse these theories by extending the description of CFT correlators via
three-dimensional topological field theory developed in [arXiv:hep-th/0204148]
to include parity and spin. In each of the four cases, the defining data are a
special Frobenius algebra $F$ in a suitable ribbon fusion category, such that
the Nakayama automorphism of $F$ is the identity (oriented case) or squares to
the identity (spin case). We use the TFT to define correlators in terms of $F$

conditions.
  We allow for world sheets with boundaries and topological line defects, and
we specify the categories of boundary labels and the fusion categories of line
defect labels for each of the four types.
  The construction can be understood in terms of topological line defects as
gauging a possibly non-invertible symmetry. We analyse the case of a

problems, including how to protect astronauts against the devastating effects

environment on Mars is of particular interest, since maintaining optimal
absorbed doses by astronauts is crucial to their survival. Here, we give an
overview of the conditions on Mars, as determined by theoretical models and
in-situ measurements, and present the main proposed strategies to mitigate
radiation exposure while on Mars. Specifically, we focus on the passive
shielding technique. Several widely used materials, along with some innovative
ones and combinations of those, are studied for their behavior against Solar
Energetic Particle Events and Galactic Cosmic Rays in the Martian environment.
For that purpose, we implement the GEANT4 package, a Monte-Carlo numerical

of radiation with matter. A description of our model will be given, followed by
outputs of the numerical model. We conclude that hydrogen-rich materials act as
better attenuators, as expected, but other materials can be helpful against

gradients provide the fuel that feeds dynamical processes that sustain life.
Dynamical flows in respective environments incur losses manifested as entropy
production. In this work we consider a rudimentary model of an overdamped
stochastic thermodynamic system in an anisotropic temperature heat bath, and
analyze the problem to minimize entropy production while driving the system
between thermodynamic states in finite time. It is noted that entropy
production in a fully isotropic temperature field, can be expressed as the
Wasserstein-2 length of the path traversed by the thermodynamic state of the
system. In the presence of an anisotropic temperature field, the mechanism of
entropy production is substantially more complicated as, besides dissipation,
it entails seepage of energy between the ambient heat sources by way of the
system dynamics. We show that, in this case, the entropy production can be
expressed as the solution of a suitably constrained and generalized Optimal
Mass Transport (OMT) problem. In contrast to the situation in standard OMT,
entropy production may not be identically zero, even when the thermodynamic
state remains unchanged. Physically, this is due to the fact that maintaining a
Non-Equilibrium Steady State (NESS), incurs an intrinsic entropic cost. As
already noted, NESSs are the hallmark of life and living systems by necessity
operate away from equilibrium. Thus our problem of minimizing entropy
production appears of central importance in understanding biological processes,
such as molecular motors and motor proteins, and on how such processes may have
evolved to optimize for available usage of resources.

algorithmic stability and generalization error in different forms and give a
high probability generalization bound which improves the previous best one from
$\bigO(\sqrt{n})$ to $\bigO(\log n)$, where $n$ is the sample size. We then
provide the first stability bounds for the general case where both inner and

allows only the outer level parameter to be updated. Our analysis can be

leveraged in free space and fiber optics. Non-reciprocal polarization rotation,
enabled via the magneto-optic Faraday effect, has been essentially unbeatable
for broadband isolators and circulators. For integrated photonics foundries,
however, there is still no good path to producing low-loss magneto-optic
components, which has prompted a search for alternatives that do not use
polarization rotation. Moreover, magneto-optic materials tend to be highly
lossy, and while large (10-100 rad/cm) polarization rotation can be achieved,
the key figure of merit (rotation-per-loss) is typically < 1 rad/dB. Here, we
demonstrate that broadband non-reciprocal polarization rotation can be produced
using electro-optics in nanophotonic devices. Our demonstration leverages
electro-optic inter-polarization scattering around 780 nm in lithium niobate,
in which the reciprocity is broken with the help of a radiofrequency stimulus

polarization rotation rate is approximately 1 rad/cm, the exceptionally low

capturing local or multi-scale features from input images. A deep CNN is often
required to indirectly extract global features, which are critical to describe
the images converted from multivariate dynamical data. This paper proposes a
novel local-global CNN (LG-CNN) architecture that directly accounts for both
local and global features for fault diagnosis. Specifically, the local features
are acquired by traditional local kernels whereas global features are extracted
by using 1D tall and fat kernels that span the entire height and width of the
image. Both local and global features are then merged for classification using
fully-connected layers. The proposed LG-CNN is validated on the benchmark
Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) dataset. Comparison with traditional CNN shows
that the proposed LG-CNN can greatly improve the fault diagnosis performance
without significantly increasing the model complexity. This is attributed to
the much wider local receptive field created by the LG-CNN than that by CNN.
The proposed LG-CNN architecture can be easily extended to other image

While numerous anomaly detection methods have been proposed in the literature,

available in practice. The practical problem of selecting the most accurate
model for a given dataset without labels has received little attention in the
literature. This paper answers this question i.e. Given an unlabeled dataset
and a set of candidate anomaly detectors, how can we select the most accurate

metrics, namely, prediction error, model centrality, and performance on
injected synthetic anomalies, and show that some metrics are highly correlated
with standard supervised anomaly detection performance metrics such as the
$F_1$ score, but to varying degrees. We formulate metric combination with
multiple imperfect surrogate metrics as a robust rank aggregation problem. We
then provide theoretical justification behind the proposed approach.
Large-scale experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our

solutions may converge to a characteristic function or to a positive solution
of a limit nonlinear problem in terms of the logarithmic Laplacian, that is,
the pseudodifferential operator with Fourier symbol $\ln(|\xi|^2)$. In the case
of a logistic-type nonlinearity, our results have the following biological
interpretation: in the presence of a toxic boundary, species with reduced
mobility have a lower saturation threshold, higher survival rate, and are more
homogeneously distributed. As a result of independent interest, we show that
sublinear logarithmic problems have a unique least-energy solution, which is
bounded and Dini continuous with a log-H\""older modulus of continuity.

Shift problem where, differently from the ML standard hypothesis, the data in
the training and test sets can follow different probability distributions,
leading ML systems toward poor generalisation performances. This problem is
intensely felt in the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) context, where bio-signals
as Electroencephalographic (EEG) are often used. In fact, EEG signals are
highly non-stationary both over time and between different subjects. To
overcome this problem, several proposed solutions are based on recent transfer
learning approaches such as Domain Adaption (DA). In several cases, however,
the actual causes of the improvements remain ambiguous. This paper focuses on
the impact of data normalisation, or standardisation strategies applied
together with DA methods. In particular, using \textit{SEED}, \textit{DEAP},
and \textit{BCI Competition IV 2a} EEG datasets, we experimentally evaluated
the impact of different normalization strategies applied with and without
several well-known DA methods, comparing the obtained performances. It results
that the choice of the normalisation strategy plays a key role on the
classifier performances in DA scenarios, and interestingly, in several cases,
the use of only an appropriate normalisation schema outperforms the DA
technique.

discussed within the semiclassical picture. Applying the fermionic truncated
Wigner approximation (fTWA), the dynamics of imbalances for charge and spin
degrees of freedom is analyzed and its time evolution is compared with the
exact simulations in one-dimensional lattice. Quench from charge or spin
density wave is considered. We show that introduction of harmonic and
spin-dependent linear potentials sufficiently validates fTWA for longer times.
Such an improvement of fTWA is also obtained for the higher order correlations
in terms of quantum Fisher information for charge and spin channels. This
allows us to discuss the dynamics of larger system sizes and connect our
discussion to the recently introduced Stark many-body localization. In
particular, we focus on a finite two-dimensional system and show that at
intermediate linear potential strength, the addition of a harmonic potential
and spin dependence of the tilt, results in subdiffusive dynamics, similar to
that of disordered systems. Moreover, for specific values of harmonic
potential, we observed phase separation of ergodic and non-ergodic regions in
real space. The latter fact is especially important for ultracold atom
experiments in which harmonic confinement can be easily imposed, causing a
significant change in relaxation times for different lattice locations.

Popular inertial navigation methods for underwater localization using
Doppler-velocity log sensors, sonar, high-end inertial navigation systems, or
acoustic positioning systems require bulky expensive hardware which are
incompatible with low cost, bio-inspired underwater robots. In this paper, we
introduce an approach for underwater robot localization inspired by GPS methods
known as acoustic pseudoranging. Our method allows us to potentially localize
multiple bio-inspired robots equipped with commonly available micro
electro-mechanical systems microphones. This is achieved through estimating the
time difference of arrival of acoustic signals sent simultaneously through four
speakers with a known constellation geometry. We also leverage the same
acoustic framework to perform oneway communication with the robot to execute
some primitive motions. To our knowledge, this is the first application of the
approach for the on-board localization of small bio-inspired robots in water.

collisional scattering dominates the heat transport at lower levels in the loop

Temperature profiles and their corresponding differential emission measure

well-known excess of differential emission measure at relatively low

Additionally, we explore structural and quantitative morphology measurements

dominated by irregular and peculiar structures, either visually or
quantitatively, as previously thought. We find a strong dominance of
morphologically selected disk galaxies up to $z = 8$, a far higher redshift

  Adversarial Examples","Accepted by NeurIPS 2022",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Multi-label classification, which predicts a set of labels for an input, has
many applications. However, multiple recent studies showed that multi-label
classification is vulnerable to adversarial examples. In particular, an
attacker can manipulate the labels predicted by a multi-label classifier for an
input via adding carefully crafted, human-imperceptible perturbation to it.
Existing provable defenses for multi-class classification achieve sub-optimal
provable robustness guarantees when generalized to multi-label classification.
In this work, we propose MultiGuard, the first provably robust defense against
adversarial examples to multi-label classification. Our MultiGuard leverages
randomized smoothing, which is the state-of-the-art technique to build provably
robust classifiers. Specifically, given an arbitrary multi-label classifier,
our MultiGuard builds a smoothed multi-label classifier via adding random noise
to the input. We consider isotropic Gaussian noise in this work. Our major
theoretical contribution is that we show a certain number of ground truth
labels of an input are provably in the set of labels predicted by our
MultiGuard when the $\ell_2$-norm of the adversarial perturbation added to the
input is bounded. Moreover, we design an algorithm to compute our provable
robustness guarantees. Empirically, we evaluate our MultiGuard on VOC 2007,
MS-COCO, and NUS-WIDE benchmark datasets. Our code is available at:

that the resistive field plays a significant role in the early-stage

accelerated due to the resistive electric field when they cross an X-point,
created during the fragmentation of the current sheet. If this preliminary

the conclusion that the resistive field is not only non-negligible but it does

adapting V&L models to a downstream task using a few training examples.
However, current methods significantly overfit the training data, suffering
from large accuracy degradation when tested on unseen classes from the same
domain. To this end, in this paper, we make the following 4 contributions: (1)
To alleviate base class overfitting, we propose a novel Language-Aware Soft
Prompting (LASP) learning method by means of a text-to-text cross-entropy loss
that maximizes the probability of the learned prompts to be correctly
classified with respect to pre-defined hand-crafted textual prompts. (2) To
increase the representation capacity of the prompts, we propose grouped LASP
where each group of prompts is optimized with respect to a separate subset of
textual prompts. (3) We identify a visual-language misalignment introduced by
prompt learning and LASP, and more importantly, propose a re-calibration
mechanism to address it. (4) We show that LASP is inherently amenable to
including, during training, virtual classes, i.e. class names for which no
visual samples are available, further increasing the robustness of the learned
prompts. Through evaluations on 11 datasets, we show that our approach (a)
significantly outperforms all prior works on soft prompting, and (b) matches
and surpasses, for the first time, the accuracy on novel classes obtained by
hand-crafted prompts and CLIP for 8 out of 11 test datasets. Code will be made

highly resilient to disruption by tides. Self-interactions between dark matter
particles, or the cycling of baryons, may result in the formation of a
constant-density core which would make haloes more susceptible to tidal
disruption. We use N-body simulations to study the evolution of NFW-like
""cored"" subhaloes in the tidal field of a massive host, and identify the
criteria and timescales for full tidal disruption. Our results imply that the
survival of Milky Way satellites places constraints on the sizes of dark matter
cores. Indeed, we find that no subhaloes with cores larger than 1 per cent of
their initial NFW scale radius can survive for a Hubble time on orbits with
pericentres <10 kpc. A satellite like Tucana 3, with pericentre ~3.5 kpc, must
have a core size smaller than ~2 pc to survive just three orbital periods on
its current orbit. The core sizes expected in self-interacting dark matter
(SIDM) models with a velocity-independent cross section of 1 cm^2/g seem
incompatible with ultra-faint satellites with small pericentric radii, such as
Tuc 3, Seg 1, Seg 2, Ret 2, Tri 2, and Wil 1, as these should have fully
disrupted if accreted on to the Milky Way >10 Gyr ago. These results suggest
that many satellites have vanishingly small core sizes, consistent with CDM
cusps. The discovery of further Milky Way satellites on orbits with small

stellar winds from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, ram pressure, gas
accretion onto the cluster, and photoionisation feedback of binary stars. We
find that the stellar luminosity is strong enough to warm and ionise the
intracluster medium, but it does not lead to a significant gas expulsion. The
cluster can thus retain the ejecta of AGB stars and the accreted pristine gas.
In addition, efficient cooling occurs in the central region of the cluster
within $50 \mathrm{Myr}$ from the formation of first generation stars, leading
to the formation of SG stars. Our results indicate that the inclusion of
photoionisation does not suppress SG formation, but rather delays it by about
$\sim10 \mathrm{Myr}$. The time delay depends on the density of the pristine
gas, so that a denser medium exhibits a shorter delay in star formation.
Moreover, photoionisation leads to a modest decrease in the total SG mass,
compared to a model without it.

order to test the performance of current gyrochronology relations, we construct
samples of stellar pairs with coeval components, for a range of ages and with
available rotation periods. These include both randomly paired stars in
clusters, and wide binaries in the Kepler field. We design a parameter, $\Delta
P_{rot, gyro}$, that quantifies the level of agreement between the components
of coeval stellar pairs and the gyrochronology calibrations under scrutiny. Our
results show that wide binaries and cluster members are in better concordance
with gyrochronology than samples of randomly paired field stars (which we use
as a control group), confirming that the relations do have predicting power in
identifying coeval stars. However, the agreement with the examined relations
decreases for older stars, suggesting a degradation of the current
gyrochronology with age, in agreement with recent literature results. We argue
for the need of novel gyrochronology constraints at older ages that may allow
revised calibrations. Ultimately, using coeval stars to test gyrochronology
poses the advantage of circumventing the need for age determinations while
simultaneously exploiting larger samples at older ages. In addition, taking
gyrochronology at face value, we note that our results provide new empirical

exhibits year-long outbursts with a mean period of 973 days. Using digitized
photographic archives, we show that the earliest recorded outburst occurred in
1910. We propose that this object is a U Gem-type dwarf nova with extreme
properties. The orbital variability of the system in outburst shows clear signs
of an accretion disc, from which the outburst likely originates. During
quiescence, the object slowly brightens by up to $0.75$ mag in the $I$ band
over 600 days before the outburst and exhibits small flares with amplitude
$\lesssim 0.2$ mag in the $I$ band. We interpret the gradual brightening as an
increase in the luminosity and temperature of the accretion disc, which is
theoretically predicted but only rarely seen in DNe. The origin of small flares
remains unexplained. The spectra shows Balmer absorption lines both in
quiescence and outburst, which can be associated with a bright secondary star
or a cold accretion disc. During outbursts, emission lines with FWHM of about
450 km s$^{-1}$ appear, but they lack typical double-peaked profiles. We
suggest that either these lines originate in the disc winds or the orbital
inclination is low, the latter being consistent with constrains obtained from
the orbital variability of the system. Due to its extreme properties and
peculiarities, OGLE-BLG504.12.201843 is an excellent object for further
follow-up studies.

spatially coincident with one of the star-forming complexes; however, it is
most likely to reside in its foreground since it has a much smaller extinction

constrains the progenitor's age to be $\gtrsim$10 Myr and initial mass to be

identify 169 (12%) galaxies which show stellar-gas misalignments. Kinematically
decoupled features are more prevalent in early-type/passive galaxies compared

misaligned gas discs are smaller for more centrally concentrated galaxies,
while the newly accreted gas feels lower viscous drag forces in more gas-poor
objects. Marginal evidence of star formation not being correlated with
misalignment likelihood for late-type galaxies suggests that such morphologies
in the nearby Universe might be the result of preferentially aligned accretion
at higher redshifts.

The stochastic dynamics of the relaxion is described by means of the

taking into account transitions between the neighboring local minima of its

""classical-beats-quantum"" regime. We determine that for a large Hubble
parameter during inflation, the random walk prevents the relaxion from getting
trapped at the first minimum. The relaxion stops much further away, where the
potential is less shallow. Interestingly, this essentially jeopardises the
""runaway relaxion"" threat from finite-density effects, restoring most of the
relaxion parameter space. We also explore the ""quantum-beats-classical"" regime,
opening large new regions of parameter space. We investigate the consequences
for both the QCD and the non-QCD relaxion. The misalignment of the relaxion due
to fluctuations around its local minimum opens new phenomenological

advantages. It eliminates double coverages of the parameter space, vanishes in
flat spacetime and when small, it corresponds to the mass density of an
infinite string. After a comprehensive analysis of the local and global
geometry, we proceed with the physical interpretation of the Levi-Civita
spacetime. First we show that the Newtonian gravitational force is attractive
and its magnitude increases monotonically with all positive ${\mu}_K$,
asymptoting to the inverse of the the proper distance in the ""radial""

(hence gravity in the Einsteinian sense) attains a maximum at $\mu_K=1/2$ and
then decreases asymptotically to zero. Hence, from a physical point of view the
Komar mass density of the Levi-Civita spacetime encompasses two contributions:
Newtonian gravity and acceleration effects. An increase in $\mu_K$ strengthens
Newtonian gravity but also drags the field lines increasingly parallel,
eventually transforming Newtonian gravity through the equivalence principle
into a pure acceleration field and the Levi-Civita spacetime into a flat
Rindler-like spacetime. In a geometric picture the increase of $\mu_K$ from
zero to $\infty$ deforms the planar sections of the spacetime into ever
deepening funnels, eventually degenerating into cylindrical topology.

dynamical behavior which, due to a lack of appropriate numerical methods, has
remained relatively unexplored. Furthermore, the implications associated with
the presence of such odd terms in actomyosin and other similar anisotropic

first outline how odd effects may naturally emerge from a theory of polymeric
elasticity which can describe anisotropic systems like actomyosin. Next, we

instability which produces an oscillating array of fluid vortices, and strong
transverse and rotational forces during a simulated rheological experiment.
These findings can guide efforts to detect or engineer odd dynamics in soft

learning (DRL) where the underlying dynamic system is unknown (an opaque box).
Unlike prior work, this paper considers scenarios where the given LTL
specification might be infeasible and therefore cannot be accomplished
globally. Instead of modifying the given LTL formula, we provide a general
DRL-based approach to satisfy it with minimal violation. To do this, we
transform a previously multi-objective DRL problem, which requires simultaneous
automata satisfaction and minimum violation cost, into a single objective. By
guiding the DRL agent with a sampling-based path planning algorithm for the
potentially infeasible LTL task, the proposed approach mitigates the myopic
tendencies of DRL, which are often an issue when learning general LTL tasks
that can have long or infinite horizons. This is achieved by decomposing an
infeasible LTL formula into several reach-avoid sub-tasks with shorter
horizons, which can be trained in a modular DRL architecture. Furthermore, we
overcome the challenge of the exploration process for DRL in complex and
cluttered environments by using path planners to design rewards that are dense
in the configuration space. The benefits of the presented approach are
demonstrated through testing on various complex nonlinear systems and compared
with state-of-the-art baselines. The Video demonstration can be found

capture of spatial-temporal correlations among a group of loads that are served
by the same distribution transformer. This enables the generation of a large
amount of correlated SLPs required for microgrid and distribution system
studies. The novelty and uniqueness of the MultiLoad-GAN framework are
three-fold. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first method for
generating a group of load profiles bearing realistic spatial-temporal
correlations simultaneously. Second, two complementary realisticness metrics
for evaluating generated load profiles are developed: computing statistics
based on domain knowledge and comparing high-level features via a deep-learning

mechanism is developed to generate training samples for enhancing the training

(cosmic rays) due to the mechanism of stochastic turbulent acceleration (STA)
in presence of small-scale turbulence with a mean magnetic field. STA is
usually modelled as a biased random walk process in the momentum space of the
non-thermal particles. This results in an advection-diffusion type transport
equation for the non-thermal particle distribution function. Under quasilinear
approximation, and by assuming a turbulent spectrum with single scale injection
at sub-gyroscale, we find that the Fokker-Planck diffusion coefficients
$D_{\gamma\gamma}$ and $D_{\mu\mu}$ scale with the Lorentz factor $\gamma$ as:
$D_{\gamma\gamma}\propto\gamma^{-2/3}$ and $D_{\mu\mu}\propto\gamma^{-8/3}$.
Furthermore, with the calculated transport coefficients, we numerically solve
the advection-diffusion type transport equation for the non-thermal particles.
We demonstrate the interplay of various mircophysical processes such as STA,
synchrotron loss and particle escape on the particle distribution by
systematically varying the parameters of the problem.

  Propagation",,,,,"cs.LG cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Temporal graph is an abstraction for modeling dynamic systems that consist of
evolving interaction elements. In this paper, we aim to solve an important yet
neglected problem -- how to learn information from high-order neighbors in
temporal graphs? -- to enhance the informativeness and discriminativeness for
the learned node representations. We argue that when learning high-order
information from temporal graphs, we encounter two challenges, i.e.,
computational inefficiency and over-smoothing, that cannot be solved by
conventional techniques applied on static graphs. To remedy these deficiencies,
we propose a temporal propagation-based graph neural network, namely TPGNN. To
be specific, the model consists of two distinct components, i.e., propagator
and node-wise encoder. The propagator is leveraged to propagate messages from
the anchor node to its temporal neighbors within $k$-hop, and then
simultaneously update the state of neighborhoods, which enables efficient
computation, especially for a deep model. In addition, to prevent
over-smoothing, the model compels the messages from $n$-hop neighbors to update
the $n$-hop memory vector preserved on the anchor. The node-wise encoder adopts
transformer architecture to learn node representations by explicitly learning
the importance of memory vectors preserved on the node itself, that is,
implicitly modeling the importance of messages from neighbors at different
layers, thus mitigating the over-smoothing. Since the encoding process will not
query temporal neighbors, we can dramatically save time consumption in
inference. Extensive experiments on temporal link prediction and node
classification demonstrate the superiority of TPGNN over state-of-the-art
baselines in efficiency and robustness.

optimal in \emph{two} criteria, namely, its time and message complexities. For
\emph{synchronous} CONGEST networks, such algorithms are known for fundamental
distributed computing problems such as leader election [Kutten et al., JACM
2015] and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) construction [Pandurangan et al., STOC
2017, Elkin, PODC 2017]. However, it is open whether a singularly (near)
optimal bound can be obtained for the MST construction problem in general
\emph{asynchronous} CONGEST networks.
  We present a randomized distributed MST algorithm that, with high
probability, computes an MST in \emph{asynchronous} CONGEST networks and takes
$\tilde{O}(D^{1+\epsilon} + \sqrt{n})$ time and $\tilde{O}(m)$ messages, where
$n$ is the number of nodes, $m$ the number of edges, $D$ is the diameter of the
network, and $\epsilon >0$ is an arbitrarily small constant (both time and
message bounds hold with high probability). Our algorithm is message optimal
(up to a polylog$(n)$ factor) and almost time optimal (except for a
$D^{\epsilon}$ factor). Our result answers an open question raised in Mashregi
and King [DISC 2019] by giving the first known asynchronous MST algorithm that
has sublinear time (for all $D = O(n^{1-\epsilon})$) and uses $\tilde{O}(m)$
messages. Using a result of Mashregi and King [DISC 2019], this also yields the
first asynchronous MST algorithm that is sublinear in both time and messages in
the $KT_1$ CONGEST model.
  A key tool in our algorithm is the construction of a low diameter rooted
spanning tree in asynchronous CONGEST that has depth
$\tilde{O}(D^{1+\epsilon})$ (for an arbitrarily small constant $\epsilon > 0$)
in $\tilde{O}(D^{1+\epsilon})$ time and $\tilde{O}(m)$ messages. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first such construction that is almost singularly
optimal in the asynchronous setting.

a long two-level laser amplifier under trivial initial conditions. In this
paper, we consider an unstable model described by the Maxwell-Bloch equations
without spectral broadening. Previously, this model was studied by S.V. Manakov
in 1982 and together with V.Yu. Novokshenov in 1986. We consider this model in
a more natural formulation as an initial-boundary (mixed) problem using a
modern version of the inverse scattering transform method in the form of a
suitable Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem. The RH problem arises as a result of
applying the Fokas-Its method of simultaneous analysis of the corresponding
spectral problems for the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) equations. This
approach makes it possible to obtain rigorous asymptotic results at large
times, which differ significantly from the previous ones. Differences take
place both near the light cone and in the tail region, where a new type of
solitons is found against an oscillating background. These solitons are
physically relevant, their velocities are smaller than the speed of light. The
number of such solitons can be either finite or infinite (in the latter case,
the set of zeros has a condensation point at infinity). Such solitons can not
be reflectionless, they are generated by zeros of the reflection coefficient of
the input pulse (and not by poles of the transmission coefficient).
  Thus our approach shows the presence of a new phenomenon in soliton theory,
namely, the boundary condition (input pulse) of a mixed problem under trivial
initial conditions can generate solitons due to the zeros of the reflection
coefficient, while the poles of the transmission coefficient do not contribute
to the asymptotics of the solution.

applied them to the World Trade Web, i.e. the network of international trade

discrete-valued link weights, the present paper extends the theoretical
framework to continuous-valued link weights. In particular, we construct two
broad classes of maximum-entropy models, namely the integrated and the
conditional ones, defined by different criteria to derive and combine the
probabilistic rules for placing links and loading them with weights. In the
integrated models, both rules follow from a single, constrained optimization of
the continuous Kullback-Leibler divergence; in the conditional models, the two
rules are disentangled and the functional form of the weight distribution
follows from a conditional, optimization procedure. After deriving the general
functional form of the two classes, we turn each of them into a proper family
of econometric models via a suitable identification of the econometric function
relating the corresponding, expected link weights to macroeconomic factors.

macroscopic properties of correlated materials. For 5d transition metal
compounds, electron correlations alone generally do not lead to a

from their coupling with magnetic ordering and/or structural distortions.
1$T$-TaS$_2$ is a prototypical example of such correlated insulating behavior,
with a high-symmetry metallic phase transforming into a distorted, charge
density wave (CDW) insulating state at low temperatures. The relevance of the
localized electron physics at play in 3d compounds to these 5d transition metal
compounds remains an open question. We resolved this standing controversy in
1$T$-TaS$_2$ combining resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopy and
first-principles calculations. We observed five electronic excitations arising
from the interband transitions of the Ta 5d orbitals and the S 3p ligand state,
with none of the excitations on the order of the Mott gap. These excitations
cannot be explained within the framework of standard multiplet calculations
that assume a localized wavefunction, but instead, are captured by a band
theory framework accounting for the low symmetry of the crystal field in the
CDW state. Our findings suggest that the electronic property of 1$T$-TaS$_2$ is
dominated by both plasmonic quasiparticles and inter-band transitions
associated with a Drude-type response, with no resonance associated with a

increasingly operating in dynamic environments and close physical proximity to

predict their future states and plan safe and efficient trajectories. However,
no model is ever perfect -- when the observed human behavior deviates from the
model predictions, the robot might plan unsafe maneuvers. Recent works have
explored maintaining a confidence parameter in the human model to overcome this
challenge, wherein the predicted human actions are tempered online based on the
likelihood of the observed human action under the prediction model. This has
opened up a new research challenge, i.e., \textit{how to compute the future
human states online as the confidence parameter changes?} In this work, we
propose a Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based approach to overcome this
challenge. Treating the confidence parameter as a virtual state in the system,
we compute a parameter-conditioned forward reachable tube (FRT) that provides
the future human states as a function of the confidence parameter. Online, as
the confidence parameter changes, we can simply query the corresponding FRT,
and use it to update the robot plan. Computing parameter-conditioned FRT
corresponds to an (offline) high-dimensional reachability problem, which we
solve by leveraging recent advances in data-driven reachability analysis.
Overall, our framework enables online maintenance and updates of safety
assurances in human-robot interaction scenarios, even when the human prediction
model is incorrect. We demonstrate our approach in several safety-critical
autonomous driving scenarios, involving a state-of-the-art deep learning-based

scale challenges of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Without relying on a spherical or
elliptical collapse model, we analytically derive the halo mass function and
density profile based on the mass and energy cascade in dark matter flow. The
hierarchical halo structure formation from gravitational collapse can be
equivalent to a random walk process with a position-dependent waiting time
$\tau_g$. The inverse mass cascade leads to the random walk in halo mass space
with $\tau_g\propto m_r^{-\lambda}$, where $m_r$ is the halo mass and $\lambda$
is a halo geometry parameter. The corresponding Fokker-Planck solution gives
rise to the analytical halo mass function with a power-law behavior on small
scale and exponential decay on large scale. This can be further improved by
considering two different $\lambda$ for haloes below and above a critical mass
scale $m_h^*$, i.e. a double-$\lambda$ mass function. Similarly, a
double-$\gamma$ halo density profile can be derived based on the particle
random walk in 3D space with a position-dependent waiting time $\tau_g \propto
m_r^{-\lambda}\propto r^{-\gamma}$, where $r$ is the halo size and $m_r \propto
r^{5/3}$ from energy cascade. The Press-Schechter mass function and Einasto
profile are just special cases of the proposed model. The small scale
permanence can be identified due to the scale-independent rate of cascade,
where halo density profiles of different halo mass and redshifts converge to
the $-4/3$ scaling law ($\rho_h \propto r^{-4/3}$) on small scale. The halo
number density scales with halo mass as $\propto m_h^{-1.9}$, while halo mass
density scales as $\propto m_h^{4/9}$. Results are validated and compared
against the large scale cosmological Illustris simulation. This new perspective
provides a possible theory for the origin of halo mass function and density
profile.

of a generative model on substantial local regions. Hence, we exploit a

the need to collect data from many homogeneous 3D scenes for learning common

expensive, time-consuming, and unavailable to the general public; furthermore,
they are not very accurate. These constraints encouraged us to develop a novel
technique using SHAP and Hard Voting Ensemble Method based on voice signals.
Methods: In this article, we used Pearson Correlation Coefficients to
understand the relationship between input features and the output, and finally,
input features with high correlation were selected. These selected features
were classified by the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient
Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Gradient Boosting, and Bagging. Moreover, the Hard
Voting Ensemble Method was determined based on the performance of the four
classifiers. At the final stage, we proposed Shapley Additive exPlanations

Parkinson's disease. Results and Conclusion: The proposed method achieved
85.42% accuracy, 84.94% F1-score, 86.77% precision, 87.62% specificity, and
83.20% sensitivity. The study's findings demonstrated that the proposed method
outperformed state-of-the-art approaches and can assist physicians in

be deployed in neuromorphic hardware and achieve extremely high energy
efficiency. However, SNNs currently can hardly realize a comparable performance
to that of artificial neural networks (ANNs) because their limited scalability
does not allow for large-scale networks. Especially for Transformer, as a model
of ANNs that has accomplished remarkable performance in various machine
learning tasks, its implementation in SNNs by conventional methods requires a
large number of neurons, notably in the self-attention module. Inspired by the
mechanisms in the nervous system, we propose an efficient spiking Transformer
(EST) framework enabled by partial information to address the above problem. In
this model, we not only implemented the self-attention module with a reasonable
number of neurons, but also introduced partial-information self-attention
(PSA), which utilizes only partial input signals, further reducing
computational resources compared to conventional methods. The experimental
results show that our EST can outperform the state-of-the-art SNN model in
terms of accuracy and the number of time steps on both Cifar-10/100 and
ImageNet datasets. In particular, the proposed EST model achieves 78.48% top-1
accuracy on the ImageNet dataset with only 16 time steps. In addition, our
proposed PSA reduces flops by 49.8% with negligible performance loss compared
to a self-attention module with full information.

correct performance of movement exercises. A system that automatically

rarely rely on Deep Learning methods and do not yet fully use their potential.
(2) Methods: Using a measurement system consisting of 17 IMUs, a dataset of
four Functional Movement Screening (FMS) exercises is recorded. Exercise
execution is evaluated by physiotherapists using the FMS criteria. This dataset
is used to train a neural network that assigns the correct FMS score to an
exercise repetition. We use an architecture consisting of CNN, LSTM and Dense
layers. Based on this framework, we apply various methods to optimize the
performance of the network. For the optimization, we perform a extensive
hyperparameter optimization. In addition, we are comparing different CNN
structures that have been specifically adapted for use with IMU data. Finally,
the developed network is trained with the data of different FMS exercises and
the performance is compared. (3) Results: The evaluation shows that the
presented approach achieves a convincing performance in the classification of
unknown repetitions of already known subjects. However, the trained network is
yet unable to achieve consistent performance on the data of a previously
unknown subjects. Additionally, it can be seen that the performance of the
network differs significantly depending on the exercise it is trained for.

work is to provide a realistic evaluation of PDA methods with the different
model selection strategies under a consistent evaluation protocol. We evaluate
7 representative PDA algorithms on 2 different real-world datasets using 7
different model selection strategies. Our two main findings are: (i) without

colloidal probe. In this context, sliding states with nearly-vanishing
friction, i.e. superlubricity, may set in. A comprehensive investigation of the
transfer layer properties is mandatory to ascertain the origin of
superlubricity. Here we explore the friction response of micrometric beads, of
different size and pristine surface roughness, sliding on graphite under
ambient conditions. We show that such tribosystems undergo a robust transition
towards a low-adhesion, low-friction state dominated by mechanical interactions
at one dominant tribo-induced nanocontact. Friction force spectroscopy reveals
that the nanocontact can be superlubric or dissipative, in fact undergoing a
load-driven transition from dissipative stick-slip to continuous superlubric
sliding. This behavior is excellently described by the thermally-activated,
single-asperity Prandtl-Tomlinson model. Our results indicate that upon
formation of the transfer layer, friction depends on the energy landscape
experienced by the topographically-highest tribo-induced nanoasperity.
Consistently we find larger dissipation when the tribo-induced nanoasperity is

widely successful approach for generating compact, powerful models in the
semi-supervised learning setting where a limited amount of labeled data is

large number of incorrect soft-labels that impairs student performance. The
sheer size of the teacher additionally constrains the number of soft-labels

The difficulty in achieving simultaneous \emph{efficiency} (i.e., minimizing

distillation to many modern tasks. In this paper, we present a parameter-free

to determine the physical origin of the twisty patterns of linear polarization
seen in spatially resolved black hole images and explain their morphological
dependence on black hole spin. By characterising the observed emission with a
simple analytic ring model, we find that the twisty morphology is determined by
the magnetic field structure in the emitting region. Moreover, the dependence
of this twisty pattern on spin can be attributed to changes in the magnetic
field geometry that occur due to the frame dragging. By studying an analytic
ring model, we find that the roles of Doppler boosting and lensing are
subdominant. Faraday rotation may cause a systematic shift in the linear
polarization pattern, but we find that its impact is subdominant for models
with strong magnetic fields and modest ion-to-electron temperature ratios.
Models with weaker magnetic fields are much more strongly affected by Faraday
rotation and have more complicated emission geometries than can be captured by
a ring model. However, these models are currently disfavoured by the recent EHT
observations of M87*. Our results suggest that linear polarization maps can
provide a probe of the underlying magnetic field structure around a black hole,
which may then be usable to indirectly infer black hole spins. The generality
of these results should be tested with alternative codes, initial conditions,

inadequate generalization for sparse state spaces. The options framework with
temporal abstractions is perhaps the most promising method to solve these

convergence, and it is challenging to automate initiation and termination

  Our proposal, the Deep Variational Q-Network (DVQN), combines deep

a Gaussian distributed latent-space, which is especially useful for defining
options. The DVQN algorithm uses MSE with KL-divergence as regularization,
combined with traditional Q-Learning updates. The algorithm learns a
latent-space that represents good policies with state clusters for options. We
show that the DVQN algorithm is a promising approach for identifying initiation

comparable performance to Rainbow and can maintain stability when trained for
extended periods after convergence.

continuous- and discrete-time linear systems. A simply structured distributed
estimator is first described for estimating the state of a continuous-time,
jointly observable, input free, multi-channel linear system whose sensed
outputs are distributed across a fixed multi-agent network. The estimator is
then extended to non-stationary networks whose graphs switch according to a
switching signal with a fixed dwell time or a variable but with fixed average
dwell time, or switch arbitrarily under appropriate assumptions. The estimator
is guaranteed to solve the problem, provided a network-widely shared gain is
sufficiently large. As an alternative to sharing a common gain across the
network, a fully distributed version of the estimator is thus studied in which
each agent adaptively adjusts a local gain though the practicality of this
approach is subject to a robustness issue common to adaptive control. A
discrete-time version of the distributed state estimation problem is also
studied, and a corresponding estimator is proposed for time-varying networks.
For each scenario, it is explained how to construct the estimator so that its
state estimation errors all converge to zero exponentially fast at a fixed but
arbitrarily chosen rate, provided the network's graph is strongly connected for
all time. This is accomplished by appealing to the ``split-spectrum'' approach
and exploiting several well-known properties of invariant subspace. The
proposed estimators are inherently resilient to abrupt changes in the number of
agents and communication links in the inter-agent communication graph upon
which the algorithms depend, provided the network is redundantly strongly
connected and redundantly jointly observable.

corrupted by additive noise. We go beyond the usual independence assumption on
the noise entries, by drawing the noise from a low-order polynomial orthogonal
matrix ensemble. The resulting noise correlations make the setting relevant for
applications but analytically challenging. We provide the first
characterization of the Bayes-optimal limits of inference in this model. If the
spike is rotation-invariant, we show that standard spectral PCA is optimal.
However, for more general priors, both PCA and the existing approximate message
passing algorithm (AMP) fall short of achieving the information-theoretic
limits, which we compute using the replica method from statistical mechanics.
We thus propose a novel AMP, inspired by the theory of Adaptive
Thouless-Anderson-Palmer equations, which saturates the theoretical limit. This
AMP comes with a rigorous state evolution analysis tracking its performance.
Although we focus on specific noise distributions, our methodology can be
generalized to a wide class of trace matrix ensembles at the cost of more

challenges, including training instability due to the combinatorial action

practical paradigm for NLP?
  To help answer this, we first introduce an open-source modular library,
RL4LMs (Reinforcement Learning for Language Models), for optimizing language
generators with RL. The library consists of on-policy RL algorithms that can be
used to train any encoder or encoder-decoder LM in the HuggingFace library

we introduce an easy-to-use, performant RL algorithm, NLPO (Natural Language

action space in language generation. We show 1) that RL techniques are
generally better than supervised methods at aligning LMs to human preferences;

rely on a spatio-temporal representation constructed from a collection of
events over a fixed period of time (often between two grayscale frames). As a
result, optical flow is only evaluated at a frequency much lower than the rate

optical flow estimation. To predict temporally dense optical flow, we cast the
problem as a sequential learning task and propose a training methodology to
train sequential networks for continuous prediction on an event stream. We
propose two types of networks: one focused on performance and another focused
on compute efficiency. We first train long-short term memory networks (LSTMs)
on the DSEC dataset and demonstrated 10x temporally dense optical flow
estimation over existing flow estimation approaches. The additional benefit of
having a memory to draw long temporal correlations back in time results in a
19.7% improvement in flow prediction accuracy of LSTMs over similar networks
with no memory elements. We subsequently show that the inherent recurrence of
spiking neural networks (SNNs) enables them to learn and estimate temporally
dense optical flow with 31.8% lesser parameters than LSTM, but with a slightly
increased error. This demonstrates potential for energy-efficient
implementation of fast optical flow prediction using SNNs.

gradient issue plaguing the training of neural networks (NNs), significant
efforts have been exerted to overcome this obstacle. However, a clear solution
to the V/E issue remained elusive so far. In this manuscript a new architecture
of NN is proposed, designed to mathematically prevent the V/E issue to occur.
The pursuit of approximate dynamical isometry, i.e. parameter configurations
where the singular values of the input-output Jacobian are tightly distributed
around 1, leads to the derivation of a NN's architecture that shares common
traits with the popular Residual Network model. Instead of skipping connections
between layers, the idea is to filter the previous activations orthogonally and
add them to the nonlinear activations of the next layer, realising a convex
combination between them. Remarkably, the impossibility for the gradient
updates to either vanish or explode is demonstrated with analytical bounds that
hold even in the infinite depth case. The effectiveness of this method is
empirically proved by means of training via backpropagation an extremely deep
multilayer perceptron of 50k layers, and an Elman NN to learn long-term
dependencies in the input of 10k time steps in the past. Compared with other
architectures specifically devised to deal with the V/E problem, e.g. LSTMs for
recurrent NNs, the proposed model is way simpler yet more effective.
Surprisingly, a single layer vanilla RNN can be enhanced to reach state of the
art performance, while converging super fast; for instance on the psMNIST task,
it is possible to get test accuracy of over 94% in the first epoch, and over
98% after just 10 epochs.

  Behaviors",,,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has seen many recent successes for quadruped
robot control. The imitation of reference motions provides a simple and
powerful prior for guiding solutions towards desired solutions without the need
for meticulous reward design. While much work uses motion capture data or
hand-crafted trajectories as the reference motion, relatively little work has
explored the use of reference motions coming from model-based trajectory
optimization. In this work, we investigate several design considerations that
arise with such a framework, as demonstrated through four dynamic behaviours:
trot, front hop, 180 backflip, and biped stepping. These are trained in
simulation and transferred to a physical Solo 8 quadruped robot without further
adaptation. In particular, we explore the space of feed-forward designs
afforded by the trajectory optimizer to understand its impact on RL learning
efficiency and sim-to-real transfer. These findings contribute to the long
standing goal of producing robot controllers that combine the interpretability
and precision of model-based optimization with the robustness that model-free
RL-based controllers offer.

Stokes flow to periodic boundary conditions in any number (three, two, one, or
none) of the spatial directions, in a unified framework. The periodic potential
is split into a short-range and a long-range part, where the latter is treated
in Fourier space using the fast Fourier transform. A crucial component of the
method is the modified kernels used to treat singular integration. We derive
new modified kernels, and new improved truncation error estimates for the
stokeslet and stresslet. An automated procedure for selecting parameters based
on a given error tolerance is designed and tested. Analytical formulas for
validation in the doubly and singly periodic cases are presented. We show that
the computational time of the method scales like O(N log N) for N sources and

function, i.e. the function used to smoothly spread irregular point data to a
uniform grid. The method is fastest in the fully periodic case, while the run
time in the free-space case is around three times as large. Furthermore, the
highest efficiency is reached when applying the method to a uniform source
distribution in a primary cell with low aspect ratio. The work presented in

example, the detection of exoplanets via the Doppler effect hinges on the
ability to calibrate a high resolution spectrograph. Laser frequency combs can
be used for this, but the wildly varying intensity across the spectrum can make
it impossible to optimally utilize the entire comb, leading to a reduced
overall precision of calibration. To circumvent this, astronomical applications
of laser frequency combs rely on a bulk optic setup which can flatten the
output spectrum before sending it to the spectrograph. Such flatteners require
complex and expensive optical elements like spatial light modulators and have
non-negligible bench top footprints. Here we present an alternative in the form
of an all-photonic spectral shaper that can be used to flatten the spectrum of
a laser frequency comb. The device consists of a circuit etched into a silicon
nitride wafer that supports an arrayed-waveguide grating to disperse the light
over hundreds of nanometers in wavelength, followed by Mach-Zehnder
interferometers to control the amplitude of each channel, thermo-optic phase
modulators to phase the channels and a second arrayed-waveguide grating to
recombine the spectrum. The demonstrator device operates from 1400 to 1800 nm
(covering the astronomical H band), with twenty 20 nm wide channels. The device
allows for nearly 40 dBs of dynamic modulation of the spectrum via the
Mach-Zehnders , which is greater than that offered by most spatial light
modulators. With a superluminescent diode, we reduced the static spectral
variation to ~3 dB, limited by the properties of the components used in the
circuit and on a laser frequency comb we managed to reduce the modulation to 5
dBs, sufficient for astronomical applications.

importance for the university's educational mission. This paper is dedicated to
the study of course-prerequisite networks (CPNs), where nodes represent courses
and directed links represent the formal prerequisite relationships between
them. The main goal of CPNs is to model interactions between courses, represent
the flow of knowledge in academic curricula, and serve as a key tool for
visualizing, analyzing, and optimizing complex curricula. First, we consider
several classical centrality measures, discuss their meaning in the context of
CPNs, and use them for the identification of important courses. Next, we
describe the hierarchical structure of a CPN using the topological
stratification of the network. Finally, we perform the interdependence
analysis, which allows to quantify the strength of knowledge flow between
university divisions and helps to identify the most intradependent,
influential, and interdisciplinary areas of study. We discuss how
course-prerequisite networks can be used by students, faculty, and
administrators for detecting important courses, improving existing and creating
new courses, navigating complex curricula, allocating teaching resources,
increasing interdisciplinary interactions between departments, revamping
curricula, and enhancing the overall students' learning experience. The
proposed methodology can be used for the analysis of any CPN, and it is
illustrated with a network of courses taught at the California Institute of
Technology. The network data analyzed in this paper is publicly available in
the GitHub repository.

such as boundary zero sets of analytic functions, inner functions with
derivative in the Nevanlinna class, cyclicity in weighted Bergman spaces,
Fuchsian groups of Widom-type and the corona problem in quotient Banach
algebras. After surveying these developments, we give a general definition of
Beurling-Carleson sets and discuss some of their basic properties. We show that
the Roberts decomposition characterizes measures that do not charge
Beurling-Carleson sets.
  For a positive singular measure $\mu$ on the unit circle, let $S_\mu$ denote
the singular inner function with singular measure $\mu$. In the second part of
the paper, we use a corona-type decomposition to relate a number of properties
of singular measures on the unit circle such as the membership of $S'_\mu$ in
the Nevanlinna class $\mathcal N$, area conditions on level sets of $S_\mu$ and
wepability. It was known that each of these properties hold for measures
concentrated on Beurling-Carleson sets. We show that each of these properties
implies that $\mu$ lives on a countable union of Beurling-Carleson sets. We
also describe partial relations involving the membership of $S'_\mu$ in the
Hardy space $H^p$, membership of $S_\mu$ in the Besov space $B^p$ and
$(1-p)$-Beurling-Carleson sets and give a number of examples which show that
our results are optimal.
  Finally, we show that measures that live on countable unions of
$\alpha$-Beurling-Carleson sets are in bijection with nearly-maximal solutions
of $\Delta u = u^p \cdot \chi_{u > 0}$ when $p > 3$ and $\alpha =
\frac{p-3}{p-1}$.

timing jitter caused by internal device properties and features of the RF

in the latency of timing measurements. To compensate for this, we demonstrate a
calibration method that correlates delays in detection events with the time
elapsed between pulses. The increase in jitter at high rates can be largely
canceled in software by applying corrections derived from the calibration
process. We demonstrate our method with a single-pixel tungsten silicide SNSPD

effective at removing a long tail that appears in the instrument response

methodologies from generic computer vision, except for one major omission:
benchmark datasets are not utilised to evaluate models across studies, making
it difficult to compare results. Additionally, some studies have specifically
utilised the extra spectral resolution available in satellite imagery, but
other divergent properties of satellite images - such as the hugely different
scales of spatial patterns - are not being taken advantage of in the reviewed

We show how this factorization alters the underlying loss landscape and
effectively enables each neuron in the network to learn using its own

but also allows networks to quickly recover from poor initializations and reach
better local minima. We demonstrate how random weight factorization can be
leveraged to improve the training of neural representations on a variety of

inverse rendering, solving partial differential equations, and learning
operators between function spaces.

modify free charge carrier generation in donor-acceptor heterojunctions because
of the delocalization and controllable energy level properties of hybridized
light-matter states known as polaritons. However, in many experimental systems,
cavity coupling decreases charge separation. Here, we theoretically study the
quantum dynamics of a coherent and dissipative donor-acceptor cavity system, to
investigate the dynamical mechanism and further discover the conditions under
which polaritons may enhance free charge carrier generation. We use open
quantum system methods based on single-pulse pumping to find that polaritons
have the potential to connect excitonic states and charge separated states,
further enhancing free charge generation on an ultrafast timescale of several
hundred femtoseconds. The mechanism involves that polaritons with proper energy
levels allow the exciton to overcome the high Coulomb barrier induced by
electron-hole attraction. Moreover, we propose that a second-hybridization
between a polariton state and dark states with similar energy enables the
formation of the hybrid charge separated states that are optically active.
These two mechanisms lead to a maximum of 50% enhancement of free charge
carrier generation on a short timescale. However, our simulation reveals that
on the longer timescale of picoseconds, internal conversion and cavity loss
dominate and suppress free charge carrier generation, reproducing the
experimental results. Thus, our work shows that polaritons can affect the
charge separation mechanism and promote free charge carrier generation
efficiency, but predominantly on a short timescale after photoexcitation.

noisy output of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The approach utilizes
Relative Entropy (RE) to choose the optimum impulse response estimate, optimum
time delay and optimum impulse response length. The desired RE is the
Kulback-Lielber divergence of the estimated distribution from its unknown true
distribution. A unique probabilistic validation approach estimates the desired
relative entropy and minimizes this criterion to provide the impulse response
estimate. Classical methods have approached this system modeling problem from
two separate angles for the time delay estimation and for the order selection.
Time delay methods focus on time delay estimate minimizing various proposed
criteria, while the existing order selection approaches choose the optimum
impulse response length based on their proposed criteria. The strength of the
proposed RE based method is in using the RE based criterion to estimate both
the time delay and impulse response length simultaneously. In addition,
estimation of the noise variance, when the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is
unknown is also concurrent and is based on optimizing the same RE based
criterion. The RE based approach is also extended for online impulse response
estimations. The online method reduces the model estimation computational
complexity upon the arrival of a new sample. The introduced efficient stopping
criteria for this online approaches is extremely valuable in practical
applications. Simulation results illustrate precision and efficiency of the
proposed method compared to the conventional time delay or order selection
approaches.

among brain regions vary over the course of an fMRI experiment. The transitions
between different individual connectivity states can be modulated by changes in

e.g., changes in attention or cognitive effort as measured by pupil dilation.
In this paper, we develop a multi-subject Bayesian framework for estimating
dynamic functional networks as a function of time-varying exogenous
physiological covariates that are simultaneously recorded in each subject
during the fMRI experiment. More specifically, we consider a dynamic Gaussian
graphical model approach, where a non-homogeneous hidden Markov model is
employed to classify the fMRI time series into latent neurological states,
borrowing strength over the entire time course of the experiment. The
state-transition probabilities are assumed to vary over time and across
subjects, as a function of the underlying covariates, allowing for the
estimation of recurrent connectivity patterns and the sharing of networks among
the subjects. Our modeling approach further assumes sparsity in the network
structures, via shrinkage priors. We achieve edge selection in the estimated
graph structures, by introducing a multi-comparison procedure for
shrinkage-based inferences with Bayesian false discovery rate control. We apply
our modeling framework on a resting-state experiment where fMRI data have been
collected concurrently with pupillometry measurements, leading us to assess the
heterogeneity of the effects of changes in pupil dilation, previously linked to
changes in norepinephrine-containing locus coeruleus, on the subjects'

proposed to alleviate the computational burden of this nested-loop structure,

policy estimation at the expense of reduced reward estimation accuracy. In this

challenges of \emph{uncertainty} and \emph{clutter}. One option is to solve
retrieval problems via a sequence of prehensile pick-n-place operations, which
can be computationally expensive to compute in highly-cluttered scenarios and
also inefficient to execute. The proposed framework selects the option of
performing non-prehensile actions, such as pushing, to clean a cluttered
workspace to allow a robotic arm to retrieve a target object. Non-prehensile
actions, allow to interact simultaneously with multiple objects, which can
speed up execution. At the same time, they can significantly increase
uncertainty as it is not easy to accurately estimate the outcome of a pushing
operation in clutter. The proposed framework integrates topological tools and
Monte-Carlo tree search to achieve effective and robust pushing for object
retrieval problems. In particular, it proposes using persistent homology to
automatically identify manageable clustering of blocking objects in the
workspace without the need for manually adjusting hyper-parameters.
Furthermore, MCTS uses this information to explore feasible actions to push
groups of objects together, aiming to minimize the number of pushing actions
needed to clear the path to the target object. Real-world experiments using a
Baxter robot, which involves some noise in actuation, show that the proposed
framework achieves a higher success rate in solving retrieval tasks in dense
clutter compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Moreover, it produces
high-quality solutions with a small number of pushing actions improving the
overall execution time. More critically, it is robust enough that it allows to
plan the sequence of actions offline and then execute them reliably online with
Baxter.

561 execution-time situations in a dining domain, where each situation
corresponds to a state instance of a robot being potentially unable to complete
a task using a solution that normally works. Experimental results show that our

against adversarial data. However, current AT with a pre-specified perturbation
budget has limitations in learning a robust network. Firstly, applying a
pre-specified perturbation budget on networks of various model capacities will
yield divergent degree of robustness disparity between natural and robust
accuracies, which deviates from robust network's desideratum. Secondly, the
attack strength of adversarial training data constrained by the pre-specified
perturbation budget fails to upgrade as the growth of network robustness, which
leads to robust overfitting and further degrades the adversarial robustness. To
overcome these limitations, we propose \emph{Strength-Adaptive Adversarial
Training} (SAAT). Specifically, the adversary employs an adversarial loss
constraint to generate adversarial training data. Under this constraint, the
perturbation budget will be adaptively adjusted according to the training state
of adversarial data, which can effectively avoid robust overfitting. Besides,
SAAT explicitly constrains the attack strength of training data through the
adversarial loss, which manipulates model capacity scheduling during training,
and thereby can flexibly control the degree of robustness disparity and adjust
the tradeoff between natural accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments
show that our proposal boosts the robustness of adversarial training.

piecewise continuous coefficients that have (possibly huge) jumps across fixed
internal interfaces. In contrast with such problems involving one smooth
non-intersecting interface, that have been extensively studied, there are very
few papers addressing elliptic interface problems with intersecting interfaces
of coefficient jumps. It is well known that if the values of the permeability
in the four subregions around a point of intersection of two such internal
interfaces are all different, the solution has a point singularity that
significantly affects the accuracy of the approximation in the vicinity of the
intersection point. In the present paper we propose a fourth-order 9-point
finite difference scheme on uniform Cartesian meshes for an elliptic problem
whose coefficient is piecewise constant in four rectangular subdomains of the
overall two-dimensional rectangular domain. Moreover, for the special case when
the intersecting point of the two lines of coefficient jumps is a grid point,
such a compact scheme, involving relatively simple formulas for computation of
the stencil coefficients, can even reach sixth order of accuracy. Furthermore,
we show that the resulting linear system for the special case has an M-matrix,
and prove the theoretical sixth order convergence rate using the discrete
maximum principle. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the fourth (for the
general case) and sixth (for the special case) accuracy orders of the proposed
schemes. In the general case, we derive a compact third-order finite difference
scheme, also yielding a linear system with an M-matrix. In addition, using the
discrete maximum principle, we prove the third order convergence rate of the

irradiance over the period of a solar rotation?; How can helioseismic
monitoring contribute to data-driven global magnetic-field models for precise

prospects of a flare, CME or high-speed stream that impacts the terrestrial
environment over the period of a solar rotation?; How does the inclusion of

significantly reduce the amount of data required to describe the underlying
global dynamics of robot controllers, including closed-box ones. A Gaussian
Process (GP), trained with randomized short trajectories over the state-space,
acts as a surrogate model for the underlying dynamical system. Then, a
combinatorial representation is built and used to describe the dynamics in the
form of a directed acyclic graph, known as {\it Morse graph}. The Morse graph
is able to describe the system's attractors and their corresponding regions of
attraction (\roa). Furthermore, a pointwise confidence level of the global

alternatives, the framework does not require estimation of Lyapunov functions,
alleviating the need for high prediction accuracy of the GP. The framework is
suitable for data-driven controllers that do not expose an analytical model as

established analytical and recent machine learning alternatives for estimating
\roa s, outperforming them in data efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

analogical reasoning: reproducing patterns in linear text that occur in their

LLMs fail in scenarios that require reasoning over multiple objects or facts
and making sequences of logical deductions. We propose a two-stage
probabilistic inference paradigm, ThinkSum, which reasons over sets of objects
or facts in a structured manner. In the first stage (Think - retrieval of
associations), a LLM is queried in parallel over a set of phrases extracted
from the prompt or an auxiliary model call. In the second stage (Sum -
probabilistic inference or reasoning), the results of these queries are
aggregated to make the final prediction. We demonstrate the possibilities and
advantages of ThinkSum on the BIG-bench suite of LLM evaluation tasks,
achieving improvements over the state of the art using GPT-family models on
thirteen difficult tasks, often with far smaller model variants. We also
compare and contrast ThinkSum with other proposed modifications to direct
prompting of LLMs, such as variants of chain-of-thought prompting. Our results
suggest that because the probabilistic inference in ThinkSum is performed
outside of calls to the LLM, ThinkSum is less sensitive to prompt design,
yields more interpretable predictions, and can be flexibly combined with latent
variable models to extract structured knowledge from LLMs. Overall, our
proposed paradigm represents a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning

(or have the potential to) leverage color information. To promote advances in
such systems, we propose an efficient multi-modal keypoint detector that can
extract both geometry-salient and color-salient keypoints in colored point
clouds. The proposed CEntroid Distance (CED) keypoint detector comprises an
intuitive and effective saliency measure, the centroid distance, that can be
used in both 3D space and color space, and a multi-modal non-maximum
suppression algorithm that can select keypoints with high saliency in two or
more modalities. The proposed saliency measure leverages directly the
distribution of points in a local neighborhood and does not require normal
estimation or eigenvalue decomposition. We evaluate the proposed method in
terms of repeatability and computational efficiency (i.e. running time) against
state-of-the-art keypoint detectors on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Results demonstrate that our proposed CED keypoint detector requires minimal
computational time while attaining high repeatability. To showcase one of the
potential applications of the proposed method, we further investigate the task
of colored point cloud registration. Results suggest that our proposed CED

due to their prominent high-field properties. One of the central issues in
enhancing the critical current density of iron-based superconducting wires is
to reveal the roles and limitations of grain boundaries in supercurrent
transport. Here, we finely tuned the electronic properties of grain boundaries
by doping Ba1-xKxFe2As2 superconductors in a wide range (0.25<x<0.598). It is
found that the intra-grain Jcintra peaks near x~0.287, while the inter-grain
Jcinter has a maximum at about x~0.458. Remarkably, the grain boundary
transparency parameter defined as Jcinter/Jcintra rises monotonically with
doping. Through detailed microscopic analysis, we suggest that the FeAs
segregation phase commonly existing at grain boundaries and the adjacent grains
constitute superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) Josephson junctions
which play a key role in transporting supercurrent. A sandwich model based on
the proximity effect and the SNS junction is proposed to well interpret our
data. It is found that overdoping in superconducting grains largely strengthens

hardware devices. However, due to the high complexity of this problem, current
solutions can only work on circuits in fairly small scales (i.e. $<50$ qubits).
In this paper, we propose a qubit mapping methodology which, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first framework to handle very large quantum circuits (i.e.
thousands of qubits) towards the quantum advantage. Our novel routing
algorithm, Duostra, can efficiently identify the optimal routing path for a
given two-qubit gate to operate on physical qubits through swap-gate
insertions, and our scheduling heuristic offers the flexibility to strike the
balance in optimizing the performance and pursuing the scalability.
Experimental results show that our method runs $10$ times faster than the
state-of-the-art approaches, while on average can still outperform them by over
$5\%$ in terms of the execution time of the quantum circuits. More
specifically, our proposed algorithm can complete the qubit mapping of an

However, one key challenge of ultra-dense mmWave network (UDmmN) is beam
management due to the high propagation delay, limited beam coverage as well as
numerous beams and users. In this paper, a novel systematic beam control scheme
is presented to tackle the beam management problem which is difficult due to
the nonconvex objective function. We employ double deep Q-network (DDQN) under

the proposed beam management scheme based on FL (BMFL), the non-rawdata

Moreover, we propose to adopt a data cleaning technique in the local model

users while improving the learning convergence speed. Simulation results

Kelvin-Voigt, Maxwell, Kelvin-Zener and Poynting-Thomson. We also consider a
fractional quasi-linear version of Fung's model to account for stress/strain
nonlinearity. The fractional viscoelastic models are combined with a fractional
visco-plastic device, coupled with fractional viscoelastic models involving
serial combinations of Scott-Blair elements. We then develop a general
return-mapping procedure, which is fully implicit for linear viscoelastic
models, and semi-implicit for the quasi-linear case. We find that, in the
correction phase, the discrete stress projection and plastic slip have the same
form for all the considered models, although with different property and
time-step dependent projection terms. A series of numerical experiments is
carried out with analytical and reference solutions to demonstrate the
convergence and computational cost of the proposed framework, which is shown to
be at least first-order accurate for general loading conditions. Our numerical
results demonstrate that the developed framework is more flexible, preserves

MNFs. Moreover, MNFs need to be confined which is a weaker condition compared
to the Morse condition of DNFs. An MNF is composed of a confined function and
an attraction kernel. The critical points of the former can be confined in a
safe region around a target critical point. The collision-free trajectory of an
agent and its associations to its peers are governed by a confined function
before reaching its safe region. Then, the attraction kernel drives the agent
to its target in the safe region. MNFs provide faster coordination compared to
DNFs. We illustrate how MNFs may exhibit some social behaviors in the course of

it's still not sufficient to prevent privacy leakage from the training process
or the trained model. This paper focuses on studying the privacy-preserving
tree boosting algorithms under the vertical FL. The existing solutions based on
cryptography involve heavy computation and communication overhead and are
vulnerable to inference attacks. Although the solution based on Local
Differential Privacy (LDP) addresses the above problems, it leads to the low

  This paper explores to improve the accuracy of the widely deployed tree

Specifically, we introduce a framework called OpBoost. Three order-preserving
desensitization algorithms satisfying a variant of LDP called distance-based
LDP (dLDP) are designed to desensitize the training data. In particular, we
optimize the dLDP definition and study efficient sampling distributions to
further improve the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. The
proposed algorithms provide a trade-off between the privacy of pairs with large
distance and the utility of desensitized values. Comprehensive evaluations show
that OpBoost has a better performance on prediction accuracy of trained models

capacity-approaching irregular repeat accumulate (IRA) codes over integer rings
$\mathbb{Z}_{2^{m}}$ for $2^m$-PAM signaling, $m=1,2,\cdots$. Such codes
feature the property that the integer sum of $K$ codewords belongs to the
extended codebook (or lattice) w.r.t. the base code. With it, \emph{%
structured binning} can be utilized and the gains promised in lattice based
network information theory can be materialized in practice. In designing IRA
ring codes, we first analyze the effect of zero-divisors of integer ring on the
iterative belief-propagation (BP) decoding, and show the invalidity of
symmetric Gaussian approximation. Then we propose a doubly IRA (D-IRA) ring
code structure, consisting of \emph{irregular multiplier distribution} and
\emph{irregular node-degree distribution}, that can restore the symmetry and
optimize the BP decoding threshold. For point-to-point AWGN channel with $% 2^m
$-PAM inputs, D-IRA ring codes perform as low as 0.29 dB to the capacity
limits, outperforming existing bit-interleaved coded-modulation (BICM) and IRA
modulation codes over GF($2^m$). We then proceed to design D-IRA ring codes for
two important multi-user communication setups, namely compute-forward (CF) and
dirty paper coding (DPC), with $2^m$-PAM signaling. With it, a physical-layer
network coding scheme yields a gap to the CF limit by 0.24 dB, and a simple
linear DPC scheme exhibits a gap to the capacity by 0.91 dB.

explain something (e.g., data tables) to others. Very often, syntax of diagrams
is specified while the intended meaning of diagrammatic constructs remains
intuitive and approximate. Conceptual modeling has been developed to capture
concepts and their interactions with each other in the intended domain and to
represent structural and behavioral features of the modeled system. This paper
is a venture into diagrammatic approaches to the semantics of modeling
notations, with a focus on data and graph semantics. The first decade of the
new millennium has seen several new world-changing businesses spring to life
(e.g., Google and Twitter), that have put connected data at the center of their
trade. Harnessing such data requires significant effort and expertise, and it
quickly becomes prohibitively expensive. One solution involves building
graph-based data models, which is a challenging problem. In many applications,
the utilized software is managing not just objects as well as isolated and
discrete data items but also the connections between them. Data semantics is a
key ingredient to construct a model that explicitly describes the relationships
between data objects. In this paper, we claim that current ad hoc graphs that
attempt to provide semantics to data structures (e.g., relational tables and
tabular SQL) are problematic. These graphs mix static abstract concepts with
dynamic specification of objects (particulars). Such a claim is supported by
analysis that applies the thinging machine (TM) model to provide diagrammatic
representations of data (e.g., Neo4J graphs). The study s results show that to
take advantage of graph algorithms and simultaneously achieve appropriate data
semantics, the data graphs should be developed as simplified forms of TM.

proposed methods exploit the intrinsic low-rankness of the CPD formulation,
which is a result of the sparse scattering characteristics of mmWave channels,

sample complexity that scales quadratically with the sparsity of the cascade

the effective channel, this paper develops a joint active and passive
beamforming method based on the estimated cascade channels. Simulation results
show that the proposed CPD-based channel estimation methods attain mean square

reveals the kinematics of the diffuse gaseous component. We analyse the shape
of prominent emission lines in a sample of ~53,000 star-forming galaxies from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, focusing on departures from gaussianity.
Departures from a single gaussian profile allow us to probe the motion of gas
and to assess the role of outflows. The sample is divided into groups according
to their stellar velocity dispersion and star formation rate. The spectra
within each group are stacked to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the
emission lines, to remove individual signatures, and to enhance the effect of
star formation rate on the shapes of the emission lines. The moments of the
emission lines, including kurtosis and skewness, are determined. We find that
most of the emission lines in strong star-forming systems unequivocally feature
negative kurtosis. This signature is present in H$\beta$, H$\alpha$, [N II] and
[S II] in massive galaxies with high star formation rates. We attribute it as
evidence of radial outflows of ionised gas driven by the star formation of the
galaxies. Also, most of the emission lines in low-mass systems with high star
formation rates feature negative skewness, and we interpret it as evidence of
dust obscuration in the galactic disk. These signatures are however absent in
the [O III] line, which is believed to trace a different gas component. The
observed trend is significantly stronger in face-on galaxies, indicating that
star formation drives the outflows along the galactic rotation axis, presumably
the path of least resistance. The data suggest that outflows driven by star
formation exert accumulated impacts on the interstellar medium, and the outflow
signature is more evident in older galaxies as they have experienced a longer
total duration of star formation.

In order to expand the class of languages RNNs recognize, prior work has
augmented RNNs with a nondeterministic stack data structure, putting them on
par with pushdown automata and increasing their language recognition power to
CFLs. Nondeterminism is needed for recognizing all CFLs (not just deterministic
CFLs), but in this paper, we show that nondeterminism and the neural controller
interact to produce two more unexpected abilities. First, the nondeterministic

increase the information capacity in the stack and allow it to solve more

Furthermore, all the nonmetallic components involved are metabolized in large

each class from everything else. We argue that discriminative boundaries are
counter-intuitive as they define semantics by what-they-are-not; and should be
replaced by generative classifiers which define semantics by what-they-are.
Unfortunately, generative classifiers are significantly less accurate. This may
be caused by the tendency of generative models to focus on easy to model
semantic generative factors and ignore non-semantic factors that are important
but difficult to model. We propose a new generative model in which semantic
factors are accommodated by shell theory's hierarchical generative process and
non-semantic factors by an instance specific noise term. We use the model to
develop a classification scheme which suppresses the impact of noise while
preserving semantic cues. The result is a surprisingly accurate generative
classifier, that takes the form of a modified nearest-neighbor algorithm; we
term it distance classification. Unlike discriminative classifiers, a distance

elliptic (cnoidal) background standing wave for the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)
equation starting from a formula that is reminiscent of the classical Kay-Moses
formula for $N$-solitons. In particular, we represent such a solution as a sum
of the following two terms: a ``shifted"" elliptic (cnoidal) background wave and
a Kay-Moses type determinant containing Jacobi theta functions for the
solitonic content, which can be viewed as a collection of solitary disturbances
on the cnoidal background. The expressions for the traveling (group) speed of
these solitary disturbances, as well as for the interaction kernel describing
the scattering of pairs of such solitary disturbances, are obtained explicitly
in terms of Jacobi theta functions. We also show that genus $N+1$ finite gap
solutions with random initial phases converge in probability to the
deterministic cnoidal wave solution as $N$ bands degenerate to a nodal curve of
genus one. Finally, we derive the nonlinear dispersion relations and the
equation of states for the KdV soliton gas on the residual elliptic background.

  Compression","Proceedings of ICML 2023",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Layer-wise distillation is a powerful tool to compress large models (i.e.
teacher models) into small ones (i.e., student models). The student distills
knowledge from the teacher by mimicking the hidden representations of the
teacher at every intermediate layer. However, layer-wise distillation is
difficult. Since the student has a smaller model capacity than the teacher, it
is often under-fitted. Furthermore, the hidden representations of the teacher
contain redundant information that the student does not necessarily need for
the target task's learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Task-aware layEr-wise Distillation (TED). TED designs task-aware filters to
align the hidden representations of the student and the teacher at each layer.
The filters select the knowledge that is useful for the target task from the
hidden representations. As such, TED reduces the knowledge gap between the two
models and helps the student to fit better on the target task. We evaluate TED
in two scenarios: continual pre-training and fine-tuning. TED demonstrates
significant and consistent improvements over existing distillation methods in
both scenarios. Code is available at

point source is considered to originate from the Eta Carina ($\eta$ Car). We
further found the diffuse GeV $\gamma$-ray emission around the CNC which can be
modelled by two Gaussian disks with radii of 0.4\deg (region A) and 0.75\deg
(region B), respectively. The GeV $\gamma$-ray emission from both the regions A
and B have good spatial consistency with the derived molecular gas in
projection on the sky. The GeV $\gamma$-ray emission of region A reveals a
characteristic spectral shape of the pion-decay process, which indicates that
the $\gamma$-rays are produced by the interactions of hadronic cosmic rays with
ambient gas. The $\gamma$-rays spectrum of region B has a hard photon index of
2.12 $\pm$ 0.02, which is similar to other young massive star clusters. We
argue that the diffuse GeV $\gamma$-ray emission in region A and region B
likely originate from the interaction of accelerated protons in clusters with

multiple constraint functions, the problem of finding and tuning one or more
CBFs becomes more challenging, especially in the presence of input constraints.
This paper addresses this challenge by providing tools to 1) decouple the
design of multiple CBFs, so that a CBF can be designed for each constraint
function independently of other constraints, and 2) ensure that the set
composed from all the CBFs together is a viability domain. Thus, a quadratic
program subject to all the CBFs simultaneously is always feasible. The utility
of this methodology is then demonstrated in simulation for a nonlinear

shifts compared to the training distribution. While one line of work has
demonstrated that Simplicity Bias (SB) of DNNs - bias towards learning only the
simplest features - is a key reason for this brittleness, another recent line
of work has surprisingly found that diverse/ complex features are indeed
learned by the backbone, and their brittleness is due to the linear
classification head relying primarily on the simplest features. To bridge the
gap between these two lines of work, we first hypothesize and verify that while
SB may not altogether preclude learning complex features, it amplifies simpler
features over complex ones. Namely, simple features are replicated several
times in the learned representations while complex features might not be
replicated. This phenomenon, we term Feature Replication Hypothesis, coupled
with the Implicit Bias of SGD to converge to maximum margin solutions in the
feature space, leads the models to rely mostly on the simple features for
classification. To mitigate this bias, we propose Feature Reconstruction
Regularizer (FRR) to ensure that the learned features can be reconstructed back
from the logits. The use of {\em FRR} in linear layer training (FRR-L)
encourages the use of more diverse features for classification. We further
propose to finetune the full network by freezing the weights of the linear
layer trained using FRR-L, to refine the learned features, making them more
suitable for classification. Using this simple solution, we demonstrate up to
15% gains in OOD accuracy on the recently introduced semi-synthetic datasets
with extreme distribution shifts. Moreover, we demonstrate noteworthy gains
over existing SOTA methods on the standard OOD benchmark DomainBed as well.

  Scheduling","Accepted at VIPriors ECCVW 2022, camera-ready version",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  There are two de facto standard architectures in recent computer vision:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Strong
inductive biases of convolutions help the model learn sample effectively, but
such strong biases also limit the upper bound of CNNs when sufficient data are
available. On the contrary, ViT is inferior to CNNs for small data but superior
for sufficient data. Recent approaches attempt to combine the strengths of
these two architectures. However, we show these approaches overlook that the
optimal inductive bias also changes according to the target data scale changes
by comparing various models' accuracy on subsets of sampled ImageNet at
different ratios. In addition, through Fourier analysis of feature maps, the
model's response patterns according to signal frequency changes, we observe
which inductive bias is advantageous for each data scale. The more
convolution-like inductive bias is included in the model, the smaller the data
scale is required where the ViT-like model outperforms the ResNet performance.
To obtain a model with flexible inductive bias on the data scale, we show
reparameterization can interpolate inductive bias between convolution and
self-attention. By adjusting the number of epochs the model stays in the
convolution, we show that reparameterization from convolution to self-attention
interpolates the Fourier analysis pattern between CNNs and ViTs. Adapting these
findings, we propose Progressive Reparameterization Scheduling (PRS), in which
reparameterization adjusts the required amount of convolution-like or
self-attention-like inductive bias per layer. For small-scale datasets, our PRS
performs reparameterization from convolution to self-attention linearly faster
at the late stage layer. PRS outperformed previous studies on the small-scale
dataset, e.g., CIFAR-100.

stabilizing an originally (partially) unknown system while ensuring that it
does not leave a prescribed 'safe set' - has recently received tremendous
attention in the controls community. Further complexities arise, however, when
the structure of the safe set itself depends on the unknown part of the
system's dynamics. In particular, a popular approach based on control Lyapunov
functions (CLF), control barrier functions (CBF) and Gaussian processes (to
build confidence set around the unknown term), which has proved successful in
the known-safe set setting, becomes inefficient as-is, due to the introduction
of higher-order terms to be estimated and bounded with high probability using
only system state measurements. In this paper, we build on the recent
literature on GPs and reproducing kernels to perform this latter task, and show
how to correspondingly modify the CLF-CBF-based approach to obtain safety
guarantees. Namely, we derive exponential CLF and second relative order
exponential CBF constraints whose satisfaction guarantees stability and forward
in-variance of the partially unknown safe set with high probability. To
overcome the intractability of verification of these conditions on the
continuous domain, we apply discretization of the state space and use Lipschitz
continuity properties of dynamics to derive equivalent CLF and CBF certificates
in discrete state space. Finally, we present an algorithm for the control

the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and experimental results, and it
exhibits higher accuracy than classical potentials. Based on the
high-temperature lattice dynamics study, we first present the
temperature-pressure range in which the Kohn anomalous behavior of the
${\Sigma}$4 optical mode exists. Phonon spectral function analysis showed that
the phonon anharmonicity of alpha-U is very weak. We predict that the

cutting potatoes in a cooking tutorial). We argue that such noise is common in
real world data and term them ""extraneous"" segments. To tackle this problem, we
introduce Extraneousness-Aware Imitation Learning (EIL), a self-supervised
approach that learns visuomotor policies from third-person demonstrations with
extraneous subsequences. EIL learns action-conditioned observation embeddings

quantum information processing that have recently been investigated by Irani,
Natarajan, Nirkhe, Rao and Yuen [CCC 2022] and Rosenthal and Yuen [ITCS 2022]
under the term \emph{state synthesis}. This paper studies this concept from the
viewpoint of quantum distributed computing, and especially distributed quantum
Merlin-Arthur (dQMA) protocols. We first introduce a novel task, on a line,
called state generation with distributed inputs (SGDI). In this task, the goal
is to generate the quantum state $U\ket{\psi}$ at the rightmost node of the
line, where $\ket{\psi}$ is a quantum state given at the leftmost node and $U$
is a unitary matrix whose description is distributed over the nodes of the
line. We give a dQMA protocol for SGDI and utilize this protocol to construct a
dQMA protocol for the Set Equality problem studied by Naor, Parter and Yogev
[SODA 2020]. Our second contribution is a technique, based on a recent work by
Zhu and Hayashi [Physical Review A, 2019], to create EPR-pairs between adjacent
nodes of a network without quantum communication. As an application of this
technique, we prove a general result showing how to convert any dQMA protocol
on an arbitrary network into another dQMA protocol where the verification stage
does not require any quantum communication.

Saxena [PODC 2018] as a generalization of distributed decision mechanisms
(proof-labeling schemes, etc.), and has received a lot of attention in recent
years. In distributed interactive proofs, the nodes of an $n$-node network $G$
can exchange short messages (called certificates) with a powerful prover. The
goal is to decide if the input (including $G$ itself) belongs to some language,
with as few turns of interaction and as few bits exchanged between nodes and
the prover as possible. There are several results showing that the size of
certificates can be reduced drastically with a constant number of interactions
compared to non-interactive distributed proofs. In this paper, we introduce the
quantum counterpart of distributed interactive proofs: certificates can now be
quantum bits, and the nodes of the network can perform quantum computation. The
first result of this paper shows that by using quantum distributed interactive
proofs, the number of interactions can be significantly reduced. More
precisely, our result shows that for any constant~$k$, the class of languages
that can be decided by a $k$-turn classical (i.e., non-quantum) distributed
interactive protocol with $f(n)$-bit certificate size is contained in the class
of languages that can be decided by a $5$-turn distributed quantum interactive
protocol with $O(f(n))$-bit certificate size. We also show that if we allow to
use shared randomness, the number of turns can be reduced to 3-turn. Since no
similar turn-reduction \emph{classical} technique is currently known, our
result gives evidence of the power of quantum computation in the setting of
distributed interactive proofs as well.

usually uses 3D point clouds as input in conventional setups. Recently, there
is a trend of leveraging multiple sources of input data, such as complementing
the 3D point cloud with 2D images that often have richer color and fewer
noises. However, due to the heterogeneous geometrics of the 2D and 3D
representations, it prevents us from applying off-the-shelf neural networks to
achieve multimodal fusion. To that end, we propose Bridged Transformer (BrT),
an end-to-end architecture for 3D object detection. BrT is simple and
effective, which learns to identify 3D and 2D object bounding boxes from both
points and image patches. A key element of BrT lies in the utilization of
object queries for bridging 3D and 2D spaces, which unifies different sources
of data representations in Transformer. We adopt a form of feature aggregation
realized by point-to-patch projections which further strengthen the
correlations between images and points. Moreover, BrT works seamlessly for
fusing the point cloud with multi-view images. We experimentally show that BrT
surpasses state-of-the-art methods on SUN RGB-D and ScanNetV2 datasets.

gravitational dynamics using deep nets in feedforward gravity compensation
control for high-DOF master manipulators with unknown disturbance. In
particular, Feedforward Deep Neural Networks (FDNNs) are learned from both
prior knowledge of an existing analytical model and observation of the robot
system by Knowledge Distillation (KD). Through extensive experiments in
high-DOF master manipulators with significant disturbance, we show that our
method surpasses a standard Learning-from-Scratch (LfS) approach in terms of
data efficiency and disturbance adaptation. Our initial feasibility study has
demonstrated the potential of outperforming the analytical teacher model as the

Commun. Phys. $\bm 5$, 39\ (2022) (at

time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$)-symmetry-broken polar superconductors. The
anapole moment was shown to arise from the asymmetric Bogoliubov spectrum,
which induces a finite center of mass momenta of Cooper pairs at the zero
magnetic field. In this paper, we show an alternative mechanism of anapole
superconductivity: the quantum geometry induces the anapole moment when the
interband pairing and Berry connection are finite. Thus, the anapole
superconductivity is a ubiquitous feature of $\mathcal{T}$-broken multiband
polar superconductors. Applying the theory to a minimal model of UTe$_2$, we
demonstrate the quantum-geometry-induced anapole superconductivity.
Furthermore, we show the Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFS) in an anapole
superconducting state and predict an unusual temperature dependence of BFS due
to the quantum geometry. Experimental verification of these phenomena may
clarify the superconducting state in UTe$_2$ and reveal the ubiquitous
importance of quantum geometry in exotic superconductors.

a major impact in the analysis of political redistricting, including in U.S.
courts of law. Mathematically, a districting plan can be viewed as a balanced
partition of a graph into connected subsets. Examining a large sample of valid
alternative districting plans can help us recognize gerrymandering against an
appropriate neutral baseline. One algorithm that is widely used to produce
random samples of districting plans is a Markov chain called recombination (or
ReCom), which repeatedly fuses adjacent districts, forms a spanning tree of
their union, and splits that spanning tree with a balanced cut to form new
districts. One drawback is that this chain's stationary distribution has no
known closed form when there are three or more districts. In this paper, we
modify ReCom slightly to give it a property called reversibility, resulting in
a new Markov chain, RevReCom. This new chain converges to the simple, natural
distribution that ReCom was originally designed to approximate: a plan's
stationary probability is proportional to the product of the number of spanning
trees of each district. This spanning tree score is a measure of district
""compactness"" (or shape) that is also aligned with notions of community
structure from network science. After deriving the steady state formally, we
present diagnostic evidence that the convergence is efficient enough for the
method to be practically useful, giving high-quality samples for full-sized
problems within several hours. In addition to the primary application of
benchmarking of redistricting plans (i.e., describing a normal range for
statistics), this chain can also be used to validate other methods that target
the spanning tree distribution.

frequencies opaque materials, to measure the local solids velocity and the
reflected radar power with a spatial resolution of a few cubic centimetres over
distances of a few metres. This paper introduces a method to relate the
received radar signal power to the solids volumetric concentrations (cv) of
different particulate materials. The experimental set-up provides a steady
stream of free-falling solids that consist of glass spheres, bronze spheres or
natural sand grains with known particle size distributions and with particle
diameters in the range of 50-300 $\mu$m. Thus, the values of cv found using the
radar measurements are validated using the values of cv retrieved from closure
of the mass balance derived from the measured mass flow rate of the solids
stream and the solids velocity. The results show that the radar system provides
reliable measurements of cv, with a mean relative error of approximately 25%
for all the tested materials, particle sizes and mass flow rates, yielding
values of cv ranging from 0.2x10$^{-4}$ m$^{3}$/ m$^{3}$ up to 40x10$^{-4}$
m$^{3}$/ m$^{3}$ and solids velocities within the range of 0-4.5 m/s. This
demonstrates the ability of the radar technology to diagnose the solids flow in
gas-solids suspensions using a unique combination of penetration length,
accuracy, and spatial and velocity resolution.

smart phones and smart home devices presents new challenges to cloud computing
in transferring, storing, and processing the data. With increasingly more
powerful edge devices, edge computing, on the other hand, has the potential to
better responsiveness, privacy, and cost efficiency. However, resources across
the cloud and edge are highly distributed and highly diverse. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes EdgeFaaS, a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) based
computing framework that supports the flexible, convenient, and optimized use
of distributed and heterogeneous resources across IoT, edge, and cloud systems.
EdgeFaaS allows cluster resources and individual devices to be managed under
the same framework and provide computational and storage resources for
functions. It provides virtual function and virtual storage interfaces for
consistent function management and storage management across heterogeneous
compute and storage resources. It automatically optimizes the scheduling of
functions and placement of data according to their performance and privacy
requirements. EdgeFaaS is evaluated based on two edge workflows: video
analytics workflow and federated learning workflow, both of which are
representative edge applications and involve large amounts of input data

the order of $O\{(nh_0)^{-1/2}+h_0^L\}=O(n^{-L/(2L+1)})$ for a bandwidth $h_0$

high enough. We also provide the valid Edgeworth expansion up to the order of
$O\{(nh_0)^{-1}+h_0^{2L}\}$ and find that, as long as the $L_p$ is high enough
, the plug-in method has an effect from on the term whose convergence rate is
$O\{(nh_0)^{-1/2}h_0+h_0^{L+1}\}=O(n^{-(L+1)/(2L+1)})$. In other words, we
derive the exact achievable convergence rate of the deviation between the
distribution functions of the estimator with a deterministic bandwidth and with
the plug-in bandwidth. In addition, we weaken the conditions on kernel order
$L_p$ for pilot estimation by considering the effect of pilot bandwidth
associated with the plug-in bandwidth. We also show that the bandwidth

robot's goal from a robot motion trajectory. When generating such trajectories,
existing planners often rely on an observer model that estimates the quality of
trajectory candidates. These observer models are frequently hand-crafted or,
occasionally, learned from demonstrations. Here, we propose to learn them in a
supervised manner using the same data format that is frequently used during the
evaluation of aforementioned approaches. We then demonstrate the generality of
SLOT-V using a Franka Emika in a simulated manipulation environment. For this,
we show that it can learn to closely predict various hand-crafted observer
models, i.e., that SLOT-V's hypothesis space encompasses existing handcrafted
models. Next, we showcase SLOT-V's ability to generalize by showing that a
trained model continues to perform well in environments with unseen goal
configurations and/or goal counts. Finally, we benchmark SLOT-V's sample
efficiency (and performance) against an existing IRL approach and show that
SLOT-V learns better observer models with less data. Combined, these results
suggest that SLOT-V can learn viable observer models. Better observer models
imply more legible trajectories, which may - in turn - lead to better and more

atmospheric density and composition were carried out by the Viking lander

spectrometers and other related payloads. Using near-simultaneous observations
by the two orbiters, it is seen that both data sets indicate significant
day-to-day variations of Argon density profiles in the thermosphere-exosphere,
150-300 km region, during the period 1-15, June 2018, when the solar EUV
radiation did not show any appreciable change but the solar wind energetic
particle fluxes did so. Extending this study to include the other parent
atmospheric constituents carbon dioxide, helium, nitrogen and their
photochemical products atomic oxygen, and carbon monoxide during the same
period it is found that the density profiles of carbon dioxide and atomic
oxygen also show similar variations with carbon dioxide densities showing an
increasing trend similar to Argon, but a reversal of this trend for atomic
oxygen densities. Using insitu and near simultaneous measurements of solar EUV
fluxes and the solar wind plasma velocities and densities near MAVEN periapsis
it is noted that, unlike the solar EUV radiation, solar wind parameters showed
a decrease by a factor of 2-3. Hence, it is inferred that the energetic and
penetrating solar wind charged particle impact-driven dissociation, ionisation
and ion-chemical processes could decrease the carbon dioxide densities leading
to an increase in atomic oxygen densities. This result is also discussed from
the considerations of the proton gyro radius effect, pickup ions, sputtering,
energetic neutral atoms driven ionisation and ion losses. Further data and

suffer from hallucination problems due to their negligence of the structural
information contained in the sentence, which essentially constitutes the key
semantics of the logical forms. Furthermore, most works treat PLM as a black
box in which the generation process of the target logical form is hidden
beneath the decoder modules, which greatly hinders the model's intrinsic

current PLMs with a hierarchical decoder network. By taking the first-principle
structures as the semantic anchors, we propose two novel intermediate

Alignment, for training the hierarchical decoders and probing the model
intermediate representations in a self-adaptive manner alongside the
fine-tuning process. We conduct intensive experiments on several semantic

outperform the baselines. More importantly, by analyzing the intermediate

continuous domains have been proposed. However, the inherent high branching
factor and the resulting explosion of search tree size is limiting existing
methods. To solve this problem, this paper proposes Continuous Monte Carlo
Graph Search (CMCGS), a novel extension of MCTS to online planning in
environments with continuous state and action spaces. CMCGS takes advantage of
the insight that, during planning, sharing the same action policy between
several states can yield high performance. To implement this idea, at each time
step CMCGS clusters similar states into a limited number of stochastic action
bandit nodes, which produce a layered graph instead of an MCTS search tree.
Experimental evaluation with limited sample budgets shows that CMCGS
outperforms comparison methods in several complex continuous DeepMind Control

interactions of tokens are restrained in dense regions. Obviously, this
strategy could result in restricted receptive fields. To address this issue, we
propose Attention Retractable Transformer (ART) for image restoration, which
presents both dense and sparse attention modules in the network. The sparse
attention module allows tokens from sparse areas to interact and thus provides
a wider receptive field. Furthermore, the alternating application of dense and

while providing retractable attention on the input image.We conduct extensive

average system throughput by optimizing the communication and sensing
beamforming as well as UAV trajectory while guaranteeing the quality-of-service

non-convex optimization problem, we first propose an efficient alternating
optimization algorithm to optimize the communication and sensing beamforming
for a given UAV location, and then develop a low-complexity joint beamforming

optimal UAV location until reaching the final location. Numerical results
validate the superiority of the proposed adaptable mechanism and the

captured using a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor guided by a pair of
stereo images. Generally, conventional stereo-aided depth completion methods
have two limiations. (i) They assume the given sparse depth map is accurately
aligned to the input image, whereas the alignment is difficult to achieve in
practice. (ii) They have limited accuracy in the long range because the depth
is estimated by pixel disparity. To solve the abovementioned limitations, we
propose selective stereo matching (SSM) that searches the most appropriate
depth value for each image pixel from its neighborly projected LiDAR points
based on an energy minimization framework. This depth selection approach can
handle any type of mis-projection. Moreover, SSM has an advantage in terms of
long-range depth accuracy because it directly uses the LiDAR measurement rather
than the depth acquired from the stereo. SSM is a discrete process; thus, we
apply variational smoothing with binary anisotropic diffusion tensor (B-ADT) to
generate a continuous depth map while preserving depth discontinuity across
object boundaries. Experimentally, compared with the previous state-of-the-art
stereo-aided depth completion, the proposed method reduced the mean absolute
error (MAE) of the depth estimation to 0.65 times and demonstrated
approximately twice more accurate estimation in the long range. Moreover, under
various LiDAR-camera calibration errors, the proposed method reduced the depth
estimation MAE to 0.34-0.93 times from previous depth completion methods.

historical global model to construct an estimator based on which the local
models will be filtered through similarity detection. We then cluster local
models to adaptively adjust the acceptable differences between the local models
and the estimator such that Byzantine users can be identified. Extensive
experiments over different datasets show that our approach achieves the

fine-grained categories with the help of limited available samples.
Undoubtedly, this task inherits the main challenges from both few-shot learning
and fine-grained recognition. First, the lack of labeled samples makes the
learned model easy to overfit. Second, it also suffers from high intra-class
variance and low inter-class differences in the datasets. To address this
challenging task, we propose a two-stage background suppression and foreground
alignment framework, which is composed of a background activation suppression
(BAS) module, a foreground object alignment (FOA) module, and a local-to-local
(L2L) similarity metric. Specifically, the BAS is introduced to generate a
foreground mask for localization to weaken background disturbance and enhance
dominative foreground objects. The FOA then reconstructs the feature map of
each support sample according to its correction to the query ones, which
addresses the problem of misalignment between support-query image pairs. To
enable the proposed method to have the ability to capture subtle differences in
confused samples, we present a novel L2L similarity metric to further measure
the local similarity between a pair of aligned spatial features in the
embedding space. What's more, considering that background interference brings
poor robustness, we infer the pairwise similarity of feature maps using both
the raw image and the refined image. Extensive experiments conducted on
multiple popular fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate that our method

effect qualitatively. The LDOS inside the barrier has the information on the
electrodes and the electron tunneling through the barrier, which enables us to
easily evaluate the tunneling conductance more precisely than the conventional
Julliere's picture. We then apply this method to the MTJs with collinear
ferrimagnets and antiferromagnets. We find that the TMR effect in the
ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic MTJs changes depending on the interfacial
magnetic structures originating from the sublattice structure, which can also
be captured by the LDOS. Our findings will reduce the computational cost for

A monotonic, functional representation exploits the spatio-temporal

Emulators, features that parameterise the climb are mapped directly to
functional outputs, providing a fast approximation, while ensuring that the
resulting trajectory is monotonic. The model was applied as a probabilistic

important yet challenging task in artificial embodied agent creation. Previous
systems mainly focus on generating gestures in an end-to-end manner, which
leads to difficulties in mining the clear rhythm and semantics due to the
complex yet subtle harmony between speech and gestures. We present a novel
co-speech gesture synthesis method that achieves convincing results both on the
rhythm and semantics. For the rhythm, our system contains a robust rhythm-based
segmentation pipeline to ensure the temporal coherence between the vocalization
and gestures explicitly. For the gesture semantics, we devise a mechanism to
effectively disentangle both low- and high-level neural embeddings of speech
and motion based on linguistic theory. The high-level embedding corresponds to
semantics, while the low-level embedding relates to subtle variations. Lastly,
we build correspondence between the hierarchical embeddings of the speech and
the motion, resulting in rhythm- and semantics-aware gesture synthesis.
Evaluations with existing objective metrics, a newly proposed rhythmic metric,
and human feedback show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art systems by
a clear margin.

determining the distribution of magnetization in crystals. Applications of the
two techniques proceed by contrasting observed intensities with intensities
calculated with a specific model, and changing the model as need be to achieve
satisfactory agreement. An all-in-all-out (AIAO) magnetic configuration of
magnetic dipoles on a cubic face-centred lattice with networks of
corner-sharing tetrahedra is often mentioned in the context of pyrochlore
oxides, for example, but the corresponding neutron and x-ray diffraction
patterns appear not have been calculated. Our results for patterns of Bragg
spots from an AIAO magnetic configuration defined by a magnetic space group are
symmetry informed and yield exact reflection conditions. Specifically, a
long-range order of magnetic dipoles is forbidden in our model. Bulk properties
arise from higher-order multipoles that include quadrupoles and octupoles.
Bragg spots that exclude all magnetic multipoles other than an octupole have
been discovered, and they can be observed by both neutron diffraction and
resonant x-ray diffraction. All magnetic multipoles allowed in diffraction by
cerium ions (4f1) are presented in terms of coefficients in a well-documented
and unusual magnetic ground state. Symmetry of the cerium site in the cubic
structure constrains the coefficients. Our scattering amplitudes have an
application in both neutron and x-ray diffraction experiments on Ce2Zr2O7, for
example, and searches for the sought-after cerium octupole. Also presented for
future use is a result for the total, energy-integrated magnetic neutron
scattering intensity by a powder sample.

high observed energies (i.e., energies larger than the peak temperature scale
of the disc) is derived, under the assumption that the temperature fluctuations
are log-normally distributed. Thin disc theory is used throughout. While
log-normal temperature fluctuations would imply that the disc's bolometric
luminosity is also log-normal, the observed Wien-like luminosity behaves very
differently. For example, in contrast to a log-normal distribution, the
standard deviation of the derived distribution is not linearly proportional to
its mean. This means that these systems do not follow a linear rms-flux
relationship. Instead they exhibit very high intrinsic variance, and undergo
what amounts to a phase transition, in which the mode of the distribution (in
the statistical sense) ceases to exist, even for physically reasonable values
of the underlying temperature variance. The moments of this distribution are
derived using asymptotic expansion techniques. A result that is important for
interpreting observations is that the theory predicts that the fractional
variability of these disc systems should increase as the observed frequency is
increased. The derived distribution will be of practical utility in
quantitatively understanding the variability of disc systems observed at
energies above their peak temperature scale, including X-ray observations of
tidal disruption events.

We first formulate this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). Then we

Furthermore, a horizontal federated reinforcement learning (HFRL)-based method
is proposed to fit various users' behaviors and dynamic environments. This
approach can learn an optimal charging/discharging control strategy without

(XUV) radiation. This study explores the fundamental question of whether the
atmosphere of present-day Earth could survive in such harsh XUV environments.
Previous theoretical studies suggest that stellar XUV irradiation is
sufficiently intense to remove such atmospheres completely on short timescales.
In this study, we develop a new upper-atmospheric model and re-examine the
thermal and hydrodynamic responses of the thermospheric structure of an
Earth-like N2-O2 atmosphere, on an Earth-mass planet, to an increase in the XUV
irradiation. Our model includes the effects of radiative cooling via electronic
transitions of atoms and ions, known as atomic line cooling, in addition to the
processes accounted for by previous models. We demonstrate that atomic line
cooling dominates over the hydrodynamic effect at XUV irradiation levels
greater than several times the present level of the Earth. Consequentially, the
atmosphere's structure is kept almost hydrostatic, and its escape remains
sluggish even at XUV irradiation levels up to a thousand times that of the
Earth at present. Our estimates for the Jeans escape rates of N2-O2 atmospheres
suggest that these 1 bar atmospheres survive in early active phases of Sun-like
stars. Even around active late M dwarfs, N2-O2 atmospheres could escape
significant thermal loss on timescales of gigayears. These results give new
insights into the habitability of terrestrial exoplanets and the Earth's

atmospheric motions. We thus conclude that the coupling between radiation and
dynamics alone is not sufficient to explain the abnormal large radii of

  from Multimodal MRI","under review",,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays an important role in diagnosing the
parotid tumor, where accurate segmentation of tumors is highly desired for
determining appropriate treatment plans and avoiding unnecessary surgery.
However, the task remains nontrivial and challenging due to ambiguous
boundaries and various sizes of the tumor, as well as the presence of a large
number of anatomical structures around the parotid gland that are similar to
the tumor. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel anatomy-aware
framework for automatic segmentation of parotid tumors from multimodal MRI.
First, a Transformer-based multimodal fusion network PT-Net is proposed in this
paper. The encoder of PT-Net extracts and fuses contextual information from
three modalities of MRI from coarse to fine, to obtain cross-modality and
multi-scale tumor information. The decoder stacks the feature maps of different
modalities and calibrates the multimodal information using the channel
attention mechanism. Second, considering that the segmentation model is prone
to be disturbed by similar anatomical structures and make wrong predictions, we
design anatomy-aware loss. By calculating the distance between the activation
regions of the prediction segmentation and the ground truth, our loss function
forces the model to distinguish similar anatomical structures with the tumor
and make correct predictions. Extensive experiments with MRI scans of the
parotid tumor showed that our PT-Net achieved higher segmentation accuracy than
existing networks. The anatomy-aware loss outperformed state-of-the-art loss
functions for parotid tumor segmentation. Our framework can potentially improve
the quality of preoperative diagnosis and surgery planning of parotid tumors.

whether she prefers a route with a travel time that has a relatively low mean

the routing decision typically does not take into account the uncertainty in
the estimates of the travel time's mean and variance. This paper aims at
resolving both issues by setting up a framework for travel time estimation. In
our framework, the underlying road network is represented as a graph. Each edge
is subdivided into multiple smaller pieces, so as to naturally model the
statistical similarity between road pieces that are spatially nearby. Relying
on a Bayesian approach, we construct an estimator for the joint per-edge travel
time distribution, thus also providing us with an uncertainty quantification of
our estimates. Our machinery relies on establishing limit theorems, making the

Non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce disease transmission significantly,
but interventions also have considerable societal costs. Therefore,
decision-makers need near real-time information to calibrate the level of
restrictions. We fielded daily surveys in Denmark during the second wave of the
COVID-19 pandemic to monitor public response to the announced lockdown. A key
question asked respondents to state their number of close contacts within the
past 24 hours. Here, we establish a link between survey data, mobility data,

evaluate the usefulness of survey responses as a tool to monitor the effects of
lockdown and then compare the predictive performance to that of mobility data.
We find that, unlike mobility, self-reported contacts decreased significantly
in all regions before the nation-wide implementation of non-pharmaceutical
interventions and improved predicting future hospitalizations compared to
mobility data. A detailed analysis of contact types indicates that contact with
friends and strangers outperforms contact with colleagues and family members
(outside the household) on the same prediction task. Representative surveys
thus qualify as a reliable, non-privacy invasive monitoring tool to track the
implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions and study potential
transmission paths.

general, the spiral arms rotate at a different pattern speed to that of the
bar. The main conclusion from the bibliography is that the bar rotates faster
than the spiral arms with a double or even a triple value of angular velocity.
The theory that prevails in explaining the formation of the spiral arms in the
case of a barred spiral galaxy with two pattern speeds is the manifold theory,
where the orbits that support the spiral density wave are chaotic, and are
related to the manifolds emanating from the Lagrangian points L_1 and L_2 at
the end of the bar. In the present study, we consider an alternative scenario
in the case where the bar rotates fast enough in comparison with the spiral
arms and the bar potential can be considered as a perturbation of the spiral
potential. In this case, the stable elliptical orbits that support the spiral
density wave (in the case of grand design galaxies) are transformed into
quasiperiodic orbits (or 2D tori) with a certain thickness. The superposition
of these perturbed preccesing ellipses for all the energy levels of the
Hamiltonian creates a slightly perturbed symmetrical spiral density wave.

been extensively studied in planar magnetic strips (planar nanowires), few
reports exist in cylindrical geometry, where Bloch point domain walls are
expected to have intriguing properties. Here we report this investigation in
cylindrical magnetic Ni nanowires with geometrical notches. Experimental work
based on synchrotron X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) combined with
photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) indicates that large current densities
induce domain wall nucleation while smaller currents move domain walls
preferably against the current direction. In the region where no pinning
centers are present we found domain wall velocity of about 1 km/s. The domain
wall motion along current was also detected in the vicinity of the notch
region. Pinning of domain walls has been observed not only at geometrical
constrictions but also outside of them. Thermal modelling indicates that large
current densities temporarily raise the temperature in the nanowire above the
Curie temperature leading to nucleation of domain walls during the system
cooling. Micromagnetic modelling with spin-torque effect shows that for
intermediate current densities Bloch point domain walls with chirality parallel
to the Oersted field propagate antiparallel to the current direction. In other
cases, domain walls can be bounced from the notches and/or get pinned outside
their positions. We thus find that current is not only responsible for the
domain wall propagation but is also a source of pinning due to the Oersted
field action.

contextual attention from different views. In this way, we can filter out the
redundant feature information and mitigate the loss of critical information for
small lesions in 3D scans. Then we utilize a dimension hybridization strategy
to fuse the 3D features with attention from different axes and merge them by a
weighted summation to adaptively learn the importance of different
perspectives. Finally, in the APA Decoder, we concatenate both high and low

affective communication, allowing people across the world a wider specter of
emotional and social exchanges over traditional 2D and 3D image data. However,
there are several limitations of current telepresence robots, such as the high
weight, complexity of the system that prevents its fast deployment, and the
limited workspace of the avatars mounted on either static or wheeled mobile
platforms.
  In this paper, we present a novel concept of telecommunication through a
robot avatar based on an anthropomorphic swarm of drones; SwarMan. The
developed system consists of nine nanocopters controlled remotely by the
operator through a gesture recognition interface. SwarMan allows operators to
communicate by directly following their motions and by recognizing one of the
prerecorded emotional patterns, thus rendering the captured emotion as
illumination on the drones. The LSTM MediaPipe network was trained on a
collected dataset of 600 short videos with five emotional gestures. The
accuracy of achieved emotion recognition was 97% on the test dataset.
  As communication through the swarm avatar significantly changes the visual
appearance of the operator, we investigated the ability of the users to
recognize and respond to emotions performed by the swarm of drones. The
experimental results revealed a high consistency between the users in rating
emotions. Additionally, users indicated low physical demand (2.25 on the Likert
scale) and were satisfied with their performance (1.38 on the Likert scale)
when communicating by the SwarMan interface.

Next, we discuss nonlinear generative models in which the partial correlations

develop algorithms for inferring the model parameters and core scores of a

Scientists have only recently started to develop forecasting tools, despite
their importance in urban planning, transportation planning, and epidemic
spreading modeling. Here, we build a fully interpretable statistical model
that, incorporating only the minimum number of constraints, can predict
different phenomena arising in the city. Using data on the movements of
car-sharing vehicles in different Italian cities, we infer a model using the
Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) principle. With it, we describe the activity in
different city zones and apply it to activity forecasting and anomaly detection
(e.g., strikes, and bad weather conditions). We compare our method with
different models explicitly made for forecasting: SARIMA models and Deep
Learning Models. We find that MaxEnt models are highly predictive,
outperforming SARIMAs and having similar results as a Neural Network. These
results show how relevant statistical inference can be in building a robust and
general model describing urban systems phenomena. This article identifies the
significant observables for processes happening in the city, with the
perspective of a deeper understanding of the fundamental forces driving its

transport for thermal absorption and emission by the dust and gas. We start
from a collapsing cloud core that is threaded by an initially-uniform magnetic
field and which is slowly rotating. We utilize a two-dimensional axisymmetric
grid in spherical coordinates. In the simulations, we can clearly distinguish a
fast, magneto-centrifugally launched and collimated jet (of speeds > 100 km/s),
from a wider magnetic tower flow driven by magnetic pressure which broadens in

volume method on unstructured triangular grids. A special piecewise linear
reconstruction of the solution is implemented with a correction technique to
ensure the accuracy of the method and the positivity of the computed water

well-balanced formulation for the bottom topography are used to exactly
preserve stationary steady-state s solutions. Moreover, we prove that the

validate the proposed numerical model against experiments, we first demonstrate
its ability to preserve nontrivial steady-state solutions and then we model

period of time. It is a challenging task to predict spatiotemporal sequence
because the spatiotemporal sequence varies both in time and space. The
mainstream method is to model spatial and temporal structures at the same time
using RNN-based or transformer-based architecture, and then generates future
data by using learned experience in the way of auto-regressive. The method of
learning spatial and temporal features simultaneously brings a lot of
parameters to the model, which makes the model difficult to be convergent. In
this paper, a modular design is proposed, which decomposes spatiotemporal
sequence model into two modules: a spatial encoder-decoder and a predictor.
These two modules can extract spatial features and predict future data
respectively. The spatial encoder-decoder maps the data into a latent embedding
space and generates data from the latent space while the predictor forecasts
future embedding from past. By applying the design to the current research and
performing experiments on KTH-Action and MovingMNIST datasets, we both improve

in high dimensions. An appealing hypothesis is that they achieve this feat by
building a representation of the data where information irrelevant to the task
is lost. For image datasets, this view is supported by the observation that
after (and not before) training, the neural representation becomes less and
less sensitive to diffeomorphisms acting on images as the signal propagates
through the net. This loss of sensitivity correlates with performance, and
surprisingly correlates with a gain of sensitivity to white noise acquired
during training. These facts are unexplained, and as we demonstrate still hold
when white noise is added to the images of the training set. Here, we (i) show
empirically for various architectures that stability to image diffeomorphisms
is achieved by both spatial and channel pooling, (ii) introduce a model
scale-detection task which reproduces our empirical observations on spatial
pooling and (iii) compute analitically how the sensitivity to diffeomorphisms
and noise scales with depth due to spatial pooling. The scalings are found to
depend on the presence of strides in the net architecture. We find that the
increased sensitivity to noise is due to the perturbing noise piling up during
pooling, after being rectified by ReLU units.

produce equal accelerations, while the total momentum is conserved. The second

we investigate domain coupling in BaTiO$_3$(111)/CoFeB heterostructures by
direct imaging in a wide-field Kerr microscope. The magnetic easy axis is found
to locally change direction as a result of the underlying ferroelectric domains
and their polarisation. By plotting the remanent magnetisation as a function of
angle in the plane of the CoFeB layer, we find that the magnetic easy axes in
adjacent domains are angled at 60$^\circ$ or 120$^\circ$, corresponding to the
angle of rotation of the polarisation from one ferroelectric domain to the
next, and that the magnetic domain walls may be charged or uncharged depending
on the magnetic field history. Micromagnetic simulations show that the
properties of the domain walls vary depending on the magnetoelastic easy axis
configuration and the charged or uncharged nature of the wall. The
configuration where the easy axis alternates by 60$^\circ$ and a charged wall
is initialised exhibits the largest change in domain wall width from 192 nm to

with an easy access to their products by structuring them in catalogues using
navigation bars and providing recommendations. We refer to these catalogues as
product concepts, e.g. product categories on e-commerce websites, public
playlists on music streaming platforms. These product concepts typically
contain products that are linked with each other through some common features
(e.g. a playlist of songs by the same artist). How they are defined in the

represent product concepts using database queries and tackle two learning
problems. First, given sets of products that all belong to the same unknown
product concept, we learn a database query that is a representation of this
product concept. Second, we learn product concepts and their corresponding

challenge. Here, we show that noncollinear antiferromagnets (NCAFM) with kagome
structure host gapless self-oscillations whose frequencies are tunable from 0
Hz to the THz regime via electrically induced spin-orbit torques (SOTs). The
auto-oscillations' initiation, bandwidth, and amplitude are investigated by
deriving an effective theory, which captures the reactive and dissipative SOTs.
We find that the dynamics strongly depends on the ground state's chirality,
with one chirality having gapped excitations, whereas the opposite chirality
provides gapless self-oscillations. Our results reveal that NCAFMs offer unique
THz functional components, which could play a significant role in filling the
THz technology gap.

modular trajectories. MPs can be broadly categorized into two types: (a)
dynamics-based approaches that generate smooth trajectories from any initial
state, e. g., Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs), and (b) probabilistic
approaches that capture higher-order statistics of the motion, e. g.,
Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMPs). To date, however, there is no
method that unifies both, i. e. that can generate smooth trajectories from an
arbitrary initial state while capturing higher-order statistics. In this paper,
we introduce a unified perspective of both approaches by solving the ODE
underlying the DMPs. We convert expensive online numerical integration of DMPs
into basis functions that can be computed offline. These basis functions can be
used to represent trajectories or trajectory distributions similar to ProMPs
while maintaining all the properties of dynamical systems. Since we inherit the

Dynamic Movement Primitives (ProDMPs). Additionally, we embed ProDMPs in deep
neural network architecture and propose a new cost function for efficient
end-to-end learning of higher-order trajectory statistics. To this end, we
leverage Bayesian Aggregation for non-linear iterative conditioning on sensory

diversity. Accounting for diversity helps to avoid redundancy, and thus, to
control the number of rules in the solution set. To tackle the said

quantification and propagation in scientific applications. A key challenge in
applying MCMC to scientific domains is computation: the target density of
interest is often a function of expensive computations, such as a high-fidelity
physical simulation, an intractable integral, or a slowly-converging iterative
algorithm. Thus, using an MCMC algorithms with an expensive target density
becomes impractical, as these expensive computations need to be evaluated at
each iteration of the algorithm. In practice, these computations often
approximated via a cheaper, low-fidelity computation, leading to bias in the
resulting target density. Multi-fidelity MCMC algorithms combine models of
varying fidelities in order to obtain an approximate target density with lower
computational cost. In this paper, we describe a class of asymptotically exact
multi-fidelity MCMC algorithms for the setting where a sequence of models of
increasing fidelity can be computed that approximates the expensive target
density of interest. We take a pseudo-marginal MCMC approach for multi-fidelity
inference that utilizes a cheaper, randomized-fidelity unbiased estimator of

of the low-fidelity sequence of models. Finally, we discuss and evaluate the

log-Gaussian Cox process modeling, Bayesian ODE system identification,

information, which is difficult to obtain through vehicle sensors themselves,
is collected and utilized through communication with surrounding infrastructure
in connected vehicle networks. For this reason, we consider a scenario that
utilizes infrastructure such as road side units (RSUs) and macro base station
(MBS) in situations where caching of road environment information is required.
Due to the rapidly changed road environment, a concept which represents a
freshness of the road content, age of information (AoI), is important. Based on
the AoI value, in the connected vehicle system, it is essential to keep
appropriate content in the RSUs in advance, update it before the content is
expired, and send the content to the vehicles which want to use it. However,
too frequent content transmission for the minimum AoI leads to indiscriminate
use of network resources. Furthermore, a transmission control, that content AoI
and service delay are not properly considered adversely, affects user service.
Therefore, it is important to find an appropriate compromise. For these
reasons, the objective of this paper is about to reduce the system cost used
for content delivery through the proposed system while minimizing the content
AoI presented in MBS, RSUs and UVs. The transmission process, which is able to
be divided into two states, i.e., content caching and service, is approached
using Markov decision process (MDP) and Lyapunov optimization framework,
respectively, which guarantee optimal solutions, as verified via data-intensive
performance evaluation.

increase the share of clean energy, power systems are increasingly becoming
susceptible to frequency instability after outages due to reduced levels of
inertia. To address this issue frequency constraints are being included in the
scheduling process, which ensure a tolerable frequency deviation in case of any
contingencies. In this paper, a method is proposed to integrate the non-linear
frequency nadir constraint into the unit commitment problem, using machine
learning. First a synthetic training dataset is generated. Then two of the
available classic machine learning methods, namely logistic regression and
support vector machine, are proposed to predict the frequency nadir. To be able
to compare the machine learning methods to traditional frequency constrained
unit commitment approaches, simulations on the power system of La Palma island
are carried out for both proposed methods as well as an analytical linearized
formulation of the frequency nadir. Our results show that the unit commitment
problem with a machine learning based frequency nadir constraint is solved
considerably faster than with the analytical formulation, while still achieving
an acceptable frequency response quality after outages.

sensitivity has presented a unique opportunity to perform the first HXR imaging
spectroscopy on a range of features in the quiet Sun. By studying the HXR
emission of these features we can detect or constrain the presence of high
temperature (>5 MK) or non-thermal sources, to help understand how they relate
to larger more energetic solar phenomena, and determine their contribution to
heating the solar atmosphere. We report on several features observed in the 28
September 2018 NuSTAR full-disk quiet Sun mosaics, the first of the NuSTAR
quiet Sun observing campaigns, which mostly include steady features of X-ray
bright points and an emerging flux region which later evolved into an active
region, as well as a short-lived jet. We find that the features' HXR spectra
are well fitted with isothermal models with temperatures ranging between
2.0-3.2 MK. Combining the NuSTAR data with softer X-ray emission from
Hinode/XRT and EUV from SDO/AIA we recover the differential emission measures,
confirming little significant emission above 4 MK. The NuSTAR HXR spectra allow
us to constrain the possible non-thermal emission that would still be
consistent with a null HXR detection. We found that for only one of the
features (the jet) was there a potential non-thermal upper limit capable of
powering the heating observed. However, even here the non-thermal electron
distribution had to be very steep (effectively mono-energetic) with a low
energy cut-off between 3-4 keV. The higher temperature or non-thermal sources
in the typical quiet Sun features found in this September 2018 data are
therefore found to be very weak, if present at all.

from several eV to ~100 eV. If a stable or long lived defect is created as a

the deformed lattice and is therefore not observable in a phonon detector.
Thus, an accurate model of this effect is necessary for precise calibration of
the recoil energy measurement in low threshold phonon detectors. Furthermore,
the sharpness of the defect creation threshold varies between materials. For a
hard material such as diamond, the sharp threshold will cause a sudden onset of
the energy loss effect, resulting in a prominent peak in the observed recoil

discretization is based on finite elements in space and time and allows for
arbitrary polynomial orders. It was first analyzed in [O. Karakashian, C.

In this work we revisit the approach in the generalized setting of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation with rotation and we prove uniform $L^\infty$-bounds
for the corresponding numerical approximations in 2D and 3D without coupling

such as faster end-effector velocities and less energy consumption. However,
their flexible structure can lead to undesired oscillations. Therefore, the
applied control strategy should account for these elasticities. A feedforward
controller based on an inverse model of the system is an efficient way to
improve the performance. However, unstable internal dynamics arise for many
common flexible robots and stable inversion must be applied. In this
contribution, an approximation of the original stable inversion approach is
proposed. The approximation simplifies the problem setup, since the internal
dynamics do not need to be derived explicitly for the definition of the
boundary conditions. From a practical point of view, this makes the method
applicable to more complex systems with many unactuated degrees of freedom.
Flexible manipulators modeled by the absolute nodal coordinate formulation

low-mass NSCs in dwarf galaxies ($M_\text{gal} < 10^{9} M_\odot$) form
predominantly out of the merger of globular clusters (GCs), high-mass NSCs in
massive galaxies have assembled most of their mass through central enriched
star formation. So far, these results of a transition in the dominant NSC
formation channel have been based on studies of early-type galaxies and massive
late-type galaxies. Here, we present the first spectroscopic analysis of a
sample of nine nucleated late-type dwarf galaxies with the aim of identifying
the dominant NSC formation pathway. We use integral-field spectroscopy data
obtained with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument to
analyse the ages, metallicities, star formation histories, and star formation
rates of the NSCs and their surroundings. Our sample includes galaxies with
stellar masses $M_\text{gal} = 10^7 - 10^9 M_\odot$ and NSC masses
$M_\text{NSC} = 6 \times 10^4 - 6 \times 10^{6} M_\odot$. Although all NSC
spectra show emission lines, this emission is not always connected to star
formation within the NSC, but rather to other regions along the line-of-sight.
The NSC star formation histories reveal that metal-poor and old populations
dominate the stellar populations in five NSCs, possibly stemming from the
inspiral of GCs. The NSCs of the most massive galaxies in our sample show
significant contributions from young and enriched populations that indicate
additional mass growth through central star formation. Our results support
previous findings of a transition in the dominant NSC formation channel with
galaxy mass, showing that the NSCs in low-mass galaxies predominantly grow
through the inspiral of GCs, while central star formation can contribute to NSC
growth in more massive galaxies.

  To this end, we propose Flow2Flow, a unified framework that could jointly
achieve training sample expansion and cross-modality image generation for V2I
person ReID.
  Specifically, Flow2Flow learns bijective transformations from both the
visible image domain and the infrared domain to a shared isotropic Gaussian
domain with an invertible visible flow-based generator and an infrared one,
respectively.
  With Flow2Flow, we are able to generate pseudo training samples by the
transformation from latent Gaussian noises to visible or infrared images, and
generate cross-modality images by transformations from existing-modality images
to latent Gaussian noises to missing-modality images.
  For the purpose of identity alignment and modality alignment of generated
images, we develop adversarial training strategies to train Flow2Flow.
  Specifically, we design an image encoder and a modality discriminator for
each modality.
  The image encoder encourages the generated images to be similar to real
images of the same identity via identity adversarial training, and the modality
discriminator makes the generated images modal-indistinguishable from real
images via modality adversarial training.
  Experimental results on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB demonstrate that both training
sample expansion and cross-modality image generation can significantly improve
V2I ReID accuracy.

above absolute zero, which exchanges energy with its environment in the form of
radiation. Blackbody thermal emission is largely incoherent both spatially and
temporally. Using principles in nanophotonics, thermal emission with
characteristics that differ considerably from those of a blackbody have been
demonstrated. In particular, by leveraging intrinsic properties of emerging
materials or via nanostructuring at the wavelength or sub-wavelength scale, one
can gain control over the directionality, temporal coherence, and other more
exotic properties of thermal radiation. Typically, however, these are fixed at
the time of fabrication. Gaining dynamic control of thermal emission requires
exploiting external mechanisms that actively modulate radiative properties.
Numerous applications can benefit from such thermal emission control, for
example in solar energy harvesting, thermo-photovoltaic energy conversion,
radiative cooling, sensing, spectroscopy, imaging and thermal camouflage. In
this tutorial, we introduce thermal emission in two domains: the far-field, and
the near-field, and we outline experimental approaches for probing thermal
radiation in both ranges. We discuss ways for tailoring the spatial and

information required for better planning and management of post-disaster relief

identify the extent of damage caused by flooding. The data acquired from
sensors onboard earth observation satellites are analyzed to detect the flooded
regions, which can be affected by low spatial and temporal resolution. However,
in recent years, the images acquired from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have
also been utilized to assess post-disaster damage. Indeed, a UAV based platform
can be rapidly deployed with a customized flight plan and minimum dependence on
the ground infrastructure. This work proposes two approaches for identifying
flooded regions in UAV aerial images. The first approach utilizes texture-based
unsupervised segmentation to detect flooded areas, while the second uses an
artificial neural network on the texture features to classify images as flooded
and non-flooded. Unlike the existing works where the models are trained and
tested on images of the same geographical regions, this work studies the
performance of the proposed model in identifying flooded regions across
geographical regions. An F1-score of 0.89 is obtained using the proposed
segmentation-based approach which is higher than existing classifiers. The
robustness of the proposed approach demonstrates that it can be utilized to
identify flooded regions of any region with minimum or no user intervention.

these latent factors can have persistent effects on observables. Here, we use
experimental data from dynamical systems drawn from cardiac physiology and

Akin to the neuroscience studies suggesting separate brain systems for

separate modules of neural perception, syntactic parsing, and semantic

prove that NSR is expressive enough to model various sequence-to-sequence

of equivariance and recursiveness embedded in NSR. In experiments, NSR achieves
state-of-the-art performance in three benchmarks from different domains: SCAN

reasoning. Specifically, NSR achieves 100% generalization accuracy on SCAN and
PCFG and outperforms state-of-the-art models on HINT by about 23%. Our NSR
demonstrates stronger generalization than pure neural networks due to its

while remaining plausible is essential for conducting in-silico trials of
medical devices. However, not all anatomical shapes of interest are always
available for each individual in a population. Hence,
missing/partially-overlapping anatomical information is often available across
individuals in a population. We introduce a generative shape model for complex
anatomical structures, learnable from datasets of unpaired datasets. The
proposed generative model can synthesise complete whole complex shape
assemblies coined virtual chimaeras, as opposed to natural human chimaeras. We
applied this framework to build virtual chimaeras from databases of whole-heart
shape assemblies that each contribute samples for heart substructures.
Specifically, we propose a generative shape compositional framework which
comprises two components - a part-aware generative shape model which captures
the variability in shape observed for each structure of interest in the
training population; and a spatial composition network which assembles/composes
the structures synthesised by the former into multi-part shape assemblies (viz.
virtual chimaeras). We also propose a novel self supervised learning scheme
that enables the spatial composition network to be trained with partially
overlapping data and weak labels. We trained and validated our approach using
shapes of cardiac structures derived from cardiac magnetic resonance images
available in the UK Biobank. Our approach significantly outperforms a PCA-based
shape model (trained with complete data) in terms of generalisability and
specificity. This demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach as the
synthesised cardiac virtual populations are more plausible and capture a
greater degree of variability in shape than those generated by the PCA-based
shape model.

and accelerates charged particles to high energies. Simulations of the
atmosphere in three dimensions that include the effects of accelerated
particles can aid our understanding of the interplay between energetic particle
beams and the environment where they emerge and propagate. We presented the
first attempt at such a simulation in a previous paper, emphasising the
physical model of particle beams. However, the numerical implementation of this
model is not straightforward due to the diverse conditions in the atmosphere
and the way we must distribute computation between multiple CPU cores. Aims.
Here, we describe and verify our numerical implementation of energy transport
by electron beams in a 3D magnetohydrodynamics code parallelised by domain
decomposition. Methods. We trace beam trajectories using a Runge-Kutta scheme
with adaptive step length control and integrate deposited beam energy along the
trajectories with a hybrid analytical and numerical approach. To parallelise
this, we coordinate beam transport across subdomains owned by separate
processes using a buffering system designed to optimise data flow. Results.
Using an ad hoc magnetic field with analytical field lines as a test scenario,
we show that our parallel implementation of adaptive tracing efficiently
follows a challenging trajectory with high precision. By timing executions of
electron beam transport with different numbers of processes, we found that the
processes communicate with minimal overhead but that the parallel scalability
is still sublinear due to workload imbalance caused by the uneven spatial
distribution of beams.

impressive results in self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE).
Whereas, such a representation would cause the discontinuity of the ground as
it is perpendicular to the frontal-parallel planes, which is detrimental to the
identification of drivable space in autonomous driving. In this paper, we
propose the PlaneDepth, a novel orthogonal planes based presentation, including
vertical planes and ground planes. PlaneDepth estimates the depth distribution
using a Laplacian Mixture Model based on orthogonal planes for an input image.
These planes are used to synthesize a reference view to provide the
self-supervision signal. Further, we find that the widely used resizing and
cropping data augmentation breaks the orthogonality assumptions, leading to
inferior plane predictions. We address this problem by explicitly constructing
the resizing cropping transformation to rectify the predefined planes and
predicted camera pose. Moreover, we propose an augmented self-distillation loss
supervised with a bilateral occlusion mask to boost the robustness of
orthogonal planes representation for occlusions. Thanks to our orthogonal
planes representation, we can extract the ground plane in an unsupervised
manner, which is important for autonomous driving. Extensive experiments on the

array of species for over many decades. Traditional anti-poaching initiatives
target catching the poachers. However, the challenge is far more complicated
than catching individual poachers. Poaching is an industry which needs to be
fully investigated. Many stakeholders are directly and indirectly involved in
poaching activities (e.g., some local restaurants illegally providing meat to
tourists). Therefore, stopping or severely decapitating the poaching industry
requires a unified understanding of all stakeholders. The best way to uncover
these geographical and social relationships is to track the movements of
poachers. However, location tracking is challenging in most rural areas where
wildlife sanctuaries are typically located. Internet-connected communication
(e.g. 3G) technologies typically used in urban cities are not feasible in these
rural areas. Therefore, we decided to develop an SMS (short message service)
base low-cost tracking system (SMS-TRACCAR) to track poachers. The proposed
system was developed to be deployed in Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, Sabah,
Malaysia and nearby villages and cities where poachers typically move around.
Our evaluations demonstrated that SMS-based tracking could provide sufficient
quality (granular) data (with minimum energy consumption) that enable us to
monitor poacher vehicle movements within rural areas where no other modern
communication technologies are feasible to use. However, it is important to
note that our system can be used in any domain that requires SMS-based
geo-location tracking. SMS-TRACCAR can be configured to track individuals as
well as groups. Therefore, SMS-TRACCAR contributes not only to the wildlife
domain but in the wider context as well.

lower-dimensional embedding space such that similar images are closer together
than dissimilar images. When used for item retrieval, a query image is embedded
using the trained model and the closest items from a database storing their
respective embeddings are returned as the most similar items for the query.
Especially in product retrieval, where a user searches for a certain product by
taking a photo of it, the image background is usually not important and thus
should not influence the embedding process. Ideally, the retrieval process
always returns fitting items for the photographed object, regardless of the
environment the photo was taken in. In this paper, we analyze the influence of
the image background on Deep Metric Learning models by utilizing five common
loss functions and three common datasets. We find that Deep Metric Learning
networks are prone to so-called background bias, which can lead to a severe
decrease in retrieval performance when changing the image background during
inference. We also show that replacing the background of images during training
with random background images alleviates this issue. Since we use an automatic
background removal method to do this background replacement, no additional
manual labeling work and model changes are required while inference time stays
the same. Qualitative and quantitative analyses, for which we introduce a new
evaluation metric, confirm that models trained with replaced backgrounds attend
more to the main object in the image, benefitting item retrieval systems.

iii) ellipsoidal model (EM); iv) MIRD approach with organ S-factors from

analysis in supersonic three-temperature carbon dioxide (CO2) turbulent channel
flow. CO2 is a linear and symmetric triatomic molecular, with the thermal
non-equilibrium three-temperature effects arising from the interactions among
translational, rotational and vibrational modes under room temperature. Thus,
the rotational and vibrational modes of CO2 are addressed. Thermal
non-equilibrium effect of CO2 has been modeled in an extended three-temperature
BGK-type model, with the calibrated translational, rotational and vibrational
relaxation time. To solve the extended BGK-type equation accurately and
robustly, non-equilibrium high-accuracy gas-kinetic scheme is proposed within
the well-established two-stage fourth-order framework. Compared with the
one-temperature supersonic turbulent channel flow, supersonic three-temperature
CO2 turbulence enlarges the ensemble heat transfer of the wall by approximate
20%, and slightly decreases the ensemble frictional force. The ensemble density
and temperature fields are greatly affected, and there is little change in Van
Driest transformation of streamwise velocity. The thermal non-equilibrium
three-temperature effects of CO2 also suppress the peak of normalized
root-mean-square of density and temperature, normalized turbulent intensities
and Reynolds stress. The vibrational modes of CO2 behave quite differently with
rotational and translational modes. Compared with the vibrational temperature
fields, the rotational temperature fields have the higher similarity with
translational temperature fields, especially in temperature amplitude. Current
thermal non-equilibrium models, high-accuracy DNS and physical analysis in
supersonic CO2 turbulent flow can act as the benchmark for the long-term
applicability of compressible CO2 turbulence.

Unfortunately, calculating the energy consumption of a given neural network

to collect the energy consumption of convolutional and fully connected layers
on two well-known edge boards by NVIDIA, namely Jetson TX2 and Xavier. From the
measurements, we have then distilled a simple, practical model that can provide
an estimate of the energy consumption of a certain inference task on the

for instance, to guide the search for efficient architectures in Neural

  Firstly, we show that non-blind polychromatic ptychography can be seen as a
recovery from quadratic measurements. Then, a reconstruction from such
measurements can be performed by a variant of Amplitude Flow algorithm, which
has guaranteed sublinear convergence to a critical point. Secondly, we address

image pre-training. In contrast to previous dominating self-supervised methods,
i.e., contrastive learning, MIM attains state-of-the-art performance by masking
and reconstructing random patches of the input image. However, the associated
security and privacy risks of this novel generative method are unexplored. In
this paper, we perform the first security risk quantification of MIM through
the lens of backdoor attacks. Different from previous work, we are the first to
systematically threat modeling on SSL in every phase of the model supply chain,
i.e., pre-training, release, and downstream phases. Our evaluation shows that
models built with MIM are vulnerable to existing backdoor attacks in release
and downstream phases and are compromised by our proposed method in
pre-training phase. For instance, on CIFAR10, the attack success rate can reach
99.62%, 96.48%, and 98.89% in the downstream phase, release phase, and
pre-training phase, respectively. We also take the first step to investigate
the success factors of backdoor attacks in the pre-training phase and find the
trigger number and trigger pattern play key roles in the success of backdoor
attacks while trigger location has only tiny effects. In the end, our empirical
study of the defense mechanisms across three detection-level on model supply
chain phases indicates that different defenses are suitable for backdoor
attacks in different phases. However, backdoor attacks in the release phase
cannot be detected by all three detection-level methods, calling for more
effective defenses in future research.

the resulting kernel matrix in $O(n)$ space in $O(n \log n)$ time, as a sum of
sparse rank-one matrices, and approximately invert the kernel matrix in $O(n)$
time. Sparse GP methods also offer linear run time, but they predict less well
than higher dimensional kernels. On a classic suite of regression tasks, we
compare our kernel against Mat\'ern, sparse, and sparse variational kernels.
The binary tree GP assigns the highest likelihood to the test data on a

numbers. A ratrec sequence is defined via a system of sequences using mutually
recursive equations of depth 1, where the next values are computed as rational
functions of the previous values. An alternative class is that of simple ratrec
sequences, where one uses a single recursive equation, however of depth k: the
next value is defined as a rational function of k previous values.
  We conjecture that the classes ratrec and simple ratrec coincide. The main
contribution of this paper is a proof of a variant of this conjecture where the
initial conditions are treated symbolically, using a formal variable per
sequence, while the sequences themselves consist of rational functions over
those variables. While the initial conjecture does not follow from this
variant, we hope that the introduced algebraic techniques may eventually be
helpful in resolving the problem.
  The class ratrec strictly generalises a well-known class of polynomial
recursive sequences (polyrec). These are defined like ratrec, but using
polynomial functions instead of rational ones. One can observe that if our
conjecture is true and effective, then we can improve the complexities of the
zeroness and the equivalence problems for polyrec sequences. Currently, the
only known upper bound is Ackermanian, which follows from results on polynomial
automata. We complement this observation by proving a PSPACE lower bound for
both problems for polyrec. Our lower bound construction also implies that the
Skolem problem is PSPACE-hard for the polyrec class.

compressibility. The proposed scheme is implemented in the finite-volume
Seven-League Hydro (SLH) code, and it makes use of a low-Mach version of the
five-wave Harten-Lax-van Leer discontinuities (HLLD) solver to reduce numerical
dissipation, an implicit-explicit time discretization technique based on Strang
splitting to overcome the overly strict CFL constraint, and a well-balancing
method that dramatically reduces the magnitude of spatial discretization errors
in strongly stratified setups. The solenoidal constraint on the magnetic field
is enforced by using a constrained transport method on a staggered grid. We
carry out five verification tests, including the simulation of a small-scale
dynamo in a star-like environment at M_son ~ 0.001 . We demonstrate that the
proposed scheme can be used to accurately simulate compressible MHD flows in
regimes of low Mach numbers and strongly stratified setups even with moderately
coarse grids.

robot social navigation driven by the robot's ""opinion"" for which way and by
how much to pass human movers crossing its path. The robot forms an opinion
over time according to nonlinear dynamics that depend on the robot's
observations of human movers and its level of attention to these social cues.
For these dynamics, it is guaranteed that when the robot's attention is greater
than a critical value, deadlock in decision making is broken, and the robot
rapidly forms a strong opinion, passing each human mover even if the robot has
no bias nor evidence for which way to pass. We enable proactive rapid and
reliable social navigation by having the robot grow its attention across the
critical value when a human mover approaches. With human-robot experiments we
demonstrate the flexibility of our approach and validate our analytical results
on deadlock-breaking. We also show that a single design parameter can tune the
trade-off between efficiency and reliability in human-robot passing. The new
approach has the additional advantage that it does not rely on a predictive
model of human behavior.

congestion influences on travel time prediction, we additionally propose to use
a bidirectional layer at the decoder (something unexplored in other time-series

negative Poisson's ratio. These structures open up various potential
opportunities in impact resistance, high energy absorption, and flexible
robotics, among others. Interestingly, auxetic structures could also be
tailored to provide passive adaptation to changes in environmental stimuli --
an adaptation of this concept is explored in this paper in the context of
designing a novel load-adaptive gripper system.
  Defining the design in terms of repeating parametric unit cells from which
the finite structure can be synthesized presents an attractive
computationally-efficient approach to designing auxetic structures. This
approach also decouples the optimization cost and the size of the overall
structure, and avoids the pitfalls of system-scale design e.g., via topology
optimization. In this paper, a surrogate-based design optimization framework is
presented to implement the concept of passively load-adaptive structures (of
given outer shape) synthesized from auxetic unit cells. Open-source meshing,
FEA and Bayesian Optimization tools are integrated to develop this
computational framework, enhancing it adopt-ability and extensibility.
Demonstration of the concept and the underlying framework is performed by
designing a simplified robotic gripper, with the objective to maximize the
ratio of towards-load (gripping) horizontal displacement to the load-affected
vertical displacement. Optimal auxetic cell-based design generated thereof is
found to be four times better in terms of exhibited contact reaction force when
compared to a design obtained with topology optimization that is subjected to
the same specified maximum loading.

specification. However, requiring a strategy to meet the specification in every
situation is, in many cases, too hard of a requirement. Particularly in
compositional synthesis of distributed systems, individual winning strategies
for the processes often do not exist. Remorsefree dominance, a weaker notion
than winning, accounts for such situations: dominant strategies are only
required to be as good as any alternative strategy, i.e., they are allowed to
violate the specification if no other strategy would have satisfied it in the
same situation. The composition of dominant strategies is only guaranteed to be
dominant for safety properties, though; preventing the use of dominance in
compositional synthesis for liveness specifications. Yet, safety properties are
often not expressive enough. In this paper, we thus introduce a new winning
condition for strategies, called delay-dominance, that overcomes this weakness
of remorsefree~dominance: we show that it is compositional for many safety and
liveness specifications, enabling a compositional synthesis algorithm based on
delay-dominance for general specifications. Furthermore, we introduce an
automaton construction for recognizing delay-dominant strategies and prove its
soundness and completeness. The resulting automaton is of single-exponential
size in the squared length of the specification and can immediately be used for
safraless synthesis procedures. Thus, synthesis of delay-dominant strategies
is, as synthesis of winning strategies, in 2EXPTIME.

parallel testing, and tester turnover within long evolving history, there are
inevitably lots of redundant test cases, which significantly increase the cost.
Previous redundancy detection approaches typically treat the textual
descriptions as a whole to compare their similarity and suffer from low
precision. Our observation reveals that a test case can have explicit
test-oriented entities, such as tested function Components, Constraints, etc;
and there are also specific relations between these entities. This inspires us
with a potential opportunity for accurate redundancy detection. In this paper,
we first define five test-oriented entity categories and four associated
relation categories and re-formulate the NL test case redundancy detection
problem as the comparison of detailed testing content guided by the
test-oriented entities and relations. Following that, we propose Tscope, a
fine-grained approach for redundant NL test case detection by dissecting test
cases into atomic test tuple(s) with the entities restricted by associated
relations. To serve as the test case dissection, Tscope designs a context-aware
model for the automatic entity and relation extraction. Evaluation on 3,467
test cases from ten projects shows Tscope could achieve 91.8% precision, 74.8%
recall, and 82.4% F1, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches

redundant detection problem can motivate the follow-up studies to further

planning, and optimum control problems. Several attempts have been made at
model-based multi-robot localization, and few have formulated the multi-robot
collaborative localization problem as a factor graph problem to solve through
graph optimization. Here, the optimization objective is to minimize the errors
of estimating the relative location estimates in a distributed manner. Our
novel graph-theoretic approach to solving this problem consists of three major
components; (connectivity) graph formation, expansion through transition model,
and optimization of relative poses. First, we estimate the relative
pose-connectivity graph using the received signal strength between the
connected robots, indicating relative ranges between them. Then, we apply a
motion model to formulate graph expansion and optimize them using g$^2$o graph
optimization as a distributed solver over dynamic networks. Finally, we
theoretically analyze the algorithm and numerically validate its optimality and
performance through extensive simulations. The results demonstrate the
practicality of the proposed solution compared to a state-of-the-art algorithm
for collaborative localization in multi-robot systems.

$\Bbbk$-linear (dg) monoidal categories, $F,G\colon C\to D$ are $\Bbbk$-linear
(dg) strict monoidal functors, $\eta,\theta\colon F\Rightarrow G$ are monoidal
natural transformations. Morally, it is a complex of ``derived modifications''
$\eta \Rrightarrow \theta$, likewise for the case of dg categories one has the
complex of ``derived natural transformations'' $F\Rightarrow G$, given by the
Hochschild cochain complex of $C$ with coefficients in $C$-bimodule $D(F-,G=)$.
As well, an intrinsic homological algebra interpretation of
$C^\bullet(C,D)(F,G)(\eta,\theta)$ as $RHom$ in an abelian category of
2-bimodules over $C$, is provided.
  The complex $C^\bullet(C,D)(F,G)(\eta,\theta)$ naturally arises from a
2-cocellular dg vector space $A(C,D)(F,G)(\eta,\theta)\colon \Theta_2\to
C^\bullet(\Bbbk)$, as its $\Theta_2$-totalization (here $\Theta_2$ is the
category dual to the category of Joyal 2-disks).
  It is shown that
$H^3(C^\bullet(C,C)(\mathrm{Id},\mathrm{Id})(\mathrm{id},\mathrm{id})))$ is
isomorphic to the vector space of the outer infinitesimal deformations of the
$\Bbbk$-linear monoidal category which we call {\it full} deformations. It
means that the following data is to be deformed: (a) the underlying dg category
structure, (b) the monoidal product on morphisms (the monoidal product on
objects is a set-theoretical datum and is maintained under the deformation),
(c) the associator. It is shown that
$C^\bullet(C,D)(F,F)(\mathrm{id},\mathrm{id})$ is a homotopy $e_2$-algebra.
Conjecturally,
$C^\bullet(C,C)(\mathrm{Id},\mathrm{Id})(\mathrm{id},\mathrm{id})$ is a
homotopy $e_3$-algebra; however the proof requires more sophisticated methods
and we hope to complete it in our next paper.

fixed final time. The tool is designed to produce optimal trajectories for a
variety of initial conditions and leader trajectories. Triple integrator
dynamics are used to model the follower aircraft in three dimensions. Control
is applied directly to the rate of acceleration. Both the follower's and
leader's velocities and accelerations are bounded, as dictated by the
aircraft's performance envelope. Lastly, a path constraint is used to ensure
the follower avoids the leader's jet wash region. This optimal control problem
is solved through numerical analysis using the direct orthogonal collocation
solver GPOPS-II. Two leader trajectories are investigated, including a
descending spiral and continuous vertical loops. Additionally, a study of the
effect of various initial guesses is performed. All trajectories displayed a
direct capture of the formation position, however changes in solver initial
conditions demonstrate various behaviors in how the follower maintains the
formation position. The developed tool has proven adequate to support future
research in crafting real-time controllers capable of determining near-optimal

astronomical image will therefore have a unique PSF that is non-circular and

approximation in a unifying framework for fast and flexible inference under the
Bayesian paradigm. Gaussian Markov field priors imposed on penalized latent
variables and the Bernstein-von Mises theorem typically ensure a razor-sharp
accuracy of the Laplace approximation to the posterior distribution of these
variables. This accuracy can be seriously compromised for some unpenalized
parameters, especially when the information synthesized by the prior and the
likelihood is sparse. We propose a refined version of the LPS methodology by
splitting the latent space in two subsets. The first set involves latent
variables for which the joint posterior distribution is approached from a
non-Gaussian perspective with an approximation scheme that is particularly well
tailored to capture asymmetric patterns, while the posterior distribution for
parameters in the complementary latent set undergoes a traditional treatment
with Laplace approximations. As such, the dichotomization of the latent space
provides the necessary structure for a separate treatment of model parameters,
yielding improved estimation accuracy as compared to a setting where posterior
quantities are uniformly handled with Laplace. In addition, the proposed
enriched version of LPS remains entirely sampling-free, so that it operates at
a computing speed that is far from reach to any existing Markov chain Monte
Carlo approach. The methodology is illustrated on the additive proportional
odds model with an application on ordinal survey data.

investigations of N2O as a biosignature have examined scenarios using Earthlike
N2O mixing ratios or surface fluxes, or those inferred from Earth's geologic
record. However, biological fluxes of N2O could be substantially higher, due to
a lack of metal catalysts or if the last step of the denitrification metabolism
that yields N2 from N2O had never evolved. Here, we use a global biogeochemical
model coupled with photochemical and spectral models to systematically quantify
the limits of plausible N2O abundances and spectral detectability for Earth
analogs orbiting main-sequence (FGKM) stars. We examine N2O buildup over a
range of oxygen conditions (1%-100% present atmospheric level) and N2O fluxes
(0.01-100 teramole per year; Tmol = 10^12 mole) that are compatible with
Earth's history. We find that N2O fluxes of 10 [100] Tmol yr$^{-1}$ would lead
to maximum N2O abundances of ~5 [50] ppm for Earth-Sun analogs, 90 [1600] ppm
for Earths around late K dwarfs, and 30 [300] ppm for an Earthlike TRAPPIST-1e.
We simulate emission and transmission spectra for intermediate and maximum N2O
concentrations that are relevant to current and future space-based telescopes.
We calculate the detectability of N2O spectral features for high-flux scenarios

chemodenitrification and abiotic production via stellar activity, and identify
key spectral and contextual discriminants to confirm or refute the biogenicity

describes the dynamics of an open quantum system that is in contact with a heat

the system we hope to thermalize. Using the state-of-the-art techniques for
quantum simulation of the Lindblad equation, we devise a technique for the

  In doing so, we encounter a severe technical challenge: implementation of the
Davies generator demands the ability to estimate the energy of the system
unambiguously. That is, each energy of the system must be deterministically
mapped to a unique estimate. Previous work showed that this is only possible if
the system satisfies an unphysical 'rounding promise' assumption. We solve this
problem by engineering a random ensemble of rounding promises that
simultaneously solves three problems: First, each rounding promise admits
preparation of a 'promised' thermal state via a Davies generator. Second, these
Davies generators have a similar mixing time as the ideal Davies generator.
Third, the average of these promised thermal states approximates the ideal
thermal state.

existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) models are trained on data from
all domains jointly in one step. Such an one-step approach limits their ability
to adapt to the target domain. This is because the training set is dominated by
the more numerous and labeled source domain data. The source-domain-bias can
potentially be alleviated by introducing a second training step, where the
model is fine-tuned with the unlabeled target domain data only using pseudo
labels as supervision. However, the pseudo labels are inevitably noisy and when
used unchecked can negatively impact the model performance. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Bi-level Optimization based Robust Target Training
(BORT$^2$) method for MSDA. Given any existing fully-trained one-step MSDA
model, BORT$^2$ turns it to a labeling function to generate pseudo-labels for
the target data and trains a target model using pseudo-labeled target data
only. Crucially, the target model is a stochastic CNN which is designed to be
intrinsically robust against label noise generated by the labeling function.
Such a stochastic CNN models each target instance feature as a Gaussian
distribution with an entropy maximization regularizer deployed to measure the
label uncertainty, which is further exploited to alleviate the negative impact
of noisy pseudo labels. Training the labeling function and the target model
poses a nested bi-level optimization problem, for which we formulate an elegant
solution based on implicit differentiation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves the state of the art performance on three

occurrence of a springboard effect, where the addition of a patch contributes

intriguing phenomena in physics. In recent years, the ultrafast dynamical
control and creation of novel ordered states of matter not accessible in
thermodynamic equilibrium is receiving much attention. Among those, the
theoretical concept of dynamical multiferroicity has been introduced to
describe the emergence of magnetization by means of a time-dependent electric
polarization in non-ferromagnetic materials. In simple terms, a large amplitude
coherent rotating motion of the ions in a crystal induces a magnetic moment
along the axis of rotation. However, the experimental verification of this
effect is still lacking. Here, we provide evidence of room temperature
magnetization in the archetypal paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ due to this
mechanism. To achieve it, we resonantly drive the infrared-active soft phonon
mode with intense circularly polarized terahertz electric field, and detect a
large magneto-optical Kerr effect. A simple model, which includes two coupled
nonlinear oscillators whose forces and couplings are derived with ab-initio
calculations using self-consistent phonon theory at a finite temperature,
reproduces qualitatively our experimental observations on the temporal and
frequency domains. A quantitatively correct magnitude of the effect is obtained
when one also considers the phonon analogue of the reciprocal of the Einsten -
de Haas effect, also called the Barnett effect, where the total angular
momentum from the phonon order is transferred to the electronic one. Our
findings show a new path for designing ultrafast magnetic switches by means of
coherent control of lattice vibrations with light.

problem due to ambiguities that stem from projective geometry and heavy

explicitly modeling the distribution of plausible reconstructions in a

the posterior distribution through a novel determinant magnitude
regularization, which is key to varied 3D hand pose samples that project well
into the input image. We also demonstrate that metrics commonly used to assess
reconstruction quality are insufficient to evaluate pose predictions under such
severe ambiguity. To address this, we release the first dataset with multiple
plausible annotations per image called MultiHands. The additional annotations
enable us to evaluate the estimated distribution using the maximum mean

requires ultrafast laser setups. Photoemission from an engineered electron
source is used to generate pulsed electrons, interacting with a sample that is
excited by the ultrafast laser pulse at a specified time delay. Thus,
developing an ultrafast electron microscope demands the exploitation of
extrinsic laser excitations and complex synchronization schemes. Here, we
present an inverse approach based on cathodoluminescence spectroscopy to
introduce internal radiation sources in an electron microscope. Our method is
based on a sequential interaction of the electron beam with an electron-driven
photon source (EDPHS) and the investigated sample. An electron-driven photon
source in an electron microscope generates phase-locked photons that are
mutually coherent with the near-field distribution of the swift electron. Due
to their different velocities, one can readily change the delay between the
photons and electrons arriving at the sample by changing the distance between
the EDPHS and the sample. We demonstrate the mutual coherence between the
radiations from the EDPHS and the sample by performing interferometry with a
combined system of an EDPHS and a WSe2 flake. We assert the mutual frequency
and momentum-dependent correlation of the EDPHS and sample radiation, and
determine experimentally the degree of mutual coherence of up to 27%. This
level of mutual coherence allows us to perform spectral interferometry with an
electron microscope. Our method has the advantage of being simple, compact and
operating with continuous electron beams. It will open the door to local
electron-photon correlation spectroscopy of quantum materials, single photon
systems, and coherent exciton-polaritonic samples with nanometric resolution.

theoretical point of view, the adversary and the online algorithm are players
in a two-player game. By applying this view on combinatorial graph problems,
especially on problems where the solution is a subset of the vertices, we
analyze their complexity. For this, we introduce a framework based on gadget
reductions from 3-Satisfiability and extend it to an online setting where the
graph is a priori known by a map. This is done by identifying a set of rules
for the reductions and providing schemes for gadgets. The extension of the

KWS models when labelled data is scarce. We pretrain three compact
transformer-based KWS models using Data2Vec, and fine-tune them on a
label-deficient setup of the Google Speech Commands data set. It is found that
Data2Vec pretraining leads to a significant increase in accuracy, with
label-deficient scenarios showing an improvement of 8.22% 11.18% absolute
accuracy.

that seeks to maximize rewards in an environment. The learning typically
happens through trial and error using explorative methods, such as
epsilon-greedy. There are two approaches, model-based and model-free
reinforcement learning, that show concrete results in several disciplines.
Model-based RL learns a model of the environment for learning the policy while
model-free approaches are fully explorative and exploitative without
considering the underlying environment dynamics. Model-free RL works
conceptually well in simulated environments, and empirical evidence suggests
that trial and error lead to a near-optimal behavior with enough training. On
the other hand, model-based RL aims to be sample efficient, and studies show
that it requires far less training in the real environment for learning a good
policy.
  A significant challenge with RL is that it relies on a well-defined reward
function to work well for complex environments and such a reward function is
challenging to define. Goal-Directed RL is an alternative method that learns an
intrinsic reward function with emphasis on a few explored trajectories that
reveals the path to the goal state.
  This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for predicting
the distance between two states in a Markov Decision Process. The learned
distance function works as an intrinsic reward that fuels the agent's learning.
Using the distance-metric as a reward, we show that the algorithm performs
comparably to model-free RL while having significantly better
sample-efficiently in several test environments.

key assumption in underlying forged region localization is that there remains a
difference of feature distribution between untampered and manipulated regions

we aim to leverage this difference of feature distribution to aid in image

strong chemisorption leads to a loss of the molecule-specific features in the

rocket bodies being abandoned in orbit and eventually returning to Earth in an
uncontrolled manner. When they do so, between 20 and 40% of their mass survives
the heat of atmospheric reentry. Many of the surviving pieces are heavy enough
to pose serious risks to people, on land, at sea, and in airplanes.
  There is no international consensus on the acceptable level of risk from
reentering space objects. This is sometimes a point of contention, such as when
a 20 tonne Long March 5B core stage made an uncontrolled reentry in May 2021.
Some regulators, including the US, France, and ESA, have implemented a 1 in
10,000 acceptable casualty risk (i.e., statistical threat to human life)
threshold from reentering space objects. We argue that this threshold ignores
the cumulative effect of the rapidly increasing number of rocket launches. It
also fails to address low risk, high consequence outcomes, such as a rocket
stage crashing into a high-density city or a large passenger aircraft. In the
latter case, even a small piece could cause hundreds of casualties. Compounding
this, the threshold is frequently ignored or waived when the costs of adherence
are deemed excessive.
  We analyse the rocket bodies that reentered the atmosphere from 1992 - 2021
and model the associated cumulative casualty expectation. We then extrapolate
this trend into the near future (2022 - 2032), modelling the potential risk to
the global population from uncontrolled rocket body reentries. We also analyse
the population of rocket bodies that are currently in orbit and expected to
deorbit soon, and find that the risk distribution is significantly weighted to
latitudes close to the equator. This represents a disproportionate burden of
casualty risk imposed on the countries of the Global South by major spacefaring
countries.

  Materials and Methods: 17,537 chest x-ray radiographs (CXRs) from 3,264

from a single site for AI model development. The generalizability of the

  Results: The AI model trained using a single-source clinical dataset achieved
an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.84) when applied to the internal temporal test

  Conclusion: COVID-19 classification AI model trained using well-curated data

aggregation on the server for federated learning. It is generally assumed that
there are abundant public unlabeled data on the server. However, in reality,
there exists a domain discrepancy between the datasets of the server domain and
a client domain, which limits the performance of knowledge distillation. How to
improve the aggregation under such a domain discrepancy setting is still an
open problem. In this paper, we first analyze the generalization bound of the
aggregation model produced from knowledge distillation for the client domains,
and then describe two challenges, server-to-client discrepancy and
client-to-client discrepancy, brought to the aggregation model by the domain
discrepancies. Following our analysis, we propose an adaptive knowledge
aggregation algorithm FedD3A based on domain discrepancy aware distillation to
lower the bound. FedD3A performs adaptive weighting at the sample level in each
round of FL. For each sample in the server domain, only the client models of
its similar domains will be selected for playing the teacher role. To achieve
this, we show that the discrepancy between the server-side sample and the
client domain can be approximately measured using a subspace projection matrix
calculated on each client without accessing its raw data. The server can thus
leverage the projection matrices from multiple clients to assign weights to the
corresponding teacher models for each server-side sample. We validate FedD3A on
two popular cross-domain datasets and show that it outperforms the compared
competitors in both cross-silo and cross-device FL settings.

networks for classification tasks, many alternative losses have been developed
to obtain better empirical performance. Among them, which one is the best to
use is still a mystery, because there seem to be multiple factors affecting the
answer, such as properties of the dataset, the choice of network architecture,
and so on. This paper studies the choice of loss function by examining the
last-layer features of deep networks, drawing inspiration from a recent line
work showing that the global optimal solution of CE and mean-square-error (MSE)
losses exhibits a Neural Collapse phenomenon. That is, for sufficiently large
networks trained until convergence, (i) all features of the same class collapse
to the corresponding class mean and (ii) the means associated with different
classes are in a configuration where their pairwise distances are all equal and
maximized. We extend such results and show through global solution and
landscape analyses that a broad family of loss functions including commonly
used label smoothing (LS) and focal loss (FL) exhibits Neural Collapse. Hence,
all relevant losses(i.e., CE, LS, FL, MSE) produce equivalent features on
training data. Based on the unconstrained feature model assumption, we provide
either the global landscape analysis for LS loss or the local landscape
analysis for FL loss and show that the (only!) global minimizers are neural
collapse solutions, while all other critical points are strict saddles whose
Hessian exhibit negative curvature directions either in the global scope for LS
loss or in the local scope for FL loss near the optimal solution. The
experiments further show that Neural Collapse features obtained from all
relevant losses lead to largely identical performance on test data as well,
provided that the network is sufficiently large and trained until convergence.

equations for second order integrals of motion in the cylindrical coordinates
and we find all quadratically integrable systems of the cylindrical type. Among
them we search for systems admitting additional integrals of motion. We find
all systems with an additional first order integral both in classical and

and no other exist. We also find all systems with an additional integral of
type $L^2+\ldots$, respectively $L_y p_y-L_x p_y+\ldots$, of which the majority
is new to the literature. All found superintegrable systems admit the first
order integral $L_z$ and we solve their Hamilton-Jacobi and Schr\""odinger
equations by separation of variables in the cylindrical coordinates, for the
first order systems in the Cartesian coordinates as well.

such as image classification, speech recognition, and game playing. However,
these breakthroughs are often difficult to translate into real-world
engineering systems because deep learning models require a massive number of
training samples, which are costly to obtain in practice. To address labeled
data scarcity, few-shot meta-learning optimizes learning algorithms that can
efficiently adapt to new tasks quickly. While meta-learning is gaining
significant interest in the machine learning literature, its working principles
and theoretic fundamentals are not as well understood in the engineering
community.
  This review monograph provides an introduction to meta-learning by covering
principles, algorithms, theory, and engineering applications. After introducing
meta-learning in comparison with conventional and joint learning, we describe
the main meta-learning algorithms, as well as a general bilevel optimization
framework for the definition of meta-learning techniques. Then, we summarize
known results on the generalization capabilities of meta-learning from a
statistical learning viewpoint. Applications to communication systems,
including decoding and power allocation, are discussed next, followed by an
introduction to aspects related to the integration of meta-learning with
emerging computing technologies, namely neuromorphic and quantum computing. The
monograph is concluded with an overview of open research challenges.

the system from the point of view of a rotating frame, changes the solutions of

depend on the angular velocity of the rotating frame, $\Omega$, and also on the
parameter $\beta$, which codifies the presence of the screw dislocation.
Particularly, with respect to the energy spectrum of the system the changing is
such that when $\Omega$ increases, the energy can increase or decrease
depending on the values we assign to the eigenvalues of the angular and linear
momenta. Additionally, we observe that the values of the parameter $\beta$ that
characterizes the screw dislocation causes a shift in the energy spectrum.

the gH-Hadamard derivative of the maximum of all finite comparable IVFs is the

be useful to check the convexity of an IVF and to characterize efficient points
of an optimization problem with IVF. For a convex IVF, we prove that if at a
point the gH-Hadamard derivative does not dominate to zero, then the point is
an efficient point. Further, it is proved that at an efficient point, the

is a critical task in binary analysis. It is challenging as statically
computing precise alias information is undecidable in theory. The problem
aggravates at the binary level due to the presence of compiler optimizations
and the absence of symbols and types. Existing approaches either produce
significant spurious dependencies due to conservative analysis or scale poorly
to complex binaries.
  We present a new machine-learning-based approach to predict memory
dependencies by exploiting the model's learned knowledge about how binary
programs execute. Our approach features (i) a self-supervised procedure that
pretrains a neural net to reason over binary code and its dynamic value flows
through memory addresses, followed by (ii) supervised finetuning to infer the
memory dependencies statically. To facilitate efficient learning, we develop
dedicated neural architectures to encode the heterogeneous inputs (i.e., code,
data values, and memory addresses from traces) with specific modules and fuse
them with a composition learning strategy.
  We implement our approach in NeuDep and evaluate it on 41 popular software
projects compiled by 2 compilers, 4 optimizations, and 4 obfuscation passes. We
demonstrate that NeuDep is more precise (1.5x) and faster (3.5x) than the
current state-of-the-art. Extensive probing studies on security-critical
reverse engineering tasks suggest that NeuDep understands memory access
patterns, learns function signatures, and is able to match indirect calls. All
these tasks either assist or benefit from inferring memory dependencies.
Notably, NeuDep also outperforms the current state-of-the-art on these tasks.

objective of this systematic literature review is to provide a methodical
overview of the integration of social media in different epidemic-related
contexts. Three research questions were conceptualized for this review,
resulting in over 10000 publications collected in the first PRISMA stage, 129
of which were selected for inclusion. A thematic method-oriented synthesis was
undertaken and identified 5 main themes related to social media enabled
epidemic surveillance, misinformation management, and mental health. Findings
uncover a need for more robust applications of the lessons learned from
epidemic post-mortem documentation. A vast gap exists between retrospective
analysis of epidemic management and result integration in prospective studies.
Harnessing the full potential of social media in epidemic related tasks
requires streamlining the results of epidemic forecasting, public opinion
understanding and misinformation propagation, all while keeping abreast of
potential mental health implications. Pro-active prevention has thus become
vital for epidemic curtailment and containment.

segmentation literature investigates the mechanisms that allow people to
extract events. Event segmentation theory points out that people predict
ongoing activities and observe prediction error signals to find event
boundaries that keep events apart. In this study, we investigated the mechanism
giving rise to this ability by a computational model and accompanying
psychological experiments. Inspired from event segmentation theory and
predictive processing, we introduced a self-supervised model of event
segmentation. This model consists of neural networks that predict the sensory
signal in the next time-step to represent different events, and a cognitive
model that regulates these networks on the basis of their prediction errors. In
order to verify the ability of our model in segmenting events, learning them
during passive observation, and representing them in its internal
representational space, we prepared a video that depicts human behaviors
represented by point-light displays. We compared event segmentation behaviors
of participants and our model with this video in two hierarchical event
segmentation levels. By using point-biserial correlation technique, we
demonstrated that event segmentation decisions of our model correlated with the
responses of participants. Moreover, by approximating representation space of
participants by a similarity-based technique, we showed that our model formed a
similar representation space with those of participants. The result suggests
that our model that tracks the prediction error signals can produce human-like
event boundaries and event representations. Finally, we discussed our
contribution to the literature of event cognition and our understanding of how

paper studies a cobalt based electrochemical sensor for phosphate detection in

detection limits, linearity of response, accuracy and reproducibility in a
single ion solution was conducted. An indirect method was employed to assess
the effect of all of these parameters; the parameter was kept constant, while
the phosphate concertation was varied. Tests on real wastewater samples
verified the effect of the interfering factors, as phosphate measurements from
three different sampling points (influent, activated sludge mixed liquors and
effluent) did not correlate favourably with measurements acquired from a
specialised laboratory. The success of this sensor is probably dependent on the
simultaneous measurement of, or the calibration for, interfering parameters.
However, the former approach would most likely require additional probes to
measure these interfering parameters and the latter would probably require a
complex calibrating matrix to account for all the interfering parameters.
Nonetheless, variations of such sensors reviewed in this paper and their
