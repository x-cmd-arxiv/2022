important for fields such as spectroscopy and optical communications. Dark
solitons which are coherent states of optical frequency combs in normal
dispersion microresonators can extend the operating wavelength and be excited
via intermodal coupling. They have been investigated over the last decade due
to their high conversion efficiency and deterministic excitation with no need
for dispersion engineering. While the existence and dynamics of dark solitons
has been examined extensively, requirements on the modal interaction for
accessing the soliton state in the presence of a strong Raman interaction at
near-IR wavelengths has been less explored. Here, analysis on the parametric
and Raman gain in a silica microresonator is performed, revealing that
parametric gain can be created by an additional frequency due to modal
interaction and exceed the Raman gain. More complex interaction dynamics of the
parametric and stimulated Raman scattering process is studied using numerical
simulations based on the Lugiato-Lefever equation. It is found that exciting a
dark soliton requires not only appropriate modal coupling but also a range of
pump powers. The existence range of the dark soliton is analyzed as a function
of pump power and detuning for given modal coupling conditions. We anticipate
these results will benefit fields requiring optical frequency combs with high
efficiency and selectable wavelength in a material with a strong Raman gain.

for transportation, medicine, and security, it becomes increasingly important
that we develop methods to analyze their behavior to ensure that they are safe
to use within these contexts. The methods used in this paper seek to certify
safety for closed-loop systems with neural network controllers, i.e., neural
feedback loops, using backward reachability analysis. Namely, we calculate
backprojection (BP) set over-approximations (BPOAs), i.e., sets of states that
lead to a given target set that bounds dangerous regions of the state space.
The system's safety can then be certified by checking its current state against
the BPOAs. While over-approximating BPs is significantly faster than
calculating exact BP sets, solving the relaxed problem leads to
conservativeness. To combat conservativeness, partitioning strategies can be
used to split the problem into a set of sub-problems, each less conservative
than the unpartitioned problem. We introduce a hybrid partitioning method that
uses both target set partitioning (TSP) and backreachable set partitioning
(BRSP) to overcome a lower bound on estimation error that is present when using
BRSP. Numerical results demonstrate a near order-of-magnitude reduction in
estimation error compared to BRSP or TSP given the same computation time.

  GHz frequencies and its dependence on redshift and stellar mass","18 pages, 17 figures, submitted to A&A",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) of star-forming galaxies can be used to
estimate their star formation rate (SFR) based on the radio continuum
luminosity at MHz-GHz frequencies. For application in future deep radio
surveys, it is crucial to know whether the IRRC persists at high redshift z.
Delvecchio et al. (2020) observed that the 1.4 GHz IRRC correlation of
star-forming galaxies is nearly z-invariant up to z~4, but depends strongly on
the stellar mass M_star. This should be taken into account for SFR calibrations
based on radio luminosity. To understand the physical cause of the
M_star-dependence of the IRRC and its properties at higher z, we construct a
phenomenological model for galactic radio emission involving magnetic fields
generated by a small-scale dynamo, a steady-state cosmic ray population, as
well as observed scaling relations that reduce the number of free parameters.
The best agreement between the model and the characteristics of the IRRC
observed by Delvecchio et al. (2020) is found when the efficiency of the
SN-driven turbulence is 5 % and when saturation of the small-scale dynamo
occurs once 10 % of the kinetic energy is converted into magnetic energy. The
observed dependence of the IRRC on M_star and z can be reproduced with our
model. For galaxies with intermediate to high (M_star ~ 10^9.5 - 10^11 M_sun)
stellar masses, our model results in a IRRC which is nearly independent of z.
For galaxies with lower masses (M_star ~ 10^8.5 M_sun), we find that the
IR-to-radio flux ratio increases with increasing redshift. This matches the
observational data in that mass bin which, however, only extends to z~1.5. The
increase of the IR-to-radio flux ratio for low-mass galaxies at z>1.5 that is
predicted by our model could be tested with future deep radio observations.

resolve the structure of envelopes with 1600 au (4"") resolution, a factor of
3-5 improvement in angular resolution over existing single-dish 870 $\mu$m

Millimeter/submillimeter Array 12 m array observations at 870 $\mu$m with
$\sim$0.1 (40 au) resolution. Using the 12 m data to measure the fluxes from
disks and the ACA data within 2500 au to measure the combined disk plus
envelope fluxes, we calculate the 12 m/ACA 870 $\mu$m flux ratios. Our sample
shows a clear evolution in this ratio. Class 0 protostars are mostly
envelope-dominated with ratios $<$0.5. In contrast, Flat Spectrum protostars
are primarily disk-dominated with ratios near 1, although with a number of
face-on protostars dominated by their envelopes. Class I protostars span the
range from envelope to disk-dominated. The increase in ratio is accompanied by
a decrease in the envelope fluxes and estimated mass infall rates. We estimate
that 80$\%$ of the mass is accreted during the envelope-dominated phase. We
find that the 12 m/ACA flux ratio is an evolutionary indicator that largely
avoids the inclination and foreground extinction dependence of spectral energy

If $A_n$ is a Wigner matrix with entries in the domain of attraction of a

Our main result shows that the empirical spectral measure of $L_n$ converges
almost surely to a deterministic limit. A key step in the proof is to use the

$L_n$ converges in an appropriate sense. This operator leads to a recursive
distributional equation uniquely describing the Stieltjes transform of the

To this end, we present AVLEN~ -- an interactive agent for

tasks, the goal of our embodied agent is to localize an audio event via
navigating the 3D visual world; however, the agent may also seek help from a
human (oracle), where the assistance is provided in free-form natural language.
To realize these abilities, AVLEN uses a multimodal hierarchical reinforcement
learning backbone that learns: (a) high-level policies to choose either
audio-cues for navigation or to query the oracle, and (b) lower-level policies
to select navigation actions based on its audio-visual and language inputs. The
policies are trained via rewarding for the success on the navigation task while
minimizing the number of queries to the oracle. To empirically evaluate AVLEN,

transit data sets. The few planets that have been discovered in young clusters
generally orbit stars too faint for any detailed follow-up analysis. Here we
present the characterization of a new mini-Neptune planet orbiting the bright
(V=9) and nearby K2 dwarf star, HD 18599. The planet candidate was originally
detected in TESS light curves from Sectors 2, 3, 29, and 30, with an orbital
period of 4.138~days. We then used HARPS and FEROS radial velocities, to find
the companion mass to be 25.5$\pm$4.6~M$_\oplus$. When we combine this with the
measured radius from TESS, of 2.70$\pm$0.05~R$_\oplus$, we find a high
planetary density of 7.1$\pm$1.4~g cm$^{-3}$. The planet exists on the edge of
the Neptune Desert and is the first young planet (300 Myr) of its type to
inhabit this region. Structure models argue for a bulk composition to consist
of 23% H$_2$O and 77% Rock and Iron. Future follow-up with large ground- and
space-based telescopes can enable us to begin to understand in detail the
characteristics of young Neptunes in the galaxy.

particle-particle geometric constraints, Monte Carlo simulations that look at
how these geometric constraints play out over extended dispersions of many
particles, and Molecular Dynamics simulations that allow particles to interact
to form random loose and close packings. We investigate the dependence of
critical random loose and close packing fractions on particle parameters,
finding that both values tend to increase with opening aperture (as expected)
and, in general, decrease with increasing corner sharpness. The identified
packing fractions are compared with the mean-field prediction of the Random

correlations between particle orientations. The complex interaction of spatial
proximity and orientational alignment is explored using a generalized
Spatio-Orientational Distribution Area (SODA) plot. Higher density packings are
achieved through particles assuming a small number of preferred configurations

dissipative systems described by quadratic fermionic Liouvillian operators of
the Lindblad form. The Hamiltonian dynamics is modeled by a generic random
quadratic operator, i.e., as a featureless superconductor of class D, whereas
the Markovian dissipation is described by $M$ random linear jump operators. By
varying the dissipation strength and the ratio of dissipative channels per
fermion, $m=M/(2N_F)$, we find two distinct phases where the support of the
single-particle spectrum has one or two connected components. In the strongly
dissipative regime, this transition occurs for $m=1/2$ and is concomitant with
a qualitative change in both the steady-state and the spectral gap that rules
the large-time dynamics. Above this threshold, the spectral gap and the
steady-state purity qualitatively agree with the fully generic (i.e.,
non-quadratic) case studied recently. Below $m=1/2$, the spectral gap closes in
the thermodynamic limit and the steady-state decouples into an ergodic and a
nonergodic sector yielding a non-monotonic steady-state purity as a function of
the dissipation strength. Our results show that some of the universal features
previously observed for fully random Liouvillians are generic for a
sufficiently large number of jump operators. On the other hand, if the number
of dissipation channels is decreased the system can exhibit nonergodic
features, rendering it possible to suppress dissipation in protected subspaces
even in the presence of strong system-environment coupling.

fibre in a confining flexible ring. This system represents a paradigm for a
variety of biological, medical, and engineering problems. We consider a
simplified geometry in which initially the container is a circular ring of
radius $R$. Quasi-static growth is then studied by solving the equilibrium
equations as the fibre length $l$ increases, starting from $l = 2R$.
Considering both the fibre and the ring as inextensible and unshearable, we
find that beyond a critical length, which depends on the relative bending
stiffness, the fibre buckles. Furthermore, as the fibre grows further it folds,
distorting the ring until it induces a break in mirror symmetry at $l>2 \pi R$.
We get that the equilibrium shapes depend only on two dimensionless parameters:
the length ratio $\mu = l/R$ and the bending stiffnesses ratio $\kappa$. These
findings are also supported by finite element simulation. Finally we
experimentally validate the theoretical results showing a very good
quantitative prediction of the observed buckling and folding regimes at
variable geometrical parameters.

implemented with game updates or signaled through community channels, provide
fertile ground to study the effects of economic interventions on markets. In
this work, we study the effect of in-game economic market interventions,
namely, a transaction tax and an item sink, in Old School RuneScape. Using

contributed to the inflation of luxury good prices, without reducing trade

increases linearly with temperature. Further, for a temperature gradient of

linearly subdivided normals onto unit circle or sphere while new vertex
positions are obtained by updating linearly subdivided vertices along the
directions of the newly subdivided normals. Particularly, the new position of
each linearly subdivided vertex is computed by weighted averages of end points
of circular or helical arcs that interpolate the positions and normals at the
old vertices at one ends and the newly subdivided normal at the other ends.
  The main features of the proposed subdivision schemes are three folds:
  (1) The point-normal (PN) subdivision schemes can reproduce circles, circular
cylinders and spheres using control points and control normals;
  (2) PN subdivision schemes generalized from convergent linear subdivision
schemes converge and can have the same smoothness orders as the linear schemes;

detector can be operated in near-solar environments for a future spaceflight

$\nu$SOL project will fly a 3U CubeSat for testing the detector's passive
shielding design, active vetoing system in a space environment, and the rate of
false double-pulse signals in a space environment. I go into technical detail
about the characterization of the central detector in simuo and in the lab. The
first test is a characterization of energy resolution and calibration through
the use of radioactive sources. We will continue testing by measuring the veto
success rate with ground-level cosmic rays. For the final ground testing, we
will use the Fermilab test beam to characterize the central detector and veto
performance at specific particle energies. Veto performance on the previous
detector design has been promising, and we were able to veto a high percentage
of all particles that can penetrate the passive shielding of the satellite.
These laboratory results and simulations of the CubeSat detector design will
raise the technological readiness level of the planned technological
demonstrator flight to the sun, and the current level of shielding performance
is promising for a successful CubeSat test flight.

artifacts after the scan has already been taken. In this work, we propose a
method capable of retrospectively removing eight common artifacts found in
native-resolution MR imagery. Knowledge of the presence or location of a

following release from a confining lock is investigated using a shallow water
model of the motion, together with a sophisticated boundary condition capturing
the local interaction. The boundary condition permits several overtopping
modes: supercritical, subcritical, and blocked flow. The model is analysed both
mathematically and numerically to reveal aspects of the unsteady motion and to
compute the proportion of the fluid trapped upstream of the barrier. Several
problems are treated. Firstly, the idealised problem of a uniform incident
current is analysed to classify the unsteady dynamical regimes. Then, the
extreme regimes of a very close or distant barrier are tackled, showing the
progression of the interaction through the overtopping modes. Next, the trapped
volume of fluid at late times is investigated numerically, demonstrating
regimes in which the volume is determined purely by volumetric considerations,
and others where transient inertial effects are significant. For a Boussinesq
gravity current, even when the volume of the confined region behind the barrier
is equal to the fluid volume, $30\%$ of the fluid escapes the domain, and a
confined volume $3$ times larger is required for the overtopped volume to be
negligible. For a subaerial dam-break flow, the proportion that escapes is in
excess of $60\%$ when the confined volume equals the fluid volume, and a
barrier as tall as the initial release is required for negligible overtopping.
Finally, we compare our predictions to experiments, showing a good agreement

implementation of the evolution operator is proportional to the lattice size.
The algorithm allows efficient $\phi^4$ state preparation for a large range of
input parameters in both the normal and broken-symmetry phases. The states are
prepared using a combination of variational and adiabatic evolution methods.
First, the ground state of a local Hamiltonian, which includes the $\phi^4$
self-interaction, is prepared using short variational circuits. Next, this
state is evolved by switching on the coupling between the lattice sites
adiabatically. The parameters defining the local Hamiltonian are adjustable and
constitute the input of our algorithm. We present a method to optimize these

preparation. For preparing broken-symmetry states, the adiabatic evolution
problems caused by crossing the phase transition critical line and by the
degeneracy of the broken-symmetry ground state can be addressed using an
auxiliary external field which gradually turns off during the adiabatic
process. We show that the time dependence of the external field during the
adiabatic evolution is important for addressing the broken-symmetry ground
state degeneracy. The adiabatic time dependence on the inverse error tolerance
can be reduced from quadratic to linear by using a field strength that
decreases exponentially in time relative to one that decreases linearly.

variational inference in GFNs is equivalent to minimizing the trajectory
balance objective when sampling trajectories from the forward model. We
generalize this approach by optimizing a convex combination of the reverse- and
forward KL divergence. This insight suggests variational inference methods can
serve as a means to define a more general family of objectives for training
generative flow networks, for example by incorporating control variates, which
are commonly used in variational inference, to reduce the variance of the

  Operation Selection among Cells","Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) is a popular method for
neural architecture search (NAS), which performs cell-search and utilizes
continuous relaxation to improve the search efficiency via gradient-based
optimization. The main shortcoming of DARTS is performance collapse, where the
discovered architecture suffers from a pattern of declining quality during
search. Performance collapse has become an important topic of research, with
many methods trying to solve the issue through either regularization or
fundamental changes to DARTS. However, the weight-sharing framework used for
cell-search in DARTS and the convergence of architecture parameters has not
been analyzed yet. In this paper, we provide a thorough and novel theoretical
and empirical analysis on DARTS and its point of convergence. We show that
DARTS suffers from a specific structural flaw due to its weight-sharing
framework that limits the convergence of DARTS to saturation points of the
softmax function. This point of convergence gives an unfair advantage to layers
closer to the output in choosing the optimal architecture, causing performance
collapse. We then propose two new regularization terms that aim to prevent
performance collapse by harmonizing operation selection via aligning gradients
of layers. Experimental results on six different search spaces and three
different datasets show that our method ($\Lambda$-DARTS) does indeed prevent
performance collapse, providing justification for our theoretical analysis and
the proposed remedy.

established. Yet, the relevance of orbital dynamical timescales to biological
evolutionary timescales is poorly understood. Given that even minor orbital
changes may place significant pressure on any organisms living on a planet,
dynamical sculpting has important implications for the putative evolution of
life. In this manuscript, we employ a Monte Carlo framework to investigate how
a range of exoplanetary dynamical sculpting timescales affects timescales for
biological evolution. We proceed with minimal assumptions for how dynamical
sculpting proceeds and the emergence and persistence of life. We focus our
investigation on M dwarf stars, the most common exoplanetary hosts in the Milky
Way. We assign dynamical statuses, dependent on stellar age, to a suite of
planetary systems, varying the rate of dynamical disruption within limits that
are consistent with present-day planet demographics. We then simulate the
observed yield of planets according to the completeness of NASA's Kepler and
TESS missions, and investigate the properties of these samples. With this
simplified approach, we find that systems hosting multiple transiting planets
ought to have, on average, shorter dynamically-uninterrupted intervals than
single-transiting systems. However, depending upon the rate of dynamical
sculpting, planets orbiting older stars will exhibit the opposite trend. Even
modest constraints on stellar age would help identify ""older"" stars for which
this holds. The degree of these effects varies, dependent upon both the
intrinsic dynamical demographics of exoplanets and whether we consider planets
detected by NASA's Kepler or TESS missions.

they asymptotically converge to it on a timescale that depends on their mass

galactic nuclei are produced by unstable mass transfer due to Roche lobe
overflow of a low-mass (< 0.5Msun) main-sequence star in a mildly eccentric (e
~ 0.5) orbit. We argue that the QPE emission is powered by circularization
shocks, but not directly by black hole accretion. Our model predicts the
presence of a time-steady accretion disk that is bolometrically brighter than
the time-averaged QPE luminosity, but primarily emits in the extreme-UV. This
is consistent with the quiescent soft X-ray emission detected in between the
eruptions in eROSITA QPE1, QPE2, and GSN 069. Such accretion disks have an
unusual $\nu L_\nu \propto \nu^{12/7}$ optical spectrum. The lifetime of the
bright QPE phase, 100-1000 yrs, is set by mass-loss triggered by ram-pressure
interaction between the star and the accretion disk fed by the star itself. We
show that the stellar orbits needed to explain QPEs can be efficiently created
by the Hills breakup of tight stellar binaries provided that (i) the stellar
binary orbit is tidally hardened before the breakup due to diffusive growth of
the f-mode amplitude, and (ii) the captured star's orbit decays by
gravitational wave emission without significant orbital angular momentum
diffusion (which is the case for black holes less than about a million Msun).
We conclude by discussing the implications of our model for hyper-velocity
stars, extreme mass ratio inspirals, repeating partial TDEs, and related
stellar phenomena in galactic nuclei.

plethora of correlated phases, including ferromagnetism and superconductivity,
in the absence of a moir\'{e} potential. These findings pose an intriguing
question of whether an underlying moir\'{e} potential plays a key role in
determining the phases realizable in tunable two-dimensional quantum materials,
or whether it merely acts as a weak periodic potential that perturbs an
underlying correlated many body state. In this work, employing a Hartree-Fock
mean field analysis, we examine this question theoretically by quantitatively
studying the effects of an hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) substrate on
ABC-stacked trilayer graphene (ABC-TLG). For the topologically trivial regime,
we find that the moir\'{e} potential leads to a strong suppression of the
ferromagnetism of the underlying metal. Further, band insulators appear solely
at full filling of the moir\'{e} unit cell, with a moir\'{e} potential stronger
than is conventionally assumed. Thus the observed correlated insulating phases
in ABC-TLG aligned with h-BN cannot be understood through band folding of the
ferromagnetic metal found without the moir\'{e} potential. For the
topologically non-trivial regime, we discover the appearance of prominent
incompressible states when fractional hole fillings (of the moir\'{e} unit
cell) coincide with the occurrence of fractional-metallic states in the
moir\'{e}-less setting, as well as a slight weakening of the ferromagnetic
nature of the phases; however this once again requires a moir\'{e} potential
stronger than is conventionally assumed. Our findings highlight the importance
of interactions in renormalizing the electronic bandstructure, and emphasizes

  International Conference on Quantum Software (QSW), 2023",,,,"quant-ph cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Any potential application of quantum computing, once encoded as a quantum
circuit, needs to be compiled in order to be executed on a quantum computer.
Deciding which qubit technology, which device, which compiler, and which
corresponding settings are best for the considered problem -- according to a
measure of goodness -- requires expert knowledge and is overwhelming for
end-users from different domains trying to use quantum computing to their
advantage. In this work, we treat the problem as a statistical classification
task and explore the utilization of supervised machine learning techniques to
optimize the compilation of quantum circuits. Based on that, we propose a
framework that, given a quantum circuit, predicts the best combination of these
options and, therefore, automatically makes these decisions for end-users.
Experimental evaluations show that, considering a prototypical setting with
3000 quantum circuits, the proposed framework yields promising results: for
more than three quarters of all unseen test circuits, the best combination of
compilation options is determined. Moreover, for more than 95% of the circuits,
a combination of compilation options within the top-three is determined --
while the median compilation time is reduced by more than one order of
magnitude. Furthermore, the resulting methodology not only provides end-users
with a prediction of the best compilation options, but also provides means to
extract explicit knowledge from the machine learning technique. This knowledge
helps in two ways: it lays the foundation for further applications of machine
learning in this domain and, also, allows one to quickly verify whether a
machine learning algorithm is reasonably trained. The corresponding framework
and the pre-trained classifier are publicly available on GitHub

propagation of such jets through a broad range of progenitors, from stars which
have shed their envelopes to supergiants which have not. We use a
semi-analytical spindown model for the strongly magnetised and rapidly rotating
PNS to investigate the role of central engine properties such as the surface
dipole field strength, initial rotation period, and jet opening angle on the
interactions and dynamical evolution of the jet-cocoon system. With this model,
we determine the properties of the relativistic jet, the mildly-relativistic
cocoon, and the collimation shock in terms of system parameters such as the
time-dependent jet luminosity, injection angle and density profile of the
stellar medium. We also analyse the criteria for a successful jet breakout, the
maximum energy that can be deposited into the cocoon by the relativistic jet,
and structural stability of the magnetised outflow relative to local
instabilities. Lastly, we compute the high-energy neutrino emission as these
magnetised outflows burrow through their progenitors. Precursor neutrinos from
successful GRB jets are unlikely to be detected by IceCube, which is consistent
with the results of previous works. On the other hand, we find high-energy

we analyze a sample of 2937 active galactic nuclei (AGN) with solid redshifts
and sufficient counts determined by simulations. Our results show a population
with median values of spectral index $\Gamma=1.94_{-0.39}^{+0.31}$, column
density log$\,N_{\mathrm{H}}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2}=20.7_{-0.5}^{+1.2}$ and
intrinsic, de-absorbed, 2-10 keV luminosity
log$\,L_{\mathrm{X}}/\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1}=44.0_{-1.0}^{+0.7}$, in the redshift
range 0-4. We derive the intrinsic fraction of AGN that are obscured
($22\leq\mathrm{log}\,N_{\mathrm{H}}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2}<24$), finding a
significant increase in the obscured AGN fraction with redshift and a decline
with increasing luminosity. The average obscured AGN fraction is $57\pm4\%$ for
log$\,L_{\mathrm{X}}/\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1}>43$. This work constrains the AGN
obscuration and spectral shape of the still uncertain high-luminosity and
high-redshift regimes (log$\,L_{\mathrm{X}}/\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1}>45.5$, $z>3$),
where the obscured AGN fraction rises to $64\pm12\%$. We report a luminosity
and density evolution of the X-ray luminosity function, with obscured AGN
dominating at all luminosities at $z>2$ and unobscured sources prevailing at
log$\,L_{\mathrm{X}}/\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1}>45$ at lower redshifts. Our results
agree with evolutionary models in which the bulk of AGN activity is triggered
by gas-rich environments and in a downsizing scenario. Also, the black hole
accretion density (BHAD) is found to evolve similarly to the star formation
rate density, confirming the co-evolution between AGN and host-galaxy, but
suggesting different time scales in their growing history. The derived BHAD
evolution shows that Compton-thick AGN contribute to the accretion history of
AGN as much as all other AGN populations combined.

represent the data using sparsely interacting modules. These models can be more
robust out-of-distribution, computationally efficient, and capable of
sample-efficient adaptation to new data. However, they tend to make
domain-specific assumptions about the data, and present challenges in how
module behavior (i.e., parameterization) and connectivity (i.e., their layout)
can be jointly learned. In this work, we introduce a general purpose, yet
modular neural architecture called Neural Attentive Circuits (NACs) that
jointly learns the parameterization and a sparse connectivity of neural modules
without using domain knowledge. NACs are best understood as the combination of
two systems that are jointly trained end-to-end: one that determines the module
configuration and the other that executes it on an input. We demonstrate
qualitatively that NACs learn diverse and meaningful module configurations on
the NLVR2 dataset without additional supervision. Quantitatively, we show that
by incorporating modularity in this way, NACs improve upon a strong non-modular
baseline in terms of low-shot adaptation on CIFAR and CUBs dataset by about
10%, and OOD robustness on Tiny ImageNet-R by about 2.5%. Further, we find that
NACs can achieve an 8x speedup at inference time while losing less than 3%
performance. Finally, we find NACs to yield competitive results on diverse data
modalities spanning point-cloud classification, symbolic processing and
text-classification from ASCII bytes, thereby confirming its general purpose

This is accomplished by the measurement of structural properties of program
networks in a malicious binary executable dataset. We demonstrate the presence
of Scale-Free properties of network structure for program data dependency and
control flow graphs, and show that data dependency graphs also have Small-World

degree correlation that is structurally disassortative, and that control flow
graphs have a neutral degree assortativity, indicating the use of random graphs
to model the structural properties of program control flow graphs would show
increased accuracy. By providing an increase in feature resolution within
labeled datasets of executable programs we provide a quantitative basis to
interpret the results of classifiers trained on CFG graph features. An increase
in feature resolution allows for the structural properties of program classes

AGN forbidden line emission (commonly associated with the narrow line region)
and the dust mid-IR energy output among the archetypal Palomar-Green quasar
sample and other bright type-1 AGNs drawn from the SDSS, Spitzer and WISE
archives. The AGN mid-IR color differences traced by WISE W2 ($\sim4.6 \mu
m$)$-$W3 ($\sim12 \mu m$) and W2 ($\sim4.6 \mu m$)$-$W4 ($\sim22 \mu m$), and
near-IR to mid-IR SEDs constrained with 2MASS, WISE and Spitzer data have clear
trends with the relative strength of the forbidden line regions traced by the
optical \OIII and mid-IR \OIV emission lines. These observations indicate that,
where the lines are strong, a large fraction of the AGN emission at
$\lambda\gtrsim5 \mu$m comes from dust in the forbidden line regions. We find
that the widely quoted universal AGN template is a result of averaging quasar
SEDs with different levels of polar dust emission above the torus output and
that the typical intrinsic IR SED of compact torus dust emission alone falls
with increasing wavelength past 5 $\mu$m (in $\nu F_\nu$). In addition, the
association of polar dust with the forbidden lines suggests an alternative to
the receding torus hypothesis for the decrease in infrared output with

exact constraint programming optimization model and a greedy heuristic. We
introduce the concept of dual circuits, obtained by exchanging state

optimal qubit-reuse compilation requires the same number of qubits to execute a
circuit as its dual. We illustrate the performance of these algorithms on a
variety of relevant near-term quantum circuits, such as one-dimensional and
two-dimensional time-evolution circuits, and numerically benchmark their
performance on the quantum adiabatic optimization algorithm (QAOA) applied to
the MaxCut problem on random three-regular graphs. To demonstrate the practical
benefit of these techniques, we experimentally realize an 80-qubit QAOA MaxCut

observed to segregate in two stages: they first separate rapidly into two
vertically arranged layers and, then, these layers move axially in opposite
directions, segregating the two species. Here, we conduct experiments to study
the influence on the segregation process of various parameters: the size ratio
of grains, the shaking frequency and the channel's geometry. We find that (a)
segregation quality depends upon shaking frequency and it is possible to find a
unique optimal frequency for segregation, (b) the optimal frequency lowers with
increase in size ratio, (c) segregation is generally poorer when the sidewalls
are more inclined to each other, and (d) segregation is improved when the
sidewalls are axially offset from each other. We then carry out discrete

most massive elliptical galaxies forming largely through dissipationless

slow rotators to exhibit similar changes in slope with increasing $L_K$,
suggesting that low-mass and high-mass slow rotators have different formation

leading to a relation between dynamical mass and luminosity that is well

high timing resolution, which erases spectral information through the

(GRMHD) simulations of advection-dominated accretion flows around non-spinning
black holes (BHs), each over a duration $\sim 3\times 10^5\,GM_{\rm BH}/c^3$.
One model captures the evolution of a weakly magnetized (SANE) disk and the
other a magnetically arrested disk (MAD). Magnetic flux eruptions in the MAD
model push out gas from the disk and launch strong winds with outflow
efficiencies at times reaching $10\%$ of the incoming accretion power. Despite
the substantial power in these winds, average mass outflow rates remain small
out to a radius $\sim100\,GM_{\rm BH}/c^2$, only reaching $\sim 60-80\%$ of the
horizon accretion rate. The average outward angular momentum transport is
primarily radial in both modes of accretion, but with a clear distinction:
magnetic flux eruption-driven disk winds cause a strong vertical flow of
angular momentum in the MAD model, while for the SANE model, the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) moves angular momentum mostly equatorially
through the disk. Further, we find that the MAD state is highly transitory and
non-axisymmetric, with the accretion mode often changing to a SANE-like state
following an eruption before reattaining magnetic flux saturation with time.
The Reynolds stress changes direction during such transitions, with the MAD
(SANE) state showing an inward (outward) stress, possibly pointing to
intermittent MRI-driven accretion in MADs. Pinning down the nature of flux
eruptions using next-generation telescopes will be crucial in understanding the
flow of mass, magnetic flux and angular momentum in sub-Eddington accreting BHs

behavior of materials in numerous fields ranging from nanotechnology to drug
discovery. The most accurate methods in this domain are rooted in
first-principles quantum mechanical calculations such as density functional
theory (DFT). Because these methods have remained computationally prohibitive,
practitioners have traditionally focused on defining physically motivated
closed-form expressions known as empirical interatomic potentials (EIPs) that
approximately model the interactions between atoms in materials. In recent
years, neural network (NN)-based potentials trained on quantum mechanical
(DFT-labeled) data have emerged as a more accurate alternative to conventional
EIPs. However, the generalizability of these models relies heavily on the
amount of labeled training data, which is often still insufficient to generate
models suitable for general-purpose applications. In this paper, we propose two
generic strategies that take advantage of unlabeled training instances to
inject domain knowledge from conventional EIPs to NNs in order to increase
their generalizability. The first strategy, based on weakly supervised
learning, trains an auxiliary classifier on EIPs and selects the
best-performing EIP to generate energies to supplement the ground-truth DFT
energies in training the NN. The second strategy, based on transfer learning,
first pretrains the NN on a large set of easily obtainable EIP energies, and
then fine-tunes it on ground-truth DFT energies. Experimental results on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the first strategy improves baseline NN
performance by 5% to 51% while the second improves baseline performance by up
to 55%. Combining them further boosts performance.

relates these critical points to $\chi_F$. We then argue that the transport of
Andreev states leads to a quantized conductance that probes $\chi_F$. An
experiment is proposed to measure this effect, from which we predict an $I$-$V$

inter-frame label propagation. During training, the two branches are jointly

augmentation by proposing a factorized video generative adversarial network
(FVGAN) to synthesize novel labeled frames for training. When testing, we
employ a multi-source inference mechanism, where the final result for a test
frame is either obtained via the segmentation branch or via propagation from a
nearby key frame. We conduct extensive experiments for body parsing using SPN
on two infant movement video datasets, where SPN coupled with FVGAN achieves
state-of-the-art performance. We further demonstrate that SPN can be easily
adapted to the infant pose estimation task with superior performance. Last but

systems typically rely on expensive human annotation and are designed to
perceive only a handful of predefined object categories. This closed-set

the autonomous vehicle needs to process arbitrarily many types of traffic
participants and their motion behaviors in a highly dynamic world. To address
this difficulty, this paper pioneers a novel and challenging direction, i.e.,
training perception and prediction models to understand open-set moving
objects, with no human supervision. Our proposed framework uses self-learned
flow to trigger an automated meta labeling pipeline to achieve automatic
supervision. 3D detection experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that our
method significantly outperforms classical unsupervised approaches and is even
competitive to the counterpart with supervised scene flow. We further show that
our approach generates highly promising results in open-set 3D detection and
trajectory prediction, confirming its potential in closing the safety gap of
fully supervised systems.

Python toolkit and photodissociation region models for analysis of infrared and
millimeter/submillimeter line and continuum observations obtained by
ground-based and sub-orbital telescopes, and astrophysics space missions.
Photodissociation regions (PDRs) include all of the neutral gas in the ISM
where far-ultraviolet photons dominate the chemistry and/or heating. In regions
of massive star formation, PDRs are created at the boundaries between the H II
regions and neutral molecular cloud, as photons with energies 6 eV $ < h \nu <
$ 13.6 eV photodissociate molecules and photoionize metals. The gas is heated
by photo-electrons from small grains and large molecules and cools mostly
through far-infrared fine-structure lines like [O I] and [C II]. The models are
created from state-of-the art PDR codes that includes molecular freeze-out;
recent collision, chemical, and photo rates; new chemical pathways, such as for
oxygen chemistry; and allow for both clumpy and uniform media. The models
predict the emergent intensities of many spectral lines and FIR continuum. The
tools find the best-fit models to the observations and provide insights into
the physical conditions and chemical makeup of the gas and dust. The PDR
Toolbox enables novel analysis of data from telescopes such as ISO, Spitzer,
Herschel, STO, SOFIA, SWAS, APEX, ALMA, and JWST.

autonomous driving. However, training deep models via conventional supervised
methods requires large datasets which are costly to label. It is critical to
have label-efficient segmentation approaches to scale up the model to new
operational domains or to improve performance on rare cases. While most prior
works focus on indoor scenes, we are one of the first to propose a
label-efficient semantic segmentation pipeline for outdoor scenes with LiDAR
point clouds. Our method co-designs an efficient labeling process with
semi/weakly supervised learning and is applicable to nearly any 3D semantic
segmentation backbones. Specifically, we leverage geometry patterns in outdoor
scenes to have a heuristic pre-segmentation to reduce the manual labeling and
jointly design the learning targets with the labeling process. In the learning
step, we leverage prototype learning to get more descriptive point embeddings
and use multi-scan distillation to exploit richer semantics from temporally
aggregated point clouds to boost the performance of single-scan models.
Evaluated on the SemanticKITTI and the nuScenes datasets, we show that our
proposed method outperforms existing label-efficient methods. With extremely
limited human annotations (e.g., 0.1% point labels), our proposed method is

commercial power than the easiest fusion reaction, namely the deuterium and

and, even at those higher temperatures, the cross section is much smaller.
However, as opposed to tritium, the reactants are both abundant and
non-radioactive. It is also an aneutronic reaction, thus avoiding
radioactivity-inducing neutrons. Economical fusion can only result, however, if
the plasma is nearly ignited; in other words if the fusion power is at least
nearly equal to the power lost due to radiation and thermal conduction. Because
the required temperatures are so high, ignition is thought barely possible for
p-B11, with fusion power exceeding the bremsstrahlung power by only around 3\%.
We show that there is a high upside to changing the natural flow of power in
the reactor, putting more power into protons, and less into the electrons. This
redirection can be done using waves, which tap the alpha particle power and
redirect it into protons through alpha channeling. Using a simple power balance
model, we show that such channeling could reduce the required energy
confinement time for ignition by a factor of 2.6 when energy is channeled into
thermal protons, and a factor of 6.9 when channeled into fast protons near the

down when dark matter particle orbits cross and leads to well-known problems,
e.g. an anomalously large backreaction of small-scale modes onto larger scales
that compromises predictivity. We extend SPT by incorporating second and higher
cumulants generated by orbit crossing. For collisionless matter, their
equations of motion are completely fixed by the Vlasov-Poisson system, and thus
we refer to this approach as Vlasov Perturbation Theory (VPT). Even cumulants
develop a background value, and they enter the hierarchy of coupled equations

spectra of the fluctuations. The latter can be brought into a form that is
formally analogous to SPT, but with an extended set of variables and linear as

linear solutions, which are far richer than in SPT, showing that modes that
cross the dispersion scale set by the second cumulant are highly suppressed. We
derive stability conditions on the background values of even cumulants from the

crucial decoupling property: for fixed total momentum, the kernels becomes
strongly suppressed when any of the individual momenta cross the dispersion
scale into the non-linear regime. This screening of UV modes allows us to
compute non-linear corrections to power spectra even for cosmologies with very
blue power-law input spectra, for which SPT diverges. We compare predictions
for the density and velocity divergence power spectra as well as the bispectrum

discuss the generation of vorticity as well as vector and tensor modes of the

dispersion would lead to a violation of momentum conservation. We verify
momentum conservation when including vorticity, and compute the vorticity power

heterogeneity} refers to the fact that client devices have different system
capabilities. A considerable number of federated optimization methods address
this challenge. In the literature, empirical evaluations usually start
federated training from random initialization. However, in many practical
applications of federated learning, the server has access to proxy data for the
training task that can be used to pre-train a model before starting federated
training. We empirically study the impact of starting from a pre-trained model
in federated learning using four standard federated learning benchmark
datasets. Unsurprisingly, starting from a pre-trained model reduces the
training time required to reach a target error rate and enables the training of
more accurate models (up to 40\%) than is possible when starting from random
initialization. Surprisingly, we also find that starting federated learning
from a pre-trained initialization reduces the effect of both data and system

Discovering interpretable governing equations from measurement data can help us
understand and predict the behavior of complex dynamic systems. Although
extensive work has recently been done in this field, robustly distilling
explicit model forms from very sparse data with considerable noise remains
intractable. Moreover, quantifying and propagating the uncertainty of the
identified system from noisy data is challenging, and relevant literature is
still limited. To bridge this gap, we develop a novel Bayesian spline learning
framework to identify parsimonious governing equations of nonlinear
(spatio)temporal dynamics from sparse, noisy data with quantified uncertainty.
The proposed method utilizes spline basis to handle the data scarcity and
measurement noise, upon which a group of derivatives can be accurately computed
to form a library of candidate model terms. The equation residuals are used to
inform the spline learning in a Bayesian manner, where approximate Bayesian
uncertainty calibration techniques are employed to approximate posterior
distributions of the trainable parameters. To promote the sparsity, an
iterative sequential-threshold Bayesian learning approach is developed, using
the alternative direction optimization strategy to systematically approximate
L0 sparsity constraints. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on multiple
nonlinear dynamical systems governed by canonical ordinary and partial
differential equations, and the merit/superiority of the proposed method is
demonstrated by comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

cost and a significant amount of parameters that need to be learned for each
new domain. Such requirements hinder the use in resource-limited environments
and demand both software and hardware optimization. Multi-domain learning
addresses this problem by adapting to new domains while retaining the knowledge
of the original domain. One limitation of most multi-domain learning approaches
is that they usually are not designed for taking into account the resources

encouraging parameter sharing among domains. Hence, filters that are not used
by any domain can be pruned from the network at test time. The proposed
approach innovates by better adapting to resource-limited devices while being
able to handle multiple domains at test time with fewer parameters and lower
computational complexity than the baseline model.

followed by optimization of an additional layer of neurons that filters

that there is a family of these vertices, parametrized by a continuous

calculated the critical coupling of the phase transition using different values

notoriously challenging problems of over-smoothening and information squashing
along with conventional difficulty caused by vanishing gradients and
over-fitting. Previous works have been primarily focused on the study of
over-smoothening and over-squashing phenomena in training deep GCNs.
Surprisingly, in comparison with CNNs/RNNs, very limited attention has been
given to understanding how healthy gradient flow can benefit the trainability
of deep GCNs. In this paper, firstly, we provide a new perspective of gradient
flow to understand the substandard performance of deep GCNs and hypothesize
that by facilitating healthy gradient flow, we can significantly improve their
trainability, as well as achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) level performance from
vanilla-GCNs. Next, we argue that blindly adopting the Glorot initialization

contrary to ad-hoc addition of skip-connections, we propose to use
gradient-guided dynamic rewiring of vanilla-GCNs} with skip connections. Our
dynamic rewiring method uses the gradient flow within each layer during
training to introduce on-demand skip-connections adaptively. We provide
extensive empirical evidence across multiple datasets that our methods improve

this paper, we propose a novel framework for RL by using Riemannian geometry,

framework is suitable for any policy representation and is independent of the

introduce a geometrically grounded pre- and post-processing step into the
typical RL pipeline, which opens the door to all algorithms designed for
Euclidean space to learn from non-Euclidean data without changes. Experimental
results, obtained both in simulation and on a real robot, support our
hypothesis that learning on the tangent space is more accurate and converges to
a better solution than approximating non-Euclidean data.

is a major AI service required by many fields, including intrusion detection,

Conventional anomaly detection technologies mainly consider the anomaly
detection as a standalone service that is independent of any other network
management functionalities, which cannot be used directly in ubiquitous IoT due
to the resource constrained end nodes and decentralized data distribution. In
this article, we develop an AI-native VHetNets-enabled framework to provide the
anomaly detection service for ubiquitous IoT, whose implementation is assisted
by intelligent network management functionalities. We first discuss the
possibilities of VHetNets used for distributed AI model training to provide
anomaly detection service for ubiquitous IoT, i.e., VHetNets for AI. After
that, we study the application of AI approaches in helping provide automatic
and intelligent network management functionalities for VHetNets, i.e., AI for

detection service. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the
efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed AI-native VHetNets-enabled anomaly

that later formed elsewhere on the comet, all in smooth terrain that primarily
is the result of airfall of coma particles. We have compiled observations of
this region in Hapi by the microwave instrument MIRO on Rosetta, acquired
during October and November 2014. We use thermophysical and radiative transfer
models in order to reproduce the MIRO observations. This allows us to place
constraints on the thermal inertia, diffusivity, chemical composition,

consistent with a solid-state greenhouse effect in airfall material; 2) CO2 ice
is sufficiently close to the surface to have a measurable effect on MIRO
antenna temperatures, and likely is responsible for the pit formation in Hapi
observed by OSIRIS; 3) the pressure at the CO2 sublimation front is
sufficiently strong to expel dust and water ice outwards, and to compress comet

endowed researchers with powerful methods for designing and analyzing classical
communication protocols. NUM has also enabled the development of distributed
algorithms for solving the resource allocation problem, while at the same time
providing certain guarantees, e.g., that of fair treatment, to the users of a
network. We extend here the notion of NUM to quantum networks, and propose
three quantum utility functions -- each incorporating a different entanglement
measure. We aim both to gain an understanding of some of the ways in which
quantum users may perceive utility, as well as to explore structured and
theoretically-motivated methods of simultaneously servicing multiple users in
distributed quantum systems. Using our quantum NUM constructions, we develop an
optimization framework for networks that use the single-photon scheme for
entanglement generation, which enables us to solve the resource allocation
problem while exploring rate-fidelity tradeoffs within the network topologies
that we consider. We learn that two of our utility functions, which are based
on distillable entanglement and secret key fraction, are in close agreement
with each other and produce similar solutions to the optimization problems we
study. Our third utility, based on entanglement negativity, has more favorable
mathematical properties, and tends to place a higher value on the rate at which
users receive entangled resources, compared to the two previous utilities,
which put a higher emphasis on end-to-end fidelity. These contrasting behaviors
thus provide ideas regarding the suitability of quantum network utility
definitions to different quantum applications.

recommendations to their users. These recommendation systems track and profile
users to predict relevant content a user is likely interested in. While the
personalized recommendations provide utility to users, the tracking and
profiling that enables them poses a privacy issue because the platform might
infer potentially sensitive user interests. There is increasing interest in
building privacy-enhancing obfuscation approaches that do not rely on
cooperation from online content platforms. However, existing obfuscation
approaches primarily focus on enhancing privacy but at the same time they
degrade the utility because obfuscation introduces unrelated recommendations.
We design and implement De-Harpo, an obfuscation approach for YouTube's
recommendation system that not only obfuscates a user's video watch history to
protect privacy but then also denoises the video recommendations by YouTube to
preserve their utility. In contrast to prior obfuscation approaches, De-Harpo
adds a denoiser that makes use of a ""secret"" input (i.e., a user's actual watch
history) as well as information that is also available to the adversarial
recommendation system (i.e., obfuscated watch history and corresponding ""noisy""
recommendations). Our large-scale evaluation of De-Harpo shows that it
outperforms the state-of-the-art by a factor of 2x in terms of preserving
utility for the same level of privacy, while maintaining stealthiness and
robustness to de-obfuscation.

making them feasible and successful. In this formulation, users provide
demonstrations and labelled safety ratings from which a safety value function

ATE with continuous treatment is generally non-regular, we leverage the partial

has the same tetragonal structure as the well-known FeAs-based compound
LaOFeAs, meanwhile their electronic structures in the nonmagnetic state are
quite similar. The magnetic ground state of SnOFeSe is predicted to be the
dimer antiferromagnetic (AFM) state, which is energetically only 2.77 (2.15)
meV/Fe lower than the trimer (dimer-trimer-dimer-trimer) AFM state, indicating
that strong magnetic fluctuations might be induced via slight modulation.
Interestingly, SnOFeSe is at the verge of metal-insulator transition in these
low-energy magnetic states, hence bridging the metallic parent compounds of
iron-based superconductors and the insulating ones of cuprate superconductors.
With the reduced dimensionality, monolayer SnOFeSe also shows great
similarities in the electronic and magnetic properties to its bulk phase. Given
that SnOFeSe is adjacent to magnetic frustration and resembles LaOFeAs in both

in physics. The oldest and primary example is that of quantum Hall (QH) edge
channels that propagate along the periphery of two-dimensional electron gases
(2DEGs) under perpendicular magnetic field. Yet, despite 40 years of intensive
studies using a variety of transport and scanning probe techniques, imaging the
real-space structure of QH edge channels has proven difficult, mainly due to
the buried nature of most 2DEGs in semiconductors. Here, we show that QH edge
states in graphene are confined to a few magnetic lengths at the crystal edges
by performing scanning tunneling spectroscopy up to the edge of a graphene
flake on hexagonal boron nitride. These findings indicate that QH edge states
are defined by boundary conditions of vanishing electronic wavefunctions at the
crystal edges, resulting in ideal one-dimensional chiral channels, free of
electrostatic reconstruction. We further evidence a uniform charge carrier
density at the edges, contrasting with conjectures on the existence of
non-topological upstream modes. The absence of electrostatic reconstruction of
quantum Hall edge states has profound implications for the universality of
electron and heat transport experiments in graphene-based systems and other 2D

intelligence. To achieve efficient policy reuse, a Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) agent needs to decide when to reuse and which source policies to reuse.
Previous methods solve this problem by introducing extra components to the
underlying algorithm, such as hierarchical high-level policies over source
policies, or estimations of source policies' value functions on the target
task. However, training these components induces either optimization
non-stationarity or heavy sampling cost, significantly impairing the
effectiveness of transfer. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel policy
reuse algorithm called Critic-gUided Policy reuse (CUP), which avoids training
any extra components and efficiently reuses source policies. CUP utilizes the
critic, a common component in actor-critic methods, to evaluate and choose
source policies. At each state, CUP chooses the source policy that has the
largest one-step improvement over the current target policy, and forms a
guidance policy. The guidance policy is theoretically guaranteed to be a
monotonic improvement over the current target policy. Then the target policy is
regularized to imitate the guidance policy to perform efficient policy search.
Empirical results demonstrate that CUP achieves efficient transfer and
significantly outperforms baseline algorithms.

treat the two aspects, i.e., generic and specific restoration, separately. In
particular, generic restoration attempts to restore the results through general
facial structure prior, while on the one hand, cannot generalize to real-world
degraded observations due to the limited capability of direct CNNs' mappings in
learning blind restoration, and on the other hand, fails to exploit the
identity-specific details. On the contrary, specific restoration aims to
incorporate the identity features from the reference of the same identity, in
which the requirement of proper reference severely limits the application
scenarios. Generally, it is a challenging and intractable task to improve the
photo-realistic performance of blind restoration and adaptively handle the
generic and specific restoration scenarios with a single unified model. Instead
of implicitly learning the mapping from a low-quality image to its high-quality
counterpart, this paper suggests a DMDNet by explicitly memorizing the generic
and specific features through dual dictionaries. First, the generic dictionary
learns the general facial priors from high-quality images of any identity,
while the specific dictionary stores the identity-belonging features for each
person individually. Second, to handle the degraded input with or without
specific reference, dictionary transform module is suggested to read the
relevant details from the dual dictionaries which are subsequently fused into
the input features. Finally, multi-scale dictionaries are leveraged to benefit
the coarse-to-fine restoration. Moreover, a new high-quality dataset, termed
CelebRef-HQ, is constructed to promote the exploration of specific face
restoration in the high-resolution space.

Technically, two typical attributes of the document image are involved in the

motivation arises from the insight that 3D shape provides global unwarping cues
for rectifying a distorted document image while overlooking the local

geometric constraints for local patterns. The learned geometric representation
effectively bridges the distorted image and the ground truth one. Extensive

sample of its kind to date. The counterparts' spectral energy distributions
from rest-frame ultraviolet to near infrared provide photometric redshifts
($1<z<4.5$) and stellar masses ($M_*>10^{10.5}$ Msol), which are similar to
sub-millimeter galaxy (SMG) hosts studied previously. However, our sample is
fainter in submm/mm than the classic SMG samples are, and our sources exhibit a
wider range of properties. They have dust-embedded star-formation rates as low
as 10 Msol yr$^{-1}$, and the sources populate both the star-forming main
sequence and the quiescent categories. The deep NIRCam data allow us to study
the rest-frame near-IR morphologies. Excluding two multiply imaged systems and
one quasar, the majority of the remaining sources are disk-like and show either
little or no disturbance. This suggests that secular growth is a potential
route for the assembly of high-mass disk galaxies. While a few hosts have large
disks, the majority have small disks (median half-mass radius of 1.6 kpc). At
this time, it is unclear whether this is due to the prevalence of small disks
at these redshifts or some unknown selection effects of deep ALMA observations.
A larger sample of ALMA sources with NIRCam observations will be able to

classification, while suffering from the quadratic complexity caused by the
Softmax attention mechanism. Some studies alleviate the computational costs by
reducing the number of tokens in attention calculation, but the complexity is
still quadratic. Another promising way is to replace Softmax attention with
linear attention, which owns linear complexity but presents a clear performance
drop. We find that such a drop in linear attention results from the lack of
attention concentration on critical features. Therefore, we propose a feature
fixation module to reweight the feature importance of the query and key before
computing linear attention. Specifically, we regard the query, key, and value
as various latent representations of the input token, and learn the feature
fixation ratio by aggregating Query-Key-Value information. This is beneficial
for measuring the feature importance comprehensively. Furthermore, we enhance
the feature fixation by neighborhood association, which leverages additional
guidance from spatial and temporal neighbouring tokens. The proposed method
significantly improves the linear attention baseline and achieves
state-of-the-art performance among linear video Transformers on three popular
video classification benchmarks. With fewer parameters and higher efficiency,
our performance is even comparable to some Softmax-based quadratic

(Schmidt-TNS) that efficiently represents the Schmidt decomposition of finite-
and even infinite-size quantum states with non-trivial bipartition boundary.
The key idea is to represent the Schmidt coefficients (i.e., entanglement
spectrum) and transformations in the decomposition to tensor networks (TN's)
with linearly-scaled complexity versus $N$. Specifically, the transformations
are written as the TN's formed by local unitaries, and the Schmidt coefficients
are encoded in a positive-definite matrix product state (MPS). Translational
invariance can be imposed on the TN's and MPS for the infinite-size cases. The
validity of Schmidt-TNS is demonstrated by simulating the ground state of the
quasi-one-dimensional spin model with geometrical frustration. Our results show
that the MPS encoding the Schmidt coefficients is weakly entangled even when
the entanglement entropy of the decomposed state is strong. This justifies the
efficiency of using MPS to encode the Schmidt coefficients, and promises an
exponential speedup on the full-state sampling tasks.

unified comprehensive manifold learning. In this paper, starting from our
previous DGA-DA, we propose a novel DA method, namely Attention Regularized
Laplace Graph-based Domain Adaptation (ARG-DA), to remedy the aforementioned
issues. Specifically, by weighting the importance across different sub-domain
adaptation tasks, we propose the Attention Regularized Laplace Graph for
class-aware DA, thereby generating the attention regularized DA. Furthermore,
using a specifically designed FEEL strategy, our approach dynamically unifies
alignment of the manifold structures across different feature/label spaces,
thus leading to comprehensive manifold learning. Comprehensive experiments are
carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed DA method, which
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art DA methods on 7 standard DA
benchmarks, i.e., 37 cross-domain image classification tasks including object,
face, and digit images. An in-depth analysis of the proposed DA method is also
discussed, including sensitivity, convergence, and robustness.

critical for human immune responses. Designing antigen-specific TCRs,
therefore, represents an important step in adoptive immunotherapy. As
experimental procedures for TCR engineering are expensive, leveraging machine
learning methods to learn and optimize informative TCR representations to
computationally generate antigen-specific candidate TCRs has recently attracted
a surge of interest. In particular, learning representations that isolate
salient (or explanatory) factors to explicitly capture the interplay between
TCR and antigen is crucial for model explainability, training sample
efficiency, and effective conditional TCR modification, and thus is highly
demanding. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to attain such goal. Our
proposed autoencoder model, coined TCR-dAE, aims at generating disentangled
embeddings where different sets of dimensions correspond to generic TCR
sequence backbones and antigen binding-related patterns, respectively. As a
result, the disentangled embedding space formed not only improves
interpretability of the model but also enables one-pass optimization of TCR
sequences conditioned on antigen binding properties. By modifying the
binding-related parts of the embedding, TCR-dAE generates TCR sequences with
enhanced binding affinity while maintaining the backbone of the template TCR.
It outperforms several baseline methods by generating larger amounts of valid
TCR sequences with higher binding affinity to the given antigen. Promisingly,
the functional embeddings constructed by TCR-dAE can also be used as a
signature for distinguishing the peptide-binding property of TCR sequences,
which can further benefit applications such as classification and clustering of
TCR specificity.

symmetrized KL information between the output hypothesis, the pseudo-labeled
dataset, and the labeled dataset. It can be applied to obtain distribution-free
upper and lower bounds on the gen-error. Our findings offer new insights that
the generalization performance of SSL with pseudo-labeling is affected not only
by the information between the output hypothesis and input training data but
also by the information {\em shared} between the {\em labeled} and {\em

two examples -- mean estimation and logistic regression. In particular, we
analyze how the ratio of the number of unlabeled to labeled data $\lambda$
affects the gen-error under both scenarios. As $\lambda$ increases, the
gen-error for mean estimation decreases and then saturates at a value larger
than when all the samples are labeled, and the gap can be quantified {\em

user-item interactions over time. There are two crucial factors when modelling
user preferences for link prediction in dynamic interaction graphs: 1)
collaborative relationship among users and 2) user personalized interaction
patterns. Existing methods often implicitly consider these two factors
together, which may lead to noisy user modelling when the two factors diverge.
In addition, they usually require time-consuming parameter learning with
back-propagation, which is prohibitive for real-time user preference modelling.
To this end, this paper proposes FreeGEM, a parameter-free dynamic graph
embedding method for link prediction. Firstly, to take advantage of the
collaborative relationships, we propose an incremental graph embedding engine
to obtain user/item embeddings, which is an Online-Monitor-Offline architecture
consisting of an Online module to approximately embed users/items over time, a
Monitor module to estimate the approximation error in real time and an Offline
module to calibrate the user/item embeddings when the online approximation
errors exceed a threshold. Meanwhile, we integrate attribute information into
the model, which enables FreeGEM to better model users belonging to some under
represented groups. Secondly, we design a personalized dynamic interaction
pattern modeller, which combines dynamic time decay with attention mechanism to
model user short-term interests. Experimental results on two link prediction
tasks show that FreeGEM can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in accuracy
while achieving over 36X improvement in efficiency. All code and datasets can

  Circuits","13 pages, 14 figures",,,,"quant-ph cs.AR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) are promising to demonstrate quantum
advantages on near-term devices. Designing ansatz, a variational circuit with
parameterized gates, is of paramount importance for VQA as it lays the
foundation for parameter optimizations. Due to the large noise on
Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines, considering circuit size and
real device noise in the ansatz design process is necessary. Unfortunately,
recent works on ansatz design either consider no noise impact or only treat the
real device as a black box with no specific noise information. In this work, we
propose to open the black box by designing specific ansatz tailored for the
qubit topology on target machines. Specifically, we propose a bottom-up
approach to generate topology-specific ansatz. Firstly, we generate
topology-compatible sub-circuits with desirable properties such as high
expressibility and entangling capability. Then, the sub-circuits are combined
together to form an initial ansatz. We further propose circuits stitching to
solve the sparse connectivity issue between sub-circuits, and dynamic circuit
growing to improve the accuracy. The ansatz constructed with this method is
highly flexible and thus we can explore a much larger design space than
previous state-of-the-art method in which all ansatz candidates are strict
subsets of a pre-defined large ansatz. We use a popular VQA algorithm - Quantum
Neural Networks (QNN) for Machine Learning (ML) task as the benchmarks.
Experiments on 14 ML tasks show that under the same performance, the
TopGen-searched ansatz can reduce the circuit depth and the number of CNOT
gates by up to 2 * and 4 * respectively. Experiments on three real quantum
machines demonstrate on average 17% accuracy improvements over baselines.

IRAM-NOEMA interferometer in the highest resolution A-configuration, we resolve
the source into two components separated by $\sim$8 kpc, visible as blue
shifted and red shifted $^{12}$CO(5-4) lines, exhibiting the expected kinematic
properties of a major merger between two gas-rich galaxies. The combined merger
system is traced over 2.3$''$ or 18.3 kpc. Each component of the merger shows
ordered gas motions suggestive of a massive, turbulent disk. We measure the
masses of the blue and red disks as (1.5 $\pm$ 0.2) $\times10^{11}$ M$_\odot$

disk component shows broad wings in the CO line, offset by $\sim$3 kpc from the
disk centroid along the major axis, and extending to velocities $\sim\pm$1000
km $ \rm{s^{-1}}$ from systemic velocity. We interpret this as either a
possible bipolar outflowing component, or more likely a warping or tidal
structure in the CO disk. Comparing the properties of HS170850.1 to other
submillimeter detected galaxies with comparably bright 850$\mu$m luminosities
suggests that ongoing gas-rich mergers, or at least a clustered/group

Three-dimensional densities of a protein or a complex from simulated

We systematically introduced data distortion or defects such as missing
fullness of data, the tumbling effect, and the missing wedge effect into the
simulated volumes, and varied the distance cutoffs in pixels to capture the
varying connectivity between the density cluster centroids in the presence of
defects. A similarity score between the graphs from the simulated volumes and
the graphs transformed from the physical protein structures in point data was
calculated by comparing their network theory order parameters including node
degrees, betweenness centrality, and graph densities. By capturing the
essential topological features defining the heterogeneous morphologies of a
network, we were able to accurately identify proteins and homo-multimeric
complexes from ten topologically distinctive samples without realistic noise
added. Our approach empowers future developments of tomogram processing by

sensitively depend on the laser frequency and show an interesting petal

compression. In CS, an ECG signal is projected onto a small set of random
vectors. Recovering the original signal from such compressed measurements
remains a challenging problem. Traditional recovery methods are based on
solving a regularized minimization problem, where a sparsity-promoting prior is
used. In this paper, we propose an alternative iterative recovery algorithm
based on the Plug-and-Play (PnP) method, which has recently become popular for
imaging problems. In PnP, a powerful denoiser is used to implicitly perform
regularization, instead of using hand-crafted regularizers; this has been found
to be more successful than traditional methods. In this work, we use a PnP
version of the Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm for ECG recovery. To
ensure mathematical convergence of the PnP algorithm, the signal denoiser in
question needs to satisfy some technical conditions. We use a high-quality ECG
signal denoiser fulfilling this condition by learning a Bayesian prior for
small-sized signal patches. This guarantees that the proposed algorithm
converges to a fixed point irrespective of the initialization. Importantly,
through extensive experiments, we show that the reconstruction quality of the
proposed method is superior to that of state-of-the-art methods.

criteria for choosing data from the pool have been proposed in the literature.
However, how to build the pool is less explored. Specifically, most of the
methods assume that a task-specific pool is given for free. In this paper, we
advocate that such a task-specific pool is not always available and propose the
use of a myriad of unlabelled data on the Web for the pool for which active
learning is applied. As the pool is extremely large, it is likely that relevant

  Methods: We developed a method to systematically extract the red clump stars

bins in $\ell \times b$ covering the range $40^\circ \le \ell \le 320^\circ$

it is able to identify and trace the red clump stars to much farther distances
than any optical survey of the Disc. The foreground star contamination in the
selected sample is removed by utilising the accurate astrometric data from Gaia
EDR3.
  Results: We have generated a face-on-view (XY-plane) of the Galaxy depicting
the density distribution and count ratio above and below the Galactic plane.
The resulting over-density of red clump stars traces the continuous morphology
of the Outer arm from the second to the third Galactic quadrant. This is the
first study to map the Outer arms across the disc using red clump stars.
Through this study, we are able to trace the Outer arm well into the 3rd
Galactic quadrant for the first time. Apart from the spiral structures, we also
see a wave-like asymmetry above and below the Galactic plane with respect to
longitudes indicating the warp structure. The warp structure is studied
systematically by tracing the ratio of red clump stars above and below the

asymmetry in the Outer spiral arms confirming that the spiral arms traced by
the older population are also warped, similar to the Disc.

Additionally, we leverage the explanation of the proposed SE-DL system to
detect potential class prediction errors of the system. The proposed SE-DL
system uses a set of concepts to generate the explanation. The concepts are
human-understandable lower-level image features in each input image relevant to
the higher-level class of that image. We present a concept selection
methodology for scoring all concepts and selecting a subset of them based on
their contribution to the error detection performance of the proposed SE-DL

is informative to analysts in many real-world applications. However, a na\""ive
solution based on post-hoc clustering of the outliers detected by any existing
method suffers from two main drawbacks: (a) appropriate hyperparameter values
are commonly unknown for clustering, and most algorithms struggle with clusters
of varying shapes and densities; (b) detection and assignment cannot benefit
from one another. In this paper, we propose D.MCA to $\underline{D}$etect

iteratively, and in-house, by using a novel strategy that prunes entire
micro-clusters out of the training set to improve the performance of the
detection. It also benefits from a novel strategy that avoids clustered
outliers to mask each other, which is a well-known problem in the literature.
Also, D.MCA is designed to be robust to a critical hyperparameter by employing
a hyperensemble ""warm up"" phase. Experiments performed on 16 real-world and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that D.MCA outperforms 8 state-of-the-art

graphs: nodes are randomly sampled from an underlying metric space, and any
pair of nodes is connected if their distance is less than a specified
neighborhood radius. Currently, the literature mostly focuses on uniform
sampling and constant neighborhood radius. However, real-world graphs are
likely to be better represented by a model in which the sampling density and
the neighborhood radius can both vary over the latent space. For instance, in a
social network communities can be modeled as densely sampled areas, and hubs as
nodes with larger neighborhood radius. In this work, we first perform a
rigorous mathematical analysis of this (more general) class of models,
including derivations of the resulting graph shift operators. The key insight
is that graph shift operators should be corrected in order to avoid potential
distortions introduced by the non-uniform sampling. Then, we develop methods to
estimate the unknown sampling density in a self-supervised fashion. Finally, we
present exemplary applications in which the learnt density is used to 1)
correct the graph shift operator and improve performance on a variety of tasks,

the electron's spin angular momentum and its linear momentum over the entire
Fermi surface. While orthogonal spin-momentum locking, such as Rashba
spin-orbit coupling, has been studied for decades and inspired a vast number of
applications, its natural counterpart, the purely parallel spin-momentum
locking, has remained elusive in experiments. Recently, chiral topological
semimetals that host single- and multifold band crossings have been predicted
to realize such parallel locking. Here, we use spin- and angle-resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy to probe spin-momentum locking of a multifold
fermion in the chiral topological semimetal PtGa via the spin-texture of its
topological Fermi-arc surface states. We find that the electron spin of the
Fermi-arcs points orthogonal to their Fermi surface contour for momenta close
to the projection of the bulk multifold fermion, which is consistent with
parallel spin-momentum locking of the latter. We anticipate that our discovery
of parallel spin-momentum locking of multifold fermions will lead to the
integration of chiral topological semimetals in novel spintronic devices, and
the search for spin-dependent superconducting and magnetic instabilities in
these materials.

compression models adopt the traditional hybrid-based coding architecture,
which involves temporal prediction followed by residual coding. However, recent
studies have shown that residual coding is sub-optimal from the
information-theoretic perspective. In addition, most existing models are
optimized with respect to RGB content. Furthermore, they require separate
models for variable-rate coding. To address these issues, this work presents an
attempt to incorporate the conditional inter-frame coding for YUV 4:2:0
content. We introduce a conditional flow-based inter-frame coder to improve the
inter-frame coding efficiency. To adapt our codec to YUV 4:2:0 content, we
adopt a simple strategy of using space-to-depth and depth-to-space conversions.
Lastly, we employ a rate-adaption net to achieve variable-rate coding without
training multiple models. Experimental results show that our model performs
better than x265 on UVG and MCL-JCV datasets in terms of PSNR-YUV. However, on
the more challenging datasets from ISCAS'22 GC, there is still ample room for
improvement. This insufficient performance is due to the lack of inter-frame
coding capability at a large GOP size and can be mitigated by increasing the
model capacity and applying an error propagation-aware training strategy.

point cloud classification, recent UDA methods try to align features across

do not optimize the discriminative power in the target domain in feature space.
In contrast, in this work, we focus on obtaining a discriminative feature space
for the target domain enforcing consistency between a point cloud and its

making it thinner, lighter, and less expensive than a lensed camera. However,
additional complex computation and time are required for image reconstruction.
This work proposes a deep learning model named Raw3dNet that recognizes hand
gestures directly on raw videos captured by a lensless camera without the need
for image restoration. In addition to conserving computational resources, the
reconstruction-free method provides privacy protection. Raw3dNet is a novel
end-to-end deep neural network model for the recognition of hand gestures in
lensless imaging systems. It is created specifically for raw video captured by
a lensless camera and has the ability to properly extract and combine temporal
and spatial features. The network is composed of two stages: 1. spatial feature
extractor (SFE), which enhances the spatial features of each frame prior to
temporal convolution; 2. 3D-ResNet, which implements spatial and temporal
convolution of video streams. The proposed model achieves 98.59% accuracy on
the Cambridge Hand Gesture dataset in the lensless optical experiment, which is
comparable to the lensed-camera result. Additionally, the feasibility of
physical object recognition is assessed. Furtherly, we show that the
recognition can be achieved with respectable accuracy using only a tiny portion
of the original raw data, indicating the potential for reducing data traffic in
cloud computing scenarios.

relevant concepts for nonequilibrium analysis, their association has received
little attention. This paper conducts a systematic comparative analysis of the
relationship between TIR and AIR based on statistical descriptions and
numerical simulations. To simplify the quantification of TIR and AIR, the
amplitude permutation and global information of the associated vector are
combined to produce a joint probability estimation. Chaotic logistic, Henon,
and Lorenz series are generated to evaluate TIR and AIR according to surrogate
theory, and the distributions of joint permutations for these model series are
measured to compare the degree of TIR and AIR. The joint permutation TIR and
AIR are then used to investigate nonequilibrium pathological features in
epileptic electroencephalography data. Test results suggest that epileptic
brain electrical activities, particular those during the onset of seizure,
manifest higher nonequilibrium characteristics. According to the statistical
definitions and targeted pairs of joint permutations in the chaotic model data,
TIR and AIR are fundamentally different nonequilibrium descriptors from time-
and amplitude-reversibility, respectively, and thus require different forms of
numerical analysis. At the same time, TIR and AIR both provide measures for
fluctuation theorems associated with nonequilibrium processes, and have similar
probabilistic differences in the pairs of joint permutations and consistent
outcomes when used to analyze both the model series and real-world signals.
Overall, comparative analysis of TIR and AIR contributes to our understanding
of nonequilibrium features and broadens the scope of quantitative
nonequilibrium measures. Additionally, the construction of joint permutations
contributes to the development of symbolic time series analysis.

exhibiting shape invariance along their self-accelerated propagation in free

square integrable, that is, they carry infinite energy. To circumvent this
drawback, families of so-called finite-energy Airy-type beams have been
proposed in the literature and, in some cases, also implemented in the
laboratory. Here an analysis of the propagation of this type of structured
light beams is presented from a flux trajectory perspective with the purpose to
better understand the mechanisms that make infinite and finite energy beams to
exhibit different behaviors. As it is shown, while the foremost part of the
beam can be clearly and unambiguously associated with the well-known
accelerating term, the rear part of the beam corresponds to a nearly
homogeneous distribution of flow trajectories, particularly for large
propagation distances. This is shown to be related with an effective transfer
of trajectories between adjacent lobes (gradually, from the fore part of the
beam to its rear part), which leads to smearing out the transverse flow along
the rear part of the beam. This is sharp contrast with the situation found in
ideal Airy beams, where trajectories belonging to a given lobe of the intensity
distribution remain the same all along the propagation. The analysis is
supplemented with an also trajectory-based description of Young's experiment
performed with finite-energy Airy beams in order to provide a dynamical
understanding of the autofocusing phenomenon observed with circular Airy beams.

representations of graph-structured data, and one of its most important
applications is semi-supervised node classification. However, in this
application, GNN frameworks tend to fail due to the following issues:
over-smoothing and heterophily. The most popular GNNs are known to be focused
on the message-passing framework, and recent research shows that these GNNs are
often bounded by low-pass filters from a signal processing perspective. We thus
incorporate high-frequency information into GNNs to alleviate this genetic
problem. In this paper, we argue that the complement of the original graph
incorporates a high-pass filter and propose Complement Laplacian Regularization
(CLAR) for an efficient enhancement of high-frequency components. The
experimental results demonstrate that CLAR helps GNNs tackle over-smoothing,
improving the expressiveness of heterophilic graphs, which adds up to 3.6%
improvement over popular baselines and ensures topological robustness.

(NIDSs) severely degrades when deployed on a network with significantly
different feature distributions from the ones of the training dataset. In
various applications, such as computer vision, domain adaptation techniques
have been successful in mitigating the gap between the distributions of the
training and test data. In the case of network intrusion detection however, the
state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches have had limited success.
According to recent studies, as well as our own results, the performance of an
NIDS considerably deteriorates when the `unseen' test dataset does not follow
the training dataset distribution. In some cases, swapping the train and test
datasets makes this even more severe. In order to enhance the generalisibility
of machine learning based network intrusion detection systems, we propose to
extract domain invariant features using adversarial domain adaptation from
multiple network domains, and then apply an unsupervised technique for
recognising abnormalities, i.e., intrusions. More specifically, we train a
domain adversarial neural network on labelled source domains, extract the
domain invariant features, and train a One-Class SVM (OSVM) model to detect
anomalies. At test time, we feedforward the unlabeled test data to the feature
extractor network to project it into a domain invariant space, and then apply
OSVM on the extracted features to achieve our final goal of detecting
intrusions. Our extensive experiments on the NIDS benchmark datasets of
NFv2-CIC-2018 and NFv2-UNSW-NB15 show that our proposed setup demonstrates
superior cross-domain performance in comparison to the previous approaches.

uncertainties. Many efforts have been made to model the decision-making process
of human drivers at the behavior level. However, limited studies explain how
human drivers actively make reliable sequential decisions to complete
interactive driving tasks in an uncertain environment. This paper argues that
human drivers intently search for actions to reduce the uncertainty of their
perception of the environment, i.e., perceptual uncertainty, to a low level
that allows them to make a trustworthy decision easily. This paper provides a
proof of concept framework to empirically reveal that human drivers' perceptual
uncertainty decreases when executing interactive tasks with uncertainties. We
first introduce an explainable-artificial intelligence approach (i.e., SHapley
Additive exPlanation, SHAP) to determine the salient features on which human
drivers make decisions. Then, we use entropy-based measures to quantify the
drivers' perceptual changes in these ranked salient features across the
decision-making process, reflecting the changes in uncertainties. The
validation and verification of our proposed method are conducted in the highway
on-ramp merging scenario with congested traffic using the INTERACTION dataset.
Experimental results support that human drivers intentionally seek information
to reduce their perceptual uncertainties in the number and rank of salient
features of their perception of environments to make a trustworthy decision.

reliable estimates and decisions, especially in high-stakes fields such as
clinical research. The increasing diversity and complexity of data have led
many researchers to develop deep learning (DL)-based imputation techniques. We
conducted a systematic review to evaluate the use of these techniques, with a
particular focus on data types, aiming to assist healthcare researchers from
various disciplines in dealing with missing values.
  Methods: We searched five databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL,
and Scopus) for articles published prior to August 2021 that applied DL-based
models to imputation. We assessed selected publications from four perspectives:
health data types, model backbone (i.e., main architecture), imputation
strategies, and comparison with non-DL-based methods. Based on data types, we
created an evidence map to illustrate the adoption of DL models.
  Results: We included 64 articles, of which tabular static (26.6%, 17/64) and
temporal data (37.5%, 24/64) were the most frequently investigated. We found
that model backbone(s) differed among data types as well as the imputation
strategy. The ""integrated"" strategy, that is, the imputation task being solved
concurrently with downstream tasks, was popular for tabular temporal (50%,
12/24) and multi-modal data (71.4%, 5/7), but limited for other data types.
Moreover, DL-based imputation methods yielded better imputation accuracy in
most studies, compared with non-DL-based methods.
  Conclusion: DL-based imputation models can be customized based on data type,
addressing the corresponding missing patterns, and its associated ""integrated""
strategy can enhance the efficacy of imputation, especially in scenarios where
data is complex. Future research may focus on the portability and fairness of
DL-based models for healthcare data imputation.

bonds, isomerizations, and dynamical supramolecular structures, in
nonequilibrium Green's functions electron transport calculations. Structural
transitions are treated as a stochastic telegraph process, and the primary
quantity of interest is a retarded Green's function averaged over realizations
of a stochastic process. Using the Novikov-Furutsu functional stochastic
calculus method, we derive equations of motion for stochastically averaged
retarded Green's function in closed form. Consequently, we obtain the
expression for electric current averaged over transitions, which depends not
only on probabilities of observing particular molecular structures but also on
the dynamics. However, the proposed method has a significant limitation - we
have to assume that the imaginary parts of retarded self-energies produced by
left and right electrodes are proportional to each other; this significantly
restricts possible applications of the theory. Several examples illustrate the
proposed approach.

indirect effects that quantify effects of hypothetical interventions on

subgraphs to understand the networks. However, traditional community detection
algorithms fail to pinpoint a particular kind of community. This limits its
applicability in real-world networks, e.g., distinguishing fraud groups from
normal ones in transaction networks. Recently, semi-supervised community
detection emerges as a solution. It aims to seek other similar communities in
the network with few labeled communities as training data. Existing works can
be regarded as seed-based: locate seed nodes and then develop communities
around seeds. However, these methods are quite sensitive to the quality of
selected seeds since communities generated around a mis-detected seed may be
irrelevant. Besides, they have individual issues, e.g., inflexibility and high
computational overhead. To address these issues, we propose CLARE, which
consists of two key components, Community Locator and Community Rewriter. Our
idea is that we can locate potential communities and then refine them.
Therefore, the community locator is proposed for quickly locating potential
communities by seeking subgraphs that are similar to training ones in the
network. To further adjust these located communities, we devise the community
rewriter. Enhanced by deep reinforcement learning, it suggests intelligent
decisions, such as adding or dropping nodes, to refine community structures
flexibly. Extensive experiments verify both the effectiveness and efficiency of
our work compared with prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple real-world

stream that takes raw RGB images of both eyes to extract visual features and
optical flow of each eye followed by ternary classification to determine
left/right posterior canal (PC) or other; and (2) pupil detector stream that
detects the pupil when it is classified as Non-PC and classifies the direction

scheme, where the cloud server keeps only one single global model for all the
involved clients for the purpose of model aggregation. However, this scheme
suffers from inferior classification performance, since only one global model

address this issue, this paper presents an efficient FL framework named
FedCross, which adopts a novel multi-to-multi FL training scheme based on our

traditional FL methods, in each round of FL training, FedCross uses a small set

can sufficiently respect the convergence characteristics of clients, thus
leading to much fewer conflicts in tuning the convergence directions of
clients. Finally, in the deployment stage, FedCross forms a global model for
all the clients by performing the federated averaging on the trained immediate

limitation of PLS is the need to have information about potential eavesdroppers

estimating the directions of potential Eves to inform PLS. In our approach, the
ISAC base station (BS) firstly emits an omni-directional waveform to search for
potential Eves' directions by employing the combined Capon and approximate
maximum likelihood (CAML) technique. Using the resulting information about
potential Eves, we formulate secrecy rate expressions, that are a function of
the Eves' estimation accuracy. We then formulate a weighted optimization
problem to simultaneously maximize the secrecy rate and minimize the CRB with
the aid of the artificial noise (AN), and minimize the CRB of targets'/Eves'
estimation. By taking the possible estimation errors into account, we enforce a
beampattern constraint with a wide main beam covering all possible directions
of Eves. This implicates that security needs to be enforced in all these
directions. By improving estimation accuracy, the sensing and security
functionalities provide mutual benefits, resulting in improvement of the mutual
performances with every iteration of the optimization, until convergence. Our
results avail of these mutual benefits and reveal the usefulness of sensing as

elite tournaments have resorted to fast chess tiebreakers. However, these
tiebreakers are vulnerable to strategic manipulation, e.g., in the last game of

pixel into either base classes with abundant training examples or novel classes
with only a handful of (e.g., 1-5) training images per class. Compared to the
widely studied Few-shot Semantic Segmentation FSS, which is limited to
segmenting novel classes only, GFSS is much under-studied despite being more
practical. Existing approach to GFSS is based on classifier parameter fusion
whereby a newly trained novel class classifier and a pre-trained base class
classifier are combined to form a new classifier. As the training data is
dominated by base classes, this approach is inevitably biased towards the base
classes. In this work, we propose a novel Prediction Calibration Network PCN to
address this problem. Instead of fusing the classifier parameters, we fuse the
scores produced separately by the base and novel classifiers. To ensure that
the fused scores are not biased to either the base or novel classes, a new
Transformer-based calibration module is introduced. It is known that the
lower-level features are useful of detecting edge information in an input image
than higher-level features. Thus, we build a cross-attention module that guides
the classifier's final prediction using the fused multi-level features.
However, transformers are computationally demanding. Crucially, to make the
proposed cross-attention module training tractable at the pixel level, this
module is designed based on feature-score cross-covariance and episodically
trained to be generalizable at inference time. Extensive experiments on
PASCAL-$5^{i}$ and COCO-$20^{i}$ show that our PCN outperforms the
state-the-the-art alternatives by large margins.

  Reconstruction of Stereo Endoscopic Images via Adaptive Cross and Parallel

effectively on a few labeled samples. It enables a student model to distill
knowledge from the teacher's predictions of extra unlabeled data. However, such
knowledge flow is typically unidirectional, having the performance vulnerable
to the quality of teacher model. In this paper, we seek to robust 3D
reconstruction of stereo endoscopic images by proposing a novel fashion of
bidirectional learning between two learners, each of which can play both roles
of teacher and student concurrently. Specifically, we introduce two
self-supervisions, i.e., Adaptive Cross Supervision (ACS) and Adaptive Parallel
Supervision (APS), to learn a dual-branch convolutional neural network. The two
branches predict two different disparity probability distributions for the same
position, and output their expectations as disparity values. The learned
knowledge flows across branches along two directions: a cross direction
(disparity guides distribution in ACS) and a parallel direction (disparity
guides disparity in APS). Moreover, each branch also learns confidences to
dynamically refine its provided supervisions. In ACS, the predicted disparity
is softened into a unimodal distribution, and the lower the confidence, the
smoother the distribution. In APS, the incorrect predictions are suppressed by
lowering the weights of those with low confidence. With the adaptive
bidirectional learning, the two branches enjoy well-tuned supervisions, and
eventually converge on a consistent and more accurate disparity estimation. The
extensive and comprehensive experimental results on four public datasets
demonstrate our superior performance over other state-of-the-arts with a
relative decrease of averaged disparity error by at least 9.76%.

  Algorithm","13 pages",,,,"cs.AI cs.CR cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data-driven evolutionary algorithms usually aim to exploit the information
behind a limited amount of data to perform optimization, which have proved to
be successful in solving many complex real-world optimization problems.
However, most data-driven evolutionary algorithms are centralized, causing
privacy and security concerns. Existing federated Bayesian algorithms and
data-driven evolutionary algorithms mainly protect the raw data on each client.
To address this issue, this paper proposes a secure federated data-driven
evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm to protect both the raw
data and the newly infilled solutions obtained by optimizing the acquisition
function conducted on the server. We select the query points on a randomly
selected client at each round of surrogate update by calculating the
acquisition function values of the unobserved points on this client, thereby
reducing the risk of leaking the information about the solution to be sampled.
In addition, since the predicted objective values of each client may contain
sensitive information, we mask the objective values with Diffie-Hellmann-based
noise, and then send only the masked objective values of other clients to the
selected client via the server. Since the calculation of the acquisition
function also requires both the predicted objective value and the uncertainty
of the prediction, the predicted mean objective and uncertainty are normalized
to reduce the influence of noise. Experimental results on a set of widely used
multi-objective optimization benchmarks show that the proposed algorithm can
protect privacy and enhance security with only negligible sacrifice in the
performance of federated data-driven evolutionary optimization.

Time-dependent photoluminescense spectroscopy unveils considerably longer

applications in various branches of science, in particular in statistical
physics, and was mainly constrained to the case of Euclidean spaces. One of its
central concepts, the percolation transition, is defined through the appearance
of the infinite cluster, and therefore cannot be used in compact spaces, such
as the Hilbert space of an N-qubit system. Here we propose its generalization
for the case of a random space covering by hyperspheres, introducing the
concept of a ``maximal cluster"". Our numerical calculations reproduce the
standard power-law relation between the hypersphere radius and the cover
density, but show that as the number of qubits increases, the exponent quickly
vanishes (i.e., the exponentially increasing dimensionality of the Hilbert
space makes its covering by finite-size hyperspheres inefficient). Therefore
the percolation transition is not an efficient model for the behavior of
multiqubit systems, compared to the random walk model in the Hilbert space.
However, our approach to the percolation transition in compact metric spaces
may prove useful for its rigorous treatment in other contexts.

potentially address the potable water crisis. However, despite extensive
research, a key question remains: what is the physical mechanism governing the
condensation from humid air and how significantly does it differ from pure
steam condensation? The answer may help define an optimal combination of the
mode and mechanism of condensation as well as the surface wettability for best
possible water harvesting efficacy. Here we show that this lack of clarity is
due to the differences in heat transfer characteristics during condensation
from pure vapor and humid air environments. Specifically, during condensation
from humid air, the thermal resistance across the condensate is non-dominant
and the energy transfer is controlled by vapor diffusion and condensate
drainage. This leads to filmwise condensation on superhydrophilic surfaces,
offering the highest water collection efficiency. To demonstrate this, we
measured condensation rate on different sets of superhydrophilic and
superhydrophobic surfaces in a wide degree of subcooling (10 - 26 C) and
humidity-ratio differences (5 - 45 g/kg of dry air). The resulting condensation
rate is enhanced by 57 - 333 % on the superhydrophilic surfaces as compared to
the superhydrophobic ones. The findings of this study challenges the nearly
century-old scientific ambiguity about the mechanism of vapor condensation from
humid air. Our findings will lead to the design of efficient atmospheric water

impression generation. However, recent works on this task mainly summarize the
corresponding findings and pay less attention to the radiology images. In
clinical, radiographs can provide more detailed valuable observations to
enhance radiologists' impression writing, especially for complicated cases.
Besides, each sentence in findings usually focuses on single anatomy, so they
only need to be matched to corresponding anatomical regions instead of the
whole image, which is beneficial for textual and visual features alignment.
Therefore, we propose a novel anatomy-enhanced multimodal model to promote
impression generation. In detail, we first construct a set of rules to extract
anatomies and put these prompts into each sentence to highlight anatomy
characteristics. Then, two separate encoders are applied to extract features
from the radiograph and findings. Afterward, we utilize a contrastive learning
module to align these two representations at the overall level and use a
co-attention to fuse them at the sentence level with the help of
anatomy-enhanced sentence representation. Finally, the decoder takes the fused

properties of magnons, which are electrically emitted or absorbed inside

purpose is to experimentally elucidate the pertinent picture behind the
asymmetric electrical variation of the magnon transconductance analogous to an
electric diode. The feature is rooted in the variation of the density of
low-lying spin excitations via an electrical shift of the magnon chemical
potential. As the intensity of the spin transfer increases in the forward
direction (regime of magnon emission), the transport properties of low-energy
magnon go through 3 distinct regimes: \textit{i)} at low currents, where the
spin current is a linear function of the electrical current, the spin transport
is ballistic and set by the film thickness; \textit{ii)} for amplitudes of the
order of the damping compensation threshold, it switches to a highly correlated
regime limited by magnon-magnon relaxation process and marked by a saturation
of the magnon transconductance. Here the main bias, that controls the magnon
density, are thermal fluctuations beneath the emitter. \textit{iii)} As the
temperature under the emitter approaches the Curie temperature, scattering with
high-energy magnons dominates, leading to diffusive transport. We note that
such sequence of transport regimes bears analogy with electron hydrodynamic
transport in ultra-pure media predicted by Radii Gurzhi. This study restricted
to low energy part of the magnon manifold complements part II of this

forms on a space. The 1-formality property of the space may be reinterpreted in
terms of the filtered and graded formality properties of the Malcev Lie algebra
of its fundamental group, while some of the finiteness properties of the space
are mirrored in the finiteness properties of algebraic models associated with
it. In turn, the formality and finiteness properties of algebraic models have
strong implications on the geometry of the cohomology jump loci of the space.

actions of compact Lie groups, and 3-dimensional manifolds.

disordered systems, phase transitions in inference problems, and computational

the spiked tensor model and the generalized linear model. We discuss the random
(non-planted) versions of these problems as prototypical optimization problems,
as well as the planted versions (with a hidden solution) as prototypical
problems in statistical inference and learning. Based on ideas from physics,
many of these problems have transitions where they are believed to jump from
easy (solvable in polynomial time) to hard (requiring exponential time). We
discuss several emerging ideas in theoretical computer science and statistics
that provide rigorous evidence for hardness by proving that large classes of
algorithms fail in the conjectured hard regime. This includes the overlap gap
property, a particular mathematization of clustering or dynamical
symmetry-breaking, which can be used to show that many algorithms that are
local or robust to changes in their input fail. We also discuss the
sum-of-squares hierarchy, which places bounds on proofs or algorithms that use
low-degree polynomials such as standard spectral methods and semidefinite
relaxations, including the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. Throughout the
manuscript, we present connections to the physics of disordered systems and
associated replica symmetry breaking properties.

$2900 \leq T_{\rm eff}\leq 4000\ K$ and stellar mass $0.45\leq M_{\ast}\leq

eclipse analysis, rotation and transit period synchronization tests as well as

are known TESS objects of interest. We obtain an occurrence rate of
$0.27\pm0.09\%$ for hot Jupiters around early-type M dwarfs that satisfy our

Jupiters around early-type M dwarfs is smaller than all measurements for FGK
stars, although they are consistent within 1--2$\sigma$. Combining results from

two types: RL-based and Imitation-based. RL-based methods could in principle
enjoy out-of-distribution generalization but suffer from erroneous off-policy
evaluation. Imitation-based methods avoid off-policy evaluation but are too
conservative to surpass the dataset. In this study, we propose an alternative
approach, inheriting the training stability of imitation-style methods while
still allowing logical out-of-distribution generalization. We decompose the
conventional reward-maximizing policy in offline RL into a guide-policy and an
execute-policy. During training, the guide-poicy and execute-policy are learned
using only data from the dataset, in a supervised and decoupled manner. During
evaluation, the guide-policy guides the execute-policy by telling where it
should go so that the reward can be maximized, serving as the \textit{Prophet}.
By doing so, our algorithm allows \textit{state-compositionality} from the
dataset, rather than \textit{action-compositionality} conducted in prior
imitation-style methods. We dumb this new approach Policy-guided Offline RL
(\texttt{POR}). \texttt{POR} demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on
D4RL, a standard benchmark for offline RL. We also highlight the benefits of
\texttt{POR} in terms of improving with supplementary suboptimal data and
easily adapting to new tasks by only changing the guide-poicy.

in PyTorch, the AnalogVNN framework allows users to convert most digital neural
network models to their analog counterparts with just a few lines of code,
taking full advantage of the open-source optimization, deep learning, and GPU

absence of extraterrestrial settlement in the solar system implies that such
expansionist civilizations do not exist. This argument, often referred to as
the Fermi paradox, typically assumes that expansion would proceed uniformly
through the galaxy, but not all stellar types may be equally useful for a
long-lived civilization. We suggest that low-mass stars, and K-dwarf stars in
particular, would be ideal migration locations for civilizations that originate
in a G-dwarf system. We use a modified form of the Drake Equation to show that
expansion across all low-mass stars could be accomplished in 2 Gyr, which
includes waiting time between expansion waves to allow for a close approach of
a suitable destination star. This would require interstellar travel
capabilities of no more than ~0.3 ly to settle all M-dwarfs and ~2 ly to settle
all K-dwarfs. Even more rapid expansion could occur within 2 Myr, with travel
requirements of ~10 ly to settle all M-dwarfs and ~50 ly to settle all
K-dwarfs. The search for technosignatures in exoplanetary systems can help to
place constraints on the presence of such a ""low-mass Galactic Club"" in the
galaxy today.

developed that will provide insight into distinct modes of understanding, their
strengths and limitations, and the challenge of integrating diverse forms of

the periphery of an extended star network (with $N_B$ branches of length
$L_B$). More specifically, we address here the question of the energy
absorption at the core of the network and how this process can be improved (or
not) by the inclusion of peripheral defects with a tunable energy amplitude
$\Delta$. Our numerical simulations reveal the existence of optimal value of
energy defect $\Delta^*$ which depends on the network architecture. Around this
value, the absorption process presents a strong speedup (i.e. reduction of the
absorption time) provided that $L_B \leq L_B^*$ with $L_B^* \approx
12.5/\ln(N_B) $. Analytical/numerical developments are then conducted to
interpret this feature. We show that the origin of this speedup takes place in
the hybridization of two upper-band excitonic eigenstates. This hybridization
is important when $L_B \leq L_B^*$ and vanishes almost totally when $L_B >
L_B^*$. These structural rules we draw here could represent a potential guide
for the practical design of molecular nano-network dedicated to the realisation
of efficient photo-excitation absorption.

a network of players playing the Prisoner's Dilemma with their neighbours, each

their success. This process is non-deterministic, and mirrors societal
interactions in many relevant aspects. We use it to assess the flexibility,
noise tolerance and real-world adaptability of some well-known strategies.
Furthermore, in the model a new strategy naturally emerges which proves way
more successful than those. We also derive some theoretical parameters that
gauge the success of a strategy in this context.

  Forecastings of Saturations and Pressure in the SACROC Field",,,,,"eess.IV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A machine learning architecture composed of convolutional long short-term
memory (convLSTM) is developed to predict spatio-temporal parameters in the
SACROC oil field, Texas, USA. The spatial parameters are recorded at the end of
each month for 30 years (360 months), approximately 83% (300 months) of which
is used for training and the rest 17% (60 months) is kept for testing. The
samples for the convLSTM models are prepared by choosing ten consecutive frames
as input and ten consecutive frames shifted forward by one frame as output.
Individual models are trained for oil, gas, and water saturations, and pressure
using the Nesterov accelerated adaptive moment estimation (Nadam) optimization
algorithm. A workflow is provided to comprehend the entire process of data
extraction, preprocessing, sample preparation, training, testing of machine
learning models, and error analysis. Overall, the convLSTM for spatio-temporal
prediction shows promising results in predicting spatio-temporal parameters in
porous media.
