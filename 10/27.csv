function as a biological quantum information processor due to its supposedly
long-lived entangled $^{31}$P nuclear spin states. This hypothesis was
challenged by our recent finding that the molecule lacks a well-defined
rotational axis of symmetry -- an essential assumption in the proposal for
Posner-mediated neural processing -- and exists as an asymmetric dynamical
ensemble. Following up, we investigate here the spin dynamics of the molecule's
entangled $^{31}$P nuclear spins within the asymmetric ensemble. Our
simulations show that entanglement between two nuclear spins prepared in a Bell
state in separate Posner molecules decays on a sub-second timescale -- much
faster than previously hypothesized, and not long enough for super-cellular
neuronal processing. Calcium phosphate dimers however, are found to be
surprisingly resilient to decoherence and are able to preserve entangled
nuclear spins for hundreds of seconds, suggesting that neural processing might
occur through them instead.

  Clustering","Accepted on ICCAD 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  This paper introduces a scalable algorithmic framework (HyperEF) for spectral
coarsening (decomposition) of large-scale hypergraphs by exploiting hyperedge
effective resistances. Motivated by the latest theoretical framework for
low-resistance-diameter decomposition of simple graphs, HyperEF aims at
decomposing large hypergraphs into multiple node clusters with only a few
inter-cluster hyperedges. The key component in HyperEF is a nearly-linear time
algorithm for estimating hyperedge effective resistances, which allows
incorporating the latest diffusion-based non-linear quadratic operators defined
on hypergraphs. To achieve good runtime scalability, HyperEF searches within
the Krylov subspace (or approximate eigensubspace) for identifying the
nearly-optimal vectors for approximating the hyperedge effective resistances.
In addition, a node weight propagation scheme for multilevel spectral
hypergraph decomposition has been introduced for achieving even greater node
coarsening ratios. When compared with state-of-the-art hypergraph partitioning
(clustering) methods, extensive experiment results on real-world VLSI designs
show that HyperEF can more effectively coarsen (decompose) hypergraphs without
losing key structural (spectral) properties of the original hypergraphs, while
achieving over $70\times$ runtime speedups over hMetis and $20\times$ speedups
over HyperSF.

negative examples using nine strategies that manipulate the structure of the
underlying mechanisms both with rules, e.g., flip the roles of the entities in
the interaction, and, more importantly, as perturbations via logical

a novel dataset for NLI in the biomedical domain, called BioNLI and benchmark
two state-of-the-art biomedical classifiers. The best result we obtain is
around mid 70s in F1, suggesting the difficulty of the task. Critically, the
performance on the different classes of negative examples varies widely, from
97% F1 on the simple role change negative examples, to barely better than
chance on the negative examples generated using neuro-logic decoding.

has proven to be a promising approach, but despite of all recent research
efforts, many practical and theoretical problems still remain open.
Specifically, noise handling and models, issues of consistency and reliable
estimation under minimisation of the prediction error are the most severe
problems. The latter comes with numerous practical challenges such as explosion
of the computational cost in terms of the number of data samples and the
occurrence of instabilities during optimization. In this paper, we aim to
overcome these issues by proposing a method which uses a truncated prediction
loss and a subspace encoder for state estimation. The truncated prediction loss
is computed by selecting multiple truncated subsections from the time series
and computing the average prediction loss. To obtain a computationally
efficient estimation method that minimizes the truncated prediction loss, a
subspace encoder represented by an artificial neural network is introduced.
This encoder aims to approximate the state reconstructability map of the
estimated model to provide an initial state for each truncated subsection given
past inputs and outputs. By theoretical analysis, we show that, under mild
conditions, the proposed method is locally consistent, increases optimization
stability, and achieves increased data efficiency by allowing for overlap
between the subsections. Lastly, we provide practical insights and user
guidelines employing a numerical example and state-of-the-art benchmark

demonstrate that the U(1) symmetry causes quantum-coherence to persist even

line with this property, we write down a 'restricted' Fokker-Planck equation

permits a classical probability description strictly in the incoherent sector

in terms of a Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskun (FKPP)-equation which couples
the operator with the charge and is valid at all time-scales and for arbitrary

base model on the current frame. By exploiting the simple yet effective tuning
strategy with narrow bands, the proposed method realizes a feasible framework
for handling video sequences on-the-fly with high training efficiency. The
storage overhead induced by using explicit grid representations can be
significantly reduced through the use of model difference based compression. We
also introduce an efficient strategy to further accelerate model optimization
for each frame. Experiments on challenging video sequences demonstrate that our
approach is capable of achieving a training speed of 15 seconds per-frame with
competitive rendering quality, which attains $1000 \times$ speedup over the

participation privacy has been mostly studied for internet voting, where voters
are assumed to own trusted computing devices. Such approaches are inapplicable
to pollsite voting where voters typically vote bare handed. We present an

intriguing effects with no counterparts in Hermitian systems. For instance, in
a two-mode photonic system, by dynamically winding around an exceptional point
(EP) a controlled asymmetric-symmetric mode switching can be realized. That is,
the system can either end up in one of its eigenstates, regardless of the
initial eigenmode, or it can switch between the two states on demand, by simply
controlling the winding direction. However, for multimode systems with
higher-order EPs or multiple low-order EPs, the situation can be more involved,
and the ability to control asymmetric-symmetric mode switching can be impeded,
due to the breakdown of adiabaticity. Here we demonstrate that this difficulty
can be overcome by winding around exceptional curves by additionally crossing
diabolic points. We consider a four-mode $\cal PT$-symmetric bosonic system as
a platform for experimental realization of such a multimode switch. Our work

strategies simply focus on minimizing a loss over nodes in a graph. However,
such simplistic training strategies may be sub-optimal as they neglect that
certain nodes are much harder to make accurate predictions on than others. Here
we present TuneUp, a curriculum learning strategy for better training GNNs.
Crucially, TuneUp trains a GNN in two stages. The first stage aims to produce a
strong base GNN. Such base GNNs tend to perform well on head nodes (nodes with
large degrees) but less so on tail nodes (nodes with small degrees). So, the
second stage of TuneUp specifically focuses on improving prediction on tail
nodes. Concretely, TuneUp synthesizes many additional supervised tail node data
by dropping edges from head nodes and reusing the supervision on the original
head nodes. TuneUp then minimizes the loss over the synthetic tail nodes to
finetune the base GNN. TuneUp is a general training strategy that can be used
with any GNN architecture and any loss, making TuneUp applicable to a wide
range of prediction tasks. Extensive evaluation of TuneUp on two GNN
architectures, three types of prediction tasks, and both inductive and
transductive settings shows that TuneUp significantly improves the performance
of the base GNN on tail nodes, while often even improving the performance on
head nodes, which together leads up to 58.5% relative improvement in GNN
predictive performance. Moreover, TuneUp significantly outperforms its variants

techniques, as well as other specialized methods for tail nodes.

data""), such as YouTube videos. To utilize data other than TTS corpora,
previous studies have selected speech data from the corpora on the basis of
acoustic quality. However, considering that TTS models robust to data noise
have been proposed, we should select data on the basis of its importance as
training data to the given TTS model, not the quality of speech itself. Our
method with a loop of training and evaluation selects training data on the
basis of the automatically predicted quality of synthetic speech of a given TTS
model. Results of evaluations using YouTube data reveal that our method
outperforms the conventional acoustic-quality-based method.

most of the biological constraints present in the human brain and are valid

we will focus on guiding the learning of a biologically plausible generative

based on the Human Image Perception mechanism. We hypothesize that this model's
learning algorithm is not fit for Deep Networks due to its Hebbian-like local
update rule, rendering it incapable of taking full advantage of the
compositional properties that multi-layer networks provide. We propose to
overcome this problem, by providing the network's hidden layers with visual
queues at different resolutions using a Multi-level Data representation. The
results on several image datasets showed the model was able to not only obtain
better overall quality but also a wider diversity in the generated images,
corroborating our intuition that using our proposed heuristic allows the model
to take more advantage of the network's depth growth. More importantly, they
show the unexplored possibilities underlying brain-inspired models and

is formulated as an optimization problem with current and stability limitations
as constraints. Measurements across the grid, transmitted through low-bandwidth

many other topics. However, while economic theory extensively considers
networks, no general framework for their empirical modeling has yet emerged. We
thus introduce two different statistical models for this purpose -- the
Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) and the Additive and Multiplicative
Effects network model (AME). Both model classes can account for network
interdependencies between observations, but differ in how they do so. The ERGM
allows one to explicitly specify and test the influence of particular network
structures, making it a natural choice if one is substantively interested in
estimating endogenous network effects. In contrast, AME captures these effects
by introducing actor-specific latent variables which affect their propensity to
form ties. This makes the model a good choice if the researcher is interested
in capturing the effect of exogenous covariates on tie formation without having
a specific idea of the endogenous dependence structures at play. We introduce
the two model classes and apply them to networks stemming from international
arms trade and foreign exchange activity. Moreover, we provide full replication
materials to facilitate the adoption of these methods in empirical economic
research.

attention to the benefits of abstracting a visual input (e.g., image) into a
structured representation, where entities (people and objects) are nodes
connected by edges specifying their relations. Building these representations,
however, requires expensive manual annotation in the form of images paired with
their scene graphs or frames. These formalisms remain limited in the nature of
entities and relations they can capture. In this paper, we propose to leverage
a widely-used meaning representation in the field of natural language
processing, the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), to address these
shortcomings. Compared to scene graphs, which largely emphasize spatial
relationships, our visual AMR graphs are more linguistically informed, with a
focus on higher-level semantic concepts extrapolated from visual input.
Moreover, they allow us to generate meta-AMR graphs to unify information
contained in multiple image descriptions under one representation. Through
extensive experimentation and analysis, we demonstrate that we can re-purpose
an existing text-to-AMR parser to parse images into AMRs. Our findings point to
important future research directions for improved scene understanding.

result, opens a zero-field gap at the $\Gamma$ point. We observed this gap

study color-kinematics duality and the double copy. These two powerful
properties, actually first noticed in tree-level string amplitudes, simplify
the construction of both gauge and gravity amplitudes. However, their
applicability and limitations are not fully understood. We attempt to construct
a set of color-kinematics dual numerators at one loop and four points for
insertions of operator combinations corresponding to the lowest four
$\zeta_2$-free operator insertions from the open superstring: $\zeta_3$,
$\zeta_5$, $\zeta_3^2$, and $\zeta_7$. We succeed in finding a representation
for the first three in terms of box, triangle, and bubble numerators. In the
case of $\zeta_7$ we find an obstruction to a fully color-dual representation
related to the regularization of bubble-on-external-leg type diagrams. The
simplest regularization approach leads to an overconstrained system, signaling
an incompatability between the chosen regularization and color-kinematics
duality. Using the constructed color-dual numerators, we find two different
Bern-Carrasco-Johansson double copies that produce candidate
closed-string-insertion numerators. Both approaches to the double copy match
the kinematics of the cuts, with relative normalization set by either summing
over both double copies including degeneracy or by including an explicit
prefactor on the double-copy numerator definitions.

foundation of the electrical activity observed in the brain and the rest of the

potential activity has long been a key focus area of electro-chemical neuronal
modeling. Specifically, considering the presence of nodes of Ranvier along the
myelinated axon, single-cable models of the propagation of action potential
have been popular. Building on these models, and considering a secondary
electrical conduction pathway below the myelin sheath, the double-cable model
has been proposed. Such cable theory based treatments have inherent limitations
in their lack of a representation of the spatio-temporal evolution of the
neuronal electro-chemistry. In contrast, a Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) based
electro-diffusive framework accounts for the underlying spatio-temporal ionic
concentration dynamics and is a more comprehensive treatment. In this work, a
high-fidelity implementation of the PNP model is demonstrated. This model is
shown to produce results similar to the cable theory based electrical models,
and in addition, the rich spatio-temporal evolution of the underlying ionic
transport is captured. Novel to this work is the extension of PNP model to
axonal geometries with multiple nodes of Ranvier and multiple variants of the
electro-diffusive model - PNP without myelin, PNP with myelin, and PNP with the
myelin sheath and peri-axonal space. Further, we apply this spatio-temporal
model to numerically estimate conduction velocity in a rat axon. Specifically,
saltatory conduction due to the presence of myelin sheath and the peri-axonal

synthesis. However, they can also be misused and abused to fabricate elaborate
lies, capable of stirring up the public debate. The threat posed by GANs has
sparked the need to discern between genuine content and fabricated one.
Previous studies have tackled this task by using classical machine learning
techniques, such as k-nearest neighbours and eigenfaces, which unfortunately
did not prove very effective. Subsequent methods have focused on leveraging on
frequency decompositions, i.e., discrete cosine transform, wavelets, and
wavelet packets, to preprocess the input features for classifiers. However,
existing approaches only rely on isotropic transformations. We argue that,
since GANs primarily utilize isotropic convolutions to generate their output,
they leave clear traces, their fingerprint, in the coefficient distribution on
sub-bands extracted by anisotropic transformations. We employ the fully
separable wavelet transform and multiwavelets to obtain the anisotropic
features to feed to standard CNN classifiers. Lastly, we find the fully
separable transform capable of improving the state-of-the-art.

gravity and typically derives a notion of distance based on the amount of
mutual information shared across sub-systems. Albeit promising, this program
still faces challenges to describe simple physical systems, such as a maximally
entangled Bell pair that is taken apart while preserving its entanglement. We
propose a solution to this problem: a reminder that quantum systems can have
multiple sectors of independent degrees of freedom, and that each sector can be
entangled. Thus, while one sector can decohere, and decrease the amount of
total mutual information within the system, another sector, e.g. spin, can
remain entangled. We illustrate this with a toy model, showing that only within
the particles' momentum uncertainty there can be considerably more entanglement
than in the spin sector for a single Bell pair. We finish by introducing some
considerations about how spacetime could be tested in the lab in the future.

particular, coordinated by a central processor (CP), a set of remote radio
heads (RRHs) provide communication services to multiple users and sense several
target locations within an ISAC frame. To avoid the severe interference between
the information transmission and the radar echo, we propose to divide the ISAC
frame into a communication phase and a sensing phase. During the communication
phase, the data signal is generated at the CP and then conveyed to the RRHs via
fronthaul links. As for the sensing phase, based on pre-determined RRH-target
pairings, each RRH senses a dedicated target location with a synthesized
highly-directional beam and then transfers the samples of the received echo to
the CP via its fronthaul link for further processing of the sensing
information. Taking into account the limited fronthaul capacity and the
quality-of-service requirements of both communication and sensing, we jointly
optimize the durations of the two phases, the information beamforming, and the
covariance matrix of the sensing signal for minimization of the total energy
consumption over a given finite time horizon. To solve the formulated
non-convex design problem, we develop a low-complexity alternating optimization
algorithm which converges to a suboptimal solution. Simulation results show
that the proposed scheme achieves significant energy savings compared to two
baseline schemes. Moreover, our results reveal that for efficient ISAC in
wireless networks, energy-focused short-duration pulses are favorable for
sensing while low-power long-duration signals are preferable for communication.

central star. This process removes excess angular momentum from the star as
viscosity facilitates the mass and angular momentum transfer within the disc
and its growth. The angular momentum loss rates (AMLR) of Be stars is a subject
of debate in the literature. Through the modelling of the disc formation and
dissipation phases observed from Be stars, their average AMLR can be determined
and this is the goal of this work. We use the viscous decretion disc (VDD)
model to provide a range of the average AMLR for Be stars and compare these
rates with predicted values from the literature. We explore the reasons for
discrepancies between the predicted values of average AMLR using the VDD and
Geneva stellar evolution (GSE) models that were previously reported in
literature and find that the largest differences occur when Be stars are
rotating below their critical speeds. We show that the time over which the mass
reservoir builds up is inversely proportional to the average AMLR. Also, we
determine a revised value of the average AMLR for the Galactic Be star omega
CMa of 4.7x10^36 g cm^2/s^2, which is in better agreement with the values
expected for a typical B2 type star. Finally, the effect of disc truncation due
to the presence of a companion star is investigated and we find that this has a
minimal effect on the average AMLR.

form of 3D signal expression, applying point clouds to the task of dense
correspondence estimation between 3D shapes has not been investigated widely.
Furthermore, even in the few existing 3D point cloud-based methods, an
important and widely acknowledged principle, i.e . one-to-one matching, is
usually ignored. In response, this paper presents a novel end-to-end
learning-based method to estimate the dense correspondence of 3D point clouds,
in which the problem of point matching is formulated as a zero-one assignment
problem to achieve a permutation matching matrix to implement the one-to-one
principle fundamentally. Note that the classical solutions of this assignment
problem are always non-differentiable, which is fatal for deep learning
frameworks. Thus we design a special matching module, which solves a doubly
stochastic matrix at first and then projects this obtained approximate solution
to the desired permutation matrix. Moreover, to guarantee end-to-end learning
and the accuracy of the calculated loss, we calculate the loss from the learned
permutation matrix but propagate the gradient to the doubly stochastic matrix
directly which bypasses the permutation matrix during the backward propagation.
Our method can be applied to both non-rigid and rigid 3D point cloud data and
extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance for dense correspondence learning.

maps only from sparse measurement points obtained by LiDAR. Even though the
depth-only methods have been widely developed, there is still a significant
performance gap with the RGB-guided methods that utilize extra color images. We
find that existing depth-only methods can obtain satisfactory results in the
areas where the measurement points are almost accurate and evenly distributed
(denoted as normal areas), while the performance is limited in the areas where
the foreground and background points are overlapped due to occlusion (denoted
as overlap areas) and the areas where there are no measurement points around
(denoted as blank areas) since the methods have no reliable input information
in these areas. Building upon these observations, we propose an effective
Coupled U-Net (CU-Net) architecture for depth-only completion. Instead of
directly using a large network for regression, we employ the local U-Net to
estimate accurate values in the normal areas and provide the global U-Net with
reliable initial values in the overlap and blank areas. The depth maps
predicted by the two coupled U-Nets are fused by learned confidence maps to
obtain final results. In addition, we propose a confidence-based outlier

However, the matching task aims at describing the corresponding points
consistently across different 3D point clouds. Therefore these too accurate

feature representations of correspondences caused by the unpredictable noise,
partiality, deformation, \etc, in the local geometry. In this paper, we propose
to learn a robust task-specific feature descriptor to consistently describe the
correct point correspondence under interference. Born with an Encoder and a
Dynamic Fusion module, our method EDFNet develops from two aspects. First, we
augment the matchability of correspondences by utilizing their repetitive local
structure. To this end, a special encoder is designed to exploit two input
point clouds jointly for each point descriptor. It not only captures the local
geometry of each point in the current point cloud by convolution, but also
exploits the repetitive structure from paired point cloud by Transformer.
Second, we propose a dynamical fusion module to jointly use different scale
features. There is an inevitable struggle between robustness and
discriminativeness of the single scale feature. Specifically, the small scale
feature is robust since little interference exists in this small receptive
field. But it is not sufficiently discriminative as there are many repetitive
local structures within a point cloud. Thus the resultant descriptors will lead
to many incorrect matches. In contrast, the large scale feature is more
discriminative by integrating more neighborhood information. ...

planet population - has presented many unresolved questions concerning the

of a transiting, ultra-short period hot super-Earth orbiting TOI-1075 (TIC
351601843), a nearby ($d$ = 61.4 pc) late K-/early M-dwarf star, using data
from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The newly discovered
planet has a radius of $1.791^{+0.116}_{-0.081}$ $R_{\oplus}$, and an orbital
period of 0.605 days (14.5 hours). We precisely measure the planet mass to be
$9.95^{+1.36}_{-1.30}$ $M_{\oplus}$ using radial velocity measurements obtained
with the Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS), mounted on the Magellan II
telescope. Our radial velocity data also show a long-term trend, suggesting an
additional planet in the system. While TOI-1075 b is expected to have a
substantial H/He atmosphere given its size relative to the radius gap, its high
density ($9.32^{+2.05}_{-1.85}$ $\rm{g/cm^3}$) is likely inconsistent with this
possibility. We explore TOI-1075 b's location relative to the M-dwarf radius
valley, evaluate the planet's prospects for atmospheric characterization, and
discuss potential planet formation mechanisms. Studying the TOI-1075 system in
the broader context of ultra-short period planetary systems is necessary for
testing planet formation and evolution theories, density enhancing mechanisms,
and for future atmospheric and surface characterization studies via emission

an order of magnitude less massive in stars than the observed galaxy candidates
implying that the stellar mass buildup is more efficient in the early Universe
than predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM models. This in turn would suggest that
structure formation is more enhanced at $z \gtrsim 10$ than predicted by the

reduce the stellar masses of the galaxy candidates alleviating the tension.
Finally, we calculate the galaxy-wide initial mass function (gwIMF) of the

top-heavy for metal-poor starforming galaxies decreasing therewith the stellar

evolution. This can be through cooling of the gas -- which leads to star
formation, or accretion onto the central supermassive black hole -- which fuels
AGN activity and produces powerful feedback. Molecular gas has been detected in
early-type galaxies on scales of just a few tens to hundreds of solar masses by
searching for absorption against their compact radio cores. Using this
technique, ALMA has found absorption in several brightest cluster galaxies,
some of which show molecular gas moving towards their galaxy's core at hundreds
of km/s. In this paper we constrain the location of this absorbing gas by
comparing each galaxy's molecular emission and absorption. In four galaxies,
the absorption properties are consistent with chance alignments between the
continuum and a fraction of the molecular clouds visible in emission. In four
others, the properties of the absorption are inconsistent with this scenario.
In these systems the absorption is likely produced by a separate population of
molecular clouds in close proximity to the galaxy core and with high inward
velocities and velocity dispersions. We thus deduce the existence of two types
of absorber, caused by chance alignments between the radio core and: (i) a
fraction of the molecular clouds visible in emission, and (ii) molecular clouds
close to the AGN, in the process of accretion. We also present the first ALMA
observations of molecular emission in S555, Abell 2390, RXC J1350.3+0940 and

We examine the qualitative and quantitative errors introduced into the

simulated data as well as real data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization
Array (HERA) Phase 1 upper limits. We also introduce a convolutional neural

is capable at inpainting real data without requiring to be retrained. We find
that techniques that incorporate high wavenumbers in delay space in their
modeling are best suited for inpainting over narrowband RFI. We also show that
with our fiducial parameters Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS) and
CLEAN provide the best performance for intermittent ``narrowband'' RFI while
Gaussian Progress Regression (GPR) and Least Squares Spectral Analysis (LSSA)
provide the best performance for larger RFI gaps. However we caution that these
qualitative conclusions are sensitive to the chosen hyperparameters of each
inpainting technique. We find these results to be consistent in both simulated
and real visibilities. We show that all inpainting techniques reliably
reproduce foreground dominated modes in the power spectrum. Since the
inpainting techniques should not be capable of reproducing noise realizations,
we find that the largest errors occur in the noise dominated delay modes. We
show that in the future, as the noise level of the data comes down, CLEAN and
DPSS are most capable of reproducing the fine frequency structure in the
visibilities of HERA data.

constraints improve to $\Omega_m = 0.2985\pm 0.0069$ and $h = 0.6803\pm

one-parameter extensions to $\Lambda$CDM and find that results are consistent

equilibrium is intrinsically challenging due to the amount of information it
requires. We introduce a generalization of the Jastrow ansatz for
time-dependent wavefunctions, that provides an efficient and exact description
of the time-evolution of a variety of systems exhibiting strong correlations.
Exact solutions previously known are characterized by scale invariance, making
the evolution of local correlations, such as the spatial density, self-similar.
However, we find that a complex-valued time-dependent Jastrow ansatz (TDJA) is
not restricted to scale-invariance and can describe processes lacking it. The
associated time evolution is equivalent to the implementation of a shortcut to
adiabaticity (STA) by counterdiabatic driving along a continuous manifold of
quantum states described by a real-valued TDJA. Thus, our results provide the
means to engineer exact STA in strongly-correlated many-body quantum systems
lacking scale invariance. We illustrate our findings in systems with
inverse-square interactions, such as the Calogero-Sutherland and the hyperbolic
models, that are supplemented with pairwise logarithmic interactions. We
further consider the dynamics of bosons subject to both contact and Coulomb
interactions in one dimension, known as the long-range Lieb-Liniger model. Our

at $\approx350$ Mpc. However, none of the LIGO-Virgo detectors were operating
at the time. We show that the gravitational-wave signal from a \grb-like binary
neutron star inspiral in the next LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O4) would be
below the conventional detection threshold, however a coincident gamma-ray
burst observation would provide necessary information to claim a
statistically-significant multimessenger observation. We calculate that with O4
sensitivity, approximately $11\%$ of gamma-ray bursts within 600 Mpc will
produce a confident association between the gravitational-wave binary neutron
star inspiral signature and the prompt gamma-ray signature. This corresponds to
a coincident detection rate of $\unit[0.22^{+8.3}_{-0.22}]{yr^{-1}}$, where the
uncertainties are the 90\% confidence intervals arising from uncertainties in
the absolute merger rate, beaming and jet-launching fractions. These increase
to approximately $34\%$ and $\unit[0.71^{+26.8}_{-0.70}]{yr^{-1}}$ with
proposed O5 sensitivity. We show that the above numbers do not depend
significantly on the number of gravitational-wave observatories operating with
the specific sensitivity. That is, the number of confident joint gamma-ray
burst and gravitational-wave detections is only marginally improved with two or
three detectors operating compared to a single detector. It is therefore worth
considering whether one detector with sufficient sensitivity (post O4) should
remain in sky-watch mode at all times to elucidate the true nature of GRB
211211A-like events, a proposal we discuss in detail.

core-collapse supernova. The physical processes that trigger mass loss in their
atmospheres are still not fully understood. Based on observations of $\alpha$
Ori, a new semi-empirical method to add a wind to hydrostatic model atmospheres
of RSGs was recently developed. We use this method of adding a wind to a MARCS
model atmosphere to compute synthetic observables, comparing the model to
spatially resolved interferometric observations. We present a case study to
model published data of HD 95687 and V602 Car obtained with VLTI/AMBER. We
compute model intensities, spectra and visibilities for different mass-loss
rates using the radiative transfer code Turbospectrum. The models are convolved
to match the different spectral resolutions of the VLTI instruments, studying a
wavelength range of $1.8-5\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ corresponding to the $K$, $L$ and
$M$-bands for GRAVITY and MATISSE data. We compare the model spectra and
visibilities with the published VLTI/AMBER data. The synthetic visibilities
reproduce observed drops in the CO, SiO, and water layers that are not shown in
visibilities based on MARCS models alone. For the case studies, we find that
adding a wind to MARCS with simple radiative equilibrium dramatically improves
the agreement with the visibilities and the spectra. Our results reproduce
observed extended atmospheres up to several stellar radii. This paper shows the
potential of our model to describe extended atmospheres in RSGs: it can
reproduce the shapes of the spectra and visibilities with better accuracy in
the CO and water lines than previous models. The method can be extended to
other wavelength bands for both spectroscopic and interferometric data. We
provide temperature and density stratifications that succeed for the first time
in reproducing observed interferometric properties of RSG atmospheres.

photochemical products in the carbon-rich winds of evolved stars. To address
them, it is imperative to constrain the distributions of such species through
high angular resolution interferometric observations covering multiple
rotational transitions. We used archival ALMA observations to map rotational
lines involving high energy levels of cyanoacetylene (HC$_3$N) toward the inner
envelope (radius <8""/1000 AU) of the carbon star IRC+10216. The observed lines
include the J=28-27, J=30-29, and J=38-37, transitions of HC$_3$N in its ground
vibrational state. In contrast to previous observations of linear carbon chains
toward this AGB star which show extended, hollow emission at 15""-20"" radii
(e.g. C$_4$H, C$_6$H, HC$_5$N), the maps of the HC$_3$N lines here show compact
morphologies comprising various arcs and density enhancements, with significant
emission from gas clumps at an angular distance of ~3"" (350 AU) from the
central AGB star. We compared visibility sampled non-LTE radiative transfer
models with the observed brightness distributions, and derive a fractional
abundance with respect to H$_2$ of $10^{-8}$ for HC$_3$N at the radii probed by
these lines. These results are consistent with enhanced photochemistry
occurring in warm (~200 K) regions of the circumstellar envelope. After
application of a specialized chemical model for IRC+10216, we find evidence
that the enhanced HC$_3$N abundances in the inner wind are most likely due to a
solar-type binary companion initiating photochemistry in this region.

J191$+$86), a new powerful radio-loud quasar (QSO) in the early Universe (z =
5.32). We discovered it by cross-matching the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) radio
catalog at 1.4 GHz with the first data release of the Panoramic Survey
Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS PS1) in the optical. With a
NVSS flux density of 74.2 mJy, PSO J191$+$86 is one of the brightest radio QSO
discovered at z$\sim$5. The intensity of its radio emission is also confirmed
by the very high value of radio loudness (R>300). The observed radio spectrum
of PSO J191$+$86 shows a possible turnover around $\sim$1 GHz (i.e., $\sim$6
GHz in the rest frame), making it a Gigahertz-Peaked Spectrum (GPS) source.
However, variability could affect the real shape of the radio spectrum, since
the data in hand have been taken $\sim$25 years apart. By assuming a peak of
the observed radio spectrum between 1 and 2 GHz (i.e. $\sim$ 6 and 13 GHz in
the rest-frame) we found a linear size of the source of $\sim$10-30 pc and a
corresponding kinetic age of 150-460 yr. This would make PSO J191$+$86 a newly
born radio source. However, the large X-ray luminosity (5.3$\times$10$^{45}$
erg s$^{-1}$), the flat X-ray photon index ($\Gamma_X$=1.32) and the
optical-X-ray spectral index ($\tilde{\alpha_{ox}}$=1.329) are typical of
blazars. This could indicate that the non-thermal emission of PSO J191$+$86 is
Doppler boosted. Further radio observations (both on arcsec and parsec scales)
are necessary to better investigate the nature of this powerful radio QSO.

system decays into waves of Higgs and gauge fields. We explain this phenomenon
by the loss of coherence in the annihilation process. Due to this, the entropy
suppression makes the recreation of a monopole pair highly improbable. We argue
that in a similar regime, analogous behaviour is expected for the heavy quarks
connected by a QCD string. There too, instead of re-stretching a long string

well-sampled around their peaks, providing us an excellent opportunity to
construct a peak luminosity function (LF) of tidal disruption flares (TDFs).
The new construction is necessary particularly considering that the most
updated LF reported in literature has been inferred from only 13 sources from 5
different surveys. Here we present the optical and blackbody LFs calculated by
33 TDFs discovered in the ZTF-I survey. The optical LF can be described by both
a power-law profile $dN/dL_g\propto L_g^{-2.3\pm0.2}$, and a Schechter-like
function. The blackbody LF can be described by a power-law profile $dN/dL_{\rm
bb}\propto L_{\rm bb}^{-2.2\pm0.2}$, shallower than the LF made of previous van
Velzen (2018) sample. A possible low-luminosity turnover in the optical LF
supports an Eddington-limited emission scenario. The drop of volumetric rate at
high luminosity suggests a rate suppression due to direct captures of the black
hole. The total volumetric rate is one order of magnitude lower than the
previous estimation, which is probably not simply caused by the high fraction
post-peak sources (7/13) in the previous sample. Instead, the normalization
step during the previous LF construction to reconcile various surveys might
adversely amplify the influence of serendipitous discoveries. Therefore, TDFs
selected from ongoing and upcoming uniform surveys like ZTF, Vera Rubin
Observatory (VRO) and Wide-Field Survey Telescope (WFST) should yield more
accurate LFs.

Cooper pairs would become insulating since the phase fluctuations would destroy
the coherent Josephson coupling. Although this prediction has been confirmed in
charge transport experiments, recent microwave measurements have questioned
this interpretation. Here, we insert a small junction in a Johnson-Nyquist type
setup, where it is driven by weak current noise arising from thermal
fluctuations. Our heat probe minimally perturbs the junction's equilibrium,
shedding light on features not visible in charge transport. We find that while
charge transport through the junction is dissipative as expected, thermal
transport is determined by the inductive-like Josephson response, unambiguously
demonstrating that a supercurrent survives even deep into the expected
insulating regime. The discrepancy between these two measurements highlights
the difference between the low frequency and the high frequency response of a
junction and calls for further theoretical and experimental inputs on the
dynamics of Josephson junctions in a highly dissipative environment.

adversarial robustness challenge from the view of disentangled representation
learning, which is able to explicitly disentangle robust and non-robust
features in text. Specifically, inspired by the variation of information (VI)
in information theory, we derive a disentangled learning objective composed of
mutual information to represent both the semantic representativeness of latent
embeddings and differentiation of robust and non-robust features. On the basis
of this, we design a disentangled learning network to estimate these mutual

our method significantly outperforms the representative methods under

several orders of magnitude from seed black holes formed at early times.
Detecting a population of intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) can provide
constraints on these elusive BH seeds. Here we use the large volume,
cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Astrid, which includes IMBH seeds and
dynamical friction to investigate the population of IMBH seeds. Dynamical
friction is largely inefficient at sinking and merging seed IMBHs at high-z.
This leads to an extensive population (several hundred per galaxy) of wandering
IMBHs in large halos at z~2. A small fraction of these IMBHs are detectable as
HLXs, Hyper Luminous X-ray sources. Importantly, at z ~ 2, IMBHs mergers
produce the peak of GW events. We find close to a million GW events in Astrid
between z=2-3 involving seed IMBH mergers. These GW events (almost all
detectable by LISA) at cosmic noon should provide strong constraints on IMBH
seed models and their formation mechanisms. At the center of massive galaxies,
where the number of IMBHs can be as high as 10-100, SMBH-IMBH pairs can form.
These Intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) and extreme mass ratio
inspirals (EMRIs), will require the next generation of milli-muHz space-based

transportation researchers, planners, and practitioners have started
acknowledging the need to build a diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible

survey-based approaches that are time-consuming and expensive. While there is
recent attention on leveraging social media data in transportation, the
literature is inconclusive regarding the use of social media data as a viable
alternative to traditional sources to identify the latent DEIA indicators based
on public reactions and perspectives on social media. This study utilized
large-scale Twitter data covering eight counties around the New York City (NYC)
area during the initial phase of the Covid-19 lockdown to address this research
gap. Natural language processing techniques were used to identify
transportation-related major DEIA issues for residents living around NYC by
analyzing their relevant tweet conversations. The study revealed that citizens,
who had negative sentiments toward the DEIA of their local transportation
system, broadly discussed racism, income, unemployment, gender, ride
dependency, transportation modes, and dependent groups. Analyzing the
socio-demographic information based on census tracts, the study also observed
that areas with a higher percentage of low-income, female, Hispanic, and Latino

description of a stream in the action-angle-frequency formalism still holds for
a realistic dwarf galaxy stream in a cosmological potential. Utilizing the
slopes of the line in angle and frequency space, we show that the correct

  Racing",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Autonomous drones can operate in remote and unstructured environments,
enabling various real-world applications. However, the lack of effective
vision-based algorithms has been a stumbling block to achieving this goal.
Existing systems often require hand-engineered components for state estimation,
planning, and control. Such a sequential design involves laborious tuning,
human heuristics, and compounding delays and errors. This paper tackles the
vision-based autonomous-drone-racing problem by learning deep sensorimotor
policies. We use contrastive learning to extract robust feature representations
from the input images and leverage a two-stage learning-by-cheating framework
for training a neural network policy. The resulting policy directly infers
control commands with feature representations learned from raw images, forgoing
the need for globally-consistent state estimation, trajectory planning, and
handcrafted control design. Our experimental results indicate that our
vision-based policy can achieve the same level of racing performance as the
state-based policy while being robust against different visual disturbances and
distractors. We believe this work serves as a stepping-stone toward developing
intelligent vision-based autonomous systems that control the drone purely from
image inputs, like human pilots.

To investigate whether LLMs have the ability to make this type of inference,

for joint and nonparametric modeling of multivariate count, continuous,
ordinal, and unordered categorical variables, and deploy this model for

introduce a new and computationally efficient strategy for marginal

demonstrate exceptional modeling and imputation capabilities relative to

``ultra-puffy'' galaxies (UPGs), defined to be $1.5\sigma$ above the average
mass-size relation, represent the tail of the satellite size distribution. We
find that each MW analog hosts $N_{\rm UPG} = 0.31\pm 0.05$ ultra-puffy

observed abundance at this halo mass in the Local Volume. We also construct a
sample of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in MW analogs and find an abundance of
$N_{\rm UDG} = 0.44\pm0.05$ per host. With literature results, we confirm that
the UDG abundance scales with the host halo mass following a sublinear power

paper, we discover further details of this duality by analyzing a simple

sum over superselection sectors associated to different irreducible

scientific discoveries. However, the ultrahigh dimensionality and
non-negligible measurement errors in the data may create difficulties in
estimation. There are limited methods for high-dimensional covariates with
measurement error, that usually require knowledge of the noise distribution and
focus on linear or generalized linear models. In this work, we develop
high-dimensional measurement error models for a class of Lipschitz loss
functions that encompasses logistic regression, hinge loss and quantile
regression, among others. Our estimator is designed to minimize the $L_1$ norm
among all estimators belonging to suitable feasible sets, without requiring any
knowledge of the noise distribution. Subsequently, we generalize these
estimators to a Lasso analog version that is computationally scalable to higher
dimensions. We derive theoretical guarantees in terms of finite sample
statistical error bounds and sign consistency, even when the dimensionality
increases exponentially with the sample size. Extensive simulation studies
demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in classification
and quantile regression problems. An application to a gender classification
task based on brain functional connectivity in the Human Connectome Project
data illustrates improved accuracy under our approach, and the ability to
reliably identify significant brain connections that drive gender differences.

surge of information, human risk perceptions are exposed to the influences from
both beneficial knowledge and fake news. In this paper, we study the role of
the risk perceptions of the insurer and the user in cyber insurance contracts.
We formulate the cyber insurance problem into a principal-agent problem where
the insurer designs the contract containing a premium payment and a coverage
plan. The risk perceptions of the insurer and the user are captured by coherent
risk measures. Our framework extends the cyber insurance problem containing a
risk-neutral insurer and a possibly risk-averse user, which is often considered
in the literature. The explicit characterizations of both the insurer's and the
user's risk perceptions allow us to show that cyber insurance has the potential
to incentivize the user to invest more on system protection. This possibility
to increase cyber security relies on the facts that the insurer is more
risk-averse than the user (in a minimization setting) and that the insurer's
risk perception is more sensitive to the changes in the user's actions than the
user himself. We investigate the properties of feasible contracts in a case

contained in the thick disk but with an unknown origin. Nyx could be the
remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy, in which case the associated dark matter
substructure could affect terrestrial dark matter direct detection experiments.
Alternatively, Nyx could be a signature of the Milky Way's disk formation and
evolution. To determine the origin of Nyx, we obtained high-resolution
spectroscopy of 34 Nyx stars using Keck/HIRES and Magellan/MIKE. A differential
chemical abundance analysis shows that most Nyx stars reside in a metal-rich
($\mbox{[Fe/H]} > -1$) high-$\alpha$ component that is chemically
indistinguishable from the thick disk. This rules out an originally suggested
scenario that Nyx is the remnant of a single massive dwarf galaxy merger.
However, we also identify five substantially more metal-poor stars
($\mbox{[Fe/H]} \sim -2.0$) that have chemical abundances similar to the
metal-weak thick disk. It remains unclear how stars chemically identical to the
thick disk can be on such prograde, high-eccentricity orbits. We suggest two
most likely scenarios: that Nyx is the result of an early minor dwarf galaxy
merger or that it is a record of the early spin-up of the Milky Way disk --
although neither perfectly reproduces the chemodynamic observations. The most
likely formation scenarios suggest that future spectroscopic surveys should
find Nyx-like structures outside of the Solar Neighborhood.

predict different time evolution for the disc radii. In this Letter, we present
an analytical solution for the evolution of the disc radii in viscously
evolving protoplanetary discs using $^{12}$CO as a tracer, under the assumption
that the $^{12}$CO radius is the radius where the surface density of the disc
is equal to the threshold for CO photo-dissociation. We discuss the properties
of the solution and the limits of its applicability as a simple numerical
prescription to evaluate the observed disc radii of populations of discs. Our
results suggest that, in addition to photo-dissociation, also freeze out plays
an important role in setting the disc size. We find an effective reduction of
the CO abundance by about two orders of magnitude at the location of CO
photo-dissociation, which however should not be interpreted as the bulk
abundance of CO in the disc. The use of our analytical solution will allow to
compute disc sizes for large quantities of models without using expensive

e-commerce, but involve challenging vision-and-language learning problems -
e.g., retrieving a fashion item given a reference image plus text feedback from
a user. Prior works on multimodal fashion tasks have either been limited by the
data in individual benchmarks, or have leveraged generic vision-and-language
pre-training but have not taken advantage of the characteristics of fashion
data. Additionally, these works have mainly been restricted to multimodal
understanding tasks. To address these gaps, we make two key contributions.
First, we propose a novel fashion-specific pre-training framework based on
weakly-supervised triplets constructed from fashion image-text pairs. We show
the triplet-based tasks are an effective addition to standard multimodal
pre-training tasks. Second, we propose a flexible decoder-based model
architecture capable of both fashion retrieval and captioning tasks. Together,
our model design and pre-training approach are competitive on a diverse set of
fashion tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, image retrieval with text
feedback, image captioning, relative image captioning, and multimodal
categorization.

time sensitive manner is critical in many industries, eg. bank fraud,
enterprise systems, medical alerts, etc. Large-scale systems often grow in size
and complexity over time, and anomaly detection algorithms need to adapt to
changing structures. A hierarchical approach takes advantage of the implicit
relationships in complex systems and localized context. The features in complex
systems may vary drastically in data distribution, capturing different aspects
from multiple data sources, and when put together provide a more complete view
of the system. In this paper, two datasets are considered, the 1st comprising
of system metrics from machines running on a cloud service, and the 2nd of
application metrics from a large-scale distributed software system with
inherent hierarchies and interconnections amongst its system nodes. Comparing
algorithms, across the changepoint based PELT algorithm, cognitive
learning-based Hierarchical Temporal Memory algorithms, Support Vector Machines
and Conditional Random Fields provides a basis for proposing a Hierarchical
Global-Local Conditional Random Field approach to accurately capture anomalies
in complex systems across various features. Hierarchical algorithms can learn
both the intricacies of specific features, and utilize these in a global
abstracted representation to detect anomalous patterns robustly across
multi-source feature data and distributed systems. A graphical network analysis
on complex systems can further fine-tune datasets to mine relationships based
on available features, which can benefit hierarchical models. Furthermore,
hierarchical solutions can adapt well to changes at a localized level, learning
on new data and changing environments when parts of a system are over-hauled,
and translate these learnings to a global view of the system over time.

dynamics by which neural networks learn and forget examples throughout
training. Popular metrics derived from these dynamics include (i) the epoch at
which examples are first correctly classified; (ii) the number of times their
predictions flip during training; and (iii) whether their prediction flips if
they are held out. However, these metrics do not distinguish among examples
that are hard for distinct reasons, such as membership in a rare subpopulation,
being mislabeled, or belonging to a complex subpopulation. In this paper, we
propose $second$-$split$ $forgetting$ $time$ (SSFT), a complementary metric
that tracks the epoch (if any) after which an original training example is
forgotten as the network is fine-tuned on a randomly held out partition of the
data. Across multiple benchmark datasets and modalities, we demonstrate that
$mislabeled$ examples are forgotten quickly, and seemingly $rare$ examples are
forgotten comparatively slowly. By contrast, metrics only considering the first
split learning dynamics struggle to differentiate the two. At large learning
rates, SSFT tends to be robust across architectures, optimizers, and random
seeds. From a practical standpoint, the SSFT can (i) help to identify
mislabeled samples, the removal of which improves generalization; and (ii)
provide insights about failure modes. Through theoretical analysis addressing
overparameterized linear models, we provide insights into how the observed

profile of the solar wind proton temperature. This phenomenon has been studied
for several decades. The dissipation of turbulence energy has been proposed as
the main physical process responsible for the temperature profile. The
turbulence is both convected with the solar wind and originated in the solar
wind by the compressions and shears in the flows and by pick-up ions. The
compression source of the solar wind heating in the outer heliosphere appears
due to shock waves, which originated either in the solar corona or in the solar
wind itself. The goal of this work is to demonstrate that the shock-wave
heating itself is enough to explain the temperature profile obtained by
Voyager-2. The effect of shock-wave heating is demonstrated in the frame of a
very simple spherically symmetric high-resolution (in both space and time)
gas-dynamical data-driven solar wind model. This data-driven model employs the
solar-wind parameters at 1 AU with minute resolution. The data are taken from
the NASA OMNIWeb database. It is important to underline that (1) the model
captures the shocks traveling and/or originating in the solar wind, and (2)
other sources of heating are not taken into account in the model. We extended
this simple model to the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and two-component models and
found very similar results. The results of the numerical modeling with the
one-minute OMNI data as the boundary condition show very good agreement with
the solar-wind temperature profiles obtained by Voyager-2. It is also
noteworthy that the numerical results with daily averaged OMNI data show a very
similar temperature profile, while the numerical runs with 27-day-averaged OMNI
data demonstrate the adiabatic behavior of the temperature.

found that the interferometer constrictions host the localized states that

malfunctioning. In this work, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied to
examine the mechanical properties of the silicone elastomer
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) a common substrate in cell culture. Force
spectroscopy analysis was done over different specimens of this elastomeric
material containing varying ratios of resin to cross-linker in its structure
(5:1, 10:1, 20:1, 30:1 and 50:1), which impacts the final material properties
(e.g., stiffness, elasticity). To quantify the mechanical properties of the
PDMS, factors as the modulus of Young, the maximum adhesive forces as well as
both relaxation amplitudes and times upon constant height contact of the tip
(dwell time different of zero) were calculated from the different segments
forming the force curves. It is demonstrated that the material stiffness is
increased by prior oxygen plasma treatment of the sample, required for
hydrophilic switching, contrarily to what observed for its adhesiveness.
Subsequent incubation of endothelial HUVEC cells on top of these plasma treated
PDMS systems yields minor variation in cell mechanics in comparison to those
obtained on a glass reference, on which cells show much higher spreading
tendency and, by extension, a remarkable membrane hardening. Thus, surface
wettability turns a factor of higher relevance than substrate stiffness

of a recent conjecture on the optimal patrolling strategy for trees. The
conjecture asserts that a particular patrolling strategy called the
E-patrolling strategy is optimal for all tree networks. The conjecture was
previously known to be true in a limited class of special cases. The
E-patrolling strategy has the advantage of being straightforward to calculate
and implement. We prove the conjecture by presenting $\varepsilon$-optimal
strategies for the Attacker which provide upper bounds for the value of the
game that come arbitrarily close to the lower bound provided by the
E-patrolling strategy. We also solve the patrolling game in some cases for
complete networks.

  combustion wave propagation",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In the present work, the discrete flame model [1] is augmented by introducing
the thermal inertia of particles in the preheating zone. The effect of particle
thermal inertia on flame speed, propagation limits, and near-limits dynamics of
one-dimensional discrete combustion waves is studied using the new model. It is
found that, with the increase of particle thermal inertia, the propagation
velocity of the discrete flame decreases due to a smaller heating rate of the
particles. Besides, particle thermal inertia extends the propagation limits
compared to the prediction of the old model. Furthermore, it is mathematically
proven that the nonphysical branch of the solutions for the discrete flame
speeds, found using the old discrete model, is a set of solutions for the
propagation limits of steady-state discrete flames with particle thermal
inertia included. The flame speed predicted using the new model is also
compared with that determined analytically using a continuum model considering
the thermal inertia of the condensed phase [2]. We find that the discrete flame
speeds predicted by the both models become closer to each other with increasing
particle thermal inertia. Finally, the two models converge regardless of the
discrete nature of the heat sources when particle thermal inertia is large
enough so that can limit the flame propagation. The particle thermal inertia
controlled flames could be regarded as a new kind of combustion regime.

field due to its importance in solving real-world problems across different
domains, such as energy, weather, traffic, and economy. As shown in various
types of data, it has been a must-see issue to deal with drastic changes,
temporal patterns, and shapes in sequential data that previous models are weak
in prediction. This is because most cases in time-series forecasting aim to
minimize $L_p$ norm distances as loss functions, such as mean absolute error
(MAE) or mean square error (MSE). These loss functions are vulnerable to not
only considering temporal dynamics modeling but also capturing the shape of
signals. In addition, these functions often make models misbehave and return
uncorrelated results to the original time-series. To become an effective loss
function, it has to be invariant to the set of distortions between two
time-series data instead of just comparing exact values. In this paper, we
propose a novel loss function, called TILDE-Q (Transformation Invariant Loss
function with Distance EQuilibrium), that not only considers the distortions in
amplitude and phase but also allows models to capture the shape of time-series
sequences. In addition, TILDE-Q supports modeling periodic and non-periodic
temporal dynamics at the same time. We evaluate the effectiveness of TILDE-Q by
conducting extensive experiments with respect to periodic and non-periodic
conditions of data, from naive models to state-of-the-art models. The
experiment results indicate that the models trained with TILDE-Q outperform
those trained with other training metrics (e.g., MSE, dynamic time warping

predictive tasks. ML models, however, are increasingly more complex, resource
intensive, and costlier to deploy in resource-constrained environments. These
issues are exacerbated for prediction tasks with sequential classification on
progressively transitioned stages with ''happens-before'' relation between
them.We argue that it is possible to ''unfold'' a monolithic single multi-class
classifier, typically trained for all stages using all data, into a series of
single-stage classifiers. Each single-stage classifier can be cascaded
gradually from cheaper to more expensive binary classifiers that are trained
using only the necessary data modalities or features required for that stage.
UnfoldML is a cost-aware and uncertainty-based dynamic 2D prediction pipeline
for multi-stage classification that enables (1) navigation of the accuracy/cost
tradeoff space, (2) reducing the spatio-temporal cost of inference by orders of
magnitude, and (3) early prediction on proceeding stages. UnfoldML achieves
orders of magnitude better cost in clinical settings, while detecting
multi-stage disease development in real time. It achieves within 0.1% accuracy
from the highest-performing multi-class baseline, while saving close to 20X on
spatio-temporal cost of inference and earlier (3.5hrs) disease onset
prediction. We also show that UnfoldML generalizes to image classification,
where it can predict different level of labels (from coarse to fine) given
different level of abstractions of a image, saving close to 5X cost with as
little as 0.4% accuracy reduction.

  Reweighting","AAAI-23",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Among many
defense strategies, adversarial training with untargeted attacks is one of the
most effective methods. Theoretically, adversarial perturbation in untargeted
attacks can be added along arbitrary directions and the predicted labels of
untargeted attacks should be unpredictable. However, we find that the naturally
imbalanced inter-class semantic similarity makes those hard-class pairs become
virtual targets of each other. This study investigates the impact of such
closely-coupled classes on adversarial attacks and develops a self-paced
reweighting strategy in adversarial training accordingly. Specifically, we
propose to upweight hard-class pair losses in model optimization, which prompts
learning discriminative features from hard classes. We further incorporate a
term to quantify hard-class pair consistency in adversarial training, which
greatly boosts model robustness. Extensive experiments show that the proposed
adversarial training method achieves superior robustness performance over
state-of-the-art defenses against a wide range of adversarial attacks.

When participants ranked the caption behaviors, there was almost an equal

Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs), is a promising prospect for

because they do not need manual feature design and can learn high-level

by learning network architecture and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
However, applying NAS to QCNNs presents unique challenges due to the lack of a
well-defined search space. In this work, we propose a novel framework for
representing QCNN architectures using techniques from NAS, which enables search

flux rope formation and evolution could happen. In this work, we perform
extrapolation in active region (AR) 12158, based on an recently developed
magnetohydrostatic (MHS) method which takes plasma forces into account. By
comparing the results with those from the force-free field extrapolation
methods, we find that the overall properties, which are characterized by the
magnetic free energy and helicity, are roughly the same. The major differences
lie in the magnetic configuration and the twist number of magnetic flux rope
(MFR). Unlike previous works either obtained sheared arcades or one coherent
flux rope, the MHS method derives two sets of MFR, which are highly twisted and
slightly coupled. Specifically, the result in the present work is more
comparable with the high-resolution observations from the chromosphere, through
the transition region to the corona, such as the filament fibrils, pre-eruptive

for the case of symmetric label noise: We find that certain DNNs, including
under-parameterized and over-parameterized models, can tolerate massive
symmetric label noise up to the information-theoretic threshold. By appealing
to classical statistical theory and universal consistency of DNNs, we prove
that for multiclass classification, $L_1$-consistent DNN classifiers trained

label noise probability is less than $\frac{K-1}{K}$, where $K \ge 2$ is the

highly localised structures around the island's long axis, contrary to the

pickup head translation, and three lasers in a compact and portable format.
Here we integrate a blood-coated image sensor with a modified Blu-ray drive for
high-throughput cytometric analysis of various bio-specimens. In this device,
samples are mounted on the rotating Blu-ray disc and illuminated by the
built-in lasers from the pickup head. The resulting coherent diffraction
patterns are then recorded by the blood-coated image sensor. The rich spatial
features of the blood-cell monolayer help down-modulate the object information
for sensor detection, thus forming a high-resolution computational bio-lens
with a theoretically unlimited field of view. With the acquired data, we
develop a lensless coherent diffraction imaging modality termed rotational
ptychography for image reconstruction. We show that our device can resolve the
435 nm linewidth on the resolution target and has a field of view only limited
by the size of the Blu-ray disc. To demonstrate its applications, we perform
high-throughput urinalysis by locating disease-related calcium oxalate crystals
over the entire microscope slide. We also quantify different types of cells on
a blood smear with an acquisition speed of ~10,000 cells per second. For in
vitro experiment, we monitor live bacterial cultures over the entire Petri dish
with single-cell resolution. Using biological cells as a computational lens
could enable new intriguing imaging devices for point-of-care diagnostics.
Modifying a Blu-ray drive with the blood-coated sensor further allows the
spread of high-throughput optical microscopy from well-equipped laboratories to
citizen scientists worldwide.

historical context and predefined persona. Unlike conventional dialogue
generation, the persona-based dialogue needs to consider both dialogue context
and persona, posing a challenge for coherent training. Specifically, this
requires a delicate weight balance between context and persona. To achieve
that, in this paper, we propose an effective framework with Persona-Adaptive
Attention (PAA), which adaptively integrates the weights from the persona and
context information via our designed attention. In addition, a dynamic masking
mechanism is applied to the PAA to not only drop redundant information in
context and persona but also serve as a regularization mechanism to avoid
overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
PAA framework compared to the strong baselines in both automatic and human
evaluation. Moreover, the proposed PAA approach can perform equivalently well
in a low-resource regime compared to models trained in a full-data setting,
which achieve a similar result with only 20% to 30% of data compared to the
larger models trained in the full-data setting. To fully exploit the
effectiveness of our design, we designed several variants for handling the
weighted information in different ways, showing the necessity and sufficiency
of our weighting and masking designs.

octahedral (BX$_{6}$) environments with the former forming a diamond lattice
and the latter a geometrically frustrated pyrochlore lattice. Exploring the
fascinating properties and their correlations with structural features is
critical in understanding these materials. FeMn$_{2}$O$_{4}$ has been reported
to exhibit one structural transition and two successive magnetic transitions.
Here, we report the polyhedral distortions and their correlations to the
structural and two magnetic transitions in FeMn$_{2}$O$_{4}$ by employing the
high-resolution neutron powder diffraction. While a large trigonal distortion
is found even in the high-temperature cubic phase, the first-order
cubic-tetragonal structural transition associated with the elongation of both
tetrahedra and octahedra along the $c$ axis occurs at $T_{S} \approx$ 750 K,
driven by the Jahn-Teller effect of the orbital active B-site Mn$^{3+}$ cation.
A strong magnetoelastic coupling is unveiled at $T_{N1}\approx 400$ K as
manifested by the appearance of N\`{e}el-type collinear ferrimagnetic order, an
anomaly in both tetrahedral and octahedral distortions, as well as an anomalous
decrease of the lattice constant $c$ and a weak anomaly of $a$. Upon cooling
below $T_{N2}\approx65$ K, it evolves to a noncollinear ferrimagnetic order
with a canting of half B-site $Mn^{3+}$/$Fe^{3+}$ spins in the pyrochlore
lattice, which is a unique magnetic order among spinels. Such a noncollinear
order induces modifications of the O-B-O bond angles in the octahedra without
affecting much the bond lengths of the tetrahedra/octahedra. Our study
indicates that FeMn$_{2}$O$_{4}$ is a wonderful platform to unveil interesting
magnetic order and to investigate their correlations to polyhedral distortions
and lattice.

representative observations, including the mass ratio between the globular
cluster system and its host galaxy, the globular cluster occupancy, the number
fraction of blue globular clusters, and the metallicity gradient with the
globular cluster mass. Because we can know the positions of globular clusters
with time, comparison with additional observations is possible, e.g., the
median radii of the globular cluster system in individual galaxies, the mean
projected density profiles of intracluster globular clusters, and metallicity
and age gradients of globular clusters with a clustercentric radius. We also
find that the specific mass of the globular cluster system in each galaxy is

Several deep-learning-based methods have been proposed in recent years.

should learn across datasets arriving sequentially from different hospitals by
building upon the characteristics of lesions in a continual manner. In this
regard, we explore experience replay, a well-known continual learning method,

different hospitals. Our experiments show that replay is able to achieve
positive backward transfer and reduce catastrophic forgetting compared to
sequential fine-tuning. Furthermore, replay outperforms the multi-domain

top-down control of attention, compared to free-viewing. In this paper, we
present two approaches to model visual attention and distraction of observers
during visual search. Our first approach adapts a light-weight free-viewing
saliency model to predict eye fixation density maps of human observers over
pixels of search images, using a two-stream convolutional encoder-decoder
network, trained and evaluated on COCO-Search18 dataset. This method predicts
which locations are more distracting when searching for a particular target.
Our network achieves good results on standard saliency metrics (AUC-Judd=0.95,

Our second approach is object-based and predicts the distractor and target
objects during visual search. Distractors are all objects except the target
that observers fixate on during search. This method uses a Mask-RCNN
segmentation network pre-trained on MS-COCO and fine-tuned on COCO-Search18

Polycrystalline CrPSe$_3$ was synthesized at an optimized temperature of
700$^\circ$C to avoid the formation of any secondary phases (e.g.,
Cr$_2$Se$_3$). The antiferromagnetic transition appeared at $T_N\sim 126$ K

susceptibility measurements, indicating weak frustration in CrPSe$_3$ with a
frustration factor $f (|T_{\rm CW}|/T_N) \sim 3$. Evidently, the formation of
long-range incommensurate spin-density wave antiferromagnetic order with the
propagation vector $k = (0, 0.04, 0)$ was revealed by neutron diffraction
measurements at low temperatures (below 120K). The monoclinic crystal structure

will undoubtedly be expected to behave in a manner that is preferred by the

To achieve this, the current approaches either require the users to specify the
reward function or the preference is interactively learned from queries that
ask the user to compare behavior. The former approach can be challenging if the
internal representation used by the agent is inscrutable to the human while the
latter is unnecessarily cumbersome for the user if their preference can be
specified more easily in symbolic terms. In this work, we propose PRESCA
(PREference Specification through Concept Acquisition), a system that allows
users to specify their preferences in terms of concepts that they understand.
PRESCA maintains a set of such concepts in a shared vocabulary. If the relevant
concept is not in the shared vocabulary, then it is learned. To make learning a
new concept more feedback efficient, PRESCA leverages causal associations
between the target concept and concepts that are already known. In addition, we
use a novel data augmentation approach to further reduce required feedback. We
evaluate PRESCA by using it on a Minecraft environment and show that it can
effectively align the agent with the user's preference.

elements in r-process-enhanced stars may also apply to Se, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo,

suggest that at least one relatively common source in the early Universe
produced a consistent abundance pattern among some elements spanning the first

inference at the wireless edge, thus enabling mission-critical applications.
Accordingly, base stations (BSs) and edge servers (ESs) need to be densely
deployed, leading to huge deployment and operation costs, in particular the
energy costs. In this article, we propose a new framework called
Mobility-Enhanced Edge inTelligence (MEET), which exploits the sensing,
communication, computing, and self-powering capabilities of intelligent
connected vehicles for the smart and green 6G networks. Specifically, the
operators can incorporate infrastructural vehicles as movable BSs or ESs, and
schedule them in a more flexible way to align with the communication and
computation traffic fluctuations. Meanwhile, the remaining compute resources of
opportunistic vehicles are exploited for edge training and inference, where
mobility can further enhance edge intelligence by bringing more compute
resources, communication opportunities, and diverse data. In this way, the
deployment and operation costs are spread over the vastly available vehicles,
so that the edge intelligence is realized cost-effectively and sustainably.
Furthermore, these vehicles can be either powered by renewable energy to reduce
carbon emissions, or charged more flexibly during off-peak hours to cut

a single atom that is physically isolated from the ensemble. With this control
technique, it is also possible to entangle an ensemble with a single atom
deterministically, which mimics the thought experiment known as the

generate a mesoscopic Schr\""odinger cat state for a large number of atoms far
more rapidly that the conventional process for generating such a state, with an
orientation that is independent of the parity of the number of atoms. Apart
from the echo configuration, we have also investigated the behavior of
one-axis-twist squeezing for some special values of the squeezing parameter. We
find that the squeezing propagator can be expressed as the sum of n rotation
operators if the product of n and the squeezing parameter equals pi, where n is
a non-zero integer. A direct consequence of this property of one-axis-twist

instabilities, the planar instability influences the subsequent stages
significantly, deserving in-depth investigations. In this paper, the planar

Firstly, the dynamical evolution of the planar instability is performed by the
theoretical model and phase-field model, respectively. Secondly, to represent
the history-dependence of solidification, the varying parameters are adopted in
the simulations. Then the criterion of the planar instability under the varying
conditions is discussed. This paper considers the critical parameters of the
planar instability are the excess free energy at the interface and

out, showing good consistency. Moreover, solidification processes with
different preferred crystallographic orientations are performed, demonstrating
the effect mechanism of the excess free energy and interfacial energy on the
planar instability. The idea of the interfacial energy influencing the planar
instability could be applied to investigating other patterns induced by

algorithms to develop interatomic potential models. Machine-learned potential
models are typically orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory
but also orders of magnitude slower than physics-derived models such as the
embedded atom method. In our previous work, we used symbolic regression to
develop fast, accurate and transferrable interatomic potential models for
copper with novel functional forms that resemble those of the embedded atom
method. To determine the extent to which the success of these forms was
specific to copper, here we explore the generalizability of these models to
other face-centered cubic transition metals and analyze their out-of-sample
performance on several material properties. We found that these forms work
particularly well on elements that are chemically similar to copper. When
compared to optimized Sutton-Chen models, which have similar complexity, the
functional forms discovered using symbolic regression perform better across all
elements considered except gold where they have a similar performance. They
perform similarly to a moderately more complex embedded atom form on properties
on which they were trained, and they are more accurate on average on other
properties. We attribute this improved generalized accuracy to the relative
simplicity of the models discovered using symbolic regression. The genetic
programming models are found to outperform other models from the literature
about 50% of the time in a variety of property predictions, with about 1/10th
the model complexity on average. We discuss the implications of these results
to the broader application of symbolic regression to the development of new
potentials and highlight how models discovered for one element can be used to
seed new searches for different elements.

users' latency via offering storage capacities at the edge of the network. The
efficiency of the MEC network, however, critically depends on its ability to
dynamically predict/update the storage of caching nodes with the top-K popular
contents. Conventional statistical caching schemes are not robust to the
time-variant nature of the underlying pattern of content requests, resulting in
a surge of interest in using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for time-series
popularity prediction in MEC networks. However, existing DNN models within the
context of MEC fail to simultaneously capture both temporal correlations of
historical request patterns and the dependencies between multiple contents.
This necessitates an urgent quest to develop and design a new and innovative
popularity prediction architecture to tackle this critical challenge. The paper
addresses this gap by proposing a novel hybrid caching framework based on the
attention mechanism. Referred to as the parallel Vision Transformers with Cross
Attention (ViT-CAT) Fusion, the proposed architecture consists of two parallel
ViT networks, one for collecting temporal correlation, and the other for
capturing dependencies between different contents. Followed by a Cross
Attention (CA) module as the Fusion Center (FC), the proposed ViT-CAT is
capable of learning the mutual information between temporal and spatial
correlations, as well, resulting in improving the classification accuracy, and
decreasing the model's complexity about 8 times. Based on the simulation
results, the proposed ViT-CAT architecture outperforms its counterparts across
the classification accuracy, complexity, and cache-hit ratio.

of SWheg, a novel modular wheel-leg transformable robot family with minimalist
actuator realization. SWheg takes advantage of both wheeled and legged
locomotion by seamlessly integrating them on a single platform. In contrast to
other designs that use multiple actuators, SWheg uses only one actuator to
drive the transformation of all the wheel-leg modules in sync. This means an
N-legged SWheg robot requires only N+1 actuators, which can significantly
reduce the cost and malfunction rate of the platform. The tendon-driven
wheel-leg transformation mechanism based on a four-bar linkage can perform fast
morphology transitions between wheels and legs. We validated the design
principle with two SWheg robots with four and six wheel-leg modules separately,
namely Quadrupedal SWheg and Hexapod SWheg. The design process, mechatronics
infrastructure, and the gait behavioral development of both platforms were
discussed. The performance of the robot was evaluated in various scenarios,
including driving and turning in wheeled mode, step crossing, irregular terrain
passing, and stair climbing in legged mode. The comparison between these two
platforms was also discussed.

capturing the prior distribution of all natural motions, which serve as the
basis for subsequent video-based motion capture tasks. To improve the
generalization capacity of prior space, we propose a transformer-based

separate video encoder is attached to the pretrained motion generator for
end-to-end fine-tuning over task-specific video datasets. Compared to existing

cross-modal 3D shape retrieval because of the natural differences between
modalities. In this paper, we propose an innovative concept, namely, geometric
words, which is regarded as the basic element to represent any 3D or 2D entity
by combination, and assisted by which, we can simultaneously handle
cross-domain or cross-modal retrieval problems. First, to construct the
knowledge graph, we utilize the geometric word as the node, and then use the
category of the 3D shape as well as the attribute of the geometry to bridge the
nodes. Second, based on the knowledge graph, we provide a unique way for
learning each entity's embedding. Finally, we propose an effective similarity
measure to handle the cross-domain and cross-modal 3D shape retrieval.
Specifically, every 3D or 2D entity could locate its geometric terms in the 3D
knowledge graph, which serve as a link between cross-domain and cross-modal
data. Thus, our approach can achieve the cross-domain and cross-modal 3D shape
retrieval at the same time. We evaluated our proposed method on the ModelNet40

sensors can give smooth pose estimation without drifting. The fusion system
gradually degrades to Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) with the number of
satellites decreasing, which guarantees robust global navigation in GNSS
unfriendly environments. In this letter, we propose an open-sourced invariant
filter-based platform, InGVIO, to tightly fuse monocular/stereo visual-inertial
measurements, along with raw data from GNSS. InGVIO gives highly competitive
results in terms of computational load compared to current graph-based
algorithms, meanwhile possessing the same or even better level of accuracy.
Thanks to our proposed marginalization strategies, the baseline for
triangulation is large although only a few cloned poses are kept. Moreover, we
define the infinitesimal symmetries of the system and exploit the various
structures of its symmetry group, being different from the total symmetries of
the VIO case, which elegantly gives results for the pattern of degenerate
motions and the structure of unobservable subspaces. We prove that the
properly-chosen invariant error is still compatible with all possible symmetry
group structures of InGVIO and has intrinsic consistency properties. Besides,
InGVIO has strictly linear error propagation without linearization error.
InGVIO is tested on both open datasets and our proposed fixed-wing datasets
with variable levels of difficulty and various numbers of satellites. The
latter datasets, to the best of our knowledge, are the first datasets
open-sourced to the community on a fixed-wing aircraft with raw GNSS.

pre-historic times. Sketch research has flourished in the past decade,
particularly with the proliferation of touchscreen devices. Much of the
utilisation of sketch has been anchored around the fact that it can be used to
delineate visual concepts universally irrespective of age, race, language, or
demography. The fine-grained interactive nature of sketches facilitates the
application of sketches to various visual understanding tasks, like image
retrieval, image-generation or editing, segmentation, 3D-shape modelling etc.
However, sketches are highly abstract and subjective based on the perception of
individuals. Although most agree that sketches provide fine-grained control to
the user to depict a visual object, many consider sketching a tedious process
due to their limited sketching skills compared to other query/support
modalities like text/tags. Furthermore, collecting fine-grained sketch-photo
association is a significant bottleneck to commercialising sketch applications.
Therefore, this thesis aims to progress sketch-based visual understanding
towards more practicality.

shortcomings: On the one hand, text classification is deeply domain-dependent.
That is, a classifier trained on the corpus of one domain may not perform so
well in another domain. On the other hand, text classification models require a
lot of annotated data for training. However, for some domains, there may not
exist enough annotated data. Therefore, it is valuable to investigate how to
efficiently utilize text data from different domains to improve the performance
of models in various domains. Some multi-domain text classification models are
trained by adversarial training to extract shared features among all domains
and the specific features of each domain. We noted that the distinctness of the
domain-specific features is different, so in this paper, we propose to use a
curriculum learning strategy based on keyword weight ranking to improve the
performance of multi-domain text classification models. The experimental

of a network are most important, there remains a lack of centrality measures
that are related to the complexity of information flows and are derived
directly from entropy measures. Here, we introduce a ranking of edges based on
how each edge's removal would change a system's von Neumann entropy (VNE),
which is a spectral-entropy measure that has been adapted from quantum
information theory to quantify the complexity of information dynamics over
networks. We show that a direct calculation of such rankings is computationally
inefficient (or unfeasible) for large networks: e.g.\ the scaling is
$\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ per edge for networks with $N$ nodes. To overcome this
limitation, we employ spectral perturbation theory to estimate VNE
perturbations and derive an approximate edge-ranking algorithm that is accurate
and fast to compute, scaling as $\mathcal{O}(N)$ per edge. Focusing on a form
of VNE that is associated with a transport operator $e^{-\beta{ L}}$, where ${
L}$ is a graph Laplacian matrix and $\beta>0$ is a diffusion timescale
parameter, we apply this approach to diverse applications including a network
encoding polarized voting patterns of the 117th U.S. Senate, a multimodal
transportation system including roads and metro lines in London, and a
multiplex brain network encoding correlated human brain activity. Our
experiments highlight situations where the edges that are considered to be most
important for information diffusion complexity can dramatically change as one
considers short, intermediate and long timescales $\beta$ for diffusion.

international datasets: LIDC-IDRI, NSCLC-Lung1, RIDER, VESSEL12, RICORD-1A,
RICORD-1B, COVID-19-Italy, and COVID-19-China. AI segmentation achieved a mean

behavior fields and query fields. Pruning on these field pairs via these
learnable weights lead to automatic field pair selection, so as to identify and

Inspired by the way human eyes detect objects of interest, a new unified
dual-branch decoder paradigm named the difference-aware decoder is proposed in
this paper to explore the difference between the foreground and the background
and separate the objects of interest in optical images. The difference-aware
decoder imitates the human eye in three stages using the multi-level features
output by the encoder. In Stage A, the first branch decoder of the
difference-aware decoder is used to obtain a guide map. The highest-level
features are enhanced with a novel field expansion module and a dual residual
attention module, and are combined with the lowest-level features to obtain the
guide map. In Stage B, the other branch decoder adopts a middle feature fusion
module to make trade-offs between textural details and semantic information and
generate background-aware features. In Stage C, the proposed difference-aware
extractor, consisting of a difference guidance model and a difference
enhancement module, fuses the guide map from Stage A and the background-aware
features from Stage B, to enlarge the differences between the foreground and
the background and output a final detection result. The results demonstrate
that the difference-aware decoder can achieve a higher accuracy than the other
state-of-the-art binary segmentation methods for these tasks.

propose a method named O2NMatcher to generate Source Function Sets (SFSs) as

respectively. The TESS data allowed the detection of multiple periodicities, 12
for PG 1541$+$651, and six for BPM 31594, which enables us to perform a
detailed asteroseismological study. For both objects we found a representative
asteroseismic model with canonical stellar mass ~ 0.61 Msun and thick hydrogen
envelopes, thicker than 10^(-5.3) M_*. The detection of triplets in the Fourier
transform also allowed us to estimate mean rotation periods, being ~22 h for PG
1541+651 and 11.6 h for BPM 31594, which is consistent with range of values
reported for other ZZ Ceti stars.

expensive and requires different algorithms and manually tunes model parameter.
The deep learning methods based on the U-Net structure have obtained
outstanding performances in many different medical image segmentation tasks,
but designing such networks requires a lot of parameters and training data, not
always available for practical problems. In this paper, inspired by traditional
multi-phase convexity Mumford-Shah variational model and full approximation
scheme (FAS) solving the nonlinear systems, we propose a novel
variational-model-informed network (denoted as FAS-Unet) that exploits the
model and algorithm priors to extract the multi-scale features. The proposed
model-informed network integrates image data and mathematical models, and
implements them through learning a few convolution kernels. Based on the
variational theory and FAS algorithm, we first design a feature extraction
sub-network (FAS-Solution module) to solve the model-driven nonlinear systems,
where a skip-connection is employed to fuse the multi-scale features. Secondly,
we further design a convolution block to fuse the extracted features from the
previous stage, resulting in the final segmentation possibility. Experimental
results on three different medical image segmentation tasks show that the
proposed FAS-Unet is very competitive with other state-of-the-art methods in
qualitative, quantitative and model complexity evaluations. Moreover, it may
also be possible to train specialized network architectures that automatically
satisfy some of the mathematical and physical laws in other image problems for
better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization.The code is

photoinjected into $\textrm{Cs}_{3}\textrm{Bi}_{2}\textrm{I}_{9}$ form
self-trapped excitons on an ultrafast time scale. However, they retain most of
their energy and their coupling to Fr\""ohlich-type optical phonons is limited
at early times. Instead, the long-lived excitons exert an electronic stress via
deformation potential and develop a prominent, sustaining strain field as
coherent acoustic phonons in 10 ps. From sub-ps to ns and beyond, a similar
extent of the atomic displacements is found throughout the different stages of
structural distortions, from limited local modulations to a coherent strain
field to the Debye-Waller random atomic motions on longer times. The current
results suggest the potential use of bismuth-based perovskites for applications
other than photovoltaics to take advantage of carriers' stronger self-trapping

notion, which we term loss aversion, capturing the fact that when comparing two
actions an agent should not care about payoffs in situations where they lead to
identical payoffs, removing trivial equivalencies. We study the properties of
loss aversion, its relations to other robust notions, and illustrate its use in

cognitive bias on the side of decision makers, the problem of economic design
is to maximize social welfare when facing self-motivated participants. In
online environments, such as the Web, participants' incentives take a novel
form originating from the lack of clear agent identity -- the ability to create
Sybil attacks, i.e., the ability of each participant to act using multiple
identities. It is well-known that Sybil attacks are a major obstacle for
welfare-maximization. Our major result proves that the celebrated VCG mechanism
is welfare maximizing when agents are loss-averse, even under Sybil attacks.

the distilled models due to their dependence on priors including the amount of

hyperparameters and confidence of the teacher models, makes distillation a
brittle compression mechanism. To mitigate this, we explore the use of

that while distillation provides gains across some low-resource languages,
quantization provides more consistent performance trends for the entire range
of languages, especially the lowest-resource languages in our target set.

(such as images), especially for complex environments and tasks, is a
challenging problem that hinders the broad application of MBRL in the real

learning system called SAM-RL. Leveraging the differentiable physics-based
simulation and rendering, SAM-RL automatically updates the model by comparing
rendered images with real raw images and produces the policy efficiently. With
the sensing-aware learning pipeline, SAM-RL allows a robot to select an
informative viewpoint to monitor the task process. We apply our framework to
real world experiments for accomplishing three manipulation tasks: robotic
assembly, tool manipulation, and deformable object manipulation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of SAM-RL via extensive experiments. Videos are available on

remember all the training samples and guide the generator to replicate them,
leading to severe diversity degradation. Several methods have been proposed to
relieve overfitting by adapting GANs pre-trained on large source domains to
target domains using limited real samples. This work presents a novel approach
to realize few-shot GAN adaptation via masked discrimination. Random masks are
applied to features extracted by the discriminator from input images. We aim to
encourage the discriminator to judge various images which share partially
common features with training samples as realistic. Correspondingly, the
generator is guided to generate diverse images instead of replicating training
samples. In addition, we employ a cross-domain consistency loss for the
discriminator to keep relative distances between generated samples in its
feature space. It strengthens global image discrimination and guides adapted
GANs to preserve more information learned from source domains for higher image
quality. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated both qualitatively

ducts, the particle focusing is a result of balance between two dominant forces
on the particle: (i) inertial lift arising from small inertia of the fluid, and
(ii) drag arising from cross-sectional vortices induced by the centrifugal
force on the fluid. Bifurcations of particle equilibria take place as the bend
radius of the curved duct varies. By using the mathematical model of Harding,
Stokes, and Bertozzi [1], we illustrate via numerical simulations that these
bifurcations can be leveraged in a spiral duct to achieve large separation
between different sized particles by transiently focusing smaller particles
near saddle-points. We demonstrate this by separating similar-sized particles,
as well as particles that have a large difference in size, using spiral ducts
with square cross-section. The formalism of using bifurcations to manipulate
particle focusing can be applied more broadly to different geometries in

embedding space is learned by means of contrastive learning. NPC samples from

and on its own structure, its angular momentum can varysubstantially, and even
the robot's structure can deform if there is a mechanical weakness. Under these

we propose a complete control scheme to work with heavy robots in torque
control. The full centroidal dynamics is used to generate walking gaits online,
link deflections are taken into account to estimate the robot posture and all
postural instructions are designed to avoid conflicting with each other,
improving balance. These choices reduce model and control errors, allowing our
centroidal stabilizer to compensate for the remaining residual errors. The
stabilizer and motion generator are designed together to ensure feasibility
under the assumption of bounded errors. We deploy this scheme to control the
locomotion of the humanoid robot Talos, whose hip links flex when walking. It
allows us to reach steps of 35~cm, for an average speed of 25~cm/sec, which is
among the best performances so far for torque-controlled electric robots.

  Industrial Insertion of Novel Connectors from Vision","10 pages. To be presented at ICRA 2023",,,,"cs.RO cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning-based methods in robotics hold the promise of generalization, but
what can be done if a learned policy does not generalize to a new situation? In
principle, if an agent can at least evaluate its own success (i.e., with a
reward classifier that generalizes well even when the policy does not), it
could actively practice the task and finetune the policy in this situation. We
study this problem in the setting of industrial insertion tasks, such as
inserting connectors in sockets and setting screws. Existing algorithms rely on
precise localization of the connector or socket and carefully managed physical
setups, such as assembly lines, to succeed at the task. But in unstructured
environments such as homes or even some industrial settings, robots cannot rely
on precise localization and may be tasked with previously unseen connectors.
Offline reinforcement learning on a variety of connector insertion tasks is a
potential solution, but what if the robot is tasked with inserting previously
unseen connector? In such a scenario, we will still need methods that can
robustly solve such tasks with online practice. One of the main observations we
make in this work is that, with a suitable representation learning and domain
generalization approach, it can be significantly easier for the reward function
to generalize to a new but structurally similar task (e.g., inserting a new
type of connector) than for the policy. This means that a learned reward
function can be used to facilitate the finetuning of the robot's policy in
situations where the policy fails to generalize in zero shot, but the reward
function generalizes successfully. We show that such an approach can be
instantiated in the real world, pretrained on 50 different connectors, and
successfully finetuned to new connectors via the learned reward function.

propose BERT-Flow-VAE (BFV), a Weakly-Supervised Multi-Label Text
Classification (WSMLTC) model that reduces the need for full supervision. This
new model (1) produces BERT sentence embeddings and calibrates them using a
flow model, (2) generates an initial topic-document matrix by averaging results
of a seeded sparse topic model and a textual entailment model which only
require surface name of topics and 4-6 seed words per topic, and (3) adopts a
VAE framework to reconstruct the embeddings under the guidance of the
topic-document matrix. Finally, (4) it uses the means produced by the encoder
model in the VAE architecture as predictions for MLTC. Experimental results on
6 multi-label datasets show that BFV can substantially outperform other
baseline WSMLTC models in key metrics and achieve approximately 84% performance
of a fully-supervised model.

optimized throughout a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. The

is repeated by reducing the quantity of text to be aligned or expanding the

starting timestamps, or temporal anchors, are produced uniquely based on the
confidence score of the last aligned utterance. This score is computed with the
paths of the CTC-alignment matrix. With this methodology, no human-revised text

ready for further ASR adaptation. The obtained results, on both the Spanish

for visual-language understanding. Although impressive results have been
achieved in generating high-quality images, text-image consistency is still a
major concern in existing GAN-based methods. Particularly, the most popular
metric $R$-precision may not accurately reflect the text-image consistency,
often resulting in very misleading semantics in the generated images. Albeit
its significance, how to design a better text-image consistency metric
surprisingly remains under-explored in the community. In this paper, we make a
further step forward to develop a novel CLIP-based metric termed as Semantic
Similarity Distance ($SSD$), which is both theoretically founded from a
distributional viewpoint and empirically verified on benchmark datasets.
Benefiting from the proposed metric, we further design the Parallel Deep Fusion
Generative Adversarial Networks (PDF-GAN) that aims at improving text-image
consistency by fusing semantic information at different granularities and
capturing accurate semantics. Equipped with two novel plug-and-play components:
Hard-Negative Sentence Constructor and Semantic Projection, the proposed
PDF-GAN can mitigate inconsistent semantics and bridge the text-image semantic
gap. A series of experiments show that, as opposed to current state-of-the-art
methods, our PDF-GAN can lead to significantly better text-image consistency

than always making black boxes transparent, these approaches are at risk of
\emph{painting the black boxes white}, thus failing to provide a level of
transparency that would increase the system's usability and comprehensibility;
or, even, at risk of generating new errors, in what we termed the
\emph{white-box paradox}. To address these usability-related issues, in this
work we focus on the cognitive dimension of users' perception of explanations
and XAI systems. To this aim, we designed and conducted a questionnaire-based
experiment by which we involved 44 cardiology residents and specialists in an
AI-supported ECG reading task. In doing so, we investigated different research
questions concerning the relationship between users' characteristics (e.g.
expertise) and their perception of AI and XAI systems, including their trust,
the perceived explanations' quality and their tendency to defer the decision
process to automation (i.e. technology dominance), as well as the mutual
relationships among these different dimensions. Our findings provide a

are systematically investigated based on the realistic Bonn nucleon-nucleon

the full Dirac space, the neutron star properties are investigated. The direct
URCA process in neutron star cooling will happen at density

perform node selection, and eliminate nodes not contributing to the filter

Examples of Riemannian data in robotics include stiffness (symmetric and
positive definite matrix (SPD)) and orientation (unit quaternion (UQ))
trajectories. For Riemannian data, unlike Euclidean ones, different dimensions
are interconnected by geometric constraints which have to be properly
considered during the learning process. Using distance preserving mappings, our
approach transfers the data between their original manifold and the tangent
space, realizing the removing and re-fulfilling of the geometric constraints.
This allows to extend existing frameworks to learn stable skills from
Riemannian data while guaranteeing the stability of the learning results. The
ability of RiemannianFlow to learn various data patterns and the stability of
the learned models are experimentally shown on a dataset of manifold motions.
Further, we analyze from different perspectives the robustness of the model
with different hyperparameter combinations. It turns out that the model's
stability is not affected by different hyperparameters, a proper combination of
the hyperparameters leads to a significant improvement (up to 27.6%) of the
model accuracy. Last, we show the effectiveness of RiemannianFlow in a real

challenges that yield from modeling human outcomes from ambulatory real-life
data. The proposed metric learning is based on a Siamese neural network (SNN)
that learns the relative difference between pairs of samples from a target user
and non-target users, thus being able to address the scarcity of labelled data
from the target. The SNN further minimizes the Wasserstein distance of the
learned embeddings between target and non-target users, thus mitigating the
distribution mismatch between the two. Finally, given the fact that the base
rate of focal behaviors is different per user, the proposed method approximates
the focal base rate based on labelled samples that lay closest to the target,
based on which further minimizes the Wasserstein distance. Our method is
exemplified for the purpose of hourly stress classification using real-life
multimodal data from 72 dating couples. Results in few-shot and one-shot
learning experiments indicate that proposed formulation benefits stress
classification and can help mitigate the aforementioned challenges.

  Infusion for Scientific NLI",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the advance of natural language inference (NLI), a rising demand for NLI
is to handle scientific texts. Existing methods depend on pre-trained models
(PTM) which lack domain-specific knowledge. To tackle this drawback, we
introduce a scientific knowledge graph to generalize PTM to scientific domain.
However, existing knowledge graph construction approaches suffer from some
drawbacks, i.e., expensive labeled data, failure to apply in other domains,
long inference time and difficulty extending to large corpora. Therefore, we
propose an unsupervised knowledge graph construction method to build a
scientific knowledge graph (SKG) without any labeled data. Moreover, to
alleviate noise effect from SKG and complement knowledge in sentences better,
we propose an event-centric knowledge infusion method to integrate external
knowledge into each event that is a fine-grained semantic unit in sentences.
Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
and the effectiveness and reliability of SKG.

according to a Poisson process and are processed in an FCFS manner. The
processing time of the customers' demand is the exponential distribution. The
production manufacturers produce the items on a make-to-order basis to meet
customer demands. The production is run until the inventory level becomes
sufficiently large. We assume that an item's production time follows
exponential distribution and the amount of time for the produced item to reach
the retail shop is negligible. Also, we assume that no new customer joins the
queue when there is a void inventory. This yields an explicit product-form
solution for the steady-state probability vector of the system. The optimal
policy that minimizes the discounted/average/pathwise average total cost per
production is derived using a Markov decision process approach. We find optimal
policy using value/policy iteration algorithms. Numerical examples are

counts has received less attention than their continuous counterparts in the
extreme value theory (EVT) literature. One approach to moving from continuous
to discrete extremes is to model threshold exceedances of integer random
variables by the discrete version of the generalized Pareto distribution.
Still, the optimal threshold selection that defines exceedances remains a
problematic issue. Moreover, within a regression framework, the treatment of
the many data points (those below the chosen threshold) is either ignored or
decoupled from extremes. Considering these issues, we extend the idea of using
a smooth transition between the two tails (lower and upper) to force large and
small discrete extreme values to comply with EVT. In the case of zero
inflation, we also develop models with an additional parameter. To incorporate
covariates, we extend the Generalized Additive Models (GAM) framework to
discrete extreme responses. In the GAM forms, the parameters of our proposed
models are quantified as a function of covariates. The maximum likelihood
estimation procedure is implemented for estimation purposes. With the advantage
of bypassing the threshold selection step, our findings indicate that the
proposed models are more flexible and robust than competing models (i.e.
discrete generalized Pareto distribution and Poisson distribution).

optimizers in DNN training. This is because the second-order training utilizes
the inversion of the second-order information (SOI) matrix to find a more
accurate descent direction and step size. However, the huge SOI matrices bring
significant computational and memory overheads in the traditional architectures
like GPU and CPU. On the other side, the ReRAM-based process-in-memory (PIM)
technology is suitable for the second-order training because of the following
three reasons: First, PIM's computation happens in memory, which reduces data
movement overheads; Second, ReRAM crossbars can compute SOI's inversion in
$O\left(1\right)$ time; Third, if architected properly, ReRAM crossbars can
perform matrix inversion and vector-matrix multiplications which are important
to the second-order training algorithms.
  Nevertheless, current ReRAM-based PIM techniques still face a key challenge
for accelerating the second-order training. The existing ReRAM-based matrix
inversion circuitry can only support 8-bit accuracy matrix inversion and the
computational precision is not sufficient for the second-order training that
needs at least 16-bit accurate matrix inversion. In this work, we propose a

automatic differentiation to compute relevant derivatives efficiently and
accurately. The complete set of critical exponents characteristic of a
second-order phase transition was obtained. Correlations near the critical
temperature were analyzed through two impurity tensors inserted into the
system, which allowed us to obtain the correlation lengths and calculate the
critical exponent $\nu$. The critical exponent $\alpha$ was found to be
negative, consistent with the observation that the specific heat does not
diverge at the critical temperature. The extracted exponents satisfy the known
relations given by various scaling assumptions within reasonable accuracy.
Perhaps most interestingly, the hyperscaling relation, which contains the
spatial dimension, is satisfied very well, assuming the Hausdorff dimension
takes the place of the spatial dimension. Moreover, using automatic
differentiation, we have extracted four critical exponents ($\alpha$, $\beta$,
$\gamma$, and $\delta$) globally by differentiating the free energy.
Surprisingly, the global exponents differ from those obtained locally by the
technique of the impurity tensors; however, the scaling relations remain
satisfied even in the case of the global exponents.

on the design of loss functions and the selection of the distilled layers,

of the projector with empirical evidence and then propose a new feature
distillation method based on a projector ensemble for further performance
improvement. We observe that the student network benefits from a projector even

a student backbone without a projector can be considered as a multi-task
learning process, namely achieving discriminative feature extraction for
classification and feature matching between the student and the teacher for
distillation at the same time. We hypothesize and empirically verify that
without a projector, the student network tends to overfit the teacher's feature
distributions despite having different architecture and weights initialization.
This leads to degradation on the quality of the student's deep features that
are eventually used in classification. Adding a projector, on the other hand,
disentangles the two learning tasks and helps the student network to focus
better on the main feature extraction task while still being able to utilize
teacher features as a guidance through the projector. Motivated by the positive
effect of the projector in feature distillation, we propose an ensemble of
projectors to further improve the quality of student features. Experimental

described using the Flory--Huggins mean-field theory. However, this theory is
problematic when applied to polymer gels with large solvent contents owing to
the significant fluctuations in polymer concentration. In this study, we
experimentally demonstrate the superiority of the semidilute scaling law over
the mean-field theory for predicting the swelling of polymer gels. Using the
semidilute scaling law, we experimentally determine the universal critical
exponent $\nu$ of the self-avoiding walk via swelling experiments on polymer
gels. The experimentally obtained value $\nu\simeq 0.589$ is consistent with
the previously reported value of $\nu\simeq 0.588$, which was obtained by
precise numerical calculations. Furthermore, we theoretically derive and
experimentally demonstrate a scaling law that governs the equilibrium

$c^{*}$ theorem. A major deficiency of the $c^*$ theorem is that the network
elasticity, which depends on the as-prepared state, is neglected. These
findings reveal that the semidilute scaling law is a fundamental principle for
accurately predicting and controlling the equilibrium swelling of polymer gels.

simulations. Schur complement techniques and massively parallel multigrid
solvers for second-order elliptic partial differential equations can
significantly benefit from reduced memory traffic and consumption. The
matrix-free approach often restricts solver components to purely local
operations, for instance, the Jacobi- or Gauss--Seidel-Smoothers in multigrid
methods. An incomplete LU (ILU) decomposition cannot be calculated from local
information and is therefore not amenable to an on-the-fly computation which is
typically needed for matrix-free calculations. It generally requires the
storage and factorization of a sparse matrix which contradicts the low memory
requirements in large scale scenarios. In this work, we propose a matrix-free
ILU realization. More precisely, we introduce a memory-efficient, matrix-free
ILU(0)-Smoother component for low-order conforming finite elements on
tetrahedral hybrid grids. Hybrid grids consist of an unstructured macro-mesh
which is subdivided into a structured micro-mesh. The ILU(0) is used for
degrees-of-freedom assigned to the interior of macro-tetrahedra. This
ILU(0)-Smoother can be used for the efficient matrix-free evaluation of the
Steklov-Poincare operator from domain-decomposition methods. After introducing
and formally defining our smoother, we investigate its performance on refined
macro-tetrahedra. Secondly, the ILU(0)-Smoother on the macro-tetrahedrons is
implemented via surrogate matrix polynomials in conjunction with a fast
on-the-fly evaluation scheme resulting in an efficient matrix-free algorithm.
The polynomial coefficients are obtained by solving a least-squares problem on
a small part of the factorized ILU(0) matrices to stay memory efficient. The
convergence rates of this smoother with respect to the polynomial order are
thoroughly studied.

examples of superconducting quantum circuits that have shown rapid progress in
recent years. With the growing complexity of such devices, the requirements for
reproducibility of their electrical properties across a chip have become
stricter. Thus, the critical current $I_c$ variation of the Josephson junction,
as the most important electrical parameter, needs to be minimized. Critical
current, in turn, is related to normal-state resistance the Ambegaokar-Baratoff
formula, which can be measured at room temperature. Here, we focus on the
dominant source of Josephson junction critical current non-uniformity junction
area variation. We optimized Josephson junctions fabrication process and
demonstrate resistance variation of $9.8-4.4\%$ and $4.8-2.3\%$ across
$22{\times}22$ $mm^2$ and $5{\times}10$ $mm^2$ chip areas, respectively. For a
wide range of junction areas from $0.008$ ${\mu}m^2$ to $0.12$ ${\mu}m^2$ we
ensure a small linewidth standard deviation of $4$ $nm$ measured over 4500

model time and marks of the event together for practical relevance. Conditioned
on past events, marked TPPs aim to learn the joint distribution of the time and
the mark of the next event. For simplicity, conditionally independent TPP
models assume time and marks are independent given event history. They
factorize the conditional joint distribution of time and mark into the product
of individual conditional distributions. This structural limitation in the
design of TPP models hurt the predictive performance on entangled time and mark
interactions. In this work, we model the conditional inter-dependence of time
and mark to overcome the limitations of conditionally independent models. We
construct a multivariate TPP conditioning the time distribution on the current

and reduce toxicity of radiotherapy, but existing data-driven motion models are
based on either patient-specific or population data. We propose to combine
population and patient-specific data using a Bayesian framework. Our goal is to
accurately predict individual motion patterns while using fewer scans than
previous models.
  Approach: We have derived and evaluated two Bayesian deformation models. The
models were applied retrospectively to the rectal wall from a cohort of
prostate cancer patients. These patients had repeat CT scans evenly acquired
throughout radiotherapy. Each model was used to create coverage probability
matrices (CPMs). The spatial correlations between these CPMs and ``true'' CPMs,
derived from independent scans of the same patient, were calculated.
  Main results: Spatial correlation with ground truth were significantly higher
for the Bayesian deformation models than both patient-specific and
population-derived models with 1, 2 or 3 patient-specific scans as input.
Statistical motion simulations indicate that this result will also hold for
more than 3 scans.
  Significance: The improvement over known models means that fewer scans per
patient are needed to achieve accurate deformation predictions. The models have
applications in robust radiotherapy planning and evaluation, among others.

mortality from cancer worldwide and has various histologic types, among which
LUAC has recently been the most prevalent. LUACs are classified as
pre-invasive, minimally invasive, and invasive adenocarcinomas. Timely and
accurate knowledge of the lung nodules malignancy leads to a proper treatment
plan and reduces the risk of unnecessary or late surgeries. Currently, chest CT
scan is the primary imaging modality to assess and predict the invasiveness of
LUACs. However, the radiologists' analysis based on CT images is subjective and
suffers from a low accuracy compared to the ground truth pathological reviews
provided after surgical resections. The proposed hybrid framework, referred to
as the CAET-SWin, consists of two parallel paths: (i) The Convolutional
Auto-Encoder (CAE) Transformer path that extracts and captures informative
features related to inter-slice relations via a modified Transformer
architecture, and; (ii) The Shifted Window (SWin) Transformer path, which is a
hierarchical vision transformer that extracts nodules' related spatial features
from a volumetric CT scan. Extracted temporal (from the CAET-path) and spatial
(from the Swin path) are then fused through a fusion path to classify LUACs.
Experimental results on our in-house dataset of 114 pathologically proven
Sub-Solid Nodules (SSNs) demonstrate that the CAET-SWin significantly improves
reliability of the invasiveness prediction task while achieving an accuracy of
82.65%, sensitivity of 83.66%, and specificity of 81.66% using 10-fold

system carrying the information of the local operator. This is usually studied
via the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). We study the information
propagation from one end of a periodically driven spin-1/2 $XY$ chain with open
boundary conditions using the Floquet infinite-temperature OTOC. We calculate
the OTOC for two different spin operators, $\sigma^x$ and $\sigma^z$, and find
that they show quite different behaviors. The OTOC for the spin operator which
is local in terms of Jordan-Wigner fermions ($\sigma^z$) shows no signature of
information scrambling inside the light cone of propagation. On the contrary,
the OTOC for the spin operator which is non-local in terms of Jordan-Wigner
fermions ($\sigma^x$) shows signatures of scrambling inside the light cone. For
sinusoidal driving, the model can be shown to host different types of Majorana
edge states, namely topological zero quasienergy edge states and anomalous edge
states. The two different types of edge states influence the information
propagation in different ways. We observe a localization of information at the
edge for both $\sigma^z$ and $\sigma^x$ OTOCs whenever edge states are present.
In addition, in the case of anomalous edge states, we see oscillations of the
OTOC in time near the edge, the oscillation period being inversely proportional
to the gap between the Floquet eigenvalues of the edge states. We provide an
analytical understanding of these effects due to the edge states. We also
observe an `unscrambling effect' in the $\sigma^x$ OTOC after reflection at the
other end of the system. Finally, we demonstrate that the information
propagates into the system mainly via the bulk states with the maximum value of
the group velocity, and we show how this velocity is controlled by the driving
frequency and amplitude.

deeply nested conditions than were tested with humans. Further, reanalyzing the

difficult structures initially. Thus, large LMs may indeed process recursively

the fivebrane decoupling limit, worldsheet string theory on a family of such
backgrounds is given by exactly solvable null-gauged WZW models. We construct
physical vertex operators in these cosets, including all massless fluctuations.
We first compute a large class of novel heavy-light-light-heavy correlators in
the AdS$_3$ limit, where the light operators include those dual to chiral
primaries of the holographically dual CFT. We compare a subset of these
correlators to the holographic CFT at the symmetric product orbifold point, and
find precise agreement in all cases, including for light operators in twisted
sectors of the orbifold CFT. The agreement is highly non-trivial, and includes
amplitudes that describe the analogue of Hawking radiation for these
microstates. We further derive a formula for worldsheet correlators consisting
of $n$ light insertions on these backgrounds, and discuss which subset of these
correlators are likely to be protected. As a test, we compute a heavy-light
five-point function, obtaining precisely the same result both from the

  mitigation","12 pages, 5 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Virtual distillation has been proposed as an error mitigation protocol for
estimating the expectation values of observables in quantum algorithms. It
proceeds by creating a cyclic permutation of $M$ noisy copies of a quantum
state using a sequence of controlled-swap gates. If the noise does not shift
the dominant eigenvector of the density operator away from the ideal state,
then the error in expectation-value estimation can be exponentially reduced
with $M$. In practice, subsequent error-mitigation techniques are required to
suppress the effect of noise in the cyclic permutation circuit itself, leading
to increased experimental complexity. Here, we perform a careful analysis of
noise in the cyclic permutation circuit and find that the estimation of
expectation value of observables diagonal in the computational basis is robust
against dephasing noise. We support the analytical result with numerical
simulations and find that $67\%$ of errors are reduced for $M=2$, with physical
dephasing error probabilities as high as $10\%$. Our results imply that a broad
class of quantum algorithms can be implemented with higher accuracy in the
near-term with qubit platforms where non-dephasing errors are suppressed, such
as superconducting bosonic qubits and Rydberg atoms.

resolving dynamic fine structure of smaller than 0.05'', the finite acquisition
time of typically 11 s affects the measurement process and potentially causes
errors in deduced physical parameters. We estimate those errors and investigate
ways of minimising them.
  We mimic the solar surface using a magneto-hydrodynamic simulation with a
spatially averaged vertical field strength of 200 G. We simulate the
measurement process scanning through successive wavelength points with a
temporal cadence of 1 s. We synthesise FeI 617.3 nm. Besides the classical
composition of the line profile, we introduce a novel method in which the
intensity in each wavelength point is normalised using the simultaneous
continuum intensity. Milne-Eddington inversions are used to infer the
line-of-sight velocity, v(los), and the vertical (longitudinal) component of
the magnetic field, B(los).
  We quantify systematic errors, defining the temporal average of the
simulation during the measurement as the truth. We find that with the classical
composition of the line profiles, errors exceed the sensitivity for v(los) and
in filigree regions also for B(los). The novel method that includes
normalisation reduces the measurement errors in all cases. Spatial binning
without reducing the acquisition time decreases the measurement error slightly.
  The evolutionary time-scale in inter-granular lanes, in particular in areas
with magnetic features (filigree), is shorter than the time-scale within
granules. Hence less accumulations could be used for strong magnetic field in
inter-granular lanes and more accumulations could be used for the weak granular
magnetic fields. As a key result, we suggest to include the novel method of
normalisation in corresponding data pipelines.

influences escape anyone's control. They are, instead, dominated by aggregate
societal properties such as size, polarization, cohesion, or hierarchy. Such
features add nuance and complexity to social structure, and might be present,
or not, for societies of different sizes. How do societies become more complex?
Are there specific scales at which they are reorganized into emergent entities?
In this paper we introduce the {\em social complexity spectrum}, a
methodological tool, inspired by theoretical considerations about dynamics on
complex networks, that addresses these questions empirically. We use as a probe
a sociolinguistic process that has unfolded over decades within the
north-western Spanish region of Galicia, across populations of varied sizes. We
estimate how societal complexity increases monotonously with population size;
and how specific scales stand out, at which complexity would build up faster.
These scales are noted as dips in our spectra, similarly to missing wavelengths
in light spectroscopy. Also, `red-' and `blue-shifts' take place as the general
population shifted from more rural to more urban settings. These shifts help us
sharpen our observations. Besides specific results around social complexity
build-up, our work introduces a powerful tool to be applied in further study
cases.

patch-based non-semantic negative samples to boost the noise robustness of the
pre-training model, which is achieved by dividing the features into patches at
different sizes (i.e., so-called negative samples). Second, by analyzing the
distribution of positive and negative samples, we propose to remove the easily
distinguishable negative samples to improve the discriminative capacity for
pre-training models. Experimental results on the CHiME-4 dataset show that our
method is able to improve the performance of the pre-trained model in noisy

learning approach named dial2vec. Dial2vec considers a dialogue as an
information exchange process. It captures the conversational interaction
patterns between interlocutors and leverages them to guide the learning of the
embeddings corresponding to each interlocutor. The dialogue embedding is
obtained by an aggregation of the embeddings from all interlocutors. To verify
our approach, we establish a comprehensive benchmark consisting of six
widely-used dialogue datasets. We consider three evaluation tasks: domain
categorization, semantic relatedness, and dialogue retrieval. Dial2vec achieves
on average 8.7, 9.0, and 13.8 points absolute improvements in terms of purity,
Spearman's correlation, and mean average precision (MAP) over the strongest
baseline on the three tasks respectively. Further analysis shows that dial2vec
obtains informative and discriminative embeddings for both interlocutors under
the guidance of the conversational interactions and achieves the best
performance when aggregating them through the interlocutor-level pooling
strategy. All codes and data are publicly available at

neighbouring qubits are dynamically equivalent. However, there is a conceptual
distinction to account for: neighbouring qubits may be controlled. We combine
recent advances in non-Markovian quantum process tomography with the framework
of classical shadows to characterise spatiotemporal quantum correlations.
Observables here constitute operations applied to the system, where the free
operation is the maximally depolarising channel. Using this as a causal break,
we systematically erase causal pathways to narrow down the progenitors of
temporal correlations. We show that one application of this is to filter out
the effects of crosstalk and probe only non-Markovianity from an inaccessible
bath. It also provides a lens on spatiotemporally spreading correlated noise
throughout a lattice from common environments. We demonstrate both examples on
synthetic data. Owing to the scaling of classical shadows, we can erase
arbitrarily many neighbouring qubits at no extra cost. Our procedure is thus
efficient and amenable to systems even with all-to-all interactions.

statistical approach to estimate the number of enemy tanks produced or on the
field from observed serial numbers after battles. Assuming that the tanks are
labeled consecutively starting from 1, if we observe $k$ tanks from a total of
$N$ tanks with the maximum observed tank being $m$, then the best estimate for
$N$ is $m(1 + 1/k) - 1$. We explore many generalizations. We looked at the
discrete and continuous one dimensional case. We explored different estimators
such as the $L$\textsuperscript{th} largest tank, and applied motivation from
portfolio theory and studied a weighted average; however, the original formula
was the best. We generalized the problem in two dimensions, with pairs instead
of points, studying the discrete and continuous square and circle variants.
There were complications from curvature issues and that not every number is
representable as a sum of two squares. We often concentrated on the large $N$
limit. For the discrete and continuous square, we tested various statistics,
finding the largest observed component did best; the scaling factor for both
cases is $(2k+1)/2k$. The discrete case was especially involved because we had
to use approximation formulas that gave us the number of lattice points inside
the circle. Interestingly, the scaling factors were different for the cases.
Lastly, we generalized the problem into $L$ dimensional squares and circles.
The discrete and continuous square proved similar to the two dimensional square
problem. However, for the $L$\textsuperscript{th} dimensional circle, we had to
use formulas for the volume of the $L$-ball, and had to approximate the number
of lattice points inside it. The formulas for the discrete circle were
particularly interesting, as there was no $L$ dependence in the formula.

resulting in a good quantitative agreement between methods (i) and (ii).
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the DMI is highly tunable by strain, stacking,

ferromagnetic/heavy metal (FM/HM) interfaces. The geometrical change and
hybridization effect explain the origin of the high tunability of the DMI at
the interface. The electric-field driven DMI obtained by method (iii) is in
qualitative agreement with the more accurate \textit{ab initio} method used in

drastically changed by the application of compressive or tensile strain in the

consequence, we get that $n(k,l)<\lfloor \frac{2kl}{3}\rfloor$ when $k\geq 5$,
which shows that the above conjecture is not true in general. In fact, the
difference between the exact value of $n(k,l)$ and the conjectured value grows
linearly in terms of $k$. Our results also generalize the case of $k=2,3,4$.

capturing only changes in local brightness levels. They are widely known as
event cameras, silicon retinas or dynamic vision sensors (DVS). DVS records
asynchronous per-pixel brightness changes, resulting in a stream of events that

direction, and has attracted more and more attention. Recent work design a

paper propose a new intuitive and explicit accent intensity control scheme for
accented TTS. Specifically, we first extract the posterior probability, called
as ``goodness of pronunciation (GoP)'' from the L1 speech recognition model to
quantify the phoneme accent intensity for accented speech, then design a
FastSpeech2 based TTS model, named Ai-TTS, to take the accent intensity

real-life acoustic scenes can be reliably recognized based only on the features

treated as a node, while the relationship cues derived from each pair of event
embeddings are described by a learned multidimensional edge feature.
Experiments on a polyphonic acoustic scene dataset show that the proposed ERGL
achieves competitive performance on ASC by using only a limited number of
embeddings of audio events without any data augmentations. The validity of the
proposed ERGL framework proves the feasibility of recognizing diverse acoustic
scenes based on the event relational graph. Our code is available on our

a body of liquid is a classical problem. In the related problem of a droplet
splashing on a flat surface, it has been established that the properties of the
surrounding gas can influence the splashing threshold. At lower impact speeds,
this is due mainly to the influence of gas kinetic effects, since the height of
the gas lubrication film which is displaced during dynamic wetting is often
comparable to the mean free path of the gas. At higher Weber and Reynolds
numbers, on the other hand, inertial effects dominate and the density of the
gas becomes important in determining whether a splash occurs. In this article,
sphere impacts on a liquid body are investigated in a rarefied atmosphere using
high-speed photography. It is found that the threshold entry speed for cavity
formation is influenced by the density of the surrounding gas, whereas changing
the mean free path of the gas has no effect. We attribute this phenomenon to
the gas slowing the sealing of the thin crown sheet behind the sphere. This
assertion is supported with experimental measurements of the liquid sheet
thickness. In the range of parameters considered, the splash crown influences
the movement of the contact line, an effect not previously observed.

from spurious correlations between input text and output expression. To
mitigate this issue, we propose a self-consistent reasoning framework called
SCR, which attempts to adopt a pruning strategy to correct the output

Specifically, we firstly obtain a sub-network by pruning a roberta2tree model,
for the sake to use the gap on output distribution between the original
roberta2tree model and the pruned sub-network to expose spurious correlative
samples. Then, we calibrate the output distribution shift by applying symmetric
Kullback-Leibler divergence to alleviate spurious correlations. In addition,
SCR generates equivalent expressions, thereby, capturing the original text's
logic rather than relying on hints from original text. Extensive experiments on

  Estimation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Stereo correspondence matching is an essential part of the multi-step stereo
depth estimation process. This paper revisits the depth estimation problem,
avoiding the explicit stereo matching step using a simple two-tower
convolutional neural network. The proposed algorithm is entitled as 2T-UNet.
The idea behind 2T-UNet is to replace cost volume construction with twin
convolution towers. These towers have an allowance for different weights
between them. Additionally, the input for twin encoders in 2T-UNet are
different compared to the existing stereo methods. Generally, a stereo network
takes a right and left image pair as input to determine the scene geometry.
However, in the 2T-UNet model, the right stereo image is taken as one input and
the left stereo image along with its monocular depth clue information, is taken
as the other input. Depth clues provide complementary suggestions that help
enhance the quality of predicted scene geometry. The 2T-UNet surpasses
state-of-the-art monocular and stereo depth estimation methods on the
challenging Scene flow dataset, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The
architecture performs incredibly well on complex natural scenes, highlighting
its usefulness for various real-time applications. Pretrained weights and code
will be made readily available.

regarding the emergence of criticality. Unfortunately, these associational
approaches may yield spurious inferences, or worse, fail to recognize the
causalities leading to critical scenarios, which are, in turn, prerequisite for
the development and safeguarding of automated driving systems. As to
incorporate causal knowledge within these processes, this work introduces a
formalization of causal queries whose answers facilitate a causal understanding
of safety-relevant influencing factors for automated driving. This formalized
causal knowledge can be used to specify and implement abstract safety
principles that provably reduce the criticality associated with these
influencing factors. Based on Judea Pearl's causal theory, we define a causal
relation as a causal structure together with a context, both related to a
domain ontology, where the focus lies on modeling the effect of such
influencing factors on criticality as measured by a suitable metric. As to
assess modeling quality, we suggest various quantities and evaluate them on a
small example. As availability and quality of data are imperative for validly
estimating answers to the causal queries, we also discuss requirements on
real-world and synthetic data acquisition. We thereby contribute to
establishing causal considerations at the heart of the safety processes that
are urgently needed as to ensure the safe operation of automated driving

is the weakness of the reflection features in their X-ray spectra, which can
result from the gradual disappearance of the torus with decreasing accretion
rates. It has been suggested that low luminosity AGN (LLAGN) would have a
different reflector configuration compared with high luminosity AGN, either
covering a smaller fraction of the sky or simply having less material.
Additionally, we note that the determination of the spectral index ($\Gamma$)
and the cut-off energy of the primary power-law emission is affected by the
inclusion of reflection models, showing the importance of using them to study
the accretion mechanism, especially in the case of the LLAGN that have
previously shown a high dispersion on the relation between $\Gamma$ and the
accretion rate. Our purpose is to constrain the geometry and column density of
the reflector in a sample of LLAGN covering a broad X-ray range of energy
combining data from XMM-Newton + NuSTAR + Swift of a hard X-ray-flux limited
sample of 17 LLAGN from BASS/DR2 with accretion rates $\lambda_{Edd}$=L$_{\rm
Bol}$/L$_{\rm Edd}$<10$^{-3}$. We fit all spectra using the reflection model
for torus (borus02) and accretion disk (Xillver) reflectors. We found a
tentative correlation between the torus column density and the accretion rate,
LLAGN shows a lower column density compared with the high-luminosity objects.
We also confirm the relation between $\Gamma$ and $\lambda_{Edd}$, with a
smaller scatter than previously reported, thanks to the inclusion of
high-energy data and the reflection models. Our results are consistent with a
break at $\lambda_{Edd}\sim10^{-3}$, suggestive of a different accretion
mechanism compared with higher accretion AGN.

derivation of a new modelling technique. We first showcase the use of efficient
optimization routines to automatize the process of field inversion in the
context of CFD, combined with the use of symbolic algebra solvers to generate
sparse-efficient algebraic formulas to comply with the discrete adjoint method.
The proposed neural network architecture is characterized by the use of an
initial layer of logarithmic neurons followed by hyperbolic tangent neurons,
which proves numerically stable. The machine learning predictions are then
corrected using a novel weighted relaxation factor methodology, that recovers
valuable information from otherwise spurious predictions. The study uses the
K-fold cross-validation technique, which is beneficial for small datasets. The
results show that the machine learning model acts as an excellent non-linear
interpolator for DNS cases well-represented in the training set, and that
moderate improvement margins are obtained for sparser DNS cases. It is
concluded that the developed machine learning methodology corresponds to a
valid alternative to improve RANS turbulence models in flows with strong

previous work robust saliency (ROSA) shuffles the pre-segmented superpixels and
then refines the coarse saliency map by the densely connected conditional
random field (CRF). Different from ROSA that relies on various pre- and

defend adversarial attacks for SOD models. LeNo preserves accuracy of SOD
models on both adversarial and clean images, as well as inference speed. In
general, LeNo consists of a simple shallow noise and noise estimation that
embedded in the encoder and decoder of arbitrary SOD networks respectively.
Inspired by the center prior of human visual attention mechanism, we initialize
the shallow noise with a cross-shaped gaussian distribution for better defense

statistical learning problem is referred to as data-driven inverse

how they should interact. On the one hand, systems based on SQL provide ad-hoc
rules for numerical nulls, on the other, theoretical research largely
concentrates on the standard notions of certain and possible answers. In the
presence of numerical attributes and aggregates, however, these answers are
often meaningless, returning either too little or too much. Our goal is to
define a principled framework for databases with numerical nulls and answering
queries with arithmetic and aggregations over them.
  Towards this goal, we assume that missing values in numerical attributes are
given by probability distributions associated with marked nulls. This yields a
model of probabilistic bag databases in which tuples are not necessarily
independent, since nulls can repeat. We provide a general compositional
framework for query answering, and then concentrate on queries that resemble
standard SQL with arithmetic and aggregation. We show that these queries are
measurable, and that their outputs have a finite representation. Moreover,
since the classical forms of answers provide little information in the
numerical setting, we look at the probability that numerical values in output
tuples belong to specific intervals. Even though their exact computation is
intractable, we show efficient approximation algorithms to compute such
probabilities.

  Recently, Yuan, Tibouchi and Abe (2022) introduced a variant to the subset

total energy consumption minimization problem by a joint optimization of
subcarrier allocation, task input bits, time slot allocation, transmit power
allocation and RMS transmissive coefficient while taking into account the
constraints of communication resources and computing resources. This formulated
problem is a non-convex optimization problem due to the high coupling of
optimization variables, which is NP-hard to obtain its optimal solution. To
address the above challenging problems, block coordinate descent (BCD)
technique is employed to decouple the optimization variables to solve the

BCD. Then, the decoupled three subproblems are optimized alternately by using
successive convex approximation (SCA) and difference-convex (DC) programming
until the convergence is achieved. Numerical results verify that our proposed
algorithm is superior in reducing total energy consumption compared to other

normally require abundant face videos and synchronously recorded
photoplethysmography (PPG) signals for supervision. However, the collection of
these annotated corpora is uneasy in practice. In this paper, we introduce a
novel frequency-inspired self-supervised framework that learns to estimate rPPG
signals from face videos without the need of ground truth PPG signals. Given a
video sample, we first augment it into multiple positive/negative samples which
contain similar/dissimilar signal frequencies to the original one.
Specifically, positive samples are generated using spatial augmentation.
Negative samples are generated via a learnable frequency augmentation module,
which performs non-linear signal frequency transformation on the input without
excessively changing its visual appearance. Next, we introduce a local rPPG
expert aggregation module to estimate rPPG signals from augmented samples. It
encodes complementary pulsation information from different face regions and
aggregate them into one rPPG prediction. Finally, we propose a series of
frequency-inspired losses, i.e. frequency contrastive loss, frequency ratio
consistency loss, and cross-video frequency agreement loss, for the
optimization of estimated rPPG signals from multiple augmented video samples
and across temporally neighboring video samples. We conduct rPPG-based heart

problem, and is also of importance in understanding of the transport mechanisms

influenced by the capillary and viscous forces, but also affected by the
channel geometry. In this paper, we first present a mathematical model to
describe the two-phase fluid displacement in the pore doublet where the effects
of capillary force, viscous force and the geometric structure are included.
Then we derive an analytical solution of the model for the first time, and find
that the displacement process is dominated by the capillary number, the
viscosity ratio and the radius ratio. Furthermore, we define the optimal
displacement that the wetting fluids in two daughter channels break through the
branches simultaneously (both of them have the same breakthrough time), and
also obtain the critical capillary number corresponding to the optimal
displacement, which is related to the radius ratio of two daughter channels and
viscosity ratio of two immiscible fluids. Finally, it is worthy noting that the
present analytical results on the displacement in the pore doublet can be used
to explain and understand the phenomenon of preferential imbibition or

related to conceptual modeling and is often viewed as a specification of a
conceptualization. Accordingly, conceptual modeling and ontology engineering
now address the same problem of representing the world in a suitable fashion. A
high-level ontology provides a means to describe concepts and their
interactions with each other and to capture structural and behavioral features
in the intended domain. This paper aims to analyze ontological concepts and
semantics of modeling notations to provide a common understanding among
software engineers. An important issue in this context concerns the question of
whether the modeled world might be stratified into ontological levels. We
introduce an abstract system of two-level domain ontology to be used as a
foundation for conceptual models. We study the two levels of staticity and
dynamics in the context of the thinging machine (TM) model using the notions of
potentiality and actuality that the Franco-Romanian philosopher Stephane
Lupasco developed in logic. He provided a quasi-universal rejection of
contradiction where every event was always associated with a no event, such
that the actualization of an event entails the potentialization of a no event
and vice versa without either ever disappearing completely. This approach is
illustrated by re-modeling UML state machines in TM modeling. The results
strengthen the semantics of a static versus dynamic levels in conceptual
modeling and sharpen the notion of events as a phenomenon without negativity

random walks which require to infer transition matrices that formalize the
underlying stochastic process in an observed graph. For weighted graphs, it is
common to estimate the entries of such transition matrices based on the
relative weights of edges. However, we are often confronted with incomplete
data, which turns the construction of the transition matrix based on a weighted
graph into an inference problem. Moreover, we often have access to additional
information, which capture topological constraints of the system, i.e. which
edges in a weighted graph are (theoretically) possible and which are not, e.g.
transportation networks, where we have access to passenger trajectories as well
as the physical topology of connections, or a set of social interactions with
the underlying social structure. Combining these two different sources of
information to infer transition matrices is an open challenge, with
implications on the downstream network analysis tasks.
  Addressing this issue, we show that including knowledge on such topological
constraints can improve the inference of transition matrices, especially for
small datasets. We derive an analytically tractable Bayesian method that uses
repeated interactions and a topological prior to infer transition matrices
data-efficiently. We compare it against commonly used frequentist and Bayesian
approaches both in synthetic and real-world datasets, and we find that it
recovers the transition probabilities with higher accuracy and that it is
robust even in cases when the knowledge of the topological constraint is
partial. Lastly, we show that this higher accuracy improves the results for
downstream network analysis tasks like cluster detection and node ranking,
which highlights the practical relevance of our method for analyses of various

genuine human speech compared to spoofed speech. The main focus of this paper

  We introduce a new feature extraction method for speech audio signals: unlike
traditional methods, our method is based on direct processing of time-domain
audio samples. The PMF is utilized by designing a feature extractor based on
different PMF distances and similarity measures. As an additional step, we used
filter-bank preprocessing, which significantly affects the discriminative
characteristics of the features and facilitates convenient visualization of
possible clustering of spoofing attacks. Furthermore, we use diffusion maps to
reveal the underlying manifold on which the data lies.
  The suggested embeddings allow the use of simple linear separators to achieve
decent performance. In addition, we present a convenient way to visualize the
data, which helps to assess the efficiency of different spoofing techniques.
  The experimental results show the potential of using multi-channel PMF based
features for the anti-spoofing task, in addition to the benefits of using
diffusion maps both as an analysis tool and as an embedding tool.

traces in Learning Management System (LMS) to understand students' learning
behavior patterns including aspects of meta-cognition and self-regulation, with
the ultimate goal to turn those insights into actionable information to support
students to improve their learning outcomes. In achieving this goal, however,
there are two main issues that need to be addressed given the existing
literature. Firstly, most of the current work is course-centered (i.e. models
are built from data for a specific course) rather than student-centered;
secondly, a vast majority of the models are correlational rather than causal.
Those issues make it challenging to identify the most promising actionable
factors for intervention at the student level where most of the campus-wide
academic support is designed for. In this paper, we explored a student-centric
analytical framework for LMS activity data that can provide not only
correlational but causal insights mined from observational data. We
demonstrated this approach using a dataset of 1651 computing major students at
a public university in the US during one semester in the Fall of 2019. This
dataset includes students' fine-grained LMS interaction logs and administrative
data, e.g. demographics and academic performance. In addition, we expand the
repository of LMS behavior indicators to include those that can characterize
the time-of-the-day of login (e.g. chronotype). Our analysis showed that
student login volume, compared with other login behavior indicators, is both
strongly correlated and causally linked to student academic performance,
especially among students with low academic performance. We envision that those
insights will provide convincing evidence for college student support groups to
launch student-centered and targeted interventions that are effective and

the correct behavior of such DNN-Enabled Systems (DES) is a crucial topic.
Online testing is one of the promising modes for testing such systems with
their application environments (simulated or real) in a closed loop taking into
account the continuous interaction between the systems and their environments.
However, the environmental variables (e.g., lighting conditions) that might
change during the systems' operation in the real world, causing the DES to
violate requirements (safety, functional), are often kept constant during the
execution of an online test scenario due to the two major challenges: (1) the
space of all possible scenarios to explore would become even larger if they
changed and (2) there are typically many requirements to test simultaneously.
In this paper, we present MORLOT (Many-Objective Reinforcement Learning for
Online Testing), a novel online testing approach to address these challenges by
combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and many-objective search. MORLOT
leverages RL to incrementally generate sequences of environmental changes while
relying on many-objective search to determine the changes so that they are more
likely to achieve any of the uncovered objectives. We empirically evaluate
MORLOT using CARLA, a high-fidelity simulator widely used for autonomous
driving research, integrated with Transfuser, a DNN-enabled ADS for end-to-end
driving. The evaluation results show that MORLOT is significantly more
effective and efficient than alternatives with a large effect size. In other

scoring and PLDA. We have recently proposed PSDA, an analog to PLDA that uses
Von Mises-Fisher distributions instead of Gaussians. In this paper, we present
toroidal PSDA (T-PSDA). It extends PSDA with the ability to model within and
between-speaker variabilities in toroidal submanifolds of the hypersphere. Like
PLDA and PSDA, the model allows closed-form scoring and closed-form EM updates

while PLDA accuracy is inferior. On NIST SRE'21 we find that T-PSDA gives large
accuracy gains compared to both cosine scoring and PLDA.

supervised (paired TTS and ASR data) and unsupervised (untranscribed speech and

synthesize reasonably intelligible and naturally sounding speech for unseen

Numerical tests from different scenarios were implemented under a comprehensive

have a minor influence on the time-intensity profiles of gradual Solar
Energetic Particle (SEP) events. For this reason many models solve the focussed
transport equation within the corotating frame, thus neglecting corotation
effects. We study the effects of corotation on gradual SEP intensity profiles
at a range of observer longitudinal positions relative to the solar source. We
study how corotation affects the duration and decay time constant of SEP events
and the variation of peak intensity with observer position. We use a 3D
full-orbit test particle code with time-extended SEP injection via a shock-like
source. Unlike with focussed transport models, the test particle approach
enables us to switch corotation on and off easily. While shock acceleration is
not modelled directly, our methodology allows us to study how corotation and
the time-varying observer-shock magnetic connection influence intensity
profiles detected at six observers. We find that corotation strongly affects
SEP profiles, for a monoenergetic population of 5 MeV protons, being a dominant
influence during the decay phase. Simulations including corotation display
dramatically shortened durations for western events, compared to those which do
not include it. When corotation is taken into account, for both eastern and
western events the decay time constant is reduced and its dependence on the
scattering mean free path becomes negligible. Corotation reduces the peak
intensity for western events and enhances it for eastern ones, thus making the
east-west asymmetry in peak intensity stronger, compared to the no-corotation
case. Modelling SEP intensity profiles without carefully accounting for
corotation leads to artificially extended decay phases during western events
and profiles with a similar shape regardless of observer longitudinal position.

systems controlled by two open-source SDN controllers. Further, we compare
FuzzSDN with two state-of-the-art methods for fuzzing SDNs and two baselines

refine the initial estimate by solving a sequence of weighted

on the estimation error, which consists of optimization error and statistical
error. The optimization error decays to zero at a linear rate, indicating that
the estimate is refined iteratively in subsequent stages, and the statistical

shorter than 7 days and orbit relatively bright FGK stars ($10.9 < G < 13.0$).
Most of the planets are comparable in mass to Jupiter, although there are four
planets with masses less than that of Saturn. TOI-3976 b, the longest period

($e = 0.18\pm0.06$), while observations of the other targets are consistent
with them being on circular orbits. We measured the projected stellar obliquity

dimension reduction and classification of hyperspectral images using
information theoretic (normalized mutual information) and support vector
machines SVM. This method consists to select a minimal subset of the most
informative and relevant bands from the input datasets for better
classification efficiency. We applied our proposed algorithm on two well-known
benchmark datasets gathered by the NASA's AVIRIS sensor over Indiana and
Salinas valley in USA. The experimental results were assessed based on
different evaluation metrics widely used in this area. The comparison with the
state of the art methods proves that our method could produce good performance
with reduced number of selected bands in a good timing.

(value) (C-PFS(V)) as a new generalization of both circular intuitionistic
fuzzy sets (C-IFSs) proposed by Atannassov and Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs)

that represents the membership degree and the non-membership degree and whose
center consists of non-negative real numbers $\mu$ and $\nu$ with the condition
$\mu^2+\nu^2\leq 1$. A C-PFS models the fuzziness of the uncertain information
more properly thanks to its structure that allows modelling the information
with points of a circle of a certain center and a radius. Therefore, a C-PFS
lets decision makers to evaluate objects in a larger and more flexible region
and thus more sensitive decisions can be made. After defining the concept of
C-PFS we define some fundamental set operations between C-PFSs and propose some
algebraic operations between C-PFVs via general $t$-norms and $t$-conorms. By
utilizing these algebraic operations, we introduce some weighted aggregation
operators to transform input values represented by C-PFVs to a single output

cosine similarity measure based on radius. Furthermore, we develop a method to
transform a collection of Pythagorean fuzzy values to a PFS. Finally, a method
is given to solve multi-criteria decision making problems in circular

confronting theoretical models with observational data. We use hydrodynamic
photoevaporative disk-wind models and post-process them with a thermo-chemical

one out of seven targets that show blueshifted NLVCs does the photoevaporative
model fail to explain the observed line kinematics. Our results also indicate
that interpreting spectral line profiles by simple methods, such as the
thin-disk approximation, to determine the line emitting region can yield
misleading conclusions. The photoevaporative disk-wind models are largely
consistent with the studied observational data set, but it is not possible to
clearly discriminate between different wind-driving mechanisms. Further
improvements to the models, such as consistent modelling of the dynamics and
chemistry and detailed modelling of individual targets would be beneficial.
Furthermore, a direct comparison of magnetically driven disk-wind models to the

Convergence analysis reveals that the VEFL training loss depends on the

full device participation case (FDPC), the edge server aggregates client model

constraints to maximize the probability of successful reception of the locally

decompose it into a VEFL parameter optimization sub-problem, given the

the possibility of dynamical fermion mass generation at finite temperature and

tunable with respect to $g$ in the former case, and both $g$ and $|B|/B_0$ in

present among a specific group of nodes. The model resolves the contradiction
between the SHM model and the Hub Attraction Dynamical Growth model, by showing
that repulsion is the characteristic that induces fractality. The Lattice

directly influences the node distances. Through LSwTM we study the
fractal-small-world transition. The model illustrates the transition on a fixed

the pair are not isomorphic. For example, we prove that any pair containing a
C*-algebra with Kirchberg's QWEP property is a Tsirelson pair. We then
introduce the notion of a C*-algebra with the Tsirelson property (TP) and
establish a number of closure properties for this class. We also show that the
class of C*-algebras with the TP form an axiomatizable class (in the sense of
model theory), but that this class admits no ""effective"" axiomatization.

serious security threat due to the wide adoption of face biometrics in the real

amount of training data and have only been tested on a few predefined attack
models. The lack of good generalization properties, especially in view of the
growing interest in developing novel morphing attacks, is a critical limitation
with existing MAD research. To address this issue, we propose to extend MAD
from supervised learning to few-shot learning and from binary detection to
multiclass fingerprinting in this paper. Our technical contributions include:
1) We propose a fusion-based few-shot learning (FSL) method to learn
discriminative features that can generalize to unseen morphing attack types
from predefined presentation attacks; 2) The proposed FSL based on the fusion
of the PRNU model and Noiseprint network is extended from binary MAD to
multiclass morphing attack fingerprinting (MAF). 3) We have collected a
large-scale database, which contains five face datasets and eight different
morphing algorithms, to benchmark the proposed few-shot MAF (FS-MAF) method.
Extensive experimental results show the outstanding performance of our
fusion-based FS-MAF. The code and data will be publicly available at

quantum effects. Bringing together magnons, phonons, and photons in a single
physical system, it opens many opportunities for quantum technologies. It was
conventionally realized by a yttrium iron garnet, which exhibits a linear
magnon-phonon coupling $\hat{m}^\dag\hat{m}(\hat{b}^\dag+\hat{b})$, with
$\hat{m}$ and $\hat{b}$ being the magnon and phonon modes. Inspired by the
recent realization of two-dimensional (2D) magnets, we propose a new cavity
magnomechanical system with one of the cavity mirror formed by a 2D magnetic
material. Its anisotropic magnetostrictive interaction induces a unique
nonlinear phonon-magnon coupling $\hat{m}^\dag\hat{m}(\hat{b}^\dag+\hat{b})^2$.
It is found that a stable squeezing of the phonon and bi- and tri-partite
entanglements among the three modes are generated in the regimes with a
suppressed phonon number. Compared with previous schemes, ours does not require
any extra nonlinear interaction and reservoir engineering and is robust against
the thermal fluctuation. Enriching the realization of cavity magnomechanics,
our system exhibits its superiority in quantum-state engineering due to the

quantum statistics of the particles (e.g., fermions, bosons, anyons). We have
experimentally implemented these ideas by employing an electronic
Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer fed by two highly diluted electron beams in an
integer quantum Hall platform. Performing measurements of auto-correlation and
cross-correlation of current fluctuations of the scattered beams (following
'collisions'), we quantify the statistics-induced entanglement by
experimentally accessing the entanglement pointer and the statistics-induced

to study entanglement in various correlated platforms, e.g., those involving

characterized with STM without destroying the sample. This non-destructive

carried out on a periodic domain assuming either a fixed fluid volume or a
fixed flow rate for a hierarchy of models: two lubrication models with either
linearised curvature or full curvature (the LCM and FCM, respectively), and the
full equations of Stokes flow. Of particular interest is the breakdown of
travelling-wave solutions as the plate inclination angle is increased. For any
fixed volume the LCM reaches the horizontal state where it attains a
cosine-shaped profile. For sufficiently small volume, the FCM and Stokes
solutions attain a weak Young-Laplace equilibrium profile, the approach to
which is described by an asymptotic analysis generalising that of Kalliadasis &
Chang (1994) for the LCM. For large volumes, the bifurcation curves for the FCM
and Stokes model have a turning point so that the fully inverted state is never
reached. For fixed flow rate the LCM blows up at a critical angle that is well
predicted by asymptotic analysis. The bifurcation curve for the FCM either has
a turning point or else reaches a point at which the surface profile has an
infinite slope singularity, indicating the onset of multi-valuedness. The
latter is confirmed by the Stokes model which can be continued to obtain
overturning surface profiles. Overall the thin-film models either provide an
accurate prediction for dripping onset or else supply an upper bound on the

Citizen and community-science (CS) datasets have great potential for
estimating interannual patterns of population change given the large volumes of
data collected globally every year. Yet, the flexible protocols that enable
many CS projects to collect large volumes of data typically lack the structure
necessary to keep consistent sampling across years. This leads to interannual
confounding, as changes to the observation process over time are confounded
with changes in species population sizes.
  2. Here we describe a novel modeling approach designed to estimate species
population trends while controlling for the interannual confounding common in
citizen science data. The approach is based on Double Machine Learning, a
statistical framework that uses machine learning methods to estimate population
change and the propensity scores used to adjust for confounding discovered in
the data. Additionally, we develop a simulation method to identify and adjust
for residual confounding missed by the propensity scores. Using this new
method, we can produce spatially detailed trend estimates from citizen science
data.
  3. To illustrate the approach, we estimated species trends using data from
the CS project eBird. We used a simulation study to assess the ability of the
method to estimate spatially varying trends in the face of real-world
confounding. Results showed that the trend estimates distinguished between
spatially constant and spatially varying trends at a 27km resolution. There
were low error rates on the estimated direction of population change
(increasing/decreasing) and high correlations on the estimated magnitude.
  4. The ability to estimate spatially explicit trends while accounting for
confounding in citizen science data has the potential to fill important
information gaps, helping to estimate population trends for species, regions,
or seasons without rigorous monitoring data.

abundance to iron ratio gradients, and their time evolution. We selected member
stars in 62 open clusters, with ages from 0.1 to about 7~Gyr, located in the
Galactic thin disc at Galactocentric radii from about 6 to 21~kpc. We analysed
the shape of the resulting [Fe/H] gradient, the average gradients [El/H] and
[El/Fe] combining elements belonging to four different nucleosynthesis
channels, and their individual abundance and abundance ratio gradients. We also
investigated the time evolution of the gradients dividing open clusters in
three age bins. The[Fe/H] gradient has a slope of -0.054 dex~kpc-1. We saw
different behaviours for elements belonging to different channels. We found
that the youngest clusters in the inner disc have lower metallicity than their
older counterpart and they outline a flatter gradient. We considered some
possible explanations, including the effects of gas inflow and migration. We
suggested that it might be a bias introduced by the standard spectroscopic
analysis producing lower metallicities in low gravity stars. To delineate the
shape of the `true' gradient, we should limit our analysis to stars with low
surface gravity logg>2.5 and xi<1.8 km~s-1. Based on this reduced sample, we
can conclude that the gradient has minimally evolved over the time-frame
outlined by the open clusters, indicating a slow and stationary formation of
the thin disc in the latest Gyr. We found a secondary role of clusters'
migration in shaping the gradient, with a more prominent role of migration for
the oldest clusters.

networks on IoT devices is becoming increasingly crucial for edge intelligence.
Federated learning (FL) facilitates the management of edge devices to
collaboratively train a shared model while maintaining training data local and
private. However, a general assumption in FL is that all edge devices are
trained on the same machine learning model, which may be impractical
considering diverse device capabilities. For instance, less capable devices may
slow down the updating process because they struggle to handle large models
appropriate for ordinary devices. In this paper, we propose a novel data-free
FL method that supports heterogeneous client models by managing features and
logits, called Felo; and its extension with a conditional VAE deployed in the
server, called Velo. Felo averages the mid-level features and logits from the
clients at the server based on their class labels to provide the average
features and logits, which are utilized for further training the client models.
Unlike Felo, the server has a conditional VAE in Velo, which is used for
training mid-level features and generating synthetic features according to the
labels. The clients optimize their models based on the synthetic features and
the average logits. We conduct experiments on two datasets and show
satisfactory performances of our methods compared with the state-of-the-art
methods.

proof of concept where we examine the extent to which elevation profiles can be
used to predict the location of users. To tackle this problem, we devise three
plausible threat settings under which the city or borough of the targets can be
predicted. Those threat settings define the amount of information available to
the adversary to launch the prediction attacks. Establishing that simple
features of elevation profiles, e.g., spectral features, are insufficient, we
devise both natural language processing (NLP)-inspired text-like representation

We use both traditional machine learning- and deep learning-based techniques

the classical proximal gradient method. The proposed scheme can be applied to
composite minimization problems whose smooth part exhibits an anisotropic

a dual characterization of relative strong convexity in the Bregman sense. It
is proved that the anisotropic descent property is closed under pointwise
average if the dual Bregman distance is jointly convex and, more specifically,
closed under pointwise conic combinations for the KL-divergence. We analyze the
method's asymptotic convergence and prove its linear convergence under an
anisotropic proximal gradient dominance condition. This is implied by
anisotropic strong convexity, a recent dual characterization of relative
smoothness in the Bregman sense. Applications are discussed including
exponentially regularized LPs and logistic regression with nonsmooth

matrix given at a finite number of points is considered. A method for its
approximate solution is proposed. It consists in reducing the problem to a
two-spectra inverse Sturm-Liouville problem on each edge with its posterior
solution. The overall approach is based on Neumann series of Bessel functions
(NSBF) representations for solutions of Sturm-Liouville equations, and, in
fact, the solution of the inverse problem on the quantum graph reduces to
dealing with the NSBF coefficients. The NSBF representations admit estimates
for the series remainders which are independent of the real part of the square
root of the spectral parameter. This feature makes them especially useful for
solving direct and inverse problems requiring calculation of solutions on large
intervals in the spectral parameter. Moreover, the first coefficient of the
NSBF representation alone is sufficient for the recovery of the potential. The
knowledge of the Weyl matrix at a set of points allows one to calculate a
number of the NSBF coefficients at the end point of each edge, which leads to
approximation of characteristic functions of two Sturm-Liouville problems and
allows one to compute the Dirichlet-Dirichlet and Neumann-Dirichlet spectra on
each edge. In turn, for solving this two-spectra inverse Sturm-Liouville
problem a system of linear algebraic equations is derived for computing the
first NSBF coefficient and hence for recovering the potential. The proposed
method leads to an efficient numerical algorithm that is illustrated by a
number of numerical tests.

various sparse attention modules, most of which fall under one of two groups:
1) sparse attention under a hand-crafted patterns and 2) full attention
followed by a sparse variant of softmax such as $\alpha$-entmax. Unfortunately,
the first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires
quadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model
that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a
mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head
data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an
attention mask for each input. During backpropagation, a straight-through
estimator is used to flow gradients beyond the discrete sampling step and
adjust the probabilities of sampled edges based on the predictive loss. The
forward and backward cost are thus linear to the number of edges, which each
attention head can also choose flexibly based on the input. By assessing the
distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a
universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in

demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as

guarantees under realizable function approximation, the latter is only known to
be feasible under much stronger assumptions such as prohibitively expressive
discriminators. In this work, we provide guarantees for off-policy function
estimation under only realizability, by imposing proper regularization on the
MIS objectives. Compared to commonly used regularization in MIS, our
regularizer is much more flexible and can account for an arbitrary
user-specified distribution, under which the learned function will be close to
the groundtruth. We provide exact characterization of the optimal dual solution

development has attracted growing interest among scientists in various domains.
The rich and detailed spectral information provided by the hyperspectral
sensors has improved the monitoring and detection capabilities of the earth
surface substances. However, the high dimensionality of the hyperspectral
images (HSI) is one of the main challenges for the analysis of the collected
data. The existence of noisy, redundant and irrelevant bands increases the
computational complexity, induce the Hughes phenomenon and decrease the
target's classification accuracy. Hence, the dimensionality reduction is an
essential step to face the dimensionality challenges. In this paper, we propose
a novel filter approach based on the maximization of the spectral interaction
measure and the support vector machines for dimensionality reduction and
classification of the HSI. The proposed Max Relevance Max Synergy (MRMS)
algorithm evaluates the relevance of every band through the combination of
spectral synergy, redundancy and relevance measures. Our objective is to select
the optimal subset of synergistic bands providing accurate classification of
the supervised scene materials. Experimental results have been performed using
three different hyperspectral datasets: ""Indiana Pine"", ""Pavia University"" and
""Salinas"" provided by the ""NASA-AVIRIS"" and the ""ROSIS"" spectrometers.
Furthermore, a comparison with the state of the art band selection methods has
been carried out in order to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the
proposed approach.

uncertainty can be very useful for efficient geosteering operations. However,
the model errors in the prior conceptual geological models and forward
simulation of the measurements can be significant factors in the unreliable
estimations of the profiles of the geological layers. The model errors are
specifically pronounced when using a deep-neural-network (DNN) approximation
which we use to accelerate and parallelize the simulation of the measurements.
This paper presents a practical workflow consisting of offline and online
phases. The offline phase includes DNN training and building of an uncertain
prior near-well geo-model. The online phase uses the flexible iterative
ensemble smoother (FlexIES) to perform real-time assimilation of extra-deep
electromagnetic data accounting for the model errors in the approximate DNN
model. We demonstrate the proposed workflow on a case study for a historic well
in the Goliat Field (Barents Sea). The median of our probabilistic estimation
is on-par with proprietary inversion despite the approximate DNN model and
regardless of the number of layers in the chosen prior. By estimating the model
errors, FlexIES automatically quantifies the uncertainty in the layers'
boundaries and resistivities, which is not standard for proprietary inversion.

where $b_t = \sqrt{t/\log t}$, $a_t = \log(t/(\sqrt{2\pi}\log t))$, and
$\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the random walk jump probabilities. This
work solves a problem left open in Arratia (1983).
  Moreover, to investigate the influence of the mass of particles behind the
leading one, we consider initial profiles consisting of a block of $L$
particles, where $L \to \infty$ as $t \to \infty$. Gumbel limit laws, under
appropriate scaling, are obtained for $X_t$ when $L$ diverges in $t$. In
particular, there is a transition when $L$ is of order $b_t$, above which the
displacement of $X_t$ is similar to that under a infinite particle step
profile, and below which it is of order $\sqrt{t\log L}$.

  Irradiation Using Longitudinal MRI for Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy",,,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: Proton vertebral body sparing craniospinal irradiation (VBS CSI)
treats the thecal sac while avoiding the anterior vertebral bodies in effort to
reduce myelosuppression and growth inhibition. However, robust treatment
planning needs to compensate proton range uncertainty, contributing unwanted
doses within the vertebral bodies. This work aims to develop an early in vivo
radiation damage quantification method using longitudinal magnetic resonance
(MR) scans to quantify dose effect during fractionated CSI. Materials and
methods: Ten pediatric patients were enrolled in a prospective clinical trial
of proton VBS CSI receiving 23.4-36 Gy. Monte Carlo robust planning was used
with spinal clinical target volumes defined as the thecal sac and neural
foramina. T1/T2-weighted MR scans were acquired before, during, and after
treatments to detect transition from hematopoietic to less metabolically active
fatty marrow. MR signal intensity histograms at each time point were analyzed
and fitted by multi-Gaussian models to quantify radiation damages. Results:
Fatty marrow filtration was observed on MR images as early as the fifth
fraction of treatment. Maximum radiation-induced marrow damage occurred 40-50
days from the treatment start, followed by marrow regeneration. The mean damage
ratios were 0.23, 0.41, 0.59, and 0.54 corresponding to 10, 20, 40, and 60 days
from the treatment start. Conclusions: We demonstrated a non-invasive method to
identify early vertebral marrow damage based on radiation-induced fatty marrow
replacement. The proposed method can be potentially used to quantify the
quality of CSI vertebral sparing to preserve metabolically active hematopoietic
bone marrow.

To support this hypothesis, we provide experimental evidence showing that

we take advantage of metadata available for the Matterport3D dataset that,

first type says that after an action $a_t$ is performed in a state $s_t$ and
the agent has reached the new state $s_{t+1}$, the agent can decide whether
$a_t$ is permissible or not permissible in $s_t$. The second type says that
even without performing $a_t$ in $s_t$, the agent can already decide whether
$a_t$ is permissible or not in $s_t$. An action is not permissible in a state
if the action can never lead to an optimal solution and thus should not be
tried (over and over again). We incorporate the proposed SAP property and
encode action permissibility knowledge into two state-of-the-art deep RL
algorithms to guide their state-action exploration together with a virtual

coatings put a fundamental limit on sensitivity and stability of precision

mechanical loss of the coating material. Owing to their low mechanical losses,
Al\textsubscript{0.92}Ga\textsubscript{0.08}As/GaAs crystalline mirror coatings
are expected to reduce this limit. At room temperature they have demonstrated
lower Brownian thermal noise than with conventional amorphous coatings.
%However, no detailed study on the noise constituents from these coatings in
optical interferometers has been conducted. We present a detailed study on the
spatial and temporal noise properties of such coatings by using them in two
independent cryogenic silicon optical Fabry-Perot resonators operated at 4 K,
16 K and 124 K. We confirm the expected low Brownian thermal noise, but also
discover two new noise sources that exceed the Brownian noise: birefringent
noise that can be canceled via polarization averaging and global excess noise
(10 dB above Brownian noise). These new noise contributions are a barrier to
improving ultra-stable lasers and the related performance of atomic clocks, and
potentially limit the sensitivity of third-generation gravitational wave

plays an important role in the interaction between interfacial processes and

through the quantitative phase-field model, the influence of anisotropy on the
evolution of interfacial morphologies in directional solidification is
investigated. To represent different interfacial anisotropies, the
solidification processes with different preferred crystallographic orientations
are performed. Then the effect of anisotropy on morphological evolution is
discussed systematically. At the planar growth stage, the interfacial
anisotropy makes no difference in the transport processes and morphological
evolution. At the onset time of planar instability, the anisotropy determines
the detailed evolution by adjusting the interface stiffness. At the
planar-cellular-transition stage, with the influence of anisotropy, the
interfacial curvature decreases from {\theta}0=0{\deg} to {\theta}0=40{\deg}.
Hence, the solute concentration ahead of the interface increases from
{\theta}0=0{\deg} to {\theta}0=40{\deg}, while the instantaneous velocity of
the interface decreases from {\theta}0=0{\deg} to {\theta}0=40{\deg}. At the
quasi-steady-state stage, the anisotropy determines the growth direction and

Existing approaches transform a 3D protein-ligand complex to a two-dimensional

affinity. However, the node and edge features of the 2D graph are extracted
based on invariant local coordinate systems of the 3D complex. As a result, the
method can not fully learn the global information of the complex, such as, the
physical symmetry and the topological information of bonds. To address these

extra parameter cost with the growth of the number of layers. From the
dynamical system perspective of the residual neural network, we find that the
feature maps from the layers of the same stage are homogenous, which inspires
us to propose a novel-and-simple framework, called the dense and implicit
attention (DIA) unit, that shares a single attention module throughout
different network layers. With our framework, the parameter cost is independent
of the number of layers and we further improve the accuracy of existing popular
self-attention modules with significant parameter reduction without any
elaborated model crafting. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show
that the DIA is capable of emphasizing layer-wise feature interrelation and
thus leads to significant improvement in various vision tasks, including image
classification, object detection, and medical application. Furthermore, the
effectiveness of the DIA unit is demonstrated by novel experiments where we
destabilize the model training by (1) removing the skip connection of the
residual neural network, (2) removing the batch normalization of the model, and
(3) removing all data augmentation during training. In these cases, we verify
that DIA has a strong regularization ability to stabilize the training, i.e.,
the dense and implicit connections formed by our method can effectively recover

gradient thus alleviate the training instability.

real-time estimation and calibration of dynamic demand models by focusing on
disaggregated microsimulation in congested networks. The calibration approach
is based on sequential optimization demand estimation for short time frames and
uses a stream of traffic count data from IoT sensors on selected roads. The
proposed method builds upon the standard bi-level optimization formulation. The
upper-level optimization problem is presented as a bounded variable quadratic
programming in each time frame, making it computationally tractable. For every
time frame, the probabilistic parameters of the route choice model are obtained
through several rounds of feedback loop between the OD optimization problem (at
the upper level) and parallel samplings and simulations for DTA (at the lower
level). At the end of each time frame, the microsimulation state of the network
is transferred to the next time frame to ensure the temporal dependency and
continuity of the estimations during the time. In addition, the algorithm's
convergence is accelerated by applying the fixed-point method to road-segment
travel times. The proposed sequential calibration model presents a drastic
computational advantage over available methods by splitting the computations
into short time frames and under the assumption that the demand in each time
frame only depends on current and previous time frames. The model does not
depend on reliable prior demand information. Moreover, with receiving the field
measurements as a stream and the efficient time complexity of the algorithm in
each time frame, the method successfully presents a solution for
high-dimensional real-time and online applications. We validated the method
with synthetic data and for a real-world case study in Tartu city, Estonia. The

However, DDPM requires many iterative denoising steps to generate segmentations
from Gaussian noise, resulting in extremely inefficient inference. To mitigate
the issue, we propose a principled acceleration strategy, called
pre-segmentation diffusion sampling DDPM (PD-DDPM), which is specially used for
medical image segmentation. The key idea is to obtain pre-segmentation results
based on a separately trained segmentation network, and construct noise
predictions (non-Gaussian distribution) according to the forward diffusion
rule. We can then start with noisy predictions and use fewer reverse steps to
generate segmentation results. Experiments show that PD-DDPM yields better
segmentation results over representative baseline methods even if the number of
reverse steps is significantly reduced. Moreover, PD-DDPM is orthogonal to
existing advanced segmentation models, which can be combined to further improve

However, the computational complexity of computing the pairwise similarity
matrix is high, particularly when a convolutional layer has many filters. To
reduce the computational complexity in obtaining the pairwise similarity
matrix, we propose to use an efficient method where the complete pairwise
similarity matrix is approximated from only a few of its columns by using a
Nystr\""om approximation method. The proposed efficient similarity-based passive

proposed relativistic covariant space-time approach supposes that all massive
particles are composite particles formed by massless elementary particles with
opposite four-dimensional (4D) helicity. The attraction between two basic
particles originates from their mutual 4D density, which depends only on their
4D distance. The approach enables a consistent description of the internal
structure of massive elementary particles including the origin of their spin,
their mass, and the sign of their charge. The 4D rotational Hamiltonian depends
on the hyper-symmetric potential obtained by using the mutual density for the
source term of the 4D Poisson equation. The rotational eigenfunctions depend on
the 4D radius and on three angles, one of which is imaginary. This angle
accounts for the rotation of the time-like axis with respect to the
three-dimensional subspace representing a Lorentz transformation. We obtain the
wave equation of the basic particles by supposing that they are propagating
with the speed of light. Such subatomic massless particles are photons,
basic-quarks, and neutrinos, which we assume to be massless if they are free.
The results of the analytical calculations show that massive particles can only
be stable if the potential is a 4D well trapping the constituents. As a result,
we do not need the Higgs field for explaining the origin of the mass. In
particular, we show that electrons and positrons are such two-component systems
each consisting of two photons. The eigenvalue of the 4D rotational energy
determines the mass of the composite particle. We prove the relevance of the
novel theory by revisiting the hydrogen atom. The resulting energy eigenvalues
depend on three quantum numbers having no degenerated energy states. In
particular, it provides the Lamb shift.

scattered wave traveling to a depth shallower than the object plane while
suppressing the deeper penetrating portion that travels across the object plane

attenuate the multiply scattered waves by a factor of 1/1000 or smaller,

Mechanism-based computation following PDEs has long been an essential paradigm
for studying topics such as computational fluid dynamics, multiphysics
simulation, molecular dynamics, or even dynamical systems. It is a vibrant
multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary
potential. At the same time, solving PDEs efficiently has been a long-standing
challenge. Generally, except for a few differential equations for which
analytical solutions are directly available, many more equations must rely on
numerical approaches such as the finite difference method, finite element
method, finite volume method, and boundary element method to be solved
approximately. These numerical methods usually divide a continuous problem
domain into discrete points and then concentrate on solving the system at each
of those points. Though the effectiveness of these traditional numerical
methods, the vast number of iterative operations accompanying each step forward
significantly reduces the efficiency. Recently, another equally important
paradigm, data-based computation represented by deep learning, has emerged as
an effective means of solving PDEs. Surprisingly, a comprehensive review for
this interesting subfield is still lacking. This survey aims to categorize and

SFG does. We show that the lost OAM with the opposite sign that maintains OAM

evolution will then encode the information being processed by the tract due to
the interaction of the quantum state of the ions at the nodes with the

  lattice-mismatched substrates",,,,,"physics.optics cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  High-quality factor plasmonic devices are crucial components in the fields of
nanophotonics, quantum computing and sensing. The majority of these devices are
required to be fabricated on non-lattice matched or transparent amorphous
substrates. Plasmonic devices quality factor is mainly defined by ohmic losses,
scattering losses at grain boundaries, and in-plane plasmonic scattering losses
of a metal - substrate system. Here, we demonstrate the deposition technique to
e-beam evaporate ultralow-loss silver thin films on transparent
lattice-mismatched substrates. The process is based on evolutionary selection
growth. The key feature of our approach is a well-defined control of deposition
on a cooled substrate, self-crystallization and subsequent annealing for
precise stress relaxation that promote further grains growth. We are able to
deposit 100-nm thick ultraflat polycrystalline silver films with
micrometer-scale grains and ultralow optical losses. Finally, we show
ultra-high-quality factor plasmonic silver nanostructures on transparent
lattice-mismatched substrate comparable to epitaxial silver. This can be of the
great interest for high performance or single-molecule optical sensorics
applications.
