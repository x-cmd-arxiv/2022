closed subschemes. In order to do this, we first establish some general formal
gluing results for moduli of almost perfect complexes, perfect complexes and
torsors. We then construct a simplicial object of flags of closed subschemes of
a smooth projective surface $X$, naturally associated to the operation of
taking union of flags. We prove that this simplicial object has the $2$-Segal

weak microwave signals close to the quantum limit with large bandwidth, which

the operation of single-photon detectors. While the large bandwidth allows for
their use in frequency-multiplexed detection architectures, an increased number
of readout tones per amplifier puts more stringent requirements on the dynamic
range to avoid saturation. Here, we characterize the undesired mixing processes
between the different frequency-multiplexed tones applied to a Josephson
traveling wave parametric amplifier, a phenomenon also known as intermodulation
distortion. The effect becomes particularly significant when the amplifier is
operated close to its saturation power. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
intermodulation distortion can lead to significant crosstalk and reduction of
fidelity for multiplexed readout of superconducting qubits. We suggest using
large detunings between the pump and signal frequencies to mitigate crosstalk.
Our work provides insights into the limitations of current Josephson traveling
wave parametric amplifiers and highlights the importance of performing further

However, there is a lack of comprehensive and systematic study on this
important aspect to demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-step methods in
solving highly complex continuous control problems. In this study, we introduce
a new long $N$-step surrogate stage (LNSS) reward approach to effectively
account for complex environment dynamics while previous methods are usually
feasible for limited number of steps. The LNSS method is simple, low
computational cost, and applicable to value based or policy gradient
reinforcement learning. We systematically evaluate LNSS in OpenAI Gym and

been challenging to obtain good results by DRL in general. We demonstrate
performance improvement in terms of total reward, convergence speed, and
coefficient of variation (CV) by LNSS. We also provide analytical insights on
how LNSS exponentially reduces the upper bound on the variances of Q value from

Machine Learning, Optimization and Engineering problems. In particular, it has
been widely used in Software Engineering for Test-case generation, Program
Synthesis and Improvement of Software (GI).
  Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming (GGGP) approaches allow the user to refine
the domain of valid program solutions. Backus Normal Form is the most popular
interface for describing Context-Free Grammars (CFG) for GGGP. BNF and its
derivatives have the disadvantage of interleaving the grammar language and the
target language of the program.
  We propose to embed the grammar as an internal Domain-Specific Language in
the host language of the framework. This approach has the same expressive power
as BNF and EBNF while using the host language type-system to take advantage of
all the existing tooling: linters, formatters, type-checkers, autocomplete, and
legacy code support. These tools have a practical utility in designing software
in general, and GP systems in particular.
  We also present Meta-Handlers, user-defined overrides of the tree-generation
system. This technique extends our object-oriented encoding with more
practicability and expressive power than existing CFG approaches, achieving the
same expressive power of Attribute Grammars, but without the grammar vs target
language duality.
  Furthermore, we evidence that this approach is feasible, showing an example
Python implementation as proof. We also compare our approach against textual
BNF-representations w.r.t. expressive power and ergonomics. These advantages do
not come at the cost of performance, as shown by our empirical evaluation on 5
benchmarks of our example implementation against PonyGE2. We conclude that our
approach has better ergonomics with the same expressive power and performance

exist in one- or two-dimensional (2D) isotropic magnets with short-ranged
interactions. The theorem has been a milestone in magnetism and has been
driving the research of recently discovered 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic
materials from fundamentals up to potential applications. In such systems, the
existence of magnetic ordering is typically attributed to the presence of a
significant magnetic anisotropy, which is known to introduce a spin-wave gap
and circumvent the core assumption of the theorem. Here we show that in
finite-size 2D vdW magnets typically found in lab setups (e.g., within
millimetres), short-range interactions can be large enough to allow the
stabilisation of magnetic order at finite temperatures without any magnetic
anisotropy for practical implementations. We demonstrate that magnetic ordering
can be created in flakes of 2D materials independent of the lattice symmetry
due to the intrinsic nature of the spin exchange interactions and finite-size
effects in two-dimensions. Surprisingly we find that the crossover temperature,
where the intrinsic magnetisation changes from superparamagnetic to a
completely disordered paramagnetic regime, is weakly dependent on the system
length, requiring giant sizes (e.g., of the order of the observable universe
~10$^{26}$ m) in order to observe the vanishing of the magnetic order at
cryogenic temperatures as expected from the Mermin-Wagner theorem. Our findings
indicate exchange interactions as the main driving force behind the
stabilisation of short-range order in 2D magnetism and broaden the horizons of
possibilities for exploration of compounds with low anisotropy at an atomically
thin level.

DePT plugs visual prompts into the vision Transformer and only tunes these
source-initialized prompts during adaptation. We find such parameter-efficient
finetuning can efficiently adapt the model representation to the target domain
without overfitting to the noise in the learning objective. Second, DePT
bootstraps the source representation to the target domain by memory bank-based
online pseudo-labeling. A hierarchical self-supervised regularization specially
designed for prompts is jointly optimized to alleviate error accumulation
during self-training. With much fewer tunable parameters, DePT demonstrates not
only state-of-the-art performance on major adaptation benchmarks VisDA-C,
ImageNet-C, and DomainNet-126, but also superior data efficiency, i.e.,
adaptation with only 1\% or 10\% data without much performance degradation

it must be used as is, without requiring any fine-tuning at test time, (b) it
must be able to process an arbitrary number of novel objects concurrently while
supporting an arbitrary number of examples from each class and (c) it must
achieve accuracy comparable to a closed system. While there are (relatively)

predicted at the output of the decoder. Importantly, we show that our system is

empirical distributions in a multitude of applications. In this connection, it
is commonly applied to asymmetric distributions. However, there is no rigorous
mathematical foundation establishing what is meant by kurtosis of an asymmetric
distribution and what is required to measure it properly. All corresponding
proposals in the literature centre the comparison with respect to kurtosis
around some measure of central location. Since this either disregards critical
amounts of information or is too restrictive, we instead revisit a canonical
approach that has barely received any attention in the literature. It reveals
the non-transitivity of kurtosis orderings due to an intrinsic entanglement of
kurtosis and skewness as the underlying problem. This is circumvented by
restricting attention to sets of distributions with equal skewness, on which
the proposed kurtosis ordering is shown to be transitive. Moreover, we
introduce a functional that preserves this order for arbitrary asymmetric
distributions. As application, we examine the families of Weibull and
sinh-arsinh distributions and show that the latter family exhibits a
skewness-invariant kurtosis behaviour.

exhibits progressive sharpening of the NTK eigenvalue towards a value that
differs slightly from the edge of stability, which we explicitly compute. In
higher dimensions, the model generically shows similar behavior, even without
the specific structure of a neural network, suggesting that progressive
sharpening and edge-of-stability behavior aren't unique features of neural
networks, and could be a more general property of discrete learning algorithms
in high-dimensional non-linear models.

to study sedimentation-diffusion-equilibrium of a mass-polydisperse colloidal

identical. The model helps to understand the interplay between gravity and
polydispersity on sedimentation experiments. Since the theory can be applied to
any parent distribution of buoyant masses, it can be also used to study
sedimentation of monodisperse colloidal systems. We find that
mass-polydispersity has a strong influence in colloidal systems near density

have characteristic velocities of about 70 km/s. However, deep and fast
encounters also take place, albeit with lower probability, particularly if one
of the objects involved is a stellar remnant ejected during a supernova. WD
0810-353 might be a high velocity white dwarf, and it was recently identified
as heading straight for the Solar System; however, the Gaia DR3 data that
support its future deep and fast flyby are regarded as suspicious.
  Aims. Here, we reanalyze the Gaia DR3 data set associated with WD 0810-353 to
confirm or reject the reality of its Solar System flyby and also to investigate
its possible runaway status.
  Methods. We studied the evolution of WD 0810-353 forward in time using N-body
simulations. We computed the distribution of distances of closest approach and
their associated times of perihelion passage. We used a statistical analysis of
the kinematics of this object to assess its possible hypervelocity. We compared
its mean BP/RP spectrum to those of other well-studied white dwarfs.
  Results. We confirm that WD 0810-353 is headed for the Solar System, but the
actual parameters of the encounter depend strongly on its radial velocity. The
Gaia DR3 value of -373.74+/-8.18 km/s is strongly disfavored by our analyses.
Its mean BP/RP spectrum suggests a value over ten times higher based on the
position of its putative Halpha line. However, spectral matching using other
white dwarfs with non-Gaia data indicate a radial velocity in the interval
(-60, -70) km/s.
  Conclusions. These results confirm the future flyby of WD 0810-353 near the
Solar System, although the relative velocity could be high enough or the
minimum approach distance large enough to preclude any significant perturbation
on the Oort cloud.

apply statistical learning and similarity analysis over the raw data. However,
similarity analysis in streaming data remains a complex problem due to time

This prioritization dictates which controlled interventions are studied,

that influence this decision-making, but interventions with larger effect size
are often favored because they exert the greatest influence on the system
studied. To inform these decisions, scientists must compare effect size across
studies with dissimilar experiment designs to identify the interventions with
the largest effect. These studies are often only loosely related in nature,
using experiments with a combination of different populations, conditions,
timepoints, measurement techniques, and experiment models that measure the same

compare effect size across studies in a meritocracy between competing

this can lead to biased predictions when the assumption does not hold. This
paper introduces Clayton-boost, a boosting approach built upon the accelerated
failure time model, which uses a Clayton copula to handle the dependency
between the event and censoring distributions. By taking advantage of a copula,
the independent censoring assumption is not needed any more. During comparisons
with commonly used methods, Clayton-boost shows a strong ability to remove
prediction bias at the presence of dependent censoring and outperforms the
comparing methods either if the dependency strength or percentage censoring are
considerable. The encouraging performance of Clayton-boost shows that there is
indeed reasons to be critical about the independent censoring assumption, and
that real-world data could highly benefit from modelling the potential
dependency.

addressing this problem by modeling relational patterns in triples. However,
the link prediction task often requires contextual information in entity

Additionally, little attention is paid to the diversity of entity
representations in different contexts, which often leads to false prediction
results. In this situation, we consider that the schema of knowledge graph

preserving the consistency of entities across contexts. In this paper, we
propose a novel Schema-augmented Multi-level contrastive LEarning framework

exploit network schema as the prior constraint to sample negatives and
pre-train our model by employing a multi-level contrastive learning method to
yield both prior schema and contextual information. Then we fine-tune our model
under the supervision of individual triples to learn subtler representations
for link prediction. Extensive experimental results on four knowledge graph

of our proposed framework against state-of-the-art baselines. The

the double-adiabatic expansion of the solar wind alone. The angle dependencies
suggest that perpendicular heating in Alfv\'enic wind may be responsible. We
quantify the occurrence rate of the two instabilities as a function of the
length of unstable intervals as they are convected over the spacecraft. This
analysis indicates that mirror-mode and oblique firehose instabilities require
a spatial interval of length greater than 2 to 3 unstable wavelengths in order
to relax the plasma into a marginally stable state and thus closer to

methods to both handle exponentially large Hilbert spaces and represent the
influence of (infinite) particle and energy reservoirs. These two requirements
are at odds with each other: Larger collections of modes can increase the
fidelity of the reservoir representation but come at a substantial
computational cost when included in numerical many-body techniques. An
increasingly utilized and natural approach to control the growth of the
reservoir is to cast a finite set of reservoir modes themselves as an open
quantum system. There are, though, many routes to do so. Here, we introduce an
accumulative reservoir construction -- an ARC -- that employs a series of
partial refreshes of the extended reservoirs. Through this series, the
representation accumulates the character of an infinite reservoir. This
provides a unified framework for both continuous (Lindblad) relaxation and a
recently introduced periodically refresh approach (i.e., discrete resets of the
reservoir modes to equilibrium). In the context of quantum transport, we show
that the phase space for physical behavior separates into discrete and
continuous relaxation regimes with the boundary between them set by natural,
physical timescales. Both of these regimes ""turnover"" into regions of over- and
under-damped coherence in a way reminiscent of Kramers' crossover. We examine
how the range of behavior impacts errors and the computational cost, including
within tensor networks. These results provide the first comparison of distinct
extended reservoir approaches, showing that they have different scaling of
error versus cost (with a bridging ARC regime decaying fastest). Exploiting the
enhanced scaling, though, will be challenging, as it comes with a substantial
increase in (operator space) entanglement entropy.

side length of 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc. Two of the regions evolve within a larger
overdense region while the other evolves within a more `normal' region. The
simulation suite has spatial and mass resolution capable of resolving the
formation of the first galaxies and MBHs within each region. We report here, as
the first in a series of papers, the evolution of the simulation suite up to
the point where star formation has commenced in each region and for 2 Myr after
the onset of star formation. Within these environments the masses of the first
objects to form have masses between approximately 100 M$_{\odot}$ and $10^4$
M$_{\odot}$. The larger mass objects form due to both major mergers, which
trigger rapid mass inflow to the centre of the halo, and also through multiple
minor mergers which allows the host halo to grow to close to the atomic cooling
threshold. In both scenarios the initially very high accretion rates quickly
grow the objects to close to $10^4$ M$_{\odot}$. However, accretion halts after
less than 50,000 years due to gas starvation. The final fate of these objects
in terms of fragmentation and subsequent fragment mergers cannot be deduced at

are likely to form super-massive stars before contracting to the main sequence
evolving into massive population III stars and subsequently MBHs.

cluster in M81 challenges traditional FRB formation mechanisms based on
magnetic activity in young neutron stars formed recently in core-collapse
supernovae. Furthermore, the detection of this repeater in such a nearby galaxy
implies a high local universe rate of similar events in globular clusters.
Building off the properties inferred from the M81 FRB, we predict the number of
FRB sources in nearby ($d \lesssim 20\,$Mpc) galaxies with large globular
cluster systems known. Incorporating the uncertain burst energy distribution,
we estimate the rate of bursts detectable in these galaxies by radio
instruments such as FAST and MeerKat. Of all local galaxies, we find M87 is the
best candidate for FRB detections. We predict M87's globular cluster system
contains $\mathcal{O}(10)$ FRB sources at present and that a dedicated radio
survey (by FAST or MeerKat) of $\mathcal{O}(10)\,$hr has a $90\%$ probability
of detecting a globular cluster FRB in M87. The detection of even a handful of
additional globular cluster FRBs would provide invaluable constraints on FRB
mechanisms and population properties. Previous studies have demonstrated young
neutron stars formed following collapse of dynamically-formed massive white
dwarf binary mergers may provide the most natural mechanism for these bursts.
We explore the white dwarf merger scenario using a suite of $N$-body cluster
models, focusing in particular on such mergers in M87 clusters. We describe a
number of outstanding features of this scenario that in principle may be
testable with an ensemble of observed FRBs in nearby globular clusters.

  Corresponding author: Joshua S. Dillon",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report the most sensitive upper limits to date on the 21 cm epoch of
reionization power spectrum using 94 nights of observing with Phase I of the
Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). Using similar analysis techniques
as in previously reported limits (HERA Collaboration 2022a), we find at 95%
confidence that $\Delta^2(k = 0.34$ $h$ Mpc$^{-1}$) $\leq 457$ mK$^2$ at $z =
7.9$ and that $\Delta^2 (k = 0.36$ $h$ Mpc$^{-1}) \leq 3,496$ mK$^2$ at $z =
10.4$, an improvement by a factor of 2.1 and 2.6 respectively. These limits are
mostly consistent with thermal noise over a wide range of $k$ after our data
quality cuts, despite performing a relatively conservative analysis designed to
minimize signal loss. Our results are validated with both statistical tests on
the data and end-to-end pipeline simulations. We also report updated
constraints on the astrophysics of reionization and the cosmic dawn. Using
multiple independent modeling and inference techniques previously employed by
HERA Collaboration (2022b), we find that the intergalactic medium must have
been heated above the adiabatic cooling limit at least as early as $z = 10.4$,
ruling out a broad set of so-called ""cold reionization"" scenarios. If this
heating is due to high-mass X-ray binaries during the cosmic dawn, as is
generally believed, our result's 99% credible interval excludes the local
relationship between soft X-ray luminosity and star formation and thus requires
heating driven by evolved low-metallicity stars.

slow, in part due to a lack of detection elsewhere in the Galaxy or in external
galaxies. Recent highly sensitive radio continuum observations of radio
galaxies in galaxy clusters have revealed remarkable isolated filamentary
structures in the ICM that are linked to radio jets, tails and lobes. The
origin of this class of filaments is not understood either. Here, we argue that
the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the creation of the two
populations are the same because of their similarity in morphology, spacing
between the filaments, aspect ratio, magnetic energy densities to thermal
pressure of the medium, and that both populations have undergone synchrotron
aging. These similarities provide an opportunity to investigate the physical
processes in the ISM and ICM for the first time. We consider that the origin of
the filaments in both the GC and ICM is a result of the interaction of a
large-scale wind with clouds, or the filaments arise through the stretching and
collection of field lines by turbulence in weakly magnetized medium. We examine
these ideas toward four radio galaxy filaments associated with four radio
galaxies IC 40B, IC 4496, J1333-3141, ESO137-006 and argue that much can be
understood in the future by comparing these two populations of filaments.

such a wavefunction accurately captures all the essential features revealed by
exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group simulations in a

transition in the phase diagram is accompanied by a change of the hole
composite from a tight charge-spin binding to a loosely-bound hole-spin pair.
In the latter, the hole carries a \emph{finite} spin current but with vanishing
charge current in the degenerate ground states. We show that the charge of the
hole composite here is dynamically diminished due to an internal relative
hole-spin motion, which is fundamentally distinct from a simple charge-spin
separation in a one-dimensional case. We further show that the same effect is
also responsible for a strong pairing between two doped holes in such a

expected experimental sensitivity that this directional information would
provide. Even without directional information, we find a DUNE-like LArTPC
detector is capable of setting limits on dark matter annihilation to neutrinos
for dark matter masses above 30 MeV that are competitive with or exceed current
experimental reach. While currently-demonstrated angular resolution for
low-energy electrons is insufficient to allow any significant increase in
sensitivity, these techniques could benefit from improvements to algorithms and
the additional spatial information provided by novel 3D charge imaging
approaches. We consider the impact of such enhancements to the resolution for
electron directionality, and find that where electron-scattering events can be
distinguished from charged-current neutrino interactions, limits on dark matter
annihilation in the mass range where solar neutrino backgrounds dominate
($\lesssim 15$ MeV) can be significantly improved using directional
information, and would be competitive with existing limits using $40$
kton$\times$year of exposure.

$N_f$ fundamental flavors and $P$ Abelian hypermultiplets i.e. $P$
hypermultiplets in the determinant representation of the gauge group. These
theories are good in the Gaiotto-Witten sense if the number of fundamental
flavors obeys the constraint $N_f \geq 2N-1$ with generic $P \geq 1$, and in
contrast to the standard $U(N)$ SQCD, they do not admit an ugly regime. The IR
dualities in question arise in the window $N_f=2N+1,2N,2N-1,$ with $P=1$ in the
first case and generic $P \geq 1$ for the others. The dualities involving
$N_f=2N \pm 1$ are characterized by an IR enhancement of the Coulomb branch
global symmetry on one side of the duality, such that the rank of the emergent
global symmetry group is greater than the rank of the UV global symmetry. The
dual description makes the rank of this emergent global symmetry manifest in
the UV. In addition, one can read off the emergent global symmetry itself from
the dual quiver. We show that these dualities are related by certain field
theory operations and assemble themselves into a duality web. Finally, we show
that the $U(N)$ SQCDs with $N_f \geq 2N-1$ and $P$ Abelian hypers have
Lagrangian 3d mirrors, and this allows one to explicitly write down the 3d
mirror associated with a given IR dual pair. This paper is the first in a
series of four papers on 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Seiberg-like dualities.

molecular clouds and Milky Way like galaxies. However, most of these studies
are based on fully developed fields that have reached the saturation level,
with little work on investigating how an initial weak primordial field affects
star formation in low metallicity environments. In this paper, we investigate
the impact of a weak initial field on low metallicity dwarf galaxies. We
perform high-resolution AREPO simulations of five isolated dwarf galaxies. Two
models are hydrodynamical, two start with a primordial magnetic field of
10$^{-6} \mu$G and different sub-solar metallicities, and one starts with a
saturated field of 10$^{-2} \mu$G. All models include a non-equilibrium,
time-dependent chemical network that includes the effects of gas shielding from
the ambient ultraviolet field. Sink particles form directly from the
gravitational collapse of gas and are treated as star-forming clumps that can
accrete gas. We vary the ambient uniform far ultraviolet field, and cosmic ray
ionization rate between 1\% and 10\% of solar values. We find that the magnetic
field has little impact on the global star formation rate, which is in tension
with some previously published results. We further find that the initial field
strength has little impact on the global star formation rate. We show that an
increase in the mass fractions of both molecular hydrogen and cold gas, along
with changes in the perpendicular gas velocity dispersion and the magnetic
field acting in the weak-field model, overcome the expected suppression in star
formation.

nature and geometry of the accretion flow. Some of the X-rays from the central
corona irradiating the disc are absorbed, increasing the local disc
temperature. This gives an additional re-processed contribution to the spectral
energy distribution (SED) which is lagged and smeared relative to the driving
X-ray light-curve. We directly calculate this reverberation from the accretion
disc, creating fully time dependent SEDs for a given X-ray light-curve. We
apply this to recent intensive monitoring data on Fairall 9, and find that it
is not possible to produce the observed UV variability by X-ray reprocessing of
the observed light-curve from the disc. Instead, we find that the majority of
the variability must be intrinsic to the UV emission process, adding to
evidence from changing look AGN that this region has a structure which is quite
unlike a Shakura-Sunyaev disc. We filter out this long timescale variability
and find that reprocessing alone is still insufficient to explain even the fast
variability in our assumed geometry of a central source illuminating a flat
disc. The amplitude of reprocessing can be increased by any vertical structure
such as the BLR and/or an inner disc wind, giving a better match. Fundamentally
though the model is missing the major contributor to the variability, intrinsic
to the UV/EUV emission rather than arising from reprocessing.

the spin-1/2 triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet (TLHAF) remains
perhaps the ultimate platform to explore highly entangled quantum spin states

materials, displaying strong two-dimensionality, pseudospin-1/2 nature and no
structural disorder. We report a systematic neutron scattering study of
CsYbSe$_2$ over the full range of applied in-plane magnetic fields up to
saturation. Above saturation we establish the exact Heisenberg character of the
interactions and a weak second-neighbour coupling, $J_2/J_1 \simeq 0.03$. As
the field drives the system from the 120$^{\circ}$-ordered state through the
up-up-down phase around 1/3-magnetization and towards full polarization, the
corresponding excitation spectra evolve from continuum-like to relatively sharp
spin-wave modes in the up-up-down phase, then back to continua and back to spin
waves. We perform cylinder MPS calculations based on the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg
model that reproduce the experimental spectra with semi-quantitative accuracy,
suggesting an interpretation of the extensive continuum features in terms of
multi-magnon states. Thus our comprehensive experimental and theoretical
analysis of the unconventional field-induced spin excitations in the TLHAF
provides valuable insight into the dynamics of a broad class of quantum
many-body systems.

distinct market design innovations that have recently come to prominence as
ways to address some of the shortcomings of decentralized trading systems.
However, different deployments have chosen substantially different methods for
integrating the two innovations.
  We show here from a minimal set of axioms describing the beneficial
properties of each innovation that there is in fact only one, unique method for
integrating CFMMs into batch trading schemes that preserves all the beneficial
properties of both. Deployment of a batch trading schemes trading many assets
simultaneously requires a reliable algorithm for approximating equilibria in
Arrow-Debreu exchange markets. We study this problem when batches contain limit
orders and CFMMs. Specifically, we find that CFMM design affects the asymptotic
complexity of the problem, give an easily-checkable criterion to validate that
a user-submitted CFMM is computationally tractable in a batch, and give a
convex program that computes equilibria on batches of limit orders and CFMMs.
Equivalently, this convex program computes equilibria of Arrow-Debreu exchange
markets when every agent's demand response satisfies weak gross
substitutability and every agent has utility for only two types of assets. This
convex program has rational solutions when run on many (but not all) natural
classes of widely-deployed CFMMs.

real time containing the information of high-energy ($E \gtrsim 100$~TeV)
neutrino candidate events with moderate-to-high ($\gtrsim 30$\%) probability of
astrophysical origin. In this work, we use a recent catalog of such alert
events, which, in addition to events announced in real-time, includes events
that were identified retroactively, and covers the time period of 2011-2020. We
also search for additional, lower-energy, neutrinos from the arrival directions
of these IceCube alerts. We show how performing such an analysis can constrain
the contribution of rare populations of cosmic neutrino sources to the diffuse
astrophysical neutrino flux. After searching for neutrino emission coincident
with these alert events on various timescales, we find no significant evidence
of either minute-scale or day-scale transient neutrino emission or of steady
neutrino emission in the direction of these alert events. This study also shows
how numerous a population of neutrino sources has to be to account for the
complete astrophysical neutrino flux. Assuming sources have the same
luminosity, an $E^{-2.5}$ neutrino spectrum and number densities that follow
star-formation rates, the population of sources has to be more numerous than
$7\times 10^{-9}~\textrm{Mpc}^{-3}$. This number changes to $3\times

  Recognition","BMVC 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Precisely naming the action depicted in a video can be a challenging and
oftentimes ambiguous task. In contrast to object instances represented as nouns
(e.g. dog, cat, chair, etc.), in the case of actions, human annotators
typically lack a consensus as to what constitutes a specific action (e.g.
jogging versus running). In practice, a given video can contain multiple valid
positive annotations for the same action. As a result, video datasets often
contain significant levels of label noise and overlap between the atomic action
classes. In this work, we address the challenge of training multi-label action
recognition models from only single positive training labels. We propose two
approaches that are based on generating pseudo training examples sampled from
similar instances within the train set. Unlike other approaches that use
model-derived pseudo-labels, our pseudo-labels come from human annotations and
are selected based on feature similarity. To validate our approaches, we create
a new evaluation benchmark by manually annotating a subset of
EPIC-Kitchens-100's validation set with multiple verb labels. We present
results on this new test set along with additional results on a new version of

proposed to explain the formation of a filament in the Orion A molecular cloud.
In this mechanism, a collision between two clouds with antiparallel magnetic
fields produces a dense filament due to the magnetic tension of the reconnected
fields. The filament contains fiber-like sub-structures and is confined by a
helical magnetic field. To show whether the dense filament is capable of
forming stars, we use the \textsc{Arepo} code with sink particles to model star
formation following the formation of the CMR-filament. First, the CMR-filament
formation is confirmed with \textsc{Arepo}. Second, the filament is able to
form a star cluster after it collapses along its main axis. Compared to the
control model without magnetic fields, the CMR model shows two distinctive
features. First, the CMR-cluster is confined to a factor of $\sim4$ smaller
volume. The confinement is due to the combination of the helical field and
gravity. Second, the CMR model has a factor of $\sim2$ lower star formation
rate. The slower star formation is again due to the surface helical field that
hinders gas inflow from larger scales. Mass is only supplied to the accreting
cluster through streamers.

retain the outputs by chance. Such DNN defects would be neglected by existing
MT frameworks. Erroneous decisions, however, would likely result in successive
mis-predictions over diverse images that may exist in real-life scenarios.
  This research aims to unveil the pervasiveness of hidden DNN defects caused
by incorrect DNN decisions (but retaining consistent DNN predictions). To do
so, we tailor and optimize modern eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to identify
visual concepts that represent regions in an input image upon which the DNN
makes predictions. Then, we extend existing MT-based DNN testing frameworks to
check the consistency of DNN decisions made over a test input and its mutated

considerable number of DNN defects caused by erroneous decisions. We conduct
human evaluations to justify the validity of our findings and to elucidate
their characteristics. Through the lens of DNN decision-based metamorphic
relations, we re-examine the effectiveness of metamorphic transformations

bounds when the learner has access to a generative model. We show that there
exists a worst-case SSP instance with $S$ states, $A$ actions, minimum cost
$c_{\min}$, and maximum expected cost of the optimal policy over all states
$B_{\star}$, where any algorithm requires at least
$\Omega(SAB_{\star}^3/(c_{\min}\epsilon^2))$ samples to return an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability. Surprisingly, this implies
that whenever $c_{\min}=0$ an SSP problem may not be learnable, thus revealing
that learning in SSPs is strictly harder than in the finite-horizon and
discounted settings. We complement this result with lower bounds when prior
knowledge of the hitting time of the optimal policy is available and when we
restrict optimality by competing against policies with bounded hitting time.
Finally, we design an algorithm with matching upper bounds in these cases. This
settles the sample complexity of learning $\epsilon$-optimal polices in SSP
with generative models.
  We also initiate the study of learning $\epsilon$-optimal policies without
access to a generative model (i.e., the so-called best-policy identification
problem), and show that sample-efficient learning is impossible in general. On
the other hand, efficient learning can be made possible if we assume the agent
can directly reach the goal state from any state by paying a fixed cost. We
then establish the first upper and lower bounds under this assumption.
  Finally, using similar analytic tools, we prove that horizon-free regret is
impossible in SSPs under general costs, resolving an open problem in
(Tarbouriech et al., 2021c).

concept drift, might induce severe (potentially catastrophic) impacts on

machine and deep learning models that are able to track and adapt to concept
drift. Typically, techniques to handle concept drift are either active or

re-train the learning algorithm when concept drift is detected. Passive

is endowed with a foliation structure along a preferred time direction. In
curved backgrounds, the target-space geometry is equipped with two distinct
metrics, and the interacting sigma model is power-counting renormalizable. At
low energies, the theory naturally flows toward the relativistic sigma model
where Lorentz symmetry emerges. In the superspace formalism, we develop a heat
kernel method that is covariantized with respect to the bimetric target-space
geometry, using which we evaluate the one-loop beta-functions of the Lifshitz
sigma model. This study forms an essential step toward a thorough understanding
of the quantum critical supermembrane as a candidate high-energy completion of
the relativistic supermembrane.

enforcing sparsity in the weights of the input layers of the dynamics models.
We first verify the effectiveness of our method in the scenario where the exact
causal-structures of time-series are known as a priori. We next apply our
method to a real-world problem, namely tsunami forecasting, where the exact

that machine learning methods can outperform classical statistical methodology
at the characterization of anomalous diffusion in both the inference of the

and the determination of the underlying diffusive regime which produced such
trajectories (Task 2). Furthermore, of the five teams that finished in the top
three across both tasks of the AnDi challenge, three of those teams used
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). While RNNs, like the long short-term memory
(LSTM) network, are effective at learning long-term dependencies in sequential
data, their key disadvantage is that they must be trained sequentially. In
order to facilitate training with larger data sets, by training in parallel, we
propose a new transformer based neural network architecture for the
characterization of anomalous diffusion. Our new architecture, the
Convolutional Transformer (ConvTransformer) uses a bi-layered convolutional
neural network to extract features from our diffusive trajectories that can be
thought of as being words in a sentence. These features are then fed to two
transformer encoding blocks that perform either regression or classification.
To our knowledge, this is the first time transformers have been used for
characterizing anomalous diffusion. Moreover, this may be the first time that a
transformer encoding block has been used with a convolutional neural network
and without the need for a transformer decoding block or positional encoding.
Apart from being able to train in parallel, we show that the ConvTransformer is
able to outperform the previous state of the art at determining the underlying
diffusive regime in short trajectories (length 10-50 steps), which are the most

properties. We combine an existing sample of 75 UV extinction curves based on
IUE and FUSE data, with atomic and molecular column densities measured through
UV absorption. The H$_2$ column density data are based on existing Lyman-Werner
absorption band models from earlier work on the extinction curves. Literature
values for the HI column density were compiled, and improved for 23 stars by
fitting a Ly$\alpha$ profile to archived spectra. We discover a strong
correlation between the H$_2$ column and the far-UV extinction, and the
underlying cause is a linear relationship between H$_2$ and the strength of the
far-UV rise feature. This extinction does not scale with HI, and the total H
column scales best with $A(V)$ instead. The carrier of the far-UV rise
therefore coincides with molecular gas, and further connections are shown by
comparing the UV extinction features to the molecular fraction. Variations in
the gas-to-extinction ratio $N(\rm{H})/A(V)$ correlate with the UV-to-optical
extinction ratio, and we speculate this could be due to coagulation or
shattering effects. Based on the H$_2$ temperature, the strongest far-UV rise
strengths are found to appear in colder and denser sightlines.

detailed balance we show that even for this relatively complex problem the
evolution towards the stationary state can be understood analytically in terms
of the stationary state of the system itself via its relation to the stationary

a regularized worst-case-regret and a new variational representation in the

date. Objectives: We built a pipeline for self-supervised (no manual labels
required) segmentation of cardiac chambers, combining computer vision, clinical
domain knowledge, and deep learning. Methods: We trained on 450 echocardiograms
(145,000 images) and tested on 8,393 echocardiograms (4,476,266 images; mean
age 61 years, 51% female), using the resulting segmentations to calculate
structural and functional measurements. We also tested our pipeline against
external images from an additional 10,030 patients (20,060 images) with
available manual tracings of the left ventricle. Results: r2 between clinically
measured and pipeline-predicted measurements were similar to reported
inter-clinician variation for LVESV and LVEDV (pipeline vs. clinical r2= 0.74
and r2=0.65, respectively), LVEF and LV mass (r2= 0.46 and r2=0.54), left and
right atrium volumes (r2=0.7 and r2=0.6), and right ventricle area (r2=0.47).
When binarized into normal vs. abnormal categories, average accuracy was 0.81
(range 0.71-0.95). A subset of the test echocardiograms (n=553) had
corresponding cardiac MRI; correlation between pipeline and CMR measurements
was similar to that between clinical echocardiogram and CMR. Finally, in the
external dataset, our pipeline accurately segments the left ventricle with an
average Dice score of 0.83 (95% CI 0.83). Conclusions: Our results demonstrate
a human-label-free, valid, and scalable method for segmentation from
ultrasound, a noisy but globally important imaging modality.

areas. The proposed methodology improves on the traditional sample survey
methods because, unlike the traditional methods, our proposed method borrows
strength from multiple data sources. Our approach is fundamentally different
from the existing small area Bayesian approach to the finite population
sampling, which typically assumes a hierarchical model for all units of the
finite population. We assume such model only for the units of the finite
population in which the outcome variable is observed; because for these units,
the assumed model can be checked using existing statistical tools. Modeling
unobserved units of the finite population is challenging because the assumed
model cannot be checked in the absence of data on the outcome variable. To make
reasonable modeling assumptions, we propose to form several cells for each
small area using factors that potentially influence the outcome variable of
interest. This strategy is expected to bring some degree of homogeneity within
a given cell and also among cells from different small areas that are
constructed with the same factor level combination. Instead of modeling true
probabilities for unobserved individual units, we assume that population means
of cells with the same combination of factor levels are identical across small
areas and the population mean of true probabilities for a cell is identical to
the mean of true values for the observed units in that cell. We apply our
proposed methodology to a real-life COVID-19 survey, linking information from
multiple disparate data sources to estimate vaccine-hesitancy rates

provide practical ways of model selection that can be applied to a wider class

label-relevant information in a rationale beyond the information already
available in the input or the label. Experiments across four benchmarks with
reasoning tasks, including chain-of-thought, demonstrate the effectiveness of
REV in evaluating rationale-label pairs, compared to existing metrics. We
further demonstrate REV is consistent with human judgments on rationale

that fluctuations of the current reveal additional information on the
scattering mechanism not available through the conductance alone. The
electronic fluctuations are coupled to the electromagnetic field and a junction
at finite bias or temperature will emit radiation. The nonsymmetrized
current-current correlators characterize the emission and absorption spectrum.
Recent interest is focused on the so-called delta-T noise, which is the
nonequilibrium noise caused by a temperature difference between the terminals.
Here, we generalize the notion of delta-T noise to the nonsymmetrized
current-current correlator at finite frequencies. We investigate the spectral
density for energy-independent scattering and for a resonant level as an
example of energy-dependent scattering. We find that a temperature difference
$\Delta T$ leads to a partial reduction of the noise for certain frequency
ranges. This is a consequence of temperature broadening in combination with a
frequency shift of the involved Fermi distributions. In the case of
energy-independent scattering, the lowest order is a quadratic $\propto (\Delta
T)^2$ correction of the thermal-like noise spectrum. For the resonance,
additional contributions to the delta-T noise spectrum arise that are $\propto
\Delta T$ to the lowest order.

augmented, and merged before any useful information can be generated. In this
paper, we propose the use and fusion of data from multiple sources, cleaned,
processed, and merged together, for use in training machine learning models to
predict transit ridership. We use data that spans a 2-year period (2020-2022)
incorporating transit, weather, traffic, and calendar data. The resulting data,
which equates to 17 million observations, is used to train separate models for
the trip and stop level prediction. We evaluate our approach on real-world
transit data provided by the public transit agency of Nashville, TN. We
demonstrate that the trip level model based on Xgboost and the stop level model
based on LSTM outperform the baseline statistical model across the entire
transit service day.

its broad utility. Here we develop a cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED)
generalization of time-dependent density functional theory and demonstrate
computationally that strong light-matter coupling can alter the de of chiral
group-directed photoisomerization of BINOL. The relative orientation of the
cavity mode polarization and the molecules in the cavity dictates the nature of
the cavity interactions, which either enhance the de of the (R)-BINOL
diasteriomer (from 17% to $\approx$ 40%) or invert the favorability to the
(S)-BINOL derivative (to $\approx$ 34% de). The latter outcome is particularly
remarkable because it indicates that the preference in diasteriomer can be
influenced via orientational control, without changing the chirality of the
directing group. We demonstrate that the observed effect stems from
cavity-induced changes to the Kohn-Sham orbitals of the ground state.

A common yet underexplored scenario is learning with class labels that
continually refine/expand old classes. For example, humans learn to recognize
${\tt dog}$ before dog breeds. In practical settings, dataset
$\textit{versioning}$ often introduces refinement to ontologies, such as
autonomous vehicle benchmarks that refine a previous ${\tt vehicle}$ class into
${\tt school-bus}$ as autonomous operations expand to new cities. This paper
formalizes a protocol for studying the problem of $\textit{Learning with
Evolving Class Ontology}$ (LECO). LECO requires learning classifiers in
distinct time periods (TPs); each TP introduces a new ontology of ""fine"" labels
that refines old ontologies of ""coarse"" labels (e.g., dog breeds that refine
the previous ${\tt dog}$). LECO explores such questions as whether to annotate
new data or relabel the old, how to leverage coarse labels, and whether to
finetune the previous TP's model or train from scratch. To answer these
questions, we leverage insights from related problems such as class-incremental
learning. We validate them under the LECO protocol through the lens of image
classification (CIFAR and iNaturalist) and semantic segmentation (Mapillary).
Our experiments lead to surprising conclusions; while the current status quo is
to relabel existing datasets with new ontologies (such as COCO-to-LVIS or
Mapillary1.2-to-2.0), LECO demonstrates that a far better strategy is to
annotate $\textit{new}$ data with the new ontology. However, this produces an
aggregate dataset with inconsistent old-vs-new labels, complicating learning.
To address this challenge, we adopt methods from semi-supervised and
partial-label learning. Such strategies can surprisingly be made near-optimal,
approaching an ""oracle"" that learns on the aggregate dataset exhaustively
labeled with the newest ontology.

than one way to execute a procedure successfully, by following the set of steps
in slightly varying orders. Thus, for successful localization in a given video,
recent works require the actual order of procedure steps in the video, to be
provided by human annotators at both training and test times. Instead, here, we
only rely on generic procedural text that is not tied to a specific video. We
represent the various ways to complete the procedure by transforming the list
of instructions into a procedure flow graph which captures the partial order of
steps. Using the flow graphs reduces both training and test time annotation
requirements. To this end, we introduce the new problem of flow graph to video
grounding. In this setup, we seek the optimal step ordering consistent with the
procedure flow graph and a given video. To solve this problem, we propose a new
algorithm - Graph2Vid - that infers the actual ordering of steps in the video
and simultaneously localizes them. To show the advantage of our proposed
formulation, we extend the CrossTask dataset with procedure flow graph
information. Our experiments show that Graph2Vid is both more efficient than
the baselines and yields strong step localization results, without the need for

We show that the velocity data are consistent with the \textit{Gaia}
astrometric orbit and provide independent evidence for a massive dark

derive a companion mass of $11.39^{+1.51}_{-1.31}$\msun. We conclude that this
binary system harbors a massive black hole on an eccentric $(e =0.46 \pm
0.02)$, $185.4 \pm 0.1$ d orbit. These conclusions are independent of
\cite{ElBadry2022Disc}, who recently reported the discovery of the same system.
A joint fit to all available data (including \cite{ElBadry2022Disc}'s) yields a

onset of the low $T/\|W\|$ instability within the central proto-neutron star

neutrino emission. Strong large-scale magnetic fields are usually invoked to
explain outstanding stellar explosions of rapidly rotating progenitors, but
their impact on the growth of such instability has not yet been cleared. We
analyze a series of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic models to
characterize the effects of different magnetic configurations on the
development of the low $T/\|W\|$ and the related multi-messenger features. In
the absence of magnetic fields, we observe the growth on dynamical time scales
of the low $T/\|W\|$, associated with a strong burst of GW and a correlated
modulation of the neutrino emission. However, models with a strong magnetic
field show a quenching of the low $T/\|W\|$, due to a flattening of the
rotation profile in the first $\sim100$ ms after shock formation caused by the
magnetic transport of angular momentum. The associated GW emission is weakened
by an order of magnitude, exhibits a broader spectral shape, and has no
dominant feature associated with the PNS large-scale oscillation modes.
Neutrino luminosities are damped along the equatorial plane due to a more
oblate PNS, and the only clear modulation in the signal is due to SASI
activity. Finally, magnetized models produce lower luminosities for $\nu_e$
than for $\bar{\nu}_e$, which is connected to a higher concentration of
neutron-rich material in the PNS surroundings.

representation for real-world decision and control problems. However, POMDPs
are notoriously difficult to solve, especially when the state and observation
spaces are continuous or hybrid, which is often the case for physical systems.
While recent online sampling-based POMDP algorithms that plan with observation
likelihood weighting have shown practical effectiveness, a general theory
characterizing the approximation error of the particle filtering techniques
that these algorithms use has not previously been proposed. Our main
contribution is bounding the error between any POMDP and its corresponding
finite sample particle belief MDP (PB-MDP) approximation. This fundamental
bridge between PB-MDPs and POMDPs allows us to adapt any sampling-based MDP
algorithm to a POMDP by solving the corresponding particle belief MDP, thereby
extending the convergence guarantees of the MDP algorithm to the POMDP.
Practically, this is implemented by using the particle filter belief transition
model as the generative model for the MDP solver. While this requires access to
the observation density model from the POMDP, it only increases the transition
sampling complexity of the MDP solver by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(C)$, where
$C$ is the number of particles. Thus, when combined with sparse sampling MDP
algorithms, this approach can yield algorithms for POMDPs that have no direct
theoretical dependence on the size of the state and observation spaces. In
addition to our theoretical contribution, we perform five numerical experiments
on benchmark POMDPs to demonstrate that a simple MDP algorithm adapted using
PB-MDP approximation, Sparse-PFT, achieves performance competitive with other
leading continuous observation POMDP solvers.

generating new (artificial) data from the same distribution. However, this
traditional viewpoint does not explain the success of prevalent augmentations
in modern machine learning (e.g. randomized masking, cutout, mixup), that
greatly alter the training data distribution. In this work, we develop a new
theoretical framework to characterize the impact of a general class of DA on

framework reveals that DA induces implicit spectral regularization through a
combination of two distinct effects: a) manipulating the relative proportion of
eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix in a training-data-dependent manner,
and b) uniformly boosting the entire spectrum of the data covariance matrix
through ridge regression. These effects, when applied to popular augmentations,
give rise to a wide variety of phenomena, including discrepancies in
generalization between over-parameterized and under-parameterized regimes and
differences between regression and classification tasks. Our framework
highlights the nuanced and sometimes surprising impacts of DA on

In addition to this, the obstacle tracking that is performed in these existent
planners is often achieved with respect to a global inertial frame, subjecting
such tracking estimates to transformation errors from odometry drift. The
proposed local planner, called dynamic gap, shifts the tracking paradigm to
modeling how the free space, represented as gaps, evolves over time. Gap
crossing and closing conditions are developed to aid in determining the
feasibility of passage through gaps, and Bezier curves are used to define a
safe navigable gap that encapsulates both local environment dynamics and
ego-robot reachability. Artificial Harmonic Potential Field (AHPF) methods that
guarantee collision-free convergence to the goal are then leveraged to generate
safe local trajectories. Monte Carlo benchmarking experiments are run in

talent space involves audio of various scenarios. Existing methods only use the
high-dimensional representation of the PANNs as the input of the decoder.
However, the low-dimension representation may retain as much audio information
as the high-dimensional representation may be neglected. In addition, although
the high-dimensional approach may predict the audio captions by learning from
existing audio captions, which lacks robustness and efficiency. To deal with
these challenges, a fusion model which integrates low- and high-dimensional

proposed dual transformer decoder structures to generate the captions in

on poorly understood aspects of massive binary stellar evolution, such as the
evolution of massive stars (including their mass-loss rates), the common
envelope phase, and the rate at which massive stars form throughout the cosmic
history of the Universe. In this paper we explore the \emph{correlated} impact
of these phases on predictions for the merger rate and chirp mass distribution
of merging binary black holes, aiming to identify possible degeneracies between
model parameters. In many of our models, a large fraction (more than 70% of
detectable binary black holes) arise from the chemically homogeneous evolution
scenario; these models tend to over-predict the binary black hole merger rate
and produce systems which are on average too massive. Our preferred models
favour enhanced mass-loss rates for helium rich Wolf--Rayet stars, in tension
with recent theoretical and observational developments. We identify
correlations between the impact of the mass-loss rates of Wolf--Rayet stars and
the metallicity evolution of the Universe on the rates and properties of

that the $\sim 10\%$ of binary black holes with chirp masses greater than $40$
M$_\odot$ (the maximum predicted by our models) are unlikely to have formed
through isolated binary evolution, implying a significant contribution (> 10%)

control law for which the Koopman generator is finite-dimensional and locally
nilpotent. We use this connection to propose a data-driven algorithm for
feedback linearization. Particularly, we use experimental data to identify the
state transformation and control feedback from a dictionary of functions for

is to predict how the course of the epidemic changes under different
countermeasures that limit interaction in the population. Most epidemiological
models do not consider the role of mutations and heterogeneity in the type of
contact events. However, pathogens have the capacity to mutate in response to
changing environments, especially caused by the increase in population immunity
to existing strains and the emergence of new pathogen strains poses a continued
threat to public health. Further, in light of differing transmission risks in
different congregate settings (e.g., schools and offices), different mitigation
strategies may need to be adopted to control the spread of infection. We
analyze a multi-layer multi-strain model by simultaneously accounting for i)
pathways for mutations in the pathogen leading to the emergence of new pathogen
strains, and ii) differing transmission risks in different congregate settings,
modeled as network-layers. Assuming complete cross-immunity among strains,
namely, recovery from any infection prevents infection with any other (an
assumption that will need to be relaxed to deal with COVID-19 or influenza), we
derive the key epidemiological parameters for the proposed multi-layer
multi-strain framework. We demonstrate that reductions to existing
network-based models that discount heterogeneity in either the strain or the
network layers can lead to incorrect predictions for the course of the

imposing/lifting mitigation measures concerning different contact network
layers (e.g., school closures or work-from-home policies) should be evaluated

beams, ubiquitous in the operation of both large-scale accelerators and
table-top microscopes. When the surface of a metal is nano-engineered with
patterns on the order of the optical wavelength, it can lead to the excitation
and confinement of surface plasmon polariton waves which drive nonlinear
photoemission. In this work, we aim to evaluate gold plasmonic nanogrooves as a
concept for producing bright electron beams for accelerators via nonlinear
photoemission. We do this by first comparing their optical properties to
numerical calculations from first principles to confirm our ability to
fabricate these nanoscale structures. Their nonlinear photoemission yield is
found by measuring emitted photocurrent as the intensity of their driving laser
is varied. Finally, the mean transverse energy of this electron source is found
using the solenoid scan technique. Our data demonstrate the ability of these
cathodes to provide a tenfold enhancement in the efficiency of photoemission
over flat metals driven with a linear process. We find that these cathodes are
robust and capable of reaching sustained average currents over 100 nA at
optical intensities larger than 2 GW/cm$^2$ with no degradation of performance.
The emittance of the generated beam is found to be highly asymmetric, a fact we
can explain with calculations involving the also asymmetric roughness of the
patterned surface. These results demonstrate the use of nano-engineered
surfaces as enhanced photocathodes, providing a robust, air-stable source of
high average current electron beams with great potential for industrial and
scientific applications.

summarize the correlation of the large-scale structure even for imaging galaxy
surveys. We have applied the projected three-dimensional correlation function,
$\xi_{\rm p}$ to measure the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) scale on the
first-three years Dark Energy Survey data. The sample consists of about 7
million galaxies in the redshift range $ 0.6 < z_{\rm p } < 1.1 $ over a
footprint of $4108 \, \mathrm{deg}^2 $. Our theory modeling includes the impact
of realistic true redshift distributions beyond Gaussian photo-$z$
approximation. To increase the signal-to-noise of the measurements, a Gaussian
stacking window function is adopted in place of the commonly used top-hat.
Using the full sample, $ D_{\rm M}(z_{\rm eff} ) / r_{\rm s} $, the ratio
between the comoving angular diameter distance and the sound horizon, is
constrained to be $ 19.00 \pm 0.67 $ (top-hat) and $ 19.15 \pm 0.58 $
(Gaussian) at $z_{\rm eff} = 0.835$. The constraint is weaker than the angular
correlation $w$ constraint ($18.84 \pm 0.50$) because the BAO signals are
heterogeneous across redshift. When a homogeneous BAO-signal sub-sample in the
range $ 0.7 < z_{\rm p } < 1.0 $ ($z_{\rm eff} = 0.845$) is considered,
$\xi_{\rm p} $ yields $ 19.80 \pm 0.67 $ (top-hat) and $ 19.84 \pm 0.53 $
(Gaussian). The latter is mildly stronger than the $w$ constraint ($19.86 \pm
0.55 $). We find that the $\xi_{\rm p} $ results are more sensitive to
photo-$z$ errors than $w$ because $\xi_{\rm p}$ keeps the three-dimensional
clustering information causing it to be more prone to photo-$z$ noise. The
Gaussian window gives more robust results than the top-hat as the former is
designed to suppress the low signal modes. $\xi_{\rm p}$ and the angular
statistics such as $w$ have their own pros and cons, and they serve an
important crosscheck with each other.

strengths of and blurs the line between synchronous and asynchronous on-policy
RL methods (SyncOnRL and AsyncOnRL, respectively). VER learns from on-policy
experience (like SyncOnRL) and has no synchronization points (like AsyncOnRL).
  VER leads to significant and consistent speed-ups across a broad range of
embodied navigation and mobile manipulation tasks in photorealistic 3D
simulation environments. Specifically, for PointGoal navigation and ObjectGoal
navigation in Habitat 1.0, VER is 60-100% faster (1.6-2x speedup) than DD-PPO,
the current state of art distributed SyncOnRL, with similar sample efficiency.
For mobile manipulation tasks (open fridge/cabinet, pick/place objects) in
Habitat 2.0 VER is 150% faster (2.5x speedup) on 1 GPU and 170% faster (2.7x

  We leverage these speed-ups to train chained skills for GeometricGoal

practical importance in condensed-matter physics and material science. Here,
using first-principles and Monte-Carlo simulations, we present that multiple
topological magnetism (i.e., skyrmion and bimeron) can survive in van der Waals
Heterostructure of MnTe2ZrS2. Arising from interlayer coupling, MnTe2ZrS2 can
harbor a large Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This, combined with
ferromagnetic exchange interaction, yields an intriguing skyrmion phase
consisting of sub-10 nm magnetic skyrmions under a tiny magnetic field of 75
mT. Meanwhile, upon harnessing a small electric field, magnetic bimeron can be
observed in MnTe2ZrS2 as well, suggesting the existence of multiple topological
magnetism. Through interlayer sliding, both topological spin textures can be
switched on-off, suggesting their stacking-dependent character. In addition,
the impacts of d and Keff on these spin textures are revealed, and a
dimensionless parameter is utilized to describe their joint effect. These
explored phenomena and insights not only are useful for fundamental research in
topological magnetism, but also enable novel applications in nanodevices.

packets are generated from small-amplitude continuous freestream pressure
forcing. Linear wave packet evolution reveals that Mack modes are the dominant
primary instabilities, followed by relatively weaker first-mode waves. The

signature, which is traced to spanwise curvature effects, and fundamental
resonance is the dominant secondary instability mechanism. At higher amplitudes
of excitation, weak signatures of sub-harmonic and oblique resonance phenomena

diminishes receptivity of first-mode waves; however, with high-amplitude

\ion{Ne}{2} present a constant expansion velocity that defines a second
kinematic component (additional plasma component). The physical conditions
imply two plasma components, with the additional plasma component having lower
temperature and higher density. The [\ion{O}{2}] density and the [\ion{N}{2}]
temperature are anomalous, but may be understood considering the contribution
of recombination to these forbidden lines. The two plasma components have very
different temperatures. The normal nebular plasma appears to be have
temperature fluctuations in part of its volume (main shell), but only small
fluctuations elsewhere. The additional plasma component contains about half of
the mass of the N$^{2+}$ and O$^{2+}$ ions, but only $3-5$\% of the mass of
H$^+$ ions, so the two plasma components have very different chemical
abundances. We estimate abundances of $12+\log(\mathrm O^{2+}/\mathrm H^+)\sim
9.2$\,dex and $\mathrm{He}/\mathrm H\sim 0.13$. Although they are all
complications, multiple plasma components, temperature fluctuations, and the
contributions of multiple physical processes to a given emission line are all
part of the reality in NGC 6153, and should generally be taken into account.

treatment, switching therapies as their disease progresses. Motivated by a
study of metastatic prostate cancer, we develop a microsimulation framework to
study therapy sequence. Methods. We propose a discrete-time state transition
model to study two lines of anti-cancer therapy. Based on digitized published
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) curves, we infer
event types (progression or death), and estimate transition probabilities using
cumulative incidence functions with competing risks. Our model incorporates
within-patient dependence over time, such that response to first-line therapy
informs subsequent event probabilities. Parameters governing the degree of
within-patient dependence can be used to calibrate the model-based results to
those of a target trial. We demonstrate these methods in a study of two therapy
sequences for metastatic prostate cancer, where Docetaxel (DCT) and Abiraterone
Acetate (AA) are both appropriate for use in either first or second line
treatment. We assess costs, Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and Incremental
Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) for two treatment strategies: DCT then AA vs AA
then DCT. Results. Using digitized survival curves from relevant clinical
trials, we identified 8.6-13.9% of PFS times that should be categorized as
deaths, allowing for estimation of cumulative incidence functions. Models
assuming within-patient independence overestimated OS time, corrected with our
calibration approach. Correction resulted in meaningful changes in the
difference in QALYs between treatment strategies (0.07 vs 0.15) and the ICER
(-\$76,836/QALY vs -\$21,030/QALY). Conclusions. Microsimulation models can be
successfully used to study cost-effectiveness of therapy sequences, taking care
to account correctly for within-patient dependence.

discrete-time analogues of nearly-periodic systems, defined as
parameter-dependent diffeomorphisms that limit to rotations along a circle
action, and they admit formal $U(1)$ symmetries to all orders when the limiting
rotation is non-resonant. For Hamiltonian nearly-periodic maps on exact
presymplectic manifolds, the formal $U(1)$ symmetry gives rise to a
discrete-time adiabatic invariant. In this paper, we construct a novel
structure-preserving neural network to approximate nearly-periodic symplectic
maps. This neural network architecture, which we call symplectic gyroceptron,
ensures that the resulting surrogate map is nearly-periodic and symplectic, and
that it gives rise to a discrete-time adiabatic invariant and a long-time

architecture for surrogate modeling of non-dissipative dynamical systems that
automatically steps over short timescales without introducing spurious

ubiquitously encountered in biological systems, energy industry, and medical
science. In this work, a novel lattice model is extended to the three-component
complex systems and criterions based on the determinant \Delta_i=F_i-K_c,i are
accordingly proposed to predict the aforementioned behaviors based on a
Helmholtz free energy formulation. Here, three characteristic factors F_i's are
introduced to describe the internal energy effect, i.e.,F_1=A^11+A^22-2A^12
(agglomeration), F_2=A^22+A^13-A^12-A^23 (adsorption) and
F_3=A^22+2A^13-A^33-2A^12 (extraction), where A_ij denotes the conservative
potential coefficient between liquid particles in phase i and j, while the
entropy factors K_c,i's in the determinants depend on the local structure of
the liquid. To verify the theoretical criterions, many-body dissipative
particle dynamics (mDPD) are employed to simulate the phase transition
phenomena in various many-body dissipative systems, including agglomeration in
a binary system, adsorption on solid surfaces from the liquid phase, and
extraction-adsorption around an immiscible liquid-liquid interface. The
simulation results show the notable dependence of the dispersed phase
distribution transition on the quasi-order parameters \Delta_i's, which
indicates the great potential of our model to analyzing various dispersed
multiphase systems. The criterions are expected to be extended to study the
structure effect induced by the temperature and dispersed particle shape on the
phase transition phenomena in those complex systems.

investigate the climate of high-obliquity planets. This model can explicitly
simulate a three-dimensional cloud distribution and vertical transports of
water vapor. We simulated exo-terrestrial climates with high resolution using
the supercomputer FUGAKU. We assumed aqua-planet configurations with 1 bar of
air as a background atmosphere, with four different obliquities ($0^{\circ}$,
$23.5^{\circ}$, $45^{\circ}$, and $60^{\circ}$). We ran two sets of
simulations: 1) low-resolution (~ 220 km-mesh as the standard resolution of a
general circulation model for exoplanetary science) with parametrization for
cloud formation, and 2) high-resolution (~ 14 km-mesh) with an explicit cloud
microphysics scheme. Results suggest that high-resolution simulations with an
explicit treatment of cloud microphysics reveal warmer climates due to less low
cloud fraction and a large amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. It implies
that treatments of cloud-related processes lead to a difference between
different resolutions in climatic regimes in cases with high obliquities.

issue caused by heavy shadows, severe road mark degradation, and serious
vehicle occlusion. As a result, discriminative lane features can be barely
learned by the network despite elaborate designs due to the inherent
invisibility of lanes in the wild. In this paper, we target at finding an
enhanced feature space where the lane features are distinctive while
maintaining a similar distribution of lanes in the wild. To achieve this, we
propose a novel Repainting and Imitating Learning (RIL) framework containing a
pair of teacher and student without any extra data or extra laborious labeling.
Specifically, in the repainting step, an enhanced ideal virtual lane dataset is
built in which only the lane regions are repainted while non-lane regions are
kept unchanged, maintaining the similar distribution of lanes in the wild. The
teacher model learns enhanced discriminative representation based on the
virtual data and serves as the guidance for a student model to imitate. In the
imitating learning step, through the scale-fusing distillation module, the
student network is encouraged to generate features that mimic the teacher model
both on the same scale and cross scales. Furthermore, the coupled adversarial
module builds the bridge to connect not only teacher and student models but
also virtual and real data, adjusting the imitating learning process
dynamically. Note that our method introduces no extra time cost during
inference and can be plug-and-play in various cutting-edge lane detection
networks. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the RIL framework
both on CULane and TuSimple for four modern lane detection methods. The code
and model will be available soon.

tissues. For example, the growth of a tumour can depend on or infiltrate into
the surrounding tissues. Due to the pathological nature of the lesions, it is
challenging to distinguish their boundaries in medical imaging. However, these
uncertain regions may contain diagnostic information. Therefore, the simple
binarization of lesions by traditional binary segmentation can result in the
loss of diagnostic information. In this work, we introduce the image matting
into the 3D scenes and use the alpha matte, i.e., a soft mask, to describe
lesions in a 3D medical image. The traditional soft mask acted as a training
trick to compensate for the easily mislabelled or under-labelled ambiguous
regions. In contrast, 3D matting uses soft segmentation to characterize the
uncertain regions more finely, which means that it retains more structural
information for subsequent diagnosis and treatment. The current study of image
matting methods in 3D is limited. To address this issue, we conduct a
comprehensive study of 3D matting, including both traditional and
deep-learning-based methods. We adapt four state-of-the-art 2D image matting
algorithms to 3D scenes and further customize the methods for CT images to
calibrate the alpha matte with the radiodensity. Moreover, we propose the first
end-to-end deep 3D matting network and implement a solid 3D medical image
matting benchmark. Its efficient counterparts are also proposed to achieve a
good performance-computation balance. Furthermore, there is no high-quality
annotated dataset related to 3D matting, slowing down the development of
data-driven deep-learning-based methods. To address this issue, we construct
the first 3D medical matting dataset. The validity of the dataset was verified
through clinicians' assessments and downstream experiments.

analysis of sparse tensors, which can represent diverse datasets involving
discrete-valued variables. Given a sparse tensor, producing a low-rank CP
decomposition is computation and memory intensive, typically involving several
large, structured linear least-squares problems. Several recent works have
provided randomized sketching methods to reduce the cost of these least squares
problems, along with shared-memory prototypes of their algorithms.
Unfortunately, these prototypes are slow compared to optimized non-randomized
tensor decomposition. Furthermore, they do not scale to tensors that exceed the
memory capacity of a single shared-memory device.
  We extend randomized algorithms for CP decomposition to the
distributed-memory setting and provide high-performance implementations
competitive with state-of-the-art non-randomized libraries. These algorithms
sample from a distribution of statistical leverage scores to reduce the cost of
repeated least squares solves required in the tensor decomposition. We show how
to efficiently sample from an approximate leverage score distribution of the
left-hand side of each linear system when the CP factor matrices are
distributed by block rows among processors. In contrast to earlier works that
only communicate dense factor matrices in a Cartesian topology between
processors, we use sampling to avoid expensive reduce-scatter collectives by
communicating selected nonzeros from the sparse tensor and a small subset of
factor matrix rows. On the CPU partition of the NERSC Cray EX supercomputer
Perlmutter, our high-performance implementations require just seconds to
compute low-rank approximations of real-world sparse tensors with billions of
nonzeros.

many applications, e.g., in portfolio optimization, assortment planning, and

requirements entails the formulation of functional constrained optimization
with either convex or nonconvex objectives. In this paper, we focus on
projection-free methods that can generate a sparse trajectory for solving these
challenging functional constrained optimization problems. Specifically, for the
convex setting, we propose a Level Conditional Gradient (LCG) method, which
leverages a level-set framework to update the approximation of the optimal
value and an inner conditional gradient oracle (CGO) for solving mini-max
subproblems. We show that the method achieves
$\mathcal{O}\big(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\big)$ iteration
complexity for solving both smooth and nonsmooth cases without dependency on a
possibly large size of optimal dual Lagrange multiplier. For the nonconvex

Direct Nonconvex Conditional Gradient (DNCG) method. The first approach taps
into the advantage of LCG by transforming the problem into a series of convex
subproblems and exhibits an
$\mathcal{O}\big(\frac{1}{\epsilon^3}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\big)$ iteration

performance. In this paper, we present model compression algorithms for both
non-retraining and retraining conditions. In the first case where retraining of
the model is not feasible due to lack of access to the original data or absence
of necessary compute resources while only having access to off-the-shelf
models, we propose the Bin & Quant algorithm for compression of the deep

in 13x compression of the speech command and control model and 7x compression
of the DeepSpeech2 models. In the second case when the models can be retrained

propose our novel gradient-weighted k-means clustering algorithm (GWK). This
method uses the gradients in identifying the important weight values in a given
cluster and nudges the centroid towards those values, thereby giving importance
to sensitive weights. Our method effectively combines product quantization with

not invariant to logit scaling, increasing the effective weight norm will make
the loss approach zero and its gradient vanish while the effective margin is
not adequately maximized. On typical DNNs, we demonstrate that, if not properly
regularized, the standard training does not learn large effective margins and
leads to adversarial vulnerability. To maximize the effective margins and learn
a robust DNN, we propose to regularize the effective weight norm during
training. Our empirical study on feedforward DNNs demonstrates that the
proposed effective margin regularization (EMR) learns large effective margins
and boosts the adversarial robustness in both standard and adversarial
training. On large-scale models, we show that EMR outperforms basic adversarial
training, TRADES and two regularization baselines with substantial improvement.
Moreover, when combined with several strong adversarial defense methods (MART

the key issues of random walks with wide applications in natural, social, and
engineered systems. Addressing the full distribution of cover times for random
walk on complex structures has been a long-standing challenge and has attracted
persistent efforts. Yet, the known results are essentially limited to
homogeneous systems, where different sites are on an equal footing and have
identical or close mean first-passage times, such as random walks on a torus.
In contrast, realistic random walks are prevailingly heterogeneous with
diversified mean first-passage times. Does a universal distribution still
exist? Here, by considering the most general situations, we uncover a
generalized rescaling relation for the cover time, exploiting the diversified
mean first-passage times that have not been accounted for before. This allows
us to concretely establish a universal distribution of the rescaled cover times
for heterogeneous random walks, which turns out to be the Gumbel universality
class that is ubiquitous for a large family of extreme value statistics. Our
analysis is based on the transfer matrix framework, which is generic that
besides heterogeneity, it is also robust against biased protocols, directed
links, and self-connecting loops. The finding is corroborated with extensive
numerical simulations of diverse heterogeneous non-compact random walks on both

filtration. I introduce the concept of a persistence diagram bundle, which is
the space of PDs associated with a fibered filtration function (a set $\{f_t:
\mathcal{K}^t \to \mathbb{R}\}_{t \in \mathcal{T}}$ of filtrations
parameterized by a topological space $\mathcal{T}$). Special cases include
vineyards, the persistent homology transform, and fibered barcodes of
multiparameter persistence modules. I prove that if $\mathcal{T}$ is a compact
$n$-dimensional manifold, then for generic fibered filtration functions,
$\mathcal{T}$ is stratified such that within each $n$-dimensional stratum $S$,
there is a single PD ""template"" (a list of birth and death simplices) that can
be used to obtain $PD(f_t)$ for any $t \in S$. I also show that not every local
section can be extended to a global section. Consequently, the points in the
PDs do not typically trace out separate manifolds as $t \in \mathcal{T}$
varies; this is unlike a vineyard, in which the points in the PDs trace out

  Calibration","Accepted at ACM MM2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Instance-dependent label noise is realistic but rather challenging, where the
label-corruption process depends on instances directly. It causes a severe
distribution shift between the distributions of training and test data, which
impairs the generalization of trained models. Prior works put great effort into
tackling the issue. Unfortunately, these works always highly rely on strong
assumptions or remain heuristic without theoretical guarantees. In this paper,
to address the distribution shift in learning with instance-dependent label
noise, a dynamic distribution-calibration strategy is adopted. Specifically, we
hypothesize that, before training data are corrupted by label noise, each class
conforms to a multivariate Gaussian distribution at the feature level. Label
noise produces outliers to shift the Gaussian distribution. During training, to
calibrate the shifted distribution, we propose two methods based on the mean
and covariance of multivariate Gaussian distribution respectively. The
mean-based method works in a recursive dimension-reduction manner for robust
mean estimation, which is theoretically guaranteed to train a high-quality
model against label noise. The covariance-based method works in a distribution
disturbance manner, which is experimentally verified to improve the model
robustness. We demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our methods on
datasets with synthetic label noise and real-world unknown noise.

significant influence on regional and global climates, as well as the
identification of ship movements. Characterizing these phenomena requires a
fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind drop production.
The interscale nature of these mechanisms also influences the development of
models that enable cost-effective computation of large-scale waves. Interscale
locality implies the universality of small scales and the suitability of
generic subgrid-scale (SGS) models, while interscale nonlocality points to the
potential dependence of the small scales on larger-scale geometry
configurations and the corresponding need for tailored SGS models instead. A
recently developed analysis toolkit combining theoretical population balance
models, multiphase numerical simulations, and structure-tracking algorithms is
used to probe the nature of drop production and its corresponding interscale
mass-transfer characteristics above the surface of breaking waves. The results
from the application of this toolkit suggest that while drop breakup is a
somewhat scale-nonlocal process, its interscale transfer signature suggests
that it is likely capillary-dominated and thus sensitive not to the specific
nature of large-scale wave breaking, but rather to the specific geometry of the
parent drops.

distributed attention points with specific coordinate values is first created

important setting: can we train one model that can represent multiple scenes,
with 360$^\circ $ insufficient views and RGB-D images? We refer insufficient
views to few extremely sparse and almost non-overlapping views. To deal with
it, X-NeRF, a fully explicit approach which learns a general scene completion
process instead of a coordinate-based mapping, is proposed. Given a few
insufficient RGB-D input views, X-NeRF first transforms them to a sparse point
cloud tensor and then applies a 3D sparse generative Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) to complete it to an explicit radiance field whose volumetric
rendering can be conducted fast without running networks during inference. To
avoid overfitting, besides common rendering loss, we apply perceptual loss as
well as view augmentation through random rotation on point clouds. The proposed
methodology significantly out-performs previous implicit methods in our

characterize the clustering of discrete (point) datasets. Here we extend it to
the point-field cross-correlation analysis. It combines $k$NN measurements of
the point data set with measurements of the field smoothed on many scales. The
resulting statistics are sensitive to all orders in the joint clustering of the
points and the field. We demonstrate that this approach, unlike the 2-pt
cross-correlation, can measure the statistical dependence of two datasets even
when there are no linear (Gaussian) correlations. We further demonstrate that
this framework is far more effective than the two-point function in detecting
cross-correlations when the continuous field is contaminated by high levels of
noise. For a particularly high level of noise, the cross-correlations between
halos and the underlying matter field in a cosmological simulation, between
$10h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ and $30h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, is detected at $>5\sigma$
significance using the technique presented here, when the two-point
cross-correlation significance is $\sim 1\sigma$. Finally, we show that the
$k$NN cross-correlations of halos and the matter field can be well-modeled on
quasilinear scales by the Hybrid Effective Field Theory (HEFT) framework, with
the same set of bias parameters as are used for the two-point

measure this inconsistency and reveal that TID can indicate BN's performance,
supported by extensive experiments, including image classification, neural
machine translation, language modeling, sequence labeling, and text

than LN when TID keeps small through training. To suppress the explosion of
TID, we propose Regularized BN (RBN) that adds a simple regularization term to
narrow the gap between batch statistics and population statistics of BN. RBN
improves the performance of BN consistently and outperforms or is on par with

interest to improve a machine learning model's performance, especially when the
number of samples from at least one of the datasets is small. However, a
potential challenge in such cases is that the features from these datasets are
not identical, even though there are some commonly shared features among the
datasets. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Combine
datasets based on Imputation (ComImp). In addition, we propose a variant of
ComImp that uses Principle Component Analysis (PCA), PCA-ComImp in order to
reduce dimension before combining datasets. This is useful when the datasets
have a large number of features that are not shared between them. Furthermore,
our framework can also be utilized for data preprocessing by imputing missing
data, i.e., filling in the missing entries while combining different datasets.
To illustrate the power of the proposed methods and their potential usages, we
conduct experiments for various tasks: regression, classification, and for
different data types: tabular data, time series data, when the datasets to be
combined have missing data. We also investigate how the devised methods can be
used with transfer learning to provide even further model training improvement.
Our results indicate that the proposed methods are somewhat similar to transfer
learning in that the merge can significantly improve the accuracy of a
prediction model on smaller datasets. In addition, the methods can boost
performance by a significant margin when combining small datasets together and
can provide extra improvement when being used with transfer learning.

fine-tuned Segmentation Network (F-SegNet). Skin lesion localization helps to
reduce the unnecessary calculation of whole images for segmentation. The

trained by solving the quadratic optimization problem. To simplify the tuning

the ""replicable"" outcomes for which the effect of unintended pregnancy is
negative (or, positive) in both subgroups. Following the idea of non-random
cross-screening, the data will be split according to whether the woman is

decide how to plan the analysis for the second team's data. In addition to the

inter-rater variability with the expense of decreasing dataset size increased
the model performance. Furthermore, models trained from data annotated with

that the resulting NN-based planner inherits the interpretability and

serves as a discrete ""memory"", which is necessary for satisfying temporal logic

in its magnetic hysteresis curve at 2 K. The observed jumps have a stochastic
character with respect to their magnitude and the critical field of occurrence,
and the jumps do not show any temporal effect. The jump size distribution
follows a power law variation indicating the scale invariance nature of the
jumps. We have invoked a simple two-dimensional random bond Ising-type spin
system to model the dynamics. Our computational work can qualitatively
reproduce the jumps and their scale invariant character. It also elucidates
that the flipping of antiferromagnetically coupled Dy and Fe clusters is
responsible for the observed discrete avalanche-like features in the hysteresis
loop. These characteristics indicate that the present phenomenon can be well
described within the realm of self-organized criticality

2-qubit operations can only be performed between the qubits closest to each
other in a graph structure. So a quantum circuit must undergo a transformation
to the graph before it can be implemented. In this paper, we study the
optimization of the CNOT circuits on some noisy intermediate-scale
quantum(NISQ) devices. Compared with previous works, we decompose it into two
sub-problems: optimization with a given initial qubit distribution and
optimization without limitations of initial qubit distribution. We find that
most of the previous researches focused on the first sub-problem, and ignored
the influence of different distribution of qubits in the same topology
structure on the optimization results. In this paper, We take both sub-problems
into account and give some new optimization algorithms. In short, our method is
divided into two steps: matrix optimization and routing optimization. We
implement matrix optimization with the algorithm in [XZL+20] and put forward a
new heuristic algorithm with MILP method which can solve the second step. We
implement our algorithm on IBM20 and some other NISQ devices, the results are
better than most other methods in our experiment.

the performance of the student model has been increasingly popular in various
machine learning domains, and meta-learning is no exception; a recent discovery
shows that utilizing task-wise target models can significantly boost the
generalization performance. However, obtaining a target model for each task can
be highly expensive, especially when the number of tasks for meta-learning is
large. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, coined
Self-improving Momentum Target (SiMT). SiMT generates the target model by
adapting from the temporal ensemble of the meta-learner, i.e., the momentum
network. This momentum network and its task-specific adaptations enjoy a
favorable generalization performance, enabling self-improving of the
meta-learner through knowledge distillation. Moreover, we found that perturbing
parameters of the meta-learner, e.g., dropout, further stabilize this
self-improving process by preventing fast convergence of the distillation loss
during meta-training. Our experimental results demonstrate that SiMT brings a
significant performance gain when combined with a wide range of meta-learning
methods under various applications, including few-shot regression, few-shot
classification, and meta-reinforcement learning. Code is available at

efforts improve the performance of traditional ad-hoc retrieval models, legal
case retrieval is still challenging since queries are legal cases, which
contain hundreds of tokens. Legal cases are much longer and more complicated
than keywords queries. Apart from that, the definition of legal relevance is
beyond the general definition. In addition to general topical relevance, the
relevant cases also involve similar situations and legal elements, which can
support the judgment of the current case. In this paper, we propose an
interaction-focused network for legal case retrieval with a multi-view
contrastive learning objective. The contrastive learning views, including
case-view and element-view, aim to overcome the above challenges. The case-view
contrastive learning minimizes the hidden space distance between relevant legal
case representations produced by a pre-trained language model (PLM) encoder.
The element-view builds positive and negative instances by changing legal
elements of cases to help the network better compute legal relevance. To
achieve this, we employ a legal element knowledge-aware indicator to detect
legal elements of cases. We conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark of
relevant case retrieval. Evaluation results indicate our proposed method
obtains significant improvement over the existing methods.

class of studies investigate a subject's ability to perform a task as a
function of the stimulus intensity, meaning the amount or clarity of the
information supplied for the task. The relationship between the performance and
intensity is represented by a psychometric function. Such experiments routinely
apply adaptive designs, which use both previous intensities and performance to
assign stimulus intensities, the strategy being to sample intensities where the
information about the psychometric function is maximised. Similar schemes are
often applied in drug trials to assign doses dynamically using doses and
responses from earlier observations. The present paper investigates the
influence of adaptation on statistical inference about the psychometric
function focusing on estimation, considering both parametric and non-parametric
estimation under both fixed and adaptive designs in schemes encompassing within
subject independence as well as dependence through random effects. We study the
scenarios analytically, focussing on a latent class model to derive results
under random effects, and numerically through a simulation study. We show that
while the asymptotic properties of estimators are preserved under adaptation,
the adaptive nature of the design introduces small-sample bias, in particular
in the slope parameter of the psychometric function. We argue that this poses a
dilemma for a study applying an adaptive design in the form of a trade-off
between more efficient sampling and the need to increase the number of samples

chiral currents in spacetime with boundaries. Remarkably, the chiral current is
not invariant under the gauge transformation of axial vector fields. As a
result, more potential terms appear, and the chiral current becomes larger than
the electric current near the boundary. This paper investigates the anomalous
chiral current in AdS/BCFT. We find that the minimal holographic model of the
axial vector field cannot produce the expected chiral current. To resolve this
problem, we propose adding a suitable boundary action. Furthermore, we notice a
similar situation for holographic condensation. Finally, we obtain the shape
dependence of holographic chiral current and verify that it agrees with the
field-theoretical result.

the variability of radio emission is important for determining the OHM galaxies

individual galaxies in both samples, flux density variations reach 30-50%.

their sensitivity to the initialization process often renders them notoriously
hard to train. Recent works have shed light on such phenomena analyzing when
exploding or vanishing gradients may occur, either of which is detrimental for
training dynamics. In this paper, we point to a formal connection between RNNs
and chaotic dynamical systems and prove a qualitatively stronger phenomenon
about RNNs than what exploding gradients seem to suggest. Our main result
proves that under standard initialization (e.g., He, Xavier etc.), RNNs will
exhibit \textit{Li-Yorke chaos} with \textit{constant} probability
\textit{independent} of the network's width. This explains the experimentally
observed phenomenon of \textit{scrambling}, under which trajectories of nearby
points may appear to be arbitrarily close during some timesteps, yet will be
far away in future timesteps. In stark contrast to their feedforward
counterparts, we show that chaotic behavior in RNNs is preserved under small
perturbations and that their expressive power remains exponential in the number
of feedback iterations. Our technical arguments rely on viewing RNNs as random
walks under non-linear activations, and studying the existence of certain types
of higher-order fixed points called \textit{periodic points} that lead to phase
transitions from order to chaos.

A universally accepted definition of what a vortex is has not yet
been reached. Therefore, we lack an unambiguous and rigorous method for the
identification of vortices in fluid flows. Such a method would be necessary to
conduct robust statistical studies on vortices in highly dynamical and
turbulent systems, such as the solar atmosphere. Aims. We aim to develop an
innovative and robust automated methodology for the identification of vortices
based on local and global characteristics of the flow. Moreover, the use of a
threshold that could potentially prevent the detection of weak vortices in the
identification process should be avoided. Methods. We present a new method that
combines the rigor of mathematical criteria with the global perspective of
morphological techniques. The core of the method consists in the estimation of
the center of rotation for every point of the flow that presents some degree of
curvature in its neighborhood. For that, we employ the Rortex criterion and
combine it with morphological considerations of the velocity field. We then
identify coherent vortical structures by clusters of estimated centers of
rotation. Results. We demonstrate that the Rortex is a more reliable criterion
than are the swirling strength and the vorticity for the extraction of physical
information from vortical flows, because it measures the rigid-body rotational
part of the flow alone and is not biased by the presence of pure or intrinsic
shears. We show that the method performs well on a simplistic test case
composed of two Lamb-Oseen vortices. We combine the proposed method with a
state of the art clustering algorithm to build an automated vortex
identification algorithm. (Abridged)

An attacker may change the control configurations or various setpoints of the

ability to manipulate individual PV bus measurements to avoid detection. We
show that even in such a scenario, with just the aggregated measurements (that
the attacker cannot manipulate), machine learning (ML) techniques are able to
detect the attack in a fast and accurate manner. We use a standard radial

them to make predictions is a benchmark of biological resilience, and underpins
a plethora of adaptive responses in the living hierarchy, spanning prey animal
species anticipating the arrival of predators, to epigenetic systems in
microorganisms learning environmental correlations. Given the ubiquitous and
essential presence of learning behaviours in the biosphere, we aimed to explore
whether simple, non-living dissipative structures could also exhibit
associative learning. Inspired by previous modeling of associative learning in
chemical networks, we simulated simple systems composed of long and short term
memory chemical species that could encode the presence or absence of temporal
correlations between two external species. The ability to learn this
association was implemented in Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion spots, emergent
chemical patterns that exhibit self-replication and homeostasis. With the novel

A predictor consisting of a bank of user-specific predictive modules is

over an air interface can be parallelized. Therefore, DT-ZFP not only
effectively combats channel aging but also avoids the inefficient Stop-and-Wait
mechanism of the canonical ZFP in CFmMIMO.

Deep Correspondence Learning Network for direct 6D object pose estimation,

Disengagement and Alignment (FDA) modules to establish, in the feature space,
partial-to-partial correspondence and complete-to-complete one for partial
object observation and its complete CAD model, respectively, which result in
aggregated pose and match feature pairs from two coordinate systems; these two
FDA modules thus bring complementary advantages. The match feature pairs are
used to learn confidence scores for measuring the qualities of deep
correspondence, while the pose feature pairs are weighted by confidence scores
for direct object pose regression. A confidence-based pose refinement network
is also proposed to further improve pose precision in an iterative manner.
Extensive experiments show that DCL-Net outperforms existing methods on three
benchmarking datasets, including YCB-Video, LineMOD, and Oclussion-LineMOD;

with or without linear precoding to estimate challenging doubly-dispersive
channels. A recently proposed modulation scheme using orthogonal precoding is
orthogonal time-frequency and space modulation (OTFS). In OTFS, pilot and data
symbols are placed in delay-Doppler (DD) domain and are jointly precoded to the
time-frequency (TF) domain. On the one hand, such orthogonal precoding
increases the achievable channel estimation accuracy and enables high TF
diversity at the receiver. On the other hand, it introduces leakage effects
which requires extensive leakage suppression when the piloting is jointly
precoded with the data. To avoid this, we propose to precode the data symbols
only, place pilot symbols without precoding into the TF domain, and estimate
the channel coefficients by interpolating smooth functions from the pilot
samples. Furthermore, we present a piloting scheme enabling a smooth control of
the number and position of the pilot symbols. Our numerical results suggest
that the proposed scheme provides accurate channel estimation with reduced
signaling overhead compared to standard estimators using Wiener filtering in
the discrete DD domain.

  Audio-visual Event Localization",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Audio-visual event localization has attracted much attention in recent years.
Most existing methods are often limited to independently encoding and
classifying each video segment separated from the full video (which can be
regarded as the segment-level representations of events). However, they ignore
the semantic consistency of the event within the same full video (which can be
considered as the video-level representations of events). In contrast to
existing methods, we propose a novel video-level semantic consistency guidance
network for the AVE task. Specifically, we propose an event semantic
consistency modeling (ESCM) module to explore the video-level semantic
consistency of events. It consists of two components: cross-modal event
representation extractor (CERE) and intra-modal semantic consistency enhancer
(ISCE). CERE is proposed to obtain the event semantic representation at the
video level including, audio and visual modules. Furthermore, ISCE takes the
video-level event semantic representation as the prior knowledge to guide the
model to focus on the semantic continuity of the event within each modality.
Moreover, we propose a new negative pair filter loss to encourage the network
to filter out the irrelevant segment pairs and a new smooth loss to further
increase the gap between different categories of events under the
weakly-supervised setting. We perform extensive experiments on the public AVE
dataset and outperform the state-of-the-art methods in both fully and weakly
supervised settings, thus verifying the effectiveness of our method.

information search, the data features of different modalities cannot be
compared directly, so the semantic gap between different modalities is a key
problem that needs to be solved. To address the above problems, this paper
proposes a novel Feature Fusion based Adversarial Cross-modal Retrieval method
(FFACR) to achieve text-to-video matching, ranking and searching. The proposed
method uses the framework of adversarial learning to construct a video
multimodal feature fusion network and a feature mapping network as generator, a
modality discrimination network as discriminator. Multi-modal features of
videos are obtained by the feature fusion network. The feature mapping network
projects multi-modal features into the same semantic space based on semantics
and similarity. The modality discrimination network is responsible for
determining the original modality of features. Generator and discriminator are
trained alternately based on adversarial learning, so that the data obtained by
the feature mapping network is semantically consistent with the original data
and the modal features are eliminated, and finally the similarity is used to
rank and obtain the search results in the semantic space. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method performs better in text-to-video search
than other existing methods, and validate the effectiveness of the method on
the self-built datasets of technology videos.

spatial derivative terms into the gravitational action, which breaks the parity
symmetry at gravitational sector. A lot of parity-violating scalar-tensor
theories can be mapped to the spatial covariant framework by imposing the
unitary gauge. This provides us with a general framework for exploring the
parity-violating effects in primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). The main
purpose of this paper is to investigate the polarization of PGWs in the spatial
covariant gravities and their possible observational effects. To this end, we
first construct the approximate analytical solution to the mode function of the
PGWs during the slow-roll inflation by using the uniform asymptotic
approximation. With the approximate solution, we calculate explicitly the power
spectrum and the corresponding circular polarization of the PGWs analytically.
It is shown that the new contributions to power spectrum from spatial covariant
gravities contain two parts, one from the parity-preserving terms and the other
from the parity-violating terms. While the parity-preserving terms can only
affect the overall amplitudes of PGWs, the parity-violating terms induce
nonzero circular polarization of PGWs, i.e., the left-hand and right-hand
polarization modes of GWs have different amplitudes. The observational
implications of this nonzero circular polarization is also briefly discussed.

preconditions the gradient descent with the inverse of the Fisher Information
Matrix (FIM). Although NGD provides an efficient preconditioner, it is not
practicable due to the expensive computation required when inverting the FIM.
This paper proposes a new NGD variant algorithm named Component-Wise Natural
Gradient Descent (CW-NGD). CW-NGD is composed of 2 steps. Similar to several
existing works, the first step is to consider the FIM matrix as a
block-diagonal matrix whose diagonal blocks correspond to the FIM of each
layer's weights. In the second step, unique to CW-NGD, we analyze the layer's
structure and further decompose the layer's FIM into smaller segments whose
derivatives are approximately independent. As a result, individual layers' FIMs
are approximated in a block-diagonal form that trivially supports the
inversion. The segment decomposition strategy is varied by layer structure.
Specifically, we analyze the dense and convolutional layers and design their
decomposition strategies appropriately. In an experiment of training a network
containing these 2 types of layers, we empirically prove that CW-NGD requires
fewer iterations to converge compared to the state-of-the-art first-order and

spin-orbit coupling in the Mott insulating phase, which favors a triplet
resonance valence bond spin liquid state. Hole doping leads to partial
occupation of a flat band and to triplet superconductivity. The order parameter
is highly sensitive to the doping level and the interaction parameters, with
$p+ip$, $f$ and $p+f$ superconductivity found, as the flat band leads to
instabilities in multiple channels. Typically, first order transitions separate
different superconducting phases, but a second order transition separates two
time reversal symmetry breaking $p+ip$ phases with different Chern numbers
($\nu=0$ and 1). The Majorana edge modes in the topological ($\nu=1$)
superconductor are almost localized due to the strong electronic correlations
in a system with a flat band at the Fermi level. This suggests that these modes
could be useful for topological quantum computing. The `hybrid' $p+f$ state
does not require two phase transitions as temperature is lowered. This is
because the symmetry of the model is lowered in the $p$-wave phase, allowing
arbitrary admixtures of $f$-wave basis functions as overtones. We show that the
multiple sites per unit cell of the DHL, and hence multiple bands near the
Fermi energy, lead to very different nodal structures in real and reciprocal

CD-FSL without any target data during model training, the huge domain gap makes
it still hard for existing CD-FSL methods to achieve very satisfactory results.
Alternatively, learning CD-FSL models with few labeled target domain data which
is more realistic and promising is advocated in previous
work~\cite{fu2021meta}. Thus, in this paper, we stick to this setting and
technically contribute a novel Multi-Expert Domain Decompositional Network
(ME-D2N). Concretely, to solve the data imbalance problem between the source
data with sufficient examples and the auxiliary target data with limited
examples, we build our model under the umbrella of multi-expert learning. Two
teacher models which can be considered to be experts in their corresponding
domain are first trained on the source and the auxiliary target sets,
respectively. Then, the knowledge distillation technique is introduced to
transfer the knowledge from two teachers to a unified student model. Taking a
step further, to help our student model learn knowledge from different domain
teachers simultaneously, we further present a novel domain decomposition module
that learns to decompose the student model into two domain-related sub parts.
This is achieved by a novel domain-specific gate that learns to assign each

set on non-Euclidean momentum space. Quantitatively, the coordinate
noncommutativity translates to momentum space curvature in the dual
description, allowing for an analogous transfer of constraints from the
literature. Finally, we find a formulation of quantum mechanics which proves
consistent on the arbitrarily curved cotangent bundle. Along these lines, we
show that the harmonic oscillator can not be used as a means to distinguish
between curvature in position and momentum space, thereby providing an explicit
instantiation of Born reciprocity in the context of curved spaces.

studied in the forms of the inner disc temperature ($T_{\rm in}$), photon index

and luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$). We studied various correlations among different
spectral parameters to understand the accretion process on a global scale. In
the thermal soft states (TSS), we find most of the sources followed $F_{\rm
disc} \propto T_{\rm in}^4$ relation. A `V'-shaped correlation is found between
$\Gamma$ and total luminosity ($L_{\rm tot}$) in the hard Comptonized state
(HCS). The Comptonized luminosity is observed to be correlated with the disc
luminosity in the HCS and TSS. No notable correlation is observed in the
intermediate state (IMS). The evolution of the inner disc radius ($R_{\rm in}$)
is unclear in the HCS and IMS. We also discuss how the hot electron temperature
changes with other spectral parameters. We observe that the iron line flux
correlates with disc and Comptonized fluxes. The strength of the reprocessed

  report","2022 ApJ 941 5","10.3847/1538-4357/ac9d8c",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Cluster galaxies exhibit substantially lower star formation rates than field
galaxies today, but it is conceivable that clusters were sites of more active
star formation in the early universe. Herein, we present an interpretation of
the star formation history (SFH) of group/cluster galaxies based on the
large-scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, Horizon-AGN. We find that
massive galaxies in general have small values of e-folding timescales of star
formation decay (i.e., ``mass quenching'') regardless of their environment,
whilst low-mass galaxies exhibit prominent environmental dependence. In massive
host halos (i.e., clusters), the e-folding timescales of low-mass galaxies are
further decreased if they reside in such halos for a longer period of time.
This ``environmental quenching'' trend is consistent with the theoretical
expectation from ram pressure stripping. Furthermore, we define a ``transition
epoch'' as where cluster galaxies become less star-forming than field galaxies.
The transition epoch of group/cluster galaxies varies according to their
stellar and host cluster halo masses. Low-mass galaxies in massive clusters
show the earliest transition epoch of $\sim 7.6$ Gyr ago in lookback time.
However, it decreases to $\sim 5.2$ Gyr for massive galaxies in low-mass
clusters. Based on our findings, we can describe cluster galaxy's SFH with
regard to the cluster halo-to-stellar mass ratio.

molecules is fundamental to assess their emissive properties. In this context,
global harmonic models have been widely used to simulate vibronic spectra as
well as internal conversion rates and to predict photoluminescence quantum
yields. However, these simplified models suffer from the limitations that are
inherent to the harmonic approximation and can have a severe effect on the
calculated internal conversion rates. Therefore, the development of more
accurate semiclassical methods is highly desirable. Here, we introduce a
procedure for the calculation of nonradiative rates in the framework of the
time-dependent semi-classical Extended Thawed Gaussian Approximation (ETGA). We
systematically investigate the performance of the ETGA method by comparing it
to the the adiabatic and vertical harmonic method, which belong to the class of
widely used global harmonic models. Its performance is tested in potentials
that cannot be treated adequately by global harmonic models, beginning with
Morse potentials of varying anharmonicity followed by a double well potential.
The calculated radiative and nonradiative internal conversion rates are
compared to reference values based on exact quantum dynamics. We find that the
ETGA has the capability to predict internal conversion rates in anharmonic
systems with an appreciable energy gap, whereas the global harmonic models
prove to be insufficient.

sensitivity to word order and structural differences in given sentences. A
single similarity score further makes the comparison process hard to interpret.
Therefore, we here propose to combine sentence encoders with an alignment
component by representing each sentence as a list of predicate-argument spans
(where their span representations are derived from sentence encoders), and
decomposing the sentence-level meaning comparison into the alignment between
their spans for paraphrase identification tasks. Empirical results show that
the alignment component brings in both improved performance and
interpretability for various sentence encoders. After closer investigation, the
proposed approach indicates increased sensitivity to structural difference and
enhanced ability to distinguish non-paraphrases with high lexical overlap.

semi-coherent and incoherent patches on 1.5% mismatched InAs, to nearly
coherent on 0.8% mismatched GaSb. The semi-coherent portions of the interfaces
to InAs form by 60{\deg} misfit dislocations gliding on higher order {111}<110>

handle the time-linking constraints that are introduced in such markets,
existing works commonly make simplifying assumptions about the end-of-horizon
storage level. This work analyzes market properties under such assumptions, as
well as in their absence. We find that, although they ensure cost recovery for
all market participants, these assumptions generally lead to market
inefficiencies. Therefore we consider the design of markets with non-merchant

well as detailed proofs, we provide conditions under which market prices in
subsequent market horizons fail to reflect the value of stored energy. We show
that this problem is essential to address in order to preserve market
efficiency and cost recovery. Finally, we propose a method for restoring these
market properties in a perfect-foresight setting.

of quantum walks, which lies at the heart of their quantum information
applications, is the possibility for a parametric quantum speed-up in
propagation compared to classical random walks. In this work we study
propagation of quantum walks on percolation-generated two-dimensional random
lattices. In large-scale simulations of topological and trivial split-step
walks, we identify distinct pre-diffusive and diffusive behaviors at different
time scales. Importantly, we show that even arbitrarily weak concentrations of
randomly removed lattice sites give rise to a complete breakdown of the
superdiffusive quantum speed-up, reducing the motion to ordinary diffusion. By
increasing the randomness, quantum walks eventually stop spreading due to
Anderson localization. Near the localization threshold, we find that the
quantum walks become subdiffusive. The fragility of quantum speed-up implies
dramatic limitations for quantum information applications of quantum walks on
random geometries and graphs.

variations discovered by the Kepler mission. It is composed of a non-eclipsing
primary star at the bottom of the red giant branch on a 209-day orbit with a
K/G-type main-sequence inner eclipsing binary, orbiting in 15.3 days. This
system was noted for the large amplitude of its eclipse timing variations (4
hours), and the clear solar-like oscillations of the red-giant component,
including p-modes of degree up to l=3 and mixed l=1 modes. The system is a
single-lined spectroscopic triple. We perform a dynamical model by combining
the Kepler photometric data, eclipse timing variations, and radial-velocity
data obtained at Apache Point (ARCES) and Haute Provence (SOPHIE)
observatories. The dynamical mass of the red-giant is determined with a 2%
precision at 1.30 (+0.03,-0.02) solar mass. We perform asteroseismic modeling
based on the global seismic parameters and on the individual frequencies. Both
methods lead to a mass of the red giant that matches the dynamical mass within
the uncertainties. Asteroseismology also reveals the rotation rate of the core
(15 days), the envelope (150 days), and the inclination (75 deg) of the red
giant. Three different approaches lead to an age between 3.3 and 5.8 Gyr, which
highlights the difficulty of determining stellar ages despite the exceptional
wealth of available information. On short timescales, the inner binary exhibits
eclipses with varying depths during a 7.3-year long interval, and no eclipses
during the consecutive 11.9 years. This is why Kepler could detect its
eclipses, TESS will not, and the future ESA PLATO mission should. Over the long
term, the system owes its evolution to the evolution of its individual
components. It could end its current smooth evolution by merging by the end of
the red giant or the asymptotic giant branch of the primary star.

from a substellar companion, on the dust dynamics in a debris disk can be
investigated with spatially resolved observations.
  Methods. We numerically simulated the collisional evolution of narrow and
eccentric cold planetesimal belts around a star of spectral type A3V that are
secularly perturbed by a companion that orbits either closer to or farther from
the star than the belt. Based on the resulting spatial dust distributions, we
simulated spatially resolved maps of their surface brightness in the $K$, $N$,
and $Q$ bands and at wavelengths of 70$\mu$m and 1300$\mu$m.
  Results. Assuming a nearby debris disk seen face-on, we find that the
brightness distribution varies significantly with observing wavelength, for
example between the $N$ and $Q$ band. This can be explained by the varying
relative contribution of the emission of the smallest grains near the blowout
limit. The orbits of both the small grains that form the halo and the large
grains close to the parent belt precess due to the secular perturbations
induced by a companion orbiting inward of the belt. The halo, being composed of
older grains, trails the belt. The magnitude of the trailing decreases with
increasing perturber mass and hence with increasing strength of the
perturbation, a trend we recovered in synthetic maps of surface brightness by
fitting ellipses to lines of constant brightness. Systems with an outer
perturber do not show a uniform halo precession since the orbits of small
grains are strongly altered. We identified features of the brightness
distributions suitable for distinguishing between systems with a potentially
detectable inner or outer perturber, especially with a combined observation
with JWST/MIRI in the $Q$ band tracing small grain emission and with ALMA at mm
wavelengths tracing the position of the parent planetesimal belt.

studied over the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). In the considered model, a vehicle
shares massive amount of visual data perceived by its visual sensors to assist
other vehicles in making driving decisions. However, it is hard to maintain a
high reliable visual data transmission due to the limited spectrum resources.
To tackle this problem, a semantic communication approach is introduced to
reduce the transmission data amount while ensuring the semantic-level accuracy.
Particularly, an image segmentation semantic communication (ISSC) system is
proposed, which can extract the semantic features from the perceived images and
transmit the features to the receiving vehicle that reconstructs the image
segmentations. The ISSC system consists of an encoder and a decoder at the
transmitter and the receiver, respectively. To accurately extract the image
semantic features, the ISSC system encoder employs a Swin Transformer based
multi-scale semantic feature extractor. Then, to resist the wireless noise and
reconstruct the image segmentation, a semantic feature decoder and a
reconstructor are designed at the receiver. Simulation results show that the
proposed ISSC system can reconstruct the image segmentation accurately with a
high compression ratio, and can achieve robust transmission performance against
channel noise, especially at the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In terms of

the qubit and the field is responsible for bounds on the gate fidelity, but
also for a nontrivial energy balance recently observed in a superconducting

heterodyne detection and then post-selected over the outcomes of a final

model the joint system dynamics with a collision model, gaining access to the

the conditional Husimi-Q function. The latter grants access to all the field's

the MA. In the case of stochastic channels, the expected value of an upper
bound on the maximum channel gain of the MA in the receive region is derived
for different numbers of channel paths. Moreover, our results reveal that
higher performance gains by the MA over the FPA can be acquired when the number
of channel paths increases due to more pronounced small-scale fading effects in

considerable performance gains over the conventional FPA, and even achieve
comparable performance to the single-input multiple-output beamforming system.

any reasonable measure of reciprocity should satisfy. Second, we propose
HyperRec, a principled measure of hypergraph reciprocity that satisfies all the

of trajectories. This allows us to recast the task of model reduction as a
variational problem that can be tackled using standard numerical optimisation
approaches. In addition we derive general expressions for the propensities of a
reduced system that generalise those found using classical methods. We show
that the Kullback-Leibler divergence is a useful metric to assess model

Such a module, which we call a {\em concurrent verifier} (CV), can give a

emotional state of users, allowing for a closer interaction between humans and
autonomous systems. Unfortunately, as the images naturally integrate some
demographic information, such as apparent age, gender, and race of the subject,
these systems are prone to demographic bias issues. In recent years, machine
learning-based models have become the most popular approach to FER. These
models require training on large datasets of facial expression images, and
their generalization capabilities are strongly related to the characteristics
of the dataset. In publicly available FER datasets, apparent gender
representation is usually mostly balanced, but their representation in the
individual label is not, embedding social stereotypes into the datasets and
generating a potential for harm. Although this type of bias has been overlooked
so far, it is important to understand the impact it may have in the context of
FER. To do so, we use a popular FER dataset, FER+, to generate derivative
datasets with different amounts of stereotypical bias by altering the gender
proportions of certain labels. We then proceed to measure the discrepancy
between the performance of the models trained on these datasets for the
apparent gender groups. We observe a discrepancy in the recognition of certain
emotions between genders of up to $29 \%$ under the worst bias conditions. Our
results also suggest a safety range for stereotypical bias in a dataset that
does not appear to produce stereotypical bias in the resulting model. Our
findings support the need for a thorough bias analysis of public datasets in
problems like FER, where a global balance of demographic representation can
still hide other types of bias that harm certain demographic groups.

model of distributed computing where nodes have access to two fundamentally
different communication modes. In this problem nodes have to compute small

local network, which typically offers the majority of the throughput. Recent
work has shown that using the $\mathsf{HYBRID}$ model admits a significant
speed-up compared to what would be possible if either communication mode were

the computation of routing schemes still takes polynomial rounds in the

graph to unit-disc-graphs and solve the problem deterministically with running
time $O(|\mathcal H|^2 \!+\! \log n)$, label size $O(\log n)$, and size of
routing tables $O(|\mathcal H|^2 \!\cdot\! \log n)$ where $|\mathcal H|$ is the
number of ``radio holes'' in the network. Our work builds on recent work by Coy

against counterfeiting, which gains its popularity in recent years. CDP
attracts the anti-counterfeiting industry due to its numerous benefits in
comparison to alternative protection techniques. Besides its attractiveness,
there is an essential gap in the fundamental analysis of CDP authentication
performance in large-scale industrial applications. It concerns variability of
CDP parameters under different production conditions that include a type of
printer, substrate, printing resolution, etc. Since digital off-set printing
represents great flexibility in terms of product personalized in comparison
with traditional off-set printing, it looks very interesting to address the
above concerns for digital off-set printers that are used by several companies
for the CDP protection of physical objects. In this paper, we thoroughly
investigate certain factors impacting CDP. The experimental results obtained
during our study reveal some previously unknown results and raise new and even
more challenging questions. The results prove that it is a matter of great
importance to choose carefully the substrate or printer for CDP production.
This paper presents a new dataset produced by two industrial HP Indigo
printers. The similarity between printed CDP and the digital templates, from
which they have been produced, is chosen as a simple measure in our study. We
found several particularities that might be of interest for large-scale
industrial applications.

reason with eigenworlds (i.e., generic representatives of worlds) in an

capture the semantics of the object-logic. Essentially, one has a calculus of

reductive logic (as opposed to the more traditional paradigm of deductive

equivalence of reduction in the sequent calculus for the object-logic and in
the validity calculus. Rather than study the technique in general, we
illustrate it for the logic of Bunched Implications (BI), thus IPL and MILL

intuitionistic propositional logic and multiplicative intuitionistic linear

convergence (AC) stability criteria. The transients may be of long duration,
persisting long after eigenvalues imply they should have decayed, and span
orders of magnitude. They occur both for causal and noncausal learning. The

the $\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ magnetic matrix elements $B_{nm}(\vec x ) =-B_{mn} (\vec

that the analysis of their large deviations properties and the construction of

We explain the parameter degeneracies found when fitting cosmic microwave

addition of supernovae data, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and
redshift-space distortions (RSD). In particular, care must be taken when

tensions between low-redshift measurements of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$, or
weak-lensing, $S_8$, and the values inferred from CMB data. However these
tensions return when we include constraints from supernova and BAO-RSD

possible to relax both the Hubble and weak-lensing tensions simultaneously, the
reduction in these tensions is modest (reduced to less slightly than $4\sigma$

a VQ-VAE based face anti-spoofing algorithm, trained on the Replay Attack and
the Spoof in the Wild (SiW) databases, and analysed for bias on the SiW and
Racial Faces in the Wild (RFW), databases. The results demonstrate that race
bias is not necessarily the result of different mean response values among the
various populations. Instead, it can be better understood as the combined
effect of several possible characteristics of the response distributions:
different means; different variances; bimodal behaviour; existence of outliers.

  Reinforcement Learning via Polarization Policy Gradient",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cooperative multi-agent policy gradient (MAPG) algorithms have recently
attracted wide attention and are regarded as a general scheme for the
multi-agent system. Credit assignment plays an important role in MAPG and can
induce cooperation among multiple agents. However, most MAPG algorithms cannot
achieve good credit assignment because of the game-theoretic pathology known as
\textit{centralized-decentralized mismatch}. To address this issue, this paper
presents a novel method, \textit{\underline{M}ulti-\underline{A}gent
\underline{P}olarization \underline{P}olicy \underline{G}radient} (MAPPG).
MAPPG takes a simple but efficient polarization function to transform the
optimal consistency of joint and individual actions into easily realized
constraints, thus enabling efficient credit assignment in MAPG. Theoretically,
we prove that individual policies of MAPPG can converge to the global optimum.
Empirically, we evaluate MAPPG on the well-known matrix game and differential
game, and verify that MAPPG can converge to the global optimum for both
discrete and continuous action spaces. We also evaluate MAPPG on a set of
StarCraft II micromanagement tasks and demonstrate that MAPPG outperforms the
state-of-the-art MAPG algorithms.

numerical experiments on both linear and quasilinear diffusion problems, using

constraints are nonconvex and complicated, like cardinality constraints,
disjunctive programs, or matrix problems involving rank constraints. By a
variable duplication and decomposition strategy, the method presented here
explicitly handles these difficult constraints, thus generating iterates which
are feasible with respect to them, while the remaining (standard and
supposingly simple) constraints are tackled by sequential penalization. Inexact
optimization steps are proven sufficient for the esulting algorithm to work, so
that it is employable even with difficult objective functions. The current work
is therefore a significant generalization of existing papers on penalty
decomposition methods. On the other hand, it is related to some recent
publications which use an augmented Lagrangian idea to solve optimization
problems with geometric constraints. Compared to these methods, the
decomposition idea is shown to be numerically superior since it allows much
more freedom in the choice of the subproblem solver, and since the number of
certain (possibly expensive) projection steps is significantly less. Extensive
numerical results on several highly complicated classes of optimization
problems in vector and matrix paces indicate that the current method is indeed
very efficient to solve these problems.

We compute $R_{\rm mol}$ as a function of different physical quantities. While
the spatially-resolved $R_{\rm mol}$ on average decreases with increasing

In macroscopic junctions, a local vector potential drives the currents,

various shapes, they are governed by non-local electrodynamics. This
complicates the extraction of parameters such as the geometry of the effective
junction area, the effective junction length and, the critical current density
distribution from the $I_{\text{c}}(B)$ interference patterns. Here we provide
a method to tackle this problem by simulating the phase differences that drive
the shielding currents and use those to find $I_{\text{c}}(B)$. To this end, we
extend the technique proposed by John Clem [Phys. Rev. B, \textbf{81}, 144515

superconducting strip of length $L$ and width $W$ with rectangular, ellipsoid

By fabricating elliptically shaped S$-$N$-$S junctions with various aspect
ratios, we experimentally verify the $L/W$ dependence of $\Delta B$. Finally,
we incorporate these results to correctly extract the distribution of critical
currents in the junction by the Fourier analysis of $I_{\text{c}}(B)$, which
makes these results essential for the correct analysis of topological channels

introduces an intermediate domain generated by mixing images in the source and
the target domain. Specifically, to generate the optimal intermediate domain
for different target data, we propose a novel target guided dynamic mixup

mixed images via dynamic mixup. The proposed TGDM framework contains a Mixup-3T
network for learning classifiers and a dynamic ratio generation network (DRGN)
for learning the optimal mix ratio. To better transfer the knowledge, the
proposed Mixup-3T network contains three branches with shared parameters for
classifying classes in the source domain, target domain, and intermediate

generate an optimal mix ratio according to the performance on auxiliary target

that TGDM can rectify itself to achieve optimal performance on target data.

  Architecture Search Algorithms",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Evolutionary computation-based neural architecture search (ENAS) is a popular
technique for automating architecture design of deep neural networks. In recent
years, various ENAS algorithms have been proposed and shown promising
performance on diverse real-world applications. In contrast to these
groundbreaking applications, there is no theoretical guideline for assigning a
reasonable running time (mainly affected by the generation number, population
size, and evolution operator) given both the anticipated performance and
acceptable computation budget on ENAS problems. The expected hitting time
(EHT), which refers to the average generations, is considered to analyze the
running time of ENAS algorithms. This paper proposes a general framework for
estimating the EHT of ENAS algorithms, which includes common configuration,
search space partition, transition probability estimation, and hitting time
analysis. By exploiting the proposed framework, we consider the so-called
($\lambda$+$\lambda$)-ENAS algorithms with different mutation operators and
manage to estimate the lower bounds of the EHT {which are critical for the
algorithm to find the global optimum}. Furthermore, we study the theoretical
results on the NAS-Bench-101 architecture searching problem, and the results
show that the one-bit mutation with ""bit-based fair mutation"" strategy needs
less time than the ""offspring-based fair mutation"" strategy, and the bitwise
mutation operator needs less time than the $q$-bit mutation operator. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work focusing on the theory of ENAS,
and the above observation will be substantially helpful in designing efficient
ENAS algorithms.

tasks are presented sequentially. Unlike humans, neural networks suffer greatly
from catastrophic forgetting, making it impossible to perform life-long
learning. To address this issue, memory-based continual learning has been
actively studied and stands out as one of the best-performing methods. We
examine memory-based continual learning and identify that large variation in
the representation space is crucial for avoiding catastrophic forgetting.
Motivated by this, we propose to diversify representations by using two types
of perturbations: model-agnostic variation (i.e., the variation is generated
without the knowledge of the learned neural network) and model-based variation
(i.e., the variation is conditioned on the learned neural network). We
demonstrate that enlarging representational variation serves as a general
principle to improve continual learning. Finally, we perform empirical studies
which demonstrate that our method, as a simple plug-and-play component, can
consistently improve a number of memory-based continual learning methods by a
large margin.

point is assigned a ``color'' (or a ``category'') and the goal is to store them
in a data structure such that the number of distinct categories inside a given
query range can be counted efficiently. CRC has strong motivations as it allows
data structure to deal with categorical data. However, colors (i.e., the
categories) in the CRC problem do not have any internal structure, whereas this
is not the case for many datasets in practice where hierarchical categories
exists or where a single input belongs to multiple categories. Motivated by
these, we consider variants of the problem where such structures can be
represented. We define two variants of the problem called hierarchical range
counting (HCC) and sub-category colored range counting (SCRC) and consider
hierarchical structures that can either be a DAG or a tree. We show that the
two problems on some special trees are in fact equivalent to other well-known
problems in the literature. Based on these, we also give efficient data
structures when the underlying hierarchy can be represented as a tree. We show
a conditional lower bound for the general case when the existing hierarchy can
be any DAG, through reductions from the orthogonal vectors problem.

fraction within the FRII RGs population does not strongly depend on radio
luminosity. This suggests that the jet properties in powerful FRII radio
sources do not depend on the accretion mode and on the structure of the
accretion disk as expected if the jet launching process is due to the
extraction of the rotational energy of the supermassive black hole. The
alternative possibility of recurrent transitions between a LEG and a HEG phase
is disfavored based on the variation timescales of the various AGN components.

intrinsic motivation for reinforcement learning with a sparse reward. However,
the use of episodic count in a high-dimensional state space as well as over a
long episode time requires a thorough state compression and fast hashing, which
hinders rigorous exploitation of it in such hard and complex exploration
environments. Moreover, the interference from task-irrelevant observations in
the episodic count may cause its intrinsic motivation to overlook task-related
important changes of states, and the novelty in an episodic manner can lead to
repeatedly revisit the familiar states across episodes. In order to resolve
these issues, in this paper, we propose a learnable hash-based episodic count,
which we name LECO, that efficiently performs as a task-specific intrinsic
reward in hard exploration problems. In particular, the proposed intrinsic
reward consists of the episodic novelty and the task-specific modulation where
the former employs a vector quantized variational autoencoder to automatically
obtain the discrete state codes for fast counting while the latter regulates
the episodic novelty by learning a modulator to optimize the task-specific
extrinsic reward. The proposed LECO specifically enables the automatic
transition from exploration to exploitation during reinforcement learning. We
experimentally show that in contrast to the previous exploration methods LECO
successfully solves hard exploration problems and also scales to large state
spaces through the most difficult tasks in MiniGrid and DMLab environments.

significant asteroseismic overestimation of mass and radius when compared with
eclipsing binary measurements. We measured dynamical masses and radii for both
components to be significantly lower than previously established, increasing
the discrepancy between asteroseismic and dynamical measurements. Our dynamical
measurements of the RG component were compared to corresponding measurements of
mass and radius using asteroseismic scaling relations. Uncorrected scaling
relations overestimated the mass of the RG by 26%, the radius by 11%, and the
average density by 7%, in agreement with studies for other systems. However,
using a theoretical correction to $\Delta \nu$, we managed to obtain an

We now formalize this notion, studying the open problem of class-specific

problem setting. We design a novel explainability method, DEMUX, which learns
saliency maps for explaining deep multi-class time series classifiers by
adaptively ensuring that its explanation spotlights the regions in an input

a gradient-based approach composed of three interdependent modules that combine
to generate consistent, class-specific saliency maps that remain faithful to
the classifier's behavior yet are easily understood by end users. Our
experimental study demonstrates that DEMUX outperforms nine state-of-the-art

More precisely, such a solution decomposes into the sum of one modulated

radiation. Applying the pseudoconformal transform in reverse, we also obtain a
refined soliton resolution theorem for $m$-equivariant, $m\geq1$, $H^{3,3}$

(to $0$), or scatter to a modulated soliton with some fixed scale and phase. To

  Our analysis not only builds upon the previous works, especially the soliton

the arguments typically employed in the forward construction of blow-up

regular parts of any $H^{3}$ finite-time blow-up solutions, such that the
evolution of the singular part is governed by a universal modulation dynamics
while the regular part is kept $H^{3}$-bounded even up to the blow-up time. As

there is significant seasonal variability in Earth's thermal emission spectrum,
and the strength of spectral features of bio-indicators, such as N2O, CH4, O3

found a strong spectral degeneracy with respect to the latter two indicating
that multi-epoch measurements and time-dependent signals may be required in

Z\to\ell\ell,\nu\nu$ with $\ell=e, \mu$) and the Higgs bosons each decay into a
pair of $b$-quarks. It targets $Vhh$ signals from both non-resonant $hh$
production, present in the Standard Model (SM), and resonant $hh$ production,
as predicted in some SM extensions. A 95% confidence-level upper limit of 183

production when assuming the kinematics are as expected in the SM. Constraints
are also placed on Higgs boson coupling modifiers. For the resonant search,
upper limits on the production cross-sections are derived for two specific
models: one is the production of a vector boson along with a neutral heavy
scalar resonance $H$, in the mass range 260-1000 GeV, that decays into $hh$,
and the other is the production of a heavier neutral pseudoscalar resonance $A$
that decays into a $Z$ boson and $H$ boson, where the $A$ boson mass is 360-800
GeV and the $H$ boson mass is 260-400 GeV. Constraints are also derived in the
parameter space of two-Higgs-doublet models.

accelerator complex, a barrier-bucket scheme has been developed to reduce the
beam loss during the 5-turn extraction from the PS towards the SPS, the
so-called Multi-Turn Extraction. The low-level RF system must synchronise the
barrier phase with the PS extraction and SPS injection kickers to minimise the
number of particles lost during the rise times of their fields. As the RF
voltage of the wide-band cavity generating the barrier bucket would be too low
for a conventional synchronisation, a combination of a feedforward cogging
manipulation and the real-time control of the barrier phase has been developed
and tested. A deterministic frequency bump has been added to compensate for the
imperfect circumference ratio between PS and SPS. This contribution presents
the concept and implementation of the synchronised barrier-bucket transfer.
Measurements with high-intensity beam demonstrate the feasibility of the
proposed transfer scheme.

task by pre-training a language model that can exclusively disambiguate word

conjunction with additional strategies to induce senses. In this paper, we
propose a novel unsupervised method based on hierarchical clustering and
invariant information clustering (IIC). The IIC is used to train a small model
to optimize the mutual information between two vector representations of a
target word occurring in a pair of synthetic paraphrases. This model is later
used in inference mode to extract a higher quality vector representation to be
used in the hierarchical clustering. We evaluate our method on two WSI tasks

powers are comparable with the powers of parametric tests in cases where both

When the parametric model for the intensity function is wrong, our tests
achieve higher powers. The proposed methods rely on Monte Carlo testing and
take advantage of the newly introduced covariate-weighted residual measure. We
also define a correlation coefficient between a point process and a covariate
and a partial correlation coefficient quantifying the dependence between a
point process and a covariate of interest while removing the influence of
nuisance covariates.

modeling mass-related loads within the lithosphere, physical parameters such as
the elastic thickness of the lithosphere can be inferred from gravity and
topography data. In the impact basin region, however, the low
topography-gravity correlation and the sharp change in admittance from negative
to positive within a narrow spheric harmonic degree make this model
inapplicable. In this work, we incorporated mantle uplift structures commonly
formed in impact basin regions into the lithospheric loading model. The
crustal-mantle boundary of this mantle uplift structure is inferred from the
global crustal thickness model. The gravity anomaly of the deflected
lithosphere is calculated at the surface and crustal-mantle boundary, then the
theoretical gravity admittance and correlation can be compared with the
observed data. We sampled parameters using this mantle loading model at Argyre

as it will naturally arise in emergent gravity models where gravity is due to
the effect of some fundamental particles, with the latter expected to behave
collectively like a fluid at the macroscopic scale. We call this the
fluid/gravity equivalence. The key difficulty with the fluid/gravity
equivalence is to find the correct metric-fluid relation (the relation between
the emergent metric and the fluid properties) so that the fluid not only has
physically acceptable properties but also obeys the usual hydrodynamic
equations, while at the same time the emergent metric also obeys the Einstein
equations. Faced with the problem, we have previously made a tentative proposal
of the metric-fluid relation, focusing only on obtaining physically acceptable
predictions on the fluid properties. In this paper, however, we find that for
the general gravitational wave spacetime near the null infinity, the underlying
fluid not only has physically acceptable properties, but also satisfies the
expected relativistic hydrodynamic equations in the Minkowski background, thus

  Picosecond Laser Interactions with Near Critical Density Plasmas",,,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the interaction of kilojoule, picosecond laser pulse with
long-scale length preplasma or homogeneous near critical density (NCD) plasma
is crucial for guiding experiments at national short-pulse laser facilities.
Using full three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that
in this regime, cross-filament stochastic acceleration is an important
mechanism that contributes to the production of superponderomotive, high-flux
electron beams. Since the laser power significantly exceeds the threshold of
the relativistic self-focusing, multiple filaments are generated and can
propagate independently over a long distance. Electrons jump across the
filaments during the acceleration, and their motion becomes stochastic. We find
that the effective temperature of electrons increases with the total
interaction time following a scaling like $T_{\rm eff}\propto\tau_{i}^{0.65}$.
By irradiating a submillimeter thick NCD target, the space charge of electrons
with energy above 2.5 MeV reaches tens of $\mu$C. Such high-flux electrons with
superponderomotive energies significantly facilitate applications in
high-energy-density science, nuclear science, secondary sources and diagnostic
techniques.

low-light image enhancement. However, the Retinex model does not explicitly
tackle the noise problem, and shows unsatisfactory enhancing results. In recent
years, due to the excellent performance, deep learning models have been widely
used in low-light image enhancement. However, these methods have two
limitations: i) The desirable performance can only be achieved by deep learning
when a large number of labeled data are available. However, it is not easy to
curate massive low/normal-light paired data; ii) Deep learning is notoriously a
black-box model [1]. It is difficult to explain their inner-working mechanism
and understand their behaviors. In this paper, using a sequential Retinex
decomposition strategy, we design a plug-and-play framework based on the
Retinex theory for simultaneously image enhancement and noise removal.
Meanwhile, we develop a convolutional neural network-based (CNN-based) denoiser
into our proposed plug-and-play framework to generate a reflectance component.
The final enhanced image is produced by integrating the illumination and
reflectance with gamma correction. The proposed plug-and-play framework can
facilitate both post hoc and ad hoc interpretability. Extensive experiments on

timings of data packets and acknowledgment (ACK) packets from all nodes in a
network. The meta-data report the source node of each packet, but not the
destination nodes or the contents of the packets. The goal of the processor is
to infer the network topology based solely on such information. Prior work
leveraged causality metrics to identify which links are active. If the data
timings and ACK timings of two nodes -- say node 1 and node 2, respectively --
are causally related, this may be taken as evidence that node 1 is
communicating to node 2 (which sends back ACK packets to node 1). This paper
starts with the observation that packet losses can weaken the causality
relationship between data and ACK timing streams. To obviate this problem, a
new Expectation Maximization (EM)-based algorithm is introduced -- EM-causality
discovery algorithm (EM-CDA) -- which treats packet losses as latent variables.
EM-CDA iterates between the estimation of packet losses and the evaluation of
causality metrics. The method is validated through extensive experiments in
wireless sensor networks on the NS-3 simulation platform.

in some important areas, multiple interventions are concurrently applied.
Disentangling the effects of single interventions from jointly applied
interventions is a challenging task -- especially as simultaneously applied
interventions can interact. This problem is made harder still by unobserved
confounders, which influence both treatments and outcome. We address this
challenge by aiming to learn the effect of a single-intervention from both

generally possible, but provide identification proofs demonstrating that it can
be achieved under non-linear continuous structural causal models with additive,
multivariate Gaussian noise -- even when unobserved confounders are present.
Importantly, we show how to incorporate observed covariates and learn
heterogeneous treatment effects. Based on the identifiability proofs, we
provide an algorithm that learns the causal model parameters by pooling data

inference on the raw images degrades the test accuracy due to the difference in
covariance of the raw images captured by the image sensors compared to the
ISP-processed images used for training. Moreover, it is difficult to train deep
CV models on raw images, because most (if not all) large-scale open-source
datasets consist of RGB images. To mitigate this concern, we propose to invert
the ISP pipeline, which can convert the RGB images of any dataset to its raw
counterparts, and enable model training on raw images. We release the raw

the mechanisms that produce them and the construction of efficient prediction
schemes are of paramount importance. The source regions of flares and CMEs
exhibit some common morphological characteristics associated with strongly
sheared magnetic polarity inversion lines, indicative of the complex magnetic
configurations that store huge amounts of free magnetic energy and helicity.
This knowledge is transformed into parameters that can help us distinguish
efficiently between quiet, flare-, and CME-productive active regions.
Nonetheless, flare and CME prediction still faces a number of challenges. The
magnetic field information is constrained at the photosphere and accessed only
from one vantage point of observation; the dynamic behavior of active regions
is still not fully incorporated into predictions; the stochasticity of flares
and CMEs renders their prediction probabilistic. To meet these challenges, new
properties have been put forward to describe different aspects of magnetic
energy storage mechanisms in active regions and offer the opportunity of
parametric studies for over an entire solar cycle. This inventory of predictors
now includes information from flow fields, transition region/coronal
spectroscopy, data-driven modeling of the coronal magnetic field, as well as
parameterizations of dynamic effects from time series. Further work towards
these directions may help alleviate the current limitations in observing the
magnetic field of higher atmospheric layers. This paper reviews these efforts
as well as the importance of transforming new knowledge into more efficient
predictors and including new types of data.

Whether compression schemes of size $O(d)$ must necessarily exist for all

Recently Chalopin, Chepoi, Moran, and Warmuth (2018) gave a beautiful

would imply that all extremal classes admit unlabelled compression schemes of

overestimation of the upwind MSS described by the linear fit of CM at moderate

coefficient being maximal at moderate wind speeds, features that CM could not
point out due to the limitations of their measurements. We revisit the
renormalization procedure employed by CM to obtain the complete variances from
truncated pdfs and show that it imposes stringent conditions on the kurtosis

poor consideration towards frequency information, especially high-frequency

awareness and draws more attention to producing high-frequency signals,
facilitating high-quality generation. In addition to exploiting both real and
generated images' frequency information, we also involve the frequency signals
of real images as a self-supervised constraint, which alleviates the GAN
disequilibrium and encourages the generator to synthesize adequate rather than
arbitrary frequency signals. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority and
effectiveness of our FreGAN in ameliorating generation quality in the low-data

seamlessly applied to existing regularization and attention mechanism models to
further boost the performance.

network to map (non-)matching image pairs to (non-)similar representations.
During testing, which typically corresponds to image retrieval, both database
and query examples are processed by the same network to obtain the
representation used for similarity estimation and ranking. In this work, we
explore an asymmetric setup by light-weight processing of the query at a small
image resolution to enable fast representation extraction. The goal is to
obtain a network for database examples that is trained to operate on large
resolution images and benefits from fine-grained image details, and a second
network for query examples that operates on small resolution images but
preserves a representation space aligned with that of the database network. We
achieve this with a distillation approach that transfers knowledge from a fixed
teacher network to a student via a loss that operates per image and solely
relies on coupled augmentations without the use of any labels. In contrast to
prior work that explores such asymmetry from the point of view of different
network architectures, this work uses the same architecture but modifies the
image resolution. We conclude that resolution asymmetry is a better way to
optimize the performance/efficiency trade-off than architecture asymmetry.

comparably to the relevant electronic properties of the material. One therefore
expects to observe similar dynamics, irrespective of the choice of atomic

metal dichalcogenide semiconductor $MoSe_2$, that through a selenium-based
transition we observe charge carriers acting independently from each other,
while when probed through molybdenum, the collective, many-body motion of the
carriers dominates. Such unexpectedly contrasting behavior can be traced back
to a strong localization of electrons around molybdenum atoms following
absorption of light, which modifies the local fields acting on the carriers. We

the creation of new numerical formats. In this work we focus on the family of
block floating point numerical formats due to their combination of wide dynamic
range, numerical accuracy, and efficient hardware implementation of inner
products using simple integer arithmetic. These formats are characterized by a
block of mantissas with a shared scale factor. The basic Block Floating Point
(BFP) format quantizes the block scales into the nearest powers of two on the
right. Its simple modification - Scaled BFP (SBFP) - stores the same scales in
full precision and thus allows higher accuracy. In this paper, we study the
statistical behavior of both these formats rigorously. We develop asymptotic
bounds on the inner product error in SBFP- and BFP-quantized normally
distributed vectors. Next, we refine those asymptotic results to finite
dimensional settings and derive high-dimensional tight bounds for the same
errors. Based on the obtained results we introduce a performance measure
assessing accuracy of any block format. This measure allows us to determine the
optimal parameters, such as the block size, yielding highest accuracy. In
particular, we show that if the precision of the BFP format is fixed at 4 bits,
the optimal block size becomes 64. All theoretical derivations are supported by
numerical experiments and studies on the weights of publicly available

agent in a population makes a decision on strategy selection and revision to
engage in repeated games with others. The strategy revision is subject to time
delays which represent the time it takes for an agent revising its strategy
needs to spend before it can adopt a new strategy and return back to the game.
We discuss the effect of the time delays on long-term behavior of the agents'
strategy revision. In particular, when the time delays are large, the strategy
revision would exhibit oscillation and the agents spend substantial time in
""transitioning"" between different strategies, which prevents the agents from
attaining the Nash equilibrium of the game. As a main contribution of the
paper, we propose an algorithm that tunes the rate of the agents' strategy
revision and show such tuning approach ensures convergence to the Nash
equilibrium. We validate our analytical results using simulations.

Then, $V(\lambda)$ is a component of $V(\rho)\otimes V(\rho)$ if and only if
$\lambda \leq 2 \rho$ under the usual Bruhat-Chevalley order on the set of

generative models. A forward diffusion process slowly perturbs the data, while
a deep model learns to gradually denoise. Synthesis amounts to solving a
differential equation (DE) defined by the learnt model. Solving the DE requires
slow iterative solvers for high-quality generation. In this work, we propose
Higher-Order Denoising Diffusion Solvers (GENIE): Based on truncated Taylor
methods, we derive a novel higher-order solver that significantly accelerates
synthesis. Our solver relies on higher-order gradients of the perturbed data
distribution, that is, higher-order score functions. In practice, only
Jacobian-vector products (JVPs) are required and we propose to extract them
from the first-order score network via automatic differentiation. We then
distill the JVPs into a separate neural network that allows us to efficiently
compute the necessary higher-order terms for our novel sampler during
synthesis. We only need to train a small additional head on top of the
first-order score network. We validate GENIE on multiple image generation
benchmarks and demonstrate that GENIE outperforms all previous solvers. Unlike
recent methods that fundamentally alter the generation process in DDMs, our
GENIE solves the true generative DE and still enables applications such as

it has a great potential in privacy-preserving outsourcing of computations to
the cloud. Hardware acceleration of HE is crucial as software implementations
are very slow. In this paper, we present design methodologies for building a
programmable hardware accelerator for speeding up the cloud-side homomorphic
evaluations on encrypted data. First, we propose a divide-and-conquer technique
that enables homomorphic evaluations in a large polynomial ring $R_{Q,2N}$ to
use a hardware accelerator that has been built for the smaller ring $R_{Q,N}$.
The technique makes it possible to use a single hardware accelerator flexibly
for supporting several HE parameter sets. Next, we present several
architectural design methods that we use to realize the flexible and
instruction-set accelerator architecture, which we call `Medha'. At every level
of the implementation hierarchy, we explore possibilities for parallel
processing. Starting from hardware-friendly parallel algorithms for the basic
building blocks, we gradually build heavily parallel RNS polynomial arithmetic
units. Next, many of these parallel units are interconnected elegantly so that
their interconnections require the minimum number of nets, therefore making the
overall architecture placement-friendly on the platform. For Medha, we take a
memory-conservative design approach and get rid of any off-chip memory access
during homomorphic evaluations. Finally, we implement Medha in a Xilinx Alveo
U250 FPGA and measure timing performances of the microcoded homomorphic
addition, multiplication, key-switching, and rescaling for the leveled HE
scheme RNS-HEAAN at 200 MHz clock frequency. For two large parameter sets,
Medha achieves accelerations by up to 68x and 78x times respectively compared
to a highly optimized software implementation Microsoft SEAL running at 2.3
GHz.

positions is a primary tool in understanding chemical reactions from first
principles. However, obtaining this information is complicated by the fact that
sampling a large number of ground states over a high-dimensional PES can
require a vast number of state preparations. In this work, we propose using a
generative quantum machine learning model to prepare quantum states at
arbitrary points on the PES. The model is trained using quantum data consisting
of ground-state wavefunctions associated with different classical nuclear
coordinates. Our approach uses a classical neural network to convert the
nuclear coordinates of a molecule into quantum parameters of a variational
quantum circuit. The model is trained using a fidelity loss function to
optimize the neural network parameters. We show that gradient evaluation is
efficient and numerically demonstrate our method's ability to prepare
wavefunctions on the PES of hydrogen chains, water, and beryllium hydride. In
all cases, we find that a small number of training points are needed to achieve
very high overlap with the groundstates in practice. From a theoretical
perspective, we further prove limitations on these protocols by showing that if
we were able to learn across an avoided crossing using a small number of
samples, then we would be able to violate Grover's lower bound. Additionally,
we prove lower bounds on the amount of quantum data needed to learn a locally
optimal neural network function using arguments from quantum Fisher
information. This work further identifies that quantum chemistry can be an
important use case for quantum machine learning.

competition that has served as a benchmark for multi-agent AI research. While
self-play reinforcement learning has resulted in numerous successes in purely
adversarial games like chess, Go, and poker, self-play alone is insufficient
for achieving optimal performance in domains involving cooperation with humans.
We address this shortcoming by first introducing a planning algorithm we call
DiL-piKL that regularizes a reward-maximizing policy toward a human
imitation-learned policy. We prove that this is a no-regret learning algorithm
under a modified utility function. We then show that DiL-piKL can be extended
into a self-play reinforcement learning algorithm we call RL-DiL-piKL that
provides a model of human play while simultaneously training an agent that
responds well to this human model. We used RL-DiL-piKL to train an agent we
name Diplodocus. In a 200-game no-press Diplomacy tournament involving 62 human
participants spanning skill levels from beginner to expert, two Diplodocus
agents both achieved a higher average score than all other participants who
played more than two games, and ranked first and third according to an Elo

Standard visual relocalization requires hundreds of images and scale

Relocalization, i.e., using only one photo of a scene to enable instant, metric
scaled relocalization. Existing datasets are not suitable to benchmark map-free
relocalization, due to their focus on large scenes or their limited
variability. Thus, we have constructed a new dataset of 655 small places of
interest, such as sculptures, murals and fountains, collected worldwide. Each
place comes with a reference image to serve as a relocalization anchor, and
dozens of query images with known, metric camera poses. The dataset features
changing conditions, stark viewpoint changes, high variability across places,
and queries with low to no visual overlap with the reference image. We identify
two viable families of existing methods to provide baseline results: relative
pose regression, and feature matching combined with single-image depth
prediction. While these methods show reasonable performance on some favorable

optimization of training), which we argue is sub-optimal and will lead to
excessive computation. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization
procedure, namely FSAM, which introduces a Fisher mask to improve the
efficiency and performance of SAM. In short, instead of adding perturbation to
all parameters, FSAM uses the Fisher information to identity the important
parameters and formulates a Fisher mask to obtain the sparse perturbation,
i.e., making the optimizer focus on these important parameters. Experiments on
various tasks in GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks show that FSAM consistently
outperforms the vanilla SAM by 0.67~1.98 average score among four different

complex scenarios, e.g., fine-tuning on generation tasks or limited training

in turn. In this paper, we focus on evidence-based fake news detection, where
several evidences are utilized to probe the veracity of news (i.e., a claim).
Most previous methods first employ sequential models to embed the semantic
information and then capture the claim-evidence interaction based on attention
mechanisms. Despite their effectiveness, they still suffer from three
weaknesses. Firstly, sequential models fail to integrate the relevant
information that is scattered far apart in evidences. Secondly, they
underestimate much redundant information in evidences may be useless or
harmful. Thirdly, insufficient data utilization limits the separability and
reliability of representations captured by the model. To solve these problems,
we propose a unified Graph-based sEmantic structure mining framework with
ConTRAstive Learning, namely GETRAL in short. Specifically, we first model
claims and evidences as graph-structured data to capture the long-distance
semantic dependency. Consequently, we reduce information redundancy by
performing graph structure learning. Then the fine-grained semantic
representations are fed into the claim-evidence interaction module for
predictions. Finally, an adversarial contrastive learning module is applied to
make full use of data and strengthen representation learning. Comprehensive
experiments have demonstrated the superiority of GETRAL over the
state-of-the-arts and validated the efficacy of semantic mining with graph

long document, which is essential for long-range understanding. To tackle this
problem, we propose Compressive Graph Selector Network (CGSN) to capture the
global structure in a compressive and iterative manner. The proposed model
mainly focuses on the evidence selection phase of long document question
answering. Specifically, it consists of three modules: local graph network,
global graph network and evidence memory network. Firstly, the local graph
network builds the graph structure of the chunked segment in token, sentence,
paragraph and segment levels to capture the short-term dependency of the text.
Secondly, the global graph network selectively receives the information of each
level from the local graph, compresses them into the global graph nodes and
applies graph attention to the global graph nodes to build the long-range
reasoning over the entire text in an iterative way. Thirdly, the evidence
memory network is designed to alleviate the redundancy problem in the evidence
selection by saving the selected result in the previous steps. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed model outperforms previous methods on two

recently gained attention as they bring the contextualization power of

work, we examine the generalizability of two of these deep contextualized
term-based models in the context of query-by-example (QBE) retrieval in which a
seed document acts as the query to find relevant documents. In this setting --
where queries are much longer than common keyword queries -- BERT inference at
query time is problematic as it involves quadratic complexity. We investigate
TILDE and TILDEv2, both of which leverage BERT tokenizer as their query
encoder. With this approach, there is no need for BERT inference at query time,
and also the query can be of any length. Our extensive evaluation on the four
QBE tasks of SciDocs benchmark shows that in a query-by-example retrieval
setting TILDE and TILDEv2 are still less effective than a cross-encoder BERT
ranker. However, we observe that BM25 could show a competitive ranking quality
compared to TILDE and TILDEv2 which is in contrast to the findings about the
relative performance of these three models on retrieval for short queries
reported in prior work. This result raises the question about the use of
contextualized term-based ranking models being beneficial in QBE setting. We
follow-up on our findings by studying the score interpolation between the
relevance score from TILDE (TILDEv2) and BM25. We conclude that these two
contextualized term-based ranking models capture different relevance signals
than BM25 and combining the different term-based rankers results in
statistically significant improvements in QBE retrieval. Our work sheds light
on the challenges of retrieval settings different from the common evaluation
benchmarks.

end-to-end two-view SfM network, we formulate the two-view SfM problem as a
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and solve it with the proposed framework,

maps to depict the visual similarities of 2D image matches decided by
ego-motion. In addition, in order to increase the robustness of our framework,
we formulate the likelihood function of the correlations of 2D image matches as
a Gaussian and Uniform mixture distribution which takes the uncertainty caused
by illumination changes, image noise and moving objects into account.
Meanwhile, an uncertainty prediction module is presented to predict the
pixel-wise distribution parameters. Finally, we iteratively refine the depth

computationally efficient and robust unscented Kalman filter, and 3)
reconstruction of an asteroid spherical harmonic shape model by leveraging a
priori knowledge of the shape properties of celestial bodies. Despite
significant interest in asteroids, there are several limitations to current
asteroid rendezvous mission concepts. First, completed missions heavily rely on
human oversight and Earth-based resources. Second, proposed solutions to
increase autonomy make oversimplifying assumptions about state knowledge and
information processing. Third, asteroid mission concepts often opt for high

Finally, such missions often utilize a single spacecraft, neglecting the
benefits of distributed space systems. In contrast, ANS is composed of multiple
autonomous nanosatellites equipped with low SWaP-C avionics. The ANS SNAC
framework is validated through a numerical simulation of three spacecraft

approximating the exact relevance measurement based on PQ (product
quantization). However, the conventional IVFPQ is limited in retrieval
performance due to the coarse granularity of its latent topics. On the one

explicit terms, to build the inverted file system. Both types of features are
complementary to each other, which helps to achieve better coverage of the
relevant documents. Besides, the documents' memberships to different IVF

substantially improves the index quality and retrieval accuracy. We perform

constraint to re-balance the prior, thereby specifying the target distribution
instead of the original prior. Thus, generated samples from the re-balanced

over a large dynamic range using quantum algorithms. The adaptive phase
estimation algorithm (PEA) is one example that was proven to achieve such high
sensitivities with single-shot readout (SSR) sensors. However, using the
adaptive PEA on a non-SSR sensor is not trivial due to the low contrast nature
of the measurement. The standard approach to account for the averaged nature of
the measurement in this PEA algorithm is to use a method based on `majority
voting'. Although it is easy to implement, this method is more prone to
mistakes due to noise in the measurement. To reduce these mistakes, a binomial
distribution technique from a batch selection was recently shown theoretically
to be superior, as all ranges of outcomes from an averaged measurement are
considered. Here we apply, for the first time, real-time non-adaptive PEA on a
non-SSR sensor with the binomial distribution approach. We compare the mean
square error of the binomial distribution method to the majority-voting
approach using the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond at ambient conditions as
a non-SSR sensor. Our results suggest that the binomial distribution approach
achieves better accuracy with the same sensing times. To further shorten the
sensing time, we propose an adaptive algorithm that controls the readout phase
and, therefore, the measurement basis set. We show by numerical simulation that
adding the adaptive protocol can further improve the accuracy in a future
real-time experiment.

$\lambda\mapsto c(\lambda)$ is differentiable except at most a countable set,

be improved given more assumptions on the source of the equation.
  We show further that $c'(0)$ exists if and only if a new invariant on

the convergence of a vanishing discount problem with respect to changing

ensemble. In most applications, however, the average number of electrons is
known rather than the chemical potential, requiring that expensive correlation
calculations must be repeated iteratively in search for the chemical potential
that yields the desired average number of electrons. In extended systems with
mobile charges, however, the long-ranged electrostatic interaction should
guarantee that the average ratio of negative and positive charges is one for
any finite chemical potential. All properties per electron are virtually
independent of the chemical potential, as for instance in an electric wire at
different voltage potentials.
  This work shows that the infinite-size limit of the exchange-correlation free
energy agrees with the infinite-size limit of the exchange-correlation grand
potential at a non-interacting chemical potential. The latter requires only one
expensive correlation calculation for each system size. Analogous to classical
simulations of long-range-interacting particles, this work uses a
regularization of the Coulomb interaction such that each electron on average
interacts only with as many electrons as there are electrons in the simulation,
avoiding interactions with periodic images.

large, decentralised swarm of simple mobile agents must detect the locations of
tasks in the plane and position themselves nearby. The tasks are represented by
an a priori unknown demand profile $\Phi(x,y)$ that determines how many agents
are needed in each location. The agents are autonomous, oblivious and
indistinguishable, and have finite sensing range. They must configure
themselves according to $\Phi$ using only local information about $\Phi$ and
about the positions of nearby agents. All agents act according to the same
local sensing-based rule of motion, and cannot explicitly communicate nor share
information.
  We propose an optimization-based approach to the problem which results in
attraction-repulsion dynamics. Repulsion encourages agents to spread out and
explore the region so as to find the tasks, and attraction causes them to
accumulate at task locations. We derive this approach via gradient descent over
an appropriate ``error'' functional, and test it extensively through numerical
simulations.

modeling. The commonly-adopted formulation of the latent code of diffusion
models is a sequence of gradually denoised samples, as opposed to the simpler
(e.g., Gaussian) latent space of GANs, VAEs, and normalizing flows. This paper
provides an alternative, Gaussian formulation of the latent space of various
diffusion models, as well as an invertible DPM-Encoder that maps images into
the latent space. While our formulation is purely based on the definition of
diffusion models, we demonstrate several intriguing consequences. (1)
Empirically, we observe that a common latent space emerges from two diffusion
models trained independently on related domains. In light of this finding, we
propose CycleDiffusion, which uses DPM-Encoder for unpaired image-to-image
translation. Furthermore, applying CycleDiffusion to text-to-image diffusion

zero-shot image-to-image editors. (2) One can guide pre-trained diffusion

information stored in weights during training, and information provided

exhibit different inductive biases in how they represent and generalize from

they generalize via parsimonious rules (rule-based generalization) or via
direct comparison with observed examples (exemplar-based generalization). This
is of important practical consequence, as it informs whether to encode

generalization from weights is more rule-based whereas generalization from

pre-trained on natural language, in-context learning is significantly
rule-based, with larger models showing more rule-basedness. We hypothesise that
rule-based generalization from in-context information might be an emergent
consequence of large-scale training on language, which has sparse rule-like

this principle, we formulate the common and view-specific information
bottleneck objectives across multiviews by using constraints from mutual

mutual information is computationally intractable. To tackle this challenge, we
derive variational lower and upper bounds of mutual information terms, and then
instead optimize variational bounds to find the approximate solutions for the
information objectives. Extensive experiments on graph benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness of the proposed method.

environment around it will evolve. For that purpose, it is important to know
which prediction models are most appropriate for every situation. Currently,
assessment of prediction models is often performed over a set of trajectories
without distinction of the type of movement they capture, resulting in the
inability to determine the suitability of each model for different situations.
In this work we illustrate how standardized evaluation methods result in wrong
conclusions regarding a model's predictive capabilities, preventing a clear
assessment of prediction models and potentially leading to dangerous on-road
situations. We argue that following evaluation practices in safety assessment
for AVs, assessment of prediction models should be performed in a
scenario-based fashion. To encourage scenario-based assessment of prediction
models and illustrate the dangers of improper assessment, we categorize
trajectories of the Waymo Open Motion dataset according to the type of movement
they capture. Next, three different models are thoroughly evaluated for
different trajectory types and prediction horizons. Results show that common
evaluation methods are insufficient and the assessment should be performed
depending on the application in which the model will operate.

opportunities in sensing and signal manipulation compared to their linear

design, fabricate and study drumhead resonators exhibiting strongly nonlinear
dynamics and develop a reduced order model (ROM) to capture their response
accurately. The resonators undergo electrostatically-mediated thermoelastic
buckling which tunes their natural frequency from 4.7 to 11.3 MHz, a factor of
2.4x tunability. Moreover, the imposed buckling switches the nonlinearity of
the resonators between purely stiffening, purely softening, and even
softening-to-stiffening. Accessing these exotic dynamics requires precise
control of the temperature and the DC electrostatic forces near the resonator's
critical-buckling point. To explain the observed tunability, we develop a
one-dimensional physics-based ROM that predicts the linear and nonlinear
response of the fundamental bending mode of these drumhead resonators. The ROM
captures the dynamic effects of the internal stresses resulting from three
sources: The residual stresses from the fabrication process, the mismatch in
thermal expansion between the constituent layers, and lastly, the applied
electrostatic forces. The ROM replicates the observed tunability of linear
(within 5.5% error) and nonlinear responses even near the states of critical
buckling. These remarkable nonlinear and large tunability of the natural
frequency are valuable features for on-chip acoustic devices in broad
applications such as signal manipulation, filtering, and MEMS waveguides.

computational complexity. They produced the famous Deutsch-Jozsa quantum
algorithm that offered an exponential speedup over the classical computer,
namely O[log(N)] complexity for the solution in a quantum computer. In this
paper, the problem is implemented on an instantaneous noise-based logic
processor. It is shown that, similarly to the quantum algorithm, the oDJ
problem can deterministically be solved with O[log(N)] complexity. The
implication is that by adding a truly random coin to a classical Turing machine
and using this classical-physical algorithm can also speed up the deterministic
solution of the Deutsch-Jozsa problem exponentially, similarly to the quantum
algorithm. Then it is realized that the same database and the solution of the
Deutsch-Jozsa problem can also be realized by using an identical algorithmic
structure in a simpler way, even without noise/random coin. The only lost
function in this new system, as compared to noise-based logic, is the ability
to do generic parallel logic operations over the whole database. As the latter
feature is not needed for the oDJ problem, it is concluded that the problem can
be solved on a classical computer with O[log(N)] complexity even without a
random coin. Therefore, while the oDJ algorithm is historically important step
in the developments of quantum computers, it is insufficient to prove quantum
supremacy. Note, there is also simplified Deutsch-Jozsa problem proposed later,
which is more popular in the field, however it is irrelevant for the present

  Intelligence",,,,,"physics.ao-ph cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To limit global warming to pre-industrial levels, global governments,
industry and academia are taking aggressive efforts to reduce carbon emissions.
The evaluation of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions, however,
depends on the self-reporting information that is not always reliable. Society
need to develop an objective, independent, and generalized system to meter
CO$_2$ emissions. Satellite CO$_2$ observation from space that reports
column-average regional CO$_2$ dry-air mole fractions has gradually indicated
its potential to build such a system. Nevertheless, estimating anthropogenic
CO$_2$ emissions from CO$_2$ observing satellite is bottlenecked by the
influence of the highly complicated physical characteristics of atmospheric
activities. Here we provide the first method that combines the advanced
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and the carbon satellite monitor to
quantify anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions. We propose an integral AI based
pipeline that contains both a data retrieval algorithm and a two-step
data-driven solution. First, the data retrieval algorithm can generate
effective datasets from multi-modal data including carbon satellite, the
information of carbon sources, and several environmental factors. Second, the
two-step data-driven solution that applies the powerful representation of deep
learning techniques to learn to quantify anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions from
satellite CO$_2$ observation with other factors. Our work unmasks the potential
of quantifying CO$_2$ emissions based on the combination of deep learning
algorithms and the carbon satellite monitor.

attacks in which a malicious adversary compromises a model during training such
that specific behaviour can be triggered at test time by attaching a specific

whether a model has been compromised and if so, identifying the backdoor
trigger. We present the first robust defence mechanism that generalizes to
several backdoor attacks against text classification models, without prior
knowledge of the attack type, nor does our method require access to any
(potentially compromised) training resources. Our experiments show that our
technique is highly accurate at defending against state-of-the-art backdoor

reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, there is a lack of unified evaluation
platforms and commonly-acknowledged baseline implementation. Therefore, an
urgent need is to develop an integrated library suite that delivers reliable
MARL implementation and replicable evaluation in various benchmarks. To fill
such a research gap, in this paper, we propose MARLlib, a comprehensive MARL
algorithm library for solving multi-agent problems. With a novel design of
agent-level distributed dataflow, MARLlib manages to unify tens of algorithms
in a highly composable integration style. Moreover, MARLlib goes beyond current
work by integrating diverse environment interfaces and providing flexible
parameter sharing strategies; this allows for versatile solutions to
cooperative, competitive, and mixed tasks with minimal code modifications for
end users. Finally, MARLlib provides easy-to-use APIs and a fully decoupled
configuration system to help end users manipulate the learning process. A
plethora of experiments is conducted to substantiate the correctness of our
implementation, based on which we further derive new insights into the
relationship between the performance and the design of algorithmic components.
With MARLlib, we expect researchers to be able to tackle broader real-world
multi-agent problems with trustworthy solutions. Github:

  materials","PhD Thesis",,,,"physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The incredible thermo-mechanical properties of biological materials arise
from the microscopic scale due to a complex hierarchical mechanism, regulated
by microinstabilities at the molecular level. The description of such complex
structures is allowed by both the know-how introduced by the advent of SMFS
experiments and the possibility of correctly mimicking their behaviour at the
lowest scales. In this thesis, different classes of models with non
convex-energies are introduced to describe the important features of phase
transition, decohesion and damage under different conditions of applied forces
and displacement, thermal fields and rates of loading. Moreover, within a
Statistical Mechanics framework, temperature effects are considered also
including the rate of loading. Different phenomena have been analyzed such as
the effect of the handling device in protein unfolding, the nucleation and
generation of phase interfaces in nanowires or the cooperativity of weak
interactions in double stranded chains, as in the case of the DNA or the
bundles of microtubules and tau proteins inside the neuronal axons. The results
obtained in the thesis are compared to pieces of evidence from an extensive
literature review and to the experimental behaviours of the systems described.

propagation is forbidden. In solid continua, bandgaps are the outcome of
destructive interferences resulting from periodically alternating layers. Under
certain conditions, natural frequencies emerge within these bandgaps in the
form of high-amplitude localized vibrations near a structural boundary,
referred to as truncation resonances. In this paper, we investigate the
vibrational spectrum of finite phononic crystals which take the form of a
one-dimensional rod, and explain the factors that contribute to the origination
of truncation resonances. By identifying a unit cell symmetry parameter, we
define a family of finite phononic rods which share the same dispersion
relation, yet distinct truncated forms. A transfer matrix method is utilized to
derive closed-form expressions of the characteristic equations governing the
natural frequencies of the finite system and decipher the truncation resonances
emerging across different boundary conditions. The analysis establishes
concrete connections between the localized vibrations associated with a
truncation resonance, boundary conditions, and the overall configuration of the
truncated chain as dictated by unit cell choice. The study provides tools to
predict, tune, and selectively design truncation resonances, to meet the
demands of various applications that require and uniquely benefit from such
truncation resonances.

challenging due to privacy concerns, which hinders the use of ML for healthcare
applications. Synthetic EHRs generation bypasses the need to share sensitive
real patient records. However, existing methods generate single-modal EHRs by
unconditional generation or by longitudinal inference, which falls short of low
flexibility and makes unrealistic EHRs. In this work, we propose to formulate
EHRs generation as a text-to-text translation task by language models (LMs),
which suffices to highly flexible event imputation during generation. We also
design prompt learning to control the generation conditioned by numerical and
categorical demographic features. We evaluate synthetic EHRs quality by two
perplexity measures accounting for their longitudinal pattern (longitudinal
imputation perplexity, lpl) and the connections cross modalities
(cross-modality imputation perplexity, mpl). Moreover, we utilize two
adversaries: membership and attribute inference attacks for privacy-preserving
evaluation. Experiments on MIMIC-III data demonstrate the superiority of our
methods on realistic EHRs generation (53.1\% decrease of lpl and 45.3\%
decrease of mpl on average compared to the best baselines) with low privacy
risks. Software is available at https://github.com/RyanWangZf/PromptEHR.

Published in ECML-PKDD 2022",,,,"q-fin.TR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Volume prediction is one of the fundamental objectives in the Fintech area,
which is helpful for many downstream tasks, e.g., algorithmic trading. Previous
methods mostly learn a universal model for different stocks. However, this kind
of practice omits the specific characteristics of individual stocks by applying
the same set of parameters for different stocks. On the other hand, learning
different models for each stock would face data sparsity or cold start problems
for many stocks with small capitalization. To take advantage of the data scale
and the various characteristics of individual stocks, we propose a dual-process
meta-learning method that treats the prediction of each stock as one task under
the meta-learning framework. Our method can model the common pattern behind
different stocks with a meta-learner, while modeling the specific pattern for
each stock across time spans with stock-dependent parameters. Furthermore, we
propose to mine the pattern of each stock in the form of a latent variable
which is then used for learning the parameters for the prediction module. This
makes the prediction procedure aware of the data pattern. Extensive experiments
on volume predictions show that our method can improve the performance of
various baseline models. Further analyses testify the effectiveness of our
proposed meta-learning framework.

begins with an introduction to Mathieu's equation and its stability analysis

a factorization of the monodromy matrix and provides a ""discrete change of

  Society of Computer and Information (KSCI)",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a natural language processing architecture that can
handle tasks that previously required two models as one model. With a single
model, we analyze the language patterns and conversational context of
Alzheimer's patients and derive answers from two results: patient
classification and chatbot. If the patient's language characteristics are
identified by chatbots in daily life, doctors can plan more precise diagnosis
and treatment for early diagnosis. The proposed model is used to develop
chatbots that replace questionnaires that required experts. There are two
natural language processing tasks performed by the model. The first is a
'natural language classification' that indicates with probability whether the
patient has an illness, and the second is to generate the next 'answer' of the
chatbot to the patient's answer. In the first half, a context vector, which is
a characteristic of patient utterance, is extracted through a self-attention
neural network. This context vector and chatbot (expert, moderator) questions
are entered together into the encoder to obtain a matrix containing the
characteristics of the interaction between the questioner and the patient. The
vectorized matrix becomes a probability value for classification of patients.
Enter the matrix into the decoder with the next answer from the chatbot (the
moderator) to generate the next utterance. As a result of learning this
structure with DmentiaBank's cookie theft description corpus, it was confirmed
that the value of the loss function of the encoder and decoder was
significantly reduced and converged. This shows that capturing the speech
language pattern of Alzheimer's disease patients can contribute to early
diagnosis and longitudinal studies of the disease in the future.

implications for their safety and fairness. Despite this, most current research
on compositionality is directed towards improving their performance on
similarity tasks only. This work takes a different approach, and proposes a
methodology for measuring compositional behavior in contemporary language
models. Specifically, we focus on adjectival modifier phenomena in
adjective-noun phrases. We introduce three novel tests of compositional
behavior inspired by Montague semantics. Our experimental results indicate that
current neural language models behave according to the expected linguistic
theories to a limited extent only. This raises the question of whether these
language models are not able to capture the semantic properties we evaluated,
or whether linguistic theories from Montagovian tradition would not match the
expected capabilities of distributional models.
