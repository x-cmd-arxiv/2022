  Physically-plausible Motion In-betweening","Accepted by ACMMM2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Human motion synthesis is a long-standing problem with various applications
in digital twins and the Metaverse. However, modern deep learning based motion
synthesis approaches barely consider the physical plausibility of synthesized
motions and consequently they usually produce unrealistic human motions. In
order to solve this problem, we propose a system ``Skeleton2Humanoid'' which
performs physics-oriented motion correction at test time by regularizing
synthesized skeleton motions in a physics simulator. Concretely, our system
consists of three sequential stages: (I) test time motion synthesis network
adaptation, (II) skeleton to humanoid matching and (III) motion imitation based
on reinforcement learning (RL). Stage I introduces a test time adaptation
strategy, which improves the physical plausibility of synthesized human
skeleton motions by optimizing skeleton joint locations. Stage II performs an
analytical inverse kinematics strategy, which converts the optimized human
skeleton motions to humanoid robot motions in a physics simulator, then the
converted humanoid robot motions can be served as reference motions for the RL
policy to imitate. Stage III introduces a curriculum residual force control
policy, which drives the humanoid robot to mimic complex converted reference
motions in accordance with the physical law. We verify our system on a typical
human motion synthesis task, motion-in-betweening. Experiments on the
challenging LaFAN1 dataset show our system can outperform prior methods
significantly in terms of both physical plausibility and accuracy. Code will be

formulate a platooning coordination problem and study whether trucks waiting at

negative light sources immersed in homogeneous media, which was described using
diffuse approximation. The contrast ratio was used as an image quality metric.
Results: We have developed the single point subsurface defect model and
extended it to horizontally- and vertically-arranged linear inhomogeneities. In

extensively tested on offline image classification and regression tasks. In
this paper, we study these vision architectures with respect to the open-loop

closed-loop deployment. This causality gap typically emerges in robotics
applications such as autonomous driving, where a network is trained to imitate
the control commands of a human. In this setting, two situations arise: 1)
Closed-loop testing in-distribution, where the test environment shares
properties with those of offline training data. 2) Closed-loop testing under
distribution shifts and out-of-distribution. Contrary to recently reported
results, we show that under proper training guidelines, all vision models
perform indistinguishably well on in-distribution deployment, resolving the
causality gap. In situation 2, We observe that the causality gap disrupts
performance regardless of the choice of the model architecture. Our results
imply that the causality gap can be solved in situation one with our proposed
training guideline with any modern network architecture, whereas achieving
out-of-distribution generalization (situation two) requires further
investigations, for instance, on data diversity rather than the model

architecture for quantum-secured FEL systems with ideal security based on the
quantum key distribution (QKD) to facilitate public key and model encryption
against eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, we propose a stochastic resource
allocation model for efficient QKD to encrypt FEL keys and models. In FEL
systems, remote FEL workers are connected to cluster heads via quantum-secured
channels to train an aggregated global model collaboratively. However, due to
the unpredictable number of workers at each location, the demand for secret-key
rates to support secure model transmission to the server is unpredictable. The
proposed systems need to efficiently allocate limited QKD resources (i.e.,
wavelengths) such that the total cost is minimized in the presence of
stochastic demand by formulating the optimization problem for the proposed
architecture as a stochastic programming model. To this end, we propose a
federated reinforcement learning-based resource allocation scheme to solve the
proposed model without complete state information. The proposed scheme enables
QKD managers and controllers to train a global QKD resource allocation policy
while keeping their private experiences local. Numerical results demonstrate
that the proposed schemes can successfully achieve the cost-minimizing
objective under uncertain demand while improving the training efficiency by
about 50\% compared to state-of-the-art schemes.

(mmWave) band Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) system adopting a
realistic hybrid digital-analog (HDA) architecture. To maintain a desired SNR
level, initial beam acquisition (BA) must be established prior to data
transmission. In the considered setup, a Base Station (BS) Tx transmits data
via a digitally modulated waveform and a co-located radar receiver
simultaneously performs radar estimation from the backscattered signal. In this
BA scheme, a single common data stream is broadcast over a wide angular sector
such that the radar receiver can detect the presence of not yet acquired users
and perform coarse parameter estimation (angle of arrival, time of flight, and
Doppler). As a result of the HDA architecture, we consider the design of
multi-block adaptive RF-domain 'reduction matrices' (from antennas to RF
chains) at the radar receiver, to achieve a compromise between the exploration
capability in the angular domain and the directivity of the beamforming
patterns. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able
to reliably detect multiple targets while significantly reducing the initial
acquisition time.

nanoscale fabrication. It has recently been employed to tailor defect
engineering in functional nanomaterials such as two-dimensional transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), providing desirable properties in TMDC-based
optoelectronic devices. However, the damage caused by the FIB irradiation and
milling process to these delicate atomically thin materials, especially in the
extended area, has not yet been elaboratively characterised. Understanding the
correlation between lateral ion beam effects and optical properties of 2D TMDCs
is crucial in designing and fabricating high-performance optoelectronic
devices. In this work, we investigate lateral damage in large-area monolayer
WS2 caused by the gallium focused ion beam milling process. Three distinct
zones away from the milling location are identified and characterised via
steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectroscopy. An unexpected
bright ring-shaped emission around the milled location has been revealed by
time-resolved PL spectroscopy with high spatial resolution. Our finding opens
new avenues for tailoring the optical properties of TMDCs by charge and defect
engineering via focused ion beam lithography. Furthermore, our study provides
evidence that while some localised damage is inevitable, distant destruction
can be eliminated by reducing the ion beam current. It paves the way for the
use of FIB to create nanostructures in 2D TMDCs, as well as the design and

Trace Gas Orbiter returns on average twenty images per day of the Martian

a push-frame approach to acquire colour images, with four bandpass filters
deposited directly above the sensor and an imaging cadence synchronized with
the ground track velocity to cover the imaged area with tens of small,
partially overlapping images. These ""framelets"" are later map-projected and
mosaicked to build the final image. This approach offers both advantages and
challenges in terms of radiometric calibration. While the collection of dark
and flatfield frames is considerably enhanced by the frequent and fast
acquisition of tens of successive images, mosaics assembled from the adjacent
framelets highlight the straylight and changes in the bias of the detector.
Both issues have been identified on CaSSIS images, with low intensities overall
(up to a few percents), but sufficient to generate prominent artefacts on the
final assembled colour images. We have therefore developed methods to correct
these artefacts that are now included into the radiometric calibration
pipeline. We detail here the different steps of the calibration procedure and
the generation of the products used for calibration, and discuss the efficacy
of the corrections. The relative uncertainties on the bias and flatfield frames
are low, of the order of 0.2 and 0.1 percents, respectively. The uncertainty on
the absolute radiometric calibration is of 3 percents, which is quite low for
such an instrument. The straylight adds an estimated about 1 percent error to
the absolute calibration. The residuals after corrections of the straylight and
bias offsets are of the order of a few DNs to tens of DNs.

""marginal value of adaptive methods"" in standard tasks, it remains unclear why
they are still critical for GAN training. In this paper, we formally study how
adaptive methods help train GANs; inspired by the grafting method proposed in
arXiv:2002.11803 [cs.LG], we separate the magnitude and direction components of
the Adam updates, and graft them to the direction and magnitude of SGDA updates
respectively. By considering an update rule with the magnitude of the Adam
update and the normalized direction of SGD, we empirically show that the
adaptive magnitude of Adam is key for GAN training. This motivates us to have a
closer look at the class of normalized stochastic gradient descent ascent
(nSGDA) methods in the context of GAN training. We propose a synthetic
theoretical framework to compare the performance of nSGDA and SGDA for GAN
training with neural networks. We prove that in that setting, GANs trained with
nSGDA recover all the modes of the true distribution, whereas the same networks
trained with SGDA (and any learning rate configuration) suffer from mode
collapse. The critical insight in our analysis is that normalizing the
gradients forces the discriminator and generator to be updated at the same
pace. We also experimentally show that for several datasets, Adam's performance
can be recovered with nSGDA methods.

evaluates a question by computing the cross entropy according to the

other metrics can correlate with human judgements. Experiments show that
QAScore obtains a stronger correlation with the results of our proposed human

interactions. Standard models -- CNNs, Vision Transformers, etc. -- which

further by employing additional modalities such as object detections, optical
flow, audio, etc. as input. The added complexity of the required
modality-specific modules, on the other hand, makes these models impractical
for deployment. The goal of this work is to retain the performance of such
multimodal approaches, while using only the RGB images as input at inference
time. Our approach is based on multimodal knowledge distillation, featuring a
multimodal teacher (in the current experiments trained only using object
detections, optical flow and RGB frames) and a unimodal student (using only RGB
frames as input). We present preliminary results which demonstrate that the
resulting model -- distilled from a multimodal teacher -- significantly
outperforms the baseline RGB model (trained without knowledge distillation), as
well as an omnivorous version of itself (trained on all modalities jointly), in
both standard and compositional action recognition.

graphs that are equipped with provable guarantees on the false discovery rate
(FDR). We consider the setting where distinct agents reside on the nodes of an
undirected graph, and each agent possesses p-values corresponding to one or
more hypotheses local to its node. Each agent must individually decide whether
to reject one or more of its local hypotheses by only communicating with its
neighbors, with the joint aim that the global FDR over the entire graph must be
controlled at a predefined level. We propose a simple decentralized family of
Query-Test-Exchange (QuTE) algorithms and prove that they can control FDR under
independence or positive dependence of the p-values. Our algorithm reduces to
the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) algorithm when after graph-diameter rounds of
communication, and to the Bonferroni procedure when no communication has
occurred or the graph is empty. To avoid communicating real-valued p-values, we
develop a quantized BH procedure, and extend it to a quantized QuTE procedure.
QuTE works seamlessly in streaming data settings, where anytime-valid p-values
may be continually updated at each node. Last, QuTE is robust to arbitrary
dropping of packets, or a graph that changes at every step, making it
particularly suitable to mobile sensor networks involving drones or other
multi-agent systems. We study the power of our procedure using a simulation
suite of different levels of connectivity and communication on a variety of
graph structures, and also provide an illustrative real-world example.

periodic array of B\'enard-K\`arm\`an vortices in a $2$-meter long narrow water
channel is experimentally investigated here. The vortex shedding frequency
$f_v$ is varied via the mean flow speed $U_0$ and the cylinder diameter $d_0 =
10$, $20$ and $40$ mm, while the structures' bending resistance is controlled
via its Young's modulus $E$, thickness $e_b$ and length $L_b$. It is first
demonstrated that the non-dimensional time-averaged sheet deflection, namely,
the sheet \textit{reconfiguration} $\bar{h}_b/L_b \sim C_y^{\mathcal{V}/2}$.
Here, $\mathcal{V} \leq 0$ is the well-known Vogel number for flexible
structures in a steady flow and $C_y = 12 \left({C_d \frac{1}{2} \rho

elastic restoring force, if the sheet were rigid. Despite strong resemblances
to the case without vortices, our results show that the presence of vortices
hinder the average reconfiguration effect due to the velocity defect in the
cylinder wake and, also by increasing the Vogel number. Measurements and a
simple model based on torsional-spring-mounted flat plate illustrate that the
tip amplitude $\delta_b$ is not only directly proportional to the
characteristic size of the eddies, say $d_v$, but also to the sheet mechanical
properties and the vortex flow characteristics such that $\delta_b/d_v \sim
C_y^{(1+\mathcal{V})/2} \sqrt{U_0/f_v d_v}$. Furthermore, a rich phenomenology
of structural dynamics including vortex-forced-vibration, lock-in with the
sheet natural frequency, flow-induced vibration due to the sheet wake,
multiple-frequency and modal response is reported.

While template evaluation can be a convenient and helpful diagnostic tool to
understand model deficiencies, it often uses a simplistic and limited set of
templates. In this paper, we study whether bias measurements are sensitive to
the choice of templates used for benchmarking. Specifically, we investigate the
instability of bias measurements by manually modifying templates proposed in
previous works in a semantically-preserving manner and measuring bias across
these modifications. We find that bias values and resulting conclusions vary
considerably across template modifications on four tasks, ranging from an 81%
reduction (NLI) to a 162% increase (MLM) in (task-specific) bias measurements.
Our results indicate that quantifying fairness in LLMs, as done in current
practice, can be brittle and needs to be approached with more care and caution.

extends the local extreme learning machine technique originally developed for

determines the inverse parameters and the trainable network parameters all
together by the nonlinear least squares method with perturbations
(NLLSQ-perturb). The second algorithm (VarPro-F1) eliminates the inverse
parameters from the overall problem by variable projection to attain a reduced
problem about the trainable network parameters only. It solves the reduced
problem first by the NLLSQ-perturb algorithm for the trainable network

other in a sense. The presented method produces accurate results for inverse
PDE problems, as shown by the numerical examples herein. For noise-free data,
the errors for the inverse parameters and the solution field decrease
exponentially as the number of collocation points or the number of trainable
network parameters increases, and can reach a level close to the machine
accuracy. For noisy data, the accuracy degrades compared with the case of

allowing the exchange of digital assets via blockchains. NFTs have also been
adopted by artists to sell digital art. One of the promises of NFTs is
broadening participation to the arts market, a traditionally closed and opaque
system, to sustain a wider and more diverse set of artists and collectors. A
key sign of this effect would be the disappearance or at least reduction in
importance of seller-buyer preferential ties, whereby the success of an artist
is strongly dependent on the patronage of a single collector. We investigate
NFT art seller-buyer networks considering several galleries and a large set of
nearly 40,000 sales for over 230M USD in total volume. We find that NFT art is
a highly concentrated market driven by few successful sellers and even fewer
systematic buyers. High concentration is present in both the number of sales
and, even more strongly, in their priced volume. Furthermore, we show that,
while a broader-participation market was present in the early phase of NFT art
adoption, preferential ties have dominated during market growth, peak and
recent decline. We consistently find that the top buyer accounts on average for
over 80% of buys for a given seller. Similar trends apply to buyers and their
top seller. We conclude that NFT art constitutes, at the present, a highly
concentrated market driven by preferential seller-buyer ties.

we uncover parameter regimes with new types of stable fixed points that are
distinct from the single- and dual-population equilibria characteristic of the

maintain heteroclinic connections that exist in the original system. In short,
a linear perturbation proves to be significant enough to substantially
influence the dynamics, even with small mutation rates.

When obstacles are static, a sharp transition between confined motion and free

test if this conventional wisdom continues to hold in the presence of simple
tracer-media interactions, we introduce the Sokoban random walk. Akin to the
protagonist of an eponymous video game, the Sokoban has some ability to push
away obstacles that block its path. While one expects this will allow the
Sokoban to venture further away, we surprisingly find that this is not always
the case. Indeed, as it moves $\unicode{x2013}$ pushing obstacles around
$\unicode{x2013}$ the Sokoban always confines itself to a finite region whose
mean size is uniquely determined by the initial obstacle density. Consequently,
the percolation transition is lost. This finding breaks from the ruling ""ant in

Plane performed at very-high-energy gamma-rays. Consequently, this survey will
unavoidably face the challenge of source confusion, i.e., the non-unique
attribution of signal to a source due to multiple overlapping sources. Among
the known populations of Galactic gamma-ray sources and given their extension
and number, pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe, and PWN TeV halos) will be the most
affected. We aim to probe source confusion of TeV PWNe in forthcoming CTA data.
For this purpose, we performed and analyzed simulations of artificially
confused PWNe with CTA. As a basis for our simulations, we applied our study to
TeV data collected from the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey for ten extended and
two point-like firmly identified PWNe, probing various configurations of source
confusion involving different projected separations, relative orientations,
flux levels, and extensions among sources. Source confusion, defined here to
appear when the sum of the Gaussian width of two sources is larger than the
separation between their centroids, occurred in $\sim$30% of the simulations.
For this sample and 0.5$\deg$ of average separation between sources, we found
that CTA can likely resolve up to 60% of those confused sources above 500 GeV.
Finally, we also considered simulations of isolated extended sources to see how
well they could be matched to a library of morphological templates. The outcome
of the simulations indicates a remarkable capability (more than 95% of the
cases studied) to match a simulation with the correct input template in its
proper orientation.

CNO elements - are the most abundant species in the universe. They are observed
in all kinds of astrophysical environments, from the smallest to the largest
scales, and are at the basis of all known forms of life, hence, the
constituents of any biomarker. As such, their study proves crucial in several
areas of contemporary astrophysics, extending to astrobiology. In this review,
I will summarize current knowledge about CNO element evolution in galaxies,
starting from our home, the Milky Way. After a brief recap of CNO synthesis in
stars, I will present the comparison between chemical evolution model
predictions and observations of CNO isotopic abundances and abundance ratios in
stars and in gaseous matter. Such a comparison permits to constrain the modes
and time scales of the assembly of galaxies and their stellar populations, as
well as stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis theories. I will stress that
chemical evolution models must be carefully calibrated against the wealth of
abundance data available for the Milky Way before they can be applied to the
interpretation of observational datasets for other systems. In this vein, I
will also discuss the usefulness of some key CNO isotopic ratios as probes of
the prevailing, galaxy-wide stellar initial mass function in galaxies where
more direct estimates from starlight are unfeasible.

decentralized manner with those in their vicinity, agents trained with
expectation alignment learn behaviors that match their neighbors' expectations.
This allows the agents to learn collaborative behaviors without any external

across 6 tasks in the multi-agent particle and the complex Google Research

rewards. When the number of agents increases, ELIGN scales well in all
multi-agent tasks except for one where agents have different capabilities. We
show that agent coordination improves through expectation alignment because
agents learn to divide tasks amongst themselves, break coordination symmetries,
and confuse adversaries. These results identify tasks where expectation
alignment is a more useful strategy than curiosity-driven exploration for
multi-agent coordination, enabling agents to do zero-shot coordination.

$d/u \rightarrow 1/6$. Our extrapolated values for both the
$\frac{F_2^n}{F_2^p}$ ratio and the $d/u$ parton distribution function ratio
most closely match perturbative QCD values from quark counting and helicity

theoretical predictions may be ameliorated if two compatible models act
simultaneously in the nucleon wavefunction. One such example is nucleon
wavefunctions composed of a linear combination of a quark-diquark state and a
3-valence quark correlated state with coefficients that combine to give the
extrapolated $F_2$ ratio of $0.4$.

  Answering over Knowledge Graphs","31st ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge
  Management (CIKM 2022)",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper addresses the task of conversational question answering (ConvQA)
over knowledge graphs (KGs). The majority of existing ConvQA methods rely on
full supervision signals with a strict assumption of the availability of gold
logical forms of queries to extract answers from the KG. However, creating such
a gold logical form is not viable for each potential question in a real-world
scenario. Hence, in the case of missing gold logical forms, the existing
information retrieval-based approaches use weak supervision via heuristics or
reinforcement learning, formulating ConvQA as a KG path ranking problem.
Despite missing gold logical forms, an abundance of conversational contexts,
such as entire dialog history with fluent responses and domain information, can
be incorporated to effectively reach the correct KG path. This work proposes a
contrastive representation learning-based approach to rank KG paths
effectively. Our approach solves two key challenges. Firstly, it allows weak
supervision-based learning that omits the necessity of gold annotations.
Second, it incorporates the conversational context (entire dialog history and
domain information) to jointly learn its homogeneous representation with KG
paths to improve contrastive representations for effective path ranking. We
evaluate our approach on standard datasets for ConvQA, on which it
significantly outperforms existing baselines on all domains and overall.
Specifically, in some cases, the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@5 ranking
metrics improve by absolute 10 and 18 points, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art performance.

derive an analytic expression for the efficiency of any dissipative molecular

expression disentangles the chemical potential from the machine's details,
whose effect on the efficiency is fully specified by a constant called the load
resistance. The efficiency passes through a switch-like inflection point if the
balance between chemical potential and load resistance exceeds thermal noise.
Therefore, dissipative chemical engines qualitatively differ from heat engines,

This work investigated the dosimetric quality of Galaxy by comparing both the
machine treatment parameters and plan dosimetry parameters with those of the
widely used Leksell Gamma Knife (LGK) systems for SRS. Methods: The Galaxy RTi
system uses 30 cobalt-60 sources on a rotating gantry to deliver non-coplanar,
non-overlapping arcs simultaneously while the LGK 4C uses 201 static cobalt-60
sources to deliver noncoplanar beams. Ten brain cancer patients were unarchived
from our clinical database, which were previously treated on the LGK 4C. The
lesion volume for these cases varied from 0.1 cm3 to 15.4 cm3. Galaxy plans
were generated using the Prowess TPS (Prowess, Concord, CA) with the same dose
constraints and optimization parameters. Treatment quality metrics such as
target coverage (%volume receiving the prescription dose), conformity index
(CI), cone size, shots number, beam-on time were compared together with DVH
curves and dose distributions. Results: Superior treatment plans were generated
for the Galaxy system that met our clinical acceptance criteria. For the 10
patients investigated, the mean CI and dose coverage for Galaxy was 1.77 and
99.24 compared to 1.94 and 99.19 for LGK, respectively. The beam-on time for
Galaxy was 17.42 minutes compared to 21.34 minutes for LGK (both assuming dose
rates at the initial installation). The dose fall-off is much faster for
Galaxy, compared with LGK. Conclusion: The Galaxy RTi system can provide dose
distributions with similar quality to that of LGK with less beam-on time and
faster dose fall-off. The system is also capable of real-time image guidance at

topologically non-trivial. We first consider the case of weak out-of-cell
coupling, corresponding to the topologically trivial regime for linear SSH; for
any prescribed isolated dimer frequency, $\omega_b$, which satisfies
non-resonance and non-degeneracy assumptions, we prove that there are discrete
breather solutions for sufficiently small values of the out-of-cell coupling
parameter. These states are $2\pi/\omega_b$- periodic in time and exponentially
localized in space. We then study the global continuation with respect to this

discrete breather frequency, is in the (coupling dependent) phonon gap of the
underlying linear infinite array. As the coupling is increased, the phonon gap
decreases in width and tends to a point (at which the topological transition
for linear SSH occurs). In this limit, the spatial scale of the discrete
breather grows and its amplitude decreases, indicating the weakly nonlinear
long wave regime. Asymptotic analysis shows that in this regime the discrete
breather envelope is determined by a vector gap soliton of the limiting
envelope equations. We use the envelope theory to describe discrete breathers
for SSH- coupling parameters corresponding to topologically trivial and, by
exploiting an emergent symmetry, topologically nontrivial regimes, when the
spectral gap is small. Our asymptotic theory shows excellent agreement with

that the combination of these two objectives ultimately provides the best
results. We analyze three cases in plane strain conditions, namely (i)
double-edged crack and (ii) center crack in tension and (iii) edge crack under
shear. Each case evidences a different optimal topology with (i) and (ii)
providing similar results. The optimal topology allocates stiffness in regions
that are far away from the crack tip, intuitively, but the allocation of softer
materials over stiffer ones can be non-trivial. To test our solutions, we plot
the contact stress distribution across the interface. In all observed cases, we
eliminate the stress singularity at the crack tip. Stress concentrations might
arise in locations far away from the crack tip, but the final results are
independent of crack size. Our method ultimately provides optimal, flaw
tolerant, adhesives where the crack location is known.

scale PCs to model large and high-dimensional real-world datasets: we observe
that as the number of parameters in PCs increases, their performance
immediately plateaus. This phenomenon suggests that the existing optimizers
fail to exploit the full expressive power of large PCs. We propose to overcome
such bottleneck by latent variable distillation: we leverage the less tractable

Transformer-based generative models to assign values to latent variables of

polarisation features, such as high levels of circular polarisation or a sign
change of circular polarisation. High linear polarisation would appear when the
line of sight is inside the emission beam (the on-beam geometry), whereas high
circular polarisation would be present when it is outside (the off-beam

that they evolve over time. Furthermore, graphs usually contain multi-aspect
information i.e. in a social network, we can have the ""means of communication""
between nodes, such as who messages whom, who calls whom, and who comments on
whose timeline and so on.
  How can we model and mine useful patterns, such as communities of nodes in
that graph, from such multi-aspect graphs? How can we identify dynamic patterns
in those graphs, and how can we deal with streaming data, when the volume of
data to be processed is very large? In order to answer those questions, in this
thesis, we propose novel tensor-based methods for mining static and dynamic
multi-aspect graphs. In general, a tensor is a higher-order generalization of a
matrix that can represent high-dimensional multi-aspect data such as
time-evolving networks, collaboration networks, and spatio-temporal data like
Electroencephalography (EEG) brain measurements.
  The thesis is organized in two synergistic thrusts: First, we focus on static
multi-aspect graphs, where the goal is to identify coherent communities and
patterns between nodes by leveraging the tensor structure in the data. Second,
as our graphs evolve dynamically, we focus on handling such streaming updates
in the data without having to re-compute the decomposition, but incrementally
update the existing results.

Crowdsensing (MCS) networks calls for the new design of responsive and seamless

conventional onsite spot trading of resources based on real-time network
conditions and decisions can facilitate the data sharing over MCS networks, it
often suffers from prohibitively long service provisioning delays and
unavoidable trading failures due to its reliance on timely analysis of complex
and dynamic MCS environments. These limitations motivate us to investigate an
integrated forward and spot trading mechanism (iFAST), which entails a new
hybrid service trading protocol over the MCS network architecture. In iFAST,
the sellers (i.e., mobile users with sensing resources) can provide long-term
or temporary sensing services to the buyers (i.e., sensing task owners). iFast
enables signing long-term contracts in advance of future transactions through a
forward trading mode, via analyzing historical statistics of the market, for
which the notion of overbooking is introduced and promoted. iFAST further
enables the buyers with unsatisfying service quality to recruit temporary
sellers through a spot trading mode, upon considering the current
market/network conditions. We analyze the fundamental blocks of iFAST, and
provide a case study to demonstrate its superior performance as compared to
existing methods. Finally, future research directions on reliable service

the surface of the two dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^{2}$. Due to the
geometric effects induced by the $\mathbb{S}^{2}$ curvature, such correlations
collude with specific dynamics (\emph{navigation strategies}) on the manifold
topology to originate rich transport properties. We focus our study to two
classes of navigation strategies: One induced by the specific set of
coordinates chosen for $\mathbb{S}^2$ which defines a fixed frame of reference;
in particular, we chose the basis induced by spherical coordinates. We find
that contrary to what occurs in the absence of correlations non-equilibrium
stationary distributions are attained. We elucidate an analogy of our results
with those observed of fractional Brownian motion in confined by reflecting
walls in one and two dimensions. In contrast, when the navigation strategy
chosen corresponds to a frame of reference moving with the particle as does the
Frenet-Serret system, then the equilibrium uniform distribution on the sphere
is attained. In both cases, the relaxation times towards the stationary
distribution depend on the particular value of the Hurst parameter. We show
that scaled Brownian motion on $\mathbb{S}^2$ is independent of the navigation
strategy and we find a good agreement between the analytical calculations

well-performed neural network (the {\it teacher}) to a weaker one (the {\it

necessarily teach better, and temperature adjustment can neither alleviate the
mismatched capacity. To explain this, we decompose the efficacy of KD into
three parts: {\it correct guidance}, {\it smooth regularization}, and {\it
class discriminability}. The last term describes the distinctness of {\it wrong

be over-confident and traditional temperature scaling limits the efficacy of
{\it class discriminability}, resulting in less discriminative wrong class
probabilities. Therefore, we propose {\it Asymmetric Temperature Scaling
(ATS)}, which separately applies a higher/lower temperature to the
correct/wrong class. ATS enlarges the variance of wrong class probabilities in

paper, we question whether the complexity of these models is needed to achieve
good performance by comparing them to a simple baseline that we designed. We
argue that the pretrained feature extractor itself can be strong enough to
achieve a competitive or even better continual learning performance on
Split-CIFAR100 and CoRe 50 benchmarks. To validate this, we conduct a very
simple baseline that 1) use the frozen pretrained model to extract image
features for every class encountered during the continual learning stage and
compute their corresponding mean features on training data, and 2) predict the
class of the input based on the nearest neighbor distance between test samples

from low dynamic range (LDR) and low frame per second (FPS) outputs. Previous
works in high dynamic range (HDR) video reconstruction uses sequence of
alternating exposure LDR frames as input, and align the neighbouring frames
using optical flow based networks. However, these methods often result in
motion artifacts in challenging situations. This is because, the alternate
exposure frames have to be exposure matched in order to apply alignment using
optical flow. Hence, over-saturation and noise in the LDR frames results in
inaccurate alignment. To this end, we propose to align the input LDR frames
using a pre-trained video frame interpolation network. This results in better
alignment of LDR frames, since we circumvent the error-prone exposure matching
step, and directly generate intermediate missing frames from the same exposure

recursively interpolating the intermediate frames. Through this work, we

internal stresses and deformations in complex fluids -- is a critical step in
the engineering of systems involving soft materials. While data-driven models
provide accessible alternatives to expensive first-principles models and less
accurate empirical models in many engineering disciplines, the development of
similar models for complex fluids has lagged. The diversity of techniques for
characterizing non-Newtonian fluid dynamics creates a challenge for classical
machine learning approaches, which require uniformly structured training data.
Consequently, early machine learning constitutive equations have not been
portable between different deformation protocols or mechanical observables.
Here, we present a data-driven framework that resolves such issues, allowing
rheologists to construct learnable models that incorporate essential physical
information, while remaining agnostic to details regarding particular
experimental protocols or flow kinematics. These scientific machine learning
models incorporate a universal approximator within a materially objective
tensorial constitutive framework. By construction, these models respect
physical constraints, such as frame-invariance and tensor symmetry, required by
continuum mechanics. We demonstrate that this framework facilitates the rapid
discovery of accurate constitutive equations from limited data, and that the
learned models may be used to describe more kinematically complex flows. This
inherent flexibility admits the application of these 'digital fluid twins' to a
range of material systems and engineering problems. We illustrate this
flexibility by deploying a trained model within a multidimensional
computational fluid dynamics simulation -- a task that is not achievable using

goalkeeping using quadrupeds is a challenging problem, that combines highly
dynamic locomotion with precise and fast non-prehensile object (ball)
manipulation. The robot needs to react to and intercept a potentially flying
ball using dynamic locomotion maneuvers in a very short amount of time, usually
less than one second. In this paper, we propose to address this problem using a
hierarchical model-free RL framework. The first component of the framework
contains multiple control policies for distinct locomotion skills, which can be
used to cover different regions of the goal. Each control policy enables the
robot to track random parametric end-effector trajectories while performing one
specific locomotion skill, such as jump, dive, and sidestep. These skills are
then utilized by the second part of the framework which is a high-level planner
to determine a desired skill and end-effector trajectory in order to intercept
a ball flying to different regions of the goal. We deploy the proposed
framework on a Mini Cheetah quadrupedal robot and demonstrate the effectiveness
of our framework for various agile interceptions of a fast-moving ball in the
real world.

learning (MBDL) as a method to reconstruct free breathing, 3D Pulmonary
ultrashort echo time (UTE) acquisitions.
  Theory and Methods: A self-supervised eXtra Dimension MBDL architecture
(XD-MBDL) was developed that combined respiratory states to reconstruct a
single high-quality 3D image. Non-rigid, GPU based motion fields were
incorporated into this architecture by estimating motion fields from a low
resolution motion resolved (XD-GRASP) iterative reconstruction. Motion
Compensated XD-MBDL was evaluated on lung UTE datasets with and without
contrast and was compared to constrained reconstructions and variants of
self-supervised MBDL that do not consider respiratory motion.
  Results: Images reconstructed using XD-MBDL demonstrate improved image
quality as measured by apparent SNR, CNR and visual assessment relative to
self-supervised MBDL approaches that do not account for dynamic respiratory
states, XD-GRASP and a recently proposed motion compensated iterative
reconstruction strategy (iMoCo). Additionally, XD-MBDL reduced reconstruction
time relative to both XD-GRASP and iMoCo.
  Conclusion: A method was developed to allow self-supervised MBDL to combine
multiple respiratory states to reconstruct a single image. This method was
combined with GPU-based image registration to further improve reconstruction
quality. This approach showed promising results reconstructing a user-selected
respiratory phase from free breathing 3D pulmonary UTE acquisitions.

Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey in the same field. We derive the
evolution of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, finding a steeper
specific star formation rate versus stellar mass at $z>2.5$ than previous
studies. Most faint submillimeter-galaxies fall within $3\sigma$ of the main
sequence, but 40~per cent are classified as starbursts. Faint submillimeter
galaxies have 50~per cent larger sizes at $2<z<3$ than optically-selected
star-forming galaxies of the same mass range. This is also the redshift bin
where we find the largest fraction of starbursts, and hence we could be
witnessing merging processes, as confirmed by the preference for
visual-morphology classifications of these systems as irregular disk galaxies
and mergers. Both populations show an increment towards lower redshifts ($z<2$)
of their concentration in $H$-band morphology, but faint submillimeter galaxies
on average show larger concentration values at later times. These findings
support the claim that faint submillimeter galaxies are mostly a population of
massive dust-obscured disk-like galaxies that develop larger bulge components
at later epochs. While the similarities are great, the median sizes, starburst
numbers and $H$-band concentration of faint submillimeter galaxies differ from
those of optically-selected star-forming galaxies of the same stellar mass.

for a variety of applications, such as gas separations, water desalination, and
DNA sequencing. So far, however, all plausible isomeric shapes of graphene
nanopores have not been enumerated. Instead, a probabilistic approach has been
followed to predict nanopore shapes in 2D materials, due to the exponential
increase in the number of nanopores as the size of the vacancy increases. For
example, there are 12 possible isomers when N=6 atoms are removed, a number
that theoretically increases to 11.7 million when N=20 atoms are removed from
the graphene lattice. The development of a smaller, exhaustive dataset of
stable nanopore shapes can help future experimental and theoretical studies
focused on using nanoporous 2D materials in various applications. In this work,
we use the theory of 2D triangular ""lattice animals"" to create a library of all
stable graphene nanopore shapes based on a modification of a well-known
algorithm in the mathematical combinatorics of polyforms known as Redelmeier's
algorithm. We show that there exists a correspondence between graphene
nanopores and triangular polyforms (called polyiamonds) as well as hexagonal
polyforms (called polyhexes). We develop the concept of a polyiamond ID to
identify unique nanopore isomers. We also use concepts from polyiamond and
polyhex geometry to eliminate unstable nanopores containing dangling atoms,
bonds, and moieties. The exclusion of such unstable nanopores leads to a
remarkable reduction in the possible nanopores from 11.7 million for N=20 to
only 0.184 million nanopores, thereby indicating that the number of stable
nanopores is almost two orders of magnitude lower and is much more tractable.
Not only that, by extracting the polyhex outline, our algorithm allows
searching for nanopores with dimensions and shape factors in a specified range.

algorithms including various state-of-the-art methods mainly in spatial
clustering, spatially variable gene identification, and alignment. While great
progress has been made in developing deep learning-based models for SRT data
analysis, further improvement is still needed to create more biologically aware
models that consider aspects such as phylogeny-aware clustering or the analysis
of small histology image patches. Additionally, strategies for batch effect
removal, normalization, and handling overdispersion and zero inflation patterns
of gene expression are still needed in the analysis of SRT data using deep
learning methods. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of these
deep learning methods, including their strengths and limitations. We also
highlight new frontiers, current challenges, limitations, and open questions in
this field. Also, we provide a comprehensive list of all available SRT
databases that can be used as an extensive resource for future studies.

method, called OGC, to simultaneously identify multiple 3D objects in a single
forward pass, without needing any type of human annotations. The key to our
approach is to fully leverage the dynamic motion patterns over sequential point
clouds as supervision signals to automatically discover rigid objects. Our
method consists of three major components, 1) the object segmentation network
to directly estimate multi-object masks from a single point cloud frame, 2) the
auxiliary self-supervised scene flow estimator, and 3) our core object geometry
consistency component. By carefully designing a series of loss functions, we
effectively take into account the multi-object rigid consistency and the object
shape invariance in both temporal and spatial scales. This allows our method to
truly discover the object geometry even in the absence of annotations. We
extensively evaluate our method on five datasets, demonstrating the superior
performance for object part instance segmentation and general object
segmentation in both indoor and the challenging outdoor scenarios.

the action of a small-scale dynamo (SSD) in the interstellar medium (ISM) of

turbulent driving of the SSD. Here we analyze more realistic simulations of
supernova-driven turbulence to understand how it drives an SSD. We find that
SSD growth rates are intermittently variable as a result of the evolving
multiphase ISM structure. Rapid growth in the magnetic field typically occurs
in hot gas, with the highest overall growth rates occurring when the fractional
volume of hot gas is large. SSD growth rates correlate most strongly with
vorticity and fluid Reynolds number, which also both correlate strongly with
gas temperature. Rotational energy exceeds irrotational energy in all phases,
but particularly in the hot phase while SSD growth is most rapid. Supernova
(SN) rate does not significantly affect the ISM average kinetic energy density.
Rather, higher temperatures associated with high SN rates tend to increase SSD
growth rates. SSD saturates with total magnetic energy density around 5% of
equipartition to kinetic energy density, increasing slightly with magnetic
Prandtl number. While magnetic energy density in the hot gas can exceed that of
the other phases when SSD grows most rapidly, it saturates below 5% of
equipartition with kinetic energy in the hot gas, while in the cold gas it
attains 100%. Fast, intermittent growth of the magnetic field appears to be a
characteristic behavior of SN-driven, multiphase turbulence.

simulation of flares. Detailed calculations could be computationally expensive,
especially in the chromosphere. There have been some approximate recipes for
chromospheric radiative losses in flares, yet their feasibility in flare
simulations needs further evaluation.
  Aims. We aim to evaluate the performance of different recipes for
chromospheric radiative losses in flare simulations.
  Methods. We compare the atmospheric structure and line profiles in
beam-heated flares calculated with detailed radiative losses and the
approximate recipes.
  Results. Both GF90 and HCD22 recipes provide acceptable total radiative
losses compared with detailed one, but there are discrepancies in the different
atmospheric layers during the different evolutionary phases, which leads to
misestimations of temperature and line intensity. The recipe of GF90
overestimates the coolings in the upper chromosphere greatly when temperature
exceeds 10^5 K, which also affects the flare evolution and line asymmetries.
Radiative heating in the middle chromosphere only functions in the initial
stage and could be safely neglected. However, radiative heating from Lyman
continuum could dominate near the transition region.

to be observed, but these observations suggest that target variability is an
unlikely cause of the candidate transit. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo

rates, we should have roughly a 1$\%$ chance of detecting a candidate that

In this study, density functional theory (DFT) that accounts for van der Waals

of the I ion from the Pb-I-Pb alignment by the effect of the MA molecule breaks

solving the task of uncertainty-aware panoptic segmentation using LiDAR point
clouds. Our proposed EvLPSNet network is the first to solve this task
efficiently in a sampling-free manner. It aims to predict per-point semantic

Moreover, it incorporates methods for improving the performance by employing
the predicted uncertainties. We provide several strong baselines combining
state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation networks with sampling-free uncertainty
estimation techniques. Extensive evaluations show that we achieve the best
performance on uncertainty-aware panoptic segmentation quality and calibration

we analyze and compare classical security techniques, i.e., physical layer

leading to better generalization and adaptation of the learned model.
Additionally, a softened objective function is implemented by smoothing the
hard labels, which can alleviate the negative effect caused by local
similarities of images between different classes. Experiments with HiCo on five

the responsibility of distributing an ordered stream of transactions to all
nodes of the network in exactly the same way, even in the presence of a certain
amount of malicious parties (byzantine fault tolerance). On the node level,
each node then receives this ordered stream of transactions and executes it
within some sort of transaction processing system, typically to alter some kind
of state. This clear separation into two levels as well as drastically
different application requirements have led to the materialization of the
network level in form of so-called blockchain frameworks. While providing all
the ""blockchain features"", these frameworks leave the node level backend
flexible or even left to be implemented depending on the specific needs of the
application.
  In the following paper, we present how to integrate a highly versatile
transaction processing system, namely a relational DBMS, into such a blockchain
framework. As framework, we use the popular Tendermint Core, now part of the
Ignite/Cosmos eco-system, which can run both public and permissioned networks

pitfalls, we will carefully evaluate the performance implications of such
combinations, in particular, the throughput and latency overhead caused by the
blockchain layer on top of the DBMS. As a result, we give recommendations on
how to run such a systems combination efficiently in practice.

either disproportional limit induces novel phenomena distinct from the

demand extensive eigenvalue shrinkage and offer substantial performance

Conveniently, under the spiked covariance model there is no conflict between
the two and no choice is needed; one unified set of closed forms (used with the
aspect ratio $\gamma_n$ of the practitioner's data) offers full asymptotic
optimality in both regimes. At the heart of these phenomena is the spiked

data. This leads to minimal generation quality loss and improved rectification
performance with acceptable computational cost. Experimental results
demonstrate that compared to several strong baselines, UDDIA achieves debiasing
and detoxifying simultaneously and better balances efficiency and
effectiveness, taking a further step towards practical ethical NLG.

trigger mass loss in their atmospheres are still not fully understood, and
remain one of the key questions in stellar astrophysics. We use a new method to
study the extended atmospheres of these cold stars, exploring the effect of a

compute the intensities, fluxes and visibilities matching the observations for

catastrophic forgetting problem, i.e., the performance of old relations

attributes catastrophic forgetting to the corruption of the learned
representations as new relations come, with an implicit assumption that the CRE
models have adequately learned the old relations. In this paper, through
empirical studies we argue that this assumption may not hold, and an important
reason for catastrophic forgetting is that the learned representations do not
have good robustness against the appearance of analogous relations in the
subsequent learning process. To address this issue, we encourage the model to
learn more precise and robust representations through a simple yet effective

principal components reveal morphological features in molecular emission that
suggest a rotating, infalling disk or envelope, and an outflow analogous to
those seen in Galactic protostars. One particular molecule of astrochemical
interest is methanimine (CH$_2$NH), a precursor to glycine, three transitions

an abundance exceeding $10^{-8}$ relative to molecular hydrogen, using the

highly viscous fluid. By changing the viscosity of the dispersed droplet phase,
we experimentally investigate how the deformability of dispersed droplets
affects the global transport quantity of the turbulent emulsion. Different
kinds of silicone oil are employed to result in the viscosity ratio, $\zeta$,
ranging from $0.53$ to $8.02$. The droplet volume fraction, $\phi$, is varied
from 0\% to 10\% with a spacing of 2\%. The global transport quantity,
quantified by the normalized friction coefficient $c_{f,\phi}/c_{f,\phi=0}$,
shows a weak dependence on the turbulent intensity due to the vanishing
finite-size effect of the droplets. The interesting fact is that, with
increasing $\zeta$, the $c_{f,\phi}/c_{f,\phi=0}$ first increases and then
saturates to a plateau value which is similar to that of the rigid particle
suspension. By performing image analysis, this drag modification is interpreted
from the aspect of droplet deformability, which is responsible for the breakup
and coalescence effect of the droplets. The statistics of the droplet size
distribution show that, with increasing $\zeta$, the stabilizing effect induced
by interfacial tension comes to be substantial and the pure inertial breakup
process becomes dominant. The measurement of the droplet distribution along the
radial direction of the system shows a bulk-clustering effect, which can be
attributed to the non-negligible coalescence effect of the droplet. It is found
that the droplet coalescence effect could be suppressed as the $\zeta$
increases, thereby affecting the contribution of interfacial tension to the
total stress, and accounting for the observed emulsion rheology.

outcomes of collisions between a regular stream of droplets and a continuous

liquid is considered, keeping other material properties unchanged. To do so,
only two liquid types were used: aqueous glycerol solutions for the drop and
different types of silicone oil for the jet liquid. Combining these liquids,
the viscosity ratio {\lambda} = {\mu}drop/{\mu}jet was varied between 0.25 and
3.50. The collision outcomes were classified in the form of regime maps leading
to four main regimes: drops in jet, fragmented drops in jet, encapsulated
drops, and mixed fragmentation.We demonstrate that, depending on the drop and
jet viscosity, not all four regimes can be observed in the domain probed by our
experiments. The experiments reveal that the jet viscosity mainly affects the
transition between drops in jet and encapsulated drops, which is shifted
towards higher drop spacing for more viscous jets. The drop viscosity leaves
the previous transition unchanged but modifies the threshold of the drop
fragmentation within the continuous jet. We develop a model that quantifies how
the drop viscosity affects its extension, which is at first order fixing its
shape during recoil and is, therefore, determining its stability against
pinch-off.

semigroup of scalings and translations have been proposed. However, the
equivariance of subsampling and upsampling has never been explicitly studied
even though they are necessary building blocks in some segmentation
architectures. The U-Net is a representative example of such architectures,
which includes the basic elements used for state-of-the-art semantic

(SEU-Net), a U-Net that is made approximately equivariant to a semigroup of

upsampling layers and the use of aforementioned scale-equivariant layers.
Moreover, a scale-dropout is proposed in order to improve generalization to
different scales in approximately scale-equivariant architectures. The proposed
SEU-Net is trained for semantic segmentation of the Oxford Pet IIIT and the
DIC-C2DH-HeLa dataset for cell segmentation. The generalization metric to
unseen scales is dramatically improved in comparison to the U-Net, even when
the U-Net is trained with scale jittering, and to a scale-equivariant
architecture that does not perform upsampling operators inside the equivariant
pipeline. The scale-dropout induces better generalization on the

each RS image easily accessible, visual question answering (VQA) has been
introduced in RS. VQA allows a user to formulate a free-form question
concerning the content of RS images to extract generic information. It has been
shown that the fusion of the input modalities (i.e., image and text) is crucial
for the performance of VQA systems. Most of the current fusion approaches use
modality-specific representations in their fusion modules instead of joint
representation learning. However, to discover the underlying relation between
both the image and question modality, the model is required to learn the joint
representation instead of simply combining (e.g., concatenating, adding, or
multiplying) the modality-specific representations. We propose a multi-modal
transformer-based architecture to overcome this issue. Our proposed
architecture consists of three main modules: i) the feature extraction module
for extracting the modality-specific features; ii) the fusion module, which
leverages a user-defined number of multi-modal transformer layers of the
VisualBERT model (VB); and iii) the classification module to obtain the answer.
Experimental results obtained on the RSVQAxBEN and RSVQA-LR datasets (which are

VBFusion for VQA tasks in RS. To analyze the importance of using other spectral

continuous and iterative arrival of new data, of which the major challenge is
the catastrophic forgetting of old tasks. In order to alleviate this critical
problem for enhanced CRE performance, we propose a novel Continual Relation
Extraction framework with Contrastive Learning, namely CRECL, which is built
with a classification network and a prototypical contrastive network to achieve
the incremental-class learning of CRE. Specifically, in the contrastive network
a given instance is contrasted with the prototype of each candidate relations
stored in the memory module. Such contrastive learning scheme ensures the data
distributions of all tasks more distinguishable, so as to alleviate the
catastrophic forgetting further. Our experiment results not only demonstrate
our CRECL's advantage over the state-of-the-art baselines on two public

improving CRE performance.

form an unprecedented human-computer interaction experience. Existing panoramic
synthesis methods mainly focus on dealing with the inherent challenges brought
by panoramas' spherical structure such as the projection distortion and the

promising 2D flat images with semantic control, however, it is hard to directly

Besides, both of the above methods can not effectively synthesize

recognize novel classes with only few training samples after the (pre-)training

performance and novel-class generalization. A well known modification to the
base-class training is to apply a margin to the base-class classification.
However, a dilemma exists that we can hardly achieve both good base-class
performance and novel-class generalization simultaneously by applying the
margin during the base-class training, which is still under explored. In this
paper, we study the cause of such dilemma for FSCIL. We first interpret this
dilemma as a class-level overfitting (CO) problem from the aspect of pattern
learning, and then find its cause lies in the easily-satisfied constraint of
learning margin-based patterns. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel
margin-based FSCIL method to mitigate the CO problem by providing the pattern
learning process with extra constraint from the margin-based patterns
themselves. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, Caltech-USCD Birds-200-2011

multiple models, our method utilizes the dropout mechanism on a single model to
reduce the confirmation bias in self-training and introduces a textual-level

setting that has become popular in recent times is of Constrained Reinforcement
Learning, where the agent maximizes its rewards while also aims to satisfy
certain constraint criteria. However, this setting has only been studied in the

work focuses on the effects of liquid miscibility and wettability on the

partial wetting are used. We show that, as long as the jet surface tension is
smaller than the drop surface tension, the drops can be encapsulated by the
jet, providing the so-called drops-in-jet structure. The transitions between
the different regimes remain similar in nature with a capillary fragmentation
responsible for the jet break-up and an inertial fragmentation causing the
drops (and then possibly the jet) to break up. The dimensionless numbers
proposed in the literature to model the inertial fragmentation thresholds do
not bring the results obtained with different liquids at the same critical
value. We explain the reason via a detailed analysis of the collisions,
accounting for the drop and jet extensions and their kinetics. The drop
fragmentation is found to occur during the recoil phase, leading us to propose
a new dimensionless parameter that successfully reproduced all our experimental
data obtained with immiscible liquids. Finally we demonstrate that the most
dramatic change of the collision outcomes is produced by using drops that
totally wet the jet. In this case, the encapsulation of the drops cannot be
achieved, constituting a true limit to some applications based on the
solidification of the drops-in-jet structure.

it increased, in most cases, farmers' protection against worst outcomes. This

bridging a device's physical design and operational parameters to the qubit
energy space is lacking. Furthermore, the spin to charge coupling introduced by
intrinsic or induced Spin-Orbit-Interaction (SOI) exposes the qubits to charge
noise compromising their coherence properties and inducing quantum gate errors.
We present here a co-modelling framework for double quantum dot (DQD) devices
and their charge noise environment. We use a combination of an electrostatic
potential solver, full configuration interaction quantum mechanical methods and
two-level-fluctuator models to study the quantum gate performance in realistic
device designs and operation conditions. We utilize the developed models
together alongside the single electron solutions of the quantum dots to
simulate one- and two- qubit gates in the presence of charge noise. We find an
inverse correlation between quantum gate errors and quantum dot confinement
frequencies. We calculate X-gate fidelities >97% in the simulated Si-MOS
devices at a typical TLF densities. We also find that exchange driven two-qubit
SWAP gates show higher sensitivity to charge noise with fidelities down to 91%
in the presence of the same density of TLFs. We further investigate the one-

the small size of the quantum dots, sensitivity of a quantum gate to the

effects, overcoming fundamental failure modes of previously-existed methods,
such as Partial Dependence Plots. However, ALE's approximation, i.e. the method
for estimating ALE from the limited samples of the training set, faces two
weaknesses. First, it does not scale well in cases where the input has high
dimensionality, and, second, it is vulnerable to out-of-distribution (OOD)
sampling when the training set is relatively small. In this paper, we propose a
novel ALE approximation, called Differential Accumulated Local Effects (DALE),
which can be used in cases where the ML model is differentiable and an
auto-differentiable framework is accessible. Our proposal has significant
computational advantages, making feature effect estimation applicable to
high-dimensional Machine Learning scenarios with near-zero computational
overhead. Furthermore, DALE does not create artificial points for calculating
the feature effect, resolving misleading estimations due to OOD sampling.
Finally, we formally prove that, under some hypotheses, DALE is an unbiased
estimator of ALE and we present a method for quantifying the standard error of
the explanation. Experiments using both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate
the value of the proposed approach.

camera images within the map. While autonomous vehicles drive on the road under
occlusion (e.g., car, bus, truck) and changing environment appearance (e.g.,
illumination changes, seasonal variation), existing approaches rely heavily on
dense point descriptors at the feature level to solve the registration problem,
entangling features with appearance and occlusion. As a result, they often fail
to estimate the correct poses. To address these issues, we propose a sparse
semantic map-based monocular localization method, which solves 2D-3D
registration via a well-designed deep neural network. Given a sparse semantic
map that consists of simplified elements (e.g., pole lines, traffic sign
midpoints) with multiple semantic labels, the camera pose is then estimated by
learning the corresponding features between the 2D semantic elements from the
image and the 3D elements from the sparse semantic map. The proposed sparse
semantic map-based localization approach is robust against occlusion and
long-term appearance changes in the environments. Extensive experimental
results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art

considered to determine the collisional moments of second, third and fourth
degree in a granular binary mixture. These collisional moments are exactly
evaluated in terms of the velocity moments of the distribution function of each
species when diffusion is absent (mass flux of each species vanishes). The
corresponding associated eigenvalues as well as cross coefficients are obtained
as functions of the coefficients of normal restitution and the parameters of
the mixture (masses, diameters and composition). The results are applied to the
analysis of the time evolution of the moments (scaled with a thermal speed) in
two different nonequilibrium situations: the homogeneous cooling state (HCS)
and the uniform (or simple) shear flow (USF) state. In the case of the HCS, in
contrast to what happens for simple granular gases, it is shown that the third
and fourth degree moments could diverge in time for given values of the
parameters of the system. An exhaustive study on the influence of the parameter
space of the mixture on the time behavior of these moments is carried out.
Then, the time evolution of the second- and third-degree velocity moments in
the USF is studied in the tracer limit (namely, when the concentration of one
of the species is negligible). As expected, while the second-degree moments are
always convergent, the third-degree moments of the tracer species can be also
divergent in the long time limit.

account IV has been deemed critical for proper analysis of medical data, this
source of uncertainty and its impact on robustness have so far been neglected
in Machine Learning (ML). To fill this gap, we look at how IV affects ML
performance and generalization and how its impact can be mitigated.
Specifically, we provide a methodological contribution to formalize the problem
of IV in the statistical learning framework and, through an experiment based on
one of the largest real-world laboratory medicine datasets for the problem of

severely impacted by the presence of IV in data; and 2) advanced learning
strategies, based on data augmentation and data imprecisiation, and proper
study designs can be effective at improving robustness to IV. Our findings
demonstrate the critical relevance of correctly accounting for IV to enable
safe deployment of ML in clinical settings.

folding dynamics occur on such short time scales, empirical techniques
developed for more ""static"" protein events, such as X-ray crystallography,
nuclear magnetic resonance, and green fluorescent protein (GFP) labelling,
aren't as applicable. Instead, computational methods must often be used to
simulate these short lived yet highly dynamic events. One such computational
method that is proven to provide much valuable insight into protein folding
dynamics is Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MD Simulation). This simulation
method is both highly computationally demanding, yet highly accurate in its
modelling of a proteins physical behaviour. Besides MD Simulation, simulations
in general are quite applicable in the context of these protein events. For
example, the simple Gillespie algorithm, a computational technique which can be
executed on almost any personal computer, provides quite the robust view into
protein dynamics given its computational simplicity. This paper will compare
the results of two simulations, an MD simulation of a disordered, six-residue,
carcinogenic protein fragment, and a Gillespie algorithm based simulation of an
ordered folding protein: the mathematically identical nature of the Gillespie
algorithm time series of the asymptotically stochastic hyperbolic tangent
dynamics for the wild type predicting the exact behaviour of the carcinogenic
protein system time series will show the computational power simulations
provide for analyzing both disordered and ordered protein systems.

test data. Recent methods have achieved promising progress in overcoming this
problem by reducing the impact of biased samples on model training. However,
these models reveal a trade-off that the improvements on OOD data severely
sacrifice the performance on the in-distribution (ID) data (which is dominated
by the biased samples). Therefore, we propose a novel contrastive learning
approach, MMBS, for building robust VQA models by Making the Most of Biased

by eliminating the information related to spurious correlation from the
original training samples and explore several strategies to use the constructed
positive samples for training. Instead of undermining the importance of biased
samples in model training, our approach precisely exploits the biased samples
for unbiased information that contributes to reasoning. The proposed method is
compatible with various VQA backbones. We validate our contributions by
achieving competitive performance on the OOD dataset VQA-CP v2 while preserving
robust performance on the ID dataset VQA v2.

resolving them. All existing (both theoretical and practical) synchronizers are
operation-based: they define, using some rationale or heuristics, how conflicts
are to be resolved without considering the effect of the resolution on
subsequent conflicts. Instead, our approach is declaration-based: we define
what constitutes the resolution of all conflicts, and for each possible
scenario we prove the existence of sequences of operations / commands which
convert the replicas into a common synchronized state. These sequences consist
of operations rolling back some local changes, followed by operations performed
on the other replica. The set of rolled-back operations provides the user with
clear and intuitive information on the proposed changes, so she can easily
decide whether to accept them or ask for other alternatives. All possible
synchronized states are described by specifying a set of conflicts, a partial
order on the conflicts describing the order in which they need to be resolved,
as well as the effect of each decision on subsequent conflicts. Using this

such active systems must be causal, stable, and carefully tuned to be practical

phase-insensitive amplification in laser interferometers can be implemented in

field. Our design relies on existing membrane and cryogenic technology and can
demonstrate three distinct features: (i) the self-stabilized dynamics of the

  parameters as well",,,,"hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In previous articles, we showed that, based on large-order asymptotic
behavior, one can approximate a divergent series via the parametrization of a
specific hypergeometric approximant. The analytical continuation is then
carried out through a Mellin-Barnes integral representation of the
hypergeometric approximant or equivalently using an equivalent form of the
Meijer G-Function. The parametrization process involves the solution of a
non-linear set of coupled equations which is hard to achieve (might be
impossible) for high orders using normal PCs. In this work, we extend the
approximation algorithm to accommodate any order (high or low) of the given
series in a short time. The extension also allows us to employ non-perturbative
information like strong-coupling and large-order asymptotic data which are
always used to accelerate the convergence. We applied the algorithm for
different orders (up to O($29$)) of the ground state energy of the $x^4$
anharmonic oscillator with and without the non-perturbative information. We
also considered the available $20$ orders for the ground sate energy of the
$\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric $ix^{3}$ anharmonic oscillator as well as the given
$20$ orders of its strong-coupling expansion or equivalently the Yang-Lee
model. For high order weak-coupling parametrization, accurate results have been
obtained for the ground state energy and the non-perturbative parameters
describing strong-coupling and large-order asymptotic behaviors. The employment
of the non-perturbative data accelerated the convergence very clearly. The High
temperature expansion for the susceptibility within the $SQ$ lattice has been
also considered and led to accurate prediction for the critical exponent and
critical temperature.

uncurated datasets from the web has been the subject of much research as it
reduces the need for time consuming human labor. The focus of many previous
research contributions has been on the detection of different types of label
noise; however, this paper proposes to improve the correction accuracy of noisy
samples once they have been detected. In many state-of-the-art contributions, a
two phase approach is adopted where the noisy samples are detected before
guessing a corrected pseudo-label in a semi-supervised fashion. The guessed
pseudo-labels are then used in the supervised objective without ensuring that
the label guess is likely to be correct. This can lead to confirmation bias,
which reduces the noise robustness. Here we propose the pseudo-loss, a simple
metric that we find to be strongly correlated with pseudo-label correctness on
noisy samples. Using the pseudo-loss, we dynamically down weight
under-confident pseudo-labels throughout training to avoid confirmation bias
and improve the network accuracy. We additionally propose to use a confidence
guided contrastive objective that learns robust representation on an
interpolated objective between class bound (supervised) for confidently
corrected samples and unsupervised representation for under-confident label
corrections. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
Pseudo-Loss Selection (PLS) algorithm on a variety of benchmark datasets

out-of-distribution noise, and two real world web noise datasets. Our

(constrained to the closed ball) results in a simple descent method, for which
we prove convergence to minimal points in case the objective is convex. To
obtain an implementable method, we construct an approximation scheme for the
second-order information based on sampling objective values, gradients and
Hessian matrices at finitely many points. Using a set of test problems, we
compare the resulting method to five other available solvers. Considering the

purpose of this work is to test and compare different analysis methods in the
context of inter-fractional PET image comparison for proton treatment
verification.
  Methods: For our study we used the FLUKA Monte Carlo code and artificially
generated CT scans to simulate in-beam PET distributions at different stages
during proton therapy treatment. We compared the Beam-Eye-View method, the
Most-Likely-Shift method, the Voxel-Based-Morphology method and the gamma
evaluation method to compare PET images at the start of treatment, and after a
few weeks of treatment. The results were compared to the CT scan.
  Results and conclusions: Three-dimensional methods like VBM and gamma are
preferred above two-dimensional methods like MLS and BEV if much statistics is
available, since the these methods allow to identify the regions with anomalous
activity. The VBM approach has as disadvantage that a larger number of MC
simulations is needed. The gamma analysis has the disadvantage that no clinical
indication exist on tolerance criteria. In terms of calculation time, the BEV
and MLS method are preferred. We recommend to use the four methods together, in
order to best identify the location and cause of the activity changes.

adaptive optics systems. The optical calibration of an adaptive mirror is a
fundamental step during its life-cycle: the process is in facts required to
compute a set of known commands to operate the adaptive optics system, to
compensate alignment and non common-path aberrations, to run chopped or
field-stabilized acquisitions. In this work we present the sequence of
operations for the optical calibration of adaptive mirrors, with a specific
focus on large aperture systems such as the adaptive secondaries. Such systems
will be one of the core components of the extremely large telescopes.
  Beyond presenting the optical procedures, we discuss in detail the actors,
their functional requirements and the mutual interactions. A specific emphasys
is put on automation, through a clear identification of inputs, outputs and
quality indicators for each step: due to a high degrees-of-freedom count
(thousands of actuators), an automated approach is preferable to constraint the
cost and schedule. In the end we present some algorithms for the evaluation of
the measurement noise; this point is particularly important since the
calibration setup is typically a large facility in an industrial environment,
where the noise level may be a major show-stopper.

high-order connectivity in graphs, have been widely applied in recommender
systems. Stacking multiple neighbor aggregation is the major operation in GCNs.
It implicitly captures popularity features because the number of neighbor nodes
reflects the popularity of a node. However, existing GCN-based methods ignore a
universal problem: users' sensitivity to item popularity is differentiated, but
the neighbor aggregations in GCNs actually fix this sensitivity through Graph
Laplacian Normalization, leading to suboptimal personalization.
  In this work, we propose to model multi-grained popularity features and
jointly learn them together with high-order connectivity, to match the
differentiation of user preferences exhibited in popularity features.
Specifically, we develop a Joint Multi-grained Popularity-aware Graph
Convolution Collaborative Filtering model, short for JMP-GCF, which uses a
popularity-aware embedding generation to construct multi-grained popularity
features, and uses the idea of joint learning to capture the signals within and
between different granularities of popularity features that are relevant for
modeling user preferences. Additionally, we propose a multistage stacked
training strategy to speed up model convergence. We conduct extensive
experiments on three public datasets to show the state-of-the-art performance

is currently solved using gradient-based optimization in conjunction with
methods that can introduce additional thin-film layers. Recently, Deep Learning
and Reinforcement Learning have been been introduced to the task of designing
thin-films with great success, however a trained network is usually only able
to become proficient for a single target and must be retrained if the optical
targets are varied. In this work, we apply conditional Invertible Neural
Networks (cINN) to inversely designing multilayer thin-films given an optical
target. Since the cINN learns the energy landscape of all thin-film
configurations within the training dataset, we show that cINNs can generate a
stochastic ensemble of proposals for thin-film configurations that that are
reasonably close to the desired target depending only on random variables. By
refining the proposed configurations further by a local optimization, we show
that the generated thin-films reach the target with significantly greater
precision than comparable state-of-the art approaches. Furthermore, we tested
the generative capabilities on samples which are outside the training data
distribution and found that the cINN was able to predict thin-films for
out-of-distribution targets, too. The results suggest that in order to improve
the generative design of thin-films, it is instructive to use established and

querying over decentralized data networks, in which a client-side query engine
discovers data by traversing links between documents. Since decentralized
environments are potentially unsafe due to their non-centrally controlled
nature, there is a need for client-side LTQP query engines to be resistant
against security threats aimed at the query engine's host machine or the query
initiator's personal data. As such, we have performed an analysis of potential
security vulnerabilities of LTQP. This article provides an overview of security
threats in related domains, which are used as inspiration for the
identification of 10 LTQP security threats. Each threat is explained, together
with an example, and one or more avenues for mitigations are proposed. We
conclude with several concrete recommendations for LTQP query engine developers

classification tasks share the same label space and are learned simultaneously.
In particular, we tackle a new setting, which is more realistic than currently
addressed in the literature, where categories shift from training to test data.
Hence, individual tasks do not contain complete training data for the
categories in the test set. To generalize to such test data, it is crucial for
individual tasks to leverage knowledge from related tasks. To this end, we
propose learning an association graph to transfer knowledge among tasks for
missing classes. We construct the association graph with nodes representing
tasks, classes and instances, and encode the relationships among the nodes in
the edges to guide their mutual knowledge transfer. By message passing on the
association graph, our model enhances the categorical information of each
instance, making it more discriminative. To avoid spurious correlations between
task and class nodes in the graph, we introduce an assignment entropy
maximization that encourages each class node to balance its edge weights. This
enables all tasks to fully utilize the categorical information from related
tasks. An extensive evaluation on three general benchmarks and a medical
dataset for skin lesion classification reveals that our method consistently
performs better than representative baselines.

emission and the underlying obscured continuum. We find that the NE nucleus (A)
is highly obscured where the low PAH equivalent width (EW) ratio,
EW(12.7)/EW(11.3), reveals a dust enshrouded continuum source. This is
confirmed by decomposing the continuum into nuclear and star-forming where the
nuclear component is found to be typical of CONs. The 11.3/6.2 PAH flux ratio
is consistent with originating in star-forming regions rather than typical AGN.
The second nucleus (B) is much less obscured, with PAH flux ratios also typical
of star-forming regions. We do not detect any high ionisation lines such as [Ne
V] or [Ne VI] which suggests that if an AGN is present it must be highly
obscured. Additionally, we detect a shock front south of the secondary nucleus
(B) in the [Fe II] (5.34 $\mu$m) line and in warm molecular hydrogen. The 6.2
PAH emission does not spatially coincide with the low-J transitions of H$_2$
but rather appears strong at the shock front which may suggest destruction of
the ionised PAHs in the post-shock gas behind the shock front.

its inverse, the limits can either satisfy the usual homogenisation formula for

introduce the `inner spectrum' for conductivities. We show that even though $0$

down to $M_{\rm HI}\sim 10^7 M_{\odot}$ using the MIGHTEE Early Science data
with a Bayesian technique. This technique is applied to the HI detections,
without binning the datasets, while taking account of the intrinsic scatter in
the $M_{\rm HI}-M_{\star}$ relation. We divide the full sample of 249 galaxies
into 161 spirals, 64 irregulars, 15 mergers, and 9 elliptical galaxies to
measure their $M_{\rm HI}-M_{\star}$ relations. We fit this relation with both
linear and non-linear models, and find that the non-linear model is preferred
over the linear one for the full HI-selected sample with a measured transition
stellar mass of $\log_{10}(M_\star$/$M_{\odot})$ = $9.15^{+0.8}_{-0.95}$,
beyond which the measured slope flattens. This finding supports the view that
the lack of HI gas is ultimately responsible for the decreasing star formation
rate observed in the massive main sequence galaxies. For the spiral galaxies
alone, which are biased towards those galaxies with the highest stellar masses
in our sample, the slope beyond the transition mass is shallower than for the
full sample, indicative of distinct gas processes ongoing for the
spirals/high-mass galaxies from other types of galaxies with lower stellar
masses. We also observe a moderate evolution of the $M_{\rm HI}-M_{\star}$
relation when splitting our samples into two redshift bins over the last
billion years, which can largely be attributed to the effect of sample
selection and hence highlights the potential of the full MIGHTEE survey.

light sources is a very challenging task, especially when realistic assumptions
such as light propagation and attenuation, perspective viewing geometry and
specular light reflection are considered. Many of works tackling Photometric
Stereo (PS) problems often relax most of the aforementioned assumptions.
Especially they ignore specular reflection and global illumination effects. In
this work, we propose a CNN-based approach capable of handling these realistic
assumptions by leveraging recent improvements of deep neural networks for
far-field Photometric Stereo and adapt them to the point light setup. We
achieve this by employing an iterative procedure of point-light PS for shape
estimation which has two main steps. Firstly we train a per-pixel CNN to
predict surface normals from reflectance samples. Secondly, we compute the
depth by integrating the normal field in order to iteratively estimate light
directions and attenuation which is used to compensate the input images to
compute reflectance samples for the next iteration.
  Our approach sigificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the DiLiGenT
real world dataset. Furthermore, in order to measure the performance of our
approach for near-field point-light source PS data, we introduce LUCES the
first real-world 'dataset for near-fieLd point light soUrCe photomEtric Stereo'

outperforms the competition on this dataset as well. Data and test code are

nonlinear gravitational instability instead of mathematically rigorous

system which exhibits the \textit{nonlinear} gravitational instability of
\textit{matter with inhomogeneous pressure and entropy} (i.e., the cold center

perturbations being homogeneous, the pressure is not, resulting in significant

rate of the density contrast is approximately $\sim \exp(t^{\frac{2}{3}})$,
much faster than the growth rate anticipated by classical linear Jeans
instability ($\sim t^{\frac{2}{3}}$). Our main motivation for constructing this
family of solutions is to provide a family of reference solutions for

UV/optical data observed by {\it Fermi}-LAT, Swift XRT, NuSTAR and Swift-UVOT
over a period of 14 years, between August 2008 and March 2022, was performed.
We found strong variability of source emission in all the considered bands,
especially in the $\gamma$-ray band it exhibited extreme outbursts when the
flux crossed the level of $10^{-5}\:{\rm photon\:cm^{-2}\:s^{-1}}$. Using the
Bayesian Blocks algorithm, we split the adaptively binned $\gamma$-ray light
curve into 347 intervals of quiescent and flaring episodes and for each period
built corresponding multiwavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs), using
the available data. Among the considered SEDs, 117 high-quality (quasi)
contemporaneous SEDs which have sufficient multiwavelength data, were modeled
using JetSeT framework within a one-zone leptonic synchrotron and inverse
Compton emission scenario assuming the emitting region is within the
broad-line-region and considering internal and external seed photons for the
inverse Compton up-scattering. As a result of modeling, the characteristics of
the relativistic electron distribution in the jet as well as jet properties are
retrieved and their variation in time is investigated. The applied model can
adequately explain the assembled SEDs and the modelling shows that the data in
the bright flaring periods can be reproduced for high Doppler boosting and
magnetic field. The obtained results are discussed in the context of particle
cooling in the emitting region.

  Prediction Model",,,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In a critical software system, the testers have to spend an enormous amount
of time and effort to maintain the software due to the continuous occurrence of
defects. Among such defects, some severe defects may adversely affect the
software. To reduce the time and effort of a tester, many machine learning
models have been proposed in the literature, which use the documented defect
reports to automatically predict the severity of the defective software
modules. In contrast to the traditional approaches, in this work we propose a
metric-based software defect severity prediction (SDSP) model that uses a
self-training semi-supervised learning approach to classify the severity of the
defective software modules. The approach is constructed on a mixture of
unlabelled and labelled defect severity data. The self-training works on the
basis of a decision tree classifier to assign the pseudo-class labels to the
unlabelled instances. The predictions are promising since the self-training
successfully assigns the suitable class labels to the unlabelled instances.
  On the other hand, numerous research studies have covered proposing
prediction approaches as well as the methodological aspects of defect severity
prediction models, the gap in estimating project attributes from the prediction
model remains unresolved. To bridge the gap, we propose five project specific
measures such as the Risk-Factor (RF), the Percent of Saved Budget (PSB), the
Loss in the Saved Budget (LSB), the Remaining Service Time (RST) and Gratuitous
Service Time (GST) to capture project outcomes from the predictions. Similar to
the traditional measures, these measures are also calculated from the observed
confusion matrix. These measures are used to analyse the impact that the
prediction model has on the software project.

individuals become susceptible again following each infection. In contrast to
classical compartment models, after each infection, the infectivity is a random
function of the time elapsed since one's infection. Similarly, recovered
individuals become gradually susceptible after some time according to a random
susceptibility function. We study the large population asymptotic behaviour of
the model, by proving a functional law of large numbers (FLLN) and
investigating the endemic equilibria properties of the limit. The limit depends
on the law of the susceptibility random functions but only on the mean
infectivity functions. The FLLN is proved by constructing a sequence of i.i.d.
auxiliary processes and adapting the approach from the theory of propagation of
chaos. The limit is a generalisation of a PDE model introduced by Kermack and
McKendrick, and we show how this PDE model can be obtained as a special case of
our FLLN limit.% for a particular set of infectivity and susceptibility random
functions and initial conditions. For the endemic equilibria, if $ R_0 $ is
lower than (or equal to) some threshold, the epidemic does not last forever and
eventually disappears from the population, while if $ R_0 $ is larger than this
threshold, the epidemic will not disappear and there exists an endemic
equilibrium. The value of this threshold turns out to depend on the harmonic
mean of the susceptibility a long time after an infection, a fact which was not
previously known.

Post-Newtonian limits, of the energy-momentum powered gravity (EMPG), viz., the
energy-momentum squared gravity (EMSG) of the form
$f(T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})=\alpha (T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})^{\eta}$ with $\alpha$
and $\eta$ being constants. We have shown that EMPG with $\eta\geq0$ and
general relativity (GR) are not distinguishable by local tests, say, the Solar
System tests; as they lead to the same gravitational potential form, PPN
parameters, and geodesics for the test particles. However, within the EMPG
framework, $M_{\rm ast}$, the mass of an astrophysical object inferred from
astronomical observations such as planetary orbits and deflection of light,
corresponds to the effective mass $M_{\rm eff}(\alpha,\eta,M)=M+M_{\rm
empg}(\alpha,\eta,M)$, $M$ being the actual physical mass and $M_{\rm empg}$
being the modification due to EMPG. Accordingly, while in GR we simply have the
relation $M_{\rm ast}=M$, in EMPG we have $M_{\rm ast}=M+M_{\rm empg}$. Within
the framework of EMPG, if there is information about the values of
$\{\alpha,\eta\}$ pair or $M$ from other independent phenomena (from
cosmological observations, structure of the astrophysical object, etc.), then
in principle it is possible to infer not only $M_{\rm ast}$ alone from
astronomical observations, but $M$ and $M_{\rm empg}$ separately. For a proper
analysis within EMPG framework, it is necessary to describe the slow motion
condition (also related to the Newtonian limit approximation) by $|p_{\rm
eff}/\rho_{\rm eff}|\ll1$ (where $p_{\rm eff}=p+p_{\rm empg}$ and $\rho_{\rm
eff}=\rho+\rho_{\rm empg}$), whereas this condition leads to $|p/\rho|\ll1$ in

forming an order parameter which is usually assumed to be a spin density wave

density wave contribution to the order parameter, that is, inhomogeneous

calculate self-consistently the spin structure of the order parameter. We find
that the density wave order is stable in the whole doping range from $-4$ to
$+4$ extra electrons per supercell. The spin texture changes from collinear at
zero doping to almost coplanar at finite doping. The density wave order shows
nematic distortion when we dope the system. We demonstrate that the local spin

quality of distorted point clouds with available references. Merging the
research of cognitive science and intuition of the human visual system (HVS),
the difference between the expected perceptual result and the practical
perception reproduction in the visual center of the cerebral cortex indicates
the subjective quality degradation. Therefore in this paper, we try to derive
the point cloud quality by measuring the complexity of transforming the
distorted point cloud back to its reference, which in practice can be
approximated by the code length of one point cloud when the other is given. For
this purpose, we first segment the reference and the distorted point cloud into
a series of local patch pairs based on one 3D Voronoi diagram. Next, motivated
by the predictive coding theory, we utilize one space-aware vector
autoregressive (SA-VAR) model to encode the geometry and color channels of each
reference patch in cases with and without the distorted patch, respectively.
Specifically, supposing that the residual errors follow the multi-variate
Gaussian distributions, we calculate the self-complexity of the reference and
the transformational complexity between the reference and the distorted sample
via covariance matrices. Besides the complexity terms, the prediction terms
generated by SA-VAR are introduced as one auxiliary feature to promote the
final quality prediction. Extensive experiments on five public point cloud
quality databases demonstrate that the transformational complexity based
distortion metric (TCDM) produces state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, and ablation
studies have further shown that our metric can be generalized to various
scenarios with consistent performance by examining its key modules and
parameters.

into account the fatigue due to spike emissions and the consequent reduction of
the firing activity. We have studied the effect of this adaptation mechanism on
the macroscopic dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory networks of quadratic
integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons coupled via exponentially decaying
post-synaptic potentials. In particular, we have studied the population
activities by employing an exact mean field reduction, which gives rise to next
generation neural mass models. This low-dimensional reduction allows for the
derivation of bifurcation diagrams and the identification of the possible
macroscopic regimes emerging both in a single and in two identically coupled
neural masses. In single populations SFA favours the emergence of population
bursts in excitatory networks, while it hinders tonic population spiking for
inhibitory ones. The symmetric coupling of two neural masses, in absence of
adaptation, leads to the emergence of macroscopic solutions with broken
symmetry: namely, chimera-like solutions in the inhibitory case and anti-phase
population spikes in the excitatory one. The addition of SFA leads to new
collective dynamical regimes exhibiting cross-frequency coupling (CFC) among
the fast synaptic time scale and the slow adaptation one, ranging from
anti-phase slow-fast nested oscillations to symmetric and asymmetric bursting
phenomena. The analysis of these CFC rhythms in the $\theta$-$\gamma$ range has
revealed that a reduction of SFA leads to an increase of the $\theta$ frequency
joined to a decrease of the $\gamma$ one. This is analogous to what reported
experimentally for the hippocampus and the olfactory cortex of rodents under

resolution. However, in conventional vertical photography model, the UAV should
fly to the top of ground targets (GTs) to capture images, thus enlarge the
transmission delay. In this paper, we propose an oblique photography model,
which allows the UAV to capture images of GTs from a far distance while still
satisfying the predetermined resolution requirement. Based on the proposed
oblique photography model, we further study the UAV placement problem in the
cellular-connected UAV-assisted image acquisition system, which aims at
minimizing the data transmission delay under the condition of satisfying the
predetermined image resolution requirement. Firstly, the proposed scheme is
first formulated as an intractable non-convex optimization problem. Then, the
original problem is simplified to obtain a tractable suboptimal solution with
the help of the block coordinate descent and the successive convex

the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The numerical results have shown that
the proposed scheme can largely save the transmission time as compared to the

  using radioactive ion beams",,,,,"physics.med-ph nucl-ex","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Radiotherapy with heavy ions, in particular, 12C beams, is one of the most
advanced forms of cancer treatment. Sharp dose gradients and high biological
effectiveness in the target region make them an ideal tool to treat deep-seated
and radioresistant tumors, however, at the same time, sensitive to small errors
in the range prediction. Safety margins are added to the tumor volume to
mitigate these uncertainties and ensure its uniform coverage, but during the
irradiation they lead to unavoidable damage to the surrounding healthy tissue.
To fully exploit the benefits of a sharp Bragg peak, a large effort is put into
establishing precise range verification methods for the so-called image-guided
radiotherapy. Despite positron emission tomography being widely in use for this
purpose in 12C ion therapy, the low count rates, biological washout, and broad
shape of the activity distribution still limit its precision to a few
millimeters. Instead, radioactive beams used directly for treatment would yield
an improved signal and a closer match with the dose fall-off, potentially
enabling precise in vivo beam range monitoring. We have performed a treatment
planning study to estimate the possible impact of the reduced range
uncertainties, enabled by radioactive 11C beams treatments, on sparing critical
organs in the tumor proximity. We demonstrate that (i) annihilation maps for
11C ions can in principle reflect even millimeter shifts in dose distributions
in the patient, (ii) outcomes of treatment planning with 11C beams are
significantly improved in terms of meeting the constraints for the organs at
risk compared to 12C plans, and (iii) less severe toxicities for serial and
parallel critical organs can be expected following 11C treatment with reduced
range uncertainties, compared to 12C treatments.

evaluate the VQA models' reasoning ability beyond shortcut learning, the VQA-CP
v2 dataset introduces a distribution shift between the training and test set
given a question type. In this way, the model cannot use the training set
shortcut (from question type to answer) to perform well on the test set.
However, VQA-CP v2 only considers one type of shortcut and thus still cannot
guarantee that the model relies on the intended solution rather than a solution
specific to this shortcut. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new
dataset that considers varying types of shortcuts by constructing different
distribution shifts in multiple OOD test sets. In addition, we overcome the
three troubling practices in the use of VQA-CP v2, e.g., selecting models using
OOD test sets, and further standardize OOD evaluation procedure. Our benchmark
provides a more rigorous and comprehensive testbed for shortcut learning in
VQA. We benchmark recent methods and find that methods specifically designed
for particular shortcuts fail to simultaneously generalize to our varying OOD
test sets. We also systematically study the varying shortcuts and provide
several valuable findings, which may promote the exploration of shortcut

to have imparted a faint signal onto the 21-cm spin temperature from atomic
Hydrogen gas in the early Universe. Observationally, an absorption feature
should be measurable as a frequency-dependence in the sky-averaged (i.e.
global) temperature at meter wavelengths. This signal should be separable from
the smooth -- but orders of magnitude brighter -- foregrounds by jointly
fitting a log-polynomial and absorption trough to radiometer spectra. A
majority of approaches to measure the global 21-cm signal use radiometer
systems on dipole-like antennas. Here, we argue that beamforming-based methods
may allow radio arrays to measure the global 21-cm signal. We simulate an
end-to-end drift-scan observation of the radio sky at 50--100 MHz using a
zenith-phased array, and find that the complex sidelobe structure introduces a
significant frequency-dependent systematic. However, the {\lambda}/D evolution
of the beam width with frequency does not confound detection. We conclude that
a beamformed array with a median sidelobe level around 50 dB below the main
beam may offer an alternative method to measure the global 21-cm signal. This
level is achievable by arrays with O(10^5) antennas.

between two gold or ITO electrodes, serving as a cell surfaces. In bulk, NF is
expected to exhibit a Goldstone mode (phason), because polarization can
uniformly rotate with no energy cost. However, because the coupling between the
direction of nematic director and polarization is finite, and the confinement,
even in the absence of the aligning surface layer, induces some energy cost for
a reorientation of polarization, the phason dielectric relaxation frequency is
measured in a kHz regime. The phason mode is easily quenched by a bias electric
field, which enables fluctuations in the magnitude of polarization to be
followed in both, the ferronematic and nematic phases. This amplitude (soft)
mode is also influenced by boundary conditions. A theory describing the phase
and amplitude fluctuations in the NF phase shows that the free energy of the
system and, consequently, the dielectric response are dominated by
polarization-related terms with the flexoelectricity being relevant only at a
very weak surface anchoring. Contributions due to the nematic elastic terms are
always negligible. The model relates the observed low frequency mode to the

domain knowledge. However, existing biomedical document summarization systems
have paid little attention to readability control, leaving users with summaries
that are incompatible with their levels of expertise. In recognition of this
urgent demand, we introduce a new task of readability controllable
summarization for biomedical documents, which aims to recognise users'
readability demands and generate summaries that better suit their needs:
technical summaries for experts and plain language summaries (PLS) for laymen.
To establish this task, we construct a corpus consisting of biomedical papers
with technical summaries and PLSs written by the authors, and benchmark
multiple advanced controllable abstractive and extractive summarization models
based on pre-trained language models (PLMs) with prevalent controlling and
generation techniques. Moreover, we propose a novel masked language model (MLM)
based metric and its variant to effectively evaluate the readability
discrepancy between lay and technical summaries. Experimental results from
automated and human evaluations show that though current control techniques
allow for a certain degree of readability adjustment during generation, the
performance of existing controllable summarization methods is far from
desirable in this task.

dynamical systems with periodic time-varying delay [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120,
084102 (2018)]. It is characterized by nearly constant laminar phases, which
are periodically interrupted by irregular bursts, where the intensity levels of
the laminar phases vary chaotically from phase to phase. In this paper, we
demonstrate that laminar chaos can also be observed in systems with
quasiperiodic delay, where we generalize the concept of conservative and
dissipative delays to such systems. It turns out that the durations of the
laminar phases vary quasiperiodically and follow the dynamics of a torus map in
contrast to the periodic variation observed for periodic delay. Theoretical and
numerical results indicate that introducing a quasiperiodic delay modulation
into a time-delay system can lead to a giant reduction of the dimension of the
chaotic attractors. By varying the mean delay and keeping other parameters
fixed, we found that the Kaplan-Yorke dimension is modulated quasiperiodically
over several orders of magnitudes, where the dynamics switches
quasiperiodically between different types of high- and low-dimensional types of
chaos.

We find that for a hexagonal dipole antenna, this simultaneous fitting produces
a significant improvement in the accuracy of the recovered 21cm signal,
relative to fitting a time average of the data. Furthermore, the recovered
models of the foreground are also seen to become more accurate by up to a
factor of $\sim$2-3 relative to time averaged fitting. For a less chromatic log
spiral antenna, no significant improvement in signal recovery was found by this
process. However, the modelling of the foregrounds was still significantly
improved. We also investigate extending this technique to fit multiple data
sets from different antennae simultaneously for the same parameters. This is
also found to improve both 21cm signal and foreground modelling, to a higher

asymmetric cap-shock non-uniform Mach Reflection (csMR) phenomenon outside of

the wedge-induced steady symmetric and asymmetric Mach reflection (MR)
configurations, as well as symmetric MR in an open jet. However, there is
another structure occurring in nozzle flow fields known as a non-uniformity
induced cap-shock pattern. We derive a new analytical model to predict the wave
structure of the asymmetric csMR in the absence of internal shocks by extending
on a prior symmetric Mach reflection model. Different from the wedge flow case,
flow non-uniformity is incorporated by assuming different upstream Mach numbers
in both upper and lower domains, where the asymmetry is predicted through
averaged flowfields and slipstream inclination angles. The numerical approach
utilises an Euler solver for comparisons to the developed theory. It is found
that the model adequately predicts the shock structure obtained from numerical
simulations, and can be utilised for various sets of parameters to capture the
overall direct Mach reflection o[DiMR+DiMR] configuration. The von Neumann
criterion is also well captured by the new analytic model, along with the Mach
stem profile and shock curvatures. Based on the analytical and numerical
observations, a hypothesis is also made regarding the stability of MR
structures within an over-expanded jet.

is also crucial for the pipeline to minimize the calibration error, especially
in safety-critical applications. That is, the pipeline should reliably indicate

systems is a significant task to be solved in many science and engineering
fields, but remains still an open challenge. The present paper develops a novel
approach, termed 'fractional moments-based mixture distribution', to address
such challenge. This approach is implemented by capturing the extreme value
distribution (EVD) of the system response with the concepts of fractional
moments and mixture distribution. In our context, the fractional moment itself
is by definition a high-dimensional integral with a complicated integrand. To
efficiently compute the fractional moments, a parallel adaptive sampling scheme
that allows for sample size extension is developed using the refined Latinized
stratified sampling (RLSS). In this manner, both variance reduction and
parallel computing are possible for evaluating the fractional moments. From the
knowledge of low-order fractional moments, the EVD of interest is then expected
to be reconstructed. Based on introducing an extended inverse Gaussian
distribution and a log extended skew-normal distribution, one flexible mixture
distribution model is proposed, where its fractional moments are derived in
analytic form. By fitting a set of fractional moments, the EVD can be recovered
via the proposed mixture model. Accordingly, the first-passage probabilities
under different thresholds can be obtained from the recovered EVD
straightforwardly. The performance of the proposed method is verified by three
examples consisting of two test examples and one engineering problem.

computational resources. The recent Factored Gradient Descent (FGD) algorithm
and its variants achieved state-of-the-art performance since they could
mitigate the dimensionality barrier by utilizing some of the underlying
structures of the density matrix. Despite their theoretical guarantee of a
linear convergence rate, the convergence in practical scenarios is still slow
because the contracting factor of the FGD algorithms depends on the condition
number $\kappa$ of the ground truth state. Consequently, the total number of
iterations can be as large as $O(\sqrt{\kappa}\ln(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}))$ to
achieve the estimation error $\varepsilon$. In this work, we derive a quantum
state tomography scheme that improves the dependence on $\kappa$ to the
logarithmic scale; namely, our algorithm could achieve the approximation error
$\varepsilon$ in $O(\ln(\frac{1}{\kappa\varepsilon}))$ steps. The improvement
comes from the application of the non-convex Riemannian gradient descent (RGD).
The contracting factor in our approach is thus a universal constant that is
independent of the given state. Our theoretical results of extremely fast
convergence and nearly optimal error bounds are corroborated by numerical
results.

Telescope. The survey provides accurate radial velocities, stellar parameters,
and elemental abundances for ~115,000 stars in all Milky Way components. In
this paper we describe the method adopted in the final data release to derive
lithium equivalent widths (EWs) and abundances. Lithium EWs were measured using
two different approaches for FGK and M-type stars, to account for the intrinsic
differences in the spectra. For FGK stars, we fitted the lithium line using
Gaussian components, while direct integration over a predefined interval was
adopted for M-type stars. Care was taken to ensure continuity between the two
regimes. Abundances were derived using a new set of homogeneous curves of
growth that were derived specifically for GES, and which were measured on a
synthetic spectral grid consistently with the way the EWs were measured. The
derived abundances were validated by comparison with those measured by other
analysis groups using different methods. Lithium EWs were measured for ~40,000
stars, and abundances could be derived for ~38,000 of them. The vast majority
of the measures (80%) have been obtained for stars in open cluster fields. The
remaining objects are stars in globular clusters, or field stars in the Milky
Way disc, bulge, and halo. The GES dataset of homogeneous lithium abundances
described here will be valuable for our understanding of several processes,
from stellar evolution and internal mixing in stars at different evolutionary
stages to Galactic evolution.

user-understandable information for ""why"" an action is chosen. Proposed
sentence chunking: We propose a technique Experiential Explanations to generate
counterfactual explanations by training influence predictors alongside the RL
policy. Influence predictors are models that learn how sources of reward affect
the agent in different states, thus restoring information about how the policy
reflects the environment. A human evaluation study revealed that participants
presented with experiential explanations were better able to correctly guess
what an agent would do than those presented with other standard types of
explanations. Participants also found experiential explanations to be more
understandable, satisfying, complete, useful, and accurate. The qualitative
analysis provides insights into the factors of experiential explanations that
find most useful.

  gravity-dominated variably-saturated groundwater flow","21 pages, 9 figures",,,,"physics.comp-ph physics.flu-dyn physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Richards equation is often used to represent two-phase fluid flow in an
unsaturated porous medium when one phase is much heavier and more viscous than
the other. However, it cannot describe the fully saturated flow due to
degeneracy in the capillary pressure term. Mathematically, gravity-driven
variably saturated flows are interesting because their governing partial
differential equation switches from hyperbolic in the unsaturated region to
elliptic in the saturated region. Moreover, the presence of wetting fronts
introduces strong spatial gradients often leading to numerical instability. In
this work, we develop a robust, multidimensional mathematical and computational
model for such variably saturated flow in the limit of negligible capillary
forces. The elliptic problem for saturated regions is built-in efficiently into
our framework for a reduced system corresponding to the saturated cells, with
the boundary condition of the fixed head at the unsaturated cells. In summary,
this coupled hyperbolic-elliptic PDE framework provides an efficient,
physics-based extension of the hyperbolic Richards equation to simulate fully
saturated regions. Finally, we provide a suite of easy-to-implement yet
challenging benchmark test problems involving saturated flows in one and two
dimensions. These simple problems, accompanied by their corresponding
analytical solutions, can prove to be pivotal for the code verification, model
validation (V&V) and performance comparison of such simulators. Our numerical
solutions show an excellent comparison with the analytical results for the
proposed problems. The last test problem on two-dimensional infiltration in a
stratified, heterogeneous soil shows the formation and evolution of multiple
disconnected saturated regions.

anisotropy. Together with other instabilities, they play a fundamental role in
constraining the free energy contained in the plasma. This study focuses on
mirror modes observed in the solar wind by Solar Orbiter for heliocentric
distances between 0.5 and 1 AU. Typically, mirror modes have timescales from
several to tens of seconds and are considered quasi-MHD structures. In the
solar wind, they also generally appear as isolated structures. However, in
certain conditions, prolonged and bursty trains of higher frequency mirror
modes are measured, which have been labeled previously as mirror mode storms.
At present, only a handful of existing studies have focused on mirror mode
storms, meaning that many open questions remain. In this study, Solar Orbiter
has been used to investigate several key aspects of mirror mode storms: their
dependence on heliocentric distance, association with local plasma properties,
temporal/spatial scale, amplitude, and connections with larger-scale solar wind
transients. The main results are that mirror mode storms often approach local
ion scales and can no longer be treated as quasi-MHD, thus breaking the
commonly used long-wavelength assumption. They are typically observed close to
current sheets and downstream of interplanetary shocks. The events were
observed during slow solar wind speeds and there was a tendency for higher
occurrence closer to the Sun. The occurrence is low, so they do not play a
fundamental role in regulating ambient solar wind but may play a larger role
inside transients.

typical half-power width ~0.1pc, but this finding has been questioned on the
ground that the measured widths tend to increase with distance. Here we revisit
the dependence of measured filament widths on distance or equivalently spatial
resolution, in an effort to determine whether nearby molecular filaments have a
characteristic half-power width or whether this is an artifact of the finite
resolution of the Herschel data. We perform a convergence test on the B211/213
filament in Taurus, by degrading the resolution of the Herschel data several
times and re-estimating the filament width from the resulting column density
profiles. We also compare the widths measured for the Taurus filament and other
filaments from the Herschel Gould Belt survey to those found for synthetic
filaments with various types of simple, idealized column density profiles. We
find that the measured filament widths do increase slightly as the spatial
resolution worsens and/or the distance to the filaments increases. However,
this trend is entirely consistent with what is expected from simple beam
convolution for filaments with density profiles that are Plummer-like and have
intrinsic half-power diameters ~0.08-0.1 pc and logarithmic slopes 1.5 < p <
2.5 at large radii, as observed in many cases including the Taurus filament.
Due to the presence of background noise fluctuations, deconvolution of the
measured widths from the telescope beam quickly becomes inaccurate. We conclude
that the typical half-power filament width ~0.1 pc measured with Herschel in
nearby clouds most likely reflects the presence of a true common scale in the
filamentary structure of the cold interstellar medium, at least in the solar
neighborhood. We suggest that this common scale may correspond to the
magnetized turbulent correlation length in molecular clouds.

excitation energy of the compound fissioning system by using the four-momenta
of the two outgoing protons. Therefore, this new approach might permit to
correlate the excitation energy with the charge and mass distributions of the

optically opaque materials for controlling light delivery or performing
imaging. Among various complex devices, multi-mode optical fibers stand out as
cost-effective and easy-to-handle tools, making them attractive for several
tasks. In this context, we leverage the reservoir computing paradigm to recast
these fibers into random hardware projectors, transforming an input dataset
into a higher dimensional speckled image set. The goal of our study is to
demonstrate that using such randomized data for classification by training a
single logistic regression layer improves accuracy compared to training on
direct raw images. Interestingly, we found that the classification accuracy
achieved using the reservoir is also higher than that obtained with the
standard transmission matrix model, a widely accepted tool for describing light
transmission through disordered devices. We find that the reason for such
improved performance could be due to the fact that the hardware classifier
operates in a flatter region of the loss landscape when trained on fiber data,
which aligns with the current theory of deep neural networks. These findings
strongly suggest that multi-mode fibers possess robust generalization
properties, positioning them as promising tools for optically-assisted neural
networks. With this study, in fact, we want to contribute to advancing the
knowledge and practical utilization of these versatile instruments, which may
play a significant role in shaping the future of machine learning.

Furthermore, we preface the presentation of these results with a comprehensive
introduction suitable for master's or PhD students. Thereby, we hope to

  The thesis comprises a second topic, in which we provide ideas for setting up
quantum lattice systems in order to prove exponential estimates for the

attracted extensive attention since it provides a possibility to realize higher
sensing accuracy. However, current works mainly concentrate on sensing
scenarios where the line-of-sight (LoS) path exists, which significantly limits
their applications. To address the problem, we propose an enhanced mmWave
sensing algorithm in the 3D non-line-of-sight environment (mm3NLoS), aiming to
sense the direction and distance of the target when the LoS path is weak or
blocked. Specifically, we first adopt the directional beam to estimate the
azimuth/elevation angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD) of the
reflection path. Then, the distance of the related path is measured by the fine
timing measurement protocol. Finally, we transform the AoA and AoD of the
multiple non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths into the direction vector and then
obtain the information of targets based on the geometric relationship. The
simulation results demonstrate that mm3NLoS can achieve a centimeter-level
error with a 2m spacing. Compared to the prior work, it can significantly
reduce the performance degradation under the NLoS condition.

these neutrinos at DUNE have been carried out. It has been shown that if the
WIMP mass is below 4 GeV, then they will evaporate prior to annihilation,
suppressing the signal. Since Jupiter has a cooler core, WIMPs with masses in
the 1-4 GeV range will not evaporate and can thus annihilate into monoenergetic
neutrinos. We calculate the flux of these neutrinos near the surface of Jupiter
and find that it is comparable to the flux at DUNE for masses above 4 GeV and
substantially greater in the 1-4 GeV range. Of course, detecting these

experiments find a WIMP with a mass in the 1-4 GeV range, it may be one of the
few ways to learn about the annihilation process. A liquid hydrogen time

applications in recent years. These models explicitly build in the reflection,

large advances in accuracy and data efficiency for a range of applications in
the physical sciences. An outstanding question for equivariant models is why
they achieve such larger-than-expected advances in these applications. To probe
this question, we examine the role of higher order (non-scalar) features in
Euclidean Neural Networks (\texttt{e3nn}). We focus on the previously studied
application of \texttt{e3nn} to the problem of electron density prediction,
which allows for a variety of non-scalar outputs, and examine whether the
nature of the output (scalar $l=0$, vector $l=1$, or higher order $l>1$) is
relevant to the effectiveness of non-scalar hidden features in the network.
Further, we examine the behavior of non-scalar features throughout training,
finding a natural hierarchy of features by $l$, reminiscent of a multipole
expansion. We aim for our work to ultimately inform design principles and
choices of domain applications for {\tt e3nn} networks.

provide powerful tests of general relativity (GR), but systematic errors in
data analysis could lead to incorrect scientific conclusions. This issue is
especially serious in the third-generation GW detectors in which the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high and the number of detections is large. In
this work, we investigate the impacts of overlapping signals and inaccurate
waveform models on tests of GR. We simulate mock catalogs for Einstein
Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and perform parametric tests of GR using waveform
models with different levels of inaccuracy. We find the systematic error in
non-GR parameter estimates could accumulate toward a false deviation from GR
when combining results from multiple events, although a bayesian model
selection analysis may not favour a deviation. Waveform inaccuracies contribute
most to the systematic errors, but multiple overlapping signals could magnify
the effects of systematics due to the incorrect removal of signals. We also
point out that testing GR using selected ''golden binaries'' with high SNR is
even more vulnerable to false deviations from GR. The problem of error
accumulation is universal; we emphasize that it must be addressed to fully
exploit the data from third-generation GW detectors, and that further
investigations, particularly in waveform accuracy, will be essential.

simply reading the sensor system at a frame rate that matches the ground

this technique, the platform freezes out its movement concerning the ground,
reducing the demands placed on the attitude control systems, which can

though dealing with demand uncertainty in resource allocation problems has been

is inspired by the problem of allocating units of a new resource (e.g., newly

our competitive ratio of $1-\Theta(1/(p\sqrt{m}))$ is tight for any $p

slow spectral dynamics that destabilize qubit lifetimes on hour timescales.
Stability is also threatened at millisecond timescales, where ionizing
radiation has recently been found to cause bursts of correlated multi-qubit
decays, complicating quantum error correction. Here we study both ionizing
radiation and TLS dynamics on a 27-qubit processor, repurposing the standard
transmon qubits as sensors of both radiation impacts and TLS dynamics. Unlike
prior literature, we observe resilience of the qubit lifetimes to the transient
quasiparticles generated by the impact of radiation. However, we also observe a
new interaction between these two processes, ""TLS scrambling,"" in which a
radiation impact causes multiple TLSs to jump in frequency, which we suggest is
due to the same charge rearrangement sensed by qubits near a radiation impact.
As TLS scrambling brings TLSs out of or in to resonance with the qubit, the
lifetime of the qubit increases or decreases. Our findings thus identify
radiation as a new contribution to fluctuations in qubit lifetimes, with
implications for efforts to characterize and improve device stability

velocity dispersion in the DIG is higher than in the HII regions, which can be
explained by the DIG being 1.8 kK hotter than HII gas. The DIG manifests a
lower ionization parameter than HII gas, and the DIG fractions vary between
15-77%, with strong evidence of a contribution by hot low-mass evolved stars

variety with quotient singularities lifts to a resolution. As a consequence, we
prove that a variety $X$ of dimension $d$ with a smooth marked point $p$ such
that $\operatorname{Aut}(X,p)$ is finite, \'etale and of degree prime to $d!$
is defined over its field of moduli.

While such methods have proven to be remarkably useful in the analysis of

to accurately approximate fundamentally nonlinear behaviors. This issue poses
an inherent risk of overfitting to training data thereby limiting predictive
capabilities. By contrast, this work explores strategies for nonlinear

strategies that yield nonlinear models are presented for systems both with and

provide short-term predictions for the observable dynamics while comparable

a self-Kerr nonlinearity $U$, and decay rate $\kappa$ from the ancilla and

modifying the hybridization conditions and thus the properties of the readout
polariton modes. Using this, the hybridisation is tuned in the mesoscopic
regime of the non-linear dissipative polariton where the self-Kerr and decay
rates of one polariton are similar $U\sim \kappa$ leading to bistability and

phenomenological: the quasiparticle properties are found from experiment, and
controversies over their description still remain, notably regarding vortex
dynamics and the nature of rotons and roton pair creation. It is therefore
important to develop new experimental tools for probing the system far from

superfluid helium through the excitation of roton pairs with ultrashort laser
pulses. By measuring the time dependence of this perturbation, we track the
non-equilibrium evolution of the two-roton states on a picosecond timescale.
Our results reveal an ultrafast cooling of hot roton pairs as they thermalize
with the colder gas of other quasiparticles. We anticipate that these findings,
as well as future applications of the introduced ultrafast laser technique to
different temperature and pressure regimes in bulk liquid 4He, will stimulate
further experimental and theoretical investigations towards better

reference-model-assisted DRL approach. We introduce definitions of the
reference model, reference-model-based optimization, and reference actions. The
reference-model-assisted DRL learns the residual actions between the reference
actions and optimal actions, rather than learning the optimal actions directly.
Since the residual actions are considerably smaller than the optimal actions
for a reference model, we can design a smaller action space for the
reference-model-assisted DRL. It reduces the learning difficulties of DRL and
optimises the performance of the reference-model-assisted DRL approach. It is
noteworthy that the reference-model-assisted DRL approach is compatible with
any policy gradient DRL algorithms for continuous action problems. This work
takes the soft actor-critic algorithm as an example and designs a
reference-model-assisted soft actor-critic algorithm. Simulations show that 1)
large action space degrades the performance of DRL in the whole training stage,
and 2) reference-model-assisted DRL requires fewer iteration times and returns
a better optimization performance.

components in complex networks and reveal underlying relationships among
components. As a special type of networks, spatial networks are usually
generated by the connections among geographic regions. Identifying the spatial
network communities can help reveal the spatial interaction patterns,
understand the hidden regional structures and support regional development
decision-making. Given the recent development of Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN) and its powerful performance in identifying multi-scale spatial
interactions, we proposed an unsupervised GCN-based community detection method
""region2vec"" on spatial networks. Our method first generates node embeddings
for regions that share common attributes and have intense spatial interactions,
and then applies clustering algorithms to detect communities based on their
embedding similarity and spatial adjacency. Experimental results show that
while existing methods trade off either attribute similarities or spatial
interactions for one another, ""region2vec"" maintains a great balance between
both and performs the best when one wants to maximize both attribute
similarities and spatial interactions within communities.

metrics that measure the node-level and network-level dependence of
single-sourcing, distant, or non-adjacent suppliers/customers in food supply

  Humans and AI",,,,,"econ.GN cs.CY q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  I study the role of minimum wage as an anchor for judgements of the fairness
of wages by both human subjects and artificial intelligence (AI). Through
surveys of human subjects enrolled in the crowdsourcing platform Prolific.co
and queries submitted to the OpenAI's language model GPT-3, I test whether the
numerical response for what wage is deemed fair for a particular job
description changes when respondents and GPT-3 are prompted with additional
information that includes a numerical minimum wage, whether realistic or
unrealistic, relative to a control where no minimum wage is stated. I find that
the minimum wage influences the distribution of responses for the wage
considered fair by shifting the mean response toward the minimum wage, thus
establishing the minimum wage's role as an anchor for judgements of fairness.
However, for unrealistically high minimum wages, namely $50 and $100, the
distribution of responses splits into two distinct modes, one that
approximately follows the anchor and one that remains close to the control,
albeit with an overall upward shift towards the anchor. The anchor exerts a
similar effect on the AI bot; however, the wage that the AI bot perceives as
fair exhibits a systematic downward shift compared to human subjects'
responses. For unrealistic values of the anchor, the responses of the bot also
split into two modes but with a smaller proportion of the responses adhering to
the anchor compared to human subjects. As with human subjects, the remaining
responses are close to the control group for the AI bot but also exhibit a
systematic shift towards the anchor. During experimentation, I noted some
variability in the bot responses depending on small perturbations of the
prompt, so I also test variability in the bot's responses with respect to more
meaningful differences in gender and race cues in the prompt, finding anomalies
in the distribution of responses.

challenging, time-consuming, and vulnerable to misinterpretation. This paper
describes a classification model for movie reviews founded on deep learning
approaches. Almost 500KB pairs of balanced data from the IMDb movie review
databases are employed to train the model. People's perspectives regarding
movies were classified using both the long short-term memory (LSTM) and
convolutional neural network (CNN) strategies. According to the findings, the
CNN algorithm's prediction accuracy rate would be almost 97.4%. Furthermore,
the model trained by LSTM resulted in accuracies of around and applying 99.2%
within the Keras library. The model is investigated more by modification of
model parameters. According to the outcomes, LTSM outperforms CNN in assessing
IMDb movie reviews and is computationally less costly than LSTM.

the movement of humans, animals and objects, revealing patterns of movement,
hot spots and overlaps among others. This information is obtained after
cleaning the data from errors of different natures. However, in the case of
Automated Information Systems (AIS), attached to vessels, these errors can come
from intentional manipulation of the electronic device. Thus, the analysis of
anomalies can provide valuable information on suspicious behaviour. Here, we
analyse anomalies of fishing vessel trajectories obtained with the Automatic
Identification System. The map of silence anomalies, those occurring when
positioning data is absent for more than 24 h, shows that they occur more
likely closer to land, observing 94.9% of the anomalies at less than 100 km
from the shore. This behaviour suggests the potential of identifying silence
anomalies as a proxy for illegal activities. With the increasing availability
of high-resolution positioning of vessels and the development of powerful
statistical analytical tools, we provide hints on the automatic detection of
illegal activities that may help optimise monitoring, control and surveillance
measures.

amplitude model. We compare the performance of our approach against a vanilla
DRL agent in two scenarios: perfect CSI and phase-dependent RIS amplitudes, and
mismatched CSI and ideal RIS reflections. The results demonstrate that the
proposed framework significantly outperforms the vanilla DRL agent under
mismatch and approaches the golden standard. Our contributions include
modifications to the DRL approach to address the joint design of transmit
beamforming and phase shifts and the phase-dependent amplitude model. To the
best of our knowledge, our method is the first DRL-based approach for the
