large-charge limit allowing to compute correlators via a semiclassical
expansion in the inverse powers of the conserved charges. A generalization of
the approach to gauge symmetries has faced the problem of defining
gauge-independent observables and, therefore, has not been developed so far. We
employ the large-charge expansion to calculate the scaling dimension of the
lowest-lying operators carrying $U(1)$ charge $Q$ in the critical Abelian Higgs
model in $D=4-\epsilon$ dimensions to leading and next-to-leading orders in the
charge and all orders in the $\epsilon$ expansion. Remarkably, the results
match our independent diagrammatic computation of the three-loop scaling
dimension of the operator $\phi^Q(x)$ in the Landau gauge. We argue that this
matching is a consequence of the equivalence between the gauge-independent
dressed two-point function of Dirac type with the gauge-dependent two-point
function of $\phi^Q(x)$ in the Landau gauge. We, therefore, shed new light on
the problem of defining gauge-independent exponents which has been
controversial in the literature on critical superconductors as well as lay the
foundation for large-charge methods in gauge theories.

widened the application horizons of distributed sensor networks, ranging from
smart home appliances to automation, including remote sensing. Typically, these
distributed systems are composed of several nodes attached to sensing devices
linked by a heterogeneous communication network. The unreliable nature of these
systems (e.g., devices might run out of energy or communications might become
unavailable) drives practitioners to implement heavyweight fault tolerance
mechanisms to identify those untrustworthy nodes that are misbehaving
erratically and, thus, ensure that the sensed data from the IoT domain are
correct. The overhead in the communication network degrades the overall system,
especially in scenarios with limited available bandwidth that are exposed to
severely harsh conditions. Quantum Internet might be a promising alternative to
minimize traffic congestion and avoid worsening reliability due to the link
saturation effect by using a quantum consensus layer. In this regard, the
purpose of this paper is to explore and simulate the usage of quantum consensus
architecture in one of the most challenging natural environments in the world
where researchers need a responsive sensor network: the remote sensing of
permafrost in Antarctica. More specifically, this paper 1) describes the use
case of permafrost remote sensing in Antarctica, 2) proposes the usage of a
quantum consensus management plane to reduce the traffic overhead associated
with fault tolerance protocols, and 3) discusses, by means of simulation,
possible improvements to increase the trustworthiness of a holistic telemetry

Using our revised Tripp estimator, the effect on cosmological parameters from

phonons of the ionic lattice, leading to the formation of polaron
quasiparticles. The optical conductivity and optical absorption spectrum of a
material are affected by this electron-phonon coupling, most notably leading to
an absorption peak in the mid-infrared region. Recently, a model Hamiltonian
for anharmonic electron-phonon coupling was derived [M. Houtput and J. Tempere,
Phys. Rev. B \textbf{103}, 184306 (2021)], that includes both the conventional
Fr\""ohlich interaction as well an interaction where an electron interacts with
two phonons simultaneously. In this article, we calculate and investigate the
optical conductivity of the anharmonic large polaron gas, and show that an
additional characteristic absorption peak appears due to this
1-electron-2-phonon interaction.
  We calculate a semi-analytical expression for the optical conductivity
$\sigma(\omega)$ at finite temperatures and weak coupling using the Kubo
formula. The electronic and phononic contributions can be split and treated
separately, such that the many-body effects of the electron gas may be taken
into account through the well-known dynamical structure factor
$S(\mathbf{k},\omega)$. From the resulting optical conductivity, we calculate
the polaron effective mass, an estimate for the electron-phonon scattering
times, and the optical absorption spectrum of the anharmonic polaron gas. We
show that alongside the well-known polaron absorption peak at the phonon energy
$\hbar \omega_{\text{LO}}$, the 1-electron-2-phonon interaction leads to an
additional absorption peak at $2 \hbar \omega_{\text{LO}}$. We propose this
absorption peak as an experimentally measurable indicator for nonnegligible
1-electron-2-phonon interaction in a material, since the height of this peak is
proportional to the strength of this anharmonic interaction.

a 200-nm Nb layer M6 in the standard SFQ5ee process with nine superconducting

shielding and low intralayer mutual coupling. A two-step patterning of the top
Nb and the bottom NbN layers of the NbN/Nb bilayer allows to create inductors
in a very wide range of linear inductance values, from low values ~ 0.4
pH/$\mu$m typical for Nb geometrical inductors to ~ 35 pH/$\mu$m typical to
thin-film kinetic inductors. Mutual inductance of NbN and Nb inductors, of NbN
inductors, and of bilayer inductors is the same as between two Nb inductors
with the same geometry and placement between the ground planes, i.e., mutual
inductance does not depend on superconducting properties of the signal traces
in the studied range of linewidths. We measured magnetic field penetration
depth and kinetic inductance of NbN films with thickness t=200 nm to be
$\lambda$ = 491+/-5 nm and 1.51 pH/sq, and 2.06 pH/sq at t=150 nm. The kinetic
inductance was found to be larger than that expected for superconductors with
short mean free path, indicating a reduction in the superfluid density, likely
due to carrier localization effects. Kinetic inductance associated with
right-angled bends of the NbN inductors is negligible at linewidths
$w<{\lambda}^2/t$, indicating a very small current crowding in structures with
superconducting ground plane(s). Implementation of NbN and NbN/Nb inductors can
significantly increase integration scale of superconductor digital electronics.

adjustments. The algorithm is used to simulate simple models of the Milky Way
with the Hubble expansion of the universe, and the galaxies are simulated for
times which corresponds to more than 25 Gyr. The rotating galaxies lose bound
objects from time to time, but they are still stable at the end of the
simulations. The simulations indicate that the explanation for the dynamics of
galaxies may be that the universe is very young in cosmological times. Although
the models of the Milky Way are rather stable at 13-14 Gyr, which corresponds
to the cosmological time of the universe, the Hubble expansion will sooner or
later release the objects in the galaxies. But the simulations indicate that
this will first happen in a far away future.

two-dimensional systems where quantum mechanical effects dominate such as
P:$\delta$-layers - atomically thin sheets of phosphorus dopants in silicon
that induce novel electronic properties beyond traditional doping. Previously
it was shown that P:$\delta$-layers produce a distinct Drude tail feature in
ellipsometry measurements. However, the ellipsometric spectra could not be
properly fit by modeling the $\delta$-layer as discrete layer of classical
Drude metal. In particular, even for large broadening corresponding to
extremely short relaxation times, a plasma resonance feature was anticipated
but not evident in the experimental data. In this work, we develop a physically
accurate description of this system, which reveals a general approach to
designing thin films with intentionally suppressed plasma resonances. Our model
takes into account the strong charge density confinement and resulting quantum
mechanical description of a P:$\delta$-layer. We show that the absence of a
plasma resonance feature results from a combination of two factors: i), the
sharply varying charge density profile due to strong confinement in the
direction of growth; and ii), the effective mass and relaxation time anisotropy
due to valley degeneracy. The plasma resonance reappears when the atoms
composing the $\delta$-layer are allowed to diffuse out from the plane of the
layer, destroying its well-confined two-dimensional character that is critical
to its novel electronic properties.

Calabi-Yau threefold famously jumps across codimension-one walls in
complexified K\""ahler moduli space, leading to an intricate chamber structure.
The Split Attractor Flow Conjecture posits that the BPS index
$\Omega_z(\gamma)$ for given charge $\gamma$ and moduli $z$ can be
reconstructed from the attractor indices $\Omega_*(\gamma_i)$ counting BPS
states of charge $\gamma_i$ in their respective attractor chamber, by summing
over a finite set of decorated rooted flow trees known as attractor flow trees.
If correct, this provides a classification (or dendroscopy) of the BPS spectrum
into different topologies of nested BPS bound states, each having a simple
chamber structure. Here we investigate this conjecture for the simplest, albeit
non-compact, Calabi-Yau threefold, namely the canonical bundle over the
projective plane $P^2$. Since the K\""ahler moduli space has complex dimension
one and the attractor flow preserves the argument of the central charge,
attractor flow trees coincide with scattering sequences of rays in a
two-dimensional slice of the scattering diagram in the space of stability
conditions on the derived category of compactly supported coherent sheaves on
$K_{P^2}$. We combine previous results on the scattering diagram of $K_{P^2}$

$\Gamma_1(3)$ of auto-equivalences, only a finite number of possible
decompositions $\gamma=\sum_i\gamma_i$ contribute to the index
$\Omega_z(\gamma)$ for any $\gamma$ and $z$, with constituents $\gamma_i$

pre-training paradigm. A pretext task is constructed by masking patches in an
input image, and this masked content is then predicted by a neural network
using visible patches as sole input. This pre-training leads to
state-of-the-art performance when finetuned for high-level semantic tasks, e.g.
image classification and object detection. In this paper we instead seek to
learn representations that transfer well to a wide variety of 3D vision and
lower-level geometric downstream tasks, such as depth prediction or optical
flow estimation. Inspired by MIM, we propose an unsupervised representation
learning task trained from pairs of images showing the same scene from
different viewpoints. More precisely, we propose the pretext task of cross-view
completion where the first input image is partially masked, and this masked
content has to be reconstructed from the visible content and the second image.
In single-view MIM, the masked content often cannot be inferred precisely from
the visible portion only, so the model learns to act as a prior influenced by
high-level semantics. In contrast, this ambiguity can be resolved with
cross-view completion from the second unmasked image, on the condition that the
model is able to understand the spatial relationship between the two images.
Our experiments show that our pretext task leads to significantly improved
performance for monocular 3D vision downstream tasks such as depth estimation.
In addition, our model can be directly applied to binocular downstream tasks
like optical flow or relative camera pose estimation, for which we obtain
competitive results without bells and whistles, i.e., using a generic
architecture without any task-specific design.

approaches and the large number of -- often difficult -- measurements required

requirements scale linearly with subsystem dimension (scaling with the
square-root of the system dimension) and which requires only a single complex
measurement. The certification method places a lower-bound on the relative

a sequence of operators representing graphs, Cauchy with respect to the action

large class of graph sequences whose only uniformly bounded $(p,q)$-norm is the
$(\infty,1)$-norm, but which converge nonetheless. We show that the limit
operators in this case are not unique, not self-adjoint, and need not be

means that the space of graphops is not compact. By identifying these multiple

several serialization methods including templates, table-to-text models, and
large language models. Despite its simplicity, we find that this technique
outperforms prior deep-learning-based tabular classification methods on several
benchmark datasets. In most cases, even zero-shot classification obtains
non-trivial performance, illustrating the method's ability to exploit prior
knowledge encoded in large language models. Unlike many deep learning methods
for tabular datasets, this approach is also competitive with strong traditional
baselines like gradient-boosted trees, especially in the very-few-shot setting.

two rational cubes, and a positive proportion are not so expressible. More
generally, we prove that a positive proportion (in fact, at least one sixth) of
elliptic curves in any cubic twist family have rank $0$, and a positive

at $2$ in any cubic twist family have rank $1$.
  Our method involves proving that the average size of the $2$-Selmer group of
elliptic curves in any cubic twist family, having any given root number, is
$3$. We accomplish this by generalizing a parametrization, due to the second
author and Ho, of elliptic curves with extra structure by pairs of binary cubic
forms. We then count integer points satisfying suitable congruence conditions
on a quadric hypersurface in the space of real pairs of binary cubic forms in a
fundamental domain for the action of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\times
\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, using a combination of geometry-of-numbers methods
and the circle method, building on earlier work of Ruth and the first author.
We give a new interpretation of the singular integral and singular series
arising in the circle method in terms of real and $p$-adic integrals with
respect to Haar measure on the relevant group $\mathrm{SL}_2\times
\mathrm{SL}_2$. A uniformity estimate and sieve then shows that the average
size of the $2$-Selmer group over the full cubic twist family is $3$. After
suitably partitioning the subset of curves in the family with given root
number, we execute a further sieve to show that the root number is
equidistributed and that the same average, now taken over only those curves of
given root number, is also $3$. Finally, we apply the $p$-parity theorem of
Dokchitser--Dokchitser and a $p$-converse theorem of Burungale--Skinner to
conclude.

  Computations",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The training of graph neural networks (GNNs) is extremely time consuming
because sparse graph-based operations are hard to be accelerated by hardware.
Prior art explores trading off the computational precision to reduce the time
complexity via sampling-based approximation. Based on the idea, previous works
successfully accelerate the dense matrix based operations (e.g., convolution
and linear) with negligible accuracy drop. However, unlike dense matrices,
sparse matrices are stored in the irregular data format such that each
row/column may have different number of non-zero entries. Thus, compared to the
dense counterpart, approximating sparse operations has two unique challenges
(1) we cannot directly control the efficiency of approximated sparse operation
since the computation is only executed on non-zero entries; (2) sub-sampling
sparse matrices is much more inefficient due to the irregular data format. To
address the issues, our key idea is to control the accuracy-efficiency trade
off by optimizing computation resource allocation layer-wisely and
epoch-wisely. Specifically, for the first challenge, we customize the
computation resource to different sparse operations, while limit the total used
resource below a certain budget. For the second challenge, we cache previous
sampled sparse matrices to reduce the epoch-wise sampling overhead. Finally, we
propose a switching mechanisms to improve the generalization of GNNs trained
with approximated operations. To this end, we propose Randomized Sparse
Computation, which for the first time demonstrate the potential of training
GNNs with approximated operations. In practice, rsc can achieve up to
$11.6\times$ speedup for a single sparse operation and a $1.6\times$ end-to-end
wall-clock time speedup with negligible accuracy drop.

Survey MAIN galaxy sample to calculate the luminosity-density field and get

galaxy properties. We divide groups into low- and high-luminosity groups based
on the highest luminosity of groups in the watershed region, $L_{gr} = 15

strongly related to the richness of galaxy groups. Its influence on the overall
star formation quenching in galaxies is less strong. Correlations between the
morphological properties of galaxies and the global density field are the
weakest. The watershed regions are populated mostly by single galaxies (70% of
all galaxies there), and by low-luminosity groups. Still, approximately
one-third of all galaxies in the watershed regions are VO galaxies. They have
lower stellar masses, smaller stellar velocity dispersions, and stellar
populations that are up to 2Gyr younger than those of VO galaxies in other
global environments. In higher density global environments, the morphological
properties of galaxies are very similar. Differences in galaxy properties are
the largest between satellites and brightest group galaxies. Our results
suggest that galaxy evolution is determined by the birthplace of galaxies in
the cosmic web, and mainly by internal processes which lead to the present-day
properties of galaxies. This may explain the similarity of (VO) galaxies in

  Distribution Shifts","Published in ICML 2023",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine learning models frequently experience performance drops under
distribution shifts. The underlying cause of such shifts may be multiple
simultaneous factors such as changes in data quality, differences in specific
covariate distributions, or changes in the relationship between label and
features. When a model does fail during deployment, attributing performance
change to these factors is critical for the model developer to identify the
root cause and take mitigating actions. In this work, we introduce the problem
of attributing performance differences between environments to distribution
shifts in the underlying data generating mechanisms. We formulate the problem
as a cooperative game where the players are distributions. We define the value
of a set of distributions to be the change in model performance when only this
set of distributions has changed between environments, and derive an importance
weighting method for computing the value of an arbitrary set of distributions.
The contribution of each distribution to the total performance change is then
quantified as its Shapley value. We demonstrate the correctness and utility of
our method on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world case studies, showing
its effectiveness in attributing performance changes to a wide range of
distribution shifts.

breaking degeneracies between the effects of star spots and limb-darkening.
Including star spots reduces the derived radii by $\sim$2\% from an unspotted

their application to inflationary EFTs is subtle since Lorentz invariance is

all fields obey a dispersion relation that is approximately lightlike. We then
apply the formalism to various classes of inflationary EFTs, with and without

different classes. Through the Buchdahl transformation, the class-I and
class-II solutions are dual to the topological Schwarzschild-Tangherlini-(A)dS
solution and one of the $\Lambda$-vacuum direct-product solutions,
respectively. While the metric of the spherically symmetric class-I solution is
$C^\infty$ at the Killing horizon for $n=4$ and $5$, it is $C^1$ for $n\ge 6$
and then the Killing horizon turns to be a parallelly propagated curvature
singularity. For $n=4$ and $5$, the spherically symmetric class-I solution can
be attached to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini vacuum black hole with the same
value of the mass parameter at the Killing horizon in a regular manner, namely
without a lightlike massive thin-shell. This construction allows new
configurations of an asymptotically (locally) flat black hole to emerge. If a
static perfect fluid hovers outside a vacuum black hole, its energy density is
negative. In contrast, if the dynamical region inside the event horizon of a
vacuum black hole is replaced by the class-I solution, the corresponding matter
field is an anisotropic fluid and may satisfy the null and strong energy
conditions. While the latter configuration always involves a spacelike
singularity inside the horizon for $n=4$, it becomes a non-singular black hole
of the big-bounce type for $n=5$ if the ADM mass is larger than a critical
value.

of this platform, we propose a protocol for quantum non-demolition (QND) photon

observation phase consisting of a series of Rabi flops to a Rydberg state and

a Rydberg excitation after oscillating for some time is thus a weak measurement

been the simulation of increasingly complex physical systems. Prior to
fault-tolerant quantum computing, robust error mitigation strategies are
necessary to continue this growth. Here, we study physical simulation within
the seniority-zero electron pairing subspace, which affords both a
computational stepping stone to a fully correlated model, and an opportunity to
validate recently introduced ``purification-based'' error-mitigation
strategies. We compare the performance of error mitigation based on doubling
quantum resources in time (echo verification) or in space (virtual
distillation), on up to $20$ qubits of a superconducting qubit quantum
processor. We observe a reduction of error by one to two orders of magnitude
below less sophisticated techniques (e.g. post-selection); the gain from error
mitigation is seen to increase with the system size. Employing these error
mitigation strategies enables the implementation of the largest variational
algorithm for a correlated chemistry system to-date. Extrapolating performance
from these results allows us to estimate minimum requirements for a
beyond-classical simulation of electronic structure. We find that, despite the
impressive gains from purification-based error mitigation, significant hardware
improvements will be required for classically intractable variational chemistry
simulations.

neutrino masses and origin of matter in the universe within a unified picture.
The mixing, effectively described by a dimension five operator, is responsible
both for the production of dark neutrinos, converting a small fraction of
seesaw neutrinos acting as source, and for their decays. We show that including
the production of source neutrinos from Higgs portal interactions, their
abundance can thermalise prior to the onset of source-dark neutrino
oscillations, resulting into an enhanced production of dark neutrinos that thus
can play the role of decaying dark matter (DM) for a much higher seesaw scale.
This can be above the sphaleron freeze-out temperature and as high as $\sim
100\,{\rm TeV}$, so that strong thermal resonant leptogenesis for the
generation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry is viable. We obtain a $\sim
1\,{\rm TeV}$--$1\,{\rm PeV}$ allowed dark neutrino mass range. Intriguingly,
their decays can also explain a neutrino flux excess at ${\cal O}(100\,{\rm
TeV})$ energies recently confirmed by the IceCube collaboration analysing 7.5yr
HESE data. Our results also point to an effective scale for Higgs portal
interactions nicely identifiable with the grandunified scale and many orders of
magnitude below the effective scale for the mixing. We explain this hierarchy
in a UV-complete model with a very heavy fermion as mediator: the first scale
corresponds to the fundamental scale of new physics, while the second is much
higher because of a very small coupling identifiable with a symmetry breaking
parameter. Therefore, RHINO realises a simple unified model of neutrino masses
and origin of matter in the universe currently under scrutiny at neutrino
telescopes and potentially embeddable within a grandunified model.

at z ~ 1 is qualitatively different to that in the local Universe. However, the
physical origin of these differences has not yet been elucidated. In addition,
while low-redshift comparisons between observed environmental trends and the
predictions of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are now routine, there
have been relatively few comparisons at higher redshifts to date. Here we
confront three state-of-the-art suites of simulations (BAHAMAS+MACSIS,
EAGLE+Hydrangea, IllustrisTNG) with state-of-the-art observations of the field
and cluster environments from the COSMOS/UltraVISTA and GOGREEN surveys,
respectively, at z ~ 1 to assess the realism of the simulations and gain
insight into the evolution of environmental quenching. We show that while the
simulations generally reproduce the stellar content and the stellar mass
functions of quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the field, all the
simulations struggle to capture the observed quenching of satellites in the
cluster environment, in that they are overly efficient at quenching low-mass
satellites. Furthermore, two of the suites do not sufficiently quench the
highest-mass galaxies in clusters, perhaps a result of insufficient feedback
from AGN. The origin of the discrepancy at low stellar masses (Mstar <~ 1E10
Msun), which is present in all the simulations in spite of large differences in
resolution, feedback implementations, and hydrodynamical solvers, is unclear.
The next generation of simulations, which will push to significantly higher
resolution and also include explicit modelling of the cold interstellar medium,
may help to shed light on the low-mass tension.

quantum information science and many-body quantum physics, while remaining

in deterministic circuits with similar applications, we construct classes of
\textit{nonrandom} unitary Clifford circuits by imposing translation invariance
in both time and space. Further imposing dual-unitarity, our circuits
effectively become crystalline spacetime lattices whose vertices are SWAP or
iSWAP two-qubit gates and whose edges may contain one-qubit gates. One can then
require invariance under (subgroups of) the crystal's point group. Working on
the square and kagome lattices, we use the formalism of Clifford quantum
cellular automata to describe operator spreading, entanglement generation, and
recurrence times of these circuits. A full classification on the square lattice
reveals, of particular interest, a ""non-fractal good scrambling class"" with
dense operator spreading that generates codes with linear contiguous code
distance and high performance under erasure errors at the end of the circuit.
We also break unitarity by adding spacetime-translation-invariant measurements
and find a class of such circuits with fractal dynamics.

one-dimensional (1D) spin-polarised surface states that may one day be used in
spintronic devices. In this work, two such states have been observed for the
(112) surface when measured using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) and spin-resolved ARPES, and when calculated using a tight-binding (TB)
model and with density functional theory (DFT). The surface states appear as
elongated Dirac-cones which are 1D and almost dispersionless in the
${k}_{\text{y}}$-direction, but disperse with energy in the orthogonal
${k}_{\text{x}}$-direction to form two ``$\times$''-like features centered at
the ${k}_{\text{y}}$-line through ${\Gamma}$. Unlike many materials considered
for spintronic applications, their 1D nature suggests that conductivity and
spin-transport properties are highly dependent on direction. The
spin-polarisation of the surface states is mainly in-plane and parallel to the
1D state, but there are signs of a tilted out-of-plane spin-component for one
of them. The Bi(112) surface states resemble those found for other vicinal
surfaces of bismuth, strongly indicating that their existence and general
properties are robust properties of vicinal surfaces of bismuth. Furthermore,
differences in the details of the states, particularly related to their
spin-polarisation, suggest that spin-transport properties may be engineered
simply by precise cutting and polishing of the crystal.

  Machine Learning Algorithm","17 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an expansion of FLEET, a machine learning algorithm optimized to
select transients that are most likely to be tidal disruption events (TDEs).
FLEET is based on a random forest algorithm trained on the light curves and
host galaxy information of 4,779 spectroscopically classified transients. For
transients with a probability of being a TDE, \ptde$>0.5$, we can successfully
recover TDEs with a $\approx40$\% completeness and a $\approx30$\% purity when
using the first 20 days of photometry, or a similar completeness and
$\approx50$\% purity when including 40 days of photometry. We find that the
most relevant features for differentiating TDEs from other transients are the
normalized host separation, and the light curve $(g-r)$ color during peak.
Additionally, we use FLEET to produce a list of the 39 most likely TDE
candidates discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility that remain currently
unclassified. We explore the use of FLEET for the Legacy Survey of Space and
Time on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (\textit{Rubin}) and the \textit{Nancy
Grace Roman Space Telescope} (\textit{Roman}). We simulate the \textit{Rubin}
and \textit{Roman} survey strategies and estimate that $\sim 10^4$ TDEs could
be discovered every year by \textit{Rubin}, and $\sim200$ TDEs per year by
\textit{Roman}. Finally, we run FLEET on the TDEs in our \textit{Rubin} survey
simulation and find that we can recover $\sim 30$\% of those at a redshift $z
<0.5$ with \ptde$>0.5$. This translates to $\sim3,000$ TDEs per year that FLEET
could uncover from \textit{Rubin}. FLEET is provided as a open source package

identified worldwide between November 2019 and January 2022. Based on our
original algorithm, we anticipated that FLEET would achieve a purity of about
50\% for transients with a probability of being a SLSN, \pslsn$>0.5$; the true
on-sky purity we obtained is closer to 80\%. Similarly, we anticipated FLEET
could reach a completeness of about 30\%, and we indeed measure an upper limit
on the completeness of $\approx 33$\%. Here, we present FLEET 2.0, an updated
version of FLEET trained on 4,780 transients (almost 3 times more than in FLEET
1.0). FLEET 2.0 has a similar predicted purity to FLEET 1.0, but outperforms
FLEET 1.0 in terms of completeness, which is now closer to $\approx 40$\% for
transients with \pslsn$>0.5$. Additionally, we explore possible systematics
that might arise from the use of FLEET for target selection. We find that the
population of SLSNe recovered by FLEET is mostly indistinguishable from the
overall SLSN population, in terms of physical and most observational
parameters. We provide FLEET as an open source package on GitHub

eternal or semi-eternal acceleration, whereas others allow for a parametric

large volume and weak string coupling. Moreover, we find several smooth
accelerating cosmologies without Big Bang singularities: the universe is
contracting in the cosmological past ($T<0$), expanding in the future ($T>0$),

protostellar disks (PSDs) based on diffusion and viscosity coefficients
measured from 3D global stratified-disk simulations with a Lagrangian
hydrodynamic method. While gas-drag tend to transport dust species radially
inwards, stochastic diffusion can spread a considerable fraction of dust
radially outwards (upstream) depending on the nature of turbulence. In
gravitationally unstable disks, we measure a high radial diffusion coefficient
Dr with little dependence on altitude. This leads to strong and vertically
homogeneous upstream diffusion in early PSDs. In the solar nebula, the robust
upstream diffusion of micron to mm size grains not only efficiently transports
highly refractory mocron-size grains (such as those identified in the samples
of comet 81P/Wild 2) from their regions of formation inside the snow line out
to the Kuiper Belt, but can also spread mm-size CAI formed in the stellar
proximity to distances where they can be assimilated into chondritic
meteorites. In disks dominated by magnetorotational instability (MRI), the
upstream diffusion effect is generally milder, with a separating feature due to
diffusion being stronger in the surface layer than the midplane. This variation
becomes much more pronounced if we additionally consider a quiescent midplane
with lower turbulence and larger characteristic dust size due to non-ideal MHD
effects. This segregation scenario helps to account for dichotomy of two dust
populations' spatial distribution as observed in scattered light and ALMA
images.

introduce a new experimental framework that allows us to smoothly vary task
constrainedness, from MT at one end to fully open-ended generation at the

decreases smoothly with constrainedness, explaining the difference in
repetition across tasks; (2) length bias surprisingly also decreases with
constrainedness, suggesting some other cause for the difference in length bias;
(3) across the board, these problems affect the mode, not the whole

Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) method with Tree-structured Parzen
Estimator (TPE) technique for imbalanced tabular datasets. Contrastive learning
(CL) can extract the information hidden in data even without labels and has
shown some potential for imbalanced learning tasks. SCL further considers the
label information based on CL, which also addresses the insufficient data
augmentation techniques of tabular data. Therefore, in this work, we propose to
use SCL to learn a discriminative representation of imbalanced tabular data.
Additionally, the hyper-parameter temperature of SCL has a decisive influence
on the performance and is difficult to tune. We introduce TPE, a well-known
Bayesian optimization technique, to automatically select the best temperature.
Experiments are conducted on both binary and multi-class imbalanced tabular
datasets. As shown in the results obtained, TPE outperforms three other
hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) methods such as grid search, random search,
and genetic algorithm. More importantly, the proposed SCL-TPE method achieves

in fluid dynamics that have attracted much attention from scientists for both
the mathematical challenge and their industrial applications. The coupling of
electric fields and vorticity is of significant research interest. In this
paper, we study the flow structure of steady periodic travelling waves with
constant vorticity on a dielectric fluid under the effect of normal electric
fields. Through the conformal mapping technique combined with pseudo-spectral
numerical methods, we develop an approach that allows us to conclude that the
flow can have zero, two or three stagnation points according to variations in
the voltage potential. We describe in detail the recirculation zones that
emerge together with the stagnation points. Besides, we show that the number of
local maxima of the pressure on the bottom boundary is intrinsically connected
to the saddle points.

abundantly proven by the pathfinding Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA),
which has demonstrated a small subset of FASR's key capabilities such as
dynamically measuring the evolving magnetic field in eruptive flares, the
temporal and spatial evolution of the electron energy distribution in flares,
and the extensive coupling among dynamic components (flare, flux rope, current
sheet). The FASR concept, which is orders of magnitude more powerful than
EOVSA, is low-risk and extremely high reward, exploiting a fundamentally new
research domain in solar and space weather physics. Utilizing dynamic broadband
imaging spectropolarimetry at radio wavelengths, with its unique sensitivity to
coronal magnetic fields and to both thermal plasma and nonthermal electrons
from large flares to extremely weak transients, the ground-based FASR will make
synoptic measurements of the coronal magnetic field and map emissions from the
chromosphere to the middle corona in 3D. With its high spatial, spectral, and

Recognition (VidSitu) is framed as a task for structured prediction of multiple
events, their relationships, and actions and various verb-role pairs attached
to descriptive entities. This task poses several challenges in identifying,
disambiguating, and co-referencing entities across multiple verb-role pairs,
but also faces some challenges of evaluation. In this work, we propose the
addition of spatio-temporal grounding as an essential component of the
structured prediction task in a weakly supervised setting, and present a novel
three stage Transformer model, VideoWhisperer, that is empowered to make joint
predictions. In stage one, we learn contextualised embeddings for video
features in parallel with key objects that appear in the video clips to enable
fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning. The second stage sees verb-role queries
attend and pool information from object embeddings, localising answers to
questions posed about the action. The final stage generates these answers as
captions to describe each verb-role pair present in the video. Our model
operates on a group of events (clips) simultaneously and predicts verbs,
verb-role pairs, their nouns, and their grounding on-the-fly. When evaluated on
a grounding-augmented version of the VidSitu dataset, we observe a large
improvement in entity captioning accuracy, as well as the ability to localize
verb-roles without grounding annotations at training time.

social media channels. However, the social media strategy that brands should
employ during social activism is still unclear. We clarify the conditions under
which brands' social media strategies (i.e., specific response or lack thereof)
in the wake of social activism impact consumers' brand evaluations, as well as
effective social media responses that brands can use to engage in social
issues. Using a series of experiments conducted on various outcome variables
(e.g., brand attitudes, purchase intent, word-of-mouth, and social media
engagement), we find that brand relationship type (exchange, communal) affects
how consumers react to brands' social media strategies during social activism.
When brands' social media strategy is to not respond to social activism or to
utilize a low empathy response, consumers evaluate communal brands less
favorably than exchange brands. This difference in evaluations is attenuated
when brands utilize a high empathy response on social media to engage in social
activism conversations. We attribute these findings to differences in the
extent to which social media strategies of communal versus exchange brands are
perceived to comply with relationship norms during social activism. Our
findings contribute to the literature on firms' social media strategies for
engaging in social activism, brand relationships, and crisis communication. Our
research can help practitioners develop appropriate social media strategies in

find that words associated with hate speech targeting specific identities often

tasks as similar pretraining tasks on pretrained models by leveraging textual
prompts. Recent works have demonstrated that prompt learning is particularly
useful for few-shot learning, where there is limited training data. Depending
on the granularity of prompts, those methods can be roughly divided into
task-level prompting and instance-level prompting. Task-level prompting methods
learn one universal prompt for all input samples, which is efficient but
ineffective to capture subtle differences among different classes.
Instance-level prompting methods learn a specific prompt for each input, though
effective but inefficient. In this work, we develop a novel prototype-based
prompt learning method to overcome the above limitations. In particular, we
focus on few-shot image recognition tasks on pretrained vision-language models
(PVLMs) and develop a method of prompting through prototype (PTP), where we
define $K$ image prototypes and $K$ prompt prototypes. In PTP, the image
prototype represents a centroid of a certain image cluster in the latent space
and a prompt prototype is defined as a soft prompt in the continuous space. The
similarity between a query image and an image prototype determines how much
this prediction relies on the corresponding prompt prototype. Hence, in PTP,
similar images will utilize similar prompting ways. Through extensive
experiments on seven real-world benchmarks, we show that PTP is an effective
method to leverage the latent knowledge and adaptive to various PVLMs.
Moreover, through detailed analysis, we discuss pros and cons for prompt
learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning under the context of few-shot
learning.

binary expansion linear effect (BELIEF) for assessing and understanding
arbitrary relationships with a binary outcome. Models from the BELIEF framework
are easily interpretable because they describe the association of binary
variables in the language of linear models, yielding convenient theoretical
insight and striking parallels with the Gaussian world. In particular, an
algebraic structure on the predictors with nonzero slopes governs conditional
independence properties. With BELIEF, one may study generalized linear models
(GLM) through transparent linear models, providing insight into how modeling is
affected by the choice of link. For example, setting a GLM interaction
coefficient to zero does not necessarily lead to the kind of no-interaction
model assumption as understood under their linear model counterparts.
Furthermore, for a binary response, maximum likelihood estimation for GLMs
paradoxically fails under complete separation, when the data are most

different responses from risk-averse investors, with consequences for the
resource mix and market structure. We construct a stochastic equilibrium model
describing a competitive market with incomplete risk trading and compute
investment equilibria under different contracting regimes. Two policy
recommendations result. First, to avoid creating inefficiency by crowding out
other forms of risk sharing, system operators should allow resources contracted
through other means to opt out of mandatory capacity mechanisms, with their
contribution to those requirements subtracted from administratively defined
demand curves. Second, if they wish to promote a single contractual form,
regulators should consider replacing existing option-like capacity mechanisms
with a shaped forward contract for energy. Beyond these recommendations, we
discuss the tension that liberalized systems face in seeking to promote both
reliability and competitive outcomes.

used to build informative features for discrepancy estimation that helps the QA

Schwinger-Dyson methods. Since the predicted values of the dynamical electron
mass and chiral condensate at the physical fine structure constant are too
small to be measured, we simulate at a larger value $\alpha=1/5$. This requires
using electron masses as low as $m=0.001$ to extrapolate to $m=0$. At a large
magnetic field, the electrons occupy the lowest Landau level which has a small
profile in the plane orthogonal to the magnetic field, so that we are able to
use a lattice with small extent in these 2 directions. If chiral symmetry is
unbroken at $m=0$ the chiral condensate is dominated by large momenta and
should be insensitive to the lattice extent in the direction of the magnetic
field and the time direction. When chiral symmetry is broken at $m=0$, the
chiral condensate should be sensitive to the lattice size in these directions
as $m \rightarrow 0$. We search for this behaviour by increasing the lattice
extent in these 2 directions. Preliminary simulations show strong dependence of
the chiral condensate on the lattice extent in these 2 directions for the
smallest masses, and these increased condensates appear to be approaching a
non-zero limit as $m \rightarrow 0$.

However, attention mechanisms cannot scale to large $N$ due to their quadratic

batch-order invariance, which guarantees that the contributions of early image

this problem, we first propose a stochastic differential equation to model

we train a vision-based policy for planning wiping actions in simulation using

dovetail the RL policy with a whole-body trajectory optimization framework to

saturating actuators and multi-rate (asynchronous) aperiodic state measurements
is studied. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which measurements of the
plant states are collected at the controller end in a sporadic and asynchronous
fashion. A hybrid controller is used to perform a fusion of measurements
sampled at different times. In between sampling events, the controller behaves
as a copy of the plant and provides a feedback control signal based on the
reconstruction of the plant state. The presence of saturation at the plant
input limits the value of the components of this signal to a bounded range.
When a new measurement is available, the controller state undergoes an
instantaneous jump. The resulting system is augmented with a set of timers
triggering the arrival of new measurements and analyzed in a hybrid systems
framework. Relying on Lyapunov tools for hybrid systems and techniques for
control design under saturation, we propose sufficient conditions in the form
of matrix inequalities to ensure regional exponential stability of a closed-set
containing the origin of the plant, i.e., exponential stability with a
guaranteed region of attraction. Specifically, explicit estimates of the basin
of attraction are provided in the form of ellipsoidal sets. Leveraging those
conditions, a design procedure based on semidefinite programming is proposed to
design a stabilizing controller with maximized size of the basin attraction.
The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is shown in an example.

conditions. Furthermore, damping of libration, eccentricity, and fluctuations
in the semimajor axis are primarily dependent on the stiffness of the
secondary, whereas the semimajor axis secular expansion rate is dictated by the
stiffness of the primary, as expected. Systems experiencing stable planar
libration in the secondary can see a noticeable reduction in libration
amplitude after only a few years depending on the stiffness of the secondary,

performance improvements and the lifetime under orbital conditions was extended

thus enabled observations of much weaker sources.
  A leap forward in position resolution was achieved with the advent of

both principal types of 21 cm cosmology power spectrum estimation approaches

healthcare research for generating medical images to support open research and
augment medical datasets. Training generative adversarial neural networks
(GANs) usually require large amounts of training data. Federated learning (FL)
provides a way of training a central model using distributed data while keeping
raw data locally. However, given that the FL server cannot access the raw data,
it is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, an adversarial by poisoning training
data. Most backdoor attack strategies focus on classification models and
centralized domains. It is still an open question if the existing backdoor
attacks can affect GAN training and, if so, how to defend against the attack in
the FL setting. In this work, we investigate the overlooked issue of backdoor
attacks in federated GANs (FedGANs). The success of this attack is subsequently
determined to be the result of some local discriminators overfitting the
poisoned data and corrupting the local GAN equilibrium, which then further
contaminates other clients when averaging the generator's parameters and yields
high generator loss. Therefore, we proposed FedDetect, an efficient and
effective way of defending against the backdoor attack in the FL setting, which
allows the server to detect the client's adversarial behavior based on their
losses and block the malicious clients. Our extensive experiments on two
medical datasets with different modalities demonstrate the backdoor attack on
FedGANs can result in synthetic images with low fidelity. After detecting and
suppressing the detected malicious clients using the proposed defense strategy,
we show that FedGANs can synthesize high-quality medical datasets (with labels)
for data augmentation to improve classification models' performance.

By employing slender body theory and the Lorentz reciprocal theorem, we
determine particle trajectories for different geometric configurations and
arbitrary surface activities. Our analysis reveals that all particle
trajectories can be mathematically expressed through the equation for a circle.
The rotational speed of the particle dictates the frequency of the circular
motion and the ratio of translational and rotational speeds describes the
radius of the circular trajectory. We find that even for uniform surface
activity, geometric asymmetry is sufficient to induce a self-propelling motion.
Specifically, for uniform surface activity, we observe (i) when bent rod arm
lengths are equal, the particle only translates, (ii) when the length of one
arm is approximately four times the length of the other arm and the angle
between the arms is approximately {\pi}/2, the rotational and translational
speeds are at their maximum. We explain these trends by comparing the impact of
geometry on the hydrodynamic resistance tensor and the active driving force.
Overall, the results presented here quantify self-propulsion in
composite-slender bodies and motivate future research into self-propulsion of

tasks and how they should perform those tasks. To encode these, reward
functions, which specify the objective of a robot, are employed. However,
designing reward functions can be extremely challenging for complex tasks and
environments. A promising approach is to learn reward functions from humans.
Recently, several robot learning works embrace this approach and leverage human
demonstrations to learn the reward functions. Known as inverse reinforcement
learning, this approach relies on a fundamental assumption: humans can provide
near-optimal demonstrations to the robot. Unfortunately, this is rarely the
case: human demonstrations to the robot are often suboptimal due to various
reasons, e.g., difficulty of teleoperation, robot having high degrees of
freedom, or humans' cognitive limitations.
  This thesis is an attempt towards learning reward functions from human users
by using other, more reliable data modalities. Specifically, we study how
reward functions can be learned using comparative feedback, in which the human
user compares multiple robot trajectories instead of (or in addition to)
providing demonstrations. To this end, we first propose various forms of
comparative feedback, e.g., pairwise comparisons, best-of-many choices,
rankings, scaled comparisons; and describe how a robot can use these various
forms of human feedback to infer a reward function, which may be parametric or
non-parametric. Next, we propose active learning techniques to enable the robot
to ask for comparison feedback that optimizes for the expected information that
will be gained from that user feedback. Finally, we demonstrate the
applicability of our methods in a wide variety of domains, ranging from
autonomous driving simulations to home robotics, from standard reinforcement
learning benchmarks to lower-body exoskeletons.

  enrichment capacity of molecular docking models",,,,,"q-bio.QM stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The standard quantitative metric for evaluating enrichment capacity known as
$\textit{LogAUC}$ depends on a cutoff parameter that controls what the minimum
value of the log-scaled x-axis is. Unless this parameter is chosen carefully
for a given ROC curve, one of the two following problems occurs: either (1)
some fraction of the first inter-decoy intervals of the ROC curve are simply
thrown away and do not contribute to the metric at all, or (2) the very first
inter-decoy interval contributes too much to the metric at the expense of all
following inter-decoy intervals. We fix this problem with LogAUC by showing a
simple way to choose the cutoff parameter based on the number of decoys which
forces the first inter-decoy interval to always have a stable, sensible
contribution to the total value. Moreover, we introduce a normalized version of
LogAUC known as $\textit{enrichment score}$, which (1) enforces stability by
selecting the cutoff parameter in the manner described, (2) yields scores which
are more intuitively meaningful, and (3) allows reliably accurate comparison of
the enrichment capacities exhibited by different ROC curves, even those
produced using different numbers of decoys. Finally, we demonstrate the
advantage of enrichment score over unbalanced metrics using data from a real
retrospective docking study performed using the program $\textit{DOCK 3.7}$ on
the target receptor TRYB1 included in the $\textit{DUDE-Z}$ benchmark.

attention based models are expected to ground correct image regions with proper
generated words. However, for each time step in the decoding process, the
attention based models usually use the hidden state of the current input to
attend to the image regions. Under this setting, these attention models have a
""deviated focus"" problem that they calculate the attention weights based on
previous words instead of the one to be generated, impairing the performance of
both grounding and captioning. In this paper, we propose the Prophet Attention,
similar to the form of self-supervision. In the training stage, this module
utilizes the future information to calculate the ""ideal"" attention weights
towards image regions. These calculated ""ideal"" weights are further used to
regularize the ""deviated"" attention. In this manner, image regions are grounded
with the correct words. The proposed Prophet Attention can be easily
incorporated into existing image captioning models to improve their performance

Brillouin equation with refractive indices and phonon frequencies obtained from
the Becke line test and spectral peak positions, respectively. In general,
velocities increase with decreasing Fe content, approach those of muscovite at
low Fe concentrations. 12 of the 13 elastic constants for the full monoclinic
symmetry were obtained for each crystal by fitting analytic expressions for the
velocities as functions of propagation direction and elastic constants to
corresponding experimental data, with the remaining constant estimated using
hexagonal symmetry. Elastic constants C11, C22, and C66 are comparable to those
of muscovite and show little change with Fe concentration due to strong bonding
within layers. In contrast, nearly all remaining constants show a pronounced
dependence on Fe content, likely due to the weak interlayer bonding. Similar
behaviour is shown by elastic stability, which falls greatly as Fe
concentration increases, and elastic anisotropy within the basal cleavage
plane, which decreases with Fe content. This consistent dependency of all
measured elastic constants on Fe content suggests that biotite elasticity is a
function of octahedral site chemistry and gives a method to determine the
elastic constants and elastic stability of most biotite compositions provided,
Fe or Mg concentrations are known. Moreover, the good agreement between elastic
constants of Fe-poor biotite and those of phlogopite obtained from DFT

incorporated in a steady-state Smoluchowski equation that we solve numerically

partial and complete pinning of spheroidal orientation as the field strength is
increased and reveal remarkable and even counterintuitive noise-induced
phenomena (specifically due to translational particle diffusivity) deep into
the strong-field regime. These include field-induced defocusing, or lateral
broadening of the focused spheroidal layer, upon strengthening the field. We
map out focusing `phase' diagrams based on the field strength and tilt angle to
illustrate different regimes of behavior including centered focusing and
defocusing in transverse field, and off-centered focusing in tilted fields. The
latter encompasses two subregimes of optimal and shouldered focusing where
spheroidal density profiles across the channel width display either an isolated

times, addressability, and gate fidelities. Unfortunately, these devices are
restricted by the number of on-chip qubits, capping processing power and
slowing progress toward fault-tolerance. Although emerging transmon devices
feature over 100 qubits, building QCs large enough for meaningful
demonstrations of quantum advantage requires overcoming many design challenges.
For example, today's transmon qubits suffer from significant variation due to
limited precision in fabrication. As a result, barring significant improvements
in current fabrication techniques, scaling QCs by building ever larger
individual chips with more qubits is hampered by device variation. Severe
device variation that degrades QC performance is referred to as a defect. Here,
we focus on a specific defect known as a frequency collision.
  When transmon frequencies collide, their difference falls within a range that
limits two-qubit gate fidelity. Frequency collisions occur with greater
probability on larger QCs, causing collision-free yields to decline as the
number of on-chip qubits increases. As a solution, we propose exploiting the
higher yields associated with smaller QCs by integrating quantum chiplets
within quantum multi-chip modules (MCMs). Yield, gate performance, and
application-based analysis show the feasibility of QC scaling through

based configurable FPGA design that is targeted for edge devices and supports
three feature attribution algorithms. Tile based computation is employed to
maximally use on-chip resources while adhering to the resource constraints.
Representative CNNs are trained on CIFAR-10 dataset and implemented on multiple
Xilinx FPGAs using 16-bit fixed-point precision demonstrating flexibility of
our library. Finally, through efficient reuse of allocated hardware resources,
our design methodology demonstrates a pathway to repurpose inference
accelerators to support feature attribution with minimal overhead, thereby
enabling real-time XAI on the edge.

Y\to \mathbb R$ be separately continuous. The following conditions are
equivalent: (1) there is a dense $G_\delta$ subset of $D\subset Y$ so that
$\Phi$ is continuous at every point of $X\times D$ (Namioka property); (2)
$\Phi$ is quasicontinuous; (3) $\Phi$ extends to a separately continuous
function on $\beta X\times \beta Y$. This theorem makes it possible to combine
studies of the Namioka property and generalizations of the
Eberlein-Grothendieck theorem on the precompactness of subsets of function
spaces. We also obtain a characterization of separately continuous functions on
the product of several pseudocompact spaces extending to separately continuous
functions on products of Stone-Cech extensions of spaces. These results are
used to study groups and Mal'tsev spaces with separately continuous operations.

(HMT) in the single-nucleon momentum distribution function
$n_{\v{k}}^J(\rho,\delta)$ in cold neutron-rich matter. While there are clear
experimental evidences that the SRC/HMT effects are different for neutrons and
protons and their strengths depend strongly on the isospin asymmetry of finite
nuclei mostly based on electron-nucleus scattering experiments, much less is
known experimentally about the SRC/HMT effects in the dense neutron-rich
matter. To facilitate further explorations of SRC/HMT effects in dense
neutron-rich matter especially with heavy-ion reactions involving high-energy
radioactive beams as well as multimessenger observations of neutron stars and
their mergers, by incorporating the SRC-induced HMT in
$n_{\v{k}}^J(\rho,\delta)$ into a Gogny-like energy density functional we study
SRC/HMT effects on the equation of state (EOS) especially its symmetry energy
term and single-nucleon potential in the dense asymmetric nucleonic matter
(ANM). Using a parametrization as a surrogate for the momentum-dependent kernel
in the Gogny-like energy density functional (EDF) we derive analytical
expressions for all components of the ANM EOS and their characteristics (e.g.,
magnitude, slope and curvature as well as nucleon effective mass) at saturation
density $\rho_0$ as well as the momentum-dependent single-nucleon optical
potential in neutron-rich matter using parameters characterizing nuclear
interactions as well as the size, shape and isospin dependence of the HMT at
$\rho_0$. Some consequences of the SRC/HMT effects on properties of neutron
stars are also studied.

Classifiers that are aware of this hierarchy may be able to make confident
predictions at a coarse level despite being uncertain at the fine-grained
level. While it is generally possible to vary the granularity of predictions
using a threshold at inference time, most contemporary work considers only
leaf-node prediction, and almost no prior work has compared methods at multiple
operating points. We present an efficient algorithm to produce operating
characteristic curves for any method that assigns a score to every class in the
hierarchy. Applying this technique to evaluate existing methods reveals that
top-down classifiers are dominated by a naive flat softmax classifier across
the entire operating range. We further propose two novel loss functions and
show that a soft variant of the structured hinge loss is able to significantly
outperform the flat baseline. Finally, we investigate the poor accuracy of
top-down classifiers and demonstrate that they perform relatively well on

  Fatality and Survival Rates (2007-2018)","18 pages including bibliography, 13 figures",,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Introduction: The goal of this paper is to study inequities in breast cancer
(BC) health care outcomes for Chilean women, including case fatality (FR) and
survival rates (SR), stratified by type of health care provider and
geographical area. A secondary goal is to estimate BC incidence (IR) and
mortality (MR) rates by health care providers and region. Methods: We used two
public anonymized databases provided by the Ministry of Health: the national
death and hospital discharges datasets. For survival analysis, we used the
Kaplan Meier product-limit estimator (KM) with a 95% ci and the Cox
proportional hazards model (CM) with null-hypothesis significance testing of
p>0.001. Results: We considered a cohort of 58,254 and 16,615 BC hospital
discharges and deaths for the period 2007-2018. New cases and deaths due to BC
increased by 43.6% and 33.6% respectively. Avg age-adjusted IR and MR were 44.0
and 10.5, respectively. Women affiliated to a private provider (ISAPRE) have an
avg age adjusted IR of 60.6 compared to 38.8 for women affiliated with the
public provider (FONASA). The national FR has remained constant over time, with
a mean of 26.8. Women affiliated with ISAPRE had a considerably lower FR during
the period under study, with an avg of 15.7 compared to 27.5 for women in
FONASA. The avg 5-year SR were 0.81 and 0.90 for FONASA and ISAPRE. Women from
the Metropolitan area have higher SRs than women from other regions. SRs
obtained using the CM have a similar behavior to those obtained by the KM.
Discussion: Despite the inclusion of BC in the GES plan in 2005 to provide
greater, there are still significant differences in FR and SR for patients
affiliated to ISAPRE compared to those in FONASA, a choice that is directly
associated with socioeconomic level, and for patients in the Metropolitan and
other regions. Further studies are required to determine the causes of these
disparities.

oscillations associated with magnetar giant flares and short bursts. We present
the results of a search for short-duration (milliseconds to seconds) and
long-duration ($\sim$ 100 s) transient gravitational waves from 13 magnetar
short bursts observed during Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA's third
observation run. These 13 bursts come from two magnetars, SGR 1935$+$2154 and
Swift J1818.0$-$1607. We also include three other electromagnetic burst events
detected by Fermi GBM which were identified as likely coming from one or more
magnetars, but they have no association with a known magnetar. No magnetar
giant flares were detected during the analysis period. We find no evidence of
gravitational waves associated with any of these 16 bursts. We place upper
bounds on the root-sum-square of the integrated gravitational-wave strain that
reach $2.2 \times 10^{-23}$ $/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at 100 Hz for the
short-duration search and $8.7 \times 10^{-23}$ $/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at $450$ Hz
for the long-duration search, given a detection efficiency of 50%. For a
ringdown signal at 1590 Hz targeted by the short-duration search the limit is
set to $1.8 \times 10^{-22}$ $/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. Using the estimated distance
to each magnetar, we derive upper bounds on the emitted gravitational-wave
energy of $3.2 \times 10^{43}$ erg ($7.3 \times 10^{43}$ erg) for SGR
1935$+$2154 and $8.2 \times 10^{42}$ erg ($2.8 \times 10^{43}$ erg) for Swift
J1818.0$-$1607, for the short-duration (long-duration) search. Assuming
isotropic emission of electromagnetic radiation of the burst fluences, we
constrain the ratio of gravitational-wave energy to electromagnetic energy for
bursts from SGR 1935$+$2154 with available fluence information. The lowest of
these ratios is $3 \times 10^3$.

for a race car capable of achieving competitive driving performance in the
different disciplines of the Formula Student Driverless. By using a 360{\deg}
LiDAR and optionally three cameras, we reliably recognize the plastic cones
that mark the track boundaries at distances of around 35 m, enabling us to
drive at the physical limits of the car. Using a GraphSLAM algorithm, we are
able to map these cones with a root-mean-square error of less than 15 cm while
driving at speeds of over 70 kph on a narrow track. The high-precision map is
used in the trajectory planning to detect the lane boundaries using Delaunay
triangulation and a parametric cubic spline. We calculate an optimized
trajectory using a minimum curvature approach together with a GGS-diagram that
takes the aerodynamics at different velocities into account. To track the
target path with accelerations of up to 1.6 g, the control system is split into
a PI controller for longitudinal control and model predictive controller for
lateral control. Additionally, a low-level optimal control allocation is used.
The software is realized in ROS C++ and tested in a custom simulation, as well
as on the actual race track.

parameterizing various sorts of these quotients, and the corresponding

recursively compressed algebras of permissible socle type is proved to be
covered by open subschemes, each one isomorphic to an open subscheme of a
certain affine space. Moreover, the polynomial variables are weighted, the
polynomial ring is replaced by a graded module, and attention is paid to

bath in the presence of an external periodic potential in one dimension. When
we coarse-grain, i.e., bin the particle positions using bin sizes that are
larger than the periodicity of the potential, the packet of spreading
particles, all starting from a common origin, converges to a normal
distribution centered at the origin with a mean-squared displacement that grows
as $2 D^* t$, with an effective diffusion constant that is smaller than that of
a freely diffusing particle. We examine the interplay between this
coarse-grained description and the fine structure of the density, which is
given by the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) factor $e^{-V(x)/k_B T}$, the latter being
non-normalizable. We explain this result and construct a theory of observables
using the Fokker-Planck equation. These observables are classified as those
that are related to the BG fine structure, like the energy or occupation times,
while others, like the positional moments, for long times, converge to those of
the large-scale description. Entropy falls into a special category as it has a
coarse-grained and a fine structure description. The basic thermodynamic
formula $F=TS - E$ is extended to this far-from-equilibrium system. The ergodic
properties are also studied using tools from infinite ergodic theory.

  using Historical Information","To appear in IEEE S&P 2023",,,,"cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning attacks in which malicious
clients poison the global model via sending malicious model updates to the
server. Existing defenses focus on preventing a small number of malicious
clients from poisoning the global model via robust federated learning methods
and detecting malicious clients when there are a large number of them. However,
it is still an open challenge how to recover the global model from poisoning
attacks after the malicious clients are detected. A naive solution is to remove
the detected malicious clients and train a new global model from scratch, which
incurs large cost that may be intolerable for resource-constrained clients such
as smartphones and IoT devices.
  In this work, we propose FedRecover, which can recover an accurate global
model from poisoning attacks with small cost for the clients. Our key idea is
that the server estimates the clients' model updates instead of asking the
clients to compute and communicate them during the recovery process. In
particular, the server stores the global models and clients' model updates in
each round, when training the poisoned global model. During the recovery
process, the server estimates a client's model update in each round using its
stored historical information. Moreover, we further optimize FedRecover to
recover a more accurate global model using warm-up, periodic correction,
abnormality fixing, and final tuning strategies, in which the server asks the
clients to compute and communicate their exact model updates. Theoretically, we
show that the global model recovered by FedRecover is close to or the same as
that recovered by train-from-scratch under some assumptions. Empirically, our
evaluation on four datasets, three federated learning methods, as well as
untargeted and targeted poisoning attacks (e.g., backdoor attacks) shows that
FedRecover is both accurate and efficient.

AO capabilities. The AIROPA project aims to model these PSF variations for the
NIRC2 imager at the Keck Observatory. Here, we present the characterization of
the instrumental phase aberrations over the entire NIRC2 field of view and we
present a new metric for quantifying the quality of the calibration, the
fraction of variance unexplained (FVU). We used phase diversity measurements
obtained on an artificial light source to characterize the variation of the
aberrations across the field of view and their evolution with time. We find
that there is a daily variation of the wavefront error (RMS of the residuals is
94~nm) common to the whole detector, but the differential aberrations across
the field of view are very stable (RMS of the residuals between different
epochs is 59~nm). This means that instrumental calibrations need to be
monitored often only at the center of the detector, and the much more
time-consuming variations across the field of view can be characterized less
frequently (most likely when hardware upgrades happen). Furthermore, we tested
AIROPA's instrumental model through real data of the fiber images on the
detector. We find that modeling the PSF variations across the field of view
improves the FVU metric by 60\% and reduces the detection of fake sources by
70\%.

carefully study decentralized learning with unlabeled data through the lens of
self-supervised learning (SSL), specifically contrastive visual representation
learning. We study the effectiveness of a range of contrastive learning
algorithms under decentralized learning settings, on relatively large-scale
datasets including ImageNet-100, MS-COCO, and a new real-world robotic
warehouse dataset. Our experiments show that the decentralized SSL (Dec-SSL)
approach is robust to the heterogeneity of decentralized datasets, and learns
useful representation for object classification, detection, and segmentation
tasks. This robustness makes it possible to significantly reduce communication
and reduce the participation ratio of data sources with only minimal drops in
performance. Interestingly, using the same amount of data, the representation
learned by Dec-SSL can not only perform on par with that learned by centralized
SSL which requires communication and excessive data storage costs, but also
sometimes outperform representations extracted from decentralized SL which
requires extra knowledge about the data labels. Finally, we provide theoretical
insights into understanding why data heterogeneity is less of a concern for
Dec-SSL objectives, and introduce feature alignment and clustering techniques
to develop a new Dec-SSL algorithm that further improves the performance, in

sparsity-based shrinkage to obviate the linear factorization and null

multidimensional IRT models, so that item partitioning is consistent with the
ultimate nonlinear factor model. We also analogize our multidimensional IRT
model to probabilistic autoencoders, specifying an encoder function that
amortizes the inference of ability parameters from item responses. The encoder
function is equivalent to the ""VBE"" step in a stochastic variational Bayesian

sparse masks. Conventional approaches alternate between: labeling pseudo-masks
and optimizing network parameters. However, such iterative two-stage paradigm
is unwieldy and could be trapped in poor local optima since the networks
undesirably regress to the erroneous pseudo-masks. To address these issues, we
propose a non-iterative method where a stream of varying (pacing) pseudo-masks
teach a network via consistency training, named PacingPseudo. Our motivation
lies first in a non-iterative process. Interestingly, it can be achieved
gracefully by a siamese architecture, wherein a stream of pseudo-masks
naturally assimilate a stream of predicted masks during training. Second, we
make the consistency training effective with two necessary designs: (i) entropy
regularization to obtain high-confidence pseudo-masks for effective teaching;
and (ii) distorted augmentations to create discrepancy between the pseudo-mask
and predicted-mask streams for consistency regularization. Third, we devise a
new memory bank mechanism that provides an extra source of ensemble features to
complement scarce labeled pixels. The efficacy of the proposed PacingPseudo is
validated on three public medical image datasets, including the segmentation
tasks of abdominal multi-organs, cardiac structures, and myocardium. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our PacingPseudo improves the baseline by large margins
and consistently outcompetes several previous methods. In some cases, our
PacingPseudo achieves comparable performance with its fully-supervised
counterparts, showing the feasibility of our method for the challenging
scribble-supervised segmentation applications. The code and scribble

federated recommendations (FedRecs) attract more and more attention. Existing
FedRecs mainly focus on how to effectively and securely learn personal
interests and preferences from their on-device interaction data. Still, none of
them considers how to efficiently erase a user's contribution to the federated
training process. We argue that such a dual setting is necessary. First, from
the privacy protection perspective, ``the right to be forgotten'' requires that
users have the right to withdraw their data contributions. Without the
reversible ability, FedRecs risk breaking data protection regulations. On the
other hand, enabling a FedRec to forget specific users can improve its
robustness and resistance to malicious clients' attacks. To support user
unlearning in FedRecs, we propose an efficient unlearning method FRU (Federated
Recommendation Unlearning), inspired by the log-based rollback mechanism of
transactions in database management systems. It removes a user's contribution
by rolling back and calibrating the historical parameter updates and then uses
these updates to speed up federated recommender reconstruction. However,
storing all historical parameter updates on resource-constrained personal
devices is challenging and even infeasible. In light of this challenge, we
propose a small-sized negative sampling method to reduce the number of item
embedding updates and an importance-based update selection mechanism to store
only important model updates. To evaluate the effectiveness of FRU, we propose
an attack method to disturb FedRecs via a group of compromised users and use
FRU to recover recommenders by eliminating these users' influence. Finally, we
conduct experiments on two real-world recommendation datasets with two widely

the minimum amount of WDA tasks performed among all clusters by optimizing the

design is critical for interference management in multi-cluster AirComp

interference between each UAV and its nonassociated clusters. Although it is
generally challenging to optimally solve the formulated non-convex

compromise approach is developed by exploiting bisection and block coordinate
descent methods, yielding an optimal transceiver solution in each iteration.
The optimal binary variables and a suboptimal trajectory are obtained by using
the dual method and successive convex approximation, respectively. Simulations
show the considerable performance gains of the proposed design over benchmarks

implement a novel structure with two independent encoders and a self-attention

good robustness of the model.

challenging one due to its noise, speckle and artifacts. Edge-map of BUS images
also does not help because in most cases the edge-map gives no information
whatsoever. Almost all segmentation technique takes the edge-map of the image
as its first step, though there are a few algorithms that try to avoid
edge-maps as well. Improving the edge-map of breast ultrasound images
theoretically improves the chances of automatic segmentation to be more
precise. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic technique of histogram
splitting using two pointers. Here the user only has to select two initially
guessed points denoting a circle on the region of interest (ROI). The method
will automatically study the internal histogram and split it using two
pointers. The output BUS image has improved edge-map and ultimately the
segmentation on it is better compared to regular segmentation using same
algorithm and same initialization. Also, we further processed the edge-map to
have less edge-pixels to area ratio, improving the homogeneity and the chances
of easy segmentation in the future.

  accretion flow around a black hole","Accepted to PASJ",,"10.1093/pasj/psac081",,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study ejection mechanisms for two kinds of steady jets: one observed from
black hole binaries in the low/hard state and the other from SS433. The
specific energy of the ejected gas is required to be positive for the jets to
get to infinity, while that of the accreted gas is naively considered to be
negative at the outermost boundary of the accretion flow. To reconcile the
opposite sign of the specific energies, we propose a situation where two layers
exist in the accretion flow and one layer receives energy from the other
sufficiently for the specific energy to be positive. For the steady jets in the
low/hard state, the accretion ring at the outermost end of the accretion flow
is considered to yield two-layer flow in which a geometrically thick ADAF
sandwiches a geometrically thin accretion disk and the thin disk is supposed to
turn to another ADAF on the inner side. The energy transfer is expected to
occur through turbulent mixing between the two layers and the upper layer is
discussed to have the positive specific energy large enough for the terminal
velocity to be $\sim$ 0.1 $c$. For the steady jets from SS433, a slim disk is
argued to separate into two stratified layers due to the photon diffusion in
the direction perpendicular to the equatorial plane under the advection
dominated situation. In this case, the specific energy of the upper layer is
expected to be positive such that the terminal velocity exceeds 0.2 $c$. The
jet ejection process near the black hole is investigated commonly to both the
two-layer cases and predicts the jet opening angle becomes as small as
2$^{\circ}$.

fascinating features with many applications. Here we report the observations of
mode-locked platicon frequency microcomb formation in normal dispersion
dispersion-managed microresonators operating at microwave K-band repetition
rate for the first time. Facilitated by the thermally controllable modulated
background induced by avoided mode-crossings, various platicon bound state
patterns with regular and irregular temporal separation are stably generated
due to an additional balance between repulsive and attractive forces resulting
from non-trivial interpulse and background electromagnetic field interactions.
The number of mode-locked pulses can be switched by forward- and
backward-cavity pump detuning and, with increasing pump power, result in
stationary bound-state complexes. These experimental observations are in
accordance with our nonlinear numerical simulations that includes avoided
mode-crossing, anomalous fourth-order dispersion and quality-factor spectral
filtering. The observed platicon mode-locked pulses have broad spectral
profiles overlapping Kelly-sideband-like parametric oscillation. The
single-sideband phase noise of microcomb repetition rate is characterized for
the different mode-locked states, comparable with electronic microwave
oscillators. The ability to achieve mode-locking in dispersion-managed
microresonators provides a platform to reduce pulse timing jitter and enrich
the exploration of ultrafast phenomena in microresonators.

of the tumor microenvironment in colon tissue. Traditional methods are still

model for handling nuclei based on the UNet framework, called MGTUNet, which
uses Mish, Group normalization and transposed convolution layer to improve the
segmentation model, and a ranger optimizer to adjust the SmoothL1Loss values.
Secondly, it uses different channels to segment and classify different types of
nucleus, ultimately completing the nuclei instance segmentation and
classification task, and the nuclei component regression task simultaneously.
Finally, we did extensive comparison experiments using eight segmentation

the models, MGTUNet obtained 0.6254 on PQ, 0.6359 on mPQ, and 0.8695 on R2.
Thus, the experiments demonstrated that MGTUNet is now a state-of-the-art

strongly-correlated magnetism with unconventional superconductivity. While
comparisons with the superconducting cuprates are natural, very little is known
about the metallic state of the nickelates, making these comparisons difficult.
We probe the electronic dispersion of thin-film superconducting 5-layer ($n=5$)
and metallic 3-layer ($n=3$) nickelates by measuring the Seebeck coefficient,
$S$. We find a temperature independent and negative $S/T$ for both the $n=5$
nickelate, with strange metal resistivity, and the $n=3$ compound, with more
conventional Fermi liquid resistivity. These results are in stark contrast with
the strongly temperature-dependent $S/T$ measured at similar electron filling
in the cuprate La$_{1.36}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.24}$CuO$_4$. We reproduce the
temperature dependence, sign, and amplitude of $S/T$ in the nickelates using
Boltzmann transport theory combined with the electronic structure calculated
from density functional theory. This demonstrates that the electronic structure
obtained from first-principles calculations is a good starting point for
calculating the transport properties of superconducting nickelates, and
suggests that, despite indications of strong electronic correlations, there are
well-defined quasiparticles in the metallic state of this family of materials.
Finally, we explain the differences in the Seebeck coefficient between
nickelates and cuprates as originating in strong dissimilarities in impurity
concentrations. Beyond establishing a baseline understanding of how the
electronic structure relates to transport coefficients in these new materials,
this work demonstrates the power of the semi-classical approach to
quantitatively describe transport measurements, even in the strange-metallic

well-characterized stability of their mode structure. However, measurements of
several etalon systems across bandwidths greater than $500$ nm indicate that
the modes exhibit complex, wavelength-dependent drift. Surprisingly, modes in
different regions of the spectrum were found to drift in different directions,
implying that the optical length of the etalon is getting both longer and
shorter at the same time. In this paper, we provide a solution to this puzzling
observation. With Fresnel analysis and the transfer matrix method, we model the
reflective phase of the multi-layer dielectric mirrors in the etalon used as a
calibrator for the Habitable Zone Planet Finder (HPF). We use this phase to
calculate the etalon mode positions and are able to reproduce the observed
oscillatory chromatic drift of the etalon's mode spectrum across 800-1300 nm.
Despite the complexity of the mirror structure, our modeling indicates that the
gradual relaxation of the outermost layers of the etalon mirrors is the
dominant source of the observed behavior. We also model the effect of
temperature, incident angle alignment variations, and manufacturing tolerances,
and show that they are likely not causes of the chromatic mode frequency
shifts. Our work highlights techniques that can be employed in the design of
broad bandwidth mirrors for future etalons to make them more useful for the

corrects spelling errors in Chinese texts. As most of these spelling errors are
caused by phonetic similarity, effectively modeling the pronunciation of
Chinese characters is a key factor for CSC. In this paper, we consider
introducing an auxiliary task of Chinese pronunciation prediction (CPP) to
improve CSC, and, for the first time, systematically discuss the adaptivity and
granularity of this auxiliary task. We propose SCOPE which builds on top of a
shared encoder two parallel decoders, one for the primary CSC task and the
other for a fine-grained auxiliary CPP task, with a novel adaptive weighting
scheme to balance the two tasks. In addition, we design a delicate iterative
correction strategy for further improvements during inference. Empirical
evaluation shows that SCOPE achieves new state-of-the-art on three CSC
benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of the auxiliary
CPP task. Comprehensive ablation studies further verify the positive effects of
adaptivity and granularity of the task. Code and data used in this paper are

consumers. As researchers develop tools for statically or dynamically detecting
suspicious apps, malware writers regularly update their attack mechanisms to
hide malicious behavior implementation. This poses two problems to current
research techniques: static analysis approaches, given their
over-approximations, can report an overwhelming number of false alarms, while
dynamic approaches will miss those behaviors that are hidden through evasion
techniques. We propose in this work a static approach specifically targeted at
highlighting hidden sensitive operations, mainly sensitive data flows. The
prototype version of HiSenDroid has been evaluated on a large-scale dataset of
thousands of malware and goodware samples on which it successfully revealed
anti-analysis code snippets aiming at evading detection by dynamic analysis. We
further experimentally show that, with FlowDroid, some of the hidden sensitive
behaviors would eventually lead to private data leaks. Those leaks would have
been hard to spot either manually among the large number of false positives
reported by the state of the art static analyzers, or by dynamic tools.
Overall, by putting the light on hidden sensitive operations, HiSenDroid helps
security analysts in validating potential sensitive data operations, which
would be previously unnoticed.

on deep learning rely on a large number of manually labeled data, and labeling
these data costs a lot of time and energy. Therefore, we develop a object

thighbone fracture localization. In this work, we build a semi-supervised
object detection(SSOD) framework based on single-stage detector, which
including three modules: adaptive difficult sample oriented (ADSO) module,
Fusion Box and deformable expand encoder (Dex encoder). ADSO module takes the
classification score as the label reliability evaluation criterion by

box for box regression and Dex encoder is proposed to enhance the adaptability
of image augmentation. The experiment is conducted on the thighbone fracture
dataset, which includes 3484 training thigh fracture images and 358 testing
thigh fracture images. The experimental results show that the proposed method
achieves the state-of-the-art AP in thighbone fracture detection at different
labeled data rates, i.e. 1%, 5% and 10%. Besides, we use full data to achieve
knowledge distillation, our method achieves 86.2% AP50 and 52.6% AP75.

introducing a principled task phasing approach that uses demonstrations to
automatically generate a curriculum sequence. Using inverse RL from
(suboptimal) demonstrations we define a simple initial task. Our task phasing
approach then provides a framework to gradually increase the complexity of the
task all the way to the target task, while retuning the RL agent in each
phasing iteration. Two approaches for phasing are considered: (1) gradually
increasing the proportion of time steps an RL agent is in control, and (2)
phasing out a guiding informative reward function. We present conditions that
guarantee the convergence of these approaches to an optimal policy.
Experimental results on 3 sparse reward domains demonstrate that our task

semantic attributes to learn a more generalized version of the visual concept
from very few examples. However, it is a known fact that human visual learning
benefits immensely from inputs from multiple modalities such as vision,
language, and audio. Inspired by the human learning nature of encapsulating the
existing knowledge of a visual category which is in the form of language, we
introduce a contrastive alignment mechanism for visual and semantic feature
vectors to learn much more generalized visual concepts for few-shot learning.
Our method simply adds an auxiliary contrastive learning objective which
captures the contextual knowledge of a visual category from a strong textual
encoder in addition to the existing training mechanism. Hence, the approach is
more generalized and can be plugged into any existing FSL method. The
pre-trained semantic feature extractor (learned from a large-scale text
corpora) we use in our approach provides a strong contextual prior knowledge to
assist FSL. The experimental results done in popular FSL datasets show that our
approach is generic in nature and provides a strong boost to the existing FSL

estimation of unit-specific treatment effects from panel data collected via a
dynamic treatment regime and in the presence of unobserved confounding. That
is, each unit receives multiple treatments sequentially, based on an adaptive
policy, which depends on a latent endogenously time-varying confounding state
of the treated unit. Under a low-rank latent factor model assumption and a
technical overlap assumption we propose an identification strategy for any
unit-specific mean outcome under any sequence of interventions. The latent
factor model we propose admits linear time-varying and time-invariant dynamical
systems as special cases. Our approach can be seen as an identification
strategy for structural nested mean models under a low-rank latent factor
assumption on the blip effects. Our method, which we term ""synthetic blip
effects"", is a backwards induction process, where the blip effect of a
treatment at each period and for a target unit is recursively expressed as
linear combinations of blip effects of a carefully chosen group of other units
that received the designated treatment. Our work avoids the combinatorial
explosion in the number of units that would be required by a vanilla
application of prior synthetic control and synthetic intervention methods in

asymmetric pair production that genuinely distinguishes it from the usual
leptoquark pair production is given by the fact that the two leptoquarks that

are not charge conjugates of each other. Hence the proposed name of asymmetric
leptoquark pair production for this type of process. We spell out prerequisite
conditions for the asymmetric leptoquark pair production mechanism to be
operational and enumerate all possible combinations of leptoquark multiplets
that can potentially generate it. We finally reinterpret existing leptoquark
pair production search results within several simple scalar leptoquark
extensions of the Standard Model, assuming that the leptoquarks exclusively

similarities between the source and target cases, has played an essential role
in intelligent legal systems. Semantic text matching models have been applied
to the task where the source and target legal cases are considered as long-form
text documents. These general-purpose matching models make the predictions
solely based on the texts in the legal cases, overlooking the essential role of
the law articles in legal case matching. In the real world, the matching
results (e.g., relevance labels) are dramatically affected by the law articles
because the contents and the judgments of a legal case are radically formed on
the basis of law. From the causal sense, a matching decision is affected by the
mediation effect from the cited law articles by the legal cases, and the direct
effect of the key circumstances (e.g., detailed fact descriptions) in the legal
cases. In light of the observation, this paper proposes a model-agnostic causal
learning framework called Law-Match, under which the legal case matching models
are learned by respecting the corresponding law articles. Given a pair of legal
cases and the related law articles, Law-Match considers the embeddings of the
law articles as instrumental variables (IVs), and the embeddings of legal cases
as treatments. Using IV regression, the treatments can be decomposed into
law-related and law-unrelated parts, respectively reflecting the mediation and
direct effects. These two parts are then combined with different weights to
collectively support the final matching prediction. We show that the framework
is model-agnostic, and a number of legal case matching models can be applied as
the underlying models. Comprehensive experiments show that Law-Match can
outperform state-of-the-art baselines on three public datasets.

of exposure data is limited to a subset of the cohort, leading to a large
proportion of missing data by design. Standard analysis uses inverse
probability weighting (IPW) to address this intended missing data, but little
research has been conducted into how best to perform analysis when there is
also unintended missingness. Multiple imputation (MI) has become a default
standard for handling unintended missingness, but when used in combination with
IPW, the imputation model needs to take account of the weighting to ensure
compatibility with the analysis model. Alternatively, MI could be used to
handle both the intended and unintended missingness. While the performance of a
solely MI approach has been investigated in the context of a case-cohort study
with a time-to-event outcome, it is unclear how this approach performs with
binary outcomes. We conducted a simulation study to assess and compare the
performance of approaches using only MI, only IPW, and a combination of MI and
IPW, for handling intended and unintended missingness in this setting. We also
applied the approaches to a case study. Our results show that the combined
approach is approximately unbiased for estimation of the exposure effect when
the sample size is large, and was the least biased with small sample sizes,
while MI-only or IPW-only exhibited larger biases in both sample size settings.
These findings suggest that MI is the preferred approach to handle intended and

injective modules relative to $\mathcal{A}$. We also find several hereditary

incomplete inputs. This hardening and target-enhancing help the new model
surpass the base model, since they enforce additional patch relation modeling

applications, it is also desirable that the common subgraph be connected, i.e.,
the maximum common connected subgraph (MCCS). Finding exact MCES and MCCS is
intractable, but may be unnecessary if ranking corpus graphs by relevance is
the goal. We design fast and trainable neural functions that approximate MCES

query and corpus graph separately, and compare these representations using
simple similarity functions at the last stage, leading to highly scalable
systems. Early interaction methods combine information from both graphs right

propose both late and early interaction neural MCES and MCCS formulations. They

variables from observations made with measurement error. We consider a specific
formulation of the problem, where the unobserved target variables follow a
linear non-Gaussian acyclic model, and the measurement process follows the
random measurement error model. Existing methods on this formulation rely on
non-scalable over-complete independent component analysis (OICA). In this work,
we propose the Transformed Independent Noise (TIN) condition, which checks for
independence between a specific linear transformation of some measured
variables and certain other measured variables. By leveraging the
non-Gaussianity and higher-order statistics of data, TIN is informative about
the graph structure among the unobserved target variables. By utilizing TIN,
the ordered group decomposition of the causal model is identifiable. In other
words, we could achieve what once required OICA to achieve by only conducting
independence tests. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data

statistically different inclination angles. The low-intensity tail has an
inclination angle $\approx55^\circ$ on average, while that of the central dense

loss of any accuracy of final regularized solutions as long as the noise level

updating iterative solutions can be performed using single precision without
sacrificing any accuracy. The results indicate that the most time consuming
parts of the algorithm can be implemented using single precision, and thus the
performance of LSQR for solving discrete linear ill-posed problems can be
significantly enhanced. Numerical experiments are made for testing the single

learning submodular set functions under distant supervision in the form of

instances from a multi-label untrimmed video. Multi-label TAD is more
challenging as it requires for fine-grained class discrimination within a
single video and precise localization of the co-occurring instances. To
mitigate this issue, we extend the sparse query-based detection paradigm from
the traditional TAD and propose the multi-label TAD framework of PointTAD.
Specifically, our PointTAD introduces a small set of learnable query points to
represent the important frames of each action instance. This point-based
representation provides a flexible mechanism to localize the discriminative
frames at boundaries and as well the important frames inside the action.
Moreover, we perform the action decoding process with the Multi-level
Interactive Module to capture both point-level and instance-level action
semantics. Finally, our PointTAD employs an end-to-end trainable framework
simply based on RGB input for easy deployment. We evaluate our proposed method
on two popular benchmarks and introduce the new metric of detection-mAP for
multi-label TAD. Our model outperforms all previous methods by a large margin
under the detection-mAP metric, and also achieves promising results under the
segmentation-mAP metric. Code is available at

study two probability measures on the space of all Zeckendorf games on input

the rate of spin transfer to the magnetization becomes slower than the rate of

networked bivirus epidemic model (termed the bivirus model for short), in which
two competing viruses spread through a set of populations (nodes) connected by
two graphs, which may be different if the two viruses have different
transmission pathways. The networked dynamics can give rise to complex
equilibria patterns, and most current results identify conditions on the model
parameters for convergence to the healthy equilibrium (where both viruses are
extinct) or a boundary equilibrium (where one virus is endemic and the other is
extinct). However, there are only limited results on coexistence equilibria
(where both viruses are endemic). This paper establishes a set of ``counting''
results which provide lower bounds on the number of coexistence equilibria, and
perhaps more importantly, establish properties on the local
stability/instability properties of these equilibria. In order to do this, we
employ the Poincar\'e-Hopf Theorem but with significant modifications to
overcome several challenges arising from the bivirus system model, such as the
fact that the system dynamics do not evolve on a manifold in the typical sense
required to apply Poincar\'e-Hopf Theory. Subsequently, Morse inequalities are
used to tighten the counting results, under the reasonable assumption that the
bivirus system is a Morse-Smale dynamical system. Numerical examples are
provided which demonstrate the presence of multiple attractor equilibria, and
multiple coexistence equilibria.

we demonstrate how GPU implementation can prevent pirates from deactivating the

GPUs do not support debugging directly on the hardware, and therefore all the

generally does not have any visibility on codes running on GPU, which comes as
an added benefit for our work. We provide an implementation on GPU to show the

generally more vulnerable to privacy attacks than CNNs. We further demonstrate
that the micro design of activation layers, stem layers, and bias parameters,

potential to reduce or amplify inequality in access to opportunity. We show
empirically that social networks often exhibit a much larger potential for
unequal diffusion across groups along paths of length 2 and 3 than expected by
our random graph models. We argue that homophily alone cannot not fully explain
the extent of unequal diffusion and attribute this mismatch to unequal
distribution of cross-group links among the nodes. Based on this insight, we
develop a variant of the stochastic block model that incorporates the
heterogeneity in cross-group linking. The model provides an unbiased and
consistent estimate of assortativity or homophily on paths of length 2 and
provide a more accurate estimate along paths of length 3 than existing models.
We characterize the null distribution of its log-likelihood ratio test and
argue that the goodness of fit test is valid only when the network is dense.
Based on our empirical observations and modeling results, we conclude that the
impact of any departure from equal distribution of links to source nodes in the
diffusion process is not limited to its first order effects as some nodes will
have fewer direct links to the sources. More importantly, this unequal
distribution will also lead to second order effects as the whole group will
have fewer diffusion paths to the sources.

of each user-item interaction. We investigate the geometric interpretation of
BC loss, then further visualize and theoretically prove that it simultaneously
learns better head and tail representations by encouraging the compactness of
similar users/items and enlarging the dispersion of dissimilar users/items.
Over eight benchmark datasets, we use BC loss to optimize two high-performing

split, fully-observed unbiased, tail/head test evaluations), BC loss
outperforms the state-of-the-art debiasing and non-debiasing methods with

forces exerted by a smaller number of external agents is called the shepherding
problem. This problem has attracted attention due to its potential
applications, including diverting birds away for preventing airplane accidents,
recovering spilled oil in the ocean, and guiding a swarm of robots for mapping.
Although there have been various studies on the shepherding problem, most of
them place the uniformity assumption on the dynamics of agents to be guided.
However, we can find various practical situations where this assumption does
not necessarily hold. In this paper, we propose a shepherding method for a
flock of agents consisting of normal agents to be guided and other variant
agents. In this method, the shepherd discriminates normal and variant agents
based on their behaviors' deviation from the one predicted by the potentially
inaccurate model of the normal agents. As for the discrimination process, we
propose two methods using static and dynamic thresholds. Our simulation results
show that the proposed methods outperform a conventional method for various
types of variant agents.

synthesis tasks as well as density estimation. Applied in the latent space of a
powerful pretrained autoencoder (LDM), their immense computational requirements
can be significantly reduced without sacrificing sampling quality. However, DMs
and LDMs lack a semantically meaningful representation space as the diffusion
process gradually destroys information in the latent variables. We introduce a
framework for learning such representations with diffusion models (LRDM). To
that end, a LDM is conditioned on the representation extracted from the clean
image by a separate encoder. In particular, the DM and the representation
encoder are trained jointly in order to learn rich representations specific to
the generative denoising process. By introducing a tractable representation
prior, we can efficiently sample from the representation distribution for
unconditional image synthesis without training of any additional model. We
demonstrate that i) competitive image generation results can be achieved with
image-parameterized LDMs, ii) LRDMs are capable of learning semantically
meaningful representations, allowing for faithful image reconstructions and
semantic interpolations. Our implementation is available at

Related work has studied the robustness of horizontal FL scenarios under

incorporate individual preferences. We shape individual preferences through a
set of utility functions to guarantee the resource price at a competitive

affordability threshold. We show this problem is solvable at the conceptual
level. Next, we consider quadratic MAS and formulate the associated social
shaping problem as a multi-agent linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem which
enables us to propose explicit utility sets using quadratic programming and
dynamic programming. Then, a numerical algorithm is presented for calculating a
tight range of the preference function parameters which guarantees a socially

feasibility assumptions, any competitive equilibrium maximizes the social
welfare. Then, we prove that for sufficiently small initial conditions, the
social welfare maximization solution constitutes a competitive equilibrium with

a time instant after which the optimal price, corresponding to a competitive

insertions into the electromagnetic vertex of the lepton $L$ up to three closed
lepton loops. The corresponding analytical expressions are obtained as
functions of the mass ratios $r=m_l/m_L$ in the whole region $0 < r < \infty$.
Our consideration is based on a combined use of the dispersion relations for
the polarization operators and the Mellin-Barnes integral transform for the
Feynman parametric integrals. This method is widely used in the literature in
multi-loop calculations in relativistic quantum field theories. For each order
of the radiative correction, we derive analytical expressions as functions of

Consequently, for each order of corrections there is a unique analytical
function defined in the whole range of~$r\in (0,\infty)$.

The method uses a differential equation that relates prevalence, incidence and

those without the condition.
  To demonstrate feasibility, a simulation based on the illness-death model

investigate this viscoelasticity under small amplitude oscillatory loadings in
micron-scale membrane area. We use hydrodynamic equations of bilayer membranes,
obtained by Onsager's variational principle, wherein the fluid membrane is
assumed to be an almost planar bilayer membrane. Simulations are performed for
a wide range of oscillatory frequencies f and membrane tensions. Our numerical
results show that as frequencies increase, membrane characteristics shift from
an elastic-dominant to viscous-dominant state. Furthermore, such state

frequencies between $O(f) = 10^1-10^2$ Hz, and almost independently of surface

training environment can make empirical risk minimization (ERM) perform badly
in the test environment. To address this problem, Kirichenko et al. (2022)
empirically found that the core features that are related to the outcome can
still be learned well even with the presence of spurious correlations. This
opens a promising strategy to first train a feature learner rather than a
classifier, and then perform linear probing (last layer retraining) in the test
environment. However, a theoretical understanding of when and why this approach
works is lacking. In this paper, we find that core features are only learned
well when their associated non-realizable noise is smaller than that of
spurious features, which is not necessarily true in practice. We provide both
theories and experiments to support this finding and to illustrate the
importance of non-realizable noise. Moreover, we propose an algorithm called
Freeze then Train (FTT), that first freezes certain salient features and then
trains the rest of the features using ERM. We theoretically show that FTT
preserves features that are more beneficial to test time probing. Across two
commonly used spurious correlation datasets, FTT outperforms ERM, IRM, JTT and
CVaR-DRO, with substantial improvement in accuracy (by 4.5%) when the feature
noise is large. FTT also performs better on general distribution shift
benchmarks.

over the sky, they are still in the dark to understand what causes the
phenomena because the existing radio observatories have encountered certain
challenges during the discovery of FRB progenitors. The construction of
Bustling Universe Radio Survey Telescope in Taiwan (BURSTT) is being proposed
to solve these challenges. We simulate mock Galactic FRB-like events by
applying a range of spatial distributions, pulse widths and luminosity
functions. The effect of turbulent Interstellar Medium (ISM) on the
detectability of FRB-like events within the Milky Way plane is considered to
estimate the dispersion measure and pulse scattering of mock events. We
evaluate the fraction of FRB-like events in the Milky Way that are detectable
by BURSTT and compare the result with those by Survey for Transient
Astronomical Radio Emission 2 (STARE2) and Galactic Radio Explorer (GReX). We
find that BURSTT could increase the detection rate by more than two orders of
magnitude compared with STARE2 and GReX, depending on the slope of luminosity
function of the events. We also investigate the influence of the specifications
of BURSTT on its detection improvement. This leads to the fact that greatly
higher sensitivity and improved coverage of the Milky Way plane have
significant effects on the detection improvement of BURSTT. We find that the
upgrade version of BURSTT, BURSTT-2048 could increase the detection rate of
faint Galactic FRB-like events by a factor of 3.

challenging and time-consuming. The recent breakthrough of large-batch
optimization is a promising way to tackle this challenge. However, although the
current advanced algorithms such as LARS and LAMB succeed in classification
models, the complicated pipelines of dense visual predictions such as object
detection and segmentation still suffer from the heavy performance drop in the
large-batch training regime. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet
effective algorithm, named Adaptive Gradient Variance Modulator (AGVM), which
can train dense visual predictors with very large batch size, enabling several
benefits more appealing than prior arts. Firstly, AGVM can align the gradient
variances between different modules in the dense visual predictors, such as
backbone, feature pyramid network (FPN), detection, and segmentation heads. We
show that training with a large batch size can fail with the gradient variances
misaligned among them, which is a phenomenon primarily overlooked in previous
work. Secondly, AGVM is a plug-and-play module that generalizes well to many
different architectures (e.g., CNNs and Transformers) and different tasks
(e.g., object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and
panoptic segmentation). It is also compatible with different optimizers (e.g.,
SGD and AdamW). Thirdly, a theoretical analysis of AGVM is provided. Extensive
experiments on the COCO and ADE20K datasets demonstrate the superiority of
AGVM. For example, it can train Faster R-CNN+ResNet50 in 4 minutes without
losing performance. AGVM enables training an object detector with one billion
parameters in just 3.5 hours, reducing the training time by 20.9x, whilst
achieving 62.2 mAP on COCO. The deliverables are released at

additional computational costs, post-hoc explanation approaches have been
widely adopted due to the generality of their architectures. Intrinsically
interpretable models provide instant explanations but are usually
model-specific, which can only explain particular GNNs. Therefore, we propose a
novel GNN explanation framework named SCALE, which is general and fast for
explaining predictions. SCALE trains multiple specialty learners to explain
GNNs since constructing one powerful explainer to examine attributions of
interactions in input graphs is complicated. In training, a black-box GNN model
guides learners based on an online knowledge distillation paradigm. In the
explanation phase, explanations of predictions are provided by multiple
explainers corresponding to trained learners. Specifically, edge masking and

that perform image classification. Many methods aim to bestow this property to
models by the use of data augmentation strategies, while more formal guarantees
are obtained via the use of equivariant models. We recognise that
compositional, or part-whole structure is also an important aspect of images
that has to be considered for building transformation-robust models. Thus, we
propose a capsule network model that is, at once, equivariant and
compositionality-aware. Equivariance of our capsule network model comes from
the use of equivariant convolutions in a carefully-chosen novel architecture.
The awareness of compositionality comes from the use of our proposed novel,
iterative, graph-based routing algorithm, termed Iterative collaborative
routing (ICR). ICR, the core of our contribution, weights the predictions made
for capsules based on an iteratively averaged score of the degree-centralities
of its nearest neighbours. Experiments on transformed image classification on
FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 show that our model that uses ICR
outperforms convolutional and capsule baselines to achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

introduced in this work's predecessor), followed by (ii) a forgetful functor
from $\mathsf{GPC}$ to the category of groups. These definable cohomology
functors powerfully refine their classical counterparts: we show that they are
complete invariants, for example, of the homotopy types of mapping telescopes
of $d$-spheres or $d$-tori for any $d\geq 1$, and, in contrast, that there
exist uncountable families of pairwise homotopy inequivalent mapping telescopes
of either sort on which the classical cohomology functors are constant. We then
apply the functors $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n_{\mathrm{def}}$ to provide strong
solutions to higher-dimensional and equivariant generalizations of a seminal

1936 problem of classifying, up to homotopy, the maps from a solenoid

are promising solid-state quantum emitters for photonic applications and
quantum networks. Despite their favorable properties, it has so far remained
elusive to determine the origin of these emitters. We focus on two different
kinds of hBN samples that particularly lend themselves for integration with
nanophotonic devices, multilayer nanoflakes produced by liquid phase
exfoliation (LPE) and a layer engineered sample from hBN grown by chemical
vapour deposition (CVD). We investigate their inherent defects and fit their
emission properties to computationally simulated optical properties of likely
carbon-related defects. Thereby we are able to narrow down the origin of
emitters found in these samples and find that the C2CB defect fits our spectral
data best. In addition, we demonstrate a scalable way of coupling LPE hBN to
optical nanofibers that are directly connected to optical fibers. Our work
brings us one step closer to specifying the origin of hBN's promising quantum
emitters and sheds more light onto the characteristics of emitters in samples
that are particularly suited for integration with nanophotonics. This knowledge
will prove invaluable for novel nanophotonic platforms and may contribute
towards the employment of hBN for future quantum technologies.

have a reality to them that is independent of the states that stimulate their
senses. This is the Principle of Instrument Autonomy. Although the mathematical
concept of an instrument implicitly embodies this principle, the conventional
analysis of continual observation has become overwhelmingly focused on state
evolution rather than on descriptions of instruments themselves. Because of
this, it can be hard to appreciate that an instrument that observes for a
finite amount of time has an evolution of its own, a stochastic evolution that
precedes the Born rule and Schr\""odinger equation of the measured system. In
this article, the two most established of the continually observing
instruments, the Srinivas-Davies photodetector and the Goetsch-Graham-Wiseman
heterodyne detector, are reviewed with an emphasis on the autonomous instrument
evolution they define, made explicit by application of the recently introduced
Kraus-operator distribution function. It is then pointed out how the heterodyne
instrument evolution is a complete alternative to the original idea of energy
quantization, where the usual ideas of \emph{temperature} and \emph{energy} of
a \emph{state} are replaced by the \emph{time} and \emph{positivity} of the

low-density environments. Four of the ETGs have massive (approximately 10^9
Msolar), extended molecular gas reservoirs with effective radii of
approximately 3 to 5 kpc. This work provides a kinematic and structural
analysis of these observations, to explore possible evolutionary mechanisms.
Axisymmetric or bisymmetric kinematic models were fitted to observations of
molecular gas discs, to quantify the dominant structures present and highlight
additional structures or asymmetries. Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations of
these ETGs were also examined where available. Two of the ETGs, GAMA64646 and
622305, appear to have undergone tidal disturbance leading to molecular gas
discs and/or star-forming inner rings. GAMA272990 may have undergone a merger,
leading to an elliptical galaxy with an embedded star-forming molecular gas
disc. GAMA622429 has probably undergone a minor merger, indicated by asymmetry
in molecular gas distribution and disturbance in optical images. The remaining
ETG, GAMA177186, was affected by source confusion from an offset source which
could be a high mass, dust- and gas- rich object at high redshift. Overall, it
appears that a high proportion of dusty ETGs in low-density environments have
massive, extended molecular gas reservoirs, and have undergone some kind of
interaction as part of their recent evolution. Secular evolution can then
(re-)transform the ETGs from star-forming to passive galaxies.

polyhedral domain. The Gaussian noise is white in time, spatially correlated,
and modeled as a standard cylindrical Wiener process on a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space. This paper provides the first rigorous analysis of the resulting
noise discretization error for a general spatial covariance kernel. The kernel
is assumed to be defined on a larger regular domain, allowing for sampling by
the circulant embedding method. The error bound under mild kernel assumptions
requires non-trivial techniques like Hilbert--Schmidt bounds on products of
finite element interpolants, entropy numbers of fractional Sobolev space
embeddings and an error bound for interpolants in fractional Sobolev norms.
Examples with kernels encountered in applications are illustrated in numerical
simulations using the FEniCS finite element software. Key findings include:
noise interpolation does not introduce additional errors for Mat\'ern kernels
in $d\ge2$; there exist kernels that yield dominant interpolation errors; and
generating noise on a coarser mesh does not always compromise accuracy.

exoplanet atmospheres and may lead to surface sterilization, it might also
provide the extra energy for low-mass stars needed to trigger and sustain
prebiotic chemistry. We investigate two flares on TRAPPIST-1, an ultra-cool
dwarf star that hosts seven exoplanets of which three lie within its habitable
zone. The flares are detected in all four passbands of the MuSCAT2 allowing a
determination of their temperatures and bolometric energies. We analyzed the
light curves of the MuSCAT1 and MuSCAT2 instruments obtained between 2016 and
2021 in $g,r,i,z_\mathrm{s}$-filters. We conducted an automated flare search
and visually confirmed possible flare events. We studied the temperature
evolution, the global temperature, and the peak temperature of both flares. For
the first time we infer effective black body temperatures of flares that
occurred on TRAPPIST-1. The black body temperatures for the two TRAPPIST-1
flares derived from the SED are consistent with $T_\mathrm{SED} =
7940_{-390}^{+430}$K and $T_\mathrm{SED} = 6030_{-270}^{+300}$K. The flare
black body temperatures at the peak are also calculated from the peak SED
yielding $T_\mathrm{SEDp} = 13620_{-1220}^{1520}$K and $T_\mathrm{SEDp} =
8290_{-550}^{+660}$K. We show that for the ultra-cool M-dwarf TRAPPIST-1 the
flare black body temperatures associated with the total continuum emission are
lower and not consistent with the usually adopted assumption of 9000-10000 K.
This could imply different and faster cooling mechanisms. Further multi-color
observations are needed to investigate whether or not our observations are a
general characteristic of ultra-cool M-dwarfs. This would have significant
implications for the habitability of exoplanets around these stars because the
UV surface flux is likely to be overestimated by the models with higher flare
temperatures.

the CNN's filter weights or activation maps, post-training. Here, we present a
new filter-importance-scoring concept named pruning by active attention
manipulation (PAAM), that sparsifies the CNN's set of filters through a
particular attention mechanism, during-training. PAAM learns analog filter
scores from the filter weights by optimizing a cost function regularized by an
additive term in the scores. As the filters are not independent, we use
attention to dynamically learn their correlations. Moreover, by training the
pruning scores of all layers simultaneously, PAAM can account for layer
inter-dependencies, which is essential to finding a performant sparse
sub-network. PAAM can also train and generate a pruned network from scratch in
a straightforward, one-stage training process without requiring a pre-trained
network. Finally, PAAM does not need layer-specific hyperparameters and
pre-defined layer budgets, since it can implicitly determine the appropriate
number of filters in each layer. Our experimental results on different network
architectures suggest that PAAM outperforms state-of-the-art structured-pruning
methods (SOTA). On CIFAR-10 dataset, without requiring a pre-trained baseline
network, we obtain 1.02% and 1.19% accuracy gain and 52.3% and 54% parameters
reduction, on ResNet56 and ResNet110, respectively. Similarly, on the ImageNet
dataset, PAAM achieves 1.06% accuracy gain while pruning 51.1% of the
parameters on ResNet50. For Cifar-10, this is better than the SOTA with a
margin of 9.5% and 6.6%, respectively, and on ImageNet with a margin of 11%.

estimating polyserial and polychoric correlation coefficients in this paper. It
iteratively calculates the slopes in a series of weighted linear regression
models fitting on conditional expected values. For polyserial correlation
coefficient, conditional expectations of the latent predictor is derived from
the observed ordinal categorical variable, and the regression coefficient is
obtained using weighted least squares method. In estimating polychoric
correlation coefficient, conditional expectations of the response variable and
the predictor are updated in turns. Standard errors of the estimators are
obtained using the delta method based on data summaries instead of the whole
data. Conditional univariate normal distribution is exploited and a single
integral is numerically evaluated in the proposed algorithm, comparing to the
double integral computed numerically based on the bivariate normal distribution
in the traditional maximum likelihood (ML) approaches. This renders the new
algorithm very fast in estimating both polyserial and polychoric correlation
coefficients. Thorough simulation studies are conducted to compare the
performances of the proposed method with the classical ML methods. Real data
analyses illustrate the advantage of the new method in computation speed.

support more complex refactorings or those that are specific to a given code
base. For those, as a flexible - albeit less interactive - alternative,
developers can write refactoring scripts that can implement arbitrarily complex
logic by manipulating the program's tree representation. In this work, we
present Forest, a structural code editor that aims to bridge the gap between
the interactiveness of code editors and the expressiveness of refactoring
scripts. While structural editors have occupied a niche as general code
editors, the key insight of this work is that they enable a novel structural
multi-cursor design that allows Forest to reach a similar expressiveness as
refactoring scripts; Forest allows to perform a single action simultaneously in
multiple program locations and thus support complex refactorings. To support
interactivity, Forest provides features typical for text code editors such as
writing and displaying the program through its textual representation. Our
evaluation demonstrates that Forest allows performing edits similar to those
from refactoring scripts, while still being interactive. We attempted to
perform edits from 48 real-world refactoring scripts using Forest and found
that 11 were possible, while another 17 would be possible with added features.
We believe that a multi-cursor setting plays to the strengths of structural
editing, since it benefits from reliable and expressive commands. Our results
suggest that multi-cursor structural editors could be practical for performing

making. Robust optimization emerged as one of the predominant paradigms to
produce solutions that hedge against uncertainty. In order to obtain an even
more realistic description of the underlying problem where the decision maker
can react to newly disclosed information, multistage models can be used.
However, due to their computational difficulty, multistage problems beyond two
stages have received less attention and are often only addressed using
approximation rather than optimization schemes. Even less attention is paid to
the consideration of decision-dependent uncertainty in a multistage setting. We
explore multistage robust optimization via quantified linear programs, which
are linear programs with ordered variables that are either existentially or
universally quantified. Building upon a (mostly) discrete setting where the
uncertain parameters -- the universally quantified variables -- are only
restricted by their bounds, we present an augmented version that allows stating
the discrete uncertainty set via a linear constraint system that also can be
affected by decision variables. We present a general search-based solution
approach and introduce our solver Yasol that is able to deal with multistage
robust linear discrete optimization problems, with final mixed-integer recourse
actions and a discrete uncertainty set, which even can be decision-dependent.
In doing so, we provide a convenient model-and-run approach, that can serve as

terms of the time-varying discrete Jacobi polynomial transform of the log-risk
process. The n-dimensional microscale point pattern evolution in time at
different manifold spatial scales is then characterized from such a transform.
The simulation study undertaken illustrates the construction of spherical point
process models displaying aggregation at low Legendre polynomial transform
frequencies (large scale), while regularity is observed at high frequencies
(small scale). K-function analysis supports these results under temporal
short-, intermediate- and long-range dependence of the log-risk process.

handle the high-dimensionality of real-world continuous control tasks. In this
context, Trust Region Policy Optimization methods represent a popular approach
to stabilize the policy updates. These usually rely on the Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence to limit the change in the policy. The Wasserstein distance
represents a natural alternative, in place of the KL divergence, to define
trust regions or to regularize the objective function. However,
state-of-the-art works either resort to its approximations or do not provide an
algorithm for continuous state-action spaces, reducing the applicability of the
method. In this paper, we explore optimal transport discrepancies (which
include the Wasserstein distance) to define trust regions, and we propose a
novel algorithm - Optimal Transport Trust Region Policy Optimization (OT-TRPO)
- for continuous state-action spaces. We circumvent the infinite-dimensional
optimization problem for PO by providing a one-dimensional dual reformulation
for which strong duality holds. We then analytically derive the optimal policy
update given the solution of the dual problem. This way, we bypass the
computation of optimal transport costs and of optimal transport maps, which we
implicitly characterize by solving the dual formulation. Finally, we provide an
experimental evaluation of our approach across various control tasks. Our
results show that optimal transport discrepancies can offer an advantage over
state-of-the-art approaches.

better describe nuclear structure phenomenology. Among these terms, the tensor
one is known to impact nuclear structure properties, especially in neutron-rich
nuclei. However, its effect has not been studied on the whole nuclear chart
yet.
  Purpose: The impact of terms corresponding to the tensor at the Hartree
level, is studied for infinite nuclear matter as well as deformed nuclei, by
developing new density-dependent functionals including these terms. In
particular, we study in details the improvement such a term can bring to the
description of specific nuclear observables.
  Methods: The framework of covariant energy density functional is used at the
Hartree-Bogoliubov level. The free parameters of covariant functionals are
optimized by combining Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo and simplex algorithms.
  Results: An improvement of the RMS binding energies, spin-orbit splittings
and gaps is obtained over the nuclear chart, including axially deformed ones,
when including tensors terms. Small modifications of the potential energy
surface and densities are also found. In infinite matter, the Dirac mass is
shifted to a larger value, in better agreement with experiments.
  Conclusions: Taking into account additional terms corresponding to the tensor
terms in the vector-isoscalar channel at the Hartree level, improves the
description of nuclear properties, both in nuclei and in nuclear matter.

is only active in the heterostructured Au/CuS NCs. By investigating the charge
carrier dynamics of the process, we find that the observed interaction is
charge carrier based as it is faster than phononic or thermal processes (< 100

heterostructured nanocrystals, also indicating, that the interaction occurs as
an energy transfer or charge carrier transfer between both materials. Our
results strengthen the understanding of multiplasmonic interactions in

advancements in this direction by advocating open access, and recently also
recommending authors to make their code public - both aspects being adopted by
the majority of the conference submissions. This helps the reproducibility of
the methods, however, there is currently little or no support for further
evaluation of these supplementary material, making them vulnerable to poor
quality, which affects the impact of the entire submission. We have evaluated
all accepted full paper submissions to MIDL between 2018 and 2022 using

quality of the public repositories. The evaluations show that publishing
repositories and using public datasets are becoming more popular, which helps
traceability, but the quality of the repositories has not improved over the
years, leaving room for improvement in every aspect of designing repositories.
Merely 22% of all submissions contain a repository that were deemed repeatable
using our evaluations. From the commonly encountered issues during the
evaluations, we propose a set of guidelines for machine learning-related

transformer integrating neighbors content based on their contribution to the
type inference through information exchange between neighbor pairs.

we propose a new general method to compute exact expressions for the BCH
formula. In its utmost generality, the method consists in embedding the Lie
algebra of interest into a subalgebra of the algebra of vector fields on some
manifold by means of an isomorphism, so that the BCH formula for two elements
of the original algebra can be recovered from the composition of the flows of
the corresponding vector fields. For this reason we call our method the flow

be computed analytically. We illustrate its usefulness on some benchmark

the physics and chemistry of the interstellar medium. Based on a number of
recent experimental and theoretical investigations we developed a model in
which PAHs are subject to photo-dissociation (carbon and hydrogen loss) and
hydrogenation. We take into account that dehydrogenated PAHs may fold into
closed structures -- fullerenes. Fullerenes, in their turn, can be also
hydrogenated, becoming fulleranes, and photo-dissociated, losing carbon and
hydrogen atoms. The carbon loss leads to shrinking of fullerene cages to
smaller ones. We calculate the abundance of PAHs and fullerenes of different
sizes and hydrogenation level depending on external conditions: the gas
temperature, intensity of radiation field, number density of hydrogen atoms,
carbon atoms, and electrons. We highlight the conditions, which are favourable
for fullerene formation from PAHs, and we conclude that this mechanism works
not only in H-poor environment but also at modest values of hydrogen density up
to 10$^{4}$~cm$^{-3}$. We found that fulleranes can be formed in the ISM,
although the fraction of carbon atoms locked in them can be maximum around
10$^{-9}$. We applied our model to two photo-dissociation regions, Orion Bar
and NGC 7023. We compare our estimates of the fullerene abundance and synthetic
band intensities in these objects with the observations and conclude that our
model gives good results for the closest surroundings of ionising stars. We
also demonstrate that additional fullerene formation channels should operate
along with UV-induced formation to explain abundance of fullerenes far from UV
sources.

electrodynamics for strong fields. It could have significant implications for
the study of black holes and cosmology and have been extensively studied in the
literature, extending from quantum to cosmological contexts. Recently, its
application to black holes, inflation and dark energy has caught on, being able
to provide an accelerated Universe and address some current theoretical
inconsistencies, such as the Big Bang singularity. In this work, we report two
new ways to investigate these non-linear theories. First, we have analyzed the
Blandford-Znajeck mechanism in light of this promising theoretical context,
providing the general form of the extracted power up to second order in the
black hole spin parameter $a$. We have found that, depending on the NLED model,
the emitted power can be extremely increased or decreased, and that the
magnetic field lines around the black hole seems to become vertical quickly.
Considering only separated solutions, we have found that no monopole solutions
exist and this could have interesting astrophysical consequences (not
considered here). Last but not least, we attempted to confine the NLED
parameters by inducing the amplification of primordial magnetic fields
('seeds'), thus admitting non-linear theories already during the early stages
of the Universe. However, the latter approach proved to be useful for NLED
research only in certain models. Our (analytical) results emphasize that the
existence and behavior of non-linear electromagnetic phenomena strongly depend
on the physical context and that only a power-low model seems to have any
chance to compete with Maxwell.

deterministic relationship between the remaining context and the masked

can be deterministically inferable based on the existing clues in the context.
That would provide more stable patterns for PLMs to capture factual knowledge
than randomly masking. Two pre-training tasks are further introduced to
motivate PLMs to rely on the deterministic relationship when filling masks.
Specifically, we use an external Knowledge Base (KB) to identify deterministic
relationships and continuously pre-train PLMs with the proposed methods. The
factual knowledge probing experiments indicate that the continuously
pre-trained PLMs achieve better robustness in factual knowledge capturing.
Further experiments on question-answering datasets show that trying to learn a

information about the medium composition and implement suitable growth
strategies by adjusting their regulatory and metabolic degrees of freedom. In
the standard sense, optimal strategy selection is achieved when bacteria grow
at the fastest rate possible in that medium. While this view of optimality is
well suited for cells that have perfect knowledge about their surroundings
(e.g. nutrient levels), things are more involved in uncertain or fluctuating
conditions, especially when changes occur over timescales comparable to (or
faster than) those required to organize a response. Information theory however
provides recipes for how cells can choose the optimal growth strategy under
uncertainty about the stress levels they will face. Here we analyse the
theoretically optimal scenarios for a coarse-grained, experiment-inspired model
of bacterial metabolism for growth in a medium described by the (static)
probability density of a single variable (the `stress level'). We show that
heterogeneity in growth rates consistently emerges as the optimal response when
the environment is sufficiently complex and/or when perfect adjustment of
metabolic degrees of freedom is not possible (e.g. due to limited resources).
In addition, outcomes close to those achievable with unlimited resources are
often attained effectively with a modest amount of fine tuning. In other terms,
heterogeneous population structures in complex media may be rather robust with

of $\binom{[n]}{k}$ are called $k$-graphs. A $k$-graph $\mathcal{F}$ is called
$t$-intersecting if $|F\cap F'|\geq t$ for all $F,F'\in \mathcal{F}$. One of
the central results of extremal set theory is the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem
which states that for $n\geq (k-t+1)(t+1)$ no $t$-intersecting $k$-graph has
more than $\binom{n-t}{k-t}$ edges. For $n$ greater than this threshold the
$t$-star (all $k$-sets containing a fixed $t$-set) is the only family attaining
this bound. Define $\mathcal{F}(i)=\{F\setminus \{i\}\colon i\in F\in

n}|\mathcal{F}(i)|/|\mathcal{F}|$ measures how close a $k$-graph is to a star.
The main result (Theorem 1.5) shows that $\varrho(\mathcal{F})>1/d$ holds if
$\mathcal{F}$ is 1-intersecting,
$|\mathcal{F}|>2^dd^{2d+1}\binom{n-d-1}{k-d-1}$ and $n\geq 4(d-1)dk$. Such a
statement can be deduced from the results of \cite{F78-2} and \cite{DF},
however only for much larger values of $n/k$ and/or $n$. The proof is purely

determined by their interaction with the ambient medium. A crucial role is
played by the contact discontinuity at the jet boundary, which in the presence
of jet collimation may become subject to Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) and
Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI). Here, we study the evolution of these
instabilities in non-magnetized relativistic jets using special relativistic
three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We show that the growth of initial
perturbations is consistent with relativistic RTI operating in the jet
collimation region. The contribution of RMI becomes important downstream from
the collimation shock in agreement with theoretical expectations. Both
instabilities reach non-linear scales above the shock convergence point and
trigger strong turbulence, mixing jet with ambient matter. We devise an
analytic solution for the mixing rate and show that it is sensitive to the
external density gradients. Our results may be applied to different types of
astrophysical objects. In particular, different contribution of interface
instabilities is a natural explanation for the observed dichotomy between FR-I
and FR-II radiogalaxies. The rapid slow-down in the jet of M87 is consistent
with baryon entrainment from the circumnuclear matter with the observed density
distribution. In microquasars, baryon loading triggered by interface
instabilities is a probable reason for the low observed Lorentz factors. We
show that the observed variability in gamma-ray bursts cannot come from mixing
driven by interface instabilities and likely originates from the engine,
suggesting the presence of magnetic fields in the jet.

these ambiguities via multiple hypotheses generation, produce miscalibrated

sample-based metrics such as minMPJPE. In a series of simulations, we show that
minimizing minMPJPE, as commonly done, should converge to the correct mean
prediction. However, it fails to correctly capture the uncertainty, thus
resulting in a miscalibrated distribution. To mitigate this problem, we propose
an accurate and well-calibrated model called Conditional Graph Normalizing Flow
(cGNFs). Our model is structured such that a single cGNF can estimate both
conditional and marginal densities within the same model - effectively solving
a zero-shot density estimation problem. We evaluate cGNF on the Human~3.6M

while being close to state-of-the-art in terms of overall minMPJPE.
Furthermore, cGNF outperforms previous methods on occluded joints while it

performing the specified facial expression. Our approach, referred to as
FEV-GAN (Facial Expression Video GAN), is based on Spatio-temporal
Convolutional GANs, that are known to model both content and motion in the same

generate coherent videos with smooth temporal evolution. However, they still
suffer from low image quality and low identity preservation capability. In this

analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in generating videos of
the six basic facial expressions while preserving the input identity. The
analysis also proves that the use of both identity and spatial features

quantum fields in any geometric background. Curvature also plays an important
role in setting up the correlations of a quantum field in a given spacetime.
For instance, massless fields are known to have large correlations in de Sitter
space as well as in certain class of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)
universes. However, some of the correlations are secular in nature while some
are dynamic and spacetime dependent. An Unruh deWitt detector responds to such
divergences differently in different spacetimes. In this work, we study the
response rate of Unruh deWitt detectors which interact with quantum fields in
FRW spacetimes. We consider both conventionally as well as derivatively coupled
Unruh deWitt detectors. Particularly, we consider their interaction with
massless scalar fields in FRW spacetimes and nearly massless scalar fields in
de Sitter spacetime. We discuss how the term which gives rise to the infrared
divergence in the massless limit in de Sitter spacetime manifests itself at the
level of the response rate of these Unruh deWitt detectors in a wide class of
Friedmann spacetimes. To carry out this study, we use an equivalence between
massless scalar fields in FRW spacetimes with massive scalar fields in de
Sitter spacetime. Further, we show that while the derivative coupling regulates
the divergence appearing in de Sitter spacetime, it does not completely remove
them in matter dominated universe. This gives rise to large transitions in the
detector which can be used as a probe of setting up of large correlations in
late time era of the universe as well. We show that the coupling of hydrogen
atoms with gravitational waves takes a form that is similar to derivatively
coupled UdW detectors and hence has significant observational implications as a
probe of late time revival of quantum correlators.

pseudo-labels are generated for both partial and unlabeled examples through
confidence-based thresholding and contrastive learning is performed in a hybrid

  uptake of pesticides",,,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The global importance of effective and affordable pesticides to optimise crop
yield and to support health of our growing population cannot be understated.
But to develop new products or refine existing ones in response to climate and
environmental changes is both time-intensive and expensive which is why the
agrochemical industry is increasingly interested in using mechanistic models as
part of their formulation development toolbox. In this work, we develop such a
model to describe uptake of pesticide spray droplets across the leaf surface.
We simplify the leaf structure by identifying the outer cuticle as the main
barrier to uptake; the result is a novel, hybrid model in which two well-mixed
compartments are separated by a membrane in which we describe the
spatio-temporal distribution of the pesticide. This leads to a boundary value
partial differential equation problem coupled to a pair of ordinary
differential equation systems which we solve numerically. We also simplify the
pesticide formulation into two key components: the Active Ingredient which
produces the desired effect of the pesticide and an Adjuvant which is present
in the formulation to facilitate effective absorption of the Active Ingredient
into the leaf. This approach gives rise to concentration-dependent diffusion.
We take an intuitive approach to parameter estimation using a small
experimental data set and subsequently demonstrate the importance of the
concentration-dependent diffusion in replicating the data. Finally, we
demonstrate the need for further work to identify how the physicochemical
properties of pesticides affect flow into and across the leaf surface.

characterization, especially in high-precision radial velocity instruments.
Blind-search radial velocity surveys thus require a dedicated observational
strategy in order to optimize the observing time, which is particularly crucial
for the detection of small rocky worlds at large orbital periods. We develop an
algorithm with the purpose of improving the efficiency of radial velocity
observations in the context of exoplanet searches, and we apply it to the
K-dwarfs Orbited By habitable Exoplanets (KOBE) experiment. We aim at
accelerating exoplanet confirmations or, alternatively, rejecting false signals
as early as possible in order to save telescope time and increase the
efficiency of both blind-search surveys and follow-up of transiting candidates.
Once a minimum initial number of radial velocity datapoints is reached in such
a way that a periodicity starts to emerge according to generalized Lomb-Scargle
(GLS) periodograms, that period is targeted with the proposed algorithm, named
$\texttt{KOBEsim}$. The algorithm selects the next observing date that
maximizes the Bayesian evidence for such periodicity in comparison with a model
with no Keplerian orbits. By means of simulated data, we prove that the
algorithm accelerates the exoplanet detection, needing $29 - 33\,\%$ less
observations and $41 - 47\,\%$ less timespan of the full dataset for low-mass
planets ($m_{\rm p}\,<\,10\,M_{\oplus}$) in comparison with a conventional
monotonic cadence strategy. The enhancement in the number of datapoints for
$20\,M_{\oplus}$ planets is also appreciable, $16\,\%$. We also test
$\texttt{KOBEsim}$ with real data for a particular KOBE target, and for the
confirmed planet $HD~102365\,b$. Both of them demonstrate that the strategy is
capable of speeding up the detection up to a factor of $2$.

increasing trends of extremes, such as droughts and floods in India, the second

transfer from surplus to deficit river basins through reservoirs and canals,

Using information theory-based causal delineation techniques, a coupled
regional climate model, and multiple reanalysis datasets, we show that causal
pathways exist across different basins in India due to strong land-atmosphere
feedback, which disputes the generally practiced assumption of hydrological
independence between river basins. The causal information from one basin's land
crosses the basin boundary through the atmosphere. We further find that
increased irrigation from the transferred water reduces mean rainfall in
September by up to 12% in many parts of India most of which are already water
stressed.We observe more drying in La Nina years as compared to El Nino years.
Reduced September precipitation can lead to drying of rivers post monsoon
augmenting the water stress across country rendering interlinking
dysfunctional. These findings demand model-guided impact assessment studies of
large scale hydrological projects across the globe considering land-atmosphere

case-based reasoning (CBR) and the logical specification of classifiers.
Logical approaches to classifiers capture the connection between features and
outcomes in classifier systems. Factor-based reasoning is a popular approach to
reasoning by precedent in AI & Law. Horty (2011) has developed the factor-based
models of precedent into a theory of precedential constraint. In this paper we
combine the modal logic approach (binary-input classifier, BLC) to classifiers
and their explanations given by Liu & Lorini (2021) with Horty's account of
factor-based CBR, since both a classifier and CBR map sets of features to
decisions or classifications. We reformulate case bases of Horty in the
language of BCL, and give several representation results. Furthermore, we show
how notions of CBR, e.g. reason, preference between reasons, can be analyzed by
notions of classifier system.

real-time method for spatio-temporal action detection. We make a bunch of
little design changes to make it better. For network structure, we use the same
ones of official implemented YOWO, including 3D-ResNext-101 and YOLOv2, but we
use a better pretrained weight of our reimplemented YOLOv2, which is better
than the official YOLOv2. We also optimize the label assignment used in YOWO.
To accurately detection action instances, we deploy GIoU loss for box
regression. After our incremental improvement, YOWO achieves 84.9\% frame mAP
and 50.5\% video mAP on the UCF101-24, significantly higher than the official
YOWO. On the AVA, our optimized YOWO achieves 20.6\% frame mAP with 16 frames,
also exceeding the official YOWO. With 32 frames, our YOWO achieves 21.6 frame
mAP with 25 FPS on an RTX 3090 GPU. We name the optimized YOWO as YOWO-Plus.
Moreover, we replace the 3D-ResNext-101 with the efficient 3D-ShuffleNet-v2 to
design a lightweight action detector, YOWO-Nano. YOWO-Nano achieves 81.0 \%
frame mAP and 49.7\% video frame mAP with over 90 FPS on the UCF101-24. It also
achieves 18.4 \% frame mAP with about 90 FPS on the AVA. As far as we know,
YOWO-Nano is the fastest state-of-the-art action detector. Our code is

promise. Previous efforts used remote sensing, weather, planting, and soil data
to train machine learning models for yield prediction. However, while remote
sensing works well, the models require large amounts of data and cannot make
predictions until the harvesting season begins. Using weather and planting data
from alfalfa variety trials in Kentucky and Georgia, our previous work compared
feature selection techniques to find the best technique and best feature set.
In this work, we trained a variety of machine learning models, using cross

showed better accuracy than similar work that employed more complex techniques.
Our best individual model was a random forest with a mean absolute error of
0.081 tons/acre and R{$^2$} of 0.941. Next, we expanded this dataset to include

replacing a greater-equals operator in the implementation of a sorting

based on extensive incorporation of contextual knowledge. Context can be based
either on object co-occurrences in a scene or on memory of experience. In
accordance with the human visual cortex which uses context to form different

deep learning methods by using external contextual knowledge encoded in a

generic knowledge graph, transform the views into vector space and infuse it
into a DNN. We conduct a series of experiments to investigate the impact of
different contextual views on the learned object representations for the same

views influence the image representations in the DNN differently and therefore
lead to different predictions for the same images. We also show that context

Besides to the forecasts, during the years ALTA has been collecting statistics
on the atmospheric conditions which can be used to draw a very accurate
characterization of the climatology of the telescope site located on top of
Mount Graham, Arizona. Such characterization can be used both for the
optimization and calibration of the forecast model and as a reference for a
model validation. The climatology of these parameters is conceived to be a
further output of ALTA that will be upgraded on the website with time and it
will be able to put in evidence trends at short as well as long time scales. In
this contribution we present a climatological description of all the
atmospheric parameters relevant for ground-based astronomy in order to provide
to the scientific community a robust reference of the bserving conditions at

the images. To alleviate this problem, we present OCR-VQGAN, an image encoder,
and decoder that leverages OCR pre-trained features to optimize a text
perceptual loss, encouraging the architecture to preserve high-fidelity text
and diagram structure. To explore our approach, we introduce the Paper2Fig100k
dataset, with over 100k images of figures and texts from research papers. The
figures show architecture diagrams and methodologies of articles available at
arXiv.org from fields like artificial intelligence and computer vision. Figures
usually include text and discrete objects, e.g., boxes in a diagram, with lines
and arrows that connect them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OCR-VQGAN by
conducting several experiments on the task of figure reconstruction.
Additionally, we explore the qualitative and quantitative impact of weighting
different perceptual metrics in the overall loss function. We release code,

inversion symmetry in some superconducting systems, leads to an analogous
device - the superconducting diode. Following the pioneering first
demonstration of the superconducting diode effect (SDE), a plethora of new

to avoid pair production off of background radiation fields and survive to
reach detectors on Earth. By extrapolating the reported $0.1-1.0$\ GeV LAT

finite number of states that evolve deterministically and at discrete time
steps. Considered up to isomorphism, those correspond to functional graphs. As
such, FDSs have a sum and product operation, which correspond to the direct sum
and direct product of their respective graphs; the collection of FDSs endowed
with these operations then forms a semiring. The algebraic structure of the
product of FDSs is particularly interesting. For instance, an FDS can be
factorised if and only if it is composed of two sub-systems running in
parallel. In this work, we further the understanding of the factorisation,
division, and root finding problems for FDSs. Firstly, an FDS $A$ is
cancellative if one can divide by it unambiguously, i.e. $AX = AY$ implies $X =
Y$. We prove that an FDS $A$ is cancellative if and only if it has a fixpoint.
Secondly, we prove that if an FDS $A$ has a $k$-th root (i.e. $B$ such that
$B^k = A$), then it is unique. Thirdly, unlike integers, the monoid of FDS
product does not have unique factorisation into irreducibles. We instead
exhibit a large class of monoids of FDSs with unique factorisation. To obtain
our main results, we introduce the unrolling of an FDS, which can be viewed as
a space-time expansion of the system. This allows us to work with (possibly

  Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Enabling ultra-reliable and low-latency communication services while
providing massive connectivity is one of the major goals to be accomplished in
future wireless communication networks. In this paper, we investigate the
performance of a hybrid multi-access scheme in the finite blocklength (FBL)
regime that combines the advantages of both non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA) schemes. Two latency-sensitive
application scenarios are studied, distinguished by whether the queuing
behaviour has an influence on the transmission performance or not. In
particular, for the latency-critical case with one-shot transmission, we aim at
a certain physical-layer quality-of-service (QoS) performance, namely the
optimization of the reliability. And for the case in which queuing behaviour
plays a role, we focus on the link-layer QoS performance and provide a design
that maximizes the effective capacity. For both designs, we leverage the
characterizations in the FBL regime to provide the optimal framework by jointly
allocating the blocklength and transmit power of each user. In particular, for
the reliability-oriented design, the original problem is decomposed and the
joint convexity of sub-problems is shown via a variable substitution method.
For the effective-capacity-oriented design, we exploit the method of Lagrange
multipliers to formulate a solvable dual problem with strong duality to the
original problem. Via simulations, we validate our analytical results of
convexity/concavity and show the advantage of our proposed approaches compared
to other existing schemes.

condition, which are jointly optimized, via supervision of the CLIP loss, by a
spherical Gaussians based differentiable renderer. As such, TANGO enables
photorealistic 3D style transfer by automatically predicting reflectance
effects even for bare, low-quality meshes, without training on a task-specific
dataset. Extensive experiments show that TANGO outperforms existing methods of
text-driven 3D style transfer in terms of photorealistic quality, consistency
of 3D geometry, and robustness when stylizing low-quality meshes. Our codes and

has been extensively applied in the distributed parameter estimation and target
tracking of multitask network. However, its performance is mainly limited by
two aspects, i.e, the correlated input signal and impulsive noise interference.
To overcome these two limitations simultaneously, this paper firstly introduces
the subband adaptive filter (SAF) into the multitask network. Then, a robust
multitask diffusion normalized M-estimate subband adaptive filtering (MD-NMSAF)
algorithm is proposed by solving the modified Huber function based global
network optimization problem in a distributed manner, which endows the
multitask network strong decorrelation ability for correlated inputs and
robustness to impulsive noise interference, and accelerates the convergence of
the algorithm significantly. Compared with the robust multitask diffusion
affine projection M-estimate (MD-APM) algorithm, the computational complexity
of the proposed MD-NMSAF is greatly reduced. In addition, the stability
condition, the analytical expressions of the theoretical transient and
steady-state network mean square deviation (MSD) of the MD-NMSAF are also
provided and verified through computer simulations. Simulation results under

a learned locally factored dynamics model to an augmented distribution of

with a broader set of local structures than prior work and allows for direct

  Prediction from Echocardiogram Videos","Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is an important indicator of heart
failure. Existing methods for LVEF estimation from video require large amounts
of annotated data to achieve high performance, e.g. using 10,030 labeled
echocardiogram videos to achieve mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.10. Labeling
these videos is time-consuming however and limits potential downstream
applications to other heart diseases. This paper presents the first
semi-supervised approach for LVEF prediction. Unlike general video prediction
tasks, LVEF prediction is specifically related to changes in the left ventricle
(LV) in echocardiogram videos. By incorporating knowledge learned from
predicting LV segmentations into LVEF regression, we can provide additional
context to the model for better predictions. To this end, we propose a novel
Cyclical Self-Supervision (CSS) method for learning video-based LV
segmentation, which is motivated by the observation that the heartbeat is a
cyclical process with temporal repetition. Prediction masks from our
segmentation model can then be used as additional input for LVEF regression to
provide spatial context for the LV region. We also introduce teacher-student
distillation to distill the information from LV segmentation masks into an
end-to-end LVEF regression model that only requires video inputs. Results show
our method outperforms alternative semi-supervised methods and can achieve MAE
of 4.17, which is competitive with state-of-the-art supervised performance,
using half the number of labels. Validation on an external dataset also shows
improved generalization ability from using our method. Our code is available at

pre-trained models (PTMs) that simply prepends a soft prompt to the input and
only optimizes the prompt to adapt PTMs to downstream tasks. Although it is
parameter- and deployment-efficient, its performance still lags behind other
state-of-the-art PETuning methods. Besides, the training cost of prompt tuning
is not significantly reduced due to the back-propagation through the entire
model. Through empirical analyses, we shed some light on the lagging
performance of prompt tuning and recognize a trade-off between the propagation
distance from label signals to the inserted prompt and the influence of the
prompt on model outputs. Further, we present Late Prompt Tuning (LPT) that
inserts a late prompt into an intermediate layer of the PTM instead of the
input layer or all layers. The late prompt is obtained by a neural prompt
generator conditioned on the hidden states before the prompt insertion layer
and therefore is instance-dependent. Through extensive experimental results
across various tasks and PTMs, we show that LPT can achieve competitive
performance to full model tuning and other PETuning methods under both
full-data and few-shot scenarios while possessing faster training speed and
lower memory cost.

several puzzles of fundamental physics, first and foremost - neutrino
oscillations. Being sterile with respect to Standard Model interactions, these
particles admit Majorana masses, allowing for violation of the total lepton
number. Lepton number violating (LNV) processes thus become a key signature of
HNLs, pursued by many experiments. In this work, we demonstrate that if HNLs
are the sole origin of neutrino masses, destructive interference between
Majorana states suppresses the same-sign di-lepton signal. In the
phenomenologically interesting case of large HNL couplings, such suppression is
akin to the cancellation of HNLs' contributions to neutrino masses.
Nevertheless, the signal can be much larger than coming from the Weinberg
operator alone. We identify regions of the parameter space of such realistic
HNL models where the LNV signal is maximised at the LHC and future FCC-hh. Our
results are obtained within the effective W approximation which allows for
analytic treatment and gives a clear dependence on the model parameters.
Although approximate, they are argued to be correct within a factor of a few.

scale interaction of players where each player has a private type that is

field teams and games with \emph{correlated types} where there are a large
population of homogeneous players sequentially making strategic decisions and
each player is affected by other players through an aggregate population state.
Each player has a private type that only she observes and types of any $N$
players are correlated through a kernel $Q$. All players commonly observe a
correlated mean-field population state which represents the empirical
distribution of any $N$ players' correlated joint types. We define the
Mean-Field Team optimal Strategies (MFTO) as strategies of the players that
maximize total expected joint reward of the players. We also define Mean-Field
Equilibrium (MFE) in such games as solution of coupled Bellman dynamic
programming backward equation and Fokker Planck forward equation of the
correlated mean field state, where a player's strategy in an MFE depends on
both, her private type and current correlated mean field population state. We

compounds reaching a few thousands. In 2018 we first contributed to this effort
with the identification of 1825 compounds that are either easily (1036) or
potentially (789) exfoliable from experimentally known 3D compounds. Here, we
report on a major expansion of this 2D portfolio thanks to the extension of the
screening protocol to an additional experimental database (MPDS) as well as to
the updated versions of the two databases (ICSD and COD) used in our previous

monolayers, bringing the total to 3077 compounds and, notably, almost doubling

structural properties of all these monolayers and explored their electronic
structure with a particular emphasis on those rare large-bandgap 2D materials

Finally, for each material containing up to 6 atoms per unit cell, we
identified the best candidates to form commensurate heterostructures, balancing

simulations from the 1990's on, have irrevocably impaired the long-held belief
that the Solar System should be stable. But mathematical mechanisms explaining
this instability have remained mysterious. In 1968, Arnold conjectured the
existence of ""Arnold diffusion"" in celestial mechanics. We prove Arnold's
conjecture in the planetary spatial $4$-body problem as well as in the
corresponding hierarchical problem (where the bodies are increasingly
separated), and show that this diffusion leads, on a long time interval, to
some large-scale instability. Along the diffusive orbits, the mutual
inclination of the two inner planets is close to $\pi/2$, which hints at why
even marginal stability in planetary systems may exist only when inner planets
are not inclined.
  More precisely, consider the normalised angular momentum of the second
planet, obtained by rescaling the angular momentum by the square root of its
semimajor axis and by an adequate mass factor (its direction and norm give the
plane of revolution and the eccentricity of the second planet). It is a vector
of the unit $3$-ball. We show that any finite sequence in this ball may be
realised, up to an arbitrary precision, as a sequence of values of the
normalised angular momentum in the $4$-body problem. For example, the second
planet may flip from prograde nearly horizontal revolutions to retrograde ones.
As a consequence of the proof, the non-recurrent set of any finite-order
secular normal form accumulates on circular motions -- a weak form of a
celebrated conjecture of Herman.

other, termed $\it{sparing}$, under which values only above a dynamic threshold
are disclosed. We show how management are rewarded with a reputational premium
for candour. The candid strategy is costly because the sparing alternative
shields the firm from potential downgrades following low value disclosures. We
show how parameters of the model such as news intensity, pay-for-performance
and time-to-mandatory-disclosure determine the optimal choice of candid versus
sparing strategy and the optimal time for management to switch between the two.
The private news updates received by management are modelled with a Poisson
process, occurring between the fixed mandatory disclosure dates, such as fiscal
years or quarters, with the news received generated by a background
Black-Scholes model of economic activity and of its partial observation. The
model presented develops a number of insights, based on a very simple ordinary
differential equation (ODE) characterizing equilibrium in a
piecewise-deterministic model, derivable from the background Black-Scholes
model. It is shown that in equilibrium when news intensity is low a firm may
employ a candid disclosure strategy throughout, but will otherwise switch
(alternate) between periods of being candid and periods of being sparing with
the truth (or the other way about); that is, we are able to characterize when
in equilibrium a candid firm will switch to adopting a sparing strategy. The
model illustrates how parameters such as time to mandatory disclosure, news
intensity and pay-for-performance may drive such switching behaviour.
$\it{With\,constant\,pay\,for\,performance\,parameters,\,at\,most\,one\,
switching\,occurs.}$

Bellman mappings on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) are introduced
that need no knowledge on transition probabilities of Markov decision

An approximate policy-iteration framework is finally offered via the
introduction of a finite-dimensional affine superset of the fixed-point set of
the proposed Bellman mappings. The well-known ``curse of dimensionality'' in
RKHSs is addressed by building a basis of vectors via an approximate linear

proposed framework selects always the ``optimal'' p-norm for the outlier
scenario at hand, outperforming at the same time several non-RL and KBRL

of image and text matches or not. Such a binary indicator covers only a limited
subset of image-text semantic relations, which is insufficient to represent
relevance degrees between images and texts described by continuous labels such
as image captions. The visual-semantic embedding space obtained by learning
binary labels is incoherent and cannot fully characterize the relevance
degrees. In addition to the use of binary labels, this paper further
incorporates continuous pseudo labels (generally approximated by text
similarity between captions) to indicate the relevance degrees. To learn a
coherent embedding space, we propose an image-text retrieval framework with
Binary and Continuous Label Supervision (BCLS), where binary labels are used to
guide the retrieval model to learn limited binary correlations, and continuous
labels are complementary to the learning of image-text semantic relations. For
the learning of binary labels, we improve the common Triplet ranking loss with
Soft Negative mining (Triplet-SN) to improve convergence. For the learning of
continuous labels, we design Kendall ranking loss inspired by Kendall rank
correlation coefficient (Kendall), which improves the correlation between the
similarity scores predicted by the retrieval model and the continuous labels.
To mitigate the noise introduced by the continuous pseudo labels, we further
design Sliding Window sampling and Hard Sample mining strategy (SW-HS) to
alleviate the impact of noise and reduce the complexity of our framework to the
same order of magnitude as the triplet ranking loss. Extensive experiments on
two image-text retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method can improve the
performance of state-of-the-art image-text retrieval models.

was due to Christodoulou, who constructed a family $(\overline{g}_k,
\overline{\phi}_k)$ of $k$-self-similar solutions, for any $k^2 \in
(0,\frac{1}{3})$. We extend the construction to produce examples of interior
and exterior regions of naked singularity spacetimes locally modeled on the
$(\overline{g}_k, \overline{\phi}_k)$, without requiring exact self-similarity.
  The main result is a global stability statement under fine-tuned data
perturbations, for a class of naked singularity spacetimes satisfying
self-similar bounds. Given the well-known blueshift instability for suitably
regular naked singularities in the Einstein-scalar field model, we require
non-generic conditions on the data perturbations. In particular, the scalar
field perturbation along the past lightcone of the singular point $\mathcal{O}$
vanishes to high order near $\mathcal{O}$. Technical difficulties arise from
the singular behavior of the background solution, as well as regularity
considerations at the axis and past lightcone of the singularity. The interior
region is constructed via a backwards stability argument, thereby avoiding
activating the blueshift instability. The extension to the exterior region is
treated as a global existence problem to the future of $\mathcal{O}$, adapting
techniques of Rodnianski and Shlapentokh-Rothman for vacuum spacetimes.

using existing $\tau$-mass or $\tau$-color relations, typically established
based on an ensemble of different types of stars by assuming that $\tau$ is a
function of mass. In this work, we use {\it Gaia} Early Data Release 3 to
demonstrate that the masses used to establish one of the most cited $\tau$-mass
relations are overestimated for G type dwarfs and significantly underestimated
for late M dwarfs, offsets that affect studies using this $\tau$-mass relation
to draw conclusions. We discuss the challenges of creating such relations then
and now. In the era of {\it Gaia} and other large datasets, stars used to
establish these relations require characterization in a multi-dimensional

propose that new multi-dimensional relations should be established based on

suppress the wormhole contribution. In this work, we revisit the problem in a

  The leading anisotropic signal is stored in the dipole. Within the standard
cosmological model, it is interpreted as a bulk motion ($307 \pm 23$ km/s) of
the entire local volume in a direction aligned at better than $4$ degrees with
the bulk component of the Local Group velocity with respect to the CMB. This
term alone, however, provides an overly simplistic and inaccurate description
of the angular anisotropies of the expansion rate. We find that the quadrupole
contribution is non-negligible ($\sim 50\%$ of the anisotropic signal), in
fact, statistically significant, and signaling a substantial shearing of

  Black Hole mergers",,,"10.1093/mnras/stac3402",,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent detections of binary stellar mass black hole mergers by the LIGO
and Virgo Collaborations suggest that such mergers are common occurrences.
Galaxy mergers further indicate that supermassive black holes in centers of
galaxies also merge and are typically expected to have had at least one merger
in their lifetime, possibly many. In the presence of a jet, these mergers are
almost always accompanied by a change of the jet direction and a connected jet
precession motion, leading to interactions of the jet with ambient matter and
producing very high-energy particles, and consequently high-energy gamma-rays
and neutrinos. In this work, we investigate the possibility under which
conditions such mergers could be the sources of the diffuse astrophysical
neutrino flux measured by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The main free
parameters in the calculation concern the frequency of the mergers and the
fraction of energy that is transferred from the gravitationally released energy
to neutrinos. We show that the merger rate for SMBBHs must lie between $\sim
10^{-7}$ and $10^{-5}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. The ratio of energy going to
neutrinos during such mergers lies then between $\sim 10^{-6} - 3\cdot
10^{-4}$. For stellar mass BBH mergers, the rate needs to be $\sim 10-100$
Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ and the expected ratio of neutrino to gravitational wave
energy lies in a comparable range as for SMBBHs, $\sim 2 \cdot 10^{-5} -
10^{-3}$. These values lie in a reasonable parameter range, so that the
production of neutrinos at the level of the detected neutrino flux is a
realistic possibility.

and high engineering current density superconducting cables, the need for an
established, fast, and sufficiently accurate computational model for the
forecasting of AC-losses in cold-dielectric conductors, is pivotal for
increasing the investment confidence of power grid operators. However,
validating such models is not an easy task, this because on the one hand, there
is a low availability of experimental results for large scale power cables and,
on the other hand, there is a large number of 2G-HTS tapes involved whose
cross-sectional aspect ratio hinders the numerical convergence of the models
within reasonable delivery times. Thus, aiming to overcome this challenge, we
present a detailed two-dimensional H-model capable to reproduce the
experimentally measured AC-losses of multi-layer power cables made of tens of
2G-HTS tapes. Two cable designs with very high critical currents have been
considered, the first rated at 1.7 kA critical current, consisting of fifty 4
mm width 2G-HTS tapes, these split in 5 concentric layers wound over a
cylindrical former, with the three inner layers forming an arrangement of 24
tapes shielded by two further layers with 13 tapes each. This cable is
contrasted with a size wise equivalent cable with 67 superconducting tapes
rated at 3.2 kA critical current, whose design implies the use of 40 tapes of 3
mm width split within four core layers, and 27 tapes of 4 mm width distributed
in two shielding layers. In both situations a remarkable resemblance between
the simulations and experiments has been found, rendering to acceptable
estimates of the AC-losses for cold dielectric conductors, and offering a
unique view of the local electrodynamics of the wound tapes where the
mechanisms of shielding, magnetization, and transport currents can coexist
within the hysteretic process.

respect to another function $g$ ($g$--subdiffusion equation) to describe a
smooth transition from ordinary subdiffusion to superdiffusion. Ordinary
subdiffusion is described by the equation with the ``ordinary'' fractional
Caputo time derivative, superdiffusion is described by the equation with a
fractional Riesz type spatial derivative. We find the function $g$ for which
the solution (Green's function, GF) to the $g$--subdiffusion equation takes the
form of GF for ordinary subdiffusion in the limit of small time and GF for
superdiffusion in the limit of long time. To solve the $g$--subdiffusion
equation we use the $g$--Laplace transform method. It is shown that the scaling
properties of the GF for $g$--subdiffusion and the GF for superdiffusion are
the same in the long time limit. We conclude that for a sufficiently long time
the $g$--subdiffusion equation describes superdiffusion well, despite a
different stochastic interpretation of the processes. Then, paradoxically, a
subdiffusion equation with a fractional time derivative describes
superdiffusion. The superdiffusive effect is achieved here not by making
anomalously long jumps by a diffusing particle, but by greatly increasing the
particle jump frequency which is derived by means of the $g$--continuous time
random walk model. The $g$--subdiffusion equation is shown to be quite general,
it can be used in modeling of processes in which a kind of diffusion change
continuously over time. In addition, some methods used in modeling of ordinary
subdiffusion processes, such as the derivation of local boundary conditions at
a thin partially permeable membrane, can be used to model $g$--subdiffusion
processes, even if this process is interpreted as superdiffusion.

remains generally impractical due to sample inefficiency. Multi-task RL and
meta-RL aim to improve sample efficiency by generalizing over a distribution of
related tasks. However, doing so is difficult in practice: In multi-task RL,
state of the art methods often fail to outperform a degenerate solution that
simply learns each task separately. Hypernetworks are a promising path forward
since they replicate the separate policies of the degenerate solution while
also allowing for generalization across tasks, and are applicable to meta-RL.
However, evidence from supervised learning suggests hypernetwork performance is
highly sensitive to the initialization. In this paper, we 1) show that
hypernetwork initialization is also a critical factor in meta-RL, and that
naive initializations yield poor performance; 2) propose a novel hypernetwork
initialization scheme that matches or exceeds the performance of a
state-of-the-art approach proposed for supervised settings, as well as being
simpler and more general; and 3) use this method to show that hypernetworks can
improve performance in meta-RL by evaluating on multiple simulated robotics

potential, this is why these models are characterized attractors. As we

This

assess the parameters that govern the seasonal cycle. We define two metrics to
describe the seasonal cycle, $\phi_s$, the latitudinal shift of the maximum
temperature, and $\Delta T$, the maximum seasonal temperature variation
amplitude. We show that alongside the expected dependence on the obliquity and
orbital period, where seasonality generally strengthens with an increase in
these parameters, the seasonality depends in a nontrivial way on the rotation
rate. While the seasonal amplitude decreases as the rotation rate slows down,
the latitudinal shift, $\phi_s$, shifts poleward. A similar result occurs in a
diffusive EBM with increasing diffusivity. These results suggest that the
influence of the rotation rate on the seasonal cycle stems from the effect of
the rotation rate on the atmospheric heat transport.

constraints in how contacts between groups must add up, which prompts us to
call the approach presented here the Bayesian rate consistency model. The model
incorporates computationally efficient Hilbert Space Gaussian process priors to
infer the dynamics in age- and gender-structured social contacts and is
designed to adjust for reporting fatigue in longitudinal surveys. We
demonstrate on simulations the ability to reconstruct contact patterns by

triaxial cables made of up to 135 coated conductors distributed in up to 9
layers. A systematic study is devised, where the number of layers per phase
increases from 1 to 3, with at least 14 tapes distributed across each layer of
the first (innermost) phase, 15 in the secondary (middle) phase, and 16 in the
third (outermost) phase, respectively. Remarkably, our results reveal that the
simple strategy of considering an unbalanced distribution for the amplitudes of
the applied current, can generally balance the magnetic field between the three
phases even for the bilayer and trilayer cables, resulting in negligible
magnetic leaks in all situations. Besides, our simulations allow to see for the
first time how the transport and magnetization currents distribute across the
thickness of all the superconducting tapes, from which we have found that the
AC-losses of the 2nd phase is generally higher than at the other phases at low
to moderate transport currents Itr < 0.8 Ic. Nevertheless, depending on whether
the Ic of the SC tapes at the 3rd phase layers is lower than the one at the 2nd
phase, the layers at the third phase can exhibit a considerable increment on
the AC losses, as result of the considered magneto angular anisotropy of the
HTS tapes, which lead to intriguing electromagnetic features that suggest a
practical threshold for the applied transport current, being it 0.8 Ic.
Likewise, the relative change in the AC-losses per adding layers, per phase,
and as a function of the applied current is disclosed.

similar resources is often explained with mean-field models assuming mixed
populations. In reality, observations of phytoplankton indicate spatial
aggregation at all scales, including at the scale of a few individuals. Local
spatial aggregation can hinder competitive exclusion since individuals then
interact mostly with other individuals of their own species, rather than
competitors from different species. To evaluate how microscale spatial
aggregation might explain phytoplankton diversity maintenance, an
individual-based, multispecies representation of cells in a hydrodynamic
environment is required. We formulate a three-dimensional and multispecies
individual-based model of phytoplankton population dynamics at the Kolmogorov
scale. The model is studied through both simulations and the derivation of
spatial moment equations, in connection with point process theory. The spatial
moment equations show a good match between theory and simulations. We
parameterized the model based on phytoplankters' ecological and physical
characteristics, for both large and small phytoplankton. Defining a zone of
potential interactions as the overlap between nutrient depletion volumes, we
show that local species composition-within the range of possible
interactions-depends on the size class of phytoplankton. In large
phytoplankton, individuals are surrounded by cells from other species, while in
small phytoplankton, individuals remain in mostly monospecific clusters.
Spatial structure therefore favours intra- over inter-specific interactions for
small phytoplankton, which likely contributes to coexistence mechanisms. Other
factors behind diversity maintenance must be examined for large phytoplankton.

battery degradation degree. To account for the influence of battery aging on
the SOC estimation, the battery degradation-related state is incorporated in
the SOC estimation for capacity calibration. The DIICAN method is validated on

different rates. It is of scientific interest to take the data collected by
IBEX and estimate spatial maps of heliospheric ENA rates (referred to as sky
maps) at higher resolutions than before. These sky maps will subsequently be
used to discern between competing theories of heliosphere properties that are
not currently possible. The data IBEX collects present challenges to sky map
estimation. The two primary challenges are noisy and irregularly spaced data
collection and the IBEX instrumentation's point spread function. In essence,
the data collected by IBEX are both noisy and biased for the underlying sky map
of inferential interest. In this paper, we present a two-stage sky map
estimation procedure called Theseus. In Stage 1, Theseus estimates a blurred
sky map from the noisy and irregularly spaced data using an ensemble approach
that leverages projection pursuit regression and generalized additive models.
In Stage 2, Theseus deblurs the sky map by deconvolving the PSF with the
blurred map using regularization. Unblurred sky map uncertainties are computed
via bootstrapping. We compare Theseus to a method closely related to the one
operationally used today by the IBEX Science Operation Center (ISOC) on both
simulated and real data. Theseus outperforms ISOC in nearly every considered

sub-optimal performance. Based on a natural assumption that images belonging to
the same person identity should not match with images belonging to multiple
different person identities across views, called the unicity of person matching
on the identity level, we propose an end-to-end person unicity matching
architecture for learning and refining the person matching relations. First, we
adopt the image samples' contextual information in feature space to generate
the initial soft matching results by using graph neural networks. Secondly, we
utilize the samples' global context relationship to refine the soft matching

full consideration to real-world person re-identification applications, we
achieve the unicity matching in both one-shot and multi-shot settings of person

model to another Bayesian filter has become ubiquitous. Due to the lack of a
structural model that can capture the dependence among different models, the
transfer may not be fully specified. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Bayesian model that accounts for the model-jump from which the object can
choose a model and follow. We aim to track the trajectory of the object while
sequentially transferring from the source object to the target object. The main
idea is to impute the dynamical model while tracking the object and estimating
the state parameters of the moving object according to discretized dynamic
systems. We demonstrate this procedure can handle the model mismatch as it
sequentially corrects the predictive model. Particularly, for a fixed number of
motion models, the object can learn what motion to follow at each time step. We
employ a prior model for each model and then adaptively correct for changing
one model to another to robustly estimate object trajectory under various
motions. More concretely, we propose a robust Bayesian recipe to handle the
model-jump and then integrate it with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
approach to sample from the posterior distribution. We demonstrate through

identifying adversarial drop points, whose removal would significantly impact
the network decision. Generally, methods for identifying adversarial points
rely on the deep model itself in order to determine which points are critically
important for the model's decision. This paper aims to provide a novel
viewpoint on this problem, in which adversarial points can be predicted
independently of the model. To this end, we define 14 point cloud features and
use multiple linear regression to examine whether these features can be used
for model-free adversarial point prediction, and which combination of features
is best suited for this purpose. Experiments show that a suitable combination
of features is able to predict adversarial points of three different networks

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sustaining users' interest and keeping them engaged in the platform is very
important for the success of an e-commerce business. A session encompasses
different activities of a user between logging into the platform and logging
out or making a purchase. User activities in a session can be classified into
two groups: Known Intent and Unknown intent. Known intent activity pertains to
the session where the intent of a user to browse/purchase a specific product
can be easily captured. Whereas in unknown intent activity, the intent of the
user is not known. For example, consider the scenario where a user enters the
session to casually browse the products over the platform, similar to the
window shopping experience in the offline setting. While recommending similar
products is essential in the former, accurately understanding the intent and
recommending interesting products is essential in the latter setting in order
to retain a user. In this work, we focus primarily on the unknown intent
setting where our objective is to recommend a sequence of products to a user in
a session to sustain their interest, keep them engaged and possibly drive them
towards purchase. We formulate this problem in the framework of the Markov
Decision Process (MDP), a popular mathematical framework for sequential
decision making and solve it using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
techniques. However, training the next product recommendation is difficult in
the RL paradigm due to large variance in browse/purchase behavior of the users.
Therefore, we break the problem down into predicting various product
attributes, where a pattern/trend can be identified and exploited to build
accurate models. We show that the DRL agent provides better performance
compared to a greedy strategy.

reaching this ambitious goal is letting the information exchange across

They can enhance knowledge exchange, information management, data
interoperability, and decision support in healthcare systems. They can also be
utilized to create various e-healthcare systems that aid medical practitioners
in making decisions and provide patients with crucial medical information and
automated hospital services. This systematic literature review (SLR) on SW in
healthcare systems aims to assess and critique previous findings while adhering
to appropriate research procedures. We looked at 65 papers and came up with
five themes: e-service, disease, information management, frontier technology,
and regulatory conditions. In each thematic research area, we presented the
contributions of previous literature. We emphasized the topic by responding to
five specific research questions. We have finished the SLR study by identifying
research gaps and establishing future research goals that will help to minimize
the difficulty of adopting SW in healthcare systems and provide new approaches

previously published work. PubMed and EBSCOhost were searched for journal
articles on discrete event simulation in healthcare resulting in identification
of 933 unique articles. Of these about half were excluded at the title/abstract
level and 154 at the full text level, leaving 311 papers to analyze. These were
categorized, then analyzed by category and collectively to identify publication
volume over time, disease focus, activity levels by coun-try, software systems
used, and sizes of healthcare unit under study. A total of 1196 articles were
initially identified. This list was narrowed down to 311 for systematic review.
Following the schema from prior systematic reviews, the articles fell into four
broad categories: health care sys-tems operations (HCSO), disease progression
modeling (DPM), screening modeling (SM), and health behavior modeling (HBM). We
found that discrete event simulation in healthcare has con-tinued to increase
year-over-year, as well as expand into diverse areas of the healthcare system.
In addition, this study adds extra bibliometric dimensions to gain more insight
into the details and nuances of how and where simulation is being used in
healthcare.

pedestrians (especially children) crossing the street. A common philosophy of
existing pedestrian detection approaches is that this task should be undertaken
by the moving cars themselves. In sharp departure from this philosophy, we
propose to enlist the help of cars parked along the sidewalk to detect and
protect crossing pedestrians. In support of this goal, we propose ADOPT: a
system for Alerting Drivers to Occluded Pedestrian Traffic. ADOPT lays the
theoretical foundations of a system that uses parked cars to: (1) detect the
presence of a group of crossing pedestrians - a crossing cohort; (2) predict
the time the last member of the cohort takes to clear the street; (3) send
alert messages to those approaching cars that may reach the crossing area while
pedestrians are still in the street; and, (4) show how approaching cars can
adjust their speed, given several simultaneous crossing locations. Importantly,
in ADOPT all communications occur over very short distances and at very low
power. Our extensive simulations using SUMO-generated pedestrian and car
traffic have shown the effectiveness of ADOPT in detecting and protecting
crossing pedestrians.

developed turbulence statistics in so far that velocities and vorticities
become highly anisotropic as they approach it. While the vorticity anisotropy
layer scales in wall units, the velocity one is found to scale ith outer flow
units and exhibits much larger extension. Furthermore the influence of the free

spectral statistics. It is found that the spanwise extension increases by a

gatherings, which seriously affects the efficiency of traffic and reduces the
flow of pedestrians. Some studies have shown that setting devices in front of
bottlenecks can promote pedestrian evacuation under certain conditions. In this
paper, the effect of setting diversion devices in front of the exit on
pedestrian flow is studied. From our observation, these diversion devices can
form a buffer zone before the exit and affect pedestrian behaviors. The
evacuation times are found to decrease as the devices became farther away from
the exit. In our experiments, it is found that the effect of shunt piles on
evacuation is better than in the case of safety barriers and without device
conditions. Under the condition of setting up safety barriers approximately 1m
and 3m in front of the exit, the evacuation times are extended by 0.88% and
2.67%. For shunt piles, the evacuation times are 11.53% and 14.96% shorter than
that of those without a device regarding the different distances to exit (1m
and 3m, respectively). In addition, setting up shunt piles reduces the time
interval between two consecutive pedestrians. To sum up, in our experimental
settings, the diversion devices can effectively improve the average speed ahead
of the exit and promote evacuation to become more orderly, which reduces the
congestion in the later period of evacuation. In other words, this study
demonstrates that a reasonable layout of facilities can not only meet the daily
functional requirements but also improve the efficient use of space in
emergencies, reducing the probability of crowd conventions and jams.

future fifth-generation (5G) systems. Reduced pilot contamination (PC) enhanced
system performance, and reduced inter-cell interference and improved channel
estimation. However, because the pilot sequence transmitted by users in a
single cell to neighboring cells is not orthogonal, massive MIMO systems are
still constrained. We propose channel evaluation using orthogonal pilot reuse
sequences (PRS) and zero forced (ZF) pre-coding techniques to eliminate channel
quality in end users with poor channel quality based on channel evaluation,
large-scale shutdown evaluation, and analysis of maximum transmission
efficiency. We derived the lower bounds on the downlink data rate (DR) and
signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) that can be achieved based on PRS
assignment to a group of users where the number of antenna elements mitigated
the interference when the number of antennas reaches infinity. The channel
coherence interval limitation, the orthogonal PRS cannot be allocated to all
UEs in each cell. The short coherence intervals able to reduce the PC and
improve the quality of channel. The results of the modelling showed that higher
DR can be achieved due to better channel evaluation and lower loss.

understand activated processes in complex systems such as proteins. The default
assumption from Kramers physical intuition is that of a diffusion process.
However, the dynamics of barrier-crossing in natural complex molecules are
largely unexplored. Here we investigate the transition dynamics of
alanine-dipeptide isomerization, the simplest complex system with a large
number of non-reaction coordinates that can serve as an adequate thermal bath
feeding energy into the reaction coordinates. We separate conformations along
the time axis and construct the dynamic probability surface of reaction. We
quantify its topological structure and rotational flux using persistent
homology and differential form. Our results uncovered a region with strong
reactive vortex in the configuration-time space, where the highest probability
peak and the transition state ensemble are located. This reactive region
contains strong rotational fluxes: Most reactive trajectories swirl multiple
times around this region in the subspace of the two most-important reaction
coordinates. Furthermore, the rotational fluxes result from cooperative
movement along the isocommitter surfaces and orthogonal barrier-crossing.
Overall, our findings offer a first glimpse into the reactive vortex regions
that characterize the non-diffusive dynamics of barrier-crossing of a naturally
occurring activation process.
