However, our theoretical understanding of the remnant properties of such

current single-view COD detectors are sensitive to background distractors.
Therefore, blurred boundaries and variable shapes of the camouflaged objects
are challenging to be fully captured with a single-view detector. To overcome
these obstacles, we propose a behavior-inspired framework, called Multi-view
Feature Fusion Network (MFFN), which mimics the human behaviors of finding
indistinct objects in images, i.e., observing from multiple angles, distances,
perspectives. Specifically, the key idea behind it is to generate multiple ways
of observation (multi-view) by data augmentation and apply them as inputs. MFFN
captures critical boundary and semantic information by comparing and fusing
extracted multi-view features. In addition, our MFFN exploits the dependence
and interaction between views and channels. Specifically, our methods leverage
the complementary information between different views through a two-stage
attention module called Co-attention of Multi-view (CAMV). And we design a
local-overall module called Channel Fusion Unit (CFU) to explore the
channel-wise contextual clues of diverse feature maps in an iterative manner.
The experiment results show that our method performs favorably against existing

ABC stacking with competing intralayer and interlayers couplings. By combining
the nematic bond theory and the self-consistent Gaussian approximation, we
establish the phase diagram for this ABC-stacked multilayer magnet. It is shown
that, the system supports a wide regime of spiral spin liquid with multiple
degenerate spiral lines in the reciprocal space, separating the low-temperature
spiral order and the high-temperature featureless paramagnet. The transition to
the spiral order from the spiral spin liquid regime is first order. We further

perturbations such as further neighbor intralayer exchanges. The connection to
the ABC-stacked magnets, the effects of Ising or planar spin anisotropy, and
the outlook on the stacking-engineered quantum magnets are discussed.

multi-resolution functional maps with spectral attention. Existing functional
map learning methods all rely on the critical choice of the spectral resolution
hyperparameter, which can severely affect the overall accuracy or lead to
overfitting, if not chosen carefully. In this paper, we show that spectral
resolution tuning can be alleviated by introducing spectral attention. Our
framework is applicable in both supervised and unsupervised settings, and we
show that it is possible to train the network so that it can adapt the spectral
resolution, depending on the given shape input. More specifically, we propose
to compute multi-resolution functional maps that characterize correspondence
across a range of spectral resolutions, and introduce a spectral attention
network that helps to combine this representation into a single coherent final
correspondence. Our approach is not only accurate with near-isometric input,
for which a high spectral resolution is typically preferred, but also robust
and able to produce reasonable matching even in the presence of significant
non-isometric distortion, which poses great challenges to existing methods. We
demonstrate the superior performance of our approach through experiments on a
suite of challenging near-isometric and non-isometric shape matching
benchmarks.

adding to a line of work that dates back to Hyafil and Rivest in 1976. We
prove, under randomized ETH, superpolynomial lower bounds for two basic
problems: given an explicit representation of a function $f$ and a generator
for a distribution $\mathcal{D}$, construct a small decision tree approximator
for $f$ under $\mathcal{D}$, and decide if there is a small decision tree
approximator for $f$ under $\mathcal{D}$.
  Our results imply new lower bounds for distribution-free PAC learning and
testing of decision trees, settings in which the algorithm only has restricted
access to $f$ and $\mathcal{D}$. Specifically, we show: $n$-variable size-$s$
decision trees cannot be properly PAC learned in time $n^{\tilde{O}(\log\log
s)}$, and depth-$d$ decision trees cannot be tested in time $\exp(d^{\,O(1)})$.
For learning, the previous best lower bound only ruled out
$\text{poly}(n)$-time algorithms (Alekhnovich, Braverman, Feldman, Klivans, and
Pitassi, 2009). For testing, recent work gives similar though incomparable
bounds in the setting where $f$ is random and $\mathcal{D}$ is nonexplicit
(Blais, Ferreira Pinto Jr., and Harms, 2021). Assuming a plausible conjecture
on the hardness of Set-Cover, we show our lower bound for learning decision
trees can be improved to $n^{\Omega(\log s)}$, matching the best known upper
bound of $n^{O(\log s)}$ due to Ehrenfeucht and Haussler (1989).
  We obtain our results within a unified framework that leverages recent
progress in two lines of work: the inapproximability of Set-Cover and XOR
lemmas for query complexity. Our framework is versatile and yields results for
related concept classes such as juntas and DNF formulas.

improvements on Question Answering tasks designed to require commonsense
knowledge. However, fine-tuning large Language Models (LMs) on these specific
tasks does not directly evaluate commonsense learned during pre-training. The
most direct assessments of commonsense knowledge in pre-trained LMs are
arguably cloze-style tasks targeting commonsense assertions (e.g., A pen is
used for [MASK].). However, this approach is restricted by the LM's vocabulary
available for masked predictions, and its precision is subject to the context
provided by the assertion. In this work, we present a method for enriching LMs
with a grounded sense inventory (i.e., WordNet) available at the vocabulary
level, without further training. This modification augments the prediction
space of cloze-style prompts to the size of a large ontology while enabling
finer-grained (sense-level) queries and predictions. In order to evaluate LMs
with higher precision, we propose SenseLAMA, a cloze-style task featuring
verbalized relations from disambiguated triples sourced from WordNet, WikiData,

Solutions based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become increasingly

function designs to tackle two critical issues in DRL-based navigation
solutions: 1) smoothness of the trained flight trajectories; and 2) model
generalization to handle unseen environments.
  Formulated under a DRL framework, our model relies on margin reward and
smoothness constraints to ensure UAVs fly smoothly while greatly reducing the
chance of collision. The proposed smoothness reward minimizes a combination of
first-order and second-order derivatives of flight trajectories, which can also
drive the points to be evenly distributed, leading to stable flight speed. To
enhance the agent's capability of handling new unseen environments, two
practical setups are proposed to improve the invariance of both the state and
reward function when deploying in different scenes. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our overall design and individual components.

two mechanisms, namely: (i) a privacy budget amplification via Poisson
sub-sampling to train a target prediction model that requires less noise to
achieve a same level of privacy budget, and (ii) a combination of the
sub-sampling technique and an ensemble teacher-student learning framework that
introduces DP-preserving noise at the output of the teacher models and
transfers DP-preserving properties via noisy labels. Privacy-preserving student
models are then trained with the noisy labels to learn the knowledge with
DP-protection from the teacher model ensemble. Experimental evidences on spoken

that our proposed framework greatly outperforms existing DP-preserving

data cubes from raw SPHERE integral-field spectrograph (IFS) data. The pipeline
is written in Python and based on the pipeline that was developed for the
CHARIS IFS. It introduces several improvements to SPHERE data analysis that
ultimately produce significant improvements in postprocessing sensitivity. We
first used new data to measure SPHERE lenslet point spread functions (PSFs) at
the four laser calibration wavelengths. These lenslet PSFs enabled us to
forward-model SPHERE data, to extract spectra using a least-squares fit, and to
remove spectral crosstalk using the measured lenslet PSFs. Our approach also
reduces the number of required interpolations, both spectral and spatial, and
can preserve the original hexagonal lenslet geometry in the SPHERE IFS. In the
case of least-squares extraction, no interpolation of the data is performed. We
demonstrate this new pipeline on the directly imaged exoplanet 51 Eri b and on
observations of the hot white dwarf companion to HD 2133. The extracted
spectrum of HD 2133B matches theoretical models, demonstrating
spectrophotometric calibration that is good to a few percent. Postprocessing on
two 51 Eri b data sets demonstrates a median improvement in sensitivity of 80%
and 30% for the 2015 and 2017 data, respectively, compared to the use of cubes
reconstructed by the SPHERE Data Center. The largest improvements are seen for
poorer observing conditions. The new SPHERE pipeline takes less than three
minutes to produce a data cube on a modern laptop, making it practical to
reprocess all SPHERE IFS data.

uncertainty estimations, various post-hoc calibration methods have been
developed for neural networks on standard multi-class classification tasks.
However, these methods are not well suited for calibrating graph neural
networks (GNNs), which presents unique challenges such as accounting for the
graph structure and the graph-induced correlations between the nodes. In this
work, we conduct a systematic study on the calibration qualities of GNN node
predictions. In particular, we identify five factors which influence the
calibration of GNNs: general under-confident tendency, diversity of nodewise
predictive distributions, distance to training nodes, relative confidence
level, and neighborhood similarity. Furthermore, based on the insights from
this study, we design a novel calibration method named Graph Attention
Temperature Scaling (GATS), which is tailored for calibrating graph neural
networks. GATS incorporates designs that address all the identified influential
factors and produces nodewise temperature scaling using an attention-based
architecture. GATS is accuracy-preserving, data-efficient, and expressive at
the same time. Our experiments empirically verify the effectiveness of GATS,
demonstrating that it can consistently achieve state-of-the-art calibration
results on various graph datasets for different GNN backbones.

(weighted) count of all walks starting at each node, with an additional damping
factor of $\alpha$ that tunes the influence of walks as lengths increase. We
introduce a tool to compare different centrality measures in terms of their
node rankings, which takes into account that a relative ranking of two nodes by
a centrality measure is unreliable if their scores are within a margin of error
of one another. We employ this tool to understand the effect of the
$\alpha$-parameter on the lengths of walks that significantly affect the
ranking of nodes. In particular, we find an upper bound on the lengths of the
walks that determine the node ranking up to this margin of error. If an
application imposes a realistic bound on possible walk lengths, this set of
tools may be helpful to determine a suitable value for $\alpha$. We show the
effect of $\alpha$ on rankings when applied to the Susceptibility Inference

part of IoT systems. The primary functionality of a WSN is gathering data from
specific points that are covered with sensor nodes and transmitting the
collected data to remote units for further processing. In IoT use cases, a WSN
infrastructure may need to be shared by many applications, which requires
scheduling those applications to time-share the node and network resources. In
this paper, we investigate the problem of application scheduling in WSN

monitoring points to be sensed in the region a WSN spans and propose a
shared-data approach utilizing multiplexed sensing of monitoring points
requested by multiple applications, which reduces sensing and communication
load on the network. We also propose a genetic algorithm called GABAS, and
three greedy algorithms for scheduling applications onto a WSN infrastructure
considering different criteria. We performed extensive simulation experiments
to evaluate our algorithms and compare them to some standard scheduling
methods. The results show that our proposed methods perform much better than
the standard scheduling methods in terms of makespan, turnaround time, waiting

space disentanglement, cycle-consistency losses, prototype editing etc. The
prototype editing approach, which is known to be quite successful in TST,
involves two key phases a) Masking of source style-associated tokens and b)
Reconstruction of this source-style masked sentence conditioned with the target
style. We follow a similar transduction method, in which we transpose the more
difficult direct source to target TST task to a simpler Style-Masked Language
Model (SMLM) Task, wherein, similar to BERT \cite{bert}, the goal of our model
is now to reconstruct the source sentence from its style-masked version. We
arrive at the SMLM mechanism naturally by formulating prototype editing/
transduction methods in a probabilistic framework, where TST resolves into
estimating a hypothetical parallel dataset from a partially observed parallel
dataset, wherein each domain is assumed to have a common latent style-masked
prior. To generate this style-masked prior, we use ""Explainable Attention"" as
our choice of attribution for a more precise style-masking step and also
introduce a cost-effective and accurate ""Attribution-Surplus"" method of
determining the position of masks from any arbitrary attribution model in O(1)
time. We empirically show that this non-generational approach well suites the
""content preserving"" criteria for a task like TST, even for a complex style
like Discourse Manipulation. Our model, the Style MLM, outperforms strong TST
baselines and is on par with state-of-the-art TST models, which use complex

we benchmark the requirements for the high-precision measurement of

luminosity distance and redshift. We focus on $\Lambda$CDM and scalar-tensor
cosmologies, using the Effective Field Theory formalism as a unifying language.
We find that, in some of the explored setups, GW-WL contributes to the galaxy
signal by doubling the accuracy on non-$\Lambda$CDM parameters, allowing in the
most favourable scenarios to reach even percent and sub-percent level bounds.
Though the most extreme cases presented here are likely beyond the
observational capabilities of currently planned individual GW detectors, we
show nonetheless that - provided that enough statistics of events can be
accumulated - GW-WL offers the potential to become a cosmological probe
complementary to LSS surveys, particularly for those parameters that cannot be
constrained by other GW probes such as standard sirens.

continual learning (OCL) aims to adapt efficiently to new data while retaining
existing knowledge. The typical approach to address information retention (the
ability to retain previous knowledge) is keeping a replay buffer of a fixed
size and computing gradients using a mixture of new data and the replay buffer.
Surprisingly, the recent work (Cai et al., 2021) suggests that information
retention remains a problem in large scale OCL even when the replay buffer is
unlimited, i.e., the gradients are computed using all past data. This paper
focuses on this peculiarity to understand and address information retention. To
pinpoint the source of this problem, we theoretically show that, given limited
computation budgets at each time step, even without strict storage limit,
naively applying SGD with constant or constantly decreasing learning rates
fails to optimize information retention in the long term. We propose using a
moving average family of methods to improve optimization for non-stationary
objectives. Specifically, we design an adaptive moving average (AMA) optimizer
and a moving-average-based learning rate schedule (MALR). We demonstrate the
effectiveness of AMA+MALR on large-scale benchmarks, including Continual

necessarily have to occur simultaneously in order to accomplish successful
leptogenesis. Instead, it suffices if new CP-violating interactions at high
energies result in primordial charge asymmetries, which are then reprocessed
into a nonvanishing B-L asymmetry by right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) at lower
energies. In this paper, we study this novel mechanism known as ""wash-in
leptogenesis"", utilizing axion inflation as the source of high-scale CP
violation. We specifically consider axion inflation coupled to the Standard
Model hypercharge sector, which results in the dual production of hypermagnetic
helicity and fermionic charge asymmetries. Although the survival of these
charges is endangered by sphaleron processes, magnetic diffusion, and the
chiral plasma instability, we find a large range of viable scenarios. We
consistently account for RHN flavor effects and coherence among the Standard
Model lepton flavors across a wide range of RHN masses. We find a lower bound
of 10^(5...9) GeV on the mass of the lightest RHN involved in wash-in
leptogenesis, depending on the onset of turbulence in the chiral plasma and the
Hubble scale of inflation. Our model is representative of a broader class of
new leptogenesis scenarios and suggests interesting observational signatures
with regard to intergalactic magnetic fields, primordial black holes, and
gravitational waves.

supports end-to-end visual unfairness diagnosis for graph embeddings. The tool
is the product of a design study in collaboration with domain experts. It
allows the user to (i) visually compare two embeddings with respect to
fairness, (ii) locate nodes or graph communities that are unfairly embedded,

feature is imprinted on the well known bimodal colour distribution of these

based on photometry from the HST Advanced Camera Virgo Survey, in less massive
Virgo galaxies. This characteristic can be traced up to to 45 arcmin (217 Kpc)
in galactocentric radius. This suggests that globular cluster formation in
Virgo has been regulated, at least partially, by a collective process composed
by several discrete events, working on spatial scales comparable to the size of
the galaxy cluster. Furthermore, the presence of a similar colour pattern in
NGC 5128, at the outskirsts of the Virgo Super-cluster, poses an intriguing
question about the spatial scale of the phenomenon. The nature of the process

connected with galaxy or sub-galaxy cluster mergers and SMBH activity, in the

works have shown it extremely challenging to unlearn the undesired backdoor
behavior from the network, since the entire network can be affected by the
backdoor samples. In this paper, we propose a brand-new backdoor defense
strategy, which makes it much easier to remove the harmful influence of
backdoor samples from the model. Our defense strategy, \emph{Trap and Replace},
consists of two stages. In the first stage, we bait and trap the backdoors in a
small and easy-to-replace subnetwork. Specifically, we add an auxiliary image
reconstruction head on top of the stem network shared with a light-weighted
classification head. The intuition is that the auxiliary image reconstruction
task encourages the stem network to keep sufficient low-level visual features
that are hard to learn but semantically correct, instead of overfitting to the
easy-to-learn but semantically incorrect backdoor correlations. As a result,
when trained on backdoored datasets, the backdoors are easily baited towards
the unprotected classification head, since it is much more vulnerable than the
shared stem, leaving the stem network hardly poisoned. In the second stage, we
replace the poisoned light-weighted classification head with an untainted one,
by re-training it from scratch only on a small holdout dataset with clean
samples, while fixing the stem network. As a result, both the stem and the
classification head in the final network are hardly affected by backdoor
training samples. We evaluate our method against ten different backdoor
attacks. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by up to
$20.57\%$, $9.80\%$, and $13.72\%$ attack success rate and on-average $3.14\%$,
$1.80\%$, and $1.21\%$ clean classification accuracy on CIFAR10, GTSRB, and

share their data with anyone, XCLP employs two cryptographically secure

combinatorial generalization of deep ensemble called deep combinatorial

And we discovered that coarse-grain DCAs can outperform deep ensemble for

task-oriented dialog systems. While advanced FSIC methods are similar in using
pretrained language models to encode texts and nearest neighbour-based
inference for classification, these methods differ in details. They start from
different pretrained text encoders, use different encoding architectures with
varying similarity functions, and adopt different training regimes. Coupling
these mostly independent design decisions and the lack of accompanying ablation
studies are big obstacle to identify the factors that drive the reported FSIC
performance. We study these details across three key dimensions: (1) Encoding
architectures: Cross-Encoder vs Bi-Encoders; (2) Similarity function:
Parameterized (i.e., trainable) functions vs non-parameterized function; (3)
Training regimes: Episodic meta-learning vs the straightforward (i.e.,
non-episodic) training. Our experimental results on seven FSIC benchmarks
reveal three important findings. First, the unexplored combination of the
cross-encoder architecture (with parameterized similarity scoring function) and
episodic meta-learning consistently yields the best FSIC performance. Second,
Episodic training yields a more robust FSIC classifier than non-episodic one.
Third, in meta-learning methods, splitting an episode to support and query sets
is not a must. Our findings paves the way for conducting state-of-the-art
research in FSIC and more importantly raise the community's attention to

cannot yet perform reliable deductive reasoning, demonstrating the importance
of controlled examinations and probing of PLMs' reasoning abilities; we reach
beyond (misleading) task performance, revealing that PLMs are still far from

any realizable pair correlation function $g_2({\bf r})$ or structure factor
$S({\bf k})$ of a translationally invariant nonequilibrium system can be
attained by an equilibrium ensemble involving only (up to) effective two-body
interactions. To test this conjecture, we consider two singular nonequilibrium
models of recent interest that also have the exotic hyperuniformity property: a
2D ""perfect glass"" and a 3D critical absorbing-state model. We find that each
nonequilibrium target can be achieved accurately by equilibrium states with
effective one- and two-body potentials, lending further support to the
conjecture. To characterize the structural degeneracy of such
nonequilibrium-equilibrium correspondence, we compute higher-order statistics
for both models, as well as those for a hyperuniform 3D uniformly randomized
lattice (URL), whose higher-order statistics can be very precisely ascertained.
Interestingly, we find that the differences in the higher-order statistics
between nonequilibrium and equilibrium systems with matching pair statistics,
as measured by the ""hole"" probability distribution, provides measures of the
degree to which a system is out of equilibrium. We show that all three systems
studied possess the \textit{bounded-hole} property, and that holes near the
maximum hole size in the URL are much rarer than those in the underlying simple
cubic lattice. Remarkably, upon quenching, the effective potentials for all
three systems possess local energy minima with stronger forms of
hyperuniformity compared to their target counterparts. Our work is expected to
facilitate the self-assembly of tunable hyperuniform soft-matter systems.

typically designed for unconstrained domains. However, constraints are
ubiquitous in machine learning problems, such as those on safety, fairness,
robustness, and many other properties that must be satisfied to apply sampling
results in real-life applications. Enforcing these constraints often leads to
implicitly-defined manifolds, making efficient sampling with constraints very
challenging. In this paper, we propose a new variational framework with a
designed orthogonal-space gradient flow (O-Gradient) for sampling on a manifold
$\mathcal{G}_0$ defined by general equality constraints. O-Gradient decomposes
the gradient into two parts: one decreases the distance to $\mathcal{G}_0$ and
the other decreases the KL divergence in the orthogonal space. While most
existing manifold sampling methods require initialization on $\mathcal{G}_0$,
O-Gradient does not require such prior knowledge. We prove that O-Gradient
converges to the target constrained distribution with rate
$\widetilde{O}(1/\text{the number of iterations})$ under mild conditions. Our
proof relies on a new Stein characterization of conditional measure which could
be of independent interest. We implement O-Gradient through both Langevin
dynamics and Stein variational gradient descent and demonstrate its
effectiveness in various experiments, including Bayesian deep neural networks.

observed that pre-trained models trained on less in-distribution data have
better out-of-distribution performance. However, it is unclear how broadly
these trends hold. We conduct a large empirical study across three tasks, three
broadly-applicable modeling interventions (increasing model size, using a
different adaptation method, and pre-training on more data), and 14 diverse
datasets to investigate the relationship between sample efficiency (amount of
data needed to reach a given ID accuracy) and robustness (how models fare on
OOD evaluation). We find that higher sample efficiency is only correlated with
better average OOD robustness on some modeling interventions and tasks, but not
others. On individual datasets, models with lower sample efficiency can even be
more robust. These results suggest that general-purpose methods for improving
sample efficiency are unlikely to yield universal OOD robustness improvements,
since such improvements are highly dataset- and task-dependent. Even in an era
of large, multi-purpose pretrained models, task-specific decisions may often be
necessary for OOD generalization.

(students) with the supervision of large and strong models (teachers). As
empirically there exists a strong correlation between the performance of
teacher and student models, it is commonly believed that a high performing
teacher is preferred. Consequently, practitioners tend to use a well trained
network or an ensemble of them as the teacher. In this paper, we make an
intriguing observation that an intermediate model, i.e., a checkpoint in the
middle of the training procedure, often serves as a better teacher compared to
the fully converged model, although the former has much lower accuracy. More
surprisingly, a weak snapshot ensemble of several intermediate models from a
same training trajectory can outperform a strong ensemble of independently
trained and fully converged models, when they are used as teachers. We show
that this phenomenon can be partially explained by the information bottleneck
principle: the feature representations of intermediate models can have higher
mutual information regarding the input, and thus contain more ""dark knowledge""
for effective distillation. We further propose an optimal intermediate teacher
selection algorithm based on maximizing the total task-related mutual
information. Experiments verify its effectiveness and applicability.

Therefore, it is unclear how well Smatch (still) relates to human estimates of

  We conduct an analysis of two popular and strong AMR parsers that --

how human quality ratings relate to Smatch and other AMR metrics. Our main
findings are: i) While high Smatch scores indicate otherwise, we find that AMR
parsing is far from being solved: we frequently find structurally small, but
semantically unacceptable errors that substantially distort sentence meaning.
ii) Considering high-performance parsers, better Smatch scores may not
necessarily indicate consistently better parsing quality. To obtain a

generation and animation, they often suffer from undesirable artifacts such as
3D inconsistency when rendering images from different camera viewpoints. This
prevents them from synthesizing video animations indistinguishable from real
ones. Recently, 3D-aware GANs extend 2D GANs for explicit disentanglement of
camera pose by leveraging 3D scene representations. These methods can well
preserve the 3D consistency of the generated images across different views, yet
they cannot achieve fine-grained control over other attributes, among which
facial expression control is arguably the most useful and desirable for face
animation. In this paper, we propose an animatable 3D-aware GAN for multiview
consistent face animation generation. The key idea is to decompose the 3D
representation of the 3D-aware GAN into a template field and a deformation
field, where the former represents different identities with a canonical
expression, and the latter characterizes expression variations of each
identity. To achieve meaningful control over facial expressions via
deformation, we propose a 3D-level imitative learning scheme between the
generator and a parametric 3D face model during adversarial training of the
3D-aware GAN. This helps our method achieve high-quality animatable face image
generation with strong visual 3D consistency, even though trained with only

a result, we find that spin-precession instruments are much more sensitive than

sensitivity improvement of up to a factor of 100 at an axion mass of 100 neV

mid-infrared wavelengths, leading to substantial redshift-dependent color
variations in broad-band photometry. The advent of JWST for the first time
allows the study of this effect for normal SFGs. Based on spectral energy

based on estimating gradients of the cost function. Due to the statistical
nature of quantum measurements, this estimation requires many circuit

new gradient estimation method to mitigate this measurement challenge and
reduce the required measurement rounds. Within a Bayesian framework and based
on the generalized parameter shift rule, we use prior information about the
circuit to find an estimation strategy that minimizes expected statistical and
systematic errors simultaneously. We demonstrate that this approach can
significantly outperform traditional gradient estimation methods, reducing the
required measurement rounds by up to an order of magnitude for a common QAOA
setup. Our analysis also shows that an estimation via finite differences can
outperform the parameter shift rule in terms of gradient accuracy for small and
moderate measurement budgets.

mystery of NGC 2915, we performed a comprehensive analysis of deep VLT/MUSE
integral field spectroscopic observations that cover the star-forming region in
the central kiloparsec of the galaxy. We find that episodes of bursty star
formation have recurred in different locations throughout the central region,
and the most recent one peaked around 50 Myr ago. The bursty star formation has
significantly disturbed the kinematics of the ionized gas but not the neutral
atomic gas, which implies that the two gas phases are largely spatially
decoupled along the line of sight. No evidence for an active galactic nucleus
is found based on the classical line-ratio diagnostic diagrams. The ionized gas
metallicities have a positive radial gradient, which confirms the previous
study based on several individual H ii regions and may be attributed to both
the stellar feedback-driven outflows and metal-poor gas inflow. Evidence for
metal-poor gas infall or inflow includes discoveries of high-speed collisions
between gas clouds of different metallicities, localized gas metallicity drops
and unusually small metallicity differences between gas and stars. The central
stellar disk appears to be counter-rotating with respect to the extended H i
disk, implying that the recent episodes of bursty star formation have been
sustained by externally accreted gas.

the growing class of tidally influenced pulsators. Initial analysis of U Gru
revealed frequencies spaced by the orbital frequency that are difficult to
explain by currently proposed tidal mechanisms. Methods. We re-investigate the
TESS photometry of U Gru alongside new uves spectroscopy. We analyse the uves
spectroscopy with least-squares deconvolution and spectral disentangling
techniques, and perform an atmospheric analysis. We remove the binary signature
from the light curve using an effective model in order to investigate the
pulsation signal in the residuals. We track the amplitudes and phases of the
residual pulsations as a function of the orbital period to reveal their tidal
influence. Results. We establish that U Gru is likely a hierarchical triple
system. We identify a single p mode oscillation to exhibit amplitude and phase
variation over the binary orbit. We propose a toy model to demonstrate that the
series of frequencies separated by the orbital frequency can be reproduced by
eclipse mapping. We find no evidence of modulation to the other independent
oscillation modes. Conclusions. We demonstrate that U Gru hosts at least one
tidally perturbed pulsation. Additionally we argue that eclipse mapping of the
dominant, tidally perturbed mode can produce the series of frequencies
separated by the observed orbital frequency. Our simulations show that the
effects of eclipse mapping are mode dependent, and are not expected to produce
an observable signature for all pulsation modes in an eclipse binary.

galaxy formation. While there has been a plethora of work on `wind tunnel'
simulations that study such cold gas in winds, the infall of this gas under
gravity is at least equally important, and fundamentally different since cold
gas can never entrain. Instead, velocity shear increases and remains
unrelenting. If these clouds are growing, they can experience a drag force due
to the accretion of low momentum gas, which dominates over ram pressure drag.
This leads to sub-virial terminal velocities, in line with observations. We
develop simple analytic theory and predictions based on turbulent radiative
mixing layers. We test these scalings in 3D hydrodynamic simulations, both for
an artificial constant background, as well as a more realistic stratified
background. We find that the survival criterion for infalling gas is more
stringent than in a wind, requiring that clouds grow faster than they are
destroyed ($t_{\rm grow} < 4\,t_{\rm cc} $). This can be translated to a
critical pressure, which for Milky Way like conditions is $P \sim 3000 {\rm
k}_B {\rm K}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$ . Cold gas which forms via linear thermal
instability ($t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff} < 1$) in planar geometry meets the
survival threshold. In stratified environments, larger clouds need only survive
infall until cooling becomes effective. We discuss applications to high
velocity clouds and filaments in galaxy clusters.

IIb SN, the explosion of a yellow supergiant, and its infrared spectral energy

segmentation in a fully supervised way is expensive, various approaches have
been proposed to train action segmentation models using different forms of weak
supervision, e.g., action transcripts, action sets, or more recently
timestamps. Timestamp supervision is a promising type of weak supervision as
obtaining one timestamp per action is less expensive than annotating all
frames, but it provides more information than other forms of weak supervision.
However, previous works assume that every action instance is annotated with a
timestamp, which is a restrictive assumption since it assumes that annotators
do not miss any action. In this work, we relax this restrictive assumption and
take missing annotations for some action instances into account. We show that
our approach is more robust to missing annotations compared to other approaches

Galactic surveys and dense cadence Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-based surveys
are overcoming these limitations, leading to sharply increased nova-in-galaxy
rates relative to those previously claimed. Here we present 14 nova candidates
that were serendipitously observed during a year-long HST survey of the massive
spiral galaxy M51 (the ""Whirlpool Galaxy""). We use simulations based on
observed nova light curves to model the incompleteness of the HST survey in
unprecedented detail, determining a nova detection efficiency $\epsilon = 20.3$
percent. The survey's M51 area coverage, combined with $\epsilon$, indicates a
conservative M51 nova rate of $172^{+46}_{-37}$ novae yr$^{-1}$, corresponding
to a luminosity-specific nova rate (LSNR) of $\sim10.4^{+2.8}_{-2.2}$ novae
yr$^{-1}$/$10^{10} L_{\odot,K}$. Both these rates are approximately an order of
magnitude higher than those estimated by ground-based studies, contradicting
claims of universal low nova rates in all types of galaxies determined by low

as they must be surrounded by large ionized bubbles in order to be visible
during the reionization era. Large ionized regions are thought to correspond to
over-dense regions and may be protoclusters, making them interesting test-beds
for early massive structures. Close associations containing several LAEs are
often assumed to mark over-dense, ionized bubbles. Here, we develop the first
framework to quantify the ionization and density fields of high-z galaxy
associations. We explore the interplay between (i) the large-scale density of a
survey field, (ii) Poisson noise due to the small number density of bright
sources at high redshifts (z~7), and (iii) the effects of the ionized fraction
on the observation of LAEs. We use Bayesian statistics, a simple model of
reionization, and a Monte-Carlo simulation to construct a more comprehensive
method for calculating the large-scale density of LAE regions than previous
works. We find that Poisson noise has a strong effect on the inferred density
of a region and show how the ionized fraction can be inferred. We then apply
our framework to the strongest association yet identified: Hu et al. (2021)
found 14 LAEs in a volume of ~50,000 cMpc^3 inside the COSMOS field at z~7. We
show that this is most likely a 2.5-sigma over-density inside of an ionized or
nearly ionized bubble. We also show that this LAE association implies that the
global ionized fraction is Q = 0.60 (+0.08,-0.09), within the context of a
simple reionization model.

sensitive to strain-induced distortions in the moir\'e superlattice.

used in quantum computing and metrology apparently evade this transition,
displaying superconducting behavior deep into the nominally insulating regime.
The absence of critical behavior in such devices is not well understood. Here
we show that, unlike the typical quantum-critical broadening scenario, in
Josephson arrays temperature dramatically shifts the critical region. This
shift leads to a regime of superconductivity at high temperature, arising from
the melted zero-temperature insulator. Our results quantitatively explain the
low-temperature onset of superconductivity in nominally insulating regimes, and
the transition to the strongly insulating phase. We further present, to our

answers to these questions can be found through an in-depth understanding of
the relations between the primary task that a benign model is supposed to
accomplish and the backdoor task that a backdoored model actually performs. For
this purpose, we leverage similarity metrics in multi-task learning to formally
define the backdoor distance (similarity) between the primary task and the
backdoor task, and analyze existing stealthy backdoor attacks, revealing that
most of them fail to effectively reduce the backdoor distance and even for
those that do, still much room is left to further improve their stealthiness.
So we further design a new method, called TSA attack, to automatically generate
a backdoor model under a given distance constraint, and demonstrate that our
new attack indeed outperforms existing attacks, making a step closer to
understanding the attacker's limits. Most importantly, we provide both
theoretic results and experimental evidence on various datasets for the
positive correlation between the backdoor distance and backdoor detectability,
demonstrating that indeed our task similarity analysis help us better

generalization guarantees in terms of algorithmic stability, VC dimension, and

establishing generalization bounds. In meta learning, there has so far been a
divide between information-theoretic results and results from classical
learning theory. In this work, we take a first step toward bridging this
divide. Specifically, we present novel generalization bounds for meta learning
in terms of the evaluated CMI (e-CMI). To demonstrate the expressiveness of the
e-CMI framework, we apply our bounds to a representation learning setting, with
$n$ samples from $\hat n$ tasks parameterized by functions of the form $f_i

\in \mathcal H$ is the shared representation. For this setup, we show that the
e-CMI framework yields a bound that scales as $\sqrt{ \mathcal C(\mathcal
H)/(n\hat n) + \mathcal C(\mathcal F)/n} $, where $\mathcal C(\cdot)$ denotes a

based on spherical image projection of multi-parametric MRI (MP-MRI) in glioma
segmentation. Methods: The projection of planar MRI onto a spherical surface
retains global anatomical information. By incorporating such image
transformation in our proposed spherical projection-based U-Net (SPU-Net)
segmentation model design, multiple segmentation predictions can be obtained
for a single MRI. The final segmentation is the average of all predictions, and
the variation can be shown as an uncertainty map. An uncertainty score was
introduced to compare the uncertainty measurements' performance. The SPU-Net
model was implemented on 369 glioma patients with MP-MRI scans. Three SPU-Nets
were trained to segment enhancing tumor (ET), tumor core (TC), and whole tumor
(WT), respectively. The SPU-Net was compared with (1) classic U-Net with
test-time augmentation (TTA) and (2) linear scaling-based U-Net (LSU-Net) in
both segmentation accuracy (Dice coefficient) and uncertainty (uncertainty map
and uncertainty score). Results: The SPU-Net achieved low uncertainty for
correct segmentation predictions (e.g., tumor interior or healthy tissue
interior) and high uncertainty for incorrect results (e.g., tumor boundaries).
This model could allow the identification of missed tumor targets or
segmentation errors in U-Net. The SPU-Net achieved the highest uncertainty
scores for 3 targets (ET/TC/WT): 0.826/0.848/0.936, compared to
0.784/0.643/0.872 for the U-Net with TTA and 0.743/0.702/0.876 for the LSU-Net.
The SPU-Net also achieved statistically significantly higher Dice coefficients.
Conclusion: The SPU-Net offers a powerful tool to quantify glioma segmentation
uncertainty while improving segmentation accuracy. The proposed method can be
generalized to other medical image-related deep-learning applications for
uncertainty evaluation.

external suppliers are increasingly used. However, incorporating external data
poses data poisoning risks, wherein attackers manipulate their data to degrade
model utility or integrity. Most poisoning defenses presume access to a set of
clean data (or base set). While this assumption has been taken for granted,
given the fast-growing research on stealthy poisoning attacks, a question
arises: can defenders really identify a clean subset within a contaminated
dataset to support defenses?
  This paper starts by examining the impact of poisoned samples on defenses
when they are mistakenly mixed into the base set. We analyze five defenses and
find that their performance deteriorates dramatically with less than 1%
poisoned points in the base set. These findings suggest that sifting out a base
set with high precision is key to these defenses' performance. Motivated by
these observations, we study how precise existing automated tools and human
inspection are at identifying clean data in the presence of data poisoning.
Unfortunately, neither effort achieves the precision needed. Worse yet, many of
the outcomes are worse than random selection.
  In addition to uncovering the challenge, we propose a practical
countermeasure, Meta-Sift. Our method is based on the insight that existing
attacks' poisoned samples shifts from clean data distributions. Hence, training
on the clean portion of a dataset and testing on the corrupted portion will
result in high prediction loss. Leveraging the insight, we formulate a bilevel
optimization to identify clean data and further introduce a suite of techniques
to improve efficiency and precision. Our evaluation shows that Meta-Sift can
sift a clean base set with 100% precision under a wide range of poisoning
attacks. The selected base set is large enough to give rise to successful
defenses.

Such a parton propagation is usually considered in the limit of transversely
homogeneous matter. The transport processes admit a classical description and
the transverse spatial dependence of the medium properties emerges only through
the jet quenching parameter. In this work, we show that a gradient expansion of
the all-order evolution equation for the partonic Wigner function leads to an
evolution equation in the Boltzmann-diffusion form only up to the leading order

efficiency of the inference algorithms used to estimate model parameters is
therefore questioned. Many of these are based on stochastic optimization
processes which waste a significant part of the computation time due to their
rejection sampling approaches. We introduce the Fixed Landscape Inference
MethOd (\textit{flimo}), a new likelihood-free inference method for continuous
state-space stochastic models. It applies deterministic gradient-based
optimization algorithms to obtain a point estimate of the parameters,
minimizing the difference between the data and some simulations according to
some prescribed summary statistics. In this sense, it is analogous to
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). Like ABC, it can also provide an
approximation of the distribution of the parameters. Three applications are
proposed: a usual theoretical example, namely the inference of the parameters
of g-and-k distributions; a population genetics problem, not so simple as it
seems, namely the inference of a selective value from time series in a
Wright-Fisher model; and simulations from a Ricker model, representing chaotic
population dynamics. In the two first applications, the results show a drastic
reduction of the computational time needed for the inference phase compared to
the other methods, despite an equivalent accuracy. Even when likelihood-based
methods are applicable, the simplicity and efficiency of \textit{flimo} make it
a compelling alternative. Implementations in Julia and in R are available on
\url{https://metabarcoding.org/flimo}. To run \textit{flimo}, the user must
simply be able to simulate data according to the chosen model.

our model learns subwords that optimise LM performance. We train our model on

existing approaches such as BPE-based models on average across the 4 languages.
Furthermore, it outperforms standard subword segmenters on unsupervised

complex autonomous systems such as robotics and manufacturing. Favorable

in combination with an overlapping additive Schwarz-based iterative scheme to
compute MFA with a tensor expansion of B-spline bases, while preserving full
degree continuity across subdomain boundaries. While previous work on MFA has
been successfully proven to be effective, the computational complexity of
encoding large datasets on a single process can be severely prohibitive.
Parallel algorithms for generating reconstructions from the MFA have had to
rely on post-processing techniques to blend discontinuities across subdomain
boundaries. In contrast, a robust constrained minimization infrastructure to
impose higher-order continuity directly on the MFA representation is presented
here. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the parallel approach with domain
decomposition solvers, to minimize the subdomain error residuals of the decoded
MFA, and more specifically to recover continuity across non-matching boundaries
at scale. The analysis of the presented scheme for analytical and scientific
datasets in 1-, 2- and 3-dimensions are presented. Extensive strong and weak
scalability performances are also demonstrated for large-scale datasets to

in different domains, such as thermal to visible images (VIS), sketches to
visible images, near-infrared to visible, and so on. This is particularly
useful in matching visible spectrum images to images captured from other
modalities. Though highly useful, HFR is challenging because of the domain gap
between the source and target domain. Often, large-scale paired heterogeneous
face image datasets are absent, preventing training models specifically for the
heterogeneous task. In this work, we propose a surprisingly simple, yet, very
effective method for matching face images across different sensing modalities.
The core idea of the proposed approach is to add a novel neural network block
called Prepended Domain Transformer (PDT) in front of a pre-trained face
recognition (FR) model to address the domain gap. Retraining this new block
with few paired samples in a contrastive learning setup was enough to achieve
state-of-the-art performance in many HFR benchmarks. The PDT blocks can be
retrained for several source-target combinations using the proposed general
framework. The proposed approach is architecture agnostic, meaning they can be
added to any pre-trained FR models. Further, the approach is modular and the
new block can be trained with a minimal set of paired samples, making it much
easier for practical deployment. The source code and protocols will be made
available publicly.

sampling from a distribution $\propto e^{-f(x)}$ is called log-concave
sampling. This task has wide applications in machine learning, physics,
statistics, etc. In this work, we develop quantum algorithms for sampling
log-concave distributions and for estimating their normalizing constants
$\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}e^{-f(x)}\mathrm{d} x$. First, we use underdamped Langevin
diffusion to develop quantum algorithms that match the query complexity (in
terms of the condition number $\kappa$ and dimension $d$) of analogous
classical algorithms that use gradient (first-order) queries, even though the
quantum algorithms use only evaluation (zeroth-order) queries. For estimating
normalizing constants, these algorithms also achieve quadratic speedup in the
multiplicative error $\epsilon$. Second, we develop quantum Metropolis-adjusted
Langevin algorithms with query complexity $\widetilde{O}(\kappa^{1/2}d)$ and
$\widetilde{O}(\kappa^{1/2}d^{3/2}/\epsilon)$ for log-concave sampling and
normalizing constant estimation, respectively, achieving polynomial speedups in
$\kappa,d,\epsilon$ over the best known classical algorithms by exploiting
quantum analogs of the Monte Carlo method and quantum walks. We also prove a
$1/\epsilon^{1-o(1)}$ quantum lower bound for estimating normalizing constants,
implying near-optimality of our quantum algorithms in $\epsilon$.

data generation, a careful balance must be achieved between reconstruction
error and how close the distribution in the latent space is to the prior.
However, this balance is challenging to achieve due to a lack of criteria that
work both at the mini-batch (local) and aggregated posterior (global) level.
Goodness of fit (GoF) hypothesis tests provide a measure of statistical
indistinguishability between the latent distribution and a target distribution
class. In this work, we develop the Goodness of Fit Autoencoder (GoFAE), which
incorporates hypothesis tests at two levels. At the mini-batch level, it uses
GoF test statistics as regularization objectives. At a more global level, it
selects a regularization coefficient based on higher criticism, i.e., a test on
the uniformity of the local GoF p-values. We justify the use of GoF tests by
providing a relaxed $L_2$-Wasserstein bound on the distance between the latent
distribution and target prior. We propose to use GoF tests and prove that
optimization based on these tests can be done with stochastic gradient (SGD)
descent on a compact Riemannian manifold. Empirically, we show that our higher
criticism parameter selection procedure balances reconstruction and generation
using mutual information and uniformity of p-values respectively. Finally, we
show that GoFAE achieves comparable FID scores and mean squared errors with

indistinguishability from Gaussian in the latent space based on a variety of

suggest that late-time non-thermal particle acceleration occurs within the
afterglow model when the shock is no longer relativistic, which may prove vital
for detecting afterglows from other Galactic FRBs. We also discuss future

phenomena across the sciences. However, the utility of simulators for modelling
and forecasting purposes is often restricted by low data quality, as well as
practical limits to model fidelity. In order to circumvent these difficulties,
we argue that modellers must treat simulators as idealistic representations of
the true data generating process, and consequently should thoughtfully consider
the risk of model misspecification. In this work we revisit neural posterior
estimation (NPE), a class of algorithms that enable black-box parameter
inference in simulation models, and consider the implication of a
simulation-to-reality gap. While recent works have demonstrated reliable
performance of these methods, the analyses have been performed using synthetic
data generated by the simulator model itself, and have therefore only addressed
the well-specified case. In this paper, we find that the presence of
misspecification, in contrast, leads to unreliable inference when NPE is used
naively. As a remedy we argue that principled scientific inquiry with
simulators should incorporate a model criticism component, to facilitate
interpretable identification of misspecification and a robust inference
component, to fit 'wrong but useful' models. We propose robust neural posterior
estimation (RNPE), an extension of NPE to simultaneously achieve both these
aims, through explicitly modelling the discrepancies between simulations and
the observed data. We assess the approach on a range of artificially
misspecified examples, and find RNPE performs well across the tasks, whereas
naively using NPE leads to misleading and erratic posteriors.

mainly focus on removing daytime flares and fail in nighttime. Nighttime flare
removal is challenging because of the unique luminance and spectrum of
artificial lights and the diverse patterns and image degradation of the flares
captured at night. The scarcity of nighttime flare removal datasets limits the
research on this crucial task. In this paper, we introduce, Flare7K, the first
nighttime flare removal dataset, which is generated based on the observation
and statistics of real-world nighttime lens flares. It offers 5,000 scattering
and 2,000 reflective flare images, consisting of 25 types of scattering flares
and 10 types of reflective flares. The 7,000 flare patterns can be randomly
added to flare-free images, forming the flare-corrupted and flare-free image
pairs. With the paired data, we can train deep models to restore
flare-corrupted images taken in the real world effectively. Apart from abundant
flare patterns, we also provide rich annotations, including the labeling of
light source, glare with shimmer, reflective flare, and streak, which are
commonly absent from existing datasets. Hence, our dataset can facilitate new
work in nighttime flare removal and more fine-grained analysis of flare

our targets the detectability rate of a light curve period is $\sim$56%,
notably lower than in the case of other small body populations, like Hildas or
Jovian trojans. We managed to obtain light curve periods with an acceptable
confidence for 37 targets; the majority of these cases are new identifications.
We were able to give light curve amplitude upper limits for the other 29
targets. Several of the newly detected light curve periods are longer than
$\sim$24 h, in many cases close to $\sim$80 h, i.e., these targets are slow
rotators. This relative abundance of slowly rotating objects is similar to that
observed among Hildas, Jovian trojans and Centaurs in the K2 mission, and also
among main belt asteroids measured with the TESS Space Telescope.
Transneptunian objects show notably higher light curve amplitudes at large (D
$\gtrsim$ 300 km) sizes than that found among large main belt asteroids, in

fluctuations are subject to Landau damping by electronic particle-hole

is weakly irrelevant at the N\'eel quantum critical point, despite the fact
that the corresponding self-energy correction dominates over the quadratic

increases under the RG, indicative of damped spin-wave excitations. Although
the Kondo coupling is weakly relevant, sufficiently strong Landau damping
renders the N\'eel quantum critical point quasi-stable for $N_f\ge 4$ and
thermodynamically stable for $N_f<4$. In the latter case, we identify a new
multi-critical point which describes the transition between the N\'eel critical
and Kondo run-away regimes. The symmetry breaking at this fixed point results
in the opening of a gap in the Dirac fermion spectrum. Approaching the

the speed of explanation generation, robustness/sensitivity and succinctness of
explanations (sparsity) have been relatively unexplored. In this paper, we
present FASTER-CE: a novel set of algorithms to generate fast, sparse, and
robust counterfactual explanations. The key idea is to efficiently find
promising search directions for counterfactuals in a latent space that is
specified via an autoencoder. These directions are determined based on
gradients with respect to each of the original input features as well as of the
target, as estimated in the latent space. The ability to quickly examine
combinations of the most promising gradient directions as well as to
incorporate additional user-defined constraints allows us to generate multiple
counterfactual explanations that are sparse, realistic, and robust to input
manipulations. Through experiments on three datasets of varied complexities, we
show that FASTER-CE is not only much faster than other state of the art methods
for generating multiple explanations but also is significantly superior when

energy of a point charge finite, for the 3 dimensional theory which includes a
CS term such a replacement leads to a finite energy for the solution of above.
We refer to this soliton as a CSBIon solution, representing a finite energy
version of the fundamental (sourced) charged electron of Maxwell theory in 4
dimensions. In 3 dimensions the BI+CS action has a static charged solution with
finite energy and no source, hence a soliton solution. The CSBIon, similar to
its Maxwellian predecessor, has a charge $N$, angular momentum proportional to
$N$ and an $N$-independent radius. We also present other nonlinear
modifications of Maxwell theory that admit similar solitons. The CSBIon may be
relevant in various holographic scenarios. In particular, it may describe a
D6-brane wrapping an $S^4$ in a compactified D4-brane background. We believe
that the CSBIon may play a role in condensed matter systems in 2+1 dimensions
like graphene sheets.

have not yet been able to achieve competitive performance on practical vision
tasks such as large-scale image and video classification. Building on a recent
line of work on deep state space models (SSMs), we propose S4ND, a new
multidimensional SSM layer that extends the continuous-signal modeling ability
of SSMs to multidimensional data including images and videos. We show that S4ND
can model large-scale visual data in $1$D, $2$D, and $3$D as continuous
multidimensional signals and demonstrates strong performance by simply swapping
Conv2D and self-attention layers with S4ND layers in existing state-of-the-art

baseline by $1.5\%$ when training with a $1$D sequence of patches, and matches
ConvNeXt when modeling images in $2$D. For videos, S4ND improves on an inflated
$3$D ConvNeXt in activity classification on HMDB-51 by $4\%$. S4ND implicitly
learns global, continuous convolutional kernels that are resolution invariant
by construction, providing an inductive bias that enables generalization across
multiple resolutions. By developing a simple bandlimiting modification to S4 to
overcome aliasing, S4ND achieves strong zero-shot (unseen at training time)
resolution performance, outperforming a baseline Conv2D by $40\%$ on CIFAR-10
when trained on $8 \times 8$ and tested on $32 \times 32$ images. When trained
with progressive resizing, S4ND comes within $\sim 1\%$ of a high-resolution

stellar rotation periods in the temperature-period diagram at $\sim$ 20 days
for G dwarfs and up to $\sim$ 30 days for early-M dwarfs. However, because
Kepler mainly targeted solar-like stars, there is a lack of measured periods
for M dwarfs, especially those at the fully convective limit. Therefore it is
unclear if the intermediate period gap exists for mid- to late-M dwarfs. Here,
we present a period catalog containing 40,553 rotation periods (9,535 periods
$>$ 10 days), measured using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). To measure
these periods, we developed a simple pipeline that improves directly on the ZTF
archival light curves and reduces the photometric scatter by 26%, on average.
This new catalog spans a range of stellar temperatures that connect samples
from Kepler with MEarth, a ground-based time domain survey of bright M-dwarfs,
and reveals that the intermediate period gap closes at the theoretically
predicted location of the fully convective boundary ($G_{\rm BP} - G_{\rm RP}
\sim 2.45$ mag). This result supports the hypothesis that the gap is caused by
core-envelope interactions. Using gyro-kinematic ages, we also find a potential

challenging measurement of the thermal Hall conductivity. Here, we report the
electrical detection of MHE with high sensitivity in Lu$_2$V$_2$O$_7$/heavy
metal heterostructures, highly desirable for the exploration of new materials
with MHE and their applications. Using wires with different Seebeck
coefficients, we can identify and separate MHE from other spin caloritronic
effects of anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) and spin Seebeck effect (SSE), crucial
for distinguishing different constituents in spin caloritronic phenomena. We
have found that a thick heavy metal overlayer can eliminate the signals from
ANE and SSE, and that the MHE is robust with respect to the different deposited
heavy metals. The MHE in Lu$_2$V$_2$O$_7$ is isotropic among crystals with
different orientations. In addition to previously realized transverse MHE, we
have also uncovered longitudinal MHE, where the temperature gradient has been
applied in the in-plane and the out-of-plane directions, respectively.

can be also used to augment existing traffic scenarios, by adding new vehicles
and extending the fragmented trajectories. We further demonstrate that
importing the generated scenarios into a simulator as interactive training

hidden confounder. This objective is attained by first estimating the
conditional mean of the desired outcome variable given relevant covariates (the
""first stage"" regression), and then taking the (conditional) expectation of
this function as a ""second stage"" procedure. We propose to compute these
conditional expectations directly using a regression function to the learned

density estimation. All functions and features (and in particular, the output
features in the second stage) are neural networks learned adaptively from data,
with the sole requirement that the final layer of the first stage should be

decreases for wider columns or higher mass accretion rates. In contrast to the
case of shorter columns in uniform magnetic fields, pdV work contributes
substantially to maintaining the radiation pressure inside the column against
sideways radiative cooling. This is in part due to the compression associated
with accretion along the converging magnetic field lines towards the stellar
surface. Propagating entropy waves which are associated with the slow-diffusion

training data. There is no facile protocol available to select a deep learning
architecture, and there is a lack of a large volume of homogeneous
sequence-property data of polymers. These two factors are the primary
bottleneck for the efficient development of deep learning models. Here we
assess the severity of these factors and propose new algorithms to address

help in identifying the best neural network topology for a given problem.
Moreover, we map the discrete sequence space of a polymer to a continuous

minimal data points for building a universal deep learning model. We implement

task which involves four elements from user-generated texts: aspect term,
aspect category, opinion term, and sentiment polarity. Most computational
approaches focus on some of the ABSA sub-tasks such as tuple (aspect term,
sentiment polarity) or triplet (aspect term, opinion term, sentiment polarity)
extraction using either pipeline or joint modeling approaches. Recently,
generative approaches have been proposed to extract all four elements as (one
or more) quadruplets from text as a single task. In this work, we take a step
further and propose a unified framework for solving ABSA, and the associated
sub-tasks to improve the performance in few-shot scenarios. To this end, we
fine-tune a T5 model with instructional prompts in a multi-task learning
fashion covering all the sub-tasks, as well as the entire quadruple prediction
task. In experiments with multiple benchmark data sets, we show that the
proposed multi-task prompting approach brings performance boost (by absolute
$6.75$ F1) in the few-shot learning setting.

where a normal metal (NM) spacer separates a spin-polarizer (FM$_p$) from a
spin-analyzer (FM$_a$) FM layer. The injection of a current pulse endows the
spin-valve system with rich nonequilibrium dynamics, where a quantum
superposition of many-body states places the spatially separated FM layers into
a mixed entangled state, after tracing out the degrees of freedom of the
conduction electrons. This is due to a transfer of spin angular momentum from
conduction electrons to the localized spins via a quantum spin-transfer torque
mechanism that remains active even for {\em collinear but antiparallel}
arrangements of the FM$_p$ and FM$_a$ magnetizations, a situation in which the
conventional spin-torque is absent. The dynamical build-up of mixed-state

sample-efficient optimization in domains with expensive function evaluations.
The existing BO techniques are capable of finding a single global optimum
solution. However, finding a set of global and local optimum solutions is
crucial in a wide range of real-world problems, as implementing some of the
optimal solutions might not be feasible due to various practical restrictions
(e.g., resource limitation, physical constraints, etc.). In such domains, if
multiple solutions are known, the implementation can be quickly switched to
another solution, and the best possible system performance can still be
obtained. This paper develops a multi-modal BO framework to effectively find a
set of local/global solutions for expensive-to-evaluate multi-modal objective
functions. We consider the standard BO setting with Gaussian process regression
representing the objective function. We analytically derive the joint
distribution of the objective function and its first-order gradients. This
joint distribution is used in the body of the BO acquisition functions to
search for local optima during the optimization process. We introduce variants
of the well-known BO acquisition functions to the multi-modal setting and
demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework in locating a set of
local optimum solutions using multiple optimization problems.

with high accuracy and high resolution, but carries a large computational cost.
Here we present an alternative deep-learning approach for earthquake location
by combining the benefits of neural operators for wave propagation and time
reversal imaging with multi-station waveform recordings. A U-shaped neural
operator is trained to propagate seismic waves with various source time
functions and thus can predict a backpropagated wavefield for each station in
negligible time. These wavefields can either be stacked or correlated to locate
earthquakes from the resulting source images. Compared with other
waveform-based deep-learning location methods, time reversal imaging accounts
for physical laws of wave propagation and is expected to achieve accurate
earthquake location. We demonstrate the method with the 2D acoustic wave
equation on both synthetic and field data. The results show that our method can
efficiently obtain high resolution and high accuracy correlation-based time
reversal imaging of earthquake sources. Moreover, our approach is adaptable to
the number and geometry of seismic stations, which opens new strategies for
real-time earthquake location and monitoring with dense seismic networks.

Weyl semimetal coupled with a $U(1)$ gauge (electromagnetic) field. A key role
is played by the soft dispersion of the photons in a particular direction, say
$\hat{z}$, due to the Hall conductivity of the Weyl semimetal. Due to the soft
photon, the fermion velocity in $\hat{z}$ is logarithmically reduced under
renormalization group flow, together with the fine structure constant.
Meanwhile, fermions acquire a finite lifetime from spontaneous emission of the
soft photon, namely the Cherenkov radiation. At low energy $E$, the inverse of
the fermion lifetime scales as $\tau^{-1}\sim E/{\rm PolyLog}(E)$. Therefore,
even though fermion quasiparticles are eventually well-defined at very low
energy, over a wide intermediate energy window the Weyl semimetal behaves like
a marginal Fermi liquid. Phenomenologically, our results are more relevant for
emergent Weyl semimetals, where the fermions and photons all emerge from
strongly correlated lattice systems. Possible experimental implications are
discussed.

three weeks, we have found that it may be one of the most massive neutron stars

structure with a subcritical field strength and a carbon atmosphere
composition. Due to the time-resolution limitation of the available light

  IoE in Wireless Network","Submitted to a journal for peer review",,,,"cs.AI cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) twin systems will be a fundamental
enabler of zero-touch network and service management (ZSM) for sixth-generation
(6G) wireless networks. A reliable XAI twin system for ZSM requires two
composites: an extreme analytical ability for discretizing the physical
behavior of the Internet of Everything (IoE) and rigorous methods for
characterizing the reasoning of such behavior. In this paper, a novel
neuro-symbolic explainable artificial intelligence twin framework is proposed
to enable trustworthy ZSM for a wireless IoE. The physical space of the XAI
twin executes a neural-network-driven multivariate regression to capture the
time-dependent wireless IoE environment while determining unconscious decisions
of IoE service aggregation. Subsequently, the virtual space of the XAI twin
constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based Bayesian network that can infer
a symbolic reasoning score over unconscious decisions through a first-order
probabilistic language model. Furthermore, a Bayesian multi-arm bandits-based
learning problem is proposed for reducing the gap between the expected
explained score and the current obtained score of the proposed neuro-symbolic
XAI twin. To address the challenges of extensible, modular, and stateless
management functions in ZSM, the proposed neuro-symbolic XAI twin framework
consists of two learning systems: 1) an implicit learner that acts as an
unconscious learner in physical space, and 2) an explicit leaner that can
exploit symbolic reasoning based on implicit learner decisions and prior
evidence. Experimental results show that the proposed neuro-symbolic XAI twin
can achieve around 96.26% accuracy while guaranteeing from 18% to 44% more
trust score in terms of reasoning and closed-loop automation.

Kagome lattice materials are emerging as an exciting platform for realizing
quantum topology in the presence of electron correlations. This proposal stems
from the key signatures of electronic structures associated with its lattice
geometry: flat band induced by destructive interference of the electronic
wavefunctions, topological Dirac crossing, and a pair of van Hove singularities
(vHSs). A plethora of correlated electronic phases have been discovered amongst
kagome lattice materials, including magnetism, charge density wave (CDW),
nematicity, and superconductivity. These materials can be largely organized
into two types: those that host magnetism and those that host CDW order.
Recently, a CDW order has been discovered in the magnetic kagome FeGe,
providing a new platform for understanding the interplay between CDW and
magnetism. Here, utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we
observe all three types of electronic signatures of the kagome lattice: flat
bands, Dirac crossings, and vHSs. From both the observation of a
temperature-dependent shift of the vHSs towards the Fermi level as well as
guidance via first-principle calculations, we identify the presence of the vHSs
near the Fermi level (EF) to be driven by the development of underlying
magnetic exchange splitting. Furthermore, we show spectral evidence for the CDW
order as gaps that open on the near-EF vHS bands, as well as evidence of
electron-phonon coupling from a kink on the vHS band together with phonon
hardening observed by inelastic neutron scattering. Our observation points to
the magnetic interaction-driven band modification resulting in the formation of
the CDW order, indicating an intertwined connection between the emergent
magnetism and vHS charge order in this moderately-correlated kagome metal.

coherence tomography (OCT) scans; (2) To assess whether 3D macula or ONH
structures (or the combination of both) provide the best diagnostic power for
glaucoma. Methods: A cross-sectional comparative study was performed which
included wide-field swept-source OCT scans from 319 glaucoma subjects and 298
non-glaucoma subjects. All scans were compensated to improve deep-tissue
visibility. We developed a deep learning algorithm to automatically label all
major ONH tissue structures by using 270 manually annotated B-scans for
training. The performance of our algorithm was assessed using the Dice
coefficient (DC). A glaucoma classification algorithm (3D CNN) was then
designed using a combination of 500 OCT volumes and their corresponding
automatically segmented masks. This algorithm was trained and tested on 3
datasets: OCT scans cropped to contain the macular tissues only, those to
contain the ONH tissues only, and the full wide-field OCT scans. The
classification performance for each dataset was reported using the AUC.
Results: Our segmentation algorithm was able to segment ONH and macular tissues
with a DC of 0.94 $\pm$ 0.003. The classification algorithm was best able to
diagnose glaucoma using wide-field 3D-OCT volumes with an AUC of 0.99 $\pm$
0.01, followed by ONH volumes with an AUC of 0.93 $\pm$ 0.06, and finally
macular volumes with an AUC of 0.91 $\pm$ 0.11. Conclusions: this study showed
that using wide-field OCT as compared to the typical OCT images containing just
the ONH or macular may allow for a significantly improved glaucoma diagnosis.
This may encourage the mainstream adoption of 3D wide-field OCT scans. For
clinical AI studies that use traditional machines, we would recommend the use
of ONH scans as opposed to macula scans.

composition reflective of the host star's iron and rock-building element

likely not primordial. We also demonstrate that the composition determination
is sensitive to the choice of stellar parameters, and that further measurements

flows to one of the stable fixed points if $h \neq 0$, and to the discontinuity

This is accomplished by a sonographer who uses ultrasound transducer to apply

is obtained before and after the compression. This stress along the axial
direction not only causes deformation in that direction but it can also cause
lateral deformation in the tissue. This relative deformation is later
calculated using tracking algorithms. Finally, estimating the elasticity,
images are formed. In this paper, we introduce a novel strain estimator. The

searches the lateral direction for taking the non-axial movement into account.
We have investigated the performance of our estimator using simulated and

comparing with different methods up to 16\% applied strain. The proposed

methods. The image quality significantly improves, especially in the presence

more attention due to their event-driven and energy-efficient characteristics.
The integration of storage and computation paradigm on neuromorphic hardwares
makes SNNs much different from Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we
argue that SNNs may not benefit from the weight-sharing mechanism, which can
effectively reduce parameters and improve inference efficiency in DNNs, in some
hardwares, and assume that an SNN with unshared convolution kernels could
perform better. Motivated by this assumption, a training-inference decoupling
method for SNNs named as Real Spike is proposed, which not only enjoys both
unshared convolution kernels and binary spikes in inference-time but also
maintains both shared convolution kernels and Real-valued Spikes during
training. This decoupling mechanism of SNN is realized by a re-parameterization
technique. Furthermore, based on the training-inference-decoupled idea, a
series of different forms for implementing Real Spike on different levels are
presented, which also enjoy shared convolutions in the inference and are
friendly to both neuromorphic and non-neuromorphic hardware platforms. A
theoretical proof is given to clarify that the Real Spike-based SNN network is
superior to its vanilla counterpart. Experimental results show that all
different Real Spike versions can consistently improve the SNN performance.
Moreover, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on both

its generalization ability hopefully promotes policy learning if properly
utilized. To that end, several works propose to quantify the uncertainty of
predicted dynamics, and explicitly apply it to penalize reward. However, as the
dynamics and the reward are intrinsically different factors in context of MDP,
characterizing the impact of dynamics uncertainty through reward penalty may
incur unexpected tradeoff between model utilization and risk avoidance. In this
work, we instead maintain a belief distribution over dynamics, and
evaluate/optimize policy through biased sampling from the belief. The sampling
procedure, biased towards pessimism, is derived based on an alternating Markov
game formulation of offline RL. We formally show that the biased sampling
naturally induces an updated dynamics belief with policy-dependent reweighting

devise an iterative regularized policy optimization algorithm for the game,

this study, we are the first to investigate the representative potential of

Therefore, the model can be expressed as \textit{one-layer} with a bunch of

Maximizing or minimizing surprise drives the agent to either explore or gain
control over its environment. However, both strategies rely on a strong
assumption: the entropy of the environment's dynamics is either high or low.
This assumption may not always hold in real-world scenarios, where the entropy
of the environment's dynamics may be unknown. Hence, choosing between the two
objectives is a dilemma. We propose a novel yet simple mixture of policies to
address this concern, allowing us to optimize an objective that simultaneously
maximizes and minimizes the surprise. Concretely, we train one mixture

also introduced the study of co-degeneracy (the degeneracy of the complement
graph) as a parameter. In 1976, Bondy and Chv\'{a}tal [DM 1976] introduced the
notion of closure of a graph: let $\ell$ be an integer; the $(n+\ell)$-closure,
$\operatorname{cl}_{n+\ell}(G)$, of a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is obtained
from $G$ by recursively adding an edge between pairs of nonadjacent vertices

property $\Upsilon$ defined on all graphs of order $n$ is said to be

$\Upsilon$, the fact that $uv$ is not an edge of $G$ and that $G+uv$ satisfies
$\Upsilon$ implies $d(u)+d(v)< n+\ell$. Duarte et al. [MFCS 2021] developed an
algorithmic framework for co-degeneracy parameterization based on the notion of
closures for solving problems that are $(n+\ell)$-stable for some $\ell$

exploiting the underlying geometric structures of the data. Specifically, we
effectively filter out candidate poisoned data at each training epoch by
solving a geometrical coreset selection objective. We first argue how clean

been elusive, there has been a lot of recent progress in understanding the
convergence of Gradient Flow (GF) on the population loss, partly due to the
simplicity that a continuous-time analysis buys us. An overarching theme of our
paper is providing general conditions under which SGD converges, assuming that
GF on the population loss converges. Our main tool to establish this connection
is a general converse Lyapunov like theorem, which implies the existence of a
Lyapunov potential under mild assumptions on the rates of convergence of GF. In
fact, using these potentials, we show a one-to-one correspondence between rates
of convergence of GF and geometrical properties of the underlying objective.
When these potentials further satisfy certain self-bounding properties, we show
that they can be used to provide a convergence guarantee for Gradient Descent

turns out that these self-bounding assumptions are in a sense also necessary

performance on various visual tasks, but suffer from expensive computational
and memory cost problems when deployed on resource-constrained devices. Among
the powerful compression approaches, quantization extremely reduces the
computation and memory consumption by low-bit parameters and bit-wise
operations. However, low-bit ViTs remain largely unexplored and usually suffer
from a significant performance drop compared with the real-valued counterparts.
In this work, through extensive empirical analysis, we first identify the
bottleneck for severe performance drop comes from the information distortion of
the low-bit quantized self-attention map. We then develop an information
rectification module (IRM) and a distribution guided distillation (DGD) scheme
for fully quantized vision transformers (Q-ViT) to effectively eliminate such
distortion, leading to a fully quantized ViTs. We evaluate our methods on
popular DeiT and Swin backbones. Extensive experimental results show that our
method achieves a much better performance than the prior arts. For example, our
Q-ViT can theoretically accelerates the ViT-S by 6.14x and achieves about 80.9%

Additionally, $\omega_{XY}$ is computed independently of templates. We find
that current empirical templates are successful at reproducing the features

bottlenecks in developing computational techniques for solving the inverse
problem in long-range imaging. The classical split-step method is based upon
numerical wave propagation which splits the propagation path into many segments
and propagates every pixel in each segment individually via the Fresnel
integral. This repeated evaluation becomes increasingly time-consuming for
larger images. As a result, the split-step simulation is often done only on a
sparse grid of points followed by an interpolation to the other pixels. Even
so, the computation is expensive for real-time applications. In this paper, we
present a new simulation method that enables \emph{real-time} processing over a
\emph{dense} grid of points. Building upon the recently developed
multi-aperture model and the phase-to-space transform, we overcome the memory
bottleneck in drawing random samples from the Zernike correlation tensor. We
show that the cross-correlation of the Zernike modes has an insignificant
contribution to the statistics of the random samples. By approximating these
cross-correlation blocks in the Zernike tensor, we restore the homogeneity of
the tensor which then enables Fourier-based random sampling. On a
$512\times512$ image, the new simulator achieves 0.025 seconds per frame over a
dense field. On a $3840 \times 2160$ image which would have taken 13 hours to
simulate using the split-step method, the new simulator can run at
approximately 60 seconds per frame.

Existing approaches for CBB usually ignore the rewards of the non-executed

an instantaneous regret with a controllable bias and a smaller variance than

injection attacks. Then, it retrieves the control signal using the acquired
information. This process is accomplished in three main modules, with novel
designs, for detection, classification, and control signal retrieval. The
detection module monitors historical changes in phasor measurements and
captures any deviation pattern caused by an attack on a complex plane. This
approach can help to reveal characteristics of the attacks including the
direction, magnitude, and ratio of the injected false data. Using this
information, the signal retrieval module can easily recover the original
control signal and remove the injected false data. Further information
regarding the attack type can be obtained through the classifier module. The
proposed ensemble learner is compatible with harsh learning conditions
including the lack of labeled data, concept drift, concept evolution, recurring
classes, and independence from external updates. The proposed novel classifier
can dynamically learn from data and classify attacks under all these harsh

cancellation strategy for MRI with no or incomplete RF shielding. In this
study, a simultaneous sensing and deep learning driven EMI cancellation
strategy is presented to model, predict and remove EMI signals from acquired
MRI signals. Specifically, during each MRI scan, separate EMI sensing coils
placed in various spatial locations are utilized to simultaneously sample
environmental and internal EMI signals within two windows (for both
conventional MRI signal acquisition and EMI characterization acquisition). Then
a CNN model is trained using the EMI characterization data to relate EMI
signals detected by EMI sensing coils to EMI signals in MRI receive coil. This
model is utilized to retrospectively predict and remove EMI signals components
detected by MRI receive coil during the MRI signal acquisition window. We
implemented and demonstrated this strategy for various EMI sources on a mobile
ultra-low-field 0.055 T permanent magnet MRI scanner and a 1.5 T
superconducting magnet MRI scanner with no or incomplete RF shielding. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the method is highly effective and robust
in predicting and removing various EMI sources from both external environments
and internal scanner electronics at both 0.055 T (2.3 MHz) and 1.5 T (64 MHz),
producing final image signal-to-noise ratios that are comparable to those
obtained using a fully enclosed RF shielding. Our proposed strategy enables MRI
operation with no or incomplete RF shielding, alleviating MRI installation and

of accurate RF signal detection or discrimination in presence of external and

the immediate fairness, ignoring the long-term impact of a fair classifier
under the dynamic scenario where each individual can improve its feature over
time. Such dynamic scenarios happen in real world, e.g., college admission and
credit loaning, where each rejected sample makes effort to change its features
to get accepted afterwards. In this dynamic setting, the long-term fairness
should equalize the samples' feature distribution across different groups after
the rejected samples make some effort to improve. In order to promote long-term
fairness, we propose a new fairness notion called Equal Improvability (EI),
which equalizes the potential acceptance rate of the rejected samples across
different groups assuming a bounded level of effort will be spent by each
rejected sample. We analyze the properties of EI and its connections with
existing fairness notions. To find a classifier that satisfies the EI
requirement, we propose and study three different approaches that solve
EI-regularized optimization problems. Through experiments on both synthetic and

encourage us to find a fair classifier in terms of EI. Finally, we provide
experimental results on dynamic scenarios which highlight the advantages of our
EI metric in achieving the long-term fairness. Codes are available in a GitHub

discrete systems, where a trapped mode exists under certain conditions, namely,
the anti-localization of non-stationary linear waves. This is zeroing of the
non-localized propagating component of the wave-field in a neighbourhood of an
inclusion. In other words, it is a tendency for non-stationary waves to
propagate avoiding a neighbourhood of an inclusion. The anti-localization is
caused by a destructive interference of the harmonics involved into the
representation of the solution in the form of a Fourier integral. The
anti-localization is associated with the waves from the pass-band, whereas the
localization related with a trapped mode is due to poles inside the stop-band.
In the framework of a simple illustrative problem considered in the paper, we
have demonstrated that the anti-localization exists for all cases excepting the
boundary of the domain in the parameter space where the wave localization
occurs. Thus, the anti-localization can be observed in the absence of the
localization as well as together with the localization. We also investigate the
influence of the anti-localization on the wave-field in whole.

concept of `Proof of Work' (PoW). The miners, nodes responsible for writing
transaction databases, solve a cryptographic puzzle to claim the right to write
to the database. Though bitcoin and many other relevant cryptocurrencies, such
as ether use revolutionary ideas, the main criticism involves computing
resources and energy consumption to solve puzzles that have otherwise no use.
There are attempts to use the PoW to do something useful, commonly referred to
as Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW). In this paper, we attempt to (i) make PoUW more
usable -- describe how a central problem setter can crowdsource their work as
PoUW and (ii) in the true spirit of blockchains, decentralize the role of
problem setter, whom we call puzzlers. We propose a formal framework to do so,
namely PUPoW. PUPoW has an inbuilt provision of payments from the puzzler to
the miner who solves its puzzle. Additionally, miners have the option to not
rely on a continuous feed of the puzzles and instead use original PoW puzzles.
  We also propose a way to use PUPOW for solving TOR vanity URL generation and
bitcoin vanity address generation problems. We call this PUPoW blockchain
solving vanity address generation problems as VanityCoin. Both problems require
generating public keys from private keys such that resultant addresses are of
interest. Such key pairs are found only by a brute-force search. However, there
are privacy concerns that miners would know the private keys of the puzzlers.
We resolve this by splitting the private keys, and the miners would know only
one part of it. In summary, we are proposing how PoW can be made practically
helpful, and we believe such an approach is needed for PoW blockchains to
survive.

energy complexity, which is related to the number of gates that output true in

counting of `firing' neurons in a natural neural network. The initial model is
based on threshold circuits, but recent works also have analyzed the energy
complexity of traditional Boolean circuits. In this work, we discuss the time
complexity needed to compute the best-case energy complexity among satisfying
assignments of a monotone Boolean circuit, and we call such a problem as
MinEC$^+_M$. In the MinEC$^+_M$ problem, we are given a monotone Boolean
circuit $C$, a positive integer $k$ and asked to determine whether there is a
satisfying assignment $X$ for $C$ such that $EC(C,X) \leq k$, where $EC(C,X)$
is the number of gates that output true in $C$ according to the assignment $X$.

Inspired by language processing applications, we study the orthogonal

two inputs -- an input sequence and a ``knowledge'' -- and outputting another
sequence. The knowledge consists of a set of vectors in the same embedding
space as the input sequence, containing the information of the language used to
process the input sequence. We show that orthogonal equivariance in the
embedding space is natural for seq2seq functions with knowledge, and under such
equivariance the function must take the form close to the self-attention. This
shows that network structures similar to self-attention are the right
structures to represent the target function of many seq2seq problems. The
representation can be further refined if a ``finite information principle'' is

oriented object detection, our approach is not susceptible to the prediction
quality of mask and can perform more robustly in complex scenes containing a

the drawing of the species tree fills a rectangle in which each of its edges is
represented by a smaller rectangle, and the gene trees are drawn as rectangular
cladograms (that is, orthogonally and downward, with one bend per edge) inside
the drawing of the species tree. As an alternative, we also consider a style
where the widths of the edges of the species tree are proportional to given
effective population sizes.
  In order to obtain readable visualizations, our aim is to minimize the number
of crossings between edges of the gene trees in such drawings. We show that
planar instances can be recognized in linear time and that the general problem
is NP-hard. Therefore, we introduce two heuristics and give an integer linear
programming (ILP) formulation that provides us with exact solutions in
exponential time. We use the ILP to measure the quality of the heuristics on
real-world instances. The heuristics yield surprisingly good solutions, and the
ILP runs surprisingly fast.

In this paper, we view and analyze, for the first time, the entire text of a

PoliGraph, a type of knowledge graph that captures different relations between
different parts of the text in a privacy policy; and (2) we develop an
NLP-based tool, PoliGraph-er, to automatically extract PoliGraph from the text.
In addition, (3) we revisit the notion of ontologies, previously defined in
heuristic ways, to capture subsumption relations between terms. We make a clear
distinction between local and global ontologies to capture the context of
individual privacy policies, application domains, and privacy laws. Using a
public dataset for evaluation, we show that PoliGraph-er identifies 61% more
collection statements than prior state-of-the-art, with over 90% precision. In
terms of applications, PoliGraph enables automated analysis of a corpus of
privacy policies and allows us to: (1) reveal common patterns in the texts
across different privacy policies, and (2) assess the correctness of the terms
as defined within a privacy policy. We also apply PoliGraph to: (3) detect

segmentation proves the effectiveness in the past few years. Existing RGB-D
modal fusion methods either lack the non-linear feature fusion ability or treat
both modal images equally, regardless of the intrinsic distribution gap or
information loss. Here we find that depth maps are suitable to provide
intrinsic fine-grained patterns of objects due to their local depth continuity,
while RGB images effectively provide a global view. Based on this, we propose a
pixel differential convolution attention (DCA) module to consider geometric
information and local-range correlations for depth data. Furthermore, we extend
DCA to ensemble differential convolution attention (EDCA) which propagates
long-range contextual dependencies and seamlessly incorporates spatial
distribution for RGB data. DCA and EDCA dynamically adjust convolutional
weights by pixel difference to enable self-adaptive in local and long range,
respectively. A two-branch network built with DCA and EDCA, called Differential
Convolutional Network (DCANet), is proposed to fuse local and global
information of two-modal data. Consequently, the individual advantage of RGB
and depth data are emphasized. Our DCANet is shown to set a new
state-of-the-art performance for RGB-D semantic segmentation on two challenging
benchmark datasets, i.e., NYUDv2 and SUN-RGBD.

summaries with factual errors. Numerous approaches to detect these errors have
been proposed, the most popular of which are question answering (QA)-based
factuality metrics. These have been shown to work well at predicting
summary-level factuality and have potential to localize errors within
summaries, but this latter capability has not been systematically evaluated in
past research. In this paper, we conduct the first such analysis and find that,
contrary to our expectations, QA-based frameworks fail to correctly identify
error spans in generated summaries and are outperformed by trivial exact match
baselines. Our analysis reveals a major reason for such poor localization:
questions generated by the QG module often inherit errors from non-factual
summaries which are then propagated further into downstream modules. Moreover,
even human-in-the-loop question generation cannot easily offset these problems.
Our experiments conclusively show that there exist fundamental issues with
localization using the QA framework which cannot be fixed solely by stronger QA

subset of images from the target domain, which are then annotated and used for
supervised domain adaptation (DA). Given the large performance gap between
supervised and unsupervised DA techniques, ADA allows for an excellent
trade-off between annotation cost and performance. Prior art makes use of
measures of uncertainty or disagreement of models to identify `regions' to be
annotated by the human oracle. However, these regions frequently comprise of
pixels at object boundaries which are hard and tedious to annotate. Hence, even
if the fraction of image pixels annotated reduces, the overall annotation time
and the resulting cost still remain high. In this work, we propose an ADA
strategy, which given a frame, identifies a set of classes that are hardest for
the model to predict accurately, thereby recommending semantically meaningful
regions to be annotated in a selected frame. We show that these set of `hard'
classes are context-dependent and typically vary across frames, and when
annotated help the model generalize better. We propose two ADA techniques: the
Anchor-based and Augmentation-based approaches to select complementary and
diverse regions in the context of the current training set. Our approach
achieves 66.6 mIoU on GTA to Cityscapes dataset with an annotation budget of
4.7% in comparison to 64.9 mIoU by MADA using 5% of annotations. Our technique
can also be used as a decorator for any existing frame-based AL technique,

scientific significance in revealing vision-processing mechanisms and
developing brain-like intelligent machines. Most existing methods are difficult
to generalize to novel categories that have no corresponding neural data for
training. The two main reasons are 1) the under-exploitation of the multimodal
semantic knowledge underlying the neural data and 2) the small number of paired
(stimuli-responses) training data. To overcome these limitations, this paper
presents a generic neural decoding method called BraVL that uses multimodal
learning of brain-visual-linguistic features. We focus on modeling the
relationships between brain, visual and linguistic features via multimodal deep
generative models. Specifically, we leverage the mixture-of-product-of-experts
formulation to infer a latent code that enables a coherent joint generation of
all three modalities. To learn a more consistent joint representation and
improve the data efficiency in the case of limited brain activity data, we
exploit both intra- and inter-modality mutual information maximization
regularization terms. In particular, our BraVL model can be trained under
various semi-supervised scenarios to incorporate the visual and textual
features obtained from the extra categories. Finally, we construct three
trimodal matching datasets, and the extensive experiments lead to some
interesting conclusions and cognitive insights: 1) decoding novel visual
categories from human brain activity is practically possible with good
accuracy; 2) decoding models using the combination of visual and linguistic
features perform much better than those using either of them alone; 3) visual
perception may be accompanied by linguistic influences to represent the
semantics of visual stimuli. Code and data: https://github.com/ChangdeDu/BraVL.

structure of dynamic variables, including the Pauli matrices for finite-level

the system to the external bosonic fields depend linearly on the system
variables. The fields are represented by quantum Wiener processes which drive
the system dynamics in the form of a quasilinear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum
stochastic differential equation whose drift vector and dispersion matrix are
affine and linear functions of the system variables. This quasilinearity leads
to a tractable evolution of the two-point commutator matrix of the system
variables (and their multi-point mixed moments in the case of vacuum input
fields) involving time-ordered operator exponentials. The resulting exponential
decay in the two-point commutation relations is a manifestation of quantum
decoherence, caused by the dissipative system-field interaction and making the
system lose specific unitary dynamics features which it would have in isolation
from the environment. We quantify the decoherence in terms of the rate of the
commutation relations decay and apply system theoretic and matrix analytic
techniques, such as algebraic Lyapunov inequalities and spectrum perturbation
results, to the study of the asymptotic behaviour of the related Lyapunov
exponents in the presence of a small scaling parameter in the system-field
coupling. These findings are illustrated for finite-level quantum systems (and
their interconnections through a direct energy coupling) with multichannel
external fields and the Pauli matrices as internal variables.

distributions are constructed, where both WL shear and IA signals are included.
Convergence reconstruction and peak statistics are then performed for these
samples. Our results show that the IA effects on peak abundances mainly consist
of two aspects. One is the additional contribution from IA to the shape noise.
The other is from the satellite IA that can affect the peak signals from their
host clusters significantly. The latter depends on the level of inclusion in a
shear sample of the satellite galaxies of the clusters that contribute to WL
peaks, and thus is sensitive to the redshift distribution of source galaxies.
We pay particular attention to satellite IA and adjust it artificially in the
simulations to analyze the dependence of the satellite IA impacts on its
strength. This information can potentially be incorporated into the modeling of
WL peak abundances, especially for high peaks physically originated from
massive clusters of galaxies, and thus to mitigate the IA systematics on the

ambient medium and on the grain sizes. For a low-density contrast of $100$,
e.g., $5\,$nm silicate grains are completely destroyed while the survival
fraction of $1\,\mu$m grains is $86\,$per cent. For a high-density contrast of
$1000$, $95\,$per cent of the $5\,$nm grains survive while the survival
fraction of $1\,\mu$m grains is $26\,$per cent. Alternative clump sizes or dust
materials (carbon) have non-negligible effects on the survival rate but have a
lower impact compared to density contrast, magnetic field strength, and grain
size.

challenge to control biomolecules to translocate through SS-nanopore,
particularly for the protein with complex conformations and different charges.
Towards this problem, we developed a DNA scaffold carrier assisted strategy to
help protein translocation through SS-nanopore, thus facilitating the target
protein detection. Taking advantages of a DNA carrier loading effect, the
current signal to noise ratios are significantly improved. Our proposed method

among organizations to facilitate secure collaborative training over siloed
data. In vertical FL (VFL), participants hold disjoint features of the same set
of sample instances. Among them, only one has labels. This participant, known
as the active party, initiates the training and interacts with the other
participants, known as the passive parties. Despite the increasing adoption of
VFL, it remains largely unknown if and how the active party can extract feature
data from the passive party, especially when training deep neural network (DNN)
models.
  This paper makes the first attempt to study the feature security problem of
DNN training in VFL. We consider a DNN model partitioned between active and
passive parties, where the latter only holds a subset of the input layer and
exhibits some categorical features of binary values. Using a reduction from the
Exact Cover problem, we prove that reconstructing those binary features is
NP-hard. Through analysis, we demonstrate that, unless the feature dimension is
exceedingly large, it remains feasible, both theoretically and practically, to
launch a reconstruction attack with an efficient search-based algorithm that
prevails over current feature protection techniques. To address this problem,
we develop a novel feature protection scheme against the reconstruction attack
that effectively misleads the search to some pre-specified random values. With
an extensive set of experiments, we show that our protection scheme sustains
the feature reconstruction attack in various VFL applications at no expense of
accuracy loss.

are hardly studied compared to their homogeneous counterparts, in a complex
geometry, made of staircases connected by a platform where pedestrians rotate,
and over a wide range of densities. In light of our field observations at a
training school in China, we develop a semi-continuous model which
quantitatively reproduces the collective dynamics observed empirically and
enables us to assess some guidance strategies to improve egress efficiency. In
this model, which extends the optimal step approach, adults and children are
described as ellipses with prescribed relative positions that evolve by
successive steps handled by an event-driven algorithm, along a spontaneous
semi-circular path on the platform, but may deviate from it in crowded
conditions by selecting their preferred next positions. In line with the
observations, most pairs walk side by side overall and only a small fraction
sometimes make a detour to avoid queuing.Turning to the guidance strategies, we
find that promoting front-back pairing may increase the flow, while urging
people to make more detours may be counterproductive. Perhaps even more
relevantly, the intuitive measure consisting in desynchronizing the flows from
the different floors by shifting the ends of classes succeeds in reducing the
egress time by at least 10%.

classical machine learning. In machine learning, a difficult problem is how to
learn a model with high robustness and strong generalization ability from a
limited feature space. Combining multiple models as base learners, ensemble
learning (EL) can effectively improve the accuracy, generalization ability, and
robustness of the final model. The key to EL lies in two aspects, the
performance of base learners and the choice of the combination strategy.
Recently, quantum EL (QEL) has been studied. However, existing combination
strategies in QEL are inadequate in considering the accuracy and variance among
base learners. This paper presents a hybrid EL framework that combines quantum
and classical advantages. More importantly, we propose an efficient combination
strategy for improving the accuracy of classification in the framework. We
verify the feasibility and efficiency of our framework and strategy by using
the MNIST dataset. Simulation results show that the hybrid EL framework with
our combination strategy not only has a higher accuracy and lower variance than
the single model without the ensemble, but also has a better accuracy than the
majority voting and the weighted voting strategies in most cases.

unlabeled data pool and annotate them to expand the labeled dataset under a

samples, which are known to be effective in improving model performance.
However, AL literature often overlooks training dynamics (TD), defined as the
ever-changing model behavior during optimization via stochastic gradient
descent, even though other areas of literature have empirically shown that TD
provides important clues for measuring the sample uncertainty. In this paper,
we propose a novel AL method, Training Dynamics for Active Learning (TiDAL),

tracking the TD of all the large-scale unlabeled data is impractical, TiDAL
utilizes an additional prediction module that learns the TD of labeled data. To

including into the training set negative samples that a classifier learns to

differences by comparing SGX assistance for malware with non-SGX malware (i.e.,

original multi-view data into compact features perceiving its nonlinear
structures. Considering the large semantic gap of data from different

joint semantic space, namely the embedded compact features are passed through
multiple self-expression layers to learn the subspace representations,
respectively. In order to enhance the discriminability and efficiently excavate
the complementarity of various subspace representations, we use the contrastive
strategy to maximize the similarity between positive pairs while differentiate
negative pairs. Thus, a weighted fusion scheme is developed to initially learn
a consistent affinity matrix. Furthermore, we employ the graph regularization
to encode the local geometric structure within varying subspaces for further
fine-tuning the appropriate affinities between instances. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct a large number of comparative
experiments on eight challenge datasets, the experimental results show that
SCMC outperforms existing shallow and deep multi-view clustering methods.

fitness landscapes, driven by mutations and constrained by incremental fitness
selection. It is well known that epistasis shapes the ruggedness of the
landscape's surface, outlining their topography (with high-fitness peaks
separated by valleys of lower fitness genotypes). However, within the strong
selection weak mutation (SSWM) limit, once an adaptive walk reaches a local
peak, natural selection restricts passage through downstream paths and hampers
any possibility of reaching higher fitness values. Here, in addition to the
widely used point mutations, we introduce a minimal model of sequence
inversions to simulate adaptive walks. We use the well known NK model to
instantiate rugged landscapes. We show that adaptive walks can reach higher
fitness values through inversion mutations, which, compared to point mutations,
allows the evolutionary process to escape local fitness peaks. To elucidate the
effects of this chromosomal rearrangement, we use a graph-theoretical
representation of accessible mutants and show how new evolutionary paths are
uncovered. The present model suggests a simple mechanistic rationale to analyse
escapes from local fitness peaks in molecular evolution driven by (intragenic)
structural inversions and reveals some consequences of the limits of point
mutations for simulations of molecular evolution.

focus on extending them for handling videos. Here, the main challenge is how to
(a) alleviate a compute-inefficiency in training CNRs to (b) achieve
high-quality video encoding while (c) maintaining the parameter-efficiency. To
meet all requirements (a), (b), and (c) simultaneously, we propose neural video
representations with learnable positional features (NVP), a novel CNR by
introducing ""learnable positional features"" that effectively amortize a video
as latent codes. Specifically, we first present a CNR architecture based on
designing 2D latent keyframes to learn the common video contents across each
spatio-temporal axis, which dramatically improves all of those three
requirements. Then, we propose to utilize existing powerful image and video
codecs as a compute-/memory-efficient compression procedure of latent codes. We
demonstrate the superiority of NVP on the popular UVG benchmark; compared with
prior arts, NVP not only trains 2 times faster (less than 5 minutes) but also
exceeds their encoding quality as 34.07$\rightarrow$34.57 (measured with the
PSNR metric), even using $>$8 times fewer parameters. We also show intriguing
properties of NVP, e.g., video inpainting, video frame interpolation, etc.

models. While recent advances have produced algorithms that fully optimize
sparse decision trees for prediction, that work does not address policy design,
because the algorithms cannot handle weighted data samples. Specifically, they
rely on the discreteness of the loss function, which means that real-valued
weights cannot be directly used. For example, none of the existing techniques
produce policies that incorporate inverse propensity weighting on individual
data points. We present three algorithms for efficient sparse weighted decision
tree optimization. The first approach directly optimizes the weighted loss
function; however, it tends to be computationally inefficient for large
datasets. Our second approach, which scales more efficiently, transforms
weights to integer values and uses data duplication to transform the weighted
decision tree optimization problem into an unweighted (but larger) counterpart.
Our third algorithm, which scales to much larger datasets, uses a randomized
procedure that samples each data point with a probability proportional to its
weight. We present theoretical bounds on the error of the two fast methods and
show experimentally that these methods can be two orders of magnitude faster
than the direct optimization of the weighted loss, without losing significant
accuracy.

improve the performance. The experiments are conducted on various benchmark

However, in many complex algorithms, there may exist different types of

for classic DAC which uses a single-agent RL policy. In this paper, we aim to
address this issue and propose multi-agent DAC (MA-DAC), with one agent working

a contextual multi-agent Markov decision process and solves it by a cooperative

Experimental results show the effectiveness of MA-DAC in not only achieving
superior performance compared with other configuration tuning approaches based

for downstream tasks is extracted and transmitted. However, most of the
existing SC works only transmit analog information on the AWGN channel and
cannot be directly used for digital channels. SNN-SC fills this gap by using
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to extract and transmit semantic information.
Since the outputs of SNNs are binary spikes, SNN-SC can be directly applied to
digital channels. In SNN-SC, a new spiking neuron is proposed to help the cloud
recover binary semantic information into informative floating-point features.
Furthermore, we improve the performance of SNN-SC by maximizing the entropy of

transition dipole matrix element of the two bands involved. It follows that
this invariant provides a natural topological lower bound on the number of
momenta in the Brillouin zone for which an electron cannot be excited from one
Bloch band to the other by absorbing a photon.

classification of the running time of the homomorphism problem with respect to
the clique-width of $G$ (denoted $\operatorname{cw}$) for virtually all choices
of $H$ under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis. In particular, we identify
a property of $H$ called the signature number $s(H)$ and show that for each

$\mathcal{O}^*(s(H)^{\operatorname{cw}})$. Crucially, we then show that this
algorithm can be used to obtain essentially tight upper bounds. Specifically,
we provide a reduction that yields matching lower bounds for each $H$ that is
either a projective core or a graph admitting a factorization with additional
properties -- allowing us to cover all possible target graphs under

stripy antiferromagnets, and all possible sign combinations $(\tau_1, \tau_2)$

Based on density-matrix renormalization group calculations, we find that, with
finite $t_2$ and specific sign combinations $(\tau_1, \tau_2)$, the
quasi-long-range superconductivity order can always be achieved, regardless of
the nature of the parent spin backgrounds. Besides specific hopping signs
$(\tau_1, \tau_2)$, these superconductivity phases in triangular lattices are
commonly characterized by short-ranged spin correlations and two charges per
stripe. In the robust superconductivity phase realized at larger $t_2/t_1$,
flipping the signs $\tau_2$ and $\tau_1$ gives rise to the stripe phase without
strong pairing and pseudogap-like phase without Cooper-pair phase coherence,
respectively. Interestingly, the roles of the two hopping signs are switched at
smaller $t_2/t_1$. Moreover, different sign combinations $(\tau_1, \tau_2)$
would stabilize distinct phases including superconductivity, charge density
waves, spin density waves, and pseudogap-like phases accordingly. Our findings
suggest the important role of charge kinetic energy in realizing

to model its objective function, is popular for black-box optimization.
However, due to the limitations of GPs, BO underperforms in some problems such
as those with categorical, high-dimensional or image inputs. To this end,
recent works have used the highly expressive neural networks (NNs) as the
surrogate model and derived theoretical guarantees using the theory of neural
tangent kernel (NTK). However, these works suffer from the limitations of the
requirement to invert an extremely large parameter matrix and the restriction
to the sequential (rather than batch) setting. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce two algorithms based on the Thompson sampling (TS) policy named
Sample-Then-Optimize Batch Neural TS (STO-BNTS) and STO-BNTS-Linear. To choose
an input query, we only need to train an NN (resp. a linear model) and then
choose the query by maximizing the trained NN (resp. linear model), which is
equivalently sampled from the GP posterior with the NTK as the kernel function.
As a result, our algorithms sidestep the need to invert the large parameter
matrix yet still preserve the validity of the TS policy. Next, we derive regret
upper bounds for our algorithms with batch evaluations, and use insights from
batch BO and NTK to show that they are asymptotically no-regret under certain
conditions. Finally, we verify their empirical effectiveness using practical
AutoML and reinforcement learning experiments.

known that the reduction of $r_s$ can be compensated by the increase of $H_0$,
while the same is true for the standard rulers $k_{\rm{eq}}$. Adding extra
radiational component to the early universe can reduce $k_{\rm{eq}}$. The
addition of early dark energy (EDE), however, tends to increase $k_{\rm{eq}}$.
We perform $k_{\rm{eq}}$- and $r_s$-based analyses in both the EDE model and
the Wess-Zumino Dark Radiation (WZDR) model. In the latter case we find $\Delta
H_0 = 0.4$ between the $r_s$- and $k_{\rm{eq}}$-based datasets, while in the
former case we find $\Delta H_0 = 1.2$. This result suggests that the dark

  Scene Reconstruction",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a novel neural surface reconstruction method called NeuralRoom for
reconstructing room-sized indoor scenes directly from a set of 2D images.
Recently, implicit neural representations have become a promising way to
reconstruct surfaces from multiview images due to their high-quality results
and simplicity. However, implicit neural representations usually cannot
reconstruct indoor scenes well because they suffer severe shape-radiance
ambiguity. We assume that the indoor scene consists of texture-rich and flat
texture-less regions. In texture-rich regions, the multiview stereo can obtain
accurate results. In the flat area, normal estimation networks usually obtain a
good normal estimation. Based on the above observations, we reduce the possible
spatial variation range of implicit neural surfaces by reliable geometric
priors to alleviate shape-radiance ambiguity. Specifically, we use multiview
stereo results to limit the NeuralRoom optimization space and then use reliable
geometric priors to guide NeuralRoom training. Then the NeuralRoom would
produce a neural scene representation that can render an image consistent with
the input training images. In addition, we propose a smoothing method called
perturbation-residual restrictions to improve the accuracy and completeness of
the flat region, which assumes that the sampling points in a local surface
should have the same normal and similar distance to the observation center.
Experiments on the ScanNet dataset show that our method can reconstruct the
texture-less area of indoor scenes while maintaining the accuracy of detail. We
also apply NeuralRoom to more advanced multiview reconstruction algorithms and
significantly improve their reconstruction quality.

investigate the relationship between the structure of metallic melts (Pb/Al)
and the abnormal viscosity change. Although absolute value of the surface
energy does not change significantly with temperature, the Wulff shape changed
evidently. When temperature raise to 975K, Pb(321) surface that has the highest
interaction strength completely disappears, while the abnormal viscosity drop
happens at the same temperature range. Oppositely, Al(100) surface that has the
lowest interaction strength disappears when temperature is higher than 1075K,
and at the same temperature range, the abnormal viscosity rise has been
observed. The abnormal viscosity drop corresponds to the disappearance of
surface with the highest interaction strength (Pb(321) surface), while the rise
one corresponds to the disappearance of surface with the lowest adsorption
energy (Al(100) surface). All evidence indicates that the uniformity between
abnormal viscosity change and the change of Wulff shape is not a coincidence. A
possible mechanism of the abnormal viscosity change is that it caused by the
significant structure change of cluster (short range ordering) in the metallic
melts.

traditionally been applied to image, voice and similar data, but recently it
has started to draw attention from domains including financial services where
the data is predominantly tabular. However, the work on tabular data has not
yet considered potential attacks, in particular attacks using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), which have been successfully applied to FL for
non-tabular data. This paper is the first to explore leakage of private data in
Federated Learning systems that process tabular data. We design a Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs)-based attack model which can be deployed on a
malicious client to reconstruct data and its properties from other
participants. As a side-effect of considering tabular data, we are able to
statistically assess the efficacy of the attack (without relying on human
observation such as done for FL for images). We implement our attack model in a
recently developed generic FL software framework for tabular data processing.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack
model, thus suggesting that further research is required to counter GAN-based
privacy attacks.

on the threshold of a massive scalar field's superradiant instability regime
(time-growing quasi-bound states) and beyond (time-decaying quasi-bound
states). By taking a novel type of rotating hollow regular black hole proposed
by Simpson and Visser which unlike its standard rivals has an asymptotically
Minkowski core, we address this question. The metric has a minimal extension
relative to the standard Kerr, originating from a single regularization
parameter $\ell$, with length dimension. We show with the inclusion of the
regularization length scale $\ell$ into the Kerr spacetime, without affecting
the standard superradiant instability regime, the timescale of scalar cloud
formation gets shorter. Since the scalar cloud after its formation, via energy
dissipation, can play the role of a continuum source for gravitational waves,
such a reduction in the instability growth time improves the phenomenological
detection prospects of new physics because the shorter the time, the more
astrophysically important.

sequencing technologies has greatly increased the number of genomic projects.
As a result, there is a growing need for better assembly and assembly
validation methods. One promising idea is to use heterogeneous data in assembly
projects. Optical Mapping (OM) is beneficial in validating genomic assemblies,
correction and scaffolding. Single raw OM read describes a DNA molecule's long
fragment, up to 1Mbp. Raw OM data from the same genome could be assembled to
create consensus maps that span an entire chromosome.
  The assembly process is computationally hard because of the large number of
errors in input data.
  This work describes a new algorithm and computer program to assemble OM reads
without a reference genome. In our algorithm, we explored binary representation
for genome maps. We focused on the efficiency of data structures and algorithms
and scale on parallel platforms. The algorithm consists of several steps, of
which the most important are : (1) conversion of the restriction maps into
binary strings, (2) detection of overlaps between restriction maps, (3)
determining the layout of restriction maps set, (4) creation of consensus
genomic maps. Our algorithm deals with optical mapping data with low error
levels but fails with high-level error reads.
  We developed a software library, console application and module for Python
language. The approach presented in this paper proved to be faster than a
dynamic programming approach and performed well on error-free data. It could be
used as a step of \textit{de~novo} assembly pipelines or to detect
misassemblies.The software is freely available in a public repository under GNU

recognition attacks, existing methods typically generate the l_p-norm

high vulnerability to denoising defense models. In this work, instead of
performing perturbations on the low-level pixels, we propose to generate
attacks through perturbing on the high-level semantics to improve attack

Attributes (Adv-Attribute), is designed to generate inconspicuous and
transferable attacks on face recognition, which crafts the adversarial noise
and adds it into different attributes based on the guidance of the difference
in face recognition features from the target. Moreover, the importance-aware

Physical laws abide by symmetry, which is a vital inductive bias accounting for

equivariance in practice when symmetry is partially broken by gravity. 2)
Objects in the physical world possess diverse shapes, sizes, and properties,

introduces a new subequivariant object-aware message passing for learning

properties of these two numbers are quite different. We consider real analogues
of monotone double Hurwitz numbers and study the asymptotics for these real
analogues. The key ingredient is an interpretation of real tropical covers with
arbitrary splittings as factorizations in the symmetric group which generalizes
the result from Guay-Paquet, Markwig, and Rau (Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN,
2016(1):258-293, 2016). By using the above interpretation, we consider three
types of real analogues of monotone double Hurwitz numbers: real monotone
double Hurwitz numbers relative to simple splittings, relative to arbitrary
splittings and real mixed double Hurwitz numbers. Under certain conditions, we
find lower bounds for these real analogues, and obtain logarithmic asymptotics
for real monotone double Hurwitz numbers relative to arbitrary splittings and
real mixed double Hurwitz numbers. In particular, under given conditions real
mixed double Hurwitz numbers are logarithmically equivalent to complex double
Hurwitz numbers. We construct a family of real tropical covers and use them to

techniques to alleviate the temporal redundancy of videos. Though effective,
sparse sampling still suffers inter-modal redundancy: visual redundancy and
textual redundancy. Compared with highly generalized text, sparsely sampled
frames usually contain text-independent portions, called visual redundancy.
Sparse sampling is also likely to miss important frames corresponding to some
text portions, resulting in textual redundancy. Inter-modal redundancy leads to
a mismatch of video and text information, hindering the model from better
learning the shared semantics across modalities. To alleviate it, we propose
Redundancy-aware Video-language Pre-training. We design a redundancy
measurement of video patches and text tokens by calculating the cross-modal
minimum dis-similarity. Then, we penalize the highredundant video patches and

crucial task in many image processing applications ever since such data could
be generated. Most existing applications nowadays, specifically CNNs, make use
of voxelwise classification systems which need to be trained on a large number
of annotated training volumes. However, in many practical applications such
data sets are seldom available and the generation of annotations is
time-consuming and cumbersome. In this paper, we introduce a novel voxelwise
segmentation method based on active learning on geometric features. Our method
uses interactively provided seed points to train a voxelwise classifier based
entirely on local information. The combination of an ad hoc incorporation of
domain knowledge and local processing results in a flexible yet efficient
segmentation method that is applicable to three-dimensional volumes without
size restrictions. We illustrate the potential and flexibility of our approach
by applying it to selected computed tomography scans where we perform different
segmentation tasks to scans from different domains and of different sizes.

concept simply based on its language description. Empowering deep learning with
this ability undoubtedly enables the neural network to handle complex vision
tasks, e.g., object detection, without collecting and annotating real images.
To this end, this paper introduces a novel challenging learning paradigm
Imaginary-Supervised Object Detection (ISOD), where neither real images nor
manual annotations are allowed for training object detectors. To resolve this
challenge, we propose ImaginaryNet, a framework to synthesize images by
combining pretrained language model and text-to-image synthesis model. Given a
class label, the language model is used to generate a full description of a
scene with a target object, and the text-to-image model deployed to generate a
photo-realistic image. With the synthesized images and class labels, weakly
supervised object detection can then be leveraged to accomplish ISOD. By
gradually introducing real images and manual annotations, ImaginaryNet can
collaborate with other supervision settings to further boost detection
performance. Experiments show that ImaginaryNet can (i) obtain about 70%
performance in ISOD compared with the weakly supervised counterpart of the same
backbone trained on real data, (ii) significantly improve the baseline while
achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance by incorporating
ImaginaryNet with other supervision settings.

(DNN) model against the malicious altered data. These attacks may have
catastrophic effects on DNN models but are indistinguishable for a human being.
For example, an external attack can modify an image adding noises invisible for
a human eye, but a DNN model misclassified the image. A key objective for
developing robust DNN models is to use a learning algorithm that is fast but
can also give model that is robust against different types of adversarial
attacks. Especially for adversarial training, enormously long training times
are needed for obtaining high accuracy under many different types of
adversarial samples generated using different adversarial attack techniques.
  This paper aims at accelerating the adversarial training to enable fast
development of robust DNN models against adversarial attacks. The general
method for improving the training performance is the hyperparameters
fine-tuning, where the learning rate is one of the most crucial
hyperparameters. By modifying its shape (the value over time) and value during
the training, we can obtain a model robust to adversarial attacks faster than
standard training.
  First, we conduct experiments on two different datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100),
exploring various techniques. Then, this analysis is leveraged to develop a
novel fast training methodology, AccelAT, which automatically adjusts the
learning rate for different epochs based on the accuracy gradient. The
experiments show comparable results with the related works, and in several
experiments, the adversarial training of DNNs using our AccelAT framework is
conducted up to 2 times faster than the existing techniques. Thus, our findings
boost the speed of adversarial training in an era in which security and
performance are fundamental optimization objectives in DNN-based applications.

  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2108.06967",,,,"cs.CR math.GR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Let $S$ be a pool of $s$ parties and Alice be the dealer. In this paper, we
propose a scheme that allows the dealer to encrypt messages in such a way that
only one authorized coalition of parties (which the dealer chooses depending on
the message) can decrypt. At the setup stage, each of the parties involved in
the process receives an individual key from the dealer. To decrypt information,
an authorized coalition of parties must work together to use their keys. Based
on this scheme, we propose a threshold encryption scheme. For a given message
$f$ the dealer can choose any threshold $m = m(f).$ More precisely, any set of
parties of size at least $m$ can evaluate $f$; any set of size less than $m$
cannot do this. Similarly, the distribution of keys among the included parties
can be done in such a way that authorized coalitions of parties will be given
the opportunity to put a collective digital signature on any documents. This
primitive can be generalized to the dynamic setting, where any user can
dynamically join the pool $S$. In this case the new user receives a key from
the dealer. Also any user can leave the pool $S$. In both cases, already
distributed keys of other users do not change. The main feature of the proposed
schemes is that for a given $s$ the keys are distributed once and can be used
multiple times.
  The proposed scheme is based on the idea of hidden multipliers in encryption.
As a platform, one can use both multiplicative groups of finite fields and
groups of invertible elements of commutative rings, in particular,
multiplicative groups of residue rings. We propose two versions of this scheme.

significantly impacts the performance of a system with large signal bandwidths.
Standard hybrid beamforming (HBF) transceiver architectures based on
frequency-independent phase shifters (PS-HBF) are sensitive to the phases and
physical directions with limited capability to compensate for the detrimental
effects of the beam squint. Motivated by the fact that switches are
phase-independent and more power/cost efficient than phase shifters, we
consider the switch-based HBF (SW-HBF) for wideband large-scale multiple-input
multiple-output systems in this paper. We first derive a closed-form expression
of the beam squint ratio of the PS-HBF architecture and compare the expected
array gains of both SW-HBF and PS-HBF architectures. The results show that
SW-HBF is more robust to the beam squint effect. We then focus on the SW-HBF
design to maximize the system spectral efficiency. The formulated problem is a
non-convex mixed-integer program. We propose three efficient suboptimal SW-HBF
algorithms based on tabu search and projected gradient ascend. Simulations show
that the proposed SW-HBF schemes achieve near-optimal performance with low
complexity. Furthermore, they attain up to 26% spectral efficiency and 90%
energy efficiency enhancements compared to the PS-HBF scheme.

experiment design (ED) and a novel method in populationwide supervised feature
selection (FS). Optimal ED, the choice of sampling points under constraints of
limited acquisition-time, arises in a wide variety of scientific and
engineering contexts. However the continuous optimization used in classical
approaches depend on a-priori parameter choices and challenging non-convex
optimization landscapes. This paper proposes to replace this strategy with a
subsampling-task paradigm, analogous to populationwide supervised FS. In
particular, we introduce JOFSTO, which performs JOint Feature Selection and
Task Optimization. JOFSTO jointly optimizes two coupled networks: one for
feature scoring, which provides the ED, the other for execution of a downstream
task or process. Unlike most FS problems, e.g. selecting protein expressions
for classification, ED problems typically select from highly correlated
globally informative candidates rather than seeking a small number of highly
informative features among many uninformative features. JOFSTO's construction
efficiently identifies potentially correlated, but effective subsets and
returns a trained task network. We demonstrate the approach using parameter
estimation and mapping problems in clinically-relevant applications in
quantitative MRI and in hyperspectral imaging. Results from simulations and
empirical data show the subsampling-task paradigm strongly outperforms
classical ED, and within our paradigm, JOFSTO outperforms state-of-the-art
supervised FS techniques. JOFSTO extends immediately to wider image-based ED
problems and other scenarios where the design must be specified globally across
large numbers of acquisitions. Code will be released.

regarding their formation and evolution environments. Two of the most
well-studied ultra-hot Jupiters are WASP-76b and WASP-121b, with multiple
detected chemical species and strong signatures of their atmospheric dynamics.
We take a new look at these two exceptional ultra-hot Jupiters by reanalyzing
the transit observations taken with ESPRESSO at the Very Large Telescope and
attempt to detect additional species. To extract the planetary spectra of the
two targets, we corrected for the telluric absorption and removed the stellar
spectrum contributions. We then exploited new synthetic templates that were
specifically designed for ultra-hot Jupiters in combination with the
cross-correlation technique to unveil species that remained undetected by
previous analyses. We add a novel detection of Ba+ to the known atmospheric
compositions of WASP-76b and WASP-121b, the heaviest species detected to date
in any exoplanetary atmosphere, with additional new detections of Co and Sr+
and a tentative detection of Ti+ for WASP-121b. We also confirm the presence of
Ca+, Cr, Fe, H, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, and V on both WASP-76b and WASP-121b, with the
addition of Ca, Fe+, and Ni for the latter. Finally, we also confirm the clear
asymmetric absorption feature of Ca+ on WASP-121b, with an excess absorption at
the bluer wavelengths and an effective planet radius beyond the Roche lobe.
This indicates that the signal may arise from the escape of planetary

correlation between the CaII H&K and H$\alpha$ indices with the aim of
improving the H$\alpha$ index to better identify and model the signals coming
from activity variability. We used a sample of 152 FGK dwarfs observed with
HARPS for more than 13 years with enough cadence to be able to detect
rotational modulations and cycles in activity proxies. We calculated the CaII
H&K and H$\alpha$ activity indices using a range of bandwidths for H$\alpha$
between 0.1 and 2.0 Ang. We studied the correlation between the indices time
series at long and short timescales and analysed the impact of stellar
parameters, activity level and variability on the correlations. The correlation
between CaII H&K and H$\alpha$ both at short and long timespans is maximised
when using narrow H$\alpha$ bandwidths, with a maximum at 0.6 Ang. For some
inactive stars, as the activity level increases, the flux in the H$\alpha$ line
core increases while the flux in the line wings decreases as the line becomes
shallower and broader. The balance between these fluxes can cause stars to show
the negative correlations observed in the literature when using a wide
bandwidth on H$\alpha$. These anti-correlations may become positive
correlations if using the 0.6 Ang bandwidth. Calculating the H$\alpha$ index
using a bandpass of 0.6 Ang maximises the correlation between CaII H&K and
H$\alpha$ both at short and long timescales. On the other hand, the use of the
broader 1.6 Ang, generally used in exoplanet detection to identify stellar
activity signals, degrades the signal by including the flux in the line wings.
In face to these results we strongly recommend the use of a 0.6 Ang bandwidth
when computing the H$\alpha$ index for the identification of activity
rotational modulation and magnetic cycle signals in solar-type stars.

of investigating stellar interior with mixed modes. The structural variations
induced by the discontinuity of the chemical composition left behind during the
first dredge--up is an important feature in the stellar mid-layers located
between the hydrogen-burning shell and the base of the convective zone of red
giants, as the mixed-mode properties can be significantly affected by these
variations. In this paper, the contributing factors to variations of the
mixed-mode coupling factor, $q$, are discussed with stellar models. In general,
the structural variations give rise to a subtle displacement in the Lamb
frequency and a sharp change in the buoyancy frequency, which lead to
variations in the value of $q$ computed using the asymptotic formalisms that
assuming a smooth background free of structural variations. The impact of these
two factors can be felt in detectable mixed modes in low-luminosity red giants.
Furthermore, the different nature of variations of the two characteristic
frequencies with radius near the base of the convective zone, produces a sudden
increase in $q$ in evolved red giants. This is followed by a quick drop in $q$
as the star evolves further along the red giant branch.

alpha mattes, and direct low-level features combination is usually explored to

different-level feature aggregation for better pixel-wise opacity perception.
In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Hierarchical and Progressive Attention
Matting Network (HAttMatting++), which can better predict the opacity of the
foreground from single RGB images without additional input. Specifically, we
utilize channel-wise attention to distill pyramidal features and employ spatial
attention at different levels to filter appearance cues. This progressive
attention mechanism can estimate alpha mattes from adaptive semantics and
semantics-indicated boundaries. We also introduce a hybrid loss function fusing
Structural SIMilarity (SSIM), Mean Square Error (MSE), Adversarial loss, and
sentry supervision to guide the network to further improve the overall
foreground structure. Besides, we construct a large-scale and challenging image
matting dataset comprised of 59, 600 training images and 1000 test images (a
total of 646 distinct foreground alpha mattes), which can further improve the
robustness of our hierarchical and progressive aggregation model. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed HAttMatting++ can capture
sophisticated foreground structures and achieve state-of-the-art performance

classes given a few annotated support samples. With a rethink of recent
advances, we find that the current FSS framework has deviated far from the
supervised segmentation framework: Given the deep features, FSS methods
typically use an intricate decoder to perform sophisticated pixel-wise
matching, while the supervised segmentation methods use a simple linear
classification head. Due to the intricacy of the decoder and its matching
pipeline, it is not easy to follow such an FSS framework. This paper revives
the straightforward framework of ""feature extractor $+$ linear classification
head"" and proposes a novel Feature-Proxy Transformer (FPTrans) method, in which
the ""proxy"" is the vector representing a semantic class in the linear
classification head. FPTrans has two keypoints for learning discriminative
features and representative proxies: 1) To better utilize the limited support
samples, the feature extractor makes the query interact with the support
features from the bottom to top layers using a novel prompting strategy. 2)
FPTrans uses multiple local background proxies (instead of a single one)
because the background is not homogeneous and may contain some novel foreground
regions. These two keypoints are easily integrated into the vision transformer
backbone with the prompting mechanism in the transformer. Given the learned
features and proxies, FPTrans directly compares their cosine similarity for
segmentation. Although the framework is straightforward, we show that FPTrans
achieves competitive FSS accuracy on par with state-of-the-art decoder-based
methods.

proposed to rule out the samples with high possibility to be noisy from

homogeneous records of sunspot observations that span more than a century
(1904-2017). Interestingly, these observations (originally recorded in
photographic plates/films) were taken with the same setup over this entire time
period which makes this data unique and best suitable for long-term solar
variability studies. A large part of this data, between 1921-2011, were
digitized earlier and a catalog containing the detected sunspot parameters
(e.g., area and location) was published in Mandal et al.(2017). In this
article, we extend the earlier catalog by including new sets of data between
1904-1921 and 2011-2017. To this end, we digitize and calibrate these new
datasets which include resolving the issue of random image orientation. We fix
this by comparing the KoSO images with co-temporal data from Royal Greenwich
Observatory. Following that, a semi-automated sunspot detection and automated
umbra detection algorithm are implemented onto these calibrated images to
detect sunspots and umbra. Additionally, during this catalog updation, we also
filled data gaps in the existing KoSO sunspot catalog (1921-2011) by virtue of
re-calibrating the 'rouge' plates. This updated sunspot area series covering
nearly 115 years (1904-2017) are being made available to the community and will
be a unique source to study the long term variability of the Sun

Based on this estimated energy, adaptive unitary operations are applied such
that only the targeted energy eigenstates are fixed points of the evolution. In
this way, the system is deterministically driven towards the desired state. The
nonlinear nature of the QND measurement, which allows for producing
interactions between systems, is explicitly derived in terms of measurement
operators. We show that for suitable interaction times, single qubit QND
Hamiltonians can be converted to effective multi-qubit imaginary time
operations. We illustrate our techniques with the example of preparing a four
qubit cluster state, which is prepared using only collective single qubit QND
measurements and single qubit adaptive operations.

scene text recognition. However, due to the complex degradation in natural
scenes, recovering high-resolution texts from the low-resolution inputs is
ambiguous and challenging. Existing methods mainly leverage deep neural
networks trained with pixel-wise losses designed for natural image
reconstruction, which ignore the unique character characteristics of texts. A
few works proposed content-based losses. However, they only focus on text
recognizers' accuracy, while the reconstructed images may still be ambiguous to
humans. Further, they often have weak generalizability to handle cross
languages. To this end, we present TATSR, a Text-Aware Text Super-Resolution
framework, which effectively learns the unique text characteristics using
Criss-Cross Transformer Blocks (CCTBs) and a novel Content Perceptual (CP)
Loss. The CCTB extracts vertical and horizontal content information from text
images by two orthogonal transformers, respectively. The CP Loss supervises the
text reconstruction with content semantics by multi-scale text recognition
features, which effectively incorporates content awareness into the framework.
Extensive experiments on various language datasets demonstrate that TATSR
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both recognition accuracy and
human perception.

  Lately, methods have been developed to address the aforementioned challenges

the optimal transport cost by its regularized version using an entropy penalty
on the transport plan. The use of such a regularization has a potentially
significant smoothing effect on the resulting estimators. In this work, we
investigate its potential benefits on the approximation and estimation

discuss how entropic regularization may reach, at a lowest computational cost,
statistical performances that are comparable to those of un-regularized
Wasserstein estimators in statistical learning problems involving

such velocity distributions have been modeled by a two-temperature Maxwell
distribution. In this paper, I propose a model based on collisional energy
cascade, which has been studied in the field of granular materials. In the
collisional energy cascade, a particle ensemble undergoes energy input at the
high-energy region, entropy production by elastic collisions among particles,
and energy dissipation. For radical atoms, energy input may be caused by the
Franck-Condon energy of molecular dissociation or charge-exchange collision
with hot ions, and the input energy is eventually dissipated by collisions with
the walls. I show that the steady-state velocity distribution in the
collisional energy cascade is approximated by the generalized Mittag-Leffler
distribution, which is a one-parameter extension of the Maxwell distribution.
This parameter indicates the degree of the nonthermality and is related to the
relative importance of energy dissipation over entropy production. This model
is compared with a direct molecular dynamics simulation for a simplified
gaseous system with energy input and dissipative wall collisions, as well as

and the pressure waves generated by the pre-ignition front tend to synchronize
in the chamber, increasing the reactivity of the system in a periodic manner.
The average of the oscillating temperature is greater in the cold-spot,
compared to all other points ahead of the flame. As a result, the rate
constants of the most important reactions are larger there, leading to a more
reactive state that accelerates the dynamics of the cold-spot and to its
autoignition.

towards backward-compatible model upgrades to get rid of backfilling. It is
workable but leaves the new model in a dilemma between new feature
discriminativeness and new-to-old compatibility due to the undifferentiated
compatibility constraints. In this work, we propose Darwinian Model Upgrades

old-to-new heritable knowledge is measured by old feature discriminativeness,
and the gallery features, especially those of poor quality, are evolved in a
lightweight manner to become more adaptive in the new latent space. We
demonstrate the superiority of DMU through comprehensive experiments on
large-scale landmark retrieval and face recognition benchmarks. DMU effectively
alleviates the new-to-new degradation and improves new-to-old compatibility,

lasing action: the functional performance (threshold and wavelength) is
therefore dependent on both the opto-electronic and crystallographic properties

suffer from inter-nanowire variation, leading to, often dramatic, differences
in yield and performance between individual nanowires. Establishing the
relationship between manufacturing controls, geometric and material properties
and the lasing performance is a crucial step towards optimisation, however,
this is challenging to achieve experimentally due to the complex
interdependance of such properties. Here, we present a high-throughput
correlative approach to characterise over 5000 individual GaAsP/GaAs multiple

threshold carrier density, while coherence length measurements measures
end-facet reflectivity. We show that the lasing wavelength and threshold are
intrinsically related to the width of a single quantum well due to quantum
confinement and bandfilling effects. Unexpectedly, there is no strong
relationship between the properties of the lasing cavity (facet reflectivity

the threshold of these nanowire lasers, rather than the cavity quality.

Interactive Thresholding (FAITH), a thresholding technique that incorporates

uses interactively selected seed voxels to identify critical regions in which

local thresholding with intuitive user interaction. A qualitative analysis

to automatically discover high-quality hierarchical structures is still a great

{\em not precise} kernel evaluation, and demonstrate that the former is
exponentially more resource efficient requiring $N =

Here $\gamma$ is the margin of classification for an ideal quantum kernel

human perception of ECAs in the dimensions of human-likeness, animacy,
perceived intelligence, and focused attention. Our user study required
participants to interact with two ECAs - one with and one without hand
gestures. We collected subjective data from the participants' self-report
questionnaires and objective data from a gaze tracker. To our knowledge, the
current study represents the first attempt to evaluate data-driven gesturing
ECAs through real-time interaction and the first experiment using gaze-tracking
to examine the effect of ECAs' gestures.

  Classification","WACV 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Medical image datasets and their annotations are not growing as fast as their
equivalents in the general domain. This makes translation from the newest, more
data-intensive methods that have made a large impact on the vision field
increasingly more difficult and less efficient. In this paper, we propose a new
probabilistic latent variable model for disease classification in chest X-ray
images. Specifically we consider chest X-ray datasets that contain global
disease labels, and for a smaller subset contain object level expert
annotations in the form of eye gaze patterns and disease bounding boxes. We
propose a two-stage optimization algorithm which is able to handle these
different label granularities through a single training pipeline in a two-stage
manner. In our pipeline global dataset features are learned in the lower level
layers of the model. The specific details and nuances in the fine-grained
expert object-level annotations are learned in the final layers of the model
using a knowledge distillation method inspired by conditional variational
inference. Subsequently, model weights are frozen to guide this learning
process and prevent overfitting on the smaller richly annotated data subsets.
The proposed method yields consistent classification improvement across
different backbones on the common benchmark datasets Chest X-ray14 and
MIMIC-CXR. This shows how two-stage learning of labels from coarse to
fine-grained, in particular with object level annotations, is an effective
method for more optimal annotation usage.

paradigms Multi-Task Learning (MTL) and meta learning, to bring together the
best of both worlds. In particular, it focuses simultaneous learning of
multiple tasks, an element of MTL and promptly adapting to new tasks, a quality
of meta learning. It is important to highlight that we focus on heterogeneous
tasks, which are of distinct kind, in contrast to typically considered
homogeneous tasks (e.g., if all tasks are classification or if all tasks are
regression tasks). The fundamental idea is to train a multi-task model, such
that when an unseen task is introduced, it can learn in fewer steps whilst
offering a performance at least as good as conventional single task learning on
the new task or inclusion within the MTL. By conducting various experiments, we
demonstrate this paradigm on two datasets and four tasks: NYU-v2 and the
taskonomy dataset for which we perform semantic segmentation, depth estimation,
surface normal estimation, and edge detection. MTML achieves state-of-the-art
results for three out of four tasks for the NYU-v2 dataset and two out of four
for the taskonomy dataset. In the taskonomy dataset, it was discovered that
many pseudo-labeled segmentation masks lacked classes that were expected to be
present in the ground truth; however, our MTML approach was found to be
effective in detecting these missing classes, delivering good qualitative
results. While, quantitatively its performance was affected due to the presence
of incorrect ground truth labels. The the source code for reproducibility can

applications) are socially significant with the potential to help make
information accessible to a diverse set of users in multilingual societies. It
is desirable that such NMT systems be lexically constrained and draw from
domain-specific dictionaries. Dictionaries could present multiple candidate
translations for a source word/phrase due to the polysemous nature of words.
The onus is then on the NMT model to choose the contextually most appropriate
candidate. Prior work has largely ignored this problem and focused on the
single candidate constraint setting wherein the target word or phrase is
replaced by a single constraint. In this work we present \dictdis, a lexically
constrained NMT system that disambiguates between multiple candidate
translations derived from dictionaries. We achieve this by augmenting training
data with multiple dictionary candidates to actively encourage disambiguation
during training by implicitly aligning multiple candidate constraints. We
demonstrate the utility of \dictdis\ via extensive experiments on English-Hindi
and English-German sentences in a variety of domains including regulatory,
finance, engineering. We also present comparisons on standard benchmark test
datasets. In comparison with existing approaches for lexically constrained and
unconstrained NMT, we demonstrate superior performance with respect to
constraint copy and disambiguation related measures on all domains while also
obtaining improved fluency of up to 2-3 BLEU points on some domains.

careful sample preparation and microscope calibration, imaging techniques are
often prone to defects and unwanted artefacts. This is particularly problematic
for applications where the micrograph is to be used for simulation or feature
analysis, as defects are likely to lead to inaccurate results. Microstructural
inpainting is a method to alleviate this problem by replacing occluded regions
with synthetic microstructure with matching boundaries. In this paper we
introduce two methods that use generative adversarial networks to generate
contiguous inpainted regions of arbitrary shape and size by learning the
microstructural distribution from the unoccluded data. We find that one
benefits from high speed and simplicity, whilst the other gives smoother
boundaries at the inpainting border. We also outline the development of a
graphical user interface that allows users to utilise these machine learning
methods in a 'no-code' environment.

descriptions have attracted an increasing amount of attention during the past
few months. Despite their encouraging performance, these models raise concerns
about the misuse of their generated fake images. To tackle this problem, we
pioneer a systematic study on the detection and attribution of fake images
generated by text-to-image generation models. Concretely, we first build a
machine learning classifier to detect the fake images generated by various
text-to-image generation models. We then attribute these fake images to their
source models, such that model owners can be held responsible for their models'
misuse. We further investigate how prompts that generate fake images affect
detection and attribution. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular
text-to-image generation models, including DALL$\cdot$E 2, Stable Diffusion,
GLIDE, and Latent Diffusion, and two benchmark prompt-image datasets. Empirical
results show that (1) fake images generated by various models can be
distinguished from real ones, as there exists a common artifact shared by fake
images from different models; (2) fake images can be effectively attributed to
their source models, as different models leave unique fingerprints in their
generated images; (3) prompts with the ``person'' topic or a length between 25
and 75 enable models to generate fake images with higher authenticity. All
findings contribute to the community's insight into the threats caused by
text-to-image generation models. We appeal to the community's consideration of
the counterpart solutions, like ours, against the rapidly-evolving fake image
generation.

in optical Kerr microresonators is investigated. The study rests on a model
that consists of the Lugiato-Lefever equation, coupled to the one-dimensional
heat diffusion equation with a source term proportional to the average power of
the optical field. Using appropriate variable changes the model equations are
transformed into a set of coupled first-order nonlinear ordinary differential
equations. These equations are solved numerically with emphasis on the
influence of thermo-optic effects on the amplitude and instantaneous frequency
of the optical field, as well as on the temperature profile in the
microresonator cavity. It is found that thermo-optic effects do not prevent
soliton crytals from forming in optical Kerr microresonators, however, a strong
thermal detuning will decrease the soliton-crystal amplitude. The model
predicts a temperature profile in the microresonator cavity which is
insensitive to the specific spatio-temporal profile of the soliton crystal
propagating in the microresonator, a feature peculiar to the model.

some simple questions remain unanswered. One of these questions is ``Why do
stars become Red Giants?''. Here we present a relatively simple analytical
answer to this question. We validate our analysis by constructing a
quantitative toy-model of a red giant and comparing its predictions to full
stellar evolutionar models.
  We find that the envelope forces the value of $\nabla=d \ln T/d \ln P$ at,
and above, the burning shell into a very narrow range of possible values.
Together with the fact that the stellar material at the burning shell both
provides and transports most of the stellar luminosity, this leads to tight
relations between the thermodynamic variables at the burning shell and the mass
and radius of the core -- $T_s(M_c,R_s)$, $P_s(M_c,R_s)$ and $\rho_s(M_c,R_s)$.
When complemented by typical mass-radius relations of the helium cores, this
implies that for all stellar masses the evolution of the core dictates the
values of $T_s$, $P_s$ and $\rho_s$. We show that for all stellar masses
evolution leads to an increase in the pressure and density contrasts between
the shell and the core, forcing a huge expansion of the layers on top of the
burning shell.
  Besides explaining why stars become red giants our analysis also offers a
mathematical demonstration of the so-called shell homology relations, and
provides simple quantitative answers to some properties of low-mass red giants.

revenue of advertisers. Facing the complex and ever-changing bidding
environments in the real-world advertising system (RAS), state-of-the-art
auto-bidding policies usually leverage reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
to generate real-time bids on behalf of the advertisers. Due to safety
concerns, it was believed that the RL training process can only be carried out
in an offline virtual advertising system (VAS) that is built based on the
historical data generated in the RAS. In this paper, we argue that there exists
significant gaps between the VAS and RAS, making the RL training process suffer
from the problem of inconsistency between online and offline (IBOO). Firstly,
we formally define the IBOO and systematically analyze its causes and
influences. Then, to avoid the IBOO, we propose a sustainable online RL (SORL)
framework that trains the auto-bidding policy by directly interacting with the
RAS, instead of learning in the VAS. Specifically, based on our proof of the
Lipschitz smooth property of the Q function, we design a safe and efficient
online exploration (SER) policy for continuously collecting data from the RAS.
Meanwhile, we derive the theoretical lower bound on the safety of the SER
policy. We also develop a variance-suppressed conservative Q-learning (V-CQL)
method to effectively and stably learn the auto-bidding policy with the
collected data. Finally, extensive simulated and real-world experiments
validate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art auto-bidding

exploiting this key property, the proposed scheme encodes the local stochastic
gradients into a set of numerals. Next, it determines the positions of the
activated orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers by
using the values of the numerals. To eliminate the need for precise
sample-level time synchronization, channel estimation overhead, and channel
inversion, the proposed scheme also uses a non-coherent receiver at the edge
server (ES) and does not utilize a pre-equalization at the edge devices (EDs).
We theoretically analyze the MSE performance of the proposed scheme and the
convergence rate for a non-convex loss function. To improve the test accuracy
of FEEL with the proposed scheme, we introduce the concept of adaptive absolute

Matching with Delays (MPMD) - a problem introduced by Emek et al. (STOC'16). In
the original version of this problem, we are given an $n$-point metric space,
where requests arrive in an online fashion. The goal is to minimise the
matching cost for an even number of requests. However, contrary to traditional
online matching problems, a request does not have to be paired immediately at
the time of its arrival. Instead, the decision of whether to match a request
can be postponed for time $t$ at a delay cost of $t$. For this reason, the goal
of the MPMD is to minimise the overall sum of distance and delay costs.
Interestingly, for adversarially generated requests, no online algorithm can
achieve a competitive ratio better than $O(\log n/\log \log n)$ (Ashlagi et
al., APPROX/RANDOM'17).
  Here, we consider a stochastic version of the MPMD problem where the input
requests follow a Poisson arrival process. For such a problem, we show that the
above lower bound can be improved by presenting two deterministic online
algorithms, which, in expectation, are constant-competitive. The first one is a
simple greedy algorithm that matches any two requests once the sum of their
delay costs exceeds their connection cost, i.e., the distance between them. The
second algorithm builds on the tools used to analyse the first one in order to
obtain even better performance guarantees. This result is rather surprising as
the greedy approach for the adversarial model achieves a competitive ratio of
$\Omega(m^{\log \frac{3}{2}+\varepsilon})$, where $m$ denotes the number of
requests served (Azar et al., TOCS'20). Finally, we prove that it is possible
to obtain similar results for the general case when the delay cost follows an
arbitrary positive and non-decreasing function, as well as for the MPMD variant
with penalties to clear pending requests.

to exclude carbon from h-BN related process. Otherwise carbon prevails over
boron and nitrogen due to its larger binding energy, thereupon forming graphene
on metals after high-temperature annealing. We demonstrate the surface
reaction-assisted conversion from h-BN to graphene with high-temperature

h-BN/metals. When the temperature is lower than Tp, the quality of h-BN layer
is improved upon annealing. While the annealing temperature is above Tp, in
case of carbon-free conditions, the h-BN disintegrates and nitrogen desorbs
from the surface more easily than boron, eventually leading to clean metal
surfaces. However, once the h-BN layer is exposed to carbon, graphene forms on
Pt(111) in the high-temperature regime. This not only provides an indispensable
principle (avoid carbon) for fabricating high-quality h-BN materials on

our method substantially outperforms the previous strong baseline by a large

molecular chirality. The pioneering tricolor LCLs' degrees of chirality (DOCs)
change periodically in space and vanish by integrating over the whole spatial
period, making them cease to be globally effective (i.e., globally achiral).
Locally and globally chiral light (LGCL) is a type of more efficient LCL whose
DOCs survive by integrating but still change periodically in space. Here, we
propose a scheme to generate a new type of LCL called uniformly locally chiral
light (ULCL). ULCLs are globally chiral and have spatially uniform DOCs, which
makes them superior to current types of LCLs in studies of chiral molecules. By
applying the ULCLs in an optical molecular-chirality switch, the racemic
mixtures can be converted to enantiopure samples without size restrictions,
where the perfect control of molecular chirality with a global efficiency of
$100\%$ is predicted, which is twice that of LGCLs. Our work potentially
constitutes the starting point for developing more efficient chiroptical
techniques for probing and controlling molecular chirality.

nucleation and protein folding via a Monte Carlo (MC) exploration in path
space. Instead of configuration points, this method samples short molecular
dynamics (MD) trajectories with specific start- and end-conditions. As in
configuration MC, its efficiency highly depends on the types of MC moves. Since
the last two decades, the central MC move for path sampling has been the
so-called shooting move in which a perturbed phase point of the old path is
propagated backward and forward in time to generate a new path. Recently, we
proposed the subtrajectory moves, stone-skipping (SS) and web-throwing (WT),
that are demonstrably more efficient. However, the one-step crossing
requirement makes them somewhat more difficult to implement in combination with
external MD programs or when the order parameter determination is expensive. In
this article, we present strategies to address the issue. The most generic
solution is a new member of subtrajectory moves, wire fencing (WF), that is
less thrifty than the SS, but more versatile. This makes it easier to link path
sampling codes with external MD packages and provides a practical solution for
cases where the calculation of the order parameter is expensive or not a simple
function of geometry. We demonstrate the WF move in a double well Langevin
model, a thin film breaking transition based on classical force fields, and a
smaller ruthenium redox reaction at the ab initio level in which the order
parameter explicitly depends on the electron density.

during training. Broadly speaking, present ZSL methods usually adopt
class-level semantic labels and compare them with instance-level semantic

mostly produce imbalanced semantic predictions, i.e. these models could perform
precisely for some semantics, but may not for others. To address the drawback,
we aim to introduce an imbalanced learning framework into ZSL. However, we find
that imbalanced ZSL has two unique challenges: (1) Its imbalanced predictions
are highly correlated with the value of semantic labels rather than the number
of samples as typically considered in the traditional imbalanced learning; (2)
Different semantics follow quite different error distributions between classes.
To mitigate these issues, we first formalize ZSL as an imbalanced regression
problem which offers theoretical foundations to interpret how semantic labels
lead to imbalanced semantic predictions. We then propose a re-weighted loss
termed Re-balanced Mean-Squared Error (ReMSE), which tracks the mean and
variance of error distributions, thus ensuring rebalanced learning across
classes. As a major contribution, we conduct a series of analyses showing that
ReMSE is theoretically well established. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method effectively alleviates the imbalance in semantic prediction

characteristics as the structures arise and dissipate. We show how the Coriolis
force induces a one-way coupling between the radial and azimuthal velocity
fields inside the boundary layer, but in the bulk there is a two-way coupling
that causes competing effects. We discuss how this complicates the analogy of
narrow-gap Taylor-Couette to other convective flows. We then compare these
statistics to a similar shear flow without no-slip boundary layers, showing how
this double coupling causes very different effects. We finish by reflecting on
the possible origins of turbulent Taylor rolls.

system where the gauge field is exponentially amplified on super-horizon
scales, therefore evading the no-go theorem formulated on the basis of widely
encountered drastic back-reaction of the magnetic field energy on the
inflationary background. We argue that in order for the resonant scenario to
work with a bounded and positive-definite coupling function, a mass term for
the gauge sector is required. We compute the spectrum of the produced magnetic
fields and demonstrate the compatibility with current observational
constraints. We demonstrate that while the magnetic fields do not noticeably
back-react on the inflationary background, the non-zero mass term can
contribute significantly to the total energy-momentum tensor. We point out the

sentences from the original in-domain spoken language text data as prompts to
induce a pre-trained language model (i.e., GPT-2) to generate spoken language
texts in a similar style. Experimental results on three benchmarks of sign
language gloss translation in varied languages demonstrate that BT with spoken

methods. In addition, as the scale of spoken language texts generated by PGEN
increases, the BT technique can achieve further improvements, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our approach. We release the code and data for facilitating
future research in this field.

streams into small sequences that are then used to predict the temporal offset
between streams. (ii) We identify artefacts that can arise from the compression

large-scale atmospheric flows. In recent years, there has been growing interest
in extending the classical QG plus Ekman friction layer model (QG-Ekman) to
systematically include additional physical processes known to significantly
contribute to real-life weather phenomena. This paper lays the foundation for
combining two of these developments, namely Smith and Stechmann's family of

{\bfseries 74}, 3285--3303, 2017) on the one hand, and the extension of

the other hand. To this end, Smith and Stechmann's PQG equations for
sound-proof motions are first corroborated within a general asymptotic modeling
framework starting from a full compressible flow model. The derivations show
that the PQG model family is naturally embedded in the asymptotic hierarchy of
scale-dependent atmospheric flow models introduced by one of the present
authors in (Ann.\ Rev.\ Fluid Mech., {\bfseries 42}, 249--274). Particular
emphasis is then placed on an asymptotic scaling regime for PQG that accounts
for a generic Kessler-type bulk microphysics closure and is compatible with
QG-DL-Ekman theory. The detailed derivation of a moist QG-DL-Ekman model is
deferred to a future publication.

appear around mid-latitudes, and over time the latitudes of emergences migrate
towards the equator.The maximum level of activity (e.g., sunspot number) varies
from cycle to cycle.For strong cycles, the activity begins early and at higher
latitudes with wider sunspot distributions than for weak cycles. The activity
and the width of sunspot belts increase rapidly and begin to decline when the
belts are still at high latitudes. Surprisingly, it has been reported that in
the late stages of the cycle the level of activity (sunspot number) as well as
the widths and centers of the butterfly wings all have the same statistical
properties independent of how strong the cycle was during its rise and maximum

computations they perform is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Recently,
the framework of efficient coding proposed a theory of how spiking neural
networks can compute low-dimensional stimulus signals with high efficiency.
Efficient spiking networks are based on time-dependent minimization of a loss
function related to information coding with spikes. To inform the understanding
of the function and dynamics of biological networks in the brain, however, the
mathematical models have to be informed by biology and obey the same
constraints as biological networks. Currently, spiking network models of
efficient coding have been extended to include some features of biological
plausibility, such as architectures with excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
However, biological realism of efficient coding theories is still limited to
simple cases and does not include single neuron and network properties that are
known to be key in biological circuits. Here, we revisit the theory of
efficient coding with spikes to develop spiking neural networks that are closer
to biological circuits. Namely, we find a biologically plausible spiking model
realizing efficient coding in the case of a generalized leaky
integrate-and-fire network with excitatory and inhibitory units, equipped with
fast and slow synaptic currents, local homeostatic currents such as
spike-triggered adaptation, hyperpolarization-activated rebound current,
heterogeneous firing thresholds and resets, heterogeneous postsynaptic
potentials, and structured, low-rank connectivity. We show how the complexity
of E-E connectivity matrix shapes network responses.

performance in medical image segmentation due to their ability to extract

that traditional CNNs lack the intelligence to capture long-term dependencies
of different image regions. Following the success of applying Transformer
models on natural language processing tasks, the medical image segmentation
field has also witnessed growing interest in utilizing Transformers, due to
their ability to capture long-range contextual information. However, unlike
CNNs, Transformers lack the ability to learn local feature representations.
Thus, to fully utilize the advantages of both CNNs and Transformers, we propose
a hybrid encoder-decoder segmentation model (ConvTransSeg). It consists of a
multi-layer CNN as the encoder for feature learning and the corresponding
multi-level Transformer as the decoder for segmentation prediction. The encoder

solve phase relies on the Radial Basis Function-generated Finite Differences
(RBF-FD) using point clouds generated by advancing front node positioning
algorithm that supports variable node density. In the estimate phase, we
introduce an Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) error indicator, which assumes that the
error relates to the difference between the implicitly obtained solution (from
the solve phase) and a local explicit re-evaluation of the PDE at hand using a
higher order approximation. Based on the IMEX error indicator, the modified
Texas Three Step marking strategy is used to mark the computational nodes for
$h$-, $p$- or $hp$-(de-)refinement. Finally, in the refine phase, nodes are
repositioned and the order of the method is locally redefined using the
variable order of the augmenting monomials according to the instructions from
the mark phase.
  The performance of the introduced $hp$-adaptive method is first investigated
on a two-dimensional Peak problem and further applied to two- and
three-dimensional contact problems. We show that the proposed IMEX error
indicator adequately captures the global behaviour of the error in all cases
considered and that the proposed $hp$-adaptive solution procedure significantly
outperforms the non-adaptive approach. The proposed $hp$-adaptive method stands
for another important step towards a fully autonomous numerical method capable
of solving complex problems in realistic geometries without the user

pair of matrix norms. The measurement model corresponds to block-wise sensing
and the reconstruction is possible only when the total energy is well
distributed over blocks. The first norm, which is the maximum-block-Frobenius
norm, favors such a solution. This condition is analogous to the notion of
low-spikiness in matrix completion or column-wise sensing. The second norm,
which is a tensor norm on a pair of suitable Banach spaces, induces
low-rankness in the solution together with the first norm. We demonstrate that
the joint estimation provides a significant gain over the individual recovery
of each matrix when the number of matrices sharing a column space and the
ambient dimension of the shared column space are large relative to the number
of columns in each matrix. The convex estimator is cast as a semidefinite
program and an efficient ADMM algorithm is derived. The empirical behavior of

chemical properties of line-emitting gaseous systems. To perform plasma
diagnostics properly, it is essential to correct the input spectrum for
extinction properly. This is simply because determining the degree of
extinction is dependent on the physical properties of the line-emitting gas.
Hence, both extinction correction and plasma diagnostics have to be performed
simultaneously and self-consistently. By comparing the results of analyses
performed for a sample of nine bright planetary nebulae in M 31 with and
without the proper extinction correction and plasma diagnostics, we demonstrate
how initial assumptions for the physical conditions of the line-emitting gas in
extinction correction would compromise the results of the entire analyses.
While the electron density/temperature are relatively immune to the imposed
inconsistent assumptions, the compromised extinction would cause systematic
offsets in the extinction-corrected line strengths, which consequently would
impose adverse effects on the resulting ionic and elemental abundances, and
other inferences made from the incorrect results. We find that this M 31 PN
sample simply represents those around the high-mass end of the mass range for
low-mass planetary nebula progenitor stars as expected from the existing
theoretical models. It appears that the suspicion raised in the previous study
- these PNe being anomalously nitrogen overabundant - is simply caused by the
apparent underestimate in extinction that originates from the imposed
inconsistent assumptions in extinction correction. In a larger context, the
results of plasma diagnostics in the literature without seeking simultaneous
self-consistency with extinction correction have to be handled cautiously.
Ideally, such previous results should be re-evaluated by seeking simultaneous
self-consistency.

learning a best-fit linear dynamics model over snapshots of spatio-temporal

the bouncing-droplet problem that forges valuable new links with the
mathematical machinery of quantum mechanics. Moreover, it provides a low-rank
characterization of the bifurcation structure of the pilot wave physics.
Specifically, the analysis shows that as the vibrational acceleration is
increased, the pilot-wave field undergoes a series of Hopf bifurcations that
ultimately lead to a chaotic wave field. The established relation between the
mean pilot-wave field and the droplet statistics allows us to characterize the
evolution of the emergent statistics with increased vibrational forcing from
the evolution of the pilot-wave field. We thus develop a numerical framework
with the same basic structure as quantum mechanics, specifically a wave theory

control of flows in a statistically steady regime far from the steady base
flow: the mean resolvent $\mathbf{R}_0$. It is defined as the operator
predicting, in the frequency domain, the mean linear response to forcing of the
time-varying base flow. As such, it provides the statistically optimal linear
time-invariant approximation of the input-output dynamics. Theory is developed
for the periodic case. The poles of the operator are shown to correspond to the
Floquet exponents of the system, including purely imaginary poles at multiples
of the fundamental frequency. In general, evaluating mean transfer functions
from data requires averaging the response to many realizations of the same
input. However, in the specific case of harmonic forcings, we show that the
mean transfer functions may be identified without averaging: an observation
referred to as `dynamic linearity' in the literature (Dahan et al., 2012). For
incompressible flows in the weakly unsteady limit, i.e. when amplification of
external perturbations by the unsteady part of the periodic Jacobian is small
compared to amplification by the mean Jacobian, the mean resolvent
$\mathbf{R}_{0}$ is well-approximated by the well-known resolvent operator
about the mean-flow $\mathbf{R}_{\overline{\mathbf{U}}} $. Although the theory
presented in this paper only extends to quasiperiodic flows, the definition of
the operator remains meaningful for more complex flows with continuous or mixed
spectra, including turbulent flows. Numerical evidence is provided supporting
the close connection between $\mathbf{R}_0$ and
$\mathbf{R}_{\overline{\mathbf{U}}}$ in the case of quasiperiodic, chaotic and

black holes, Messier~87* (M 87*) and Sagittarius~A* (Sgr A*). The EHT
collaboration used these images to indirectly constrain black hole parameters
by calibrating measurements of the sky-plane emission morphology to images of
general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. Here, we develop
a model for directly constraining the black hole mass, spin, and inclination
through signatures of lensing, redshift, and frame dragging, while
simultaneously marginalizing over the unknown accretion and emission
properties. By assuming optically thin, axisymmetric, equatorial emission near
the black hole, our model gains orders of magnitude in speed over similar
approaches that require radiative transfer. Using 2017 EHT M 87* baseline
coverage, we use fits of the model to itself to show that the data are
insufficient to demonstrate existence of the photon ring. We then survey
time-averaged GRMHD simulations fitting EHT-like data, and find that our model
is best-suited to fitting magnetically arrested disks, which are the favored
class of simulations for both M 87* and Sgr A*. For these simulations, the
best-fit model parameters are within ${\sim}10\%$ of the true mass and within
${\sim}10^\circ$ for inclination. With 2017 EHT coverage and 1\% fractional
uncertainty on amplitudes, spin is unconstrained. Accurate inference of spin
axis position angle depends strongly on spin and electron temperature. Our
results show the promise of directly constraining black hole spacetimes with
interferometric data, but they also show that nearly identical images permit
large differences in black hole properties, highlighting degeneracies between
the plasma properties, spacetime, and most crucially, the unknown emission
geometry when studying lensed accretion flow images at a single frequency.

which does not require full spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling and
depends on as few observables as possible, to guarantee its broad
applicability. To achieve this, we create a set of models in CIGALE and define
an SFR change diagnostic as the ratio of the SFR averaged over the past 5 and
200 Myr, <SFR5>/<SFR200>, probed by the H$\alpha$-FUV colour. We apply
<SFR5>/<SFR200> to the nearby spiral NGC 628 and find that its star formation
activity has overall been declining in the recent past, with the spiral arms,
however, maintaining a higher level of activity. The impact of the spiral arm
structure is observed to be stronger on <SFR5>/<SFR200> than on the star
formation efficiency (SFE$_\text{H$_2$}$). In addition, increasing disk
pressure tends to increase recent star formation, and consequently
<SFR5>/<SFR200>. We conclude that <SFR5>/<SFR200> is sensitive to the molecular
gas content, spiral arm structure, and disk pressure. The <SFR5>/<SFR200>

network structure. Therefore, it becomes practically important to investigate
how different optimization algorithms and machine learning techniques can be

  As one of the most important vertical domains for IoT applications, smart
transportation system has played a key role for providing real-world
information and services to citizens by making their access to transport
facilities easier and thus it is one of the key application areas to be
explored in this thesis.
  In a nutshell, this thesis covers three key topics related to applying
mathematical optimization and deep learning methods to IoT networks. In the
first topic, we propose an optimal transmission frequency management scheme
using decentralized ADMM-based method in a IoT network and introduce a
mechanism to identify anomalies in data transmission frequency using an
LSTM-based architecture. In the second topic, we leverage graph neural network
(GNN) for demand prediction for shared bikes. In particular, we introduce a
novel architecture, i.e., attention-based spatial temporal graph convolutional
network (AST-GCN), to improve the prediction accuracy in real world datasets.
In the last topic, we consider a highway traffic network scenario where
frequent lane changing behaviors may occur with probability. A specific GNN
based anomaly detector is devised to reveal such a probability driven by data
collected in a dedicated mobility simulator.

arguments and the compelling evidence into a safety case. Reviews and testing,
two common approaches to ensure correctness of automotive systems cannot
explore the typically infinite set of possible behaviours. In contrast, formal
methods are exhaustive methods that can provide mathematical proofs of
correctness of models, and they can be used to prove that formalizations of
functional safety requirements are fulfilled by formal models of system
components. This paper shows how formal methods can provide evidence for the
correct break-down of the functional safety requirements onto the components
that are part of feedback loops, and how this evidence fits into the argument
of the safety case. If a proof is obtained, the formal models are used as
requirements on the components. This structure of the safety argumentation can
be used to alleviate the need for reviews and tests to ensure that the

extended by introducing the time-advance ones and then utilized to seek

the RE activities, the overall software development process, and the people
involved in these activities. Moreover, we found a set of strategies that can
be applied to mitigate the negative impact of personality on RE activities.
Conclusion: Our identified impacts of personality on RE activities and
mitigation strategies serve to provide guidance to software practitioners on
handling such possible personality impacts on RE activities and for researchers
to investigate these impacts in greater depth in future.

can directly be interpreted as uncertainty estimates. It has been shown
recently that deep neural networks are poorly calibrated and tend to output
overconfident predictions. As a remedy, we propose a low-bias, trainable
calibration error estimator based on Dirichlet kernel density estimates, which
asymptotically converges to the true $L_p$ calibration error. This novel
estimator enables us to tackle the strongest notion of multiclass calibration,
called canonical (or distribution) calibration, while other common calibration
methods are tractable only for top-label and marginal calibration. The
computational complexity of our estimator is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, the
convergence rate is $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$, and it is unbiased up to
$\mathcal{O}(n^{-2})$, achieved by a geometric series debiasing scheme. In
practice, this means that the estimator can be applied to small subsets of
data, enabling efficient estimation and mini-batch updates. The proposed method
has a natural choice of kernel, and can be used to generate consistent
estimates of other quantities based on conditional expectation, such as the
sharpness of a probabilistic classifier. Empirical results validate the
correctness of our estimator, and demonstrate its utility in canonical
calibration error estimation and calibration error regularized risk
minimization.

rely on transductive entity embeddings and cannot generalize to KGs containing
new entities without retraining the entity embeddings. In this work, we study
the inductive query answering task where inference is performed on a graph
containing new entities with queries over both seen and unseen entities. To
this end, we devise two mechanisms leveraging inductive node and relational
structure representations powered by graph neural networks (GNNs).
Experimentally, we show that inductive models are able to perform logical
reasoning at inference time over unseen nodes generalizing to graphs up to 500%
larger than training ones. Exploring the efficiency--effectiveness trade-off,
we find the inductive relational structure representation method generally
achieves higher performance, while the inductive node representation method is
able to answer complex queries in the inference-only regime without any
training on queries and scales to graphs of millions of nodes. Code is

Furthermore, we train and evaluate these models, both qualitatively and

regularity of the solution $u(t)$ of the evolution problem correlates directly
to the regularity of the forcing function $f(x)$. Additionally, we show that
when $f$ is smooth, then $u$ is also smooth. These results extend studies that
have examined singularity points, or the lack of regularity, in rational
rotations of the chess billiard flow. We also present numerical simulations in
various geometries that analyze plateau formation and fractal dimension in
$r(\lambda)$ and conjecture an extension of our results. Our results can be
applied in modeling two dimensional oceanic waves, and they also relate the
classical quantum correspondence to fluid study.

NLP tasks. They however suffer from a prohibitive limitation due to the
self-attention mechanism, inducing $O(n^2)$ complexity with regard to sequence
length. To answer this limitation we introduce the LSG architecture which
relies on Local, Sparse and Global attention. We show that LSG attention is
fast, efficient and competitive in classification and summarization tasks on
long documents. Interestingly, it can also be used to adapt existing pretrained
models to efficiently extrapolate to longer sequences with no additional
training. Along with the introduction of the LSG attention mechanism, we
propose tools to train new models and adapt existing ones based on this
mechanism.

localization and location-based services. This has led recent advances to be
focused on reducing the ranging errors, whilst research focusing on enabling
more reliable and energy efficient communication has been largely unexplored.
The IEEE 802.15.4 UWB physical layer allows for several settings to be selected
that influence the energy consumption, range, and reliability. Combined with
the available link state diagnostics reported by UWB devices, there is an
opportunity to dynamically select PHY settings based on the environment. To
address this, we propose a deep Q-learning approach for enabling reliable UWB
communication, maximizing packet reception rate (PRR) and minimizing energy
consumption. Deep Q-learning is a good fit for this problem, as it is an
inherently adaptive algorithm that responds to the environment. Validation in a
realistic office environment showed that the algorithm outperforms traditional
Q-learning, linear search and using a fixed PHY layer. We found that deep
Q-learning achieves a higher average PRR and reduces the ranging error while
using only 14% of the energy compared to a fixed PHY setting in a dynamic
office environment.

technology applications based on data-driven discovery, machine learning
methods, especially deep neural networks, have become widely used. In order to
enable such applications, both hardware accelerators and advanced AI-ML methods
have led to the introduction of new architectures, system designs, algorithms,

observations: 1) Energy efficiency due to geometrical scaling is slowing down;
2) The energy efficiency at the bit-level does not translate into efficiency at
the instruction-level, or at the system-level for a variety of systems,
especially for large-scale AI-ML accelerators or supercomputers; 3) At the
application level, general-purpose AI-ML methods can be computationally energy

integrating energy efficiency with performance analysis for enabling
high-performance and sustainable computing in the future.

  Reduction Techniques",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Dimensionality reduction techniques map data represented on higher dimensions
onto lower dimensions with varying degrees of information loss. Graph
dimensionality reduction techniques adopt the same principle of providing
latent representations of the graph structure with minor adaptations to the
output representations along with the input data. There exist several cutting
edge techniques that are efficient at generating embeddings from graph data and
projecting them onto low dimensional latent spaces. Due to variations in the
operational philosophy, the benefits of a particular graph dimensionality
reduction technique might not prove advantageous to every scenario or rather
every dataset. As a result, some techniques are efficient at representing the
relationship between nodes at lower dimensions, while others are good at
encapsulating the entire graph structure on low dimensional space. We present
this survey to outline the benefits as well as problems associated with the
existing graph dimensionality reduction techniques. We also attempted to
connect the dots regarding the potential improvements to some of the
techniques. This survey could be helpful for upcoming researchers interested in
exploring the usage of graph representation learning to effectively produce
low-dimensional graph embeddings with varying degrees of granularity.

simple architecture has the computational efficiency to handle large systems.
Its implementation, however, often requires full state-vector measurements and
knowledge of the system nonlinearities. We use nonlinear projector functions to
expand the system measurements to a high dimensional space and then feed them
to a reservoir to obtain forecasts. We demonstrate the application of such
reservoir computing networks on spatiotemporally chaotic systems, which model
several features of turbulence. We show that using radial basis functions as
nonlinear projectors enables complex system nonlinearities to be captured
robustly even with only partial observations and without knowing the governing
equations. Finally, we show that when measurements are sparse or incomplete and
noisy, such that even the governing equations become inaccurate, our networks
can still produce reasonably accurate forecasts, thus paving the way towards
model-free forecasting of practical turbulent systems.

computational irreducibility in terms of the exactness of functorial
correspondence between a category of data structures and elementary
computations and a corresponding category of (1-dimensional) cobordisms. We
proceed to demonstrate that, by equipping both categories with a symmetric
monoidal structure and considering the case of higher-dimensional cobordism
categories, we obtain a natural extension of this formalism that serves also to
encompass non-deterministic or ``multiway'' computations, in which one
quantifies not only the irreducibility in the behavior of a single
(deterministic) computation path, but in the branching and merging behavior of
an entire ``multiway system'' of such paths too. We finally outline how, in the
most general case, the resulting symmetric monoidal functor may be considered
to be adjoint to the functor characterizing the Atiyah-Segal axiomatization of
a functorial quantum field theory. Thus, we conclude by arguing that the
irreducibility of (multi)computations may be thought of as being dual to the
locality of time evolution in functorial approaches to quantum mechanics and
quantum field theory. In the process, we propose an extension of the methods of
standard (monoidal) category theory, in which morphisms are effectively
equipped with intrinsic computational complexity data, together with an algebra
for how those complexities compose (both in sequence and in parallel, subject
to the monoidal structure).
