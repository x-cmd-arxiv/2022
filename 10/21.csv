outcome and records non-tabular patient data, such as magnetic resonance
imaging or text data in the form of electronic health records. Recently,
several neural-network based solutions have been proposed, some of which are
binary classifiers. Parametric, distribution-free approaches which make full
use of survival time and censoring status have not received much attention. We
present deep conditional transformation models (DCTMs) for survival outcomes as
a unifying approach to parametric and semiparametric survival analysis. DCTMs
allow the specification of non-linear and non-proportional hazards for both
tabular and non-tabular data and extend to all types of censoring and
truncation. On real and semi-synthetic data, we show that DCTMs compete with
state-of-the-art DL approaches to survival analysis.

low-temperature atmospheric pressure plasma reactors based on transferred arc

characterized to produce hydrogen from low-density polyethylene (LDPE) as a
model plastic waste. Experimental results show that hydrogen production rate

reactors, with the maximum hydrogen production of 0.33 and 0.42 mmol/g LDPE for
transarc and glidarc reactors, respectively. For the transarc reactor, smaller
electrode-feedstock spacing favors greater hydrogen production, whereas, for
the glidarc reactor, greater hydrogen production is obtained at intermediate
flow rates. The hydrogen production from LDPE is comparable despite the
markedly different modes of operation between the two reactors.

specialized group robustness training. Following recent work on Deep Feature
Reweighting (DFR), we evaluate the feature representations by re-training the

broken. On multiple vision and NLP problems, we show that the features learned

group robustness methods targeted at reducing the effect of spurious

began with the works of Buckholtz and Carlitz in their studies of an asymptotic

combinatorial interpretations of the second-order Eulerian polynomials.
Recently, there is a growing interest in the properties of Stirling
permutations. The motivation of this paper is to develop a general method for
finding equidistributed statistics on Stirling permutations. Firstly, we show
that the up-down-pair statistic is equidistributed with ascent-plateau
statistic, and that the exterior up-down-pair statistic is equidistributed with
left ascent-plateau statistic. Secondly, we introduce the Stirling permutation
codes. Several equidistribution results follow from simple applications. In
particular, we find that six bivariable set-valued statistics are
equidistributed on the set of Stirling permutations. As an application, we
extend a classical result independently established by Dumont and Bona.
Thirdly, we explore bijections among Stirling permutation codes, perfect
matchings and trapezoidal words. We then show the e-positivity of the
enumerators of Stirling permutations by left ascent-plateaux, exterior
up-down-pairs and right plateau-descents. In the final part, the e-positivity
of the multivariate k-th order Eulerian polynomials is established, which

quantum erasure can be understood in terms of the standard EPR correlation.
Nevertheless, the quantum eraser still raises a conceptual issue beyond the
standard EPR paradox, if counterfactual reasoning is taken into account.
Furthermore, the quantum eraser experiments can be classified into two major
categories: the entanglement quantum eraser and the Scully-Dr\""uhl-type quantum
eraser. These two types are formally equivalent to each other, but conceptually
the latter presents a ""mystery"" more prominent than the former. In the
Scully-Dr\""uhl-type quantum eraser, the statement that the which-way

consequence of counterfactual reasoning but bears some factual significance.
Accordingly, it makes good sense to say that the ""record"" of the which-way

discriminates the record is eliminated by the delayed-choice measurement. We
also reconsider the quantum eraser in the many-worlds interpretation (MWI),

variation, suggesting an option that this high-energy photon was emitted at the

Thus this highest energy photon event detected by Fermi-LAT during the prompt
emission of gamma-ray bursts might be considered as an optional signal for the
linear form modification of light speed in cosmological space.

on the restricted spectral structure, and are typically super-linear. Second,
by combining this meta-result with sample-size dependent guarantees for

computational costs. This paper proposes UL2R, a method that substantially
improves existing language models and their scaling curves with a relatively
tiny amount of extra compute. The key idea is to continue training a
state-of-the-art large language model (e.g., PaLM) on a few more steps with
UL2's mixture-of-denoiser objective. We show that, with almost negligible extra
computational costs and no new sources of data, we are able to substantially
improve the scaling properties of large language models on downstream metrics.
In this paper, we continue training PaLM with UL2R, introducing a new set of
models at 8B, 62B, and 540B scale which we call U-PaLM. Impressively, at 540B
scale, we show an approximately 2x computational savings rate where U-PaLM
achieves the same performance as the final PaLM 540B model at around half its
computational budget (i.e., saving $\sim$4.4 million TPUv4 hours). We further
show that this improved scaling curve leads to 'emergent abilities' on
challenging BIG-Bench tasks -- for instance, U-PaLM does much better than PaLM
on some tasks or demonstrates better quality at much smaller scale (62B as
opposed to 540B). Overall, we show that U-PaLM outperforms PaLM on many
few-shot setups, i.e., English NLP tasks (e.g., commonsense reasoning, question
answering), reasoning tasks with chain-of-thought (e.g., GSM8K), multilingual
tasks (MGSM, TydiQA), MMLU and challenging BIG-Bench tasks. Finally, we provide

developed to carry out molecular docking, most focus on the limiting case of
docking two molecules. Since the number of possible configurations of N
molecules is exponential in N, those exceptions which permit docking of more
than two molecules scale poorly, requiring exponential resources to find
high-quality solutions. Here, we introduce a one-hot encoded quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization formulation (QUBO) of the multibody molecular
docking problem, which is suitable for solution by quantum annealer. Our
approach involves a classical pre-computation of pairwise interactions, which
scales only quadratically in the number of bodies while permitting well-vetted
scoring functions like the Rosetta REF2015 energy function to be used. In a
second step, we use the quantum annealer to sample low-energy docked
configurations efficiently, considering all possible docked configurations
simultaneously through quantum superposition. We show that we are able to
minimize the time needed to find diverse low-energy docked configurations by
tuning the strength of the penalty used to enforce the one-hot encoding,
demonstrating a 3-4 fold improvement in solution quality and diversity over
performance achieved with conventional penalty strengths. By mapping the
configurational search to a form compatible with current- and future-generation
quantum annealers, this work provides an alternative means of solving multibody
docking problems that may prove to have performance advantages for large
problems, potentially circumventing the exponential scaling of classical
approaches and permitting a much more efficient solution to a problem central

instructions has been shown to improve model performance and generalization to
unseen tasks. In this paper we explore instruction finetuning with a particular
focus on (1) scaling the number of tasks, (2) scaling the model size, and (3)
finetuning on chain-of-thought data. We find that instruction finetuning with
the above aspects dramatically improves performance on a variety of model
classes (PaLM, T5, U-PaLM), prompting setups (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT), and
evaluation benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, TyDiQA, MGSM, open-ended generation). For
instance, Flan-PaLM 540B instruction-finetuned on 1.8K tasks outperforms PALM
540B by a large margin (+9.4% on average). Flan-PaLM 540B achieves
state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, such as 75.2% on five-shot
MMLU. We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints, which achieve strong
few-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B.
Overall, instruction finetuning is a general method for improving the
performance and usability of pretrained language models.

  Registration Network",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reconstructing 3D layouts from multiple $360^{\circ}$ panoramas has received
increasing attention recently as estimating a complete layout of a large-scale
and complex room from a single panorama is very difficult. The state-of-the-art
method, called PSMNet, introduces the first learning-based framework that
jointly estimates the room layout and registration given a pair of panoramas.
However, PSMNet relies on an approximate (i.e., ""noisy"") registration as input.
Obtaining this input requires a solution for wide baseline registration which
is a challenging problem. In this work, we present a complete multi-view
panoramic layout estimation framework that jointly learns panorama registration
and layout estimation given a pair of panoramas without relying on a pose
prior. The major improvement over PSMNet comes from a novel Geometry-aware
Panorama Registration Network or GPR-Net that effectively tackles the wide
baseline registration problem by exploiting the layout geometry and computing
fine-grained correspondences on the layout boundaries, instead of the global
pixel-space. Our architecture consists of two parts. First, given two
panoramas, we adopt a vision transformer to learn a set of 1D horizon features
sampled on the panorama. These 1D horizon features encode the depths of
individual layout boundary samples and the correspondence and covisibility maps
between layout boundaries. We then exploit a non-linear registration module to
convert these 1D horizon features into a set of corresponding 2D boundary
points on the layout. Finally, we estimate the final relative camera pose via
RANSAC and obtain the complete layout simply by taking the union of registered
layouts. Experimental results indicate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both panorama registration and layout
estimation on a large-scale indoor panorama dataset ZInD.

estimate. In this work, we measured the bar pattern speed of 97 Milky-Way
Analogue galaxies from the MaNGA survey using the Tremaine-Weinberg method. The
sample was selected by constraining the stellar mass and morphological type. We
improve our measurements by weighting three independent estimates of the disc
position angle. To recover the disc rotation curve, we fit a kinematic model to
the H$_\alpha$ velocity maps correcting for the non-circular motions produced
by the bar. The complete sample has a smooth distribution of the bar pattern
speed ($\Omega_{Bar}=28.14^{+12.30}_{-9.55}$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc $^{-1}$),
corotation radius ($R_{CR} = 7.82^{+3.99}_{-2.96}$ kpc) and the rotation rate
($\mathcal{R} = 1.35^{+0.60}_{-0.40}$). We found two sets of correlations: (i)
between the bar pattern speed, the bar length and the logarithmic stellar mass
(ii) between the bar pattern speed, the disc circular velocity and the bar
rotation rate. If we constrain our sample by inclination within $30 \degree < i
< 60 \degree$ and relative orientation $20\degree<|PA_{disc}-PA_{bar}
|<70\degree$, the correlations become stronger and the fraction of ultra-fast
bars is reduced from 20\% to 10\% of the sample. This suggest that a
significant fraction of ultra-fast bars in our sample could be associated to
the geometric limitations of the TW-method. By further constraining the bar
size and disc circular velocity, we obtain a sub-sample of 25 Milky-Way
analogues galaxies with distributions $\Omega_{Bar}=30.48^{+10.94}_{-6.57}$ km

allowing to synthesize convincing images for a large variety of text prompts.
In this article, we propose DiffEdit, a method to take advantage of
text-conditioned diffusion models for the task of semantic image editing, where
the goal is to edit an image based on a text query. Semantic image editing is
an extension of image generation, with the additional constraint that the
generated image should be as similar as possible to a given input image.
Current editing methods based on diffusion models usually require to provide a
mask, making the task much easier by treating it as a conditional inpainting
task. In contrast, our main contribution is able to automatically generate a
mask highlighting regions of the input image that need to be edited, by
contrasting predictions of a diffusion model conditioned on different text
prompts. Moreover, we rely on latent inference to preserve content in those
regions of interest and show excellent synergies with mask-based diffusion.
DiffEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance on ImageNet. In
addition, we evaluate semantic image editing in more challenging settings,
using images from the COCO dataset as well as text-based generated images.

of the great mysteries of modern astrophysics. It has been suggested that
UHECRs could be accelerated in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and engine-driven
supernovae (SNe). Here we report the discovery of a 1.4 teraelectronvolt (TeV)
photon offset 0.97$^{\circ}$ from the site of the nearby (36.9 megaparsecs) GRB
980425/SN 1998bw explosion. The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected the TeV emission on 17 November 2018, more
than 20 years after the original GRB 980425/SN 1998bw trigger. TeV detections
at high Galactic latitudes by the LAT are extremely rare, with an average of 6
events per year. We propose that the delayed TeV emission is consistent with
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and/or electron-positron pairs from GRB 980425/SN
1998bw being deflected by the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) and
subsequently cascading into secondary gamma rays. Based on the arrival time
delay of the TeV emission, we estimate an IGMF strength of order $B \simeq
10^{-12}$-$10^{-13}$ Gauss. This result supports the possibility of UHECR
acceleration in GRB 980425/SN 1998bw and suggests that most detected UHECRs are
produced in local GRB/SNe within 200 Mpc. In addition, secondary photons from
UHECRs out to 0.9-31 Gpc may also offer an explanation for extragalactic
background photons with energies $\geq 1$ TeV detected by the Fermi LAT.

subsequently learns a policy for the target task that invokes these learned

performance on novel tasks, namely representation learning objectives to enable
more predictable skill representations and a retrieval-based data augmentation
mechanism to increase the scope of supervision for policy training. On a

  Once we restrict ourselves to the purely linear density stratification, our

distributions (SEDs) over the frequency range 15--45 GHz, determining the
best-fitting model parameters using power-law and thermal gyro-synchrotron
emission models. The SEDs of the three chromospherically active binaries
(Algol, UX Arietis, HR 1099) were well-fit by a power-law gyro-synchrotron
model, with no evidence for a thermal component. However, the SEDs of the two
weak-lined T Tauri stars (V410 Tau, HD 283572) had a circularly polarized
enhancement above 30 GHz that was inconsistent with a pure power-law
distribution. These spectra were well-fit by summing the emission from an
extended coronal volume of power-law gyro-synchrotron emission and a smaller
region with thermal plasma and a much stronger magnetic field emitting thermal
gyro-synchrotron radiation. We used Bayesian inference to estimate the physical
plasma parameters of the emission regions (characteristic size, electron
density, temperature, power-law index, and magnetic field strength and
direction) using independently measured radio sizes, X-ray luminosities, and
magnetic field strengths as priors, where available. The derived parameters
were well-constrained but somewhat degenerate. The power-law and thermal
volumes in the pre-main-sequence stars are probably not co-spatial, and we
speculate they may arise from two distinct regions: a tangled-field
magnetosphere where reconnection occurs and a recently discovered axisymmetric
toroidal magnetic field, respectively.

single-cell features, such as division patterns or elongation rates. Unlike in
common multiple object tracking, in microbial live-cell experiments cells are
growing, moving, and dividing over time, to form cell colonies that are densely
packed in mono-layer structures. With increasing cell numbers, following the
precise cell-cell associations correctly over many generations becomes more and
more challenging, due to the massively increasing number of possible
associations.
  To tackle this challenge, we propose a fast parameter-free cell tracking
approach, which consists of activity-prioritized nearest neighbor assignment of
growing cells and a combinatorial solver that assigns splitting mother cells to
their daughters. As input for the tracking, Omnipose is utilized for instance
segmentation. Unlike conventional nearest-neighbor-based tracking approaches,
the assignment steps of our proposed method are based on a Gaussian
activity-based metric, predicting the cell-specific migration probability,
thereby limiting the number of erroneous assignments. In addition to being a
building block for cell tracking, the proposed activity map is a standalone
tracking-free metric for indicating cell activity. Finally, we perform a
quantitative analysis of the tracking accuracy for different frame rates, to
inform life scientists about a suitable (in terms of tracking performance)
choice of the frame rate for their cultivation experiments, when cell tracks

mode in response to a changing environment. If an adversary can estimate the
utility function of a cognitive radar, it can determine the radar's sensing
strategy and mitigate the radar performance via electronic countermeasures
(ECM). This paper discusses how a cognitive radar can {\em hide} its strategy
from an adversary that detects cognition. The radar does so by transmitting
purposefully designed sub-optimal responses to spoof the adversary's
Neyman-Pearson detector. We provide theoretical guarantees by ensuring the
Type-I error probability of the adversary's detector exceeds a pre-defined
level for a specified tolerance on the radar's performance loss. We illustrate
our cognition masking scheme via numerical examples involving waveform
adaptation and beam allocation. We show that small purposeful deviations from
the optimal strategy of the radar confuse the adversary by significant amounts,
thereby masking the radar's cognition. Our approach uses novel ideas from
revealed preference in microeconomics and adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning. Our proposed algorithms provide a principled approach for
system-level electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) to mask the radar's
cognition, i.e., hide the radar's strategy from an adversary. We also provide
performance bounds for our cognition masking scheme when the adversary has

accelerators that simultaneously bunch and accelerate charged particle beams.
The accurate simulation and optimization of these devices can be lengthy due to
the need to repeatedly perform high-fidelity simulations. Surrogate modeling is
a technique wherein costly simulations are replaced by a fast-executing
""surrogate"" based on a deep neural network (DNN) or other statistical learning
technique. In a recent paper, we showed the first encouraging results of this
technique applied to RFQs, albeit with >12% training and validation errors for
some objectives. Here we present a study to test the feasibility of pursuing
this avenue further, switching to the Julia programming language and utilizing
GPUs for more efficient use of the available hardware. We also investigate the
input data structure and show that some input variables are correlated, which
may pose challenges for a standard fully-connected deep neural net. We perform
the appropriate transformations of the variables to more closely resemble a
uniform random sample. Julia's higher computational efficiency allows us to
expand the limits of our previous hyper-parameter scan, significantly reducing
mean average percent errors of select objectives while only slightly improving
others. Encouraged by these results and informed by other observations
presented in this paper, we conclude that more exhaustive hyperparameter
searches of multivariate DNNs, while mitigating overfitting, are well-motivated
as a next step. In addition, we recommend avenues for a set of DNNs fine-tuned
for predictions of subsets of output variables, as well as frameworks other

(I) the inability to drop uninformative masked regions in ConvNets as they
process data continuously, resulting in low training efficiency compared to ViT
models; and (II) the mismatch between erase-based masking and the
contrastive-based objective in Siamese ConvNets, which differs from the MIM

MixMask to prevent information incompleteness caused by the randomly erased

of matter that is stable in nature. Consequently, understanding the formation
of matter relies on explaining the dynamics and the properties of the proton's
bound state.A fundamental property of the proton involves the response of the
system to an external electromagnetic field. It is characterized by the
electromagnetic polarizabilities that describe how easily the charge and
magnetization distributions inside the system are distorted by the
electromagnetic field. Moreover, the generalized polarizabilities map out the
resulting deformation of the densities in a proton subject to an
electromagnetic field. They disclose essential information about the underlying
system dynamics and provide a key for decoding the proton structure in terms of
the theory of the strong interaction that binds its elementary quark and gluon
constituents. Of particular interest is a puzzle in the electric generalized
polarizability of the proton that remains unresolved for two decades. Here we
report measurements of the proton's electromagnetic generalized
polarizabilities at low four-momentum transfer squared. We show evidence of an
anomaly to the behaviour of the proton's electric generalized polarizability
that contradicts the predictions of nuclear theory and derive its signature in
the spatial distribution of the induced polarization in the proton. The
reported measurements suggest the presence of a new, not-yet-understood
dynamical mechanism in the proton and present notable challenges to the nuclear

transfer performance on various downstream tasks. To cope with this issue, we
propose Maximum Entropy Coding (MEC), a more principled objective that
explicitly optimizes on the structure of the representation, so that the

downstream tasks. Inspired by the principle of maximum entropy in information
theory, we hypothesize that a generalizable representation should be the one
that admits the maximum entropy among all plausible representations. To make
the objective end-to-end trainable, we propose to leverage the minimal coding
length in lossy data coding as a computationally tractable surrogate for the
entropy, and further derive a scalable reformulation of the objective that
allows fast computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MEC learns a
more generalizable representation than previous methods based on specific
pretext tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance consistently on various
downstream tasks, including not only ImageNet linear probe, but also

are the building blocks of our game. They consist of square tiles joined
edge-to-edge to form different colored shapes. Each tile represents a
single-qubit measurement basis, differentiated by its color. Polyominos rest on
a square-grid playing board, which signifies a cluster state. We show that
mapping a quantum circuit to MBQC is equivalent to arranging a set of

  Classification","Accepted by BMVC2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-label image classification aims to predict all possible labels in an
image. It is usually formulated as a partial-label learning problem, since it
could be expensive in practice to annotate all the labels in every training
image. Existing works on partial-label learning focus on the case where each
training image is labeled with only a subset of its positive/negative labels.
To effectively address partial-label classification, this paper proposes an
end-to-end Generic Game-theoretic Network (G2NetPL) for partial-label learning,
which can be applied to most partial-label settings, including a very
challenging, but annotation-efficient case where only a subset of the training
images are labeled, each with only one positive label, while the rest of the
training images remain unlabeled. In G2NetPL, each unobserved label is
associated with a soft pseudo label, which, together with the network,
formulates a two-player non-zero-sum non-cooperative game. The objective of the
network is to minimize the loss function with given pseudo labels, while the
pseudo labels will seek convergence to 1 (positive) or 0 (negative) with a
penalty of deviating from the predicted labels determined by the network. In
addition, we introduce a confidence-aware scheduler into the loss of the
network to adaptively perform easy-to-hard learning for different labels.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed G2NetPL outperforms many
state-of-the-art multi-label classification methods under various partial-label
settings on three different datasets.

interpretability of the mechanism and properties of the learned representations
by such a scheme are so far not well-explored. In this work, through
comprehensive experiments and empirical studies on Masked Autoencoders (MAE),
we address two critical questions to explore the behaviors of the learned
representations: (i) Are the latent representations in Masked Autoencoders
linearly separable if the input is a mixture of two images instead of one? This
can be concrete evidence used to explain why MAE-learned representations have
superior performance on downstream tasks, as proven by many literature
impressively. (ii) What is the degree of semantics encoded in the latent
feature space by Masked Autoencoders? To explore these two problems, we propose
a simple yet effective Interpretable MAE (i-MAE) framework with a two-way image
reconstruction and a latent feature reconstruction with distillation loss to
help us understand the behaviors inside MAE's structure. Extensive experiments
are conducted on CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet-1K datasets to verify
the observations we discovered. Furthermore, in addition to qualitatively
analyzing the characteristics of the latent representations, we examine the
existence of linear separability and the degree of semantics in the latent
space by proposing two novel metrics. The surprising and consistent results
across the qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that i-MAE is a
superior framework design for interpretability research of MAE frameworks, as
well as achieving better representational ability. Code is available at

topic. However, current methods with fully-supervised models require manually
annotated point-wise supervision which is extremely user-unfriendly and
time-consuming to obtain. As such, training 3D scene parsing models with sparse
supervision is an intriguing alternative. We term this task as data-efficient
3D scene parsing and propose an effective two-stage framework named VIBUS to
resolve it by exploiting the enormous unlabeled points. In the first stage, we
perform self-supervised representation learning on unlabeled points with the
proposed Viewpoint Bottleneck loss function. The loss function is derived from
an information bottleneck objective imposed on scenes under different
viewpoints, making the process of representation learning free of degradation
and sampling. In the second stage, pseudo labels are harvested from the sparse
labels based on uncertainty-spectrum modeling. By combining data-driven
uncertainty measures and 3D mesh spectrum measures (derived from normal
directions and geodesic distances), a robust local affinity metric is obtained.
Finite gamma/beta mixture models are used to decompose category-wise
distributions of these measures, leading to automatic selection of thresholds.
We evaluate VIBUS on the public benchmark ScanNet and achieve state-of-the-art
results on both validation set and online test server. Ablation studies show

wavefront correction of a focused Gaussian beam using a spatial light modulator
(SLM). The beam is perturbed with a transparent optical element (sparse) or a
random scatterer (both prevent focusing at a single spot). The phase
corrections are implemented with different basis sizes ($N=64, 256, 1024,
4096$) and the phase contribution of each basis element is measured with 3 step
interferometry. The field is reconstructed from the complete $3N$ measurements
and the correction is implemented by projecting the conjugate phase at the SLM.
Our experiments show that in general, the Hadamard basis measurements yield
better corrections because every element spans the relevant area of the SLM,
reducing the noise in the interferograms. % In contrast, the canonical basis
has the fundamental limitation that the area of the elements is proportional to
$1/N$, and requires dimensions that are compatible with the spatial period of
the grating. In the case of the random scatterer, we were only able to get
reasonable corrections with the Hadamard basis and the intensity of the
corrected spot increased monotonically with $N$, which is consistent with fast
random changes in phase over small spatial scales. We also explore compressive
sensing with the Hadamard basis and find that the minimum compression ratio
needed to achieve corrections with similar quality to those that use the
complete measurements depend on the basis ordering. The best results are
reached in the case of the Hadamard-Walsh and cake cutting orderings.
Surprisingly, in the case of the random scatterer we find that moderate
compression ratios on the order of $10-20\%$ ($N=4096$) allow to recover
focused spots, although as expected, the maximum intensities increase
monotonically with the number of measurements due to the non sparsity of the

machine learning to extract cosmological information through forward modelling,
by directly exploiting the spatial coordinates and other observed properties of
galaxies and galaxy clusters. Specifically, we investigated a new
representation of large-scale structure data in the form of graphs. This data
format can be directly fed to Graph Neural Networks, a recently proposed class
of supervised Deep Learning algorithms. We tested the method on dark matter
halo catalogues in different cosmologies, finding promising results. In
particular, the method can discriminate among different dark energy models with
high accuracy, through both binary classification ($99\%-$accuracy) and
multi-class classification ($97\%-$accuracy). Moreover, it provides constraints
on the value of $w_0$, through regression, with high precision.

the dynamics up to a fixed evolution time, independent of the system size. The
computational cost scales polynomially with the system size and the inverse of
the approximation error. In the case of local observables, we can extend the

one dimension, the resulting algorithm has a better dependence on the
approximation error than algorithms based on the Lieb-Robinson bound. Our

We consider series of simulations at multiple resolutions comparing
hydrodynamics, neutrino leakage scheme, leakage augmented with the M0 scheme
and the more consistent M1 transport scheme. Additionally, we consider the
impact of a sub-grid scheme for turbulent viscosity. We find that viscosity
helps to stabilise the remnant against gravitational collapse but grid
resolution has a larger impact than microphysics on the remnant's stability.
The gravitational wave (GW) energy correlates with the maximum remnant density,
that can be thus inferred from GW observations. M1 simulations shows the
emergence of a neutrino trapped gas that locally decreases the temperature a
few percent when compared to the other simulation series. This
out-of-thermodynamics equilibrium effect does not alter the GW emission at the
typical resolutions considered for mergers. Different microphysics treatments
impact significantly mass, geometry and composition of the remnant's disc and
ejecta. M1 simulations show systematically larger proton fractions. The
different ejecta compositions reflect into the nucleosynthesis yields, that are
robust only if both neutrino emission and absorption are simulated. Synthetic
kilonova light curves calculated by means of spherically-symmetric
radiation-hydrodynamics evolutions up to 15 days post-merger are mostly
sensitive to ejecta's mass and composition; they can be reliably predicted only
including the various ejecta components. We conclude that advanced microphysics
in combination with resolutions higher than current standards appear essential
for robust long-term evolutions and astrophysical predictions.

Hubble parameter in Big Bang cosmology. This wind radius is the vital, but
hard-to-constrain parameter in wind physics. We demonstrate the method using
spectra of 87 starburst galaxies at z=0.05-0.44, finding that winds accelerate
throughout the starburst phase and grow to typical radii of ~1 kpc in ~10 Myr.
Mass flow rates increase rapidly with time, and the mass-loading factor exceeds
unity at about 10 Myr - while still being accelerated, the gas will likely
unbind from the local potential and enrich the circumgalactic medium. We model
the mechanical energy available from stellar winds and supernovae, and estimate
that a negligible amount is accounted for in the cool outflow at early times.
However, the energy deposition increases rapidly and ~10% of the budget is

rapid advances in all-optical signal processing technologies has brought
opportunities to re-define the optical node architecture by upgrading its naive

optical channels in photonic domain. Specifically, all-optical channel (de-)
aggregation technologies have been remarkably advancing in recent years,
permitting two or more optical channels at lower bit-rate and/or modulation
formats could be all-optically aggregated to a single channel of higher-rate

for phenomenological understanding of the clustering of matter in the Universe.
While the halo model builds structures out of the superposition of haloes,
defining halo profiles in their outskirts - beyond their virial radii - becomes
increasingly ambiguous, as one cannot assign matter to individual haloes in a
clear way. In this paper, we tackle this question by using numerical N-body
simulations to find a systematic definition of mean halo profile that can be
extended to large radii. These profiles must be compensated and are the key
ingredients for the computation of cosmological correlation functions in the
Amended Halo Model. The latter, introduced in our earlier work
(arXiv:1912.04872), provides a more physically accurate phenomenological
description of nonlinear structure formation, which respects conservation laws
on large scales. Here, we extend this model from the matter auto-power spectrum
to the halo-matter cross-power spectra, using N-body simulations. We find that
the (dimensionless) compensated halo profile, $r^3 \times \rho(r)/M_{200c}$ has
a near-universal maximum in the small range $0.03-0.04$ around the virial
radius, $r \simeq r_{\rm 200c}$, independent of the halo mass. The profiles
cross zero into negative values in the halo outskirts, beyond 2-3$\times r_{\rm
200c}$, consistent with our previous results. We provide preliminary fitting
functions for compensated Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles, and this can be
used to compute more physical observables in the Amended Halo Model of large

imply the existence of a fundamental minimal length scale below which distances
cannot be resolved. One approach to realizing this minimum length scale is
construct a quantum field theory with a bandlimit on the field. We report on an
investigation of the effects of imposing a bandlimit on a field on a curved and
compact spacetime and how best to detect such a bandlimit if it exists. To
achieve this operationally, we couple two Gaussian-smeared UDW detectors to a
scalar field on a $S^2 \times R$ spherical spacetime through delta-switching.
The bandlimit is implemented through a cut-off of the allowable angular
momentum modes of the field. We observe that a number of features of single
detector response in the spherical case are similar to those in flat spacetime,
including the dependence on the geometry of the detector, and that smaller
detectors couple more strongly to the field, leading to an optimal size for
bandlimit detection. We find that in flat spacetime squeezed detectors are more
senstive to the bandlimit provided they are larger than the optimal size;
however, in spherical spacetime the bandlimit itself determines if squeezing
improves the sensitivity. We also explore setups with two detectors, noting
that in the spherical case, due to its compact nature, there is a lack of
dissipation of any perturbation to the field, which results in locally excited
signals being refocused at the poles. Quite strikingly, this feature can be
exploited to significantly improve bandlimit detection via field mediated
signalling. Moreover, we find that squeezing on a sphere introduces extra
anisotropies that could be exploited to amplify or weaken the response of the
second detector.

unavoidable errors in near-term quantum computing using no or few additional
quantum resources, in contrast to fault-tolerant schemes that come along with
heavy overheads. Error mitigation has been successfully applied to reduce noise
in near-term applications. In this work, however, we identify strong
limitations to the degree to which quantum noise can be effectively `undone'
for larger system sizes. We set up a framework that rigorously captures large
classes of error mitigation schemes in use today. The core of our argument
combines fundamental limits of statistical inference with a construction of
families of random circuits that are highly sensitive to noise. We show that
even at poly log log n depth, a super-polynomial number of samples is needed in
the worst case to estimate the expectation values of noiseless observables, the
principal task of error mitigation. Notably, our construction implies that
scrambling due to noise can kick in at exponentially smaller depths than
previously thought. They also impact other near-term applications, constraining
kernel estimation in quantum machine learning, causing an earlier emergence of

efficiency also applies to the RSES of lowest Landau level (LLL) projected CF

approximations that generalize the Jain Kamilla (JK) projection. This work is a
careful study of how this approximation should be made. We identify the
approximation closest in spirit to JK projection and perform tests of the
approximations involved in the projection by comparing the MC results with the
RSES obtained from computationally expensive but exact methods. We present the

matter (CDM) model motivated by small-scale discrepancies in low-mass galaxies.
Composed of ultra-light (mass $\sim 10^{-22}$ eV) axions with kpc-scale de
Broglie wavelengths, this is one of a class of candidates that predicts that
the first collapsed objects form in relatively massive dark matter halos. This
implies that the formation history of the first stars and galaxies would be
very different, potentially placing strong constraints on such models. Here we
numerically simulate the formation of the first stars in an FDM cosmology,
following the collapse in a representative volume all the way down to
primordial protostar formation including a primordial non-equilibrium chemical
network and cooling for the first time. We find two novel results: first, the
large-scale collapse results in a very thin and flat gas ""pancake""; second,
despite the very different cosmology, this pancake fragments until it forms
protostellar objects indistinguishable from those in CDM. Combined, these
results indicate that the first generation of stars in this model are also
likely to be massive and, because of the sheet morphology, do not
self-regulate, resulting in a massive Pop III starburst. We estimate the total
number of first stars forming in this extended structure to be $10^4$ over 20
Myr using a simple model to account for the ionizing feedback from the stars,
and should be observable with JWST. These predictions provide a potential
smoking gun signature of FDM and similar dark matter candidates.

X-ray and radio emission mainly powered by the decay of their immense magnetic
fields. Many attributes of magnetars remain poorly understood: spin-down
glitches or the sudden reductions in the star's angular momentum, radio bursts
reminiscent of extra-galactic Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and transient pulsed
radio emission lasting months to years. Here we unveil the detection of a large
spin-down glitch event ($|\Delta\nu/\nu| = 5.8_{-1.6}^{+2.6}\times10^{-6}$)
from the magnetar SGR~1935+2154 on 2020 October 5 (+/- 1 day). We find no
change to the source persistent surface thermal or magnetospheric X-ray

subsequent days, the magnetar emitted three FRB-like radio bursts followed by a
month long episode of pulsed radio emission. Given the rarity of spin-down
glitches and radio signals from magnetars, their approximate synchronicity
suggests an association, providing pivotal clues to their origin and triggering
mechanisms, with ramifications to the broader magnetar and FRB populations. We
postulate that impulsive crustal plasma shedding close to the magnetic pole
generates a wind that combs out magnetic field lines, rapidly reducing the
star's angular momentum, while temporarily altering the magnetospheric field
geometry to permit the pair creation needed to precipitate radio emission.

  Volatility Dynamics of Financial Data",,,,,"stat.ME stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most important features of financial time series data is
volatility. There are often structural changes in volatility over time, and an
accurate estimation of the volatility of financial time series requires careful
identification of change-points. A common approach to modeling the volatility
of time series data is the well-known GARCH model. Although the problem of
change-point estimation of volatility dynamics derived from the GARCH model has
been considered in the literature, these approaches rely on parametric
assumptions of the conditional error distribution, which are often violated in
financial time series. This may lead to inaccuracies in change-point detection
resulting in unreliable GARCH volatility estimates. This paper introduces a
novel change-point detection algorithm based on a semiparametric GARCH model.
The proposed method retains the structural advantages of the GARCH process
while incorporating the flexibility of nonparametric conditional error
distribution. The approach utilizes a penalized likelihood derived from a
semiparametric GARCH model and an efficient binary segmentation algorithm. The
results show that in terms of change-point estimation and detection accuracy,
the semiparametric method outperforms the commonly used Quasi-MLE (QMLE) and
other variations of GARCH models in wide-ranging scenarios.

compose them via closed-loop iterative consensus optimization. The generator
constructs proposals and the scorers iteratively provide feedback to refine the

conversion processes. Unlike conservation laws, a topological constraint
concerns with the conserved properties under continuous deformation, and can be
regarded as a new indispensable degree of freedom to describe multi-frequency
processes. We illustrate such a paradigm by considering sum frequency
generation under a multi-frequency pump wave, showing that, akin topological
phases in topological insulators, topological phase transitions can be observed
in the frequency conversion process both at classical and quantum level.

dynamical evolution in detail represents a key step in the understanding of
their formation. Studying the dissipation of tides occurring both in the host
star and in the planets is of great relevance in order to investigate the
distribution of the angular momentum occurring among the objects populating the
system and to studying the evolution of the orbital parameters. From a
theoretical point of view, the dissipation of tides throughout a body may be
studied by relying on the so-called phase or time-lag equilibrium tides model
in which the reduced tidal quality factor Q'p, or equivalently the product
between the love number and the time lag (k2DeltaT), describe how efficiently
tides are dissipated within the perturbed body. Constraining these factors by
looking at the current configuration of the exoplanetary system is extremely
challenging, and simulations accounting for the evolution of the system as a
whole might help to shed some light on the mechanisms governing this process.
Aims. We aim to constrain the tidal dissipation factors of hot-Jupiter-like
planets by studying the orbital evolution of Kepler-91b. Methods. We firstly
carried out a detailed asteroseismc characterisation of Kepler-91 and computed
a dedicated stellar model using both classical and astereoseismic constraints.
We then coupled the evolution of the star to the one of the planets by means of
our orbital evolution code and studied the evolution of the system by
accounting for tides dissipated both in the planet and in the host star.
Results. We found that the maximum value for k2DeltaT (or equivalently the
minimum value for Q'p) determining the efficiency of equilibrium tides
dissipation occurring within Kepler-91b is 0.4 pm 0.25 s (4.5+5.8 * 10^5).

which all points of the manifold (each configuration in this case) can be
naturally projected to a manifold called the {\it base manifold}, which in our

sub-motion and a deformable one in a completely coordinate free way. As a
consequence of that it is then possible to properly define a pure deformation
space on which an elastic energy can be defined. This will be shown using screw
theory \cite{Ball:1900}, which is vastly used in the analysis of rigid body

simultaneous training in Federated Learning (FL) via a clustering framework. We
define a new clustering model for FL based on the (optimal) local models of the
users: two users belong to the same cluster if their local models are close;
otherwise they belong to different clusters. A standard algorithm for clustered
FL is proposed in \cite{ghosh_efficient_2021}, called \texttt{IFCA}, which
requires \emph{suitable} initialization and the knowledge of hyper-parameters
like the number of clusters (which is often quite difficult to obtain in
practical applications) to converge. We propose an improved algorithm,
\emph{Successive Refine Federated Clustering Algorithm} (\texttt{SR-FCA}),
which removes such restrictive assumptions. \texttt{SR-FCA} treats each user as
a singleton cluster as an initialization, and then successively refine the
cluster estimation via exploiting similar users belonging to the same cluster.
In any intermediate step, \texttt{SR-FCA} uses a robust federated learning
algorithm within each cluster to exploit simultaneous training and to correct
clustering errors. Furthermore, \texttt{SR-FCA} does not require any
\emph{good} initialization (warm start), both in theory and practice. We show
that with proper choice of learning rate, \texttt{SR-FCA} incurs arbitrarily
small clustering error. Additionally, we validate the performance of our
algorithm on standard FL datasets in non-convex problems like neural nets, and
we show the benefits of \texttt{SR-FCA} over baselines.

between the fluctuation amplitudes of gas density, $\delta\rho/\rho$, pressure,
$\delta P/P$, X-ray surface brightness, Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) y-parameter, and
the characteristic Mach number of gas motions, $M_{\rm 1d}$. In relaxed
clusters, accounting for halo ellipticities reduces $\delta\rho/\rho$ or
$\delta P/P$ by a factor of up to 2 within $r_{500c}$. We confirm a strong
linear correlation between $\delta\rho/\rho$ (or $\delta P/P$) and $M_{\rm 1d}$
in relaxed clusters, with the proportionality coefficient $\eta \approx 1$. For
unrelaxed clusters, the correlation is less strong and has a larger
$\eta\approx 1.3\pm 0.5$ ($1.5\pm0.5$) for $\delta\rho/\rho$ ($\delta P/P$).
Examination of the power-law scaling of $M_{\rm 1d}$ with $\delta\rho/\rho$
shows that it is almost linear for relaxed clusters, while for the unrelaxed
ones, it is closer to $\delta\rho/\rho\propto M_{\rm 1d}^2$, supporting an
increasing role of non-linear terms and compressive modes. In agreement with
previous studies, we observe a strong correlation of $M_{\rm 1d}$ with radius.
Correcting for these correlations leaves a residual scatter in $M_{\rm 1d}$ of
$\sim 4 (7)$ per cent for relaxed (perturbed) clusters. Hydrostatic mass bias
correlates with $M_{\rm 1d}$ as strongly as with $\delta\rho/\rho$ in relaxed
clusters. The residual scatters after correcting for derived trends is $\sim
6-7$ per cent. These predictions can be verified with existing X-ray and SZ
observations of galaxy clusters combined with forthcoming velocity measurements
with X-ray microcalorimeters.

consisting of nodes hosted by many individuals and small enterprises,
reawakening the decades-old dream of open networking. These networks have been
deployed in an organic, distributed manner and are driven by new economic
models resting on tokenized incentives. A critical requirement for the
incentives to scale is the ability to prove network performance in a
decentralized trustfree manner, i.e., a Byzantine fault tolerant network
telemetry system. In this paper, we present a Proof of Backhaul (PoB) protocol
which measures the bandwidth of the (broadband) backhaul link of a wireless
access point, termed prover, in a decentralized and trustfree manner. In
particular, our proposed protocol is the first one to satisfy the following two
properties: (1) Trustfree. Bandwidth measurement is secure against Byzantine
attacks by collaborations of challenge servers and the prover. (2) Open. The
barrier-to-entry for being a challenge server is low; there is no requirement
of having a low latency and high throughput path to the measured link. At a
high-level, our protocol aggregates the challenge traffic from multiple
challenge servers and uses cryptographic primitives to ensure that a subset of
challengers or, even challengers and provers, cannot maliciously modify results
in their favor. A formal security model allows us to establish guarantees of
accurate bandwidth measurement as a function of the fraction of malicious
actors. Our evaluation shows that our PoB protocol can verify backhaul
bandwidth of up to 1000 Mbps with less than 8% error using measurements lasting
only 100 ms. The measurement accuracy is not affected in the presence of
corrupted challengers. Importantly, the basic verification protocol lends
itself to a minor modification that can measure available bandwidth even in the
presence of cross-traffic.

quantum information processing which distinguishes quantum dynamics and
information from their classical counterparts. In this article we determine the
coherence requirements to communicate quantum information in a broad setting
encompassing monitored quantum dynamics and quantum error correction codes. We
determine these requirements by considering hybrid circuits that are generated
by a quantum information game played between two opponents, Alice and Eve, who
compete by applying unitaries and measurements on a fixed number of qubits.
Alice applies unitaries in an attempt to maintain quantum channel capacity,
while Eve applies measurements in an attempt to destroy it. By limiting the
coherence generating or destroying operations available to each opponent, we
determine Alice's coherence requirements. When Alice plays a random strategy
aimed at mimicking generic monitored quantum dynamics, we discover a
coherence-tuned phase transitions in entanglement and quantum channel capacity.
We then derive a theorem giving the minimum coherence required by Alice in any
successful strategy, and conclude by proving that coherence sets an upper bound
on the code distance in any stabelizer quantum error correction codes. Such
bounds provide a rigorous quantification of the coherence resource requirements
for quantum communication and error correction.

morphological characteristics of environmentally released nanoplastics is
understudied. Using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations, we modeled
the interaction between hydrophobic nanotetrahedra and a cell membrane,
featuring high shape anisotropy and large surface curvature seen for
environmental nanoplastics. We observe robust uptake of nanotetrahedra with
sharp vertices and edges by the lipid membrane. Two local energy minimum
configurations of nanotetrahedra embedded in the membrane bilayer were
identified for particles of large sizes. Further analysis of particle dynamics
within the membrane shows that the two interaction states exhibit distinct
translational and rotational dynamics in the directions normal and parallel to
the plane of the membrane. The membrane confinement significantly arrests the
out-of-plane motion, resulting in caged translation and subdiffusive rotation.
While the in-plane diffusion remains Brownian, we find that the translational
and rotational modes decouple from each other as nanotetrahedra size increases.
The rotational diffusion decreases by a greater extent compared to the
translational diffusion, deviating from the continuum theory predictions. These
results provide fundamental insight into the shape effect on the nanoparticle
dynamics in crowded lipid membranes.

other dependencies between compositions. CAPE learns to identify this structure

feedback. For each jet, there is one loop involving with disturbances which
originate in that jet and arrive at its own receptivity point in-phase
(self-excitation). The other loop is associated with free-stream acoustic waves
that radiate from the other jet, reinforcing the self-excited screech
(cross-excitation). In this work, the role of the free-stream acoustic mode and
the guided jet mode as a closure mechanism for overexpanded twin rectangular
jet screech is explored by identifying eligible points of return for each path,
where upstream waves propagating from such a point arrive at the receptivity
location with an appropriate phase relation. Screech tones generated by these
jets are found to be intermittent with an antisymmetric flapping as a dominant
coupling mode at this frequency. Instantaneous phase difference between the
twin jets computed by the Hilbert transform suggests that a competition between
antisymmetric and symmetric coupling is responsible for the intermittency. To
model each component of the screech feedback while ensuring perfect
phase-locking, an ensemble average of leading spectral proper orthogonal
decomposition modes obtained from several segments of large-eddy simulations
data that correspond to periods of invariant phase difference is used after a
streamwise wavenumber decomposition. The present analysis shows that most of
the identified points of return for the cross-excitation are synchronised with
the guided jet mode self-excitation, supporting that it is preferred in closing
rectangular twin-jet screech coupling.

significant perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) core as the result of
color gauge invariance and of the values of chiral and gluon vacuum
condensates. The evaluation within the method of dispersion sum rules (DSR) of
the vacuum matrix elements of the correlator of local currents with the proper
quantum numbers leads to the value of the radius of the pQCD core of a nucleon
of about 0.4--0.5 fm. The selection of the initial and final states allows to
select processes in which the pQCD core of the projectile gives the dominant
contribution to the process. It is explained that the transparency of nuclear
matter for the propagation of a spatially small and color-neutral wave packet
of quarks and gluons -- a color transparency (CT) phenomenon -- for a group of
hard processes off nuclear targets can be derived in the form of the QCD
factorization theorem accounting for the color screening phenomenon Based on
the success of the method of DSR, we argue that a pQCD core in a hadron wave
function is surrounded by the layer consisting of quarks interacting with quark
and gluon condensates. As a result, in the quasi-elastic processes $e+A\to e'+N
+(A-1)^{*}$, the quasi-Feynman mechanism could be dominating in a wide range of
the momentum transfer squared, $Q^2$. In this scenario, a virtual photon is
absorbed by a single quark, which carries a large fraction of the momentum of
the nucleon and dominates in a wide range of $Q^2$. CT should reveal itself in
these processes at an extremely large $Q^2$ as the consequence of the presence
of the Sudakov form factors, which squeeze a nucleon.

fractional online matching problem with a tweak, where the decision maker can
recall (i.e., buyback) any fraction of an offline resource that is
pre-allocated to an earlier online vertex; however, by doing so not only the
decision maker loses the previously allocated reward (which equates the
edge-weight), it also has to pay a non-negative constant factor $f$ of this
edge-weight as an extra penalty. Parameterizing the problem by the buyback
factor $f$, our main result is obtaining optimal competitive algorithms for all
possible values of $f$ through a novel primal-dual family of algorithms. We
establish the optimality of our results by obtaining separate lower-bounds for
each of small and large buyback factor regimes, and showing how our primal-dual
algorithm exactly matches this lower-bound by appropriately tuning a parameter
as a function of $f$. We further study lower and upper bounds on the
competitive ratio in variants of this model, e.g., single-resource with
different demand sizes, or matching with deterministic integral allocations. We
show how algorithms in the our family of primal-dual algorithms can obtain the
exact optimal competitive ratio in all of these variants -- which in turn
demonstrates the power of our algorithmic framework for online resource

In real-world scenarios, the DVL may receive less than three beam velocities if
the AUV operates in complex underwater environments. In such conditions, the

in general the Hamiltonian parameters may be accurately estimated from a modest

the single-particle Hamiltonian, where because of the topological obstruction
convergence is non-uniform across the Brillouin zone. We observe, however, that
mixed position and momentum space representations may be used to avoid this

Magnification from gravitational lensing permits the galaxy to be spatially

Rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectra from Magellan target ten different
regions along the lensed Arc, including six multiple images of the LyC leaking
region, as well as four regions that do not show LyC emission. The rest-frame
optical spectra of the ionizing photon emitting regions reveal a blue-shifted
($\Delta V$=27 km s$^{-1}$) broad emission component (FWHM=327 km s$^{-1}$)
comprising 55% of the total [OIII] line flux, in addition to a narrow component
(FWHM = 112 km s$^{-1}$), suggesting the presence of strong highly ionized gas
outflows. This is consistent with the high-velocity ionized outflow inferred
from the rest-frame UV spectra. In contrast, the broad emission component is
less prominent in the non-leaking regions, comprising $\sim$26% of total [OIII]
line flux. The high ionization absorption lines are prominent in both leaker
and non-leaker but low ionization absorption lines are very weak in the leaker,
suggesting that the line of sight gas is highly ionized in the leaker. Analyses
of stellar wind features reveal that the stellar population of the LyC leaking
regions is considerably younger ($\sim$3 Myr) than the non-leaking regions

search on nonsmooth robust control synthesis have not been fully understood.
The optimal $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control framework aims at designing a policy
to minimize the closed-loop $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norm, and is arguably the most
fundamental robust control paradigm. In this work, we show that direct policy
search is guaranteed to find the global solution of the robust
$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ state-feedback control design problem. Notice that policy
search for optimal $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control leads to a constrained
nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem, where the nonconvex feasible set
consists of all the policies stabilizing the closed-loop dynamics. We show that
for this nonsmooth optimization problem, all Clarke stationary points are
global minimum. Next, we identify the coerciveness of the closed-loop
$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ objective function, and prove that all the sublevel sets
of the resultant policy search problem are compact. Based on these properties,
we show that Goldstein's subgradient method and its implementable variants can
be guaranteed to stay in the nonconvex feasible set and eventually find the
global optimal solution of the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ state-feedback synthesis
problem. Our work builds a new connection between nonconvex nonsmooth

infinitely many conserved charges associated with large gauge transformations
or diffeomorphisms that are nontrivial at infinity. To what extent do these
charges constrain the scattering in these theories? It has been claimed in the
literature that the constraints are trivial, due to a decoupling of hard and
soft sectors for which the conserved charges constrain only the dynamics in the
soft sector. We show that the argument for this decoupling fails due to the
failure in infinite dimensions of a property of symplectic geometry which holds
in finite dimensions. Specializing to electromagnetism coupled to a massless
charged scalar field in four dimensional Minkowski spacetime, we show
explicitly that the two sectors are always coupled using a perturbative
classical computation of the scattering map. Specifically, while the two
sectors are uncoupled at low orders, they are coupled at quartic order via the
electromagnetic memory effect. This coupling cannot be removed by adjusting the
definitions of the hard and soft sectors (which includes the classical analog
of dressing the hard degrees of freedom). We conclude that the conserved
charges yield nontrivial constraints on the scattering of hard degrees of
freedom. This conclusion should also apply to gravitational scattering and to
black hole formation and evaporation.
  In developing the classical scattering theory, we show that generic Lorenz
gauge solutions fail to satisfy the matching condition on the vector potential
at spatial infinity proposed by Strominger to define the field configuration
space, and we suggest a way to remedy this. We also show that when soft degrees
of freedom are present, the order at which nonlinearities first arise in the
scattering map is second order in Lorenz gauge, but can be third order in other
gauges.

fundamental unit of topological quantum computing. However, some of the
experiments with ferromagnetic chains show a more complicated picture. Due to
tiny gap sizes and hence long coherence lengths MZMs might hybridize and lose
their topological protection. Recent experiments on a niobium surface have
shown that both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic chains may be engineered,
with the magnetic order depending on the crystallographic direction of the
chain. While ferromagnetic chains are well understood, antiferromagnetic chains
are less so. Here we study two models inspired by the niobium surface: a
minimal model to elucidate the general topological properties of
antiferromagnetic chains, and an extended model to more closely simulate a real
system by mimicking the proximity effect. We find that in general for
antiferromagnetic chains the topological gap is larger than for ferromagnetic
ones and thus coherence lengths are shorter for antiferromagnetic chains,
yielding more pronounced localization of MZMs in these chains. While
topological phases for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic chains both
depend on the magnetic moment of the adatoms and the chemical potential, we
find that antiferromagnetic chains also have a strong dependence on the
magnitude of Rashba spin-orbit coupling at the surface.

medical research. Repeated assessments of a marker outcome are often used to
evaluate disease progression, and the primary research question is to identify
factors associated with the longitudinal trajectory of this marker. Our work is
motivated by diabetic kidney disease (DKD), where serial measures of estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are the longitudinal measure of kidney
function, and there is notable interest in identifying factors, such as
metabolites, that are prognostic for DKD progression. Linear mixed models (LMM)
with serial marker outcomes (e.g., eGFR) are a standard approach for prognostic
model development, namely by evaluating the time and prognostic factor (e.g.,
metabolite) interaction. However, two-stage methods that first estimate
individual-specific eGFR slopes, and then use these as outcomes in a regression
framework with metabolites as predictors are easy to interpret and implement
for applied researchers. Herein, we compared the LMM and two-stage methods, in
terms of bias and mean squared error via analytic methods and simulations,
allowing for irregularly spaced measures and missingness. Our findings provide
novel insights into when two-stage methods are suitable longitudinal prognostic
modeling alternatives to the LMM. Notably, our findings generalize to other
disease studies.

available array elements, and array aperture are studied for the angular
beamforming performance metrics such as, beam width, the peak to sidelobe ratio
(PSLR), and grating lobe limited field of view. The limiting constraints, the
physical size of elements, and mutual coupling are also considered. Thinning of
fully populated uniform MIMO antenna arrays to form effective uniform sparse
arrays (USA), as the term proposed here, are examined as for their capability
of improving usable field of view (uFOV), beamwidth (BW), and peak-to-side
lobe-ratio (PSLR) using fewer physical antenna elements, simultaneously. Sparse
arrays require much less array elements to outperform uniform linear (ULA) and
rectangular arrays (URA) for their beamwidths. Further, a rigorious design
procedure considering the physical size limitations is currently unavailable.
Here, we present a practical design architecture of such a uniform sparse array

novel uniform sparse arrays are compared with the standard ULA and URAs. It is
shown that design of an array with small inter-element spacings avoiding any

large. Expanding the available elements to a much larger apertures provides
much better angular resolution. However, it is also shown that these advantages

precision of $9\times 10^{-12}$. $E_{\text{Pb}}$ and $E_{\text{Xe}}$ have been
computed with an uncertainty of 9.1 eV and 2.1 eV, respectively, yielding
$207.976\,650\,571(14)$ u (u$=9.314\,941\,024\,2(28)\times 10^{8}$ eV/c$^2$)

improves the mass precision of 14 nuclides in the region of Z=81-84 and is the
most precise mass value with A>200. Thus, the measurement establishes a new
region of reference mass values which can be used e.g. for precision mass
determination of transuranium nuclides, including the superheavies.

$\tilde{O}$ hides logarithm factors, $M$ is the number of contexts, $S$ is the

$\Gamma \le S$ is the maximum transition degree of any state-action pair, and
$\mathsf{Var}^\star$ is a variance quantity describing the determinism of the
LMDP. The regret bound only scales logarithmically with the planning horizon,
thus yielding the first (nearly) horizon-free regret bound for LMDP. This is
also the first problem-dependent regret bound for LMDP. Key in our proof is an
analysis of the total variance of alpha vectors (a generalization of value
functions), which is handled with a truncation method. We complement our
positive result with a novel $\Omega(\sqrt{\mathsf{Var}^\star M S A K})$ regret
lower bound with $\Gamma = 2$, which shows our upper bound minimax optimal when
$\Gamma$ is a constant for the class of variance-bounded LMDPs. Our lower bound
relies on new constructions of hard instances and an argument inspired by the

Alternatively, one can treat the entire object as unknown and use a more

Both lead to strongly nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problems for which
recursive linearization provides a useful framework for numerical analysis.

one more variable significantly enhances the prediction of the other variable

not spread globally over the force network. For the changes that become global,
we find a sharp critical value for their size. If the size of a global change

long motivated research into their potentially hazardous effects on Earth and
analogous environments. Much of this research has focused primarily on the
atmospheric damage associated with the prompt arrival of ionizing photons
within days or months of the initial outburst, and the high-energy cosmic rays
that arrive thousands of years after the explosion. In this study, we turn the
focus to persistent X-ray emission, arising in certain SNe that have
interactions with a dense circumstellar medium, and observed months and/or
years after the initial outburst. The sustained high X-ray luminosity leads to
large doses of ionizing radiation out to formidable distances. We provide an
assessment of the threat posed by these X-ray luminous SNe by analyzing the
collective X-ray observations from Chandra, Swift-XRT, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and
others. We find that this threat is particularly acute for SNe showing evidence
of strong circumstellar interaction, such as Type IIn explosions, which have
significantly larger ranges of influence than previously expected, and lethal
consequences up to $\sim$ 50 pc away. Furthermore, X-ray bright SNe could pose
a substantial and distinct threat to terrestrial biospheres, and tighten the
Galactic habitable zone. We urge follow-up X-ray observations of interacting
SNe for months and years after the explosion to shed light on the physical
nature of the emission and its full time evolution, and to clarify the danger
that these events pose for life in our Galaxy and other star-forming regions.

characterize the graph selection performance using the minimum pairwise sample

method and an affiliated FDR control procedure, where the variance of each edge
depends on the sample sizes associated with corresponding neighbors. We prove
statistical validity under erose measurements, thanks to careful localized
edge-wise analysis and disentangling the dependencies across the graph.
Finally, through simulation studies and a real neuroscience data example, we
demonstrate the advantages of our inference methods for graph selection from

  this paper",,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Derivatives are a key nonparametric functional in wide-ranging applications
where the rate of change of an unknown function is of interest. In the Bayesian
paradigm, Gaussian processes (GPs) are routinely used as a flexible prior for
unknown functions, and are arguably one of the most popular tools in many
areas. However, little is known about the optimal modelling strategy and
theoretical properties when using GPs for derivatives. In this article, we
study a plug-in strategy by differentiating the posterior distribution with GP
priors for derivatives of any order. This practically appealing plug-in GP
method has been previously perceived as suboptimal and degraded, but this is
not necessarily the case. We provide posterior contraction rates for plug-in
GPs and establish that they remarkably adapt to derivative orders. We show that
the posterior measure of the regression function and its derivatives, with the
same choice of hyperparameter that does not depend on the order of derivatives,
converges at the minimax optimal rate up to a logarithmic factor for functions
in certain classes. This to the best of our knowledge provides the first
positive result for plug-in GPs in the context of inferring derivative
functionals, and leads to a practically simple nonparametric Bayesian method
with guided hyperparameter tuning for simultaneously estimating the regression
function and its derivatives. Simulations show competitive finite sample
performance of the plug-in GP method. A climate change application on analyzing
the global sea-level rise is discussed.

both modes the fragments eventually become embedded in a quasi-steady accretion

The disks/toroids are Toomre stable but the accreted pre-existing fragments are

converts nearly 100 percent of the gas mass into a few massive stars forming
near the disk center. Large and massive disks around high-mass stars are
supported by magnetic pressure in the outer disk, at radii >200-1000 AU, and
turbulent pressure in the inner disk. The most massive core accretes several
times more mass than its initial mass, forming a (proto)star cluster of 8
massive stars enshrouded by a toroid, suggesting a competitive accretion
scenario for ultra-high-mass star formation. We also find that the HII regions
produced by a single massive star remain trapped in the dense circumstellar
disks for a few hundred kiloyears, while the dynamic motions of massive stars
in wide binaries or multiple systems displace the stars from the densest parts

population properties of compact binaries with gravitational waves. The basic
premise is to infer the unknown prior distribution of binary black hole and/or
neutron star parameters such component masses, spin vectors, and redshift.
These distributions shed light on the fate of massive stars, how and where
binaries are assembled, and the evolution of the Universe over cosmic time.
Hierarchical analyses model the binary black hole population using a prior
distribution conditioned on hyper-parameters, which are inferred from the data.
However, a misspecified model can lead to faulty astrophysical inferences. In
this paper we answer the question: given some data, which prior
distribution--from the set of all possible prior distributions--produces the
largest possible population likelihood? This distribution (which is not a true
prior) is $\pistroke$ (pronounced ""pi stroke""), and the associated
\textit{maximum population likelihood} is $\Lstroke$ (pronounced ""L stroke"").
The structure of $\pistroke$ is a linear superposition of delta functions, a
result which follows from Carath{\'e}odory's theorem. We show how $\pistroke$
and $\Lstroke$ can be used for model exploration/criticism. We apply this
$\Lstroke$ formalism to study the population of binary black hole mergers
observed in LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA's third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog.

targets the extraction of an intermediate shared representation of speech and

identity mapping loss to preserve relevant characteristics of the input feature
after converting from one domain to another. As such, both approaches are
suitable to train end-to-end models on unpaired speech-text inputs. In this
paper, we exploit the advantages from both inter-domain loss and CycleGAN to
achieve better shared representation of unpaired speech and text inputs and
thus improve the speech-to-text mapping. Our experimental results on the WSJ

is a population-balanced contiguous region in which a majority of individuals
are of the same interest and in the minority of their respective districts;
such a set of individuals have a justified complaint with how the redistricting
plan was drawn. A redistricting plan with no deviating groups is called locally
fair. We show that the problem of auditing a given plan for local fairness is
NP-complete. We present an MCMC approach for auditing as well as ranking
redistricting plans. We also present a dynamic programming based algorithm for
the auditing problem that we use to demonstrate the efficacy of our MCMC
approach. Using these tools, we test local fairness on real-world election

stars in the binary: the primary star is found to be slightly hotter than the
main sequence turn off and there is a more substantial discrepancy in its
luminosity compared to models (model luminosities are too large by about 40%),
while the secondary star is oversized and cooler compared to other main
sequence stars in the same cluster. The evidence points to non-standard
evolution for both stars, but most plausible paths cannot explain the low
luminosity of the primary star.
  BD $+$37 410 only has one eclipse per cycle, but extensive spectroscopic
observations and the TESS light curve constrain the stellar masses well: $M_1 =

main sequence primary star near $2.9R_\odot$ definitively requires large
convective core overshooting ($> 0.2$ pressure scale heights) in models for its

$1.61\pm0.03\pm0.05$ Gyr (statistical and systematic uncertainties). Because
NGC 752 is currently undergoing the transition from non-degenerate to
degenerate He ignition of its red clump stars, BD $+$37 410 A directly

an evolutionary symbolic sparse regression approach for the system
identification of multibody systems. The procedure discovers equations of
motion and system parameters appearing as either constant values in function
arguments or coefficients of function expressions. A genetic programming
algorithm is written to generate symbolic function expressions, in which a
hard-thresholding regression method is embedded. In an evolutionary manner, the
complex functional forms, constant arguments, and unknown coefficients are
identified to eventually discover the governing equation of a given system. A
fitness measure is presented to promote parsimony in distilled equations and
reduction in fit-to-data error. Hybrid discrete-continuous dynamical systems
are also investigated, for which an approach is suggested to determine both

suggested evolutionary symbolic sparse regression methodology are evaluated in
a simulation environment. The capability of the developed approach is also
demonstrated by studying several multibody systems. The procedure is efficient

spectroscopy (XAS) measurements of the Mn L2,3 edges are widely used for this

decomposition of the mix valence states of Mn remains non-trivial. For both
EELS and XAS, 2+, 3+, 4+ reference spectra need to be taken on the same
instrument/beamline and preferably in the same experimental session because the
instrumental resolution and the energy axis offset could vary from one session
to another. To circumvent this hurdle, in this study, we adopted a deep
learning approach and developed a calibration-free and reference-free method to
decompose the oxidation state of Mn L2,3 edges for both EELS and XAS. To
synthesize physics-informed and ground-truth labeled training datasets, we
created a forward model that takes into account plural scattering,

created a 1.2 million-spectrum database with a three-element oxidation state

phase shifts with pertubing potential barrier is investigated. Through the
adjustment between uniform local perturbations and a Kerrlike nonlinearity of
the medium we find a rich set of dynamic profiles. We will show the existence
of different Hadamard quantum walking regimes, including those with mobile
soliton-like structures or self-trapped states. The latter is predominant for
perturbations with amplitudes that tend to $\varphi\rightarrow \pi/2$. In this
system, the qubit shows an unusual behavior as we increase the amplitudes of
the potential barriers, and displays a monotonic decrease in the self-trapping
$\varphi_c$ with respect to the nonlinear parameter. A chaotic-like regime
becomes predominant for intermediate nonlinearity values. Furthermore, we show
that by changing the quantum coins ($\theta$) a non-trivial dynamic arises,
where coins close to Pauli-X drives the system to a regime with predominant
soliton-like structures, while the chaotic behavior are restricted to a narrow
region in the $\chi$-$\varphi$ plane. We believe that is possible to implement
and observe the proprieties of this model in a integrated photonic system.

high-dimensional black-box optimization by sidestepping the need to globally
explore the search space. For objective functions whose gradient cannot be
evaluated directly, Bayesian optimization offers one solution -- we construct a
probabilistic model of the objective, design a policy to learn about the
gradient at the current location, and use the resulting information to navigate
the objective landscape. Previous work has realized this scheme by minimizing
the variance in the estimate of the gradient, then moving in the direction of
the expected gradient. In this paper, we re-examine and refine this approach.
We demonstrate that, surprisingly, the expected value of the gradient is not
always the direction maximizing the probability of descent, and in fact, these
directions may be nearly orthogonal. This observation then inspires an elegant
optimization scheme seeking to maximize the probability of descent while moving
in the direction of most-probable descent. Experiments on both synthetic and
real-world objectives show that our method outperforms previous realizations of
this optimization scheme and is competitive against other, significantly more
complicated baselines.

weather station network, a method was developed to estimate the heat emitted by
building facades, vegetation, and traffic. Before performing the analysis of
urban heat fluxes, it was observed that the surface temperature collected from
the observatory is sensitive to some variables. After the sensitivity analysis,
thermal images were calibrated against measurements of the surface temperature
in an outdoor environment. Finally, several contributors and mitigators of
urban heat islands were analyzed from heat fluxes assessed with thermal images
and weather data. According to thermal images collected by the rooftop
observatory, concrete walls are an important contributor to urban heat islands
due to the longwave radiation they emit at night. Vegetation, on the other
hand, seems to be an effective mitigator because of latent heat fluxes
generated by evapotranspiration. Traffic looks to be a negligible source of
heat if considered over a small portion of a road. In the future, more efforts
can be made to estimate the magnitude of the heat released by an

predicted via the band structure of the primitive unit cell, using Berry
curvature to predict localized interface or boundary states (as well as their
degree of localization), and the dispersion relation to predict propagating
group velocity. However, practical systems are finite in size and are driven by
excitation with a finite bandwidth as guaranteed by the Fourier uncertainty
principle. Hence, the dynamics predicted by the ideal infinite systems driven
at a given frequency deviate from practical topological systems driven across a
finite bandwidth. In this work, we demonstrate that the propagating topological
waves in a valley Hall system can be interpreted using the underlying linear
degenerate modal basis. We show that only a small subset of closely spaced
modes with the appropriate phase differences comprise the topological waves,
which enables the construction of analytical reduced-order models that
accurately capture the topological wave. This result is related to the sparse
density of the modal spectrum inside the topological band gap, which allows for
the energy to be carried nearly completely by a narrow band of spectrally
isolated eigenmodes that are spatially localized along the domain boundary.
This finding is subsequently employed to predict the true group velocity of
propagating topological waves with respect to input signal bandwidth and
frequency by matching each active mode to corresponding band locations of the
supercell dispersion diagram describing the semi-infinite system. Moreover, we
demonstrate that damped topological waves may be studied within the framework
of modal superposition by utilizing the damped modal spectrum to characterize
the variation topological wave group velocity and predict edge-to-bulk

sources from a finite window of measurements. In the case of narrowband sources
this can be reduced to the problem of spectral line estimation, where our goal
is simply to estimate the active frequencies from a weighted mixture of pure
sinusoids. There exists a plethora of modern and classical methods that
effectively solve this problem. However, for a wide variety of applications the
underlying sources are not narrowband and can have an appreciable amount of
bandwidth. In this work, we extend classical greedy algorithms for sparse
recovery (e.g., orthogonal matching pursuit) to localize broadband sources. We
leverage models for samples of broadband signals based on a union of Slepian
subspaces, which are more aptly suited for dealing with spectral leakage and
dynamic range disparities. We show that by using these models, our adapted
algorithms can successfully localize broadband sources under a variety of
adverse operating scenarios. Furthermore, we show that our algorithms
outperform complementary methods that use more standard Fourier models. We also
show that we can perform estimation from compressed measurements with little
loss in fidelity as long as the number of measurements are on the order of the
signal's implicit degrees of freedom. We conclude with an in-depth application
of these ideas to the problem of localization in multi-sensor arrays.

occurring for low-metallicity and/or hotter stars (1 $M_{\odot}$, $\sim$2$-$3
Gyr). Engulfment events occurring well after the zero-age main sequence produce
larger signals due to suppression of thermohaline mixing by gravitational
settling of helium (1 $M_{\odot}$, $\sim$1.5 Gyr). These results indicate that
it may be difficult to observe engulfment signatures in solar-like stars that

contrastive learning (TCL) at the instance and cluster level. Specifically, we
find that when the data is projected into a feature space with a dimensionality
of the target cluster number, the rows and columns of its feature matrix
correspond to the instance and cluster representation, respectively. Based on
the observation, for a given dataset, the proposed TCL first constructs
positive and negative pairs through data augmentations. Thereafter, in the row
and column space of the feature matrix, instance- and cluster-level contrastive
learning are respectively conducted by pulling together positive pairs while
pushing apart the negatives. To alleviate the influence of intrinsic
false-negative pairs and rectify cluster assignments, we adopt a
confidence-based criterion to select pseudo-labels for boosting both the
instance- and cluster-level contrastive learning. As a result, the clustering
performance is further improved. Besides the elegant idea of twin contrastive
learning, another advantage of TCL is that it could independently predict the
cluster assignment for each instance, thus effortlessly fitting online
scenarios. Extensive experiments on six widely-used image and text benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of TCL. The code will be released on GitHub.

computational cost limits the size and type of systems that can be studied.
Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a means to dramatically lower cost while
maintaining high accuracy. However, ML models often sacrifice interpretability
by using components, such as the artificial neural networks of deep learning,
that function as black boxes. These components impart the flexibility needed to
learn from large volumes of data but make it difficult to gain insight into the
physical or chemical basis for the predictions. Here, we demonstrate that
semiempirical quantum chemical (SEQC) models can learn from large volumes of
data without sacrificing interpretability. The SEQC model is that of Density
Functional based Tight Binding (DFTB) with fixed atomic orbital energies and
interactions that are one-dimensional functions of interatomic distance. This
model is trained to ab initio data in a manner that is analogous to that used
to train deep learning models. Using benchmarks that reflect the accuracy of
the training data, we show that the resulting model maintains a physically
reasonable functional form while achieving an accuracy, relative to coupled
cluster energies with a complete basis set extrapolation (CCSD(T)*/CBS), that
is comparable to that of density functional theory (DFT). This suggests that
trained SEQC models can achieve low computational cost and high accuracy
without sacrificing interpretability. Use of a physically-motivated model form
also substantially reduces the amount of ab initio data needed to train the
model compared to that required for deep learning models.

Control (DAC) policies, which are a widely studied class of policies for online

general class of systems: (i) matched disturbance system with general convex

applications, such as flow in porous, homogenous materials, coarse-graining
offers a sufficiently-accurate approximation of the solution. Unfortunately,
fractured systems cannot be accurately coarse-grained, as critical network
topology exists at the smallest scales, including topology that can push the
network across a percolation threshold. Therefore, new techniques are necessary
to accurately model important fracture systems. Quantum algorithms for solving
linear systems offer a theoretically-exponential improvement over their
classical counterparts, and in this work we introduce two quantum algorithms
for fractured flow. The first algorithm, designed for future quantum computers
which operate without error, has enormous potential, but we demonstrate that
current hardware is too noisy for adequate performance. The second algorithm,
designed to be noise resilient, already performs well for problems of small to

measurements have been performed for all prepared samples and interestingly, it
is observed that due to external pressure (i.e. strain) both the properties
change significantly. A rigorous theoretical calculation has also been carried
out to verify the experimental band gap obtained from optical absorption
spectroscopy. In case of pellet sample band gap decreases as compared to the
powder sample due to variation of pressure inside the structures. Role of
doping has also been investigated both in pellet and powder forms and we found
that the band gap decreases as the atomic number of dopants increases. A
cross-over behavior is seen in pellet samples on doping with Ni, Cu and Zn

Electrical resistivity measurements have been carried out for both pellet and

of resistivity is smaller while in the case of strain-free samples it is quite

Cram\'er-Rao lower bound under the small-angle approximation of attitude

In environments with many objects, often only a small number of them are moving

stochastic binary gates. Moreover, we propose a simplified architecture Simple
Variational Sparse Gating (SVSG) that removes the deterministic pathway of
previous models, resulting in a fully stochastic transition function that
leverages the VSG mechanism. We evaluate the two model architectures in the
BringBackShapes (BBS) environment that features a large number of moving

  To this end, we first identify the limitations of existing approaches that

1) those that hide each user's data from other users, but have a limited range
of verifiable operations (e.g., CONIKS, Merkle2, and Proofs of Liabilities),
and 2) those that support a wide range of verifiable operations, but make all

address the above limitations. The key component of TAP is a novel tree data
structure that supports efficient result verification, and relies on
independent audits that use zero-knowledge range proofs to show that the tree
is constructed correctly without revealing user data. TAP supports a broad
range of verifiable operations, including quantiles and sample standard

against two state-of-the-art baselines, namely IntegriDB and Merkle2, showing

their in-task performance. This allows us to use parameters from early

requires models to have relational reasoning and compositional generalization
capabilities. Previous work focuses on retrieving prototype sentences for the
provided concepts to assist generation. They first use a sparse retriever to
retrieve candidate sentences, then re-rank the candidates with a ranker.
However, the candidates returned by their ranker may not be the most relevant
sentences, since the ranker treats all candidates equally without considering
their relevance to the reference sentences of the given concepts. Another
problem is that re-ranking is very expensive, but only using retrievers will
seriously degrade the performance of their generation models. To solve these
problems, we propose the metric distillation rule to distill knowledge from the
metric (e.g., BLEU) to the ranker. We further transfer the critical knowledge
summarized by the distilled ranker to the retriever. In this way, the relevance
scores of candidate sentences predicted by the ranker and retriever will be
more consistent with their quality measured by the metric. Experimental results
on the CommonGen benchmark verify the effectiveness of our proposed method: (1)
Our generation model with the distilled ranker achieves a new state-of-the-art

related traits leads to an uneven distribution of genetic variation across

phenotype data to address these questions are now within reach, however,
incorporating these data into genetic analyses remains a challenge. Multi-trait
genetic analyses, of more than a handful of traits, are slow and often fail to
converge when fit with REML. This makes it challenging to estimate the genetic
covariance ($\mathbf{G}$) underlying thousands of traits, let alone study its
properties. We present a previously proposed REML algorithm that is feasible
for high dimensional genetic studies in the specific setting of a balanced
nested half-sib design, common of quantitative genetics. We show that it
substantially outperforms other common approaches when the number of traits is
large, and we use it to investigate the bias in estimated eigenvalues of
$\mathbf{G}$ and the size of the nearly-null genetic subspace. We show that the
high-dimensional biases observed are qualitatively similar to those
substantiated by asymptotic approximation in a simpler setting of a sample
covariance matrix based on i.i.d. vector observation, and that interpreting the
estimated size of the nearly-null genetic subspace requires considerable
caution in high-dimensional studies of genetic variation. Our results provide
the foundation for future research characterizing the asymptotic approximation

variable throughout the conversations. However, emotions change dynamically
between utterances, which makes previous works difficult to perceive the
emotion flow and predict the correct emotion of the target response, leading to
inappropriate response. Furthermore, simply importing commonsense knowledge
without harmonization may trigger the conflicts between knowledge and emotion,

process. To address the above problems, we propose a Serial Encoding and
Emotion-Knowledge interaction (SEEK) method for empathetic dialogue generation.
We use a fine-grained encoding strategy which is more sensitive to the emotion
dynamics (emotion flow) in the conversations to predict the emotion-intent
characteristic of response. Besides, we design a novel framework to model the
interaction between knowledge and emotion to generate more sensible response.
Extensive experiments on EmpatheticDialogues demonstrate that SEEK outperforms

Features) where each element corresponds to an object keypoint. We employ
lightweight deformable transformers and chain them together to iteratively
refine proposed poses over the sampled OSKFs. We achieve inference runtimes 2x
faster than the closest real-time state of the art methods while supporting up
to 21 objects on a single model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRT-6D by
performing extensive experiments on the LM-O and YCBV datasets. Compared to

promise of automatically detecting and correcting spelling errors in Chinese

scenarios in which complex and uncommon medical entities are easily misspelled.
Correcting the misspellings of medical entities is arguably more difficult than
those in the open domain due to its requirements of specificdomain knowledge.
In this work, we define the task of Medical-domain Chinese Spelling Correction
and propose MCSCSet, a large scale specialist-annotated dataset that contains
about 200k samples. In contrast to the existing open-domain CSC datasets,
MCSCSet involves: i) extensive real-world medical queries collected from
Tencent Yidian, ii) corresponding misspelled sentences manually annotated by
medical specialists. To ensure automated dataset curation, MCSCSet further
offers a medical confusion set consisting of the commonly misspelled characters
of given Chinese medical terms. This enables one to create the medical
misspelling dataset automatically. Extensive empirical studies have shown
significant performance gaps between the open-domain and medical-domain
spelling correction, highlighting the need to develop high-quality datasets
that allow for Chinese spelling correction in specific domains. Moreover, our
work benchmarks several representative Chinese spelling correction models,
establishing baselines for future work.

a comprehensive analysis to link speech representations to articulatory

based on a linear probing approach where we measure articulatory score as an
average correlation of linear mapping to EMA. We analyze a set of SSL models

Surprisingly, representations from the recent speech SSL models are highly

double-lobed structures associated with disk-like optical counterparts. After
systematically evaluating the probability of chance alignment between the radio
lobes and the optical counterparts, we obtain a sample of 18 objects likely to
have genuine associations. The host galaxies have unambiguous late-type
morphologies, including spiral arms, large-scale dust lanes among the edge-on
systems, and exceptionally weak bulges, as judged by the low global
concentrations, small global S\'{e}rsic indices, and low bulge-to-total light
ratios (median $B/T = 0.13$). With a median S\'{e}rsic index of 1.4 and low
effective surface brightnesses, the bulges are consistent with being pseudo
bulges. The majority of the hosts have unusually large stellar masses (median
$M_* = 1.3\times 10^{11}\, M_\odot$) and red optical colors (median $g-r =
0.69\,$mag), consistent with massive, quiescent galaxies on the red sequence.
We suggest that black hole mass (stellar mass) plays a fundamental role in
launching large-scale radio jets, and that the rarity of extended radio lobes
in late-type galaxies is the consequence of the steep stellar mass function at
the high-mass end. The disk radio galaxies have mostly Fanaroff-Riley type II
morphologies yet lower radio power than sources of a similar type traditionally
hosted by ellipticals. The radio jets show no preferential alignment with the
minor axis of the galactic bulge or disk, apart from a possible mild tendency
for alignment among the most disk-dominated systems.

automation via outsourced cloud analytics and increased building-grid

increased cyber security threats. BASs were historically developed as closed
environments with limited cyber-security considerations. As a result, BASs in
many buildings are vulnerable to cyber-attacks that may cause adverse
consequences, such as occupant discomfort, excessive energy usage, and
unexpected equipment downtime. Therefore, there is a strong need to advance the

an independent parameter, we have found that the upper bound for the SL

magnitude smaller than the pressure magnitude. By employing $\beta

series of data-driven neural algorithms have been proposed in recent years.
Although GSL models are frequently deployed in privacy-sensitive scenarios, the
user privacy protection of neural GSL models has not drawn much attention. To
comprehensively understand the privacy protection issues, we first introduce
the concept of attackable representation to systematically characterize the
privacy attacks that each model can face. Inspired by the qualitative results,
we propose a novel Privacy-Preserving neural Graph Matching network model,
named PPGM, for graph similarity learning. To prevent reconstruction attacks,
the proposed model does not communicate node-level representations between
devices. Instead, we learn multi-perspective graph representations based on
learnable context vectors. To alleviate the attacks to graph properties, the
obfuscated features that contain information from both graphs are communicated.
In this way, the private properties of each graph can be difficult to infer.
Based on the node-graph matching techniques while calculating the obfuscated
features, PPGM can also be effective in similarity measuring. To quantitatively
evaluate the privacy-preserving ability of neural GSL models, we further
propose an evaluation protocol via training supervised black-box attack models.
Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks show the effectiveness and
strong privacy-protection ability of the proposed model PPGM. The code is

anonymous message signing to work in the UA domain, coping with the constraints
of commercial drones and the tight real-time requirements imposed by the RID

memory-lightweight solution (namely, $CS-A^2RID$) or a computationally-friendly
but memory-hungry approach (namely, $DS-A^2RID$). Besides formally defining the
protocols and formally proving their security in our setting, we also implement

computational load, their energy levels rapidly deplete. To overcome this

high. We employ the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), to address this issue.
Moreover, IPFS protects user data using the industry-standard encryption

the origin of the UFOs and clumpy absorbers due to complicated spectral

resolve parameter degeneracy of the clumpy absorbers and other spectral
components. In this method, the parameters of the absorber in the line of sight
are estimated from the ratio of the partially absorbed spectrum to the
non-absorbed one. We applied this method to the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy
IRAS 13224-3809 observed by XMM-Newton in 2016 for 1.5 Ms, where the source
showed extreme spectral variability and complex absorption features. As a
result, we found that the soft spectral variation is mostly explained by a
change of the covering fraction of the mildly-ionized clumpy absorbers, and
that these absorbers are outflowing with such a high velocity that is
comparable to that of the UFO (~ 0.2-0.3 c). This result implies that the
formation of the clumpy absorbers and the UFO shares the same origin,

  To mitigate the shortcomings of both families of approaches, we propose
Transformer based Linguistically Informed Sanskrit Tokenizer (TransLIST)
consisting of (1) a module that encodes the character input along with
latent-word information, which takes into account the sandhi phenomenon
specific to SWS and is apt to work with partial or no candidate solutions, (2)
a novel soft-masked attention to prioritize potential candidate words and (3) a
novel path ranking algorithm to rectify the corrupted predictions. Experiments
on the benchmark datasets for SWS show that TransLIST outperforms the current
state-of-the-art system by an average 7.2 points absolute gain in terms of
perfect match (PM) metric. The codebase and datasets are publicly available at

we address this shortcoming and prove the security of the BB84 protocol in the

and side channels, such as Trojan-horse attacks, mode dependencies and
classical correlations between the emitted pulses. To do so, we consider a
modified BB84 protocol that exploits the basis mismatched events, which are
often discarded in standard security analyses of this scheme; and employ the
reference technique, a powerful mathematical tool to accommodate source
imperfections in the security analysis of QKD. Moreover, we compare the
achievable secret-key rate of the modified BB84 protocol with that of the
three-state loss-tolerant protocol, and show that the addition of a fourth
state, while redundant in ideal conditions, significantly improves the
estimation of the leaked information in the presence of source imperfections,
resulting in a better performance. This work demonstrates the relevance of the
BB84 protocol in guaranteeing implementation security, taking us a step further

fixed-point sets of the proposed Bellman mappings are utilized to build an
approximate policy-iteration (API) framework for the problem at hand. To
address the ``curse of dimensionality'' in RKHSs, random Fourier features are
utilized to bound the computational complexity of the API. Numerical tests on

invoked in order to explain the origin of this type of planets, one of them
being the high-eccentricity migration. This migration can occur through
different high-eccentricity mechanisms. Our investigation focused on six
different kinds of high-eccentricity mechanisms, namely, direct dispersion,
coplanar, Kozai-Lidov, secular chaos, E1 and E2 mechanisms. We investigated the
efficiency of these mechanisms for the production of HJ candidates in
multi-planet systems initially tightly-packed in the semimajor axis,
considering a large set of numerical simulations of the exact equations of
motion in the context of the N-body problem. In particular, we analyzed the
sensitivity of our results to the initial number of planets, the initial
semimajor axis of the innermost planetary orbit, the initial configuration of
planetary masses, and to the inclusion of general relativity effects. We found
that the E1 mechanism is the most efficient in producing HJ candidates both in
simulations with and without the contribution of general relativity, followed
by the Kozai-Lidov and E2 mechanisms. Our results also revealed that, except
for the initial equal planetary mass configuration, the E1 mechanism was
notably efficient in the other initial planetary mass configurations considered
in this work. Finally, we investigated the production of HJ candidates with
prograde, retrograde, and alternating orbits. According to our statistical
analysis, the Kozai-Lidov mechanism has the highest probability of
significantly exciting the orbital inclinations of the HJ candidates.

  Laplacian-enhanced low-rank tensor kriging approach",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traffic speed is central to characterizing the fluidity of the road network.
Many transportation applications rely on it, such as real-time navigation,
dynamic route planning, and congestion management. Rapid advances in sensing
and communication techniques make traffic speed detection easier than ever.
However, due to sparse deployment of static sensors or low penetration of
mobile sensors, speeds detected are incomplete and far from network-wide use.
In addition, sensors are prone to error or missing data due to various kinds of
reasons, speeds from these sensors can become highly noisy. These drawbacks
call for effective techniques to recover credible estimates from the incomplete
data. In this work, we first identify the issue as a spatiotemporal kriging
problem and propose a Laplacian enhanced low-rank tensor completion (LETC)
framework featuring both lowrankness and multi-dimensional correlations for
large-scale traffic speed kriging under limited observations. To be specific,
three types of speed correlation including temporal continuity, temporal
periodicity, and spatial proximity are carefully chosen and simultaneously
modeled by three different forms of graph Laplacian, named temporal graph
Fourier transform, generalized temporal consistency regularization, and
diffusion graph regularization. We then design an efficient solution algorithm
via several effective numeric techniques to scale up the proposed model to
network-wide kriging. By performing experiments on two public million-level
traffic speed datasets, we finally draw the conclusion and find our proposed
LETC achieves the state-of-the-art kriging performance even under low
observation rates, while at the same time saving more than half computing time
compared with baseline methods. Some insights into spatiotemporal traffic data
modeling and kriging at the network level are provided as well.

this fragile interaction focused on optimizing seed scheduling. However,
real-world results like Google's FuzzBench highlight that these approaches do

Unfortunately, existing mutation scheduling approaches also failed to convince

However, leveraging sparsity may sacrifice expressiveness compared to
full-attention, when important token correlations are multiple hops away. To
combine advantages of both the efficiency of sparse transformer and the
expressiveness of full-attention Transformer, we propose \textit{Diffuser}, a
new state-of-the-art efficient Transformer. Diffuser incorporates all token
interactions within one attention layer while maintaining low computation and
memory costs. The key idea is to expand the receptive field of sparse attention

propose an elaborate captioning process that generates automatic synthetic
descriptions in natural language from given 3D keypoints. This process extracts
low-level pose information -- the posecodes -- using a set of simple but
generic rules on the 3D keypoints. The posecodes are then combined into higher
level textual descriptions using syntactic rules. Automatic annotations
substantially increase the amount of available data, and make it possible to
effectively pretrain deep models for finetuning on human captions. To

  and Control","Under review",,,,"cs.RO cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motion planning and control are crucial components of robotics applications.
Here, spatio-temporal hard constraints like system dynamics and safety
boundaries (e.g., obstacles in automated driving) restrict the robot's motions.
Direct methods from optimal control solve a constrained optimization problem.
However, in many applications finding a proper cost function is inherently
difficult because of the weighting of partially conflicting objectives. On the
other hand, Imitation Learning (IL) methods such as Behavior Cloning (BC)
provide a intuitive framework for learning decision-making from offline
demonstrations and constitute a promising avenue for planning and control in
complex robot applications. Prior work primarily relied on soft-constraint
approaches, which use additional auxiliary loss terms describing the
constraints. However, catastrophic safety-critical failures might occur in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. This work integrates the flexibility of IL
with hard constraint handling in optimal control. Our approach constitutes a
general framework for constraint robotic motion planning and control using
offline IL. Hard constraints are integrated into the learning problem in a
differentiable manner, via explicit completion and gradient-based correction.
Simulated experiments of mobile robot navigation and automated driving provide
evidence for the performance of the proposed method.

the velocity mass matrix is non-diagonal, leading to a dense Schur complement.
Hybridisable discretisations overcome this issue: weakly enforcing continuity
of the velocity field with Lagrange multipliers leads to a sparse system of
equations, which has a similar structure to the pressure Schur complement in
traditional approaches. We describe how the hybridised sparse system can be
preconditioned with a non-nested two-level preconditioner. To solve the coarse
system, we use the multigrid pressure solver that is employed in the
approximate Schur complement method previously proposed by the some of the

and soccer players with groin pain (GP) compared to controls. Since postural
balance asymmetry identified after an initial injury contributes for subsequent
injuries, identification of this asymmetry in soccer players with GP may
highlight the risk of sustaining subsequent noncontact lower extremity

were to (i) examine static and dynamic unipedal postural balance asymmetry in
soccer players with GP compared to healthy ones, and (ii) quantify the risk of
subsequent noncontact lower extremity injuries in these players. Research
question: Do soccer players with GP exhibit higher static and dynamic unipedal
postural balance asymmetry, and higher risk of sustaining subsequent injuries
compared to controls. Methods: In this prospective case control study, 27
soccer players with non-time loss GP (GP group: GPG), and 27 healthy ones
(control group: CG) were enrolled. Static and dynamic unipedal postural balance
asymmetry were evaluated with a force platform using symmetry index (SI), and
Y-balance test (Y-BT), respectively. Additionally, subsequent noncontact lower
extremity musculoskeletal injuries were tracked for 10 months. Results: The GPG
revealed higher (p < 0.01) SI in eyes closed condition, higher (p < 0.001)
side-to-side asymmetry in anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral reach
distances and in composite Y-BT score compared to CG. They showed lower (p <
0.001) composite score for injured limb and higher (p < 0.001) side-to-side
asymmetry in posteromedial reach distance compared to the cutoff values of 89.6
% and 4 cm, respectively. Moreover, GPG exhibited higher odds (OR= 7.48; 95 %
CI = 2.15, 26.00; p < 0.01) of sustaining subsequent injuries compared to CG.
Significance: The Y-BT should be instituted into existing pre-participation
physical examinations to screen for soccer players with non-time loss GP at an
elevated risk of sustaining subsequent injuries. This could help coaches and
clinicians make valid return to play decisions.

development of attention mechanism, encoder-decoder is still the de facto
neural network architecture for state-of-the-art models. While the motivation
for decoding information from some hidden space is straightforward, the strict
separation of the encoding and decoding steps into an encoder and a decoder in
the model architecture is not necessarily a must. Compared to the task of
autoregressive language modeling in the target language, machine translation
simply has an additional source sentence as context. Given the fact that neural
language models nowadays can already handle rather long contexts in the target
language, it is natural to ask whether simply concatenating the source and
target sentences and training a language model to do translation would work. In
this work, we investigate the aforementioned concept for machine translation.
Specifically, we experiment with bilingual translation, translation with
additional target monolingual data, and multilingual translation. In all cases,
this alternative approach performs on par with the baseline encoder-decoder
Transformer, suggesting that an encoder-decoder architecture might be redundant

micro-instabilities (Di Siena et al 2021 Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 125} 025002). By
performing a series of global simulations employing different profiles for the
thermal ions, we show that the fusion gain of this SPARC scenario could be
substantially enhanced up to $\sim 80\%$ by exploiting this fast ion
stabilizing mechanism. A study is also presented to further optimize the
energetic particle profiles, thus possibly leading experimentally to an even
more significant fusion gain.

applications in person authentication, social security, and so on. Existing
gait recognition methods suffer from changes in viewpoint and clothing and
barely consider extracting diverse motion features, a fundamental
characteristic in gaits, from gait sequences. This paper proposes a novel
motion modeling method to extract the discriminative and robust representation.
Specifically, we first extract the motion features from the encoded motion
sequences in the shallow layer. Then we continuously enhance the motion feature
in deep layers. This motion modeling approach is independent of mainstream work
in building network architectures. As a result, one can apply this motion
modeling method to any backbone to improve gait recognition performance. In
this paper, we combine motion modeling with one commonly used backbone~(GaitGL)
as GaitGL-M to illustrate motion modeling. Extensive experimental results on
two commonly-used cross-view gait datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of GaitGL-M over existing state-of-the-art methods.

disease dynamics has been one of the central challenges of mathematical
epidemiology. However, socio-cognitive processes critical for the initiation of
desired behavioral responses during an outbreak have often been neglected or
oversimplified in earlier models. Combining the microscopic Markov chain
approach with the law of total probability, we herein institute a mathematical
model describing the dynamic interplay between stage-based progression of
awareness diffusion and endemic disease transmission in multiplex networks. We
analytically derived the epidemic thresholds for both discrete-time and
continuous-time versions of our model, and we numerically demonstrated the
accuracy of our analytic arguments in capturing the time course and the
steady-state of the coupled disease-awareness dynamics. We found that our model
is exact for arbitrary unclustered multiplex networks, outperforming a widely
adopted probability-tree-based method, both in the prediction of the
time-evolution of a contagion and in the final epidemic size. Our findings show
that informing the unaware individuals about the circulating disease will not
be sufficient for the prevention of an outbreak unless the distributed
information triggers strong awareness of infection risks with adequate
protective measures, and that the immunity of highly-aware individuals can
elevate the epidemic threshold, but only if the rate of transition from weak to
strong awareness is sufficiently high. Our study thus reveals that awareness
diffusion and other behavioral parameters can nontrivially interact when
producing their effects on epidemiological dynamics of an infectious disease,
suggesting that future public health measures should not ignore this complex
behavioral interplay and its influence on contagion transmission in
multilayered networked systems.

the issue as the sharpness of separation decreases and the pathologist's
reasoning is even more guided by spatial context. However, the identification

therapies. Due to the high resolution of whole slide images, existing semantic
segmentation methods, restricted to isolated image sections, are incapable of

comprehension, we propose a patch neighbour attention mechanism to query the
neighbouring tissue context from a patch embedding memory bank and infuse
context embeddings into bottleneck hidden feature maps. Our memory attention
framework (MAF) mimics a pathologist's annotation procedure -- zooming out and
considering surrounding tissue context. The framework can be integrated into
any encoder-decoder segmentation method. We evaluate the MAF on a public breast
cancer and an internal kidney cancer data set using famous segmentation models
(U-Net, DeeplabV3) and demonstrate the superiority over other
context-integrating algorithms -- achieving a substantial improvement of up to
$17\%$ on Dice score. The code is publicly available at:

operation of some urban roads and underground facilities. When identifying
subsurface anomalies by GPR in an area, the obtained data could be unbalanced,
and the numbers and types of possible underground anomalies could not be
acknowledged in advance. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to improve
the subsurface anomaly detection from GPR B-scan images. A normal (i.e. without
subsurface objects) GPR image section is firstly collected in the detected
area. Concerning that the GPR image is essentially the representation of
electromagnetic (EM) wave and propagation time, and to preserve both the
subsurface background and objects' details, the normal GPR image is segmented
and then fused with simulated GPR images that contain different kinds of
objects to generate the synthetic data for the detection area based on the
wavelet decompositions. Pre-trained CNNs could then be fine-tuned with the
synthetic data, and utilized to extract features of segmented GPR images
subsequently obtained in the detection area. The extracted features could be
classified by the one-class learning algorithm in the feature space without
pre-set anomaly types or numbers. The conducted experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning the pre-trained CNN with the proposed synthetic data could
effectively improve the feature extraction of the network for the objects in
the detection area. Besides, the proposed method requires only a section of
normal data that could be easily obtained in the detection area, and could also
meet the timeliness requirements in practical applications.

Existing works on CBwK are restricted to the linear function class since they
use UCB-type algorithms, which heavily rely on the linear form and thus are
difficult to extend to general function classes. Motivated by online regression
oracles that have been successfully applied to contextual bandits, we propose
the first universal and optimal algorithmic framework for CBwK by reducing it

(allocated CPUs, software block cache and FPGA based accelerator). First, we
propose a methodology to measure power/energy consumption of the two resulting
compute platforms (CPU-only and CPU+FPGA). Then, we use our methodology to
evaluate energy efficiency of a diverse set of validator peer configurations,
and present many useful insights. With careful selection of software
optimizations and FPGA accelerator configuration, we improved energy efficiency
of validator peer by 10$\times$ compared to vanilla validator peer (i.e.,
energy-aware provisioning of validator peer can deliver 10$\times$ more
throughput while consuming the same amount of energy). In absolute terms, this
means 23,000 tx/s with power consumption of 118W from a validator peer using
software block cache running on a 4-core server with AMD/Xilinx Alveo U250 FPGA

composition treatment can lead to changes in the neutrino heating in the
vicinity of the shock, by modifying the amount of nucleons and thus the
$\mathrm{\nu}$-opacity of the region. This reduces the ram pressure outside the
shock and allows an easier expansion. The energy released by the nuclear
reactions during collapse also slows down the accretion, and aids the shock
expansion. In addition, nuclear energy generation in the post-shocked matter
produces more energetic explosions, up to $20\,\%$. Nucleosynthesis is affected
due to the different dynamic evolution of the explosion. Our results indicate
that the energy generation from nuclear reactions helps to sustain late
outflows from the vicinity of the proto-neutron star (PNS), synthesizing more
neutron-rich species. Furthermore, we show that there are systematic
discrepancies between the ejecta calculated with in-situ and ex-situ reaction
networks. The mass fractions of some Ca, Ti, Cr, and Fe isotopes are
consistently under-produced in post-processing calculations, leading to
different nucleosynthesis paths. Therefore, large in-situ nuclear reaction
networks are needed for a more accurate nucleosynthesis.

is a novelty in this kind of models and is computed by considering a

model for incompressible two-phase flows. We prove that this SPH method
inherits mass and momentum conservation and energy dissipation properties at
the fully discrete level. With the projection procedure to decouple the
momentum and continuity equations, the numerical scheme meets the
divergence-free condition. Some numerical experiments are carried out to show
the performance of the proposed energy-stable SPH method for solving the
two-phase NSCH model. The inheritance of mass and momentum conservation and the
energy dissipation properties are verified numerically.

current algebraic combinatorics is to find pattern sets $\Pi$ such that the
corresponding quasi-symmetric function is symmetric for all $n$. Recently,
Bloom and Sagan proved that for any $k \ge 4$, the size of such $\Pi$ must be

asked for a general lower bound.
  We prove that the minimal size of such $\Pi$ is exactly $k - 1$. The proof
applies a new generalization of a theorem of Bose from extremal combinatorics.
This generalization is proved using the multilinear polynomial approach of
Alon, Babai and Suzuki to the extension by Ray-Chaudhuri and Wilson to Bose's

double ratio $S_3$ is almost independent of canonical effects, which is in
contrast to coalescence. Thus, both the beam energy dependence and centrality

do so the currently available data is not yet sufficient. Elliptic flow is

spiral galaxy NGC 6946. We analyze the distributions of the oxygen abundance,
star formation rate surface density, extinction, ionization, diffuse ionized
gas, and the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich classification throughout the galaxy.
By analyzing in detail the optical properties of the 121 previously identify HI
holes in NGC 6946, we find that the SNRs are concentrated at the rims of the HI
holes. Furthermore, our IFU data shows that the star formation rate and
extinction are enhanced at the rims of the holes. To a lesser degree, the
oxygen abundance and ionization parameter show hints of enhancement on the rims
of the holes.
  Altogether, this provides evidence of induced star formation taking place at
the rims of the holes, whose origin can be explained by the expansion of
superbubbles created by multiple supernova explosions in large stellar clusters
dozens of Myr ago.

Recent years have witnessed the success of deep clustering coupled with graph
neural networks (GNNs). However, existing methods focus on clustering among
nodes given a single graph, while exploring clustering on multiple graphs is
still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a general graph-level
clustering framework named Graph-Level Contrastive Clustering (GLCC) given
multiple graphs. Specifically, GLCC first constructs an adaptive affinity graph
to explore instance- and cluster-level contrastive learning (CL).
Instance-level CL leverages graph Laplacian based contrastive loss to learn
clustering-friendly representations while cluster-level CL captures
discriminative cluster representations incorporating neighbor information of
each sample. Moreover, we utilize neighbor-aware pseudo-labels to reward the
optimization of representation learning. The two steps can be alternatively
trained to collaborate and benefit each other. Experiments on a range of
well-known datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed GLCC over
competitive baselines.

translate User-Generated Text (UGT) such as reviews, tweets, and social media

in some low-resource languages and sometimes make critical translation errors
that completely flip the sentiment polarity of the target word or phrase and
hence delivers a wrong affect message. This is particularly noticeable in texts
that do not follow common lexico-grammatical standards such as the dialectical

exploits both monolingual and parallel data for training an NMT system
initialised by a cross-lingual language model trained with supervised and

the whole source sentence and employs either fixed or adaptive policy to
generate the target sentence. Compared to the fixed policy, the adaptive policy
achieves better latency-quality tradeoffs by adopting a flexible translation
policy. If the policy can evaluate rationality before taking action, the
probability of incorrect actions will also decrease. However, previous methods
lack evaluation of actions before taking them. In this paper, we propose a
method of performing the adaptive policy via integrating post-evaluation into
the fixed policy. Specifically, whenever a candidate token is generated, our
model will evaluate the rationality of the next action by measuring the change
in the source content. Our model will then take different actions based on the
evaluation results. Experiments on three translation tasks show that our method
can exceed strong baselines under all latency.

that it compares well with numerical calculations. Our results provide a

application of SBI in neuroscience involves estimating the parameters governing
the response dynamics of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) models from electrophysiological
measurements, by inferring a posterior over the parameters that is consistent
with a set of observations. To this end, many SBI methods employ a set of
summary statistics or scientifically interpretable features to estimate a
surrogate likelihood or posterior. However, currently, there is no way to
identify how much each summary statistic or feature contributes to reducing
posterior uncertainty. To address this challenge, one could simply compare the
posteriors with and without a given feature included in the inference process.
However, for large or nested feature sets, this would necessitate repeatedly
estimating the posterior, which is computationally expensive or even
prohibitive. Here, we provide a more efficient approach based on the SBI method
neural likelihood estimation (NLE): We show that one can marginalize the
trained surrogate likelihood post-hoc before inferring the posterior to assess
the contribution of a feature. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method by
identifying the most important features for inferring parameters of an example
HH neuron model. Beyond neuroscience, our method is generally applicable to SBI

O atom in molecules cannot form a chalcogen bond, and ii) if formed, this bond
is very weak. We have shown in this study that these views are not necessarily
true since the attractive energy between the oxygen atom of some molecules and
several electron rich anionic bases examined in a series of 34 ion-molecule
complexes varied from the weak (ca -2.30 kcal/mol) to the ultrastrong (-90.10
kcal/mol). The [MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ] binding energies for several of these
complexes were found to be comparable to or significantly larger than that of
the well-known hydrogen bond complex [FH...F]- (roughly -40 kcal/mol). The
nature of the intermolecular interactions was examined using the quantum theory
of atoms in molecules, second order natural bond orbital and symmetric adaptive
perturbation theory energy decomposition analyses. It was found that many of
these interactions comprise mixed bonding character (ionic and covalent),
especially manifest in the moderate to strongly bound complexes. All these can
be explained by a bonding to an anti-bonding orbital type donor acceptor charge
transfer delocalization. This study, therefore, demonstrates that the
covalently bound oxygen atom in molecules can have a significant ability to act
as an unusually strong chalcogen bond donor.

  Generative Adversarial Networks",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn cs.CV cs.LG nlin.CD physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Three methods are used to reconstruct two-dimensional instantaneous velocity
fields in a turbulent flow under rotation. The first two methods both use the
linear proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), which are Gappy POD (GPOD) and
Extended POD (EPOD), while the third one reconstructs the flow using a fully
non-linear Convolutional Neural Network embedded in a Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN). First, we show that there is always an optimal number of modes
regarding a specific gap for the GPOD with dimension reduction. Moreover,
adopting a Lasso regularizer for GPOD provides comparable reconstruction
results. In order to systematically compare the applicability of the three
tools, we consider a square gap at changing the size. Results show that
compared with POD-based methods, GAN reconstruction not only has a smaller
$L_2$ error, but also better turbulent statistics of both the velocity module
and the velocity module gradient. This can be attributed to the ability of
nonlinearity expression of the network and the presence of adversarial loss
during the GAN training. We also investigate effects of the adversarial ratio,
which controls the compromising between the $L_2$ error and the statistical
properties. Finally, we assess the reconstruction on random gappiness. All
methods perform well for small- and medium-size gaps, while GAN works better
when the gappiness is large.

concern from both the research community and the public that these systems are
not only reproducing but amplifying harmful social biases. The phenomenon of
bias amplification, which is the focus of this work, refers to models
amplifying inherent training set biases at test time. Existing metrics measure
bias amplification with respect to single annotated attributes (e.g.,
$\texttt{computer}$). However, several visual datasets consist of images with
multiple attribute annotations. We show models can learn to exploit
correlations with respect to multiple attributes (e.g., {$\texttt{computer}$,
$\texttt{keyboard}$}), which are not accounted for by current metrics. In
addition, we show current metrics can give the erroneous impression that
minimal or no bias amplification has occurred as they involve aggregating over
positive and negative values. Further, these metrics lack a clear desired
value, making them difficult to interpret. To address these shortcomings, we
propose a new metric: Multi-Attribute Bias Amplification. We validate our
proposed metric through an analysis of gender bias amplification on the COCO
and imSitu datasets. Finally, we benchmark bias mitigation methods using our
proposed metric, suggesting possible avenues for future bias mitigation

  Monte Carlo",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose Barrier Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (BHMC), a version
of the HMC algorithm which aims at sampling from a Gibbs distribution $\pi$ on
a manifold $\mathrm{M}$, endowed with a Hessian metric $\mathfrak{g}$ derived
from a self-concordant barrier. Our method relies on Hamiltonian dynamics which
comprises $\mathfrak{g}$. Therefore, it incorporates the constraints defining
$\mathrm{M}$ and is able to exploit its underlying geometry. However, the
corresponding Hamiltonian dynamics is defined via non separable Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) in contrast to the Euclidean case. It implies
unavoidable bias in existing generalization of HMC to Riemannian manifolds. In
this paper, we propose a new filter step, called ""involution checking step"", to
address this problem. This step is implemented in two versions of BHMC, coined
continuous BHMC (c-BHMC) and numerical BHMC (n-BHMC) respectively. Our main
results establish that these two new algorithms generate reversible Markov
chains with respect to $\pi$ and do not suffer from any bias in comparison to
previous implementations. Our conclusions are supported by numerical
experiments where we consider target distributions defined on polytopes.

emission toward the FIR luminous quasar SDSS J231038.88+185519.7 at $z =
6.0031$. The [CII] brightness follows a flat distribution with a Sersic index
of 0.59. The CO(9-8) line and the dust continuum can be fit with an unresolved
nuclear component and an extended Sersic component with a Sersic index of ~1.
The dust temperature drops with distance from the center. The effective radius
of the dust continuum is smaller than that of the line emission and the dust
mass surface density, but is consistent with that of the star formation rate
surface density. The OH$^{+}$\,($1_{1}$--$0_{1}$) line shows a P-Cygni profile

both rotation dominated and trace identical disk geometries and gas motions. We
decompose the circular rotation curve measured from the kinematic model fit to
the [CII] line into four matter components (black hole, stars, gas, and dark
matter). The quasar-starburst system is dominated by baryonic matter inside the
central few kiloparsecs. We constrain the black hole mass to be
$2.97^{+0.51}_{-0.77}\times 10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$; this is the first time that the
dynamical mass of a black hole has been measured at $z\sim6$. A massive stellar
component (on the order of $10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$) may have already existed when
the Universe was only ~0.93 Gyr old. The relations between the black hole mass
and the baryonic mass of this quasar indicate that the central supermassive
black hole may have formed before its host galaxy. [Abridged version. Please

non-Gaussian fixed points discovered in four spacetime dimensions. A notable
exception is a non-Gaussian fixed point at finite Pauli spin-field coupling but
vanishing gauge coupling, which also remains stable down to $d=3$ dimensions
and for small flavor numbers. This includes also the range of degrees of
freedom used in effective theories of layered condensed-matter systems. As an
application, we construct renormalization group trajectories that emanate from
the non-Gaussian fixed point and approach a long-range regime in the
conventional QED${}_3$ universality class that is governed by the interacting

backed by any asset (equiv. without collateral). They stand to revolutionize
the way a sovereign fiat operates. As implemented, these coins are poorly
stabilized in most cases, easily deviating from the price target or even
falling into a catastrophic collapse (a.k.a. Death spiral), and are as a result
dismissed as a Ponzi scheme. However, is this the whole picture? In this paper,
we try to reveal the truth and clarify such a deceptive concept. We find that
Ponzi is basically a financial protocol that pays existing investors with funds
collected from new ones. Running a Ponzi, however, does not necessarily imply
that any participant is in any sense losing out, as long as the game can be
perpetually rolled over. Economists call such realization as a \textit{rational
Ponzi game}. We thereby propose a rational model in the context of AS and draw
its holding conditions. We apply the model to examine: \textit{whether or not
the algorithmic stablecoin is a rational Ponzi game.} Accordingly, we discuss
two types of algorithmic stablecoins (\text{Rebase} \& \text{Seigniorage

projects (\text{Ampleforth} \& \text{TerraUSD}, respectively) to demonstrate

BLIP with dynamic temporal scaling. Besides the model-wise adaptation, we also
propose a non-parametric pooling mechanism to adaptively reweight the

motion/parallax space. The revised Gaia EDR3 distance is 925$\pm$73 pc,

distinct subclusters in the region. These subclusters are consistent in
distance but display differences in proper motion. This, with their age
differences, hints towards a complex and varied star formation history. Gaia
data also unveil the intermediate-mass objects that tend to evade spectroscopic

estimate an average age of $\sim$4 Myr, confirming previous age estimates. With
the new members added to our study, we estimate a disk fraction of 28\%, lower

detector represented by the Einstein Telescope (ET); ii) three standard siren
mock catalogs based on the merger of massive black hole binaries that are

to test deviations from general relativity at $<3\%$ accuracy in the redshift

for real-time object detection, accuracy, and speed. This paper investigates
the YOLOv5 model to identify cattle in the yards. The current solution to
cattle identification includes radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. The
problem occurs when the RFID tag is lost or damaged. A biometric solution
identifies the cattle and helps to assign the lost or damaged tag or replace
the RFID-based system. Muzzle patterns in cattle are unique biometric solutions
like a fingerprint in humans. This paper aims to present our recent research in
utilizing five popular object detection models, looking at the architecture of
YOLOv5, investigating the performance of eight backbones with the YOLOv5 model,
and the influence of mosaic augmentation in YOLOv5 by experimental results on
the available cattle muzzle images. Finally, we concluded with the excellent
potential of using YOLOv5 in automatic cattle identification. Our experiments
show YOLOv5 with transformer performed best with mean Average Precision (mAP)
0.5 (the average of AP when the IoU is greater than 50%) of 0.995, and mAP
0.5:0.95 (the average of AP from 50% to 95% IoU with an interval of 5%) of
0.9366. In addition, our experiments show the increase in accuracy of the model
by using mosaic augmentation in all backbones used in our experiments.
Moreover, we can also detect cattle with partial muzzle images.

the extremely long tail distribution of the concepts, it is of utmost
importance to develop models that are capable to generalize to scarce or unseen

hierarchical structure. In this paper we introduce a simple and effective
learning strategy that leverages such information to enhance the
generalizability of both discriminative and generative models. The evaluation

multivariate statistics. While these models can be both linked to structures
exhibited by covariance and precision matrices, they are generally not jointly
leveraged within graph learning processes. This paper therefore addresses this
issue by proposing a flexible algorithmic framework for graph learning under
low-rank structural constraints on the covariance matrix. The problem is
expressed as penalized maximum likelihood estimation of an elliptical
distribution (a generalization of Gaussian graphical models to possibly
heavy-tailed distributions), where the covariance matrix is optionally
constrained to be structured as low-rank plus diagonal (low-rank factor model).
The resolution of this class of problems is then tackled with Riemannian
optimization, where we leverage geometries of positive definite matrices and
positive semi-definite matrices of fixed rank that are well suited to
elliptical models. Numerical experiments on real-world data sets illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

multi-item, multi-supplier double order allocations with dual-sourcing and

  Selection","18 pages; submitted to Applied Intelligence",,,,"cs.IT cs.LG cs.NE math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Feature selection plays a vital role in promoting the classifier's
performance. However, current methods ineffectively distinguish the complex
interaction in the selected features. To further remove these hidden negative
interactions, we propose a GA-like dynamic probability (GADP) method with
mutual information which has a two-layer structure. The first layer applies the
mutual information method to obtain a primary feature subset. The GA-like
dynamic probability algorithm, as the second layer, mines more supportive
features based on the former candidate features. Essentially, the GA-like
method is one of the population-based algorithms so its work mechanism is
similar to the GA. Different from the popular works which frequently focus on
improving GA's operators for enhancing the search ability and lowering the
converge time, we boldly abandon GA's operators and employ the dynamic
probability that relies on the performance of each chromosome to determine
feature selection in the new generation. The dynamic probability mechanism
significantly reduces the parameter number in GA that making it easy to use. As
each gene's probability is independent, the chromosome variety in GADP is more
notable than in traditional GA, which ensures GADP has a wider search space and
selects relevant features more effectively and accurately. To verify our
method's superiority, we evaluate our method under multiple conditions on 15
datasets. The results demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed method.
Generally, it has the best accuracy. Further, we also compare the proposed
model to the popular heuristic methods like POS, FPA, and WOA. Our model still
owns advantages over them.

In this paper, we extend the definition of the asymmetry from the partonic

the semi-inclusive electron position annihilation process. Semi-inclusive
implies that a back-to-back jet is also measured in addition to the hadron
pair. Due to the limitation of the factorization theorem, we calculate this
process up to leading order twist-4 level by applying the collinear expansion
formalism. After obtaining the differential cross section, we calculate the
forward-backward asymmetries and show them in terms of the corresponding
di-hadron fragmentation functions. Di-hadron fragmentation functions are
introduced to describe the hadron pair productions in the fragmentation
process. With available parameterization of the functions, we present a
numerical estimation of the forward-backward asymmetry. On the flip side,
measurements of the forward-backward asymmetry would give strict restrictions
of parameterizations of the di-hadron fragmentation functions. We also present
a numerical estimation of the twist-4 di-hadron fragmentation functions in

  Approach: Human observer studies used two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC)
trials with a small signal known exactly task but with varying backgrounds for
fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images reconstructed from undersampled
multi-coil data. We used a 3.48 undersampling factor with TV and a wavelet

  Results: We observed a trend that the human observer detection performance
remained fairly constant for a broad range of values in the regularization
parameter before decreasing at large values. A similar result was found for the
normalized ensemble root mean squared error. Without changing the internal
noise, the model observer tracked the performance of the human observers as the
regularization was increased but overestimated the PC for large amounts of
regularization for TV and wavelet sparsity, as well as the combination of both
parameters.
  Conclusions: For the task we studied, the S-DOG observer was able to
reasonably predict human performance with both TV and wavelet sparsity

  Fading Channels with Finite Blocklength","88 pages, 7 figures. Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Information
  Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper considers the massive random access problem in MIMO quasi-static
Rayleigh fading channels. Specifically, we derive achievability and converse
bounds on the minimum energy-per-bit required for each active user to transmit
$J$ bits with blocklength $n$ and power $P$ under a per-user probability of
error (PUPE) constraint, in the cases with and without \emph{a priori} channel
state information at the receiver (CSIR and no-CSI). In the case of no-CSI, we
consider both the settings with and without knowing the number $K_a$ of active
users. The achievability bounds rely on the design of the ``good region''.
Numerical evaluation shows the gap between achievability and converse bounds is
less than $2.5$ dB in the CSIR case and less than $4$ dB in the no-CSI case in
most considered regimes. When the distribution of $K_a$ is known, the
performance gap between the cases with and without knowing the value of $K_a$
is small. For example, in the setup with blocklength $n=1000$, payload $J=100$,
error requirement $\epsilon=0.001$, and $L=128$ receive antennas, compared to
the case with known $K_a$, the extra required energy-per-bit when $K_a$ is
unknown and distributed as $K_a\sim\text{Binom}(K,0.4)$ is less than $0.3$ dB
on the converse side and $1.1$ dB on the achievability side. The spectral
efficiency grows approximately linearly with $L$ in the CSIR case, whereas the
growth rate decreases with no-CSI. Moreover, we study the performance of a
pilot-assisted scheme, which is suboptimal especially when $K_a$ is large.
Building on non-asymptotic results, when all users are active and
$J=\Theta(1)$, we obtain scaling laws as follows: when $L=\Theta
\left(n^2\right)$ and $P=\Theta\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right)$, one can reliably
serve $K=\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ users with no-CSI; under mild conditions with CSIR,
the PUPE requirement is satisfied if and only if $\frac{nL\ln
KP}{K}=\Omega\left(1\right)$.

we provide a possible way to make use of this collection of models in data
assimilation by generalizing the idea of model hierarchies into model forests
-- collections of high fidelity and low fidelity models organized in a groping
of model trees such as to capture various relationships between different
models. We generalize the multifidelity ensemble Kalman filter that previously
operated on model hierarchies into the model forest ensemble Kalman filter
through a generalized theory of linear control variates. This new filter allows
for much more freedom when treading the line between accuracy and speed.
Numerical experiments with a high fidelity quasi-geostrophic model and two of
its low fidelity reduced order models validate the accuracy of our approach.

Outside of staged environments, accurate localization of suture needles is a
critical foundation for automating various suture needle manipulation tasks in
the real world. When localizing a needle held by a gripper, previous work
usually tracks them separately without considering their relationship. Because
of the significant errors that can arise in the stereo-triangulation of objects
and instruments, their reconstructions may often not be consistent. This can
lead to unrealistic tool-needle grasp reconstructions that are infeasible.
Instead, an obvious strategy to improve localization would be to leverage
constraints that arise from contact, thereby constraining reconstructions of
objects and instruments into a jointly feasible space. In this work, we
consider feasible grasping constraints when tracking the 6D pose of an in-hand
suture needle. We propose a reparameterization trick to define a new state
space for describing a needle pose, where grasp constraints can be easily
defined and satisfied. Our proposed state space and feasible grasping
constraints are then incorporated into Bayesian filters for real-time needle
localization. In the experiments, we show that our constrained methods
outperform previous unconstrained/constrained tracking approaches and
demonstrate the importance of incorporating feasible grasping constraints into
automating suture needle manipulation tasks.

This predicts the overall SED fairly well for

$L/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$, but at higher masses the outer disc spectra in the model
are far too cool to match the data. We create optical-UV composites from the

the first time that this cannot be matched by standard disc models with high
black hole spin. These apparently fit, but are not self-consistent as they do
not include the General Relativistic effects for the emission to reach the
observer. At high spin, increased gravitational redshift compensates for almost
all of the higher temperature emission from the smaller inner disc radii. The
data do not match the predictions made by any current accretion flow model.
Either the disc is completely covered by a warm Comptonisation layer whose
properties change systematically with $L/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$, or the accretion
flow structure is fundamentally different to that of the standard disc models.

lightweight LiDAR-Iris descriptor for place recognition and does not require
full connectivity among teams. DCL-SLAM includes three main parts: a
replaceable single-robot front-end that produces LiDAR odometry results; a
distributed loop closure module that detects inter-robot loop closures with
keyframes; and a distributed back-end module that adapts distributed pose graph
optimizer combined with a pairwise consistent measurement set maximization
algorithm to reject spurious inter-robot loop closures. We integrate our
proposed framework with diverse open-source LiDAR odometry methods to show its
versatility. The proposed system is extensively evaluated on benchmarking

ensure the correctness of the information, allowing any two willing parties to
transact directly with each other. Smart contracts are pieces of code that
reside inside the blockchains and can be triggered to execute any transaction
when specifically predefined conditions are satisfied. Being commonly used for
commercial transactions in blockchain makes the security of smart contracts
particularly important. Over the last few years, we have seen a great deal of
academic and practical interest in detecting and repairing the vulnerabilities
in smart contracts developed for the Ethereum blockchain. In this paper, we
conduct an empirical study on historical bug fixing versions of 46 real-world
smart contracts projects from Github, providing a multi-faceted discussion. In
this paper, we mainly explore the following four questions: File Type and
Amount, Fix Complexity, Bug distribution, and Fix Patches. By analyzing the
file type, amount, and fix complexity, we find that about 80% of the
bug-related commits modified no more than one solidity source file to fix bugs.
Up to 80% of bugs in solidity source files can be fixed by less than three fix
actions. Modification is the mostly used fix action, which involves three lines
of code on average. By using the analysis tool Mythril to detect the
vulnerabilities, we find that nearly 20% of the solidity files in our dataset
had or have had vulnerabilities. We finally find that the developers may not
put much attention to fixing vulnerabilities reported by Mythril completely or
avoid introducing them again. Because vulnerabilities that have a high repair
percentage usually have a high rate to be introduced again.

the problem of constrained monotone submodular maximization with noisy oracles

an algorithm achieving a near-optimal

noisy value oracle, which improves the exponential query complexity of [Singer

design a novel local search framework that can handle the effect of noise and

the basic nature of this problem, it was shown only recently that UCQs can be
solved within these time bounds if they admit free-connex union extensions,
even if all individual CQs in the union are intractable with respect to the
same complexity measure. Our goal is to understand whether there exist
additional tractable UCQs, not covered by the currently known algorithms. As a
first step, we show that some previously unclassified UCQs are hard using the
classic 3SUM hypothesis, via a known reduction from 3SUM to triangle listing in
graphs. As a second step, we identify a question about a variant of this graph
task which is unavoidable if we want to classify all self-join free UCQs: is it
possible to decide the existence of a triangle in a vertex-unbalanced
tripartite graph in linear time? We prove that this task is equivalent in
hardness to some family of UCQs. Finally, we show a dichotomy for unions of two
self-join-free CQs if we assume the answer to this question is negative. Our
conclusion is that, to reason about a class of enumeration problems defined by
UCQs, it is enough to study the single decision problem of detecting triangles
in unbalanced graphs. Without a breakthrough for triangle detection, we have no
hope to find an efficient algorithm for additional unions of two self-join free

computation costs. It is thus of great interest to train a narrower network.
However, training narrow neural nets remains a challenging task. We ask two
theoretical questions: Can narrow networks have as strong expressivity as wide
ones? If so, does the loss function exhibit a benign optimization landscape? In
this work, we provide partially affirmative answers to both questions for
1-hidden-layer networks with fewer than $n$ (sample size) neurons when the
activation is smooth. First, we prove that as long as the width $m \geq 2n/d$
(where $d$ is the input dimension), its expressivity is strong, i.e., there
exists at least one global minimizer with zero training loss. Second, we
identify a nice local region with no local-min or saddle points. Nevertheless,
it is not clear whether gradient descent can stay in this nice region. Third,
we consider a constrained optimization formulation where the feasible region is
the nice local region, and prove that every KKT point is a nearly global
minimizer. It is expected that projected gradient methods converge to KKT
points under mild technical conditions, but we leave the rigorous convergence
analysis to future work. Thorough numerical results show that projected
gradient methods on this constrained formulation significantly outperform SGD

features, it can enhance machine learning algorithm's performance and
accelerate computing speed. In various methods, mutual information has
attracted increasingly more attention as it's an effective criterion to measure
variable correlation. However, current works mainly focus on maximizing the
feature relevancy with class label and minimizing the feature redundancy within
selected features, we reckon that pursuing feature redundancy minimization is
reasonable but not necessary because part of so-called redundant features also
carries some useful information to promote performance. In terms of mutual
information calculation, it may distort the true relationship between two
variables without proper neighborhood partition. Traditional methods usually
split the continuous variables into several intervals even ignore such
influence. We theoretically prove how variable fluctuation negatively
influences mutual information calculation. To remove the referred obstacles,
for feature selection method, we propose a full conditional mutual information
maximization method (FCMIM) which only considers the feature relevancy in two
aspects. For obtaining a better partition effect and eliminating the negative
influence of attribute fluctuation, we put up an adaptive neighborhood
partition algorithm (ANP) with the feedback of mutual information maximization
algorithm, the backpropagation process helps search for a proper neighborhood
partition parameter. We compare our method with several mutual information
methods on 17 benchmark datasets. Results of FCMIM are better than other
methods based on different classifiers. Results show that ANP indeed promotes

(SCF) calculations requires a generalised two-component framework, which
permits the single-determinant wave function to completely break spin symmetry.
The individual components of the molecular g-tensor are commonly obtained from
separate SCF solutions that align the magnetic moment along one of the three
principal tensor axes. However, this strategy raises the question if energy
differences between solutions are relevant, or how convergence is achieved if
the principal axis system is not determined by molecular symmetry. The present
work resolves these issues by a simple two-step procedure akin to the generator
coordinate method (GCM). First, a few generalised Hartree Fock (GHF) solutions
are converged, applying, where needed, a constraint to the orientation of the
magnetic-moment or spin vector. Then, superpositions of GHF determinants are
formed through non-orthogonal configuration interaction. This procedure yields
a Kramers doublet for the calculation of the complete g-tensor. Alternatively,
for systems with weak spin-orbit effects, diagonalisation in a basis spanned by
spin rotations of a single GHF determinant affords qualitatively correct
g-tensors by eliminating errors related to spin contamination. For small
first-row molecules, these approaches are evaluated against experimental data
and full configuration interaction results. It is further demonstrated for two
systems (a fictitious tetrahedral CH4+ species, and a CuF4(2-) complex) that a
GCM strategy, in contrast to alternative mean-field methods, can correctly
describe the spin-orbit splitting of orbitally-degenerate ground states, which
causes large g-shifts and may lead to negative g-values.

tackle nonlinearly constrained optimization problems that admit equality and
inequality constraints. An important feature of COBYQA is that it always
respects bound constraints, if any, which is motivated by applications where
the objective function is undefined when bounds are violated. We expose

  to magnetic induction measurements","18 pages, 16 figures, submitted to Planetary Science Journal",,,,"astro-ph.EP physics.space-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Some icy moons and small bodies in the solar system are believed to host
subsurface liquid water oceans. The interaction of these saline, electrically
conductive oceans with time-varying external magnetic fields generates induced
magnetic fields. Magnetometry observations of these induced fields in turn
enable the detection and characterization of these oceans. We present a
framework for characterizing the interiors of icy moons using multi-frequency
induction and Bayesian inference applied to magnetometry measurements
anticipated from the upcoming Europa Clipper mission. Using simulated data from
the Europa Clipper Magnetometer (ECM), our approach can accurately retrieve a
wide range of plausible internal structures for Europa. In particular, the
ocean conductivity is recovered to within ${\pm}50\%$ for all internal
structure scenarios considered and the ocean thickness can be retrieved to
within ${\pm}25~\mathrm{km}$ for five out of seven scenarios. Characterization
of the ice shell thickness to ${\pm}50\%$ is possible for six of seven
scenarios. Our recovery of the ice shell thickness is highly contingent on
accurate modeling of magnetic fields arising from the interaction of Europa
with the ambient magnetospheric plasma, while the ocean thickness is more
modestly affected and the ocean conductivity retrieval is largely unchanged.
Furthermore, we find that the addition of a priori constraints (e.g., static
gravity measurements) can yield improved ocean characterization compared to
magnetometry alone, suggesting that multi-instrument techniques can play a key
role in revealing the interiors of Europa and other ocean worlds.

vulnerability to adversarial attacks and understanding deep learning's
generalization capabilities. Towards the first issue, many defense strategies
have been developed, with the most common being Adversarial Training (AT).
Towards the second challenge, one of the dominant theories that has emerged is
the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) -- a characterization of neural network
behavior in the infinite-width limit. In this limit, the kernel is frozen, and
the underlying feature map is fixed. In finite widths, however, there is
evidence that feature learning happens at the earlier stages of the training
(kernel learning) before a second phase where the kernel remains fixed (lazy
training). While prior work has aimed at studying adversarial vulnerability
through the lens of the frozen infinite-width NTK, there is no work that
studies the adversarial robustness of the empirical/finite NTK during training.
In this work, we perform an empirical study of the evolution of the empirical
NTK under standard and adversarial training, aiming to disambiguate the effect
of adversarial training on kernel learning and lazy training. We find under
adversarial training, the empirical NTK rapidly converges to a different kernel
(and feature map) than standard training. This new kernel provides adversarial
robustness, even when non-robust training is performed on top of it.
Furthermore, we find that adversarial training on top of a fixed kernel can
yield a classifier with $76.1\%$ robust accuracy under PGD attacks with
$\varepsilon = 4/255$ on CIFAR-10.

dimensional Euclidean Schwarzschild black hole. We argue that in the limit
where the Hawking temperature of the black hole, $T$, approaches the Hagedorn
temperature, $T_H$, it can be described in terms of a generalized version of
the Horowitz-Polchinski effective theory. For $d\geq6$, where the
Horowitz-Polchinski EFT [1,2] does not have suitable solutions, the modified
effective Lagrangian allows one to study the black hole CFT in an expansion in
powers of $d-6$ and $T_H-T$. At $T=T_H$, the sigma model is non-trivial for all
$d>6$. It exhibits an enhanced $SU(2)$ symmetry, and is described by a
non-abelian Thirring model with a radially dependent coupling. The resulting
picture connects naturally to the results of [3-5], that relate Schwarzschild
black holes in flat spacetime at large $d$ to the two dimensional black hole.
We also discuss an analogous open string system, in which the black hole is
replaced by a system of two separated D-branes connected by a throat. In this
system, the asymptotic separation of the branes plays the role of the inverse
temperature. At the critical separation, the system is described by a

zero and the parameter one to a bounded set when the regressor is s-PE, 2)

adjusted using a separate first-order scalar differential equation), 3)
alertness to change of the uncertainty parameters values, and 4) boundedness of
all signals when the regressor is not s-PE. The main salient feature of the

  Semantic Communications",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CL cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Semantic communication (SC) aims to communicate reliably with minimal data
transfer while simultaneously providing seamless connectivity to heterogeneous
services and users. In this paper, a novel emergent SC (ESC) system framework
is proposed and is composed of a signaling game for emergent language design
and a neuro-symbolic (NeSy) artificial intelligence (AI) approach for causal
reasoning. In order to design the language, the signaling game is solved using
an alternating maximization between the communicating node's utilities. The
emergent language helps create a context-aware transmit vocabulary (minimal
semantic representation) and aids the reasoning process (enabling
generalization to unseen scenarios) by splitting complex messages into simpler
reasoning tasks for the receiver. The causal description at the transmitter is
then modeled (a neural component) as a posterior distribution of the relevant
attributes present in the data. Using the reconstructed causal state, the
receiver evaluates a set of logical formulas (symbolic part) to execute its
task. The nodes NeSy reasoning components are implemented by the recently
proposed AI tool called Generative Flow Networks, and they are optimized for
higher semantic reliability. The ESC system is designed to enhance the novel
metrics of semantic information, reliability, distortion and similarity that
are designed using rigorous algebraic properties from category theory thereby
generalizing the metrics beyond Shannon's notion of uncertainty. Simulation
results validate the ability of ESC to communicate efficiently (with reduced
bits) and achieve better semantic reliability than conventional wireless and
state-of-the-art systems that do not exploit causal reasoning capabilities.

rapid demography (ecology) and equally rapid phenotypic changes (evolution)
leading to novel, emergent system behaviours. This focus on contemporary
dynamics is likely due to accumulating evidence for rapid evolution, from
classical laboratory microcosms and natural populations, including the iconic
Trinidadian guppies. We argue that this view is too narrow, preventing the
successful integration of ecology and evolution. While maintaining that
eco-evolution involves emergence, we highlight that this may also be true for
slow ecology and evolution which unfold over thousands or millions of years,
such as the feedbacks between riverine geomorphology and plant evolution. We
thereby integrate geomorphology and biome-level feedbacks into eco-evolution,
significantly extending its scope. Most importantly, we emphasize that
eco-evolutionary systems need not be frozen in state-space: We identify
modulators of ecological and evolutionary rates, like temperature or
sensitivity to mutation, which can synchronize or desynchronize ecology and
evolution. We speculate that global change may increase the occurrence of
eco-evolution and emergent system behaviours which represents substantial
challenges for prediction. Our perspective represents an attempt to integrate
ecology and evolution across disciplines, from gene-regulatory networks to
geomorphology and across timescales, from contemporary dynamics to deep time.

annotated samples. Typically, a prototype representing the foreground class is
extracted from annotated support image(s) and is matched to features
representing each pixel in the query image. However, models learnt in this way
are insufficiently discriminatory, and often produce false positives:
misclassifying background pixels as foreground. Some FSS methods try to address
this issue by using the background in the support image(s) to help identify the
background in the query image. However, the backgrounds of theses images is
often quite distinct, and hence, the support image background information is
uninformative. This article proposes a method, QSR, that extracts the
background from the query image itself, and as a result is better able to
discriminate between foreground and background features in the query image.
This is achieved by modifying the training process to associate prototypes with
class labels including known classes from the training data and latent classes
representing unknown background objects. This class information is then used to
extract a background prototype from the query image. To successfully associate
prototypes with class labels and extract a background prototype that is capable
of predicting a mask for the background regions of the image, the machinery for
extracting and using foreground prototypes is induced to become more
discriminative between different classes. Experiments for both 1-shot and
5-shot FSS on both the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method results in a significant improvement in performance for the
baseline methods it is applied to. As QSR operates only during training, these

devices to jeopardize confidentiality. Locating and synchronizing segments of
interest in traces from Cryptographic Processes (CPs) is a key step of the
attack. The most common method consists in generating a trigger signal to
indicate to the attacker the start of a CP. This paper proposes a method called
Virtual Triggering (VT) that removes the need for the trigger signal and
automates trace segmentation. When the time between repetitions is not
constant, further trace alignment techniques are required. Building on VT, we
propose a simple method to learn representative segment templates from a
profiling device similar to the victim, and to automatically locate and pull
out these segments from other victim devices using simple pattern recognition.
We evaluate VT on screaming channel attacks [1], which initially used a
Frequency Component (FC) known to appear at a single time in leaked signals, as
a trigger to segment traces. We demonstrate that VT not only performs
equivalently to FC on a standard attack scenario, but we also show how using VT
with the automatic pullout technique improves the attack efficiency and enables
more realistic attack scenarios. Thanks to VT, screaming channel attacks can
now: (1) succeed with only half of the segments collected compared to the FC
trigger from the original attack; and (2) absorb time variations between CPs.

Additionally, covariate shifts between simulations and actual usage can cause

present a validation method that propagates bounds on distributional
discrepancy measures through a composite system, thereby allowing us to derive
an upper bound on the failure probability of the real system from potentially

restoration of spin- and point-group symmetry, cPHF groups sites into discrete
clusters and uses a cluster-product state as the broken-symmetry reference.
Intracluster correlation is thus already included at the mean-field level and
intercluster correlation is introduced through symmetry projection. Variants of
cPHF differing in the broken and restored symmetries are evaluated for ground
states and singlet-triplet gaps of antiferromagnetic spin rings for various
cluster sizes, where cPHF in general affords a significant improvement over
ordinary PHF, although the division into clusters lowers the cyclical symmetry.
On the other hand, certain two- or three-dimensional spin arrangements permit
cluster groupings compatible with the full spatial symmetry. We accordingly
demonstrate that cPHF yields approximate ground states with correct spin and
point-group quantum numbers for honeycomb lattice fragments and symmetric

linear algebra, robotic navigation, etc., exhibit irregular data flow
computation that can be modeled with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The
irregularity arises from the seemingly random connections of nodes, which makes
the DAG structure unsuitable for vectorization on CPU or GPU. Moreover, the
nodes usually represent a small number of arithmetic operations that cannot
amortize the overhead of launching tasks/kernels for each node, further posing
challenges for parallel execution.
  To enable energy-efficient execution, this work proposes DAG processing unit
(DPU) version 2, a specialized processor architecture optimized for irregular
DAGs with static connectivity. It consists of a tree-structured datapath for
efficient data reuse, a customized banked register file, and interconnects
tuned to support irregular register accesses. DPU-v2 is utilized effectively
through a targeted compiler that systematically maps operations to the
datapath, minimizes register bank conflicts, and avoids pipeline hazards.
Finally, a design space exploration identifies the optimal architecture
configuration that minimizes the energy-delay product. This hardware-software
co-optimization approach results in a speedup of 1.4$\times$, 3.5$\times$, and
14$\times$ over a state-of-the-art DAG processor ASIP, a CPU, and a GPU,

two analytically solvable parts, and thus give a great chance to the
development and application of explicit symplectic integrators based on
operator splitting and composing. However, such constructions cannot in general
be available for curved spacetimes in general relativity and modified theories
of gravity, because these curved spacetimes correspond to nonseparable
Hamiltonians without the two part splits. Recently, several black hole
spacetimes such as the Schwarzschild black hole were found to allow the
construction of explicit symplectic integrators, since their corresponding
Hamiltonians are separable into more than two explicitly integrable pieces.
Although some other curved spacetimes including the Kerr black hole do not
exist such multi part splits, their corresponding appropriate time
transformation Hamiltonians do. In fact, the key problem for the obtainment of
symplectic analytically integrable decomposition algorithms is how to split
these Hamiltonians or time transformation Hamiltonians. Considering this idea,
we develop explicit sympelcetic schemes in curved spacetimes. We introduce a
class of spacetimes whose Hamiltonians are directly split into several
explicitly integrable terms. For example, the Hamiltonian of rotating black
ring has a 13 part split. We also present two sets of spacetimes whose
appropriate time transformation Hamiltonians have the desirable splits. For
instance, an 8 part split exists in a time-transformed Hamiltonian of
Kerr-Newman solution with disformal parameter. In this way, the proposed
symplectic splitting methods will be used widely for long-term integrations of
orbits in most curved spacetimes we have known.

degradation, when a pretrained DNN model is applied to a new testing
environment. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel approach that
allows end-users to exploit pretrained DNN models in their own testing

\textit{meta input} which is an additional input transforming the distribution

input can be optimized with a small number of testing data only by considering
the relation between testing input data and its output prediction. Also, it
does not require any knowledge of the network's internal architecture and
modification of its weight parameters. Then, the obtained meta input is added
to testing data in order to shift the distribution of testing data to that of
originally used training data. As a result, end-users can exploit well-trained
models in their own testing environment which can differ from the training
environment. We validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed meta

existing DML functions. With the help of this analysis framework, we further
propose a new family of objectives in the gradient space exploring different
gradient combinations. In the event that the gradients are not integrable to a
valid loss function, we implement our proposed objectives such that they would
directly operate in the gradient space instead of on the losses in the
embedding space. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that our novel
objectives have consistently improved performance over baselines across
different visual/text features and model frameworks. We also showed the
generalizability of the GOAL framework by extending it to other models using
triplet family losses including vision-language model with heavy cross-modal
interactions and have achieved state-of-the-art results on the image-text
retrieval tasks on COCO and Flick30K.

  Agent?","Accepted in EMNLP '22",,,,"eess.AS cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The usage of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are becoming
omnipresent ranging from personal assistant to chatbots, home, and industrial
automation systems, etc. Modern robots are also equipped with ASR capabilities
for interacting with humans as speech is the most natural interaction modality.
However, ASR in robots faces additional challenges as compared to a personal
assistant. Being an embodied agent, a robot must recognize the physical
entities around it and therefore reliably recognize the speech containing the
description of such entities. However, current ASR systems are often unable to
do so due to limitations in ASR training, such as generic datasets and
open-vocabulary modeling. Also, adverse conditions during inference, such as
noise, accented, and far-field speech makes the transcription inaccurate. In
this work, we present a method to incorporate a robot's visual information into
an ASR system and improve the recognition of a spoken utterance containing a
visible entity. Specifically, we propose a new decoder biasing technique to
incorporate the visual context while ensuring the ASR output does not degrade
for incorrect context. We achieve a 59% relative reduction in WER from an
unmodified ASR system.

  emission processes","Master Thesis, 98 pages",,,,"hep-th gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It is known that the canonical quantization of general relativity leads to a
non-renormalizable theory, which however with the modern tools of effective
field theories it is possible to make well-defined at low energies. What is
emerging nowadays is that recovering general relativity from the classical
limit of scattering amplitudes seems more efficient than actually solve the
Einstein equations. The thesis then aims to explore the state-of-the-art
strategies to recover classical gravitational observables from quantum
computations and apply them in order to reconstruct the
Reissner-Nordstr\""om-Tangherlini solution, which is the generalization to
arbitrary dimensions of the Reissner-Nordstr\""om one, from the classical limit
of scattering amplitudes of charged scalars. In the first part of the thesis,
we recover the most generic energy-ordered effective action which is compatible
with the symmetries of the theory, and then we discuss the classical limit from
which it is possible to obtain back classical gravitational observables out of
quantum computations. The state-of-the-art techniques to extract the classical
contributions out of graviton emission amplitudes are reviewed, and they are
applied to the context of a theory which is also coupled to the electromagnetic
field. Since divergences arise in four and five dimensions it is crucial to
define non-minimal couplings with the purpose of canceling such singularities
and obtaining finite results. In the end, the considerations employed in the
metric case are used to recover the electromagnetic potential associated to the
black hole solution through the classical limit of photon emission processes.
Also in this case there appear divergences that have to be renormalized. One of
the most important outcomes is that the counter-terms that have to be fixed in
order to eliminate the poles are the same throughout the theory.

for realizing nonreciprocal phase shifters and gyrators, here we propose a

shifter formed by two temporal loops. The proposed temporal apparatus operates
based on the generation of time-harmonic signals and destructive and

momentum to the system to control the phase and frequency of the two loops.
Such a temporal nonreciprocal phase shifter offers low insertion loss, and a
large return loss (input matching) of greater than 28.1 dB. Additionally, this
nonreciprocal phase shifter possesses a reconfigurable architecture and can be
directly embedded in integrated circuit (IC) technology to create high power
handling and linear IC-based nonreciprocal phase shifters.

errors. Probabilistic predictive models address this limitation by providing
probability distributions that represent a belief over plausible targets,

decision-making under uncertainty, provided that the model output is meaningful
and interpretable. Calibrated models guarantee that the probabilistic
predictions are neither over- nor under-confident. In the machine learning
literature, different measures and statistical tests have been proposed and
studied for evaluating the calibration of classification models. For regression
problems, however, research has been focused on a weaker condition of
calibration based on predicted quantiles for real-valued targets. In this
paper, we propose the first framework that unifies calibration evaluation and
tests for general probabilistic predictive models. It applies to any such
model, including classification and regression models of arbitrary dimension.
Furthermore, the framework generalizes existing measures and provides a more
intuitive reformulation of a recently proposed framework for calibration in
multi-class classification. In particular, we reformulate and generalize the
kernel calibration error, its estimators, and hypothesis tests using
scalar-valued kernels, and evaluate the calibration of real-valued regression

through multiple transitions to different spectral states during the outburst,
and the complete evolution created a q-shaped track in the hardness intensity
diagram. A partial hysteresis is also observed in the RMS-intensity diagram,
which is another well-defined phenomenon of black hole transients. In SIMS,
power density spectra were dominated by broadband noise components, and two
type B QPOs were detected. We have fitted 1-10 keV energy spectra obtained from
NICER observations that were performed during the outburst, and the temporal
evolution of spectral parameters were studied. On MJD 58584.69, a small-scale
reflare happened, and we observed that the spectral index decreased to a much
lower value associated with finite changes in other spectral parameters also,
and the 1-10 keV averaged flux also increased. We observed that the innermost
radius of the accretion disc was almost constant during the soft state, which
corresponds to the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO). We have measured the
lower limit of mass of the compact object to be approximately 4.6 M,
considering a non-spinning black hole binary system, by fitting 1-10 keV NICER
spectra with the diskbb component. The soft-to-hard transition occurred when
the bolometric luminosity was 0.01 times the Eddington luminosity. Based on our

light on completeness. We found an equivalency between linear GUP and
Bekenstein universal bound, which is a bound on the amount of information that
completely describes the physical system. linear GUP could be the theory that
incorporates Bekenstein universal bound with quantum mechanics. This
equivalency implies \emph{four} fundamental cases that explain the expansion of
the universe, aging of atoms, constancy of natural constants, and wavefunction
collapse. We found that the electron wavefunction collapses at $52.2$
picometer, which agrees with the value of the hydrogen atom radius given by
$52.9$ picometer. We explain the hydrogen nucleus radius by considering the
proton case. In that sense, linear GUP sets a connection between quantum world
and gravitational/geometric world through its ability to explain how
wavefunction collapses to form a geometry. We found an equivalency between
linear GUP and entropy-area law modified by von Neumann entropy. This
equivalency points to an information origin of momentum (motion) concept.

Therefore, the use of isomorphic meshes leads to efficient memory usage and
calculation time compared with general mesh models. As iMG is a data-free
method, preparing any point clouds as training data in advance is unnecessary,
except a point cloud of the target object used as the input data of iMG.
Additionally, iMG outputs an isomorphic mesh obtained by mapping a reference

  Vulnerabilities?","12 pages, 2 Figures",,,,"cs.CR cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the ever-increasing security breaches, practitioners are motivated to
produce more secure software. In the United States, the White House Office
released a memorandum on Executive Order (EO) 14028 that mandates organizations
provide self-attestation of the use of secure software development practices.
The OpenSSF Scorecard project allows practitioners to measure the use of
software security practices automatically. However, little research has been
done to determine whether the use of security practices improves package
security, particularly which security practices have the biggest impact on
security outcomes. The goal of this study is to assist practitioners and
researchers making informed decisions on which security practices to adopt
through the development of models between software security practice scores and
security vulnerability counts.
  To that end, we developed five supervised machine learning models for npm and
PyPI packages using the OpenSSF Scorecared security practices scores and
aggregate security scores as predictors and the number of externally-reported
vulnerabilities as a target variable. Our models found four security practices
(Maintained, Code Review, Branch Protection, and Security Policy) were the most
important practices influencing vulnerability count. However, we had low R^2
(ranging from 9% to 12%) when we tested the models to predict vulnerability
counts. Additionally, we observed that the number of reported vulnerabilities
increased rather than reduced as the aggregate security score of the packages
increased. Both findings indicate that additional factors may influence the
package vulnerability count. We suggest that vulnerability count and security
score data be refined such that these measures may be used to provide
actionable guidance on security practices.

are several issues that hamper agreement about what constitutes complexity and
how we can systematically compare the complexity of production systems. In this
work, we propose a novel approach to assess the behavioural and structural
complexity of production systems using Petri nets. Petri nets are well known
formal models commonly used in, for example, biological and business process
modelling, as well as software engineering. The use of Petri nets overcomes
several obstacles of current approaches in archaeology and anthropology, such
as the incompatibility of the intrinsic sequential logic of the available
methods with inherently non sequential processes, and the inability to
explicitly model activities and resources separately. We test the proposed
Petri net modelling approach on two traditional production systems of adhesives
made by Ju hoan makers from Nyae, Namibia from Ammocharis coranica and Ozoroa
schinzii plants. We run simulations in which we assess the complexity of these
two adhesive production systems in detail and show how Petri net dynamics
reveal the structural and behavioural complexity of different production
scenarios. We show that concurrency may be prevalent in the production system
of adhesive technologies and discuss how changes in location during the process
may serve to control the behavioural complexity of a production system. The
approach presented in this paper paves the way for future systematic
visualization, analysis, and comparison of ancient production systems,
accounting for the inherent complex, concurrent, and action and resource
oriented aspects of such processes.

The differences in the rules extracted from different geographical areas

that the differences delineated an overall north south divide in England,
however, this divide was driven mostly by London. Based on our analysis, we
demonstrate the usefulness of the dominance-based rough sets approach for

venture capital. Each new wave of capital inflows has been epitomized by a new
type of investment vehicle, may it be ICOs, DAOs, or NFTs. Regrettably, none of
these paradigms tried to address the issue of investor protection, a pillar of
efficient capital markets. Moreover, very few projects tried to generate
economic revenue, focusing instead on marketing alone to attract new investors.
Without revenues, price discovery was impossible, while investors were left
without any protection against rug pulls. This has forced regulators to take a
hard-line approach to the ecosystem, and rule that certain tokens are
securities when they are not intended to be. Regulators have left the door open
to cryptocurrencies with truly decentralised activity like Ethereum, most
notably the SEC in its interpretation of the Howey test for digital assets. We
believe that a great number of decentralised projects could benefit from this
regulatory exception. A system where project revenue is automatically directed
to a treasury pool, and the price of tokens is computed following a
predetermined bonding curve, would allow to efficiently raise capital, while
investors would have automatic guarantees of fair participation in the success
of the project. Such a framework would incentivise founders to design
decentralised projects that create value instead of hype, while making the
application of securities laws less stringent or even needed. NFT royalties in
particular are an example of decentralised economic activity that generates
cash flows, used to back the value of associated tokens. We propose a
cryptographic system that ties the price of tokens to the success of a
decentralised activity, guarantees the fair distribution of tokens, and rewards
founders and participants in the system in line with the amount of risk they
are taking.

in online intelligent services, more and more deep learning models are
offloaded from the cloud to mobile devices. To further deal with cross-device
data heterogeneity, the offloaded models normally need to be fine-tuned with
each individual user's local samples before being put into real-time inference.
In this work, we focus on the fundamental click-through rate (CTR) prediction
task in recommender systems and study how to effectively and efficiently
perform on-device fine-tuning. We first identify the bottleneck issue that each
individual user's local CTR (i.e., the ratio of positive samples in the local
dataset for fine-tuning) tends to deviate from the global CTR (i.e., the ratio
of positive samples in all the users' mixed datasets on the cloud for training
out the initial model). We further demonstrate that such a CTR drift problem
makes on-device fine-tuning even harmful to item ranking. We thus propose a
novel label correction method, which requires each user only to change the
labels of the local samples ahead of on-device fine-tuning and can well align
the locally prior CTR with the global CTR. The offline evaluation results over
three datasets and five CTR prediction models as well as the online A/B testing
results in Mobile Taobao demonstrate the necessity of label correction in
on-device fine-tuning and also reveal the improvement over cloud-based learning
without fine-tuning.

and ponds. Silver Carp are much slower and exhibit lower persistence in their
speeds when under shade than out of it during daytime and nighttime, with fish
displaying the highest persistence degree and speeds at night. Furthermore, our
research shows that shade affects fish schooling behavior by reducing their
polarization, number of interactions among individuals, and the stability among
local neighbors; however, fish keep a higher local degree of order when under
shade compared to nighttime positions.
