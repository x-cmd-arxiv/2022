participate or not, which leads to participation bias: the individuals willing
to share their data might not be representative of the entire population.
Similarly, there are cases where one does not have direct access to any data of
the target population and has to resort to publicly available proxy data
sampled from a different distribution. In this paper, we present Differentially
Private Propensity Scores for Bias Correction (DiPPS), a method for
approximating the true data distribution of interest in both of the above
settings. We assume that the data analyst has access to a dataset $\tilde{D}$
that was sampled from the distribution of interest in a biased way. As
individuals may be more willing to share their data when given a privacy
guarantee, we further assume that the analyst is allowed locally differentially
private access to a set of samples $D$ from the true, unbiased distribution.
Each data point from the private, unbiased dataset $D$ is mapped to a
probability distribution over clusters (learned from the biased dataset
$\tilde{D}$), from which a single cluster is sampled via the exponential
mechanism and shared with the data analyst. This way, the analyst gathers a
distribution over clusters, which they use to compute propensity scores for the
points in the biased $\tilde{D}$, which are in turn used to reweight the points
in $\tilde{D}$ to approximate the true data distribution. It is now possible to
compute any function on the resulting reweighted dataset without further access
to the private $D$. In experiments on datasets from various domains, we show
that DiPPS successfully brings the distribution of the available dataset closer
to the distribution of interest in terms of Wasserstein distance. We further
show that this results in improved estimates for different statistics.

We show that generally, a smaller utilization leads to more efficient

electrons/ protons accelerated to a high energy power law of a few per-cents.
All these values are directly derived from the observed TeV and X-ray fluxes.
They are consistent with both late time data at all bands, from radio to

classification based on probabilistic modeling and optimal decision theory that
minimizes the convex combination of false classification rates. The
classification process is challenging when the relative fraction of the

develop a method for estimating the generalized prevalence of test data that is

leveraging temporal information for video object detection. The feature
aggregation in modern region-based video object detectors heavily relies on
learned proposals generated from a single-frame RPN. This imminently introduces
additional components like NMS and produces unreliable proposals on low-quality
frames. To tackle these restrictions, we present SparseVOD, a novel video
object detection pipeline that employs Sparse R-CNN to exploit temporal
information. In particular, we introduce two modules in the dynamic head of
Sparse R-CNN. First, the Temporal Feature Extraction module based on the
Temporal RoI Align operation is added to extract the RoI proposal features.
Second, motivated by sequence-level semantic aggregation, we incorporate the
attention-guided Semantic Proposal Feature Aggregation module to enhance object
feature representation before detection. The proposed SparseVOD effectively
alleviates the overhead of complicated post-processing methods and makes the
overall pipeline end-to-end trainable. Extensive experiments show that our
method significantly improves the single-frame Sparse RCNN by 8%-9% in mAP.
Furthermore, besides achieving state-of-the-art 80.3% mAP on the ImageNet VID
dataset with ResNet-50 backbone, our SparseVOD outperforms existing
proposal-based methods by a significant margin on increasing IoU thresholds
(IoU > 0.5).

set of action names, the goal classification instances in the domain are solved
by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A run of the RNN processes a trace of
observed actions to compute how likely it is that each domain proposition is
part of the agent's goal, for the problem instance under considerations. These
predictions are then aggregated to choose one of the candidate goals. The only

the process industry. However, the satisfactory control performance of a PID
controller depends strongly on the tuning parameters. Conventional PID tuning
methods require extensive knowledge of the system model, which is not always
known especially in the case of complex dynamical systems. In contrast,
reinforcement learning-based PID tuning has gained popularity since it can
treat PID tuning as a black-box problem and deliver the optimal PID parameters
without requiring explicit process models. In this paper, we present a novel
entropy-maximizing twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (EMTD3)
method for automating the PID tuning. In the proposed method, an
entropy-maximizing stochastic actor is employed at the beginning to encourage
the exploration of the action space. Then a deterministic actor is deployed to
focus on local exploitation and discover the optimal solution. The
incorporation of the entropy-maximizing term can significantly improve the
sample efficiency and assist in fast convergence to the global solution. Our
proposed method is applied to the PID tuning of a second-order system to verify
its effectiveness in improving the sample efficiency and discovering the
optimal PID parameters compared to traditional TD3.

task in computer graphics and computer vision. Traditional techniques directly
construct a surface mesh using local decision heuristics, while some recent
methods based on neural implicit representations try to leverage data-driven
approaches for this meshing process. However, it is challenging to define a
learnable representation for triangle meshes of unknown topology and size and
for this reason, neural implicit representations rely on non-differentiable
post-processing in order to extract the final triangle mesh. In this work, we
propose a novel differentiable meshing algorithm for extracting surface meshes
from neural implicit representations. Our method produces the mesh in an
iterative fashion, which makes it applicable to shapes of various scales and
adaptive to the local curvature of the shape. Furthermore, our method produces
meshes with regular tessellation patterns and fewer triangle faces compared to
existing methods. Experiments demonstrate the comparable reconstruction

massive and compact galaxies, where strong gas inflows have triggered an
extreme star formation episode and nearly $100\%$ LyC photons are escaping.

challenging due to the computational cost, limited quantities of high quality

introduce a new model for learning video representation which compresses the
video to a small representation of discrete tokens. This tokenizer uses causal
attention in time, which allows it to work with variable-length videos. To
generate video tokens from text we are using a bidirectional masked transformer
conditioned on pre-computed text tokens. The generated video tokens are
subsequently de-tokenized to create the actual video. To address data issues,
we demonstrate how joint training on a large corpus of image-text pairs as well
as a smaller number of video-text examples can result in generalization beyond
what is available in the video datasets. Compared to the previous video
generation methods, Phenaki can generate arbitrary long videos conditioned on a
sequence of prompts (i.e. time variable text or a story) in open domain. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first time a paper studies generating videos
from time variable prompts. In addition, compared to the per-frame baselines,
the proposed video encoder-decoder computes fewer tokens per video but results

space that is closest to the query point. The brute-force approach for finding
the nearest neighbor becomes computationally infeasible when the number of
points is large. The NNS has multiple applications in medicine, such as
searching large medical imaging databases, disease classification, diagnosis,

effective and efficient algorithm that searches and retrieves the relevant
images from heterogeneous sources of medical images. Towards this, given a
medical database, the proposed algorithm builds the index that consists of
pre-computed links of each point in the database. The search algorithm utilizes
the index to efficiently traverse the database in search of the nearest
neighbor. We extensively tested the proposed NNS approach and compared the
performance with state-of-the-art NNS approaches on benchmark datasets and our
created medical image datasets. The proposed approach outperformed the existing
approach in terms of retrieving accurate neighbors and retrieval speed. We also
explore the role of medical image feature representation in content-based
medical image retrieval tasks. We propose a Transformer-based feature

To address this, we propose Decomposed Prompting, a new approach to solve

with more effective prompts, trained models, or symbolic functions if desired.
We show that the flexibility and modularity of Decomposed Prompting allows it
to outperform prior work on few-shot prompting using GPT3. On symbolic
reasoning tasks, we can further decompose sub-tasks that are hard for LLMs into
even simpler solvable sub-tasks. When the complexity comes from the input
length, we can recursively decompose the task into the same task but with
smaller inputs. We also evaluate our approach on textual multi-step reasoning
tasks: on long-context multi-hop QA task, we can more effectively teach the
sub-tasks via our separate sub-tasks prompts; and on open-domain multi-hop QA,
we can incorporate a symbolic information retrieval within our decomposition

we address the diversity evaluation problem by proposing the Vendi Score, which
connects and extends ideas from ecology and quantum statistical mechanics to
ML. The Vendi Score is defined as the exponential of the Shannon entropy of the
eigenvalues of a similarity matrix. This matrix is induced by a user-defined
similarity function applied to the sample to be evaluated for diversity. In
taking a similarity function as input, the Vendi Score enables its user to
specify any desired form of diversity. Importantly, unlike many existing
metrics in ML, the Vendi Score doesn't require a reference dataset or
distribution over samples or labels, it is therefore general and applicable to
any generative model, decoding algorithm, and dataset from any domain where
similarity can be defined. We showcased the Vendi Score on molecular generative
modeling, a domain where diversity plays an important role in enabling the
discovery of novel molecules. We found that the Vendi Score addresses
shortcomings of the current diversity metric of choice in that domain. We also
applied the Vendi Score to generative models of images and decoding algorithms
of text and found it confirms known results about diversity in those domains.
Furthermore, we used the Vendi Score to measure mode collapse, a known
limitation of generative adversarial networks (GANs). In particular, the Vendi
Score revealed that even GANs that capture all the modes of a labeled dataset
can be less diverse than the original dataset. Finally, the interpretability of
the Vendi Score allowed us to diagnose several benchmark ML datasets for

overparameterization factor is necessary at least for 3-layer random networks,
which elucidates the observed degrading performance of random networks at
higher sparsity. At moderate to high sparsity levels, however, our results
imply that sparser networks are contained within random source networks so that
any dense-to-sparse training scheme can be turned into a computationally more
efficient sparse-to-sparse one by constraining the search to a fixed random
mask. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in experiments for

samples from mixture $\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^{k}\mathcal{N}(\mu_j, I_d)$, the
goal is to estimate the means $\mu_1, \mu_2, \ldots, \mu_k \in \mathbb{R}^d$ up
to a small error. The hardness of this learning problem can be measured by the
separation $\Delta$ defined as the minimum distance between all pairs of means.
Regev and Vijayaraghavan (2017) showed that with $\Delta = \Omega(\sqrt{\log
k})$ separation, the means can be learned using $\mathrm{poly}(k, d)$ samples,
whereas super-polynomially many samples are required if $\Delta = o(\sqrt{\log
k})$ and $d = \Omega(\log k)$. This leaves open the low-dimensional regime
where $d = o(\log k)$.
  In this work, we give an algorithm that efficiently learns the means in $d =
O(\log k/\log\log k)$ dimensions under separation $d/\sqrt{\log k}$ (modulo
doubly logarithmic factors). This separation is strictly smaller than
$\sqrt{\log k}$, and is also shown to be necessary. Along with the results of
Regev and Vijayaraghavan (2017), our work almost pins down the critical
separation threshold at which efficient parameter learning becomes possible for
spherical Gaussian mixtures. More generally, our algorithm runs in time
$\mathrm{poly}(k)\cdot f(d, \Delta, \epsilon)$, and is thus fixed-parameter
tractable in parameters $d$, $\Delta$ and $\epsilon$.
  Our approach is based on estimating the Fourier transform of the mixture at
carefully chosen frequencies, and both the algorithm and its analysis are
simple and elementary. Our positive results can be easily extended to learning
mixtures of non-Gaussian distributions, under a mild condition on the Fourier
spectrum of the distribution.

While this variant of GD has been well-studied in the literature for objectives
with globally Lipschitz continuous gradients or by requiring bounded iterates,
objectives from data science problems do not satisfy such assumptions. Thus, in
this work, we provide a novel global convergence analysis of GD with
diminishing step sizes for differentiable nonconvex functions whose gradients
are only locally Lipschitz continuous. Specifically, we show that the iterates
either approach a region of zero gradient infinitely often or diverge. Under a
more stringent requirement on the step sizes, we show that the iterates either
converge to a stationary point or diverge. Furthermore, to expound on the
divergence regime, we construct an example for which GD with diminishing step
sizes diverges, its objective function diverges, and its gradient remains
bounded away from zero. Finally, we address a conflict that our analysis raises
with that of continuous GD. In particular, we show that continuous GD has
solutions that do not exist for GD with diminishing step sizes. Thus, we
provide the most general global convergence analysis of GD with diminishing
step size, and we supply a warning to the data science community: the

Therefore there is an impending need to quantify the uncertainty of such
explanation methods in order to understand when explanations are trustworthy.
In this work we propose the Gaussian Process Explanation unCertainty (GPEC)
framework, which generates a unified uncertainty estimate combining decision
boundary-aware uncertainty with explanation function approximation uncertainty.
We introduce a novel geodesic-based kernel, which captures the complexity of
the target black-box decision boundary. We show theoretically that the proposed
kernel similarity increases with decision boundary complexity. The proposed
framework is highly flexible; it can be used with any black-box classifier and
feature attribution method. Empirical results on multiple tabular and image
datasets show that the GPEC uncertainty estimate improves understanding of
explanations as compared to existing methods.

formation research. Observations of disk fractions in star clusters imply
median disk lifetimes of 1 -- 3 Myr. This very short disk lifetime calls for
planet formation to occur extremely rapidly. We show that young, distant
clusters ($\leq$ 5 Myr, $>$ 200 pc) often dominate these types of studies. Such
clusters frequently suffer from limiting magnitudes leading to an
over-representation of high-mass stars. As high-mass stars disperse their disks
earlier, the derived disk lifetimes apply best to high-mass stars rather than
low-mass stars. Including only nearby clusters ($<$ 200 pc) minimizes the
effect of limiting magnitude. In this case, the median disk lifetime of
low-mass stars is with 5 -- 10 Myr, thus much longer than often claimed. The
longer timescales provide planets ample time to form. How high-mass stars form
planets so much faster than low-mass stars is the next grand challenges.

closed quantum systems. By this effect, quantum information spreads throughout
the system and becomes hidden in the form of non-local correlations.
Alternatively, it can be described in terms of the increase in complexity and
spatial support of operators in the Heisenberg picture, a phenomenon known as
operator growth. In this work, we study the disordered fully-connected
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and we demonstrate that scrambling is absent for
disorder-averaged expectation values of observables. In detail, we adopt a
formalism typical of open quantum systems to show that, on average and within
charge-conserved sectors, operators evolve in a relatively simple way which is
governed by their operator size. This feature only affects single-time
correlation functions, and in particular it does not hold for out-of-time-order
correlators, which are well-known to show scrambling behavior. Making use of
these findings, we develop a cumulant expansion approach to approximate the
evolution of equal-time observables. We employ this scheme to obtain analytic
results that apply to arbitrary system size, and we benchmark its effectiveness
by exact numerics. Our findings shed light on the structure of the dynamics of
observables in the SYK model, and provide an approximate numerical description

wide range of programs. However, such techniques only support complete and
detailed specifications, which places an undue burden on users. To solve this
problem, prior work proposed gradual verification, which handles complete,
partial, or missing specifications by soundly combining static and dynamic
checking. Gradual verification has also been extended to programs that
manipulate recursive, mutable data structures on the heap. Unfortunately, this
extension does not reward users with decreased dynamic checking as
specifications are refined. In fact, all properties are checked dynamically
regardless of any static guarantees. Additionally, no full-fledged
implementation of gradual verification exists so far, which prevents studying
its performance and applicability in practice.
  We present Gradual C0, the first practical gradual verifier for recursive
heap data structures, which targets C0, a safe subset of C designed for
education. To minimize insertion of dynamic checks and support efficiency,
Gradual C0 adopts symbolic execution at its core, instead of the backwards
reasoning of weakest liberal preconditions used in prior work. Our approach
addresses technical challenges related to symbolic execution with imprecise
specifications, heap ownership, and branching in both program statements and
specification formulas. Finally, we provide the first empirical performance
evaluation of a gradual verifier, and found that on average, Gradual C0
decreases run-time overhead between 50-90% compared to the fully-dynamic
approach used in prior work. Further, the worst-case scenarios for performance
are predictable and avoidable. This work paves the way towards evaluating
gradual verification at scale.

planets are more likely to orbit around more massive stars. In the first
scenario, we estimate that the lens system is likely to be a planet of mass
$m_\mathrm{planet} = 46^{+42}_{-24} \; M_\oplus$ and a host star of mass
$M_\mathrm{host} = 0.43^{+0.39}_{-0.23} \; M_\odot$, located at a distance $D_L

interplay of spin and motional degrees of freedom constitutes one of the
central challenges in strongly correlated many-body physics. When holes move
through an antiferromagnetic spin background, they displace the positions of
spins, which in turn induces effective frustration in the magnetic environment.
However, a concrete characterization of this effect in a quantum many-body
system is still an unsolved problem. Here we introduce a Hamiltonian
reconstruction scheme that allows for a precise quantification of
hole-motion-induced frustration. In particular, we access non-local correlation
functions through projective measurements of the many-body state, from which
effective spin-Hamiltonians can be recovered after detaching the magnetic
background from dominant charge fluctuations. The scheme is applied to systems
of mixed dimensionality, where holes are restricted to move in one dimension
(1D), but $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ superexchange is two-dimensional (2D). We
demonstrate that hole motion drives the spin background into a highly
frustrated spin liquid regime, reminiscent of Anderson's resonating valence
bond paradigm in doped cuprates. We exemplify the direct applicability of the
reconstruction scheme to ultracold atom experiments by recovering effective
spin-Hamiltonians of experimentally obtained 1D Fermi-Hubbard snapshots. Our
method can be generalized to fully 2D systems, enabling an unprecedented
microscopic perspective on the doped Hubbard model.

given a natural language prompt that demonstrates how to perform the task and
no additional training. Prompting is a brittle process wherein small
modifications to the prompt can cause large variations in the model
predictions, and therefore significant effort is dedicated towards designing a
painstakingly ""perfect prompt"" for a task. To mitigate the high degree of
effort involved in prompt-design, we instead ask whether producing multiple
effective, yet imperfect, prompts and aggregating them can lead to a high
quality prompting strategy. Our observations motivate our proposed prompting
method, ASK ME ANYTHING (AMA). We first develop an understanding of the
effective prompt formats, finding that question-answering (QA) prompts, which
encourage open-ended generation (""Who went to the park?"") tend to outperform
those that restrict the model outputs (""John went to the park. Output True or
False.""). Our approach recursively uses the LLM itself to transform task inputs
to the effective QA format. We apply the collected prompts to obtain several
noisy votes for the input's true label. We find that the prompts can have very
different accuracies and complex dependencies and thus propose to use weak
supervision, a procedure for combining the noisy predictions, to produce the
final predictions for the inputs. We evaluate AMA across open-source model
families (e.g., EleutherAI, BLOOM, OPT, and T0) and model sizes (125M-175B
parameters), demonstrating an average performance lift of 10.2% over the

the cold start problem in vision active learning, caused by a biased and
outlier initial query. This paper seeks to address the cold start problem by
exploiting the three advantages of contrastive learning: (1) no annotation is
required; (2) label diversity is ensured by pseudo-labels to mitigate bias; (3)
typical data is determined by contrastive features to reduce outliers.
Experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10-LT and three medical imaging datasets

to calculate the anomaly indicators of a (2+1)$D$ topological order with a

These anomaly indicators are partition functions of the (3+1)$D$ topological

they are expressed using the data characterizing the topological order and the
symmetry actions. Our framework is applied to derive the anomaly indicators for

makes the differences in the soft tissues echogenicities' apparent and clear,
it fails in describing and estimating the soft tissue mechanical properties. It
cannot portray their mechanical properties, such as the elasticity and
stiffness. Estimating the mechanical properties increases chances of the
identification of lesions or any pathological changes. Physicians are now
characterizing the tissue's mechanical properties as diagnostic metrics.
Estimating the tissue's mechanical properties is achieved by applying an
Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) on the tissue and calculating the
resulted shear wave speed. Due to the difficulty of calculating the shear wave
speed precisely inside the tissue, it is estimated by analyzing ultrasound
images of the tissue at a very high frame rate. In this study, the shear wave
speed is estimated using finite element analysis. A two-dimensional model is
constructed to simulate the tissue's mechanical properties. For a generalized
soft tissue model, Agar-gelatine model is used because it has similar
properties to the soft tissue. A point force is applied at the center of the
proposed model. As a result of this force, a deformation is caused. Peak
displacements are tracked along the lateral dimension of the model to estimate
the shear wave speed of the propagating wave using the Time-To-Peak

Angular Differential Imaging (ADI) and Polarimetric Differential Imaging (PDI)
cope with drawbacks such as self-subtraction. To address these drawbacks we
explore Iterative Angular Differential Imaging (IADI) techniques to increase
signal throughput in total intensity observations. This work aims to explore
the effectiveness of IADI to recover the self-subtracted regions of disks by
applying ADI techniques iteratively. To determine the effectiveness of IADI a
model of a disk image is made and post-processed with IADI. In addition,
masking based on polarimetric images and a signal threshold for feeding back
signal are explored. Asymmetries are a very important factor in recovering the
disk due to less overlap of the disk in the data set. In some cases, a factor
75 more flux could be recovered with IADI compared to ADI. The Procrustes
distance is used to quantify the impact of the algorithm on the scattering
phase function. Depending on the level of noise and the ratio between the
stellar signal and disk signal, the phase function can be recovered a factor
6.4 in Procrustes distance better than standard ADI. The amplification and
smearing of noise over the image due to many iterations did occur and by using
binary masks and a dynamic threshold this feedback was mitigated, but it still
is a problem in the final pipeline. Lastly observations of protoplanetary disks
made with VLT/SPHERE were processed with IADI giving rise to very promising
results. While IADI has problems with low signal-to-noise observations due to
noise amplification and star reconstruction, higher signal-to-noise
observations show promising results with respect to standard ADI.

is the returning Thouless pump, where an integer number of charges are pumped

symmetries can stable the boundary states of a delicate TI beyond the

show that the fiducial Simba model which includes AGN jet feedback is the
preferred fit to the observed CDD of the $z = 0.1$ Lyman-$\alpha$ forest across
five orders of magnitude in column density. We show that the Simba results with
jets produce a quantitatively better fit to the observational data than the
Simba results without jets, even when the UVB is left as a free parameter. AGN
jets in Simba are high speed, collimated, weakly-interacting with the
interstellar medium (via brief hydrodynamic decoupling) and heated to the halo
virial temperature. Collectively these properties result in stronger long-range
impacts on the IGM when compared to TNG's kinetic feedback mode, which drives
isotropic winds with lower velocities at the galactic radius. Our results

randomly switching between the two protocols without information loss while
still measuring error syndromes. We call this more general aperiodic structure
`dynamic tree codes', which we also generalize to three dimensions. We

(FRs and SRs) according to the degree of ordered rotation of their stellar
populations. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations indicate that galaxies
form as FRs before their rotational support decreases, usually because of
mergers.
  Aims: We aimed to investigate this process observationally for galaxies
outside of clusters.
  Methods: We made use of the fact that different merger types leave different
traces that have different lifetimes. We statistically analyzed multiple
characteristics of galaxies that are expected to be influenced by mergers, such
as tidal features, kinematically distinct cores, and stellar ages. They were
taken from the MATLAS and ATLAS$^\mathrm{3D}$ databases. Through multilinear
regression we identified the quantities that, at a fixed mass and environmental
density of the galaxy, significantly correlate with a measure of the ordered
rotation of the galaxy, $\lambda_{R_e}^N$.
  Results: We found a negative correlation of the rotational support with the
occurrence of tidal disturbances and kinematic substructures, and a positive
correlation with metallicity and metallicity gradients. For massive galaxies,
the rotational support correlates negatively with the abundance of alpha
elements, and for the galaxies in low-density environments, it correlates
negatively with the central photometric cuspiness. These and additional
literature observational constraints are explained the easiest if the mergers
that decreased the rotational support of ETGs were typically minor, wet, and
happening at $z\approx 2$. They did not form the currently observed tidal
features. The observed frequency of tidal features implies a merging rate of
0.07-0.2 per Gyr. This is insufficient to explain the observed growth of the
radii of ETGs with redshift by mergers.

  Controller","6 pages, 5 figures, submitted to American Control Conference 2023",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data-driven controls using Gaussian process regression have recently gained
much attention. In such approaches, system identification by Gaussian process
regression is mostly followed by model-based controller designs. However, the
outcomes of Gaussian process regression are often too complicated to apply
conventional control designs, which makes the numerical design such as model
predictive control employed in many cases. To overcome the restriction, our
idea is to perform Gaussian process regression to the inverse of the plant with
the same input/output data for the conventional regression. With the inverse,
one can design a model reference controller without resorting to numerical
control methods. This paper considers single-input single-output (SISO)
discrete-time nonlinear systems of minimum phase with relative degree one. It
is highlighted that the model reference Gaussian process regression controller
is designed directly from pre-collected input/output data without system
identification.

rationales without annotations, we leverage in-context learning. Specifically,
we generate silver annotated data by sending a series of prompts to a frozen
pretrained language model, which acts as a teacher. We then fine-tune a smaller
student model by training on the subset of rationales that led to correct
answers. The student is ""honest"" in the sense that it is a pipeline: the
rationale acts as a bottleneck between the passage and the answer, while the
""untrusted"" teacher operates under no such constraints. Thus, we offer a new
way to build trustworthy pipeline systems from a combination of end-task

interest. From the theory and simulation standpoint, two issues are still open;
The first is the so-called transition-dipole phase problem. It has been
recognized that the dipoles must be treated as complex-valued quantities, and
that their corresponding Berry connections must be included to ensure
phase-gauge invariance. However, while this has been successfully implemented
for lower-dimensional systems, fully vectorial and three-dimensional
simulations remain to be challenging. The second issue concerns the symmetry of
the high-harmonic response, when simulations sometimes fail to honor the
symmetry of the crystalline material. This work addresses both of these
problems with the help of a HHG-simulation approach which a) is manifestly free
of the transition-dipole phase problem, b) does not require calculation of
dipole moments, c) can account for the contributions from the entire Brillouin
zone, d) faithfully preserves the symmetry of the simulated crystalline
material. We use the method to show that high-harmonic sources are distributed
throughout the Brillouin zone with various phase-shifts giving rise to
significant cancellations. As a consequence, for the simulated response to
correctly capture the material symmetry, contributions from the entire
Brillouin zone must be included. Our results have important implications for a
number of HHG applications, including all-optical bandand
dipole-reconstruction.

sometimes trained on alternative data, are increasingly being used to determine
access to credit, yet research has shown that machine learning can encode many
different versions of ""unfairness,"" thus raising the concern that banks and
other financial institutions could -- potentially unwittingly -- engage in
illegal discrimination through the use of this technology. In the US, there are
laws in place to make sure discrimination does not happen in lending and
agencies charged with enforcing them. However, conversations around fair credit
models in computer science and in policy are often misaligned: fair machine
learning research often lacks legal and practical considerations specific to
existing fair lending policy, and regulators have yet to issue new guidance on
how, if at all, credit risk models should be utilizing practices and techniques
from the research community. This paper aims to better align these sides of the
conversation. We describe the current state of credit discrimination regulation
in the United States, contextualize results from fair ML research to identify
the specific fairness concerns raised by the use of machine learning in
lending, and discuss regulatory opportunities to address these concerns.

evidence that the virial BH masses are susceptible to a positive
luminosity-dependent bias (BH mass is overestimated when luminosity is above
the average), and that the mean Eddington ratio increases with BH mass. Our
models provide reliable constraints on the z ~ 6 black hole mass function at

long short-term memory (LSTM) model that takes the final depression decision. A
modified version of the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)
is further used to identify the impact of the low-level spectrotemporal vowel

depression likelihood. The proposed method outperforms baselines that model the
spectrotemporal information in speech without integrating the vowel-based
information, as well as ML models trained with conventional prosodic and
spectrotemporal features. The conducted explainability analysis indicates that
spectrotemporal information corresponding to non-vowel segments less important
than the vowel-based information. Explainability of the high-level information
capturing the segment-by-segment decisions is further inspected for
participants with and without depression. The findings from this work can
provide the foundation toward knowledge-driven interpretable decision-support

confined to two (or one) spatial dimensions offers many possibilities that are
distinct from bosons and fermions. We call such particles anyons. The simplest
anyons are parameterized by an angular phase parameter $\theta$. $\theta = 0,
\pi$ correspond to bosons and fermions respectively; at intermediate values we
say that we have fractional statistics. In two dimensions, $\theta$ describes
the phase acquired by the wave function as two anyons wind around one another
counterclockwise. It generates a shift in the allowed values for the relative
angular momentum. Composites of localized electric charge and magnetic flux
associated with an abelian U(1) gauge group realize this behavior. More complex
charge-flux constructions can involve non-abelian and product groups acting on
a spectrum of allowed charges and fluxes, giving rise to nonabelian and mutual
statistics. Interchanges of non-abelian anyons implement unitary
transformations of the wave function within an emergent space of internal
states. Anyons of all kinds are described by quantum field theories that
include Chern--Simons terms. The crossings of one-dimensional anyons on a ring
are uni-directional, such that a fractional phase $\theta$ acquired upon
interchange gives rise to fractional shifts in the relative momenta between the
anyons. The quasiparticle excitations of fractional quantum Hall states have
long been predicted to include anyons. Recently the anyon behavior predicted
for quasiparticles in the $\nu = 1/3$ fractional quantum Hall state has been
observed both in scattering and in interferometric experiments. Excitations
within designed systems, notably including superconducting circuits, can
exhibit anyon behavior. Such systems are being developed for possible use in
quantum information processing.

propose protocols to generate a series of multiphoton states in primary output
port, by injecting a coherent state in primary input port and two Fock states
in two ancillary input ports, and measuring two Fock states in two ancillary
output ports. Only manipulating at the single-photon level (i.e, |0> or |1>) in
all ancillary ports, we generate sixteen types (six categories) of multiphoton
nonclassical states, whose state vectors are unified as superposition of a new
coherent state, a single-photon added coherent state, and a two-photon added
coherent state. Indeed, a wide range of nonclassical phenomena can be created
by modulating the interaction parameters (including coherent field strength and
shift phase). We mainly analyze quadrature-squeezing effects for all our
considered states. Of particular interest is maximum squeezing of up to 2.57dB,
with success probability 6.7%, at least in our present cases.

of multidimensional hyperspectral transmission electron microscopy datasets,
such as 4D-STEM, a routine. However, many microscopists find such experiments
daunting since such datasets' analysis, collection, long-term storage, and
networking remain challenging. Some common issues are the large and unwieldy
size of the said datasets, often running into several gigabytes,
non-standardized data analysis routines, and a lack of clarity about the
computing and network resources needed to utilize the electron microscope
fully. However, the existing computing and networking bottlenecks introduce
significant penalties in each step of these experiments, and thus, real-time
analysis-driven automated experimentation for multidimensional TEM is
exceptionally challenging. One solution is integrating microscopy with edge
computing, where moderately powerful computational hardware performs the
preliminary analysis before handing off the heavier computation to HPC systems.
In this perspective, we trace the roots of computation in modern electron
microscopy, demonstrate deep learning experiments running on an edge system,
and discuss the networking requirements for tying together microscopes, edge
computers, and HPC systems.

nanogap structures is demonstrated. The plasmonic absorption is sensed
utilizing photoacoustic (PA) detection technique. The laser diode is modulated
to generate the PA excitation that oscillates the air-filled cell. When light
absorption increases, an enhanced acoustic signal is captured by a microphone.
The observed enhancement in the PA response is related to plasmonic absorption
by the Au layers and the response is further enhanced by about 20% due to CdSe
QDs. In our structure, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) wavelength is
approximately 500 nm. The SPR is utilized for generating photocurrents in CdSe
quantum dots. Due to energy transfer from the dot to closely spaced Au surface
through thiol links, a smooth transmission channel of electrons is established
that forms a detectable photocurrent, which can be tuned by a bias voltage.
These plasmonic nanogap structures can enable higher sensitivity in

used. However, the performance gain from using end-to-end DL models compared to
conventional ML approaches is usually significant but moderate, typically at
the cost of increased computational load and deteriorated explainability. The
core idea behind deep learning approaches is scaling the performance with
bigger datasets. However, brain signals are temporal data with a low
signal-to-noise ratio, uncertain labels, and nonstationary data in time. Those
factors may influence the training process and slow down the models'
performance improvement. These factors' influence may differ for end-to-end DL
model and one using hand-crafted features. As not studied before, this paper
compares models that use raw ECoG signal and time-frequency features for BCI
motor imagery decoding. We investigate whether the current dataset size is a
stronger limitation for any models. Finally, obtained filters were compared to
identify differences between hand-crafted features and optimized with
backpropagation. To compare the effectiveness of both strategies, we used a
multilayer perceptron and a mix of convolutional and LSTM layers that were
already proved effective in this task. The analysis was performed on the
long-term clinical trial database (almost 600 minutes of recordings) of a
tetraplegic patient executing motor imagery tasks for 3D hand translation. For
a given dataset, the results showed that end-to-end training might not be
significantly better than the hand-crafted features-based model. The
performance gap is reduced with bigger datasets, but considering the increased

observations from 2017 to 2020 performed with a multitude of instruments,
involving, among others, MAGIC, Fermi-LAT, NuSTAR, Swift, GASP-WEBT, and OVRO.
Mrk 501 showed an extremely low broadband activity, which may help to unravel
its baseline emission. Nonetheless, significant flux variations are detected at
all wavebands, with the highest occurring at X-rays and very-high-energy (VHE)
$\gamma$-rays. A significant correlation ($>$3$\sigma$) between X-rays and VHE
$\gamma$-rays is measured, supporting leptonic scenarios to explain the
variable parts of the emission, also during low activity. This is further
supported when we extend our data from 2008 to 2020, and identify, for the
first time, significant correlations between Swift-XRT and Fermi-LAT. We
additionally find correlations between high-energy $\gamma$-rays and radio,
with the radio lagging by more than 100 days, placing the $\gamma$-ray emission
zone upstream of the radio-bright regions in the jet. Furthermore, Mrk 501
showed a historically low activity in X-rays and VHE $\gamma$-rays from
mid-2017 to mid-2019 with a stable VHE flux ($>$0.2 TeV) of 5% the emission of
the Crab Nebula. The broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of this
2-year-long low-state, the potential baseline emission of Mrk 501, can be
characterized with one-zone leptonic models, and with (lepto)-hadronic models
fulfilling neutrino flux constraints from IceCube. We explore the time
evolution of the SED towards the low-state, revealing that the stable baseline
emission may be ascribed to a standing shock, and the variable emission to an
additional expanding or traveling shock.

unconditional stability, which enables these methods to preserve symplectic
structure, energy, momentum and other Noether charges over long time periods.
We apply Noether's theorem to the master fields of black hole perturbation
theory on a hyperboloidal slice of Schwarzschild spacetime to show that there
exist constants of evolution that numerical simulations must preserve. We
demonstrate that time-symmetric integration schemes based on a 2-point Taylor
expansion (such as Hermite integration) numerically conserve these quantities,
unlike schemes based on a 1-point Taylor expansion (such as Runge-Kutta). This
makes time-symmetric schemes ideal for long-time EMRI simulations.

a single still input photograph. We first segment the water surface, estimate
rendering parameters, and compute water reflection textures with a combination
of neural networks and traditional optimization techniques. Then we propose an
image-based screen space local reflection model to render the water surface
overlaid on the input image and generate real-time water animation. Our
approach creates realistic results with no user intervention for a wide variety
of natural scenes containing large bodies of water with different lighting and
water surface conditions. Since our method provides a 3D representation of the

supports interactive applications like adding synthetic objects to the scene.

detected <1 day after explosion. The SN rises to a blue and short-lived (2
days) initial peak. Early spectral observations of SN 2022oqm show a hot
(40,000 K) continuum with high-ionization C and O absorption features at
velocities of 4,000 km s$^{-1}$, while its photospheric radius expands at
20,000 km s$^{-1}$, indicating a pre-existing distribution of expanding C/O
material, likely ejected around 2 weeks before the explosion. After around 2.5
days, both the spectrum and light curves evolve into those of a typical SN Ic,
with line velocities of 10,000 km s$^{-1}$, in agreement with the photospheric
radius evolution. The optical light curves reach a second peak around t ~15
days. By t=60 days, the spectrum of SN 2022oqm becomes nearly nebular,
displaying strong C II and [Ca II] emission with no detectable [O I] and
marking this event as Ca-rich. The early behavior can be explained by $10^{-3}$
solar mass of optically thin circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding either
(1) a massive compact progenitor such as a Wolf-Rayet star, (2) a massive
stripped progenitor with an extended envelope, or (3) a binary system with a
white dwarf. We propose that the early-time light curve is powered by a
combination of interaction of the ejecta with the optically thin CSM and shock
cooling (in the massive-star scenario), until the radioactive decay of
$^{56}$Ni becomes the dominant power source. The observations can be explained
by CSM that is optically thick to X-ray photons which are down converted, is
optically thick in the lines as seen in the spectra, and is optically thin to
visible-light continuum photons that come either from down-converted X-rays or
from the shock-heated ejecta. Calculations show that this scenario is
self-consistent.

characteristics of the ACTG 175 HIV trial are significantly different from that
of the three external target populations of interest: US early-stage HIV
patients, Thailand HIV patients, and southern Ethiopia HIV patients. This paper
considers several methods to transport the treatment effect from the ACTG 175
HIV trial to the target populations beyond the trial population. Most transport
methods focus on continuous and binary outcomes; on the contrary, we derive and
discuss several transport methods for survival outcomes: an outcome regression
method based on a Cox proportional hazard (PH) model, an inverse probability
weighting method based on the models for treatment assignment, sampling score,
and censoring, and a doubly robust method that combines both methods, called
the augmented calibration weighting (ACW) method. However, as the PH assumption
was found to be incorrect for the ACTG 175 trial, the methods that depend on
the PH assumption may lead to the biased quantification of the treatment
effect. To account for the violation of the PH assumption, we extend the ACW
method with the linear spline-based hazard regression model that does not
require the PH assumption. Applying the aforementioned methods for

of the human perceiving process by applying a backbone network into a given
video as a black-box. In this paper, we propose to model these interactions
with a multi-modal representation network, namely, Actors-Objects-Environment
Interaction Network (AOE-Net). Our AOE-Net consists of two modules, i.e.,
perception-based multi-modal representation (PMR) and boundary-matching module
(BMM). Additionally, we introduce adaptive attention mechanism (AAM) in PMR to
focus only on main actors (or relevant objects) and model the relationships
among them. PMR module represents each video snippet by a visual-linguistic
feature, in which main actors and surrounding environment are represented by
visual information, whereas relevant objects are depicted by linguistic
features through an image-text model. BMM module processes the sequence of
visual-linguistic features as its input and generates action proposals.
Comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation studies on ActivityNet-1.3 and
THUMOS-14 datasets show that our proposed AOE-Net outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods with remarkable performance and generalization for
both TAPG and temporal action detection. To prove the robustness and
effectiveness of AOE-Net, we further conduct an ablation study on egocentric
videos, i.e. EPIC-KITCHENS 100 dataset. Source code is available upon
acceptance.

Golovach, and Thilikos [WG, 2021] introduced this game and proved that it is
PSPACE-hard and co-W[2]-hard parameterized by the number of agents.
  This hardness naturally motivates the structural parameterization of the
problem. The authors proved that it admits an FPT algorithm when parameterized
by the modular width and the number of allowed rounds. However, they left open
the complexity of the problem from the perspective of other structural
parameters. In particular, they explicitly asked whether the problem admits an
FPT or XP-algorithm with respect to the treewidth of the input graph. We answer
this question in the negative and show that Rendezvous is co-NP-hard even for

cybersecurity practitioners and researchers learn and adapt to evolving attacks
and in planning threat mitigation. Researchers have proposed TTP extraction
methods in the literature, however, not all of these proposed methods are

aid cybersecurity researchers and practitioners choose attack technique
extraction methods for monitoring and sharing threat intelligence by comparing
the underlying methods from the TTP extraction studies in the literature.} In
this work, we identify ten existing TTP extraction studies from the literature
and implement five methods from the ten studies. We find two methods, based on
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency(TFIDF) and Latent Semantic Indexing
(LSI), outperform the other three methods with a F1 score of 84\% and 83\%,

Furthermore, oversampling improves the classification performance of TTP

cybersecurity researchers, such as the construction of a benchmark dataset from
a large corpus; and the selection of textual features of TTP. Our work, along

time for edge operations, and $O(1)$ query time for reporting the density

approximation, and improved previous work that maintained a $(1/4 - \epsilon)$
approximation in amortized polylogarithmic update time [BHNT15]. In this paper
we develop a data structure for $(1-\epsilon)$-approximate DSG that improves
the one from [SW20] in two aspects. First, the data structure uses linear space
improving the space bound in [SW20] by a logarithmic factor. Second, the data

set of candidate architectures during NAS is not scalable, approaches are
needed for predicting end-to-end inference latency on mobile devices. Such
predictions are challenging due to hardware heterogeneity, optimizations
applied by ML frameworks, and the diversity of neural architectures. Motivated
by these challenges, in this paper, we first quantitatively assess
characteristics of neural architectures and mobile devices that have
significant effects on inference latency. Based on this assessment, we propose
a latency prediction framework which addresses these challenges by developing
operation-wise latency predictors, under a variety of settings and a number of
hardware devices, with multi-core CPUs and GPUs, achieving high accuracy in
end-to-end latency prediction, as shown by our comprehensive evaluations. To
illustrate that our approach does not require expensive data collection, we
also show that accurate predictions can be achieved on real-world NAs using
only small amounts of profiling data.

With the increase in vaccination rate, normalcy gradually returns, so is the
taxi demand. However, the changes in the spatial-temporal taxi demand pattern
and factors impacting the recovery of this demand after COVID-19 vaccination
started remain unclear. With the multisource time-series data from Chicago,
including pandemic severity, vaccination progress and taxi trip volume, the
recovery pattern of taxi demand is analyzed. The result reveals the taxi trip
volume and average travel distance increased in most community areas in the
city of Chicago after taking the COVID-19 vaccine. Taxi demand recovers
relatively faster in the airport and area near the central downtown than in
other areas in Chicago. Considering the asynchrony of data, the Pearson
coefficient and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) are both applied to investigate the
correlations among different time series. It found that the recovery of taxi
demand is not only related to the pandemic severity but strongly correlated
with vaccination progress. Then, the leading and lagging relationship between
vaccination progress and taxi demand is investigated by Time Lagging
Cross-Correlation method. Taxi demand starts to recover after the first-dose
vaccination period started and before the second-dose vaccination period.
However, it was not until mid-April that the recovery rate of taxi demand
exceeded the growth of the vaccination rate.

To overcome this limitation, we present the first numerical method with a

integrated circuits utilizing ac power for logic cell excitation and clocking,
and flux biasing, e.g., Adiabatic Quantum Flux Parametron (AQFP), Reciprocal
Quantum Logic, superconducting sensor arrays, qubits, etc. We consider
limitations to the integration scale (device number density) imposed by the
critical current of the ac power transmission lines and cross coupling between
the adjacent transformers. The former sets the minimum line width and the
mutual coupling length in the transformer, whereas the latter sets the minimum
spacing between the transformers. Decreasing linewidth of superconducting (Nb)
wires increases kinetic inductance of the transformer's secondary, decreasing
its length and mutual coupling to the primary. This limits the minimum size of
transformers. As a result, there is a minimum linewidth ~100 nm which
determines the maximum achievable scale of integration. Using AQFP circuits as
an example, we calculate dependence of the AQFP number density on linewidth for
various types of transformers and inductors available in the SFQ5ee fabrication
process developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and estimate the maximum circuit
density as a few million AQFPs per cm^2. We propose an advanced fabrication
process for a 10x increase in the density of AQFP and other ac-powered
circuits. In this process, inductors are formed from a patterned bilayer of a
geometrical inductance material (Nb) deposited over a layer of high kinetic
inductance material (e.g., NbN). Individual pattering of the bilayer layers
allows to create stripline inductors in a wide range of inductances, from the
low values typical to Nb striplines to the high values typical for NbN thin
films, and preserve sufficient mutual coupling in stripline transformers with
extremely low crosstalk.

restriction: for a BNN, by evaluating the learning ability on the input

limiting the amount of input information to match its learning ability; 2)
information recovery: due to the information loss in forward propagation, the
output feature information of the network is not enough to support accurate
classification. By selecting some shallow feature maps with richer information,
and fusing them with the final feature maps to recover the feature information.

k\log^2(n/k) \right)$. We also show that verifying whether a given vertex
coloring forms a weak 2-coloring of the input graph requires messages of
$\Omega(n^{1/3}\log^{2/3}n)$ bits, and the same lower bound holds for verifying
whether a subset of nodes forms a maximal independent set or a minimal
dominating set. Interestingly, it turns out that the same class of lower bound
graphs for the distributed sketching model is versatile enough to yield a space
lower bound of $\Omega(n^2)$ bits for verifying symmetry breaking problems such
as weak $2$-coloring in the fully dynamic turnstile model, where the input
arrives as a stream of edges. We also (nearly) settle the space complexity of
the $k$-ECSS problem in the streaming model by extending the work of Kapralov
et al. (FOCS 2017): We prove a communication complexity lower bound for a
direct sum variant of the $\text{UR}_k^{\subset}$ problem and show that this
implies $\Omega(k\,n\log^2(n/k))$ bits of memory for computing a $k$-ECSS.

the untested assumption that the stellar masses had been derived consistently

$\Upsilon_*$, for the optical and infrared data. We briefly discuss the
""intrinsic relations"" and why some of these will at times appear to have had
partial success when applied to data based on similarly inconsistent values of
$\Upsilon_*$. Finally, we reiterate the importance of the $\upsilon$

including bad programming practices and potential defects. However, it is known
that static bug detectors remain underutilized due to various reasons. Recent
advances to incorporate static bug detectors in modern software development
workflows, such as in code review and continuous integration, are shown capable
of better motivating developers to fix the reported warnings on the fly.
Moreover, tracking the static code warnings will benefit many downstream
software engineering tasks, such as learning the fix patterns for automated
program repair and learning which warnings are of more interest, so they can be
prioritized automatically. Hence, precisely tracking the warnings by static bug
detectors is critical to improve the utilization of static bug detectors
further.
  In this paper, we study the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art (SOA)
solution in tracking the warnings by static bug detectors and propose a better
solution based on our analysis of the insufficiencies of the SOA solution. In
particular, we examined over 2000 commits in four large-scale open-source
systems (i.e., JClouds, Kafka, Spring-boot, and Guava) and crafted a dataset of
3,452 static code warnings by two static bug detectors (i.e., Spotbugs and
PMD). We manually uncover the ground-truth evolution status of the static
warnings: persistent, resolved, or newly-introduced. Moreover, upon manual
analysis, we identified the main reasons behind the insufficiencies of the SOA
solution. Finally, we propose a better approach to improving the tracking of
static warnings over software development history. Our evaluation shows that
our proposed approach provides a significant improvement in terms of the

cumulative reward over time. In Chapter 2, inspired by statistical physics, we
develop a novel approach to Reinforcement Learning (RL) that not only learns
optimal policies with enhanced desirable properties but also sheds new light on
maximum entropy RL. In Chapter 3, we tackle the generalization problem in RL

Considering the transfer is affected by domain shifts in DG, we propose a more
inclusive causal graph to describe DG task. Based on this causal graph, CCM
controls the domain factor to cut off excess causal paths and uses the
remaining part to calculate the causal effects of images to labels via the
front-door criterion. Specifically, CCM is composed of three components: (i)
domain-conditioned supervised learning which teaches CCM the correlation
between images and labels, (ii) causal effect learning which helps CCM measure
the true causal effects of images to labels, (iii) contrastive similarity
learning which clusters the features of images that belong to the same class

support teamwork. Yet, open-source cooperation processes in no way protect
project contributors from considerations of trust, power, and influence.
Indeed, achieving the level of trust necessary to contribute to a project and
thus influence its direction is a constant process of change, and developers
take many different routes over many communication channels to achieve it. We
refer to this process of influence-seeking and trust-building as trust
ascendancy.
  This paper describes a methodology for understanding the notion of trust
ascendancy and introduces the capabilities that are needed to localize trust
ascendancy operations happening over open-source projects. Much of the prior
work in understanding trust in open-source software development has focused on
a static view of the problem using different forms of quantity measures.
However, trust ascendancy is not static, but rather adapts to changes in the
open-source ecosystem in response to new input. This paper is the first attempt
to articulate and study these signals from a dynamic view of the problem. In
that respect, we identify related work that may help illuminate research
challenges, implementation tradeoffs, and complementary solutions. Our

popularity can be extremely dynamic due to diverse user content retrieval
behaviors and the low-degree of user multiplexing. It's challenging for the
traditional reactive caching systems to keep up with the dynamic content
popularity patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel Predictive Edge Caching
(PEC) system that predicts the future content popularity using fine-grained
learning models that mine sequential patterns in user content retrieval
behaviors, and opportunistically prefetches contents predicted to be popular in
the near future using idle network bandwidth. Through extensive experiments
driven by real content retrieval traces, we demonstrate that PEC can adapt to
highly dynamic content popularity, and significantly improve cache hit ratio

policy-aware abuse detection, abandoning the unrealistic expectation that
systems can reliably learn which phenomena constitute abuse from inspecting the
data alone. We propose a machine-friendly representation of the policy that
moderators wish to enforce, by breaking it down into a collection of intents

can be used for abuse detection, while providing a rationale for model

visualization practices in projects about marginalized populations. We present
critiques that identify three potential challenges related to the use of

creating homogeneous depictions of marginalized populations, (2) treating
marginalization as an inclusion criteria, and (3) insufficiently
contextualizing datasets about marginalization. Finally, we highlight

catastrophic forgetting, in which a network quickly forgets what was learned in
a previous task. The human brain, however, is able to continually learn new
tasks and accumulate knowledge throughout life. Neuroscience findings suggest
that continual learning success in the human brain is potentially associated
with its modular structure and memory consolidation mechanisms. In this paper
we propose a novel topological regularization that penalizes cycle structure in
a neural network during training using principled theory from persistent
homology and optimal transport. The penalty encourages the network to learn
modular structure during training. The penalization is based on the closed-form
expressions of the Wasserstein distance and barycenter for the topological
features of a 1-skeleton representation for the network. Our topological
continual learning method combines the proposed regularization with a tiny
episodic memory to mitigate forgetting. We demonstrate that our method is
effective in both shallow and deep network architectures for multiple image

However, finite-precision transformers are a weak transformer variant because,

core capability for transformers, we ask whether a minimally more expressive
model that can attend universally can also be characterized in logic. To this
end, we analyze transformers whose forward pass is computed in $\log n$
precision on contexts of length $n$. We prove that any log-precision

experiences delays and thus, packets with time constraints might be dropped
before being successfully transmitted, while at the same time causing the queue
size of the buffer to increase. Towards understanding the trade-off between
reliability and delays that might lead to packet drops due to the
deadline-constrained bursty traffic with retransmissions, a scenario of a
wireless network utilizing a slotted-ALOHA random-access channel is
investigated. The main focus is to reveal and investigate further the trade-off
between the number of retransmissions and the packet deadline as a function of
the arrival rate. Hence, we are able to determine numerically the optimal
probability of transmissions and number of retransmissions, given the packet
arrival rate and the packet deadline. The analysis of the system was done by
means of discrete-time Markov chains. Two scenarios are studied: i) the
collision channel model (in which a receiver can decode only when a single
packet is transmitted), and ii) the case for which receivers have multi-packet
reception capabilities. A performance evaluation for a user with different
transmit probability and number of retransmissions is conducted, demonstrating
their impact on the average drop rate and throughput, while at the same time
showing that there exists a set of values, under which improved performance can

  via Secret Data Sharing","This paper was accepted to NeurIPS 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning (FL) strives to enable collaborative training of machine
learning models without centrally collecting clients' private data. Different
from centralized training, the local datasets across clients in FL are
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). In addition, the
data-owning clients may drop out of the training process arbitrarily. These
characteristics will significantly degrade the training performance. This paper
proposes a Dropout-Resilient Secure Federated Learning (DReS-FL) framework
based on Lagrange coded computing (LCC) to tackle both the non-IID and dropout
problems. The key idea is to utilize Lagrange coding to secretly share the
private datasets among clients so that each client receives an encoded version
of the global dataset, and the local gradient computation over this dataset is
unbiased. To correctly decode the gradient at the server, the gradient function
has to be a polynomial in a finite field, and thus we construct polynomial
integer neural networks (PINNs) to enable our framework. Theoretical analysis
shows that DReS-FL is resilient to client dropouts and provides privacy
protection for the local datasets. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate
that DReS-FL consistently leads to significant performance gains over baseline
methods.

various latitudes and show that the spectral cutoff in these cases can be
explained for a large range of acceptable physical parameters, e.g., a
semi-relativistic plasma with $\gamma \simeq 20$ for high latitudes or a highly
relativistic plasma ($\gamma \simeq 10^5$) for emission close to the electron's
orbital plane in a typical magnetic field of $B\simeq 10^{12} \, \rm G$. We
also discuss how such an emission mechanism can be distinguished from other
proposed models. A corollary to our study is that most ULXs might be neutron

categorize and predict various academic research journals. This work suggests a
hybrid predictive model comprising of five steps. The first step is to prepare
the dataset with twenty features. The second step is to pre-process the
dataset. The third step is to apply an appropriate clustering algorithm for
categorization. The fourth step is to apply appropriate feature selection
techniques to get an effective subset of features. The fifth step involves some
ensemble plus non ensemble methods to train the model. The model is trained on
a full set of features, and a selected subset of features is obtained by
applying three feature selection techniques. After model training, the

(MEC) of the mammalian brain forms a vector representation of the self-position
of the animal. Recurrent neural networks have been proposed to explain the
properties of the grid cells by updating the neural activity vector based on
the velocity input of the animal. In doing so, the grid cell system effectively
performs path integration. In this paper, we investigate the algebraic,
geometric, and topological properties of grid cells using recurrent network
models. Algebraically, we study the Lie group and Lie algebra of the recurrent
transformation as a representation of self-motion. Geometrically, we study the
conformal isometry of the Lie group representation where the local displacement
of the activity vector in the neural space is proportional to the local
displacement of the agent in the 2D physical space. Topologically, the compact
abelian Lie group representation automatically leads to the torus topology
commonly assumed and observed in neuroscience. We then focus on a simple
non-linear recurrent model that underlies the continuous attractor neural
networks of grid cells. Our numerical experiments show that conformal isometry
leads to hexagon periodic patterns in the grid cell responses and our model is
capable of accurate path integration. Code is available at

generation without human efforts. The generated labels can train grasp network
that performs robustly in the real evaluation scene (the Sim2Real step). In
synthetic and real experiments, we show that the Real2Sim2Real pipeline

results. To overcome this, inspired by recent success of implicit neural
representation, we present a novel method for semantic correspondence, called
Neural Matching Field (NeMF). However, complicacy and high-dimensionality of a
4D matching field are the major hindrances, which we propose a cost embedding
network to process a coarse cost volume to use as a guidance for establishing
high-precision matching field through the following fully-connected network.
Nevertheless, learning a high-dimensional matching field remains challenging
mainly due to computational complexity, since a naive exhaustive inference
would require querying from all pixels in the 4D space to infer pixel-wise
correspondences. To overcome this, we propose adequate training and inference
procedures, which in the training phase, we randomly sample matching candidates
and in the inference phase, we iteratively performs PatchMatch-based inference
and coordinate optimization at test time. With these combined, competitive
results are attained on several standard benchmarks for semantic

spatial transformer. It forces the network to focus on modelling correlations

vital important to make temporal transformer work. Extensive experimental

ansatz for the Green's function of the high-frequency Helmholtz equation in

discretization cells, the proposed algorithm first solves and tabulates the
phase and HB coefficients via eikonal and transport equations with observation
points and point sources located at the Chebyshev nodes using a set of much
coarser computation grids, and then butterfly compresses the resulting HB
interactions from all $N_v$ cell centers to each other. The overall CPU time
and memory requirement scale as $O(N_v\log^2N_v)$ for any bounded 2D domains
with arbitrary excitation sources. A direct extension of this scheme to bounded
3D domains yields an $O(N_v^{4/3})$ CPU complexity, which can be further
reduced to quasi-linear complexities with proposed remedies. The scheme can
also efficiently handle scattering problems involving inclusions in
inhomogeneous media. Although the current construction of our HB integrator
does not accommodate caustics, the resulting HB integrator itself can be
applied to certain sources, such as concave-shaped sources, to produce caustic
effects. Compared to finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) methods, the
proposed HB integrator is free of numerical dispersion and requires fewer
discretization points per wavelength. As a result, it can solve
wave-propagation problems well beyond the capability of existing solvers.
Remarkably, the proposed scheme can accurately model wave propagation in 2D
domains with 640 wavelengths per direction and in 3D domains with 54

observers for linear systems based on the pairwise observer structure. A
minimal-order appointed-time observer is first proposed for the linear system
without the unknown input, which can estimate the state exactly at the preset
time by seeking for the unique solution of a system of linear equations. To
further release the computational burden, another form of the appointed-time
observer is designed. For the general linear system with the unknown input
acting on both the system dynamics and the measured output, the model
reconfiguration is made to decouple the effect of the unknown input, and the
gap between the existing reduced-order appointed-time unknown input observer
and the possible minimal-order appointed-time observer is revealed. Based on
the reconstructed model, the minimal-order appointed-time unknown input
observer is presented to realize state estimation of linear system with the
unknown input at the arbitrarily small preset time. The minimal-order
appointed-time unknown input observer is then applied to the design of fully
distributed adaptive output-feedback attack-free consensus protocols for linear
multi-agent systems.

aims to fail the learner on a particular target test point $x$ which is known
to the adversary but not to the learner. In this work we aim to characterize
the smallest achievable error $\epsilon=\epsilon(\eta)$ by the learner in the
presence of such an adversary in both realizable and agnostic settings. We
fully achieve this in the realizable setting, proving that
$\epsilon=\Theta(\mathtt{VC}(\mathcal{H})\cdot \eta)$, where
$\mathtt{VC}(\mathcal{H})$ is the VC dimension of $\mathcal{H}$. Remarkably, we
show that the upper bound can be attained by a deterministic learner. In the
agnostic setting we reveal a more elaborate landscape: we devise a
deterministic learner with a multiplicative regret guarantee of $\epsilon \leq
C\cdot\mathtt{OPT} + O(\mathtt{VC}(\mathcal{H})\cdot \eta)$, where $C > 1$ is a
universal numerical constant. We complement this by showing that for any
deterministic learner there is an attack which worsens its error to at least
$2\cdot \mathtt{OPT}$. This implies that a multiplicative deterioration in the
regret is unavoidable in this case. Finally, the algorithms we develop for
achieving the optimal rates are inherently improper. Nevertheless, we show that
for a variety of natural concept classes, such as linear classifiers, it is
possible to retain the dependence $\epsilon=\Theta_{\mathcal{H}}(\eta)$ by a
proper algorithm in the realizable setting. Here $\Theta_{\mathcal{H}}$
conceals a polynomial dependence on $\mathtt{VC}(\mathcal{H})$.

this channel modeling method can be applied to various transmission

reconstructed volumetrically. By refocusing the fields to the sample planes,
absorption and phase-shift profiles of sparsely distributed samples can be
simultaneously inferred in 3D. This holographic advantage is highly useful for
spectroscopic imaging of cold atomic samples. However, unlike (e.g., biological
samples or solid particles), the quasi-thermal atomic gases under laser-cooling
are typically featureless without sharp boundaries, invalidating a class of
standard numerical refocusing methods. Here, we extend the refocusing protocol
based on the Gouy phase anomaly for small phase objects to free atomic samples.
With a prior knowledge on a coherent spectral phase angle relation for cold
atoms that is robust against probe condition variations, an ``out-of-phase''
response of the atomic sample can be reliably identified, which flips the sign
during the numeric back-propagation across the sample plane to serve as the
refocus criterion. Experimentally, we determine the sample plane of a

Number Theory in terms of Lagrange's Four-Square Theorem and related results.
This leads to a solution to the open problem by using Lagrange's Four-Square

zero-factor (ZF) approach to solve a series of gradient flow problems. The
numerical schemes based on the new algorithm are unconditionally energy stable
with the original energy and do not require any extra assumption conditions. We
also prove that the ZF schemes with specific zero factors lead to the popular
SAV-type method. To reduce the computation cost and improve the accuracy and
consistency, we propose a zero-factor approach with relaxation, which we named
the relaxed zero-factor (RZF) method, to design unconditional energy stable

energy stable with respect to a modified energy that is closer to the original
energy, and provide a very simple calculation process. The variation of the
introduced zero factor is highly consistent with the nonlinear free energy

the sharp dissipation of nonlinear free energy. Several numerical examples are

paper is to maximize the minimum beampattern gain by jointly optimizing active
beamforming, power allocation coefficients and passive beamforming. To tackle
the non-convexity of the formulated optimization problem, the beampattern gain
and constraints are first transformed into more tractable forms. Then, an
iterative block coordinate descent (IBCD) algorithm is proposed by employing
successive convex approximation (SCA), Schur complement, semidefinite
relaxation (SDR) and sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SRCR) methods.
To reduce the complexity of the proposed IBCD algorithm, a low-complexity
iterative alternating optimization (IAO) algorithm is proposed. Particularly,
the active beamforming is optimized by solving a semidefinite programming (SDP)
problem and the closed-form solutions of the power allocation coefficients are
derived. Numerical results show that: i) the proposed RIS-NOMA-ISAC system
always outperforms the RIS-ISAC system without NOMA in beampattern gain and
illumination power; ii) the low-complexity IAO algorithm achieves a comparable
performance to that achieved by the IBCD algorithm. iii) high beampattern gain

with the support of some indices defined for Doppler fetal waveforms. Although
this approach has demonstrated to be satisfactory in the most of the cases, it
can be largely improved with the aid of more advanced techniques, i.e.
numerical analysis and simulation. Another key aspect limiting the analysis is
that clinicians rely on a limited number of Doppler waveforms observed during
the clinical examination. Moreover, the use of simple velocimetric indicators
for deriving possible malfunctions of the fetal cardiovascular system can be
misleading, being the fetal assessment based on a mere statistical analysis
(comparison with physiological ranges), without any deep physio-pathological
interpretations of the observed hemodynamic changes. The use of a lumped
mathematical model, properly describing the entire fetal cardiovascular system,
would be absolutely helpful in this context: by targeting physiological model
parameters on the clinical reliefs, we could gain deep insights of the full
system. The calibration of model parameters may also help in formulating
patient-specific early diagnosis of fetal pathologies. In the present work, we
develop a robust parameter estimation algorithm based on two different
optimization methods using synthetic data. In particular, we deal with the
inverse problem of recognizing the most significant parameters of a lumped
fetal circulation model by using time tracings of fetal blood flows and
pressures obtained by the model. This represents a first methodological work

Despite a lot of methods being proposed for traffic forecasting, it is still

includes short-term dependency and long-term dependency, and the latter is
often overlooked. Spatial dependency can be divided into two parts:
distance-based spatial dependency and hidden spatial dependency. To model
complex spatial-temporal dependency, we propose a novel framework for traffic
forecasting, named Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Gated Recurrent Network

mining periodic information in traffic data. We propose a Double Graph

integrates graph convolutional network and GRU. The graph convolution part
models distance-based spatial dependency with the distance-based predefined
adjacency matrix and hidden spatial dependency with the self-adaptive adjacency
matrix, respectively. Specially, we employ the multi-head mechanism to capture
multiple hidden dependencies. In addition, the periodic pattern of each
prediction node may be different, which is often ignored, resulting in mutual
interference of periodic information among nodes when modeling spatial
dependency. For this, we explore the architecture of model and improve the
performance. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superior performance

cometary nuclei composition has experienced a great advancement. The properties
of 67P/CG nucleus are discussed and compared with other comets explored in the
past by space missions. Cometary nuclei are made by a collection of ices,
minerals, organic matter, and salts resulting in very dark and red-colored
surfaces. When far from the Sun, exposed water and carbon dioxide ices are
found only in few locations of 67P/CG where the exposure of pristine subsurface
layers or the recondensation of volatile species driven by the solar heating
and local terrain morphology can sustain their temporary presence on the
surface. The nucleus surface appears covered by a dust layer of variable
thickness. Dust grains appear mostly dehydrated and are made by an assemblage
of minerals, organic matter, and salts. Spectral analysis shows that the
mineral phase is dominated by silicates, fine-grained opaques and ammoniated
salts. Aliphatic and aromatic groups, with the presence of the strong hydroxyl
group, are identified within the organic matter. The surface composition of
cometary nuclei evolves with heliocentric distance and seasonal cycling:
approaching perihelion the increase of the solar flux boosts the activity
through the sublimation of volatiles which in turn causes the erosion of
surface layers, the exposure of ices, the activity in cliffs and pits, the
collapse of overhangs and walls, and the mobilization and redistribution of
dust. The evolution of color, composition, and texture changes occurring across
different morphological regions of the nucleus are correlated with these
processes. In this chapter we discuss 67P/CG nucleus composition and
evolutionary processes as observed by Rosetta mission in the context of other
comets previously explored by space missions or observed from Earth.

arising in embedded systems that require highly optimized hardware. An
efficient way is to replace costly generic multiplication by bit-shifts and

state-of-the-art optimal approach for MCM, based on Integer Linear Programming
(ILP). We introduce a new lower-level hardware cost, based on counting the
number of one-bit adders and demonstrate that it is strongly correlated with
the LUT count. This new model for the multiplierless MCM circuits permitted us
to consider intermediate truncations that permit to significantly save
resources when a full output precision is not required. We incorporate the
error propagation rules into our ILP model to guarantee a user-given error
bound on the MCM results. The proposed ILP models for multiple flavors of MCM
are implemented as an open-source tool and, combined with the FloPoCo code
generator, provide a complete coefficient-to-VHDL flow. We evaluate our models
in extensive experiments, and propose an in-depth analysis of the impact that
design metrics have on actually synthesized hardware.

these notions in the context of qubit channels. The Bell-CHSH inequality has a
greater perspective--compared to any genuine tripartite nonlocality
scenario--while determining the interplay between nonlocality breaking qubit
channels and incompatibility breaking qubit channels. In the Bell-CHSH
scenario, we prove that if the conjugate of a channel is incompatibility
breaking, then the channel is itself nonlocality breaking and vice versa.
However, this equivalence is not straightforwardly generalized to multipartite
systems, due to the absence of an equivalence relation between incompatibility
and nonlocality in the multipartite scenario. We investigate this relation in
the tripartite scenario by considering some well-known states like
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and $W$ states and using the notion of Mermin and
Svetlichny nonlocality. By subjecting the parties in question to unital qubit
channels, we identify the range of state and channel parameters for which
incompatibility coexists with nonlocality. Further, we identify the set of
unital qubit channels that is Mermin or Svetlichny nonlocality breaking
irrespective of the input state.

Interestingly, we find that employing FM with diffusion paths results in a more
robust and stable alternative for training diffusion models. Furthermore, Flow
Matching opens the door to training CNFs with other, non-diffusion probability
paths. An instance of particular interest is using Optimal Transport (OT)
displacement interpolation to define the conditional probability paths. These
paths are more efficient than diffusion paths, provide faster training and
sampling, and result in better generalization. Training CNFs using Flow
Matching on ImageNet leads to consistently better performance than alternative
diffusion-based methods in terms of both likelihood and sample quality, and
allows fast and reliable sample generation using off-the-shelf numerical ODE

propose to describe the concept of community as a 'vague operator', a variant
of Susan Leigh Star's notion of the boundary object, and propose that the
ability to construct different modes of description that are both vague in some
registers and hyper-precise in others, is core both to digital politics and the
analysis of 'communities'. Engaging with these formations in terms drawn from

Disentangling different lineages in network science then allows us to
contextualise the founding account of 'community' popularised by Michelle

detection algorithm, the widely-used 'Louvain algorithm', we comment on
controversies arising with some of their more ambiguous applications. We argue
that 'community' can act as a real abstraction with the power to reshape social
relations such as producing echo chambers in social networking sites. To rework
the epistemological terms of community detection and propose a reconsideration
of vague operators, we draw on debates and propositions within the literature
of network science to imagine a 'critical heuristics' that embraces partiality,
epistemic humbleness, reflexivity and artificiality.

approximated surface by searching for the moving target of queries in a dynamic
way, which results in a consistent field around the surface. Meanwhile, we

set of images. Appropriately including visual variation and contextual
information captured inside the input images is one of the most challenging
aspects of visual storytelling. Consequently, stories developed from a set of
images often lack cohesiveness, relevance, and semantic relationship. In this
paper, we propose a novel Vision Transformer Based Model for describing a set
of images as a story. The proposed method extracts the distinct features of the
input images using a Vision Transformer (ViT). Firstly, input images are
divided into 16X16 patches and bundled into a linear projection of flattened
patches. The transformation from a single image to multiple image patches
captures the visual variety of the input visual patterns. These features are
used as input to a Bidirectional-LSTM which is part of the sequence encoder.
This captures the past and future image context of all image patches. Then, an
attention mechanism is implemented and used to increase the discriminatory
capacity of the data fed into the language model, i.e. a Mogrifier-LSTM. The
performance of our proposed model is evaluated using the Visual Story-Telling
dataset (VIST), and the results show that our model outperforms the current
state of the art models.

Various numerical methods have been proposed to solve this problem, among which
the Gradient Descent (GD) method is the most popular one due to its simplicity

minima and the slow convergence especially near the minima point. The Natural
Gradient Descent(NGD), which has been proved as one of the most powerful method

accelerate the convergence. Here, we give a unified method to extend the NGD

time-delay measurements of six strong lensing systems and 120
intermediate-luminosity quasars calibrated as standard rulers) could break the
degeneracy between cosmological parameters ($H_0$, $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_k$)

model-independent estimations of the Hubble constant $H_0$, which is strongly
consistent with that derived from the local distance ladder by SH0ES

a DGP cosmology (especially for the flat universe), the measured Hubble
constant is in good agreement with that derived from the the recent Planck 2018

by the current lensed and unlensed quasar observations and there is no
significant deviation from a flat universe. For most of cosmological model we
study (the flat $\Lambda$CDM, non-flat $\Lambda$CDM, flat PEDE, and non-flat

with $\Omega_m\sim 0.30$ in all the data sets, as expected by the latest
cosmological observations. Finally, according to the the statistical criteria
DIC, although the joint constraints provide substantial observational support
to the flat PEDE model, they do not rule out dark energy being a cosmological

supervised signals for many downstream tasks such as named entity tagging. To
reduce the human effort of writing rules, previous researchers adopt an
iterative approach to automatically learn logical rules from several seed
rules. However, obtaining more seed rules can only be accomplished by extra
human annotation with heavy costs. Limited by the size and quality of the seed
rules, the model performance of previous systems is bounded. In this paper, we
develop a novel framework STREAM to distill task-specific logical rules from
large pre-trained models. Specifically, we borrow recent prompt-based language
models as the knowledge expert to yield initial seed rules, and based on the
formed high-quality instance pool that acts as an intermediary role, we keep
teaching the expert to fit our task and learning task-specific logical rules.
Experiments on three public named entity tagging benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed framework. With several predefined prompt
templates, our system has gained significant improvements over previous

prerequisite to language understanding. While contextualised language models

human-level accuracy, we argue that such results have been inflated because of
the high similarity between training and test concepts. This means that models
which capture concept similarity can perform well, even if they do not capture
any knowledge of the commonsense properties themselves. In settings where there
is no overlap between the properties that are considered during training and
testing, we find that the empirical performance of standard language models
drops dramatically. To address this, we study the possibility of fine-tuning
language models to explicitly model concepts and their properties. In
particular, we train separate concept and property encoders on two types of
readily available data: extracted hyponym-hypernym pairs and generic sentences.
Our experimental results show that the resulting encoders allow us to predict
commonsense properties with much higher accuracy than is possible by directly
fine-tuning language models. We also present experimental results for the
related task of unsupervised hypernym discovery.

graph to produce an infinite play, which determines the winner of the game.
\emph{Bidding games} are graph games in which in each turn, an auction
(bidding) determines which player moves the token: the players have budgets,
and in each turn, both players simultaneously submit bids that do not exceed
their available budgets, the higher bidder moves the token, and pays the bid to
the lower bidder. We distinguish between {\em continuous}- and {\em
discrete}-bidding games. In the latter, the granularity of the players' bids is
restricted, e.g., bids must be given in cents. Continuous-bidding games are
well understood, however, from a practical standpoint, discrete-bidding games
are more appealing.
  In this paper we focus on discrete-bidding games. We study the problem of
finding {\em threshold budgets}; namely, a necessary and sufficient initial
budget for winning the game. Previously, the properties of threshold budgets
were only studied for reachability games. For parity discrete-bidding games,
thresholds were known to exist, but their structure was not understood. We
describe two algorithms for finding threshold budgets in parity
discrete-bidding games. The first algorithm is a fixed-point algorithm, and it
reveals the structure of the threshold budgets in these games. Second, we show
that the problem of finding threshold budgets is in \NP and co\NP for parity
discrete-bidding games. Previously, only exponential-time algorithms where
known for reachability and parity objectives. A corollary of this proof is a
construction of strategies that use polynomial-size memory.

For each patient, an effective speed of sound, as well as a phase aberration
profile, were determined in several isoplanatic patches spread across the
image. This information was then used in the beamforming process. It improved
image quality both for ultrafast Doppler imaging and Ultrasound Localization
Microscopy (ULM), especially in cases of thick bone windows. For ultrafast
Doppler images, the contrast was increased by 4dB on average, and for ULM, the
number of detected microbubble tracks was increased by 38%. This technique is
thus promising for better diagnosis and follow-up of brain pathologies such as

solar surface signatures of the origins of CMEs and then focuses on the
attempts to understand the kinematic evolution of CMEs from the Sun to the
Earth. CMEs have been observed in the solar corona in white-light from a series
of space missions over the last five decades. In particular, LASCO/SOHO has
provided almost continuous coverage of CMEs for more than two solar cycles
until today. However, the observations from LASCO suffered from projection
effects and limited field of view (within 30 Rs from the Sun). The launch in
2006 of the twin STEREO spacecraft made possible multiple viewpoints imaging
observations, which enabled us to assess the projection effects on CMEs.
Moreover, heliospheric imagers (HIs) onboard STEREO continuously observed the
large and unexplored distance gap between the Sun and Earth. Finally, the
Earth-directed CMEs that before have been routinely identified only near the
Earth at 1 AU in in situ observations from ACE and WIND, could also be
identified at longitudes away from the Sun-Earth line using the in situ
instruments onboard STEREO. Our review presents the frequently used methods for
estimation of the kinematics of CMEs and their arrival time at 1 AU using
primarily SOHO and STEREO observations. We emphasize the need of deriving the
three-dimensional (3D) properties of Earth-directed CMEs from the locations
away from the Sun-Earth line. The results improving the CME arrival time
prediction at Earth and the open issues holding back progress are also
discussed. Finally, we summarize the importance of heliospheric imaging and
discuss the path forward to achieve improved space weather forecasting.

underlying causes of the replication crisis in several fields. Recently, the
introduction of multiverse analysis provides researchers with a method to
evaluate the stability of the results across reasonable choices that could be
made when analyzing data. Multiverse analysis is confined to a descriptive
role, lacking a proper and comprehensive inferential procedure. Recently,
specification curve analysis adds an inferential procedure to multiverse
analysis, but this approach is limited to simple cases related to the linear

rejects the null hypothesis, but not which specifications should be selected.

accounts for all possible models, i.e., the multiverse of reasonable analyses.
The approach allows for a wide range of data specifications (i.e.
pre-processing) and any generalized linear model; it allows testing the null
hypothesis of a given predictor not being associated with the outcome, by
merging information from all reasonable models of multiverse analysis, and
provides strong control of the family-wise error rate such that it allows
researchers to claim that the null-hypothesis can be rejected for each

small amounts of data. One of the most popular and elegant Few-Shot learning
approaches is Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). The main idea behind this
method is to learn shared universal weights of a meta-model, which then are
adapted for specific tasks. However, due to limited data size, the method
suffers from over-fitting and poorly quantifies uncertainty. Bayesian
approaches could, in principle, alleviate these shortcomings by learning weight
distributions in place of point-wise weights. Unfortunately, previous Bayesian
modifications of MAML are limited in a way similar to the classic MAML, e.g.,
task-specific adaptations must share the same structure and can not diverge
much from the universal meta-model. Additionally, task-specific distributions
are considered as posteriors to the universal distributions working as priors,
and optimizing them jointly with gradients is hard and poses a risk of getting
stuck in local optima.
  In this paper, we propose BayesianHyperShot, a novel generalization of
Bayesian MAML, which employs Bayesian principles along with Hypernetworks for
MAML. We achieve better convergence than the previous methods by classically
learning universal weights. Furthermore, Bayesian treatment of the specific
tasks enables uncertainty quantification, and high flexibility of task
adaptations is achieved using Hypernetworks instead of gradient-based updates.
Consequently, the proposed approach not only improves over the previous
methods, both classic and Bayesian MAML in several standard Few-Shot learning
benchmarks but also benefits from the properties of the Bayesian framework.

considerable attention from scientists and climate policy makers. However,
recent work indicates that the changing variability, that is, the amplitude and
the temporal autocorrelation of deviations from the mean, may have greater and
more imminent impact on ecosystems.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that changes in climate variability alone could
drive cyclic predator-prey ecosystems to extinction via so-called phase tipping
(P-tipping), a new type of instability that occurs only from certain phases of
the predator-prey cycle. We construct a mathematical model of a variable
climate and couple it to two self-oscillating paradigmatic predator-prey
models. Most importantly, we combine realistic parameter values for the Canada

way, we demonstrate that critically important species in the boreal forest have
increased likelihood of P-tipping to extinction under predicted changes in
climate variability, and are most vulnerable during stages of the cycle when
the predator population is near its maximum. Furthermore, our analysis reveals
that stochastic resonance is the underlying mechanism for the increased

augmentation is not ideal as it requires a careful selection of the type of
augmentations to perform, which in turn can affect the geometric and semantic
information learned by the network during self-training. To overcome this
issue, we propose an augmentation-free unsupervised approach for point clouds
to learn transferable point-level features via soft clustering, named SoftClu.
SoftClu assumes that the points belonging to a cluster should be close to each
other in both geometric and feature spaces. This differs from typical
contrastive learning, which builds similar representations for a whole point
cloud and its augmented versions. We exploit the affiliation of points to their
clusters as a proxy to enable self-training through a pseudo-label prediction
task. Under the constraint that these pseudo-labels induce the equipartition of
the point cloud, we cast SoftClu as an optimal transport problem. We formulate
an unsupervised loss to minimize the standard cross-entropy between
pseudo-labels and predicted labels. Experiments on downstream applications,

and MSD, which both provide access to the mobility kernel. With increasing
concentration, however, MSD and recoil show distinct behaviors, rooted in
different behaviors of the two kernels. Using two theoretical models, a linear
two-bath particle model and hard spheres treated by mode-coupling theory, we
find a Volterra relation between the two kernels, explaining differing
timescales in friction and mobility kernels under variation of concentration.

the current evaluation metrics are adopted from the question answering (QA).
However, the application of QA-based metrics is extremely time-consuming in

be severely prolonged. In this paper, we propose a new method called ClozE to
evaluate factual consistency by cloze model, instantiated based on masked
language model(MLM), with strong interpretability and substantially higher
speed. We demonstrate that ClozE can reduce the evaluation time by nearly
96$\%$ relative to QA-based metrics while retaining their interpretability and
performance through experiments on six human-annotated datasets and a
meta-evaluation benchmark GO FIGURE \citep{gabriel2020go}. We also implement
experiments to further demonstrate more characteristics of ClozE in terms of
performance and speed. In addition, we conduct an experimental analysis of the
limitations of ClozE, which suggests future research directions. The code and

across languages and cultures. Much research to improve on multilingual
ontologies has taken place in the meantime, and presumably multilingual linked
data could use multilingual ontologies. Therefore, this review seeks to (i)
elucidate and compare the modelling options for multilingual ontologies, (ii)
examine extant ontologies for their multilingualism, and (iii) evaluate
ontology editors for their ability to manage a multilingual ontology. Nine
different principal approaches for modelling multilinguality in ontologies were
identified, which fall into either of the following approaches: using
multilingual labels, linguistic models, or a mapping-based approach. They are
compared on design by means of an ad hoc visualisation mode of modelling
multilingual information for ontologies, shortcomings, and what issues they aim
to solve. For the ontologies, we extracted production-level and accessible
ontologies from BioPortal and the LOV repositories, which had, at best, 6.77%
and 15.74% multilingual ontologies, respectively, where most of them have only
partial translations and they all use a labels-based approach only. Based on a
set of nine tool requirements for managing multilingual ontologies, the
assessment of seven relevant ontology editors showed that there are significant
gaps in tooling support, with VocBench 3 nearest of meeting them all. This

applicability to low-compute networks has received limited attention. Reported
performance has trailed behind standard supervised pre-training by a large
margin, barring self-supervised learning from making an impact on models that
are deployed on device. Most prior works attribute this poor performance to the
capacity bottleneck of the low-compute networks and opt to bypass the problem
through the use of knowledge distillation (KD). In this work, we revisit SSL
for efficient neural networks, taking a closer at what are the detrimental
factors causing the practical limitations, and whether they are intrinsic to
the self-supervised low-compute setting. We find that, contrary to accepted
knowledge, there is no intrinsic architectural bottleneck, we diagnose that the
performance bottleneck is related to the model complexity vs regularization
strength trade-off. In particular, we start by empirically observing that the
use of local views can have a dramatic impact on the effectiveness of the SSL
methods. This hints at view sampling being one of the performance bottlenecks
for SSL on low-capacity networks. We hypothesize that the view sampling
strategy for large neural networks, which requires matching views in very
diverse spatial scales and contexts, is too demanding for low-capacity
architectures. We systematize the design of the view sampling mechanism,
leading to a new training methodology that consistently improves the
performance across different SSL methods (e.g. MoCo-v2, SwAV, DINO), different
low-size networks (e.g. MobileNetV2, ResNet18, ResNet34, ViT-Ti), and different

physical interaction, which describes how the electrons' spin couples to their
orbital motion. It is the source of a vast variety of fascinating phenomena in
solids such as topological phases of matter, quantum spin Hall states, and many
other exotic quantum states. Although in most theoretical descriptions of the
phenomenon of high-temperature superconductivity SOC has been neglected,
including this interaction can, in principle, revise the microscopic picture of
superconductivity in these compounds. Not only the interaction leading to
Cooper pairing but also the symmetry of the order parameter and the topological
character of the involved states can be determined by SOC. Here by preforming
energy-, momentum-, and spin-resolved spectroscopy experiments with an
unprecedented resolution we demonstrate that while probing the dynamic charge
response of the FeSe monolayer on strontium titanate, a prototype two
dimensional high-temperature superconductor using slow electrons, the
scattering cross-section shows a considerable spin asymmetry. We unravel the
origin of the observed spin asymmetry by developing a model in which SOC is
taken into consideration. Our analysis indicates that SOC in this two
dimensional superconductor is rather strong. We anticipate that such a strong
SOC can have several serious consequences on the electronic structures and can
lead to the formation of topological states. Moreover, a sizable SOC can
compete with other pairing scenarios and is crucial for the mechanism of
high-temperature superconductivity.

confirm that the SNe+QSOs constraints in both flat and non-flat PAge cases are
in remarkable tension with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Next, we
investigate the tension from the perspective of redshift-evolution effects. We
find that the QSO correlation coefficient $\gamma$ calibrated by SNe+low-z QSOs

star-forming galaxies to extreme systems such as clouds forming super-star
clusters, where radiation pressure is expected to be the dominant feedback
mechanism. We find that star formation can only be regulated by radiation
pressure for $\Sigma \lesssim 10^3 \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \, \mathrm{pc}^{-2}$,
but that clouds with $\Sigma \lesssim 10^5 \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \,
\mathrm{pc}^{-2}$ become super-Eddington once high star formation efficiencies
($\sim 80 \%$) are reached, and therefore launch the remaining gas in a steady
outflow. These outflows achieve mass-weighted radial velocities of $\sim 15$ -
$30 \,\mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is $\sim 0.5$ - $2.0$ times the
cloud escape speed. This suggests that radiation pressure is a strong candidate
to explain recently observed molecular outflows found in young super-star
clusters in nearby starburst galaxies. We quantify the relative importance of
UV and IR radiation pressure in different regimes, and deduce that both are
equally important for $\Sigma \sim 10^3 \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \,
\mathrm{pc}^{-2}$, whereas clouds with higher (lower) density are increasingly
dominated by the IR (UV) component. Comparison with control runs without either
the UV or IR bands suggests that the outflows are primarily driven by the
impulse provided by the UV component, while IR radiation has the effect of
rendering a larger fraction of gas super-Eddington, and thereby increasing the
outflow mass flux by a factor of $\sim 2$.

accompanied by blue-/red-shifted absorption. Notably, disappearance of dark
filaments leads to the apparent enhancement of the H$\alpha$ line center
emission. (iii) Eruptions of off limb prominences show blue-/red-shifted
emission. These spectral features enable us to identify the active phenomena on
Sun-like stars. We have also found that even the filament eruptions showing
red-shifted absorptions in Sun-as-a-star H$\alpha$ spectra lead to coronal mass
ejections (CMEs). This result suggests that even if the falling components of
stellar filament eruptions are detected as red-shifted absorptions in H$\alpha$
spectra, such stellar filament eruptions may also develop into CMEs.

for solving certain classical combinatorial optimization problems on near-term

quantum cost exhibits an easy-hard-easy or easy-hard pattern respectively as
the clause density is changed. The quantum resources needed in the hard-region
problems are out of reach for current NISQ devices. We show by numerical
simulations with up to 14 variables and analytical arguments that the
adaptive-bias QAOA (ab-QAOA) greatly improves performance in the hard region of
the 3-SAT problems and hard region of the Max-3-SAT problems. For similar
accuracy, on average, ab-QAOA needs 3 levels for 10-variable 3-SAT problems as
compared to 22 for QAOA. For 10-variable Max-3-SAT problems, the numbers are 7

classical optimization is not strictly necessary in the ab-QAOA since local

optimization-free ab-QAOA that can solve the hard-region 3-SAT and Max-3-SAT

for the gravitational component, we find that the [OIII] velocity dispersion
normalized by stellar mass also increases with both X-ray luminosity and radio

luminous AGNs. Therefore, we find no clear preference between X-ray luminosity

there is no evidence that our obscured AGNs are preferentially associated with
higher velocity outflows. Finally, we find a turning point around

universe is unknown, which is commonly referred to as the ``missing baryon
problem"". It is theorized that at least half of these missing baryons are in a
warm-hot, low-density phase outside of the virialized dark-matter halos.
  Aims. We make an attempt to find the signature of this warm-hot intergalactic
medium (WHIM) phase in the filaments of the nearby Virgo cluster by using
optical and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect data.
  Methods. Specifically, we use a filament-galaxy catalog created from the
HyperLeda database and an all-sky Compton-y map extracted from the Planck
satellite data for 2-dimensional cross-correlation analysis by applying
spherical harmonics transform. Significance test is based on the null-test
simulations which exploits advanced cut-sky analysis tools for a proper map
reconstruction. To place upper limits on the WHIM density in the Virgo
filaments, realistic baryonic density modelling within the cosmic filaments is
done based on state-of-the-art hydro-simulations, and it's done within the
signal-boosting routine.
  Results. The cross-correlation signal is found to be too dim compared to the
noise level in the Planck y-map. At 3$\sigma$ confidence level, the upper limit
on volume-average WHIM density turns out to be $\left\langle n_e \right\rangle
\lt 4\times10^{-4} cm^{-3}$, which is indeed consistent with the WHIM parameter
space as predicted from simulations.

However, existing literature does not consider the aspect of dynamic control
over the voltage stiffness of a VOC. Voltage stiffness is a vital parameter for
a grid-forming inverter. If the voltage stiffness is too high, the inverter
picks up all the reactive power demand of the PCC. In contrast, if the
stiffness is too low, the inverter does not participate in voltage regulation
at all. Limiting the reactive power output during a higher voltage sag,
especially when connected to a weak grid, is challenging for a VOC. Entering
into the current control mode is the existing solution, but it severely affects
the effective synchronization between the VOC and the voltages of the PCC. As a
result, the grid-forming mode of operation becomes inefficient. This article
has introduced a Virtual Impedance (VIm) based dynamic voltage stiffness
control technique for VOCs. The systematic design procedure for the proposed
voltage stiffness controller is presented. In addition, a rigorous approach for

considerable interest in many disciplines, most prominently in medicine and
economics. Contemporary research has so far primarily focused on continuous and
binary responses where HTEs are traditionally estimated by a linear model,
which allows the estimation of constant or heterogeneous effects even under
certain model misspecifications. More complex models for survival, count, or
ordinal outcomes require stricter assumptions to reliably estimate the
treatment effect. Most importantly, the noncollapsibility issue necessitates
the joint estimation of treatment and prognostic effects. Model-based forests
allow simultaneous estimation of covariate-dependent treatment and prognostic
effects, but only for randomized trials. In this paper, we propose
modifications to model-based forests to address the confounding issue in
observational data. In particular, we evaluate an orthogonalization strategy
originally proposed by Robinson (1988, Econometrica) in the context of
model-based forests targeting HTE estimation in generalized linear models and
transformation models. We found that this strategy reduces confounding effects
in a simulated study with various outcome distributions. We demonstrate the
practical aspects of HTE estimation for survival and ordinal outcomes by an

materials are candidates for good thermoelectric generators due to their
intrinsic, very low thermal conductivity and high power factor. One of the
current limitations is virtual absence of tetrahedrites exhibiting n--type
conductivity. In this work, first-principles calculations are carried out to
study Mg-doped tetrahedrite,
$\textrm{Mg}_{x}\textrm{Cu}_{12}\textrm{Sb}_{4}\textrm{S}_{13}$ with
possibility of predicting n--type material in mind. Different concentrations
and modifications of the structure are investigated for their formation
energies, preferred site occupation and change in local environment around
dopants. Mg atoms tend to occupy 6b site, while introduced excess Cu prefers
24g site. Introduction of elements in those sites display different effect on
nearby rattling Cu(2) atom. Topological analysis shows that tetrahedrite
exhibits ionic, closed-shell bonds with some degree of covalency. Majority of
the bonds weakens with increasing content of Mg; structure becomes increasingly
less stable, which is also expressed by global instability and bond strain
indexes. Achieving n--type conductivity was predicted by the calculations for
structures with $x>1.0$, however increasing enthalpy of formation and lack of
stability might suggest limit of solubility and difficulties in obtaining those
experimentally.

  for Botnet Detection",,,,,"cs.CR cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Botnet detectors based on machine learning are potential targets for
adversarial evasion attacks. Several research works employ adversarial training
with samples generated from generative adversarial nets (GANs) to make the
botnet detectors adept at recognising adversarial evasions. However, the
synthetic evasions may not follow the original semantics of the input samples.
This paper proposes a novel GAN model leveraged with deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) to explore semantic aware samples and simultaneously harden its
detection. A DRL agent is used to attack the discriminator of the GAN that acts
as a botnet detector. The discriminator is trained on the crafted perturbations
by the agent during the GAN training, which helps the GAN generator converge
earlier than the case without DRL. We name this model RELEVAGAN, i.e. [""relive
a GAN"" or deep REinforcement Learning-based Evasion Generative Adversarial
Network] because, with the help of DRL, it minimises the GAN's job by letting
its generator explore the evasion samples within the semantic limits. During
the GAN training, the attacks are conducted to adjust the discriminator weights
for learning crafted perturbations by the agent. RELEVAGAN does not require
adversarial training for the ML classifiers since it can act as an adversarial
semantic-aware botnet detection model. Code will be available at

to fill a conceptual gap by presenting a distributed diagnosis model that is
consistent with unreliable failure detectors. Results are presented for the
number of tests/monitoring messages required, latency for event detection, as

method. The analysis of temporal and spatiotemporal spectra reveals that the
flow for the strongest forcing in the experiments is composed of two superposed
large and quasi-steady horizontal vortices, of internal waves in box modes and
of much weaker waves outside the modes. Spatial spectra and spectral energy
budget confirm that the flow is in an intermediate regime for very small
horizontal Froude number $F_h$ and buoyancy Reynolds number $R$ close to unity.
Since the forcing frequency $\omega_f$ is just slightly smaller than the

  Two other experimentally feasible sets of parameters are investigated. A
larger amplitude forcing shows that it would indeed be possible to produce in

assume that the Universe is described by several evolution patches, starting
with a de Sitter pre-inflationary bounce which is followed by an quasi-de
Sitter slow-roll inflationary era, followed by a constant equation of state
parameter abnormal reheating era, which is followed by the radiation and matter
domination eras and the late-time acceleration eras. The bounce and the
inflationary era can be realized by vacuum $f(R)$ gravity and the abnormal
reheating and the late-time acceleration eras by the synergy of $f(R)$ gravity
and the prefect matter fluids present. Using well-known reconstruction
techniques we find which $f(R)$ gravity can realize each evolution patch,
except from the matter and radiation domination eras which are realized by the
corresponding matter fluids. Accordingly, we calculate the damping factor of
the primordial de Sitter bounce, and as we show, the signal can be detected by
only one gravitational wave future experiment, in contrast to the case in which

interference devices, scalp MEG promises significantly higher spatial
resolution imaging but it also comes with numerous challenges regarding how to
optimally design OPM arrays. In this context, we sought to provide a systematic
description of MEG spatial resolution as a function of the number of sensors,
sensor-to-brain distance, sensor type, and signal-to-noise ratio. To that aim,
we present an analytical theory based on MEG multipolar expansions that
enables, once supplemented with experimental input and simulations,
quantitative assessment of the limits of MEG spatial resolution in terms of two
qualitatively distinct regimes. In the regime of asymptotically high-density
MEG, we provide a mathematically rigorous description of how magnetic field
smoothness constraints spatial resolution to a slow, logarithmic divergence. In
the opposite regime of low-density MEG, it is sensor density that constraints
spatial resolution to a faster increase following a square-root law. The
transition between these two regimes controls how MEG spatial resolution
saturates as sensors approach sources of neural activity. This two-regime model
of MEG spatial resolution integrates known observations (e.g., the difficulty
of improving spatial resolution by increasing sensor density, the gain brought
by moving sensors on scalp, or the usefulness of multi-component sensors) and
gathers them under a unifying theoretical framework that highlights the
underlying physics and reveals properties inaccessible to simulations. We
propose that this framework may find useful applications to benchmark the

process for the uncertainty introduced by latent code sampling. However, this
generation pattern lacks deterministic constraints for both appearance and
motion, leading to uncontrollable and undesirable outcomes. To this end, we
propose a new task called Text-driven Video Prediction (TVP). Taking the first
frame and text caption as inputs, this task aims to synthesize the following
frames. Specifically, appearance and motion components are provided by the
image and caption separately. The key to addressing the TVP task depends on
fully exploring the underlying motion information in text descriptions, thus
facilitating plausible video generation. In fact, this task is intrinsically a
cause-and-effect problem, as the text content directly influences the motion
changes of frames. To investigate the capability of text in causal inference
for progressive motion information, our TVP framework contains a Text Inference
Module (TIM), producing step-wise embeddings to regulate motion inference for
subsequent frames. In particular, a refinement mechanism incorporating global
motion semantics guarantees coherent generation. Extensive experiments are
conducted on Something-Something V2 and Single Moving MNIST datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better results over
other baselines, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

iconic landmarks but our understanding of the enigmatic flora that lives in
these vertical rock landscapes remains fragmented. In this article, I review
and synthesize recent studies on the evolution of specialization onto bare rock
and its consequences for plant diversification. Putative adaptations commonly
associated with growth on bare rock include specialized root structures, stress
tolerant leaf traits, and reduced dispersibility. Fitness tradeoffs are a
principal explanation for edaphic specialization, but adaptation to bare
environments stands apart as a precursor environment to specialization in other
stressful habitats, such as chemically harsh soils. In species level
phylogenies, many rock specialist plants are evolutionarily isolated and form
the sister lineage to congeners found on decomposed substrates, suggesting that
specialization onto bare rock may be an evolutionary trap or dead end. In other
cases, rock specialists form diverse clades, suggesting archipelago speciation
or ecological release enabled by innovations in stress tolerance. Today, in
environments severely impacted by poor management and introduced organisms,
such as islands, cliffs serve as important refuges for stress tolerant
endangered plants. New technology for climbing safety and drone assisted
reconnaissance open new possibilities for the discovery and conservation of
cliff plants in these landscapes but come with the inherent risks of increasing
their accessibility. The future success of efforts to save plants from

limited computation resources and bandwidth whereas the latter suffers from
communication overheads. We propose a unified distributed and parallel
implementation of SGD (named DPSGD) that relies on both asynchronous
distribution and lock-free parallelism. By combining two strategies into a
unified framework, DPSGD is able to strike a better trade-off between local
computation and communication. The convergence properties of DPSGD are studied
for non-convex problems such as those arising in statistical modelling and
machine learning. Our theoretical analysis shows that DPSGD leads to speed-up
with respect to the number of cores and number of workers while guaranteeing an
asymptotic convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ given that the number of cores
is bounded by $T^{1/4}$ and the number of workers is bounded by $T^{1/2}$ where

DPSGD are demonstrated empirically on a stochastic variational inference
problem (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and on a deep reinforcement learning

Ir(111) and the impact on graphene's electronic structure. Atomically-resolved
scanning tunnelling microscopy images and density functional theory
calculations reveal that boron preferably forms small aggregates of
substitutional defects in geometrically low regions of the moir\'e superlattice
of graphene, by inducing local bending of graphene towards the underlying
Ir(111). Surprisingly, calculations reveal that the incorporation of electron
deficient boron does not lead to an enhanced p-type doping, as the local
rippling of the graphene layer prompts electron uptake from the iridium
substrate that compensates the initial electron loss due to substitutional
boron. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy measurements corroborate that the arrays of boron species do not
modify the electronic structure of graphene near the Fermi level, hence
preserving the slight p-type doping induced by Ir(111).

rapidly in recent years. Six antibodies acting on programmed death ligand 1 or
programmed death 1 pathways were approved in 75 cancer indications between 2015
and 2021. With efforts to expedite regulatory reviews of promising therapies,
several targeted cancer therapies have been granted accelerated approval on the
basis of single-arm phase II trials. And yet, in the absence of randomization,
patient outcomes may not have been studied under standard of care
chemotherapies for emerging biomarker subpopulations prior to the submission of
an accelerated approval application. Historical control rates used in single
arm studies often arise as population averages, lacking specificity to the
targeted subgroup. For example, a recent phase III trial of atezolizumab in
patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma found a 21.6% response rate to
standard of care chemotherapy in the biomarker subgbroup of interest, much
higher than the historical control rate of 10% that had been used to declare
success in the preceding phase II trial. Innovations in design methodology are
needed to enable efficient implementation of randomized trials for agents that
target biomarker subpopulations. This article proposes three randomized designs
for early phase biomarker-guided oncology clinical trials. Each design utilizes
the optimal efficiency predictive probability method to monitor multiple
biomarker subpopulations for futility. A simulation study motivated by the
results reported in the atezolizumab trial is used to evaluate the operating
characteristics of the various designs. Our findings suggest that efficient
statistical design can be conducted with randomization and futility stopping to
effectively acquire more evidence pertaining to comparative efficacy before
deciding to conduct a phase III confirmatory trial.

purpose of this framework is to explore the context-capturing capability of
Transformer, as sequential information is vital for wakeup-word detection.
However, the conventional Transformer encoder is too large to fit our task. To
address this issue, we introduce different model compression approaches to
shrink the vanilla one into a tiny one, called mobile-Transformer. To evaluate
the performance of mobile-Transformer, we conduct extensive experiments on a
large public-available dataset HiMia. The obtained results indicate that
introduced mobile-Transformer significantly outperforms other frequently used

physics and nuclear astrophysics studies. However, due to the complexity of
atomic nuclei and of the non-perturbative strong interaction, up to now, no
conventional physical model can describe nuclear binding energies with a
precision below 0.1 MeV, the accuracy needed by nuclear astrophysical studies.
In this work, artificial neural networks (ANNs), the so called ``universal
approximators"", are used to calculate nuclear binding energies. We show that
the ANN can describe all the nuclei in AME2020 with a root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) around 0.2 MeV, which is better than the best
macroscopic-microscopic models, such as FRDM and WS4. The success of the ANN is
mainly due to the proper and essential input features we identify, which
contain the most relevant physical information, i.e., shell, paring, and
isospin-asymmetry effects. We show that the well-trained ANN has excellent
extrapolation ability and can predict binding energies for those nuclei so far
inaccessible experimentally. In particular, we highlight the important role
played by ``feature engineering'' for physical systems where data are

are imposed. Instead, tree-based approaches such as XGBoost have attracted much
attention for their high performance and ease of use; in particular, they often
achieve state-of-the-art results on tabular data. Consequently, several recent
works have focused on translating Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) models
like XGBoost into federated settings, via cryptographic mechanisms such as
Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). However,
these do not always provide formal privacy guarantees, or consider the full

implement the GBDT model under Differential Privacy (DP). We propose a general
framework that captures and extends existing approaches for differentially
private decision trees. Our framework of methods is tailored to the federated
setting, and we show that with a careful choice of techniques it is possible to
achieve very high utility while maintaining strong levels of privacy.

transient dynamics of high-dimensional nonlinear systems for processing
time-series data. Although reservoir computing was initially proposed to model
information processing in the mammalian cortex, it remains unclear how the
non-random network architecture, such as the modular architecture, in the
cortex integrates with the biophysics of living neurons to characterize the
function of biological neuronal networks (BNNs). Here, we used optogenetics and
fluorescent calcium imaging to record the multicellular responses of cultured
BNNs and employed the reservoir computing framework to decode their
computational capabilities. Micropatterned substrates were used to embed the
modular architecture in the BNNs. We first show that modular BNNs can be used
to classify static input patterns with a linear decoder and that the modularity
of the BNNs positively correlates with the classification accuracy. We then
used a timer task to verify that BNNs possess a short-term memory of ~1 s and
finally show that this property can be exploited for spoken digit
classification. Interestingly, BNN-based reservoirs allow transfer learning,
wherein a network trained on one dataset can be used to classify separate
datasets of the same category. Such classification was not possible when the
input patterns were directly decoded by a linear decoder, suggesting that BNNs
act as a generalization filter to improve reservoir computing performance. Our
findings pave the way toward a mechanistic understanding of information
processing within BNNs and, simultaneously, build future expectations toward
the realization of physical reservoir computing systems based on BNNs.

traditional classification-based entity typing paradigm has two unignorable
drawbacks: 1) it fails to assign an entity to the types beyond the predefined

many long-tail types only have few or even no training instances. To overcome
these drawbacks, we propose a novel generative entity typing (GET) paradigm:
given a text with an entity mention, the multiple types for the role that the
entity plays in the text are generated with a pre-trained language model (PLM).
However, PLMs tend to generate coarse-grained types after fine-tuning upon the
entity typing dataset. Besides, we only have heterogeneous training data
consisting of a small portion of human-annotated data and a large portion of
auto-generated but low-quality data. To tackle these problems, we employ
curriculum learning (CL) to train our GET model upon the heterogeneous data,
where the curriculum could be self-adjusted with the self-paced learning
according to its comprehension of the type granularity and data heterogeneity.
Our extensive experiments upon the datasets of different languages and

the presence of a flow of {\sigma}z, i.e., external-magnetic-field-free current
switching of uniform perpendicular magnetization, a sin2{\phi}-dependent
contribution in spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance signal of in-plane
magnetization ({\phi} is the angle of the external magnetic field with respect
to the current, and a {\phi}-independent but field-dependent contribution in
the second harmonic Hall voltage of in-plane magnetization. This finding
suggests that it is critical to include current spreading effects in the
analyses of various spin polarizations and spin-orbit torques in magnetic
heterostructure. Technologically, our results provide perpendicular effective
magnetic field induced by asymmetric current spreading as a novel, universally
accessible mechanism for efficient, scalable, and external-magnetic-field-free
magnetization switching in memory and computing technologies.

  Game-Theoretic Approach",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite many distributed resource allocation (DRA) algorithms have been
reported in literature, it is still unknown how to allocate the resource
optimally over multiple interacting coalitions. One major challenge in solving
such a problem is that, the relevance of the decision on resource allocation in
a coalition to the benefit of others may lead to conflicts of interest among
these coalitions. Under this context, a new type of multi-coalition game is
formulated in this paper, termed as resource allocation game, where each
coalition contains multiple agents that cooperate to maximize the
coalition-level benefit while subject to the resource constraint described by a
coupled equality. Inspired by techniques such as variable replacement, gradient
tracking and leader-following consensus, two new kinds of DRA algorithms are
developed respectively for the scenarios where the individual benefit of each
agent explicitly depends on the states of itself and some agents in other
coalitions, and on the states of all the game participants. It is shown that
the proposed algorithms can converge linearly to the Nash equilibrium (NE) of
the multi-coalition game while satisfying the resource constraint during the
whole NE-seeking process. Finally, the validity of the present allocation
algorithms is verified by numerical simulations.

single constant. Frequencies of ordinary torsional oscillations (at any n>0

calculated through radial integrals over the neutron star crust, giving the

over noisy channels. Usually, the study of capacities assumes that the circuits
which sender and receiver use for encoding and decoding consist of perfectly
noiseless gates. In the case of communication over quantum channels, however,
this assumption is widely believed to be unrealistic, even in the long-term,
due to the fragility of quantum information, which is affected by the process
of decoherence. Christandl and M\""uller-Hermes have therefore initiated the
study of fault-tolerant channel coding for quantum channels, i.e. coding
schemes where encoder and decoder circuits are affected by noise, and have used
techniques from fault-tolerant quantum computing to establish coding theorems
for sending classical and quantum information in this scenario. Here, we extend
these methods to the case of entanglement-assisted communication, in particular
proving that the fault-tolerant capacity approaches the usual capacity when the
gate error approaches zero. A main tool, which might be of independent
interest, is the introduction of fault-tolerant entanglement distillation. We
furthermore focus on the modularity of the techniques used, so that they can be
easily adopted in other fault-tolerant communication scenarios.

propose FedElasticNet, a communication-efficient and drift-robust FL framework
leveraging the elastic net. It repurposes two types of the elastic net
regularizers (i.e., $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ penalties on the local model
updates): (1) the $\ell_1$-norm regularizer sparsifies the local updates to
reduce the communication costs and (2) the $\ell_2$-norm regularizer resolves
the client drift problem by limiting the impact of drifting local updates due
to data heterogeneity. FedElasticNet is a general framework for FL; hence,
without additional costs, it can be integrated into prior FL techniques, e.g.,
FedAvg, FedProx, SCAFFOLD, and FedDyn. We show that our framework effectively
resolves the communication cost and client drift problems simultaneously.

effects of a surrounding, geometrically thin disc on this precession, as would
be the case in the truncated disc picture of the hard state. To address this,
we perform a set of GRMHD simulations of truncated discs misaligned with the

sub-systems considered are hemispheres in the $left$ and the $right$ dual CFTs
with the equator of the $S^3$ as their boundary. We compute the change in the
mutual information by determining the growth of the HRT surface at late times.
We find that at late times leading upto the scrambling time the minimum value
of the instantaneous Lyapunov index $\lambda_L^{(min)}$ is bounded by
$\kappa=\frac{2\pi T_H}{(1-\mu \,\mathcal{L}_+)}$ and is found to be greater
than $2\pi T_H$ in certain regimes with $T_H$ and $\mu$ denoting the black

$\mathcal{L}_+=\mathcal{L}_{\phi_1}+\mathcal{L}_{\phi_2}$. We also find that
for non-extremal geometries the null perturbation obeys
$\mathcal{L}_+<\mu^{-1}$ for it to reach the outer horizon from the $AdS$
boundary. The scrambling time at very late times is given by
$\kappa\tau_*\approx\log \mathcal{S}$ where $\mathcal{S}$ is the Kerr entropy.
We also find that the onset of scrambling is delayed due to a term proportional
to $\log(1-\mu\,\mathcal{L}_+)^{-1}$ which is not extensive and does not scale
with the entropy of Kerr black hole.

Coming from a stylized oligopoly-game theory focus, researchers recently turned
toward empirical case studies of bygone cartels. Uni- and multivariate time
series analyses reveal that the latter did not supersede the former but filled
a gap the decline in rule-based reasoning has left. Together with a tendency
towards monocultures in topics covered and an endogenous constriction of the
topic variety, the course of cartel research has changed notably: The variety
of subjects included has grown, but the pluralism in economic questions
addressed is in descent. It remains to be seen whether this will benefit or
harm the cartel detection capabilities of authorities in the future.

gained more and more relevance in the last few years. In this context, Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) represents the most effective technique whose results
rival the state of the art hand-crafted architectures. However, this approach
requires a lot of computational capabilities as well as research time, which
makes prohibitive its usage in many real-world scenarios. With its sequential
model-based optimization strategy, Progressive Neural Architecture Search
(PNAS) represents a possible step forward to face this resources issue. Despite
the quality of the found network architectures, this technique is still limited
in research time. A significant step in this direction has been done by
Pareto-Optimal Progressive Neural Architecture Search (POPNAS), which expands
PNAS with a time predictor to enable a trade-off between search time and
accuracy, considering a multi-objective optimization problem. This paper
proposes a new version of the Pareto-Optimal Progressive Neural Architecture
Search, called POPNASv2. Our approach enhances its first version and improves
its performance. We expanded the search space by adding new operators and
improved the quality of both predictors to build more accurate Pareto fronts.
Moreover, we introduced cell equivalence checks and enriched the search
strategy with an adaptive greedy exploration step. Our efforts allow POPNASv2
to achieve PNAS-like performance with an average 4x factor search time
speed-up.

disturbances and time-varying properties that pose a challenge to flight

dropping a payload, traditional PID and RL-based controllers found in
literature struggle to maintain flight after the vehicle changes its dynamics
due to interaction with this external object.
  Methods: In this work, we introduce domain randomization during the training
phase of a low-level waypoint guidance controller based on Soft Actor-Critic.
The resulting controller is evaluated on the proposed payload pick up and drop

  Results & Conclusion: We show that, by introducing a certain degree of
uncertainty in quadrotor dynamics during training, we can obtain a controller
that is capable to perform the proposed task using a larger variation of
quadrotor parameters. Additionally, the RL-based controller outperforms a
traditional positional PID controller with optimized gains in this task, while
remaining agnostic to different simulation parameters.

This paper presents a completely new concept to achieve personalized neural
surrogates in a single coherent framework of meta-learning (metaPNS). Instead
of learning a single neural surrogate, we pursue the process of learning a
personalized neural surrogate using a small amount of context data from a
subject, in a novel formulation of few-shot generative modeling underpinned by:
1) a set-conditioned neural surrogate for cardiac simulation that, conditioned
on subject-specific context data, learns to generate query simulations not
included in the context set, and 2) a meta-model of amortized variational
inference that learns to condition the neural surrogate via simple feed-forward
embedding of context data. As test time, metaPNS delivers a personalized neural
surrogate by fast feed-forward embedding of a small and flexible number of data
available from an individual, achieving -- for the first time --
personalization and surrogate construction for expensive simulations in one
end-to-end learning framework. Synthetic and real-data experiments demonstrated
that metaPNS was able to improve personalization and predictive accuracy in
comparison to conventionally-optimized cardiac simulation models, at a fraction
of computation.

vehicle track the desired longitudinal speeds that are assumed to be generated
by a speed planner. The longitudinal speeds are then passed to a lateral MPC
for lane keeping. Due to the dependence of the lateral dynamics on the
longitudinal speed, they are represented in a linear parameter-varying (LPV)
form, where its scheduling parameter is the longitudinal speed of the vehicle.
In order to deal with the imprecise information of the future longitudinal
speed (the scheduling parameter), a bound of uncertainty is considered around
the nominal trajectory of the future longitudinal velocities. Then, a
tube-based LPV- MPC is adopted to control the lateral dynamics for attaining
the lane keeping goal. In the end, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is

$\beta=0.417\pm0.010$, also consistent with the recovered value for DLAs
($\beta=0.416\pm0.010$). This is consistent with SBLA and DLA systems tracing
different portions of the circumgalactic medium of a broadly common population
of galaxies. Given these common clustering properties, we combined them to
perform a cross-correlation of galaxies in absorption with the Ly$\alpha$

preferred metal contamination model for fitting the correlation functions with

likely due to their status as high redshift precision sites of high metal

to analyze the collected data (e.g., vibration signals) providing a diagnosis
of the asset's operating condition. It is known that models trained with
labeled data (supervised) achieve excellent results, but two main problems make
their application in production processes difficult: (i) impossibility or long
time to obtain a sample of all operational conditions (since faults seldom
happen) and (ii) high cost of experts to label all acquired data. Another
limitating factor for the applicability of AI approaches in this context is the
lack of interpretability of the models (black-boxes), which reduces the
confidence of the diagnosis and trust/adoption from users. To overcome these
problems, a new generic and interpretable approach for classifying faults in
rotating machinery based on transfer learning from augmented synthetic data to
real rotating machinery is here proposed, namelly FaultD-XAI (Fault Diagnosis
using eXplainable AI). To provide scalability using transfer learning,
synthetic vibration signals are created mimicking the characteristic behavior
of failures in operation. The application of Gradient-weighted Class Activation
Mapping (Grad-CAM) with 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) allows the
interpretation of results, supporting the user in decision making and
increasing diagnostic confidence. The proposed approach not only obtained
promising diagnostic performance, but was also able to learn characteristics
used by experts to identify conditions in a source domain and apply them in
another target domain. The experimental results suggest a promising approach on
exploiting transfer learning, synthetic data and explainable artificial
intelligence for fault diagnosis. Lastly, to guarantee reproducibility and
foster research in the field, the developed dataset is made publicly available.

populations. These binaries were suggested to form a hierarchical triple system
with the SMBH, and gravitational perturbations from the SMBH can enhance the
mergers of BBHs through Lidov-Kozai (LK) oscillations. Previous studies
determined the expected binary parameter distribution for this merger channel
in single GNs. Here we account for the different spatial distribution and mass
distribution models of BBHs around SMBHs and perform direct high-precision
regularized N-body simulations, including Post-Newtonian (PN) terms up to order
PN2.5, to model merging BBH populations in single GNs. We use a full
inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model of BBHs with nonzero eccentricities and
take into account the observational selection effect to determine the parameter
distributions of LK-induced BBHs detected with a single advanced
gravitational-wave (GW) detector from all GNs in the Universe. We find that the
detected mergers' total binary mass distribution is tilted towards lower
masses, and the mass ratio distribution is roughly uniform. The redshift
distribution peaks between ~0.15-0.55, and the vast majority of binaries merge
within redshift ~1.1. The fraction of binaries entering the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA
band with residual eccentricities >0.1 is below ~10%. We identify a negative
correlation between residual eccentricity and mass parameters and a negative
correlation between residual eccentricity and source distance. Our results for
the parameter distributions and correlations among binary parameters may make
it possible to disentangle this merger channel from other BBH merger channels
statistically.

extensive tautomer databases, most likely due to the difficulty in experimental

dominant tautomeric form. Specifically, we select active-space molecular
orbitals based on quantum chemistry methods. Then we utilize efficient encoding
methods to map the Hamiltonian onto quantum devices to reduce the qubit
resources and circuit depth. Finally, variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)
algorithms are employed for ground state estimation where hardware-efficient
ansatz circuits are used. To demonstrate the applicability of our methodology,
we perform experiments on two tautomeric systems: acetone and Edaravone, each
having 52 and 150 spin-orbitals in the STO-3G basis set, respectively. Our
numerical results show that their tautomeric state prediction agrees with the
CCSD benchmarks. Moreover, the required quantum resources are efficient: in the
example of Edaravone, we could achieve chemical accuracy with only eight qubits
and 80 two-qubit gates.

data. When an image is translated or rotated, an equivariant model's
representation of that image will translate or rotate accordingly. The success
of convolutional neural networks has historically been tied to translation
equivariance directly encoded in their architecture. The rising success of
vision transformers, which have no explicit architectural bias towards
equivariance, challenges this narrative and suggests that augmentations and
training data might also play a significant role in their performance. In order
to better understand the role of equivariance in recent vision models, we
introduce the Lie derivative, a method for measuring equivariance with strong
mathematical foundations and minimal hyperparameters. Using the Lie derivative,
we study the equivariance properties of hundreds of pretrained models, spanning
CNNs, transformers, and Mixer architectures. The scale of our analysis allows
us to separate the impact of architecture from other factors like model size or
training method. Surprisingly, we find that many violations of equivariance can
be linked to spatial aliasing in ubiquitous network layers, such as pointwise
non-linearities, and that as models get larger and more accurate they tend to
display more equivariance, regardless of architecture. For example,
transformers can be more equivariant than convolutional neural networks after

refrigerator allowing in-situ tuning of dissipation strength in a wide range.
By solving the many-body Lindblad master equation using a combination of the
density matrix renormalization group and third quantization approaches, we show
that the topological end modes and the associated phase transition are visible
in simple reflection measurements with experimentally realistic parameters.
Finally, we demonstrate that genuine quantum effects are observable in this
system via robust and slowly decaying long-range quantum entanglement of the
topological end modes, which can be generated passively starting from a locally

to a wide range of pretrained models taking continuous data inputs and is
independent of the downstream tasks and datasets. Evaluated with several

SynBench score well matches the actual linear probing performance of the

large amount of densely labeled training data for accuracy and robustness,
which is time-consuming and laborious to collect and annotate. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first work to explore unsupervised domain adaptation

data. We develop a cross-modality domain adaptation framework which exploits
both RGB images and surface normal maps generated from depth images. A
Collaborative Cross Guidance (CCG) module is proposed to leverage the context
information of one modality to guide the other modality in a cross manner, thus
realizing inter-modality intra-domain complement. To better bridge the domain

still focuses on individual images or short videos lasting only a few seconds.
This is because handling longer videos require more scalable approaches even to
process them. In this work, we propose a framework enabling research on
hour-long videos with the same hardware that can now process second-long
videos. We replace standard video compression, e.g. JPEG, with neural
compression and show that we can directly feed compressed videos as inputs to
regular video networks. Operating on compressed videos improves efficiency at
all pipeline levels -- data transfer, speed and memory -- making it possible to
train models faster and on much longer videos. Processing compressed signals
has, however, the downside of precluding standard augmentation techniques if
done naively. We address that by introducing a small network that can apply
transformations to latent codes corresponding to commonly used augmentations in
the original video space. We demonstrate that with our compressed vision
pipeline, we can train video models more efficiently on popular benchmarks such
as Kinetics600 and COIN. We also perform proof-of-concept experiments with new

particularly aligned with complex cognition. However, two fundamental questions
remain unanswered: (a) precisely how and why a cognitive system can become
highly synergistic; and (b) how these informational states map onto artificial
neural networks in various learning modes. To address these questions, here we
employ an information-decomposition framework to investigate the information
processing strategies adopted by simple artificial neural networks performing a
variety of cognitive tasks in both supervised and reinforcement learning
settings. Our results show that synergy increases as neural networks learn
multiple diverse tasks. Furthermore, performance in tasks requiring integration
of multiple information sources critically relies on synergistic neurons.
Finally, randomly turning off neurons during training through dropout increases
network redundancy, corresponding to an increase in robustness. Overall, our
results suggest that while redundant information is required for robustness to
perturbations in the learning process, synergistic information is used to
combine information from multiple modalities -- and more generally for flexible

regression tasks is known to be challenging: it often requires computing node
features that are mindful of both local interactions in their neighbourhood and
the global context of the graph structure. GNN architectures that navigate this
space need to avoid pathological behaviours, such as bottlenecks and
oversquashing, while ideally having linear time and space complexity
requirements. In this work, we propose an elegant approach based on propagating
information over expander graphs. We leverage an efficient method for
constructing expander graphs of a given size, and use this insight to propose
the EGP model. We show that EGP is able to address all of the above concerns,
while requiring minimal effort to set up, and provide evidence of its empirical
utility on relevant graph classification datasets and baselines in the Open
Graph Benchmark. Importantly, using expander graphs as a template for message
passing necessarily gives rise to negative curvature. While this appears to be
counterintuitive in light of recent related work on oversquashing, we
theoretically demonstrate that negatively curved edges are likely to be
required to obtain scalable message passing without bottlenecks. To the best of
our knowledge, this is a previously unstudied result in the context of graph
representation learning, and we believe our analysis paves the way to a novel
class of scalable methods to counter oversquashing in GNNs.

  Thoracic Disease Classification from X-Ray Images",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Computer-aided disease diagnosis and prognosis based on medical images is a
rapidly emerging field. Many Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures
have been developed by researchers for disease classification and localization
from chest X-ray images. It is known that different thoracic disease lesions
are more likely to occur in specific anatomical regions compared to others.
Based on this knowledge, we first estimate a disease-dependent spatial
probability, i.e., an anatomical prior, that indicates the probability of
occurrence of a disease in a specific region in a chest X-ray image. Next, we
develop a novel attention-based classification model that combines information
from the estimated anatomical prior and automatically extracted chest region of
interest (ROI) masks to provide attention to the feature maps generated from a
deep convolution network. Unlike previous works that utilize various
self-attention mechanisms, the proposed method leverages the extracted chest
ROI masks along with the probabilistic anatomical prior information, which
selects the region of interest for different diseases to provide attention. The
proposed method shows superior performance in disease classification on the NIH
ChestX-ray14 dataset compared to existing state-of-the-art methods while
reaching an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.8427. Regarding disease
localization, the proposed method shows competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an accuracy of 61% with an Intersection
over Union (IoU) threshold of 0.3. The proposed method can also be generalized
to other medical image-based disease classification and localization tasks
where the probability of occurrence of the lesion is dependent on specific
anatomical sites.

language processing (NLP), DNNs have been increasingly applied in source code
analysis and attracted significant attention from the software engineering
community. Due to its data-driven nature, a DNN model requires massive and
high-quality labeled training data to achieve expert-level performance.
Collecting such data is often not hard, but the labeling process is notoriously
laborious. The task of DNN-based code analysis even worsens the situation
because source code labeling also demands sophisticated expertise. Data
augmentation has been a popular approach to supplement training data in domains
such as computer vision and NLP. However, existing data augmentation approaches
in code analysis adopt simple methods, such as data transformation and
adversarial example generation, thus bringing limited performance superiority.
In this paper, we propose a data augmentation approach MIXCODE that aims to
effectively supplement valid training data, inspired by the recent advance
named Mixup in computer vision. Specifically, we first utilize multiple code
refactoring methods to generate transformed code that holds consistent labels
with the original data. Then, we adapt the Mixup technique to mix the original
code with the transformed code to augment the training data. We evaluate
MIXCODE on two programming languages (Java and Python), two code tasks (problem
classification and bug detection), four benchmark datasets (JAVA250, Python800,
CodRep1, and Refactory), and seven model architectures (including two
pre-trained models CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT). Experimental results
demonstrate that MIXCODE outperforms the baseline data augmentation approach by
up to 6.24% in accuracy and 26.06% in robustness.

computational advantage over the standard Monte Carlo approach. This method

This paper addresses a central question: Is it possible to directly leverage 2D

propose XDGAN, an effective and fast method for applying 2D image GAN
architectures to the generation of 3D object geometry combined with additional

novel method to convert 3D shapes into compact 1-channel geometry images and
leverage StyleGAN3 and image-to-image translation networks to generate 3D
objects in 2D space. The generated geometry images are quick to convert to 3D
meshes, enabling real-time 3D object synthesis, visualization and interactive
editing. Moreover, the use of standard 2D architectures can help bring more 2D
advances into the 3D realm. We show both quantitatively and qualitatively that
our method is highly effective at various tasks such as 3D shape generation,
single view reconstruction and shape manipulation, while being significantly
faster and more flexible compared to recent 3D generative models.

attention in recent years for their ability to approximate the
parameter-to-solution maps defined by PDEs using as training data solutions of
PDEs at a limited number of parameter samples. The computational cost of BIPs
can be drastically reduced if the large number of PDE solves required for
posterior characterization are replaced with evaluations of trained neural
operators. However, reducing error in the resulting BIP solutions via reducing
the approximation error of the neural operators in training can be challenging
and unreliable. We provide an a priori error bound result that implies certain
BIPs can be ill-conditioned to the approximation error of neural operators,
thus leading to inaccessible accuracy requirements in training. To reliably
deploy neural operators in BIPs, we consider a strategy for enhancing the
performance of neural operators, which is to correct the prediction of a
trained neural operator by solving a linear variational problem based on the
PDE residual. We show that a trained neural operator with error correction can
achieve a quadratic reduction of its approximation error, all while retaining
substantial computational speedups of posterior sampling when models are
governed by highly nonlinear PDEs. The strategy is applied to two numerical
examples of BIPs based on a nonlinear reaction--diffusion problem and
deformation of hyperelastic materials. We demonstrate that posterior
representations of the two BIPs produced using trained neural operators are

  Forecasting","10 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Feature engineering is required to obtain better results for time series
forecasting, and decomposition is a crucial one. One decomposition approach
often cannot be used for numerous forecasting tasks since the standard time
series decomposition lacks flexibility and robustness. Traditional feature
selection relies heavily on preexisting domain knowledge, has no generic
methodology, and requires a lot of labor. However, most time series prediction
models based on deep learning typically suffer from interpretability issue, so
the ""black box"" results lead to a lack of confidence. To deal with the above
issues forms the motivation of the thesis. In the paper we propose TSDFNet as a
neural network with self-decomposition mechanism and an attentive feature
fusion mechanism, It abandons feature engineering as a preprocessing convention
and creatively integrates it as an internal module with the deep model. The
self-decomposition mechanism empowers TSDFNet with extensible and adaptive
decomposition capabilities for any time series, users can choose their own
basis functions to decompose the sequence into temporal and generalized spatial
dimensions. Attentive feature fusion mechanism has the ability to capture the
importance of external variables and the causality with target variables. It
can automatically suppress the unimportant features while enhancing the
effective ones, so that users do not have to struggle with feature selection.
Moreover, TSDFNet is easy to look into the ""black box"" of the deep neural
network by feature visualization and analyze the prediction results. We
demonstrate performance improvements over existing widely accepted models on
more than a dozen datasets, and three experiments showcase the interpretability
of TSDFNet.

classification. Graph pooling which processes node representation into the
entire graph representation, which can be used for multiple downstream tasks,
e.g., graph classification, is a crucial component of GNNs. Recently, to
enhance graph learning, Manifold Mixup, a data augmentation strategy that mixes
the graph data vector after the pooling layer, has been introduced. However,
since there are a series of graph pooling methods, how they affect the
effectiveness of such a Mixup approach is unclear. In this paper, we take the
first step to explore the influence of graph pooling methods on the
effectiveness of the Mixup-based data augmentation approach. Specifically, 9
types of hybrid pooling methods are considered in the study, e.g.,
$\mathcal{M}_{sum}(\mathcal{P}_{att},\mathcal{P}_{max})$. The experimental
results on both natural language datasets (Gossipcop, Politifact) and
programming language datasets (Java250, Python800) demonstrate that hybrid
pooling methods are more suitable for Mixup than the standard max pooling and
the state-of-the-art graph multiset transformer (GMT) pooling, in terms of
metric accuracy and robustness.

three-dimensional structure, is one of the fundamental design challenges in
bio-engineering and drug discovery. Traditionally, inverse folding mainly
involves learning from sequences that have an experimentally resolved
structure. However, the known structures cover only a tiny space of the protein
sequences, imposing limitations on the model learning. Recently proposed
forward folding models, e.g., AlphaFold, offer unprecedented opportunity for
accurate estimation of the structure given a protein sequence. Naturally,
incorporating a forward folding model as a component of an inverse folding
approach offers the potential of significantly improving the inverse folding,
as the folding model can provide a feedback on any generated sequence in the
form of the predicted protein structure or a structural confidence metric.
However, at present, these forward folding models are still prohibitively slow
to be a part of the model optimization loop during training. In this work, we
propose to perform knowledge distillation on the folding model's confidence
metrics, e.g., pTM or pLDDT scores, to obtain a smaller, faster and end-to-end
differentiable distilled model, which then can be included as part of the
structure consistency regularized inverse folding model training. Moreover, our
regularization technique is general enough and can be applied in other design
tasks, e.g., sequence-based protein infilling. Extensive experiments show a
clear benefit of our method over the non-regularized baselines. For example, in
inverse folding design problems we observe up to 3% improvement in sequence
recovery and up to 45% improvement in protein diversity, while still preserving
structural consistency of the generated sequences.

deviate slightly or when composed hierarchically to solve even more complex

a single one, that are driven to explore different regions of the state-action
space can address this shortcoming by generating a diverse set of behaviors,
referred to as skills, that can be collectively used to great effect in
adaptation tasks or for hierarchical planning. This is typically realized by
including a diversity term - often derived from information theory - in the
objective function optimized by RL. However these approaches often require
careful hyperparameter tuning to be effective. In this work, we demonstrate
that less widely-used neuroevolution methods, specifically Quality Diversity

Layerwise Graph Theory-Based Intrusion Detection System (LGTBIDS) algorithm is
designed to detect the attacked node. The algorithm performs the layer-wise
analysis to extract the vulnerable nodes and ultimately the attacked node(s).
For each layer, every node is scanned for the possibility of susceptible

the range of upper and lower thresholds are detected as the nodes under attack.
Further, detected node(s) are transmitted with a random sequence of bits

overrepresented in positions of status and influence (i.e. full professors,
chairs, deans, etc.), positioning them as a potentially powerful demographic

Yet, they
are also utterly inaccessible to experimentation, and even just indirect
observation poses significant technical challenges. The phenomenological
approach of thermodynamics is uniquely suited to explore at least some of the
physical properties of such scenarios, and this has motivated the study of
so-called holographic engines. We show that the efficiency of an endoreversible
Brayton cycle is given by the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency if the engine is fueled
by a 2-dimensional ideal gas; and that the efficiency is higher, if the working
medium is a (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole. These findings may be relevant
not only in the quest to unlock the mysteries of black holes, but also for
potential technological applications of graphene.

extended states can form a continuum. We demonstrate how this principle fails
for non-Hermitian systems, by analyzing non-Hermitian continuous Hamiltonians
with an imaginary momentum and Landau-type vector potential. The eigenstates,
which we call ``continuum Landau modes'' (CLMs), have gaussian spatial
envelopes and form a continuum filling the complex energy plane. We present
experimentally-realizable 1D and 2D lattice models that can be used to study
CLMs; the lattice eigenstates are localized and have other features that are
the same as in the continuous model. One of these lattices can serve as a
rainbow trap, whereby the response to an excitation is concentrated at a
position proportional to the frequency. Another lattice can act a wave funnel,
concentrating an input excitation onto a boundary over a wide frequency
bandwidth. Unlike recent funneling schemes based on the non-Hermitian skin
effect, this requires only a simple lattice design without nonreciprocal
couplings.

patient registry to report a predictive performance F1 score of 0.91 at
distinguishing CE patients from children with severe neurologic injury without
CE. In addition, we perform analysis of our systems output to determine the
association of CE with Abusive Head Trauma (AHT) , a type of traumatic brain

hospital mortality of infants and young children. We used two clinical
variables, AHT diagnosis and Functional Status Scale (FSS) score, to arrive at
the conclusion that CE is highly correlated with overall outcome and that
further study is needed to determine whether CE is a biomarker of AHT. With
that, this paper introduces a simple yet powerful deep learning based solution
for automated CE classification. This solution also enables an indepth analysis
of progression of CE and its correlation to AHT and overall neurologic outcome,
which in turn has the potential to empower experts to diagnose and mitigate AHT

equations is realized using the numerical flux operating on the equivalent

matrices upon discretization. Inclusion of the BI equation ensures that the
only error in enforcing the radiation conditions is the discretization.
However, the discretization of this equation yields a dense matrix, which
prohibits the use of a direct matrix solver on the overall coupled system as
often done with traditional HDG schemes. To overcome this bottleneck, a
``hybrid'' method is developed. This method uses an iterative scheme to solve
the overall coupled system but within the matrix-vector multiplication
subroutine of the iterations, the inverse of the HDG matrix is efficiently
accounted for using a sparse direct matrix solver. The same subroutine also
uses the multilevel fast multipole algorithm to accelerate the multiplication
of the guess vector with the dense BI matrix. The numerical results demonstrate
the accuracy, the efficiency, and the applicability of the proposed HDG-BI
solver.

numerous applications in biomedicine. Therapeutic antibody development requires
designing novel and diverse sequences with improved properties, while

graph neural networks have shown impressive success in antibody sequence
generation. Since only a limited number of antibody structures are known,
training a model using this limited data can lead to degraded performance,
particularly lacking diversity in the generated samples. To address such
issues, we leverage the method of Model Reprogramming (MR), which focuses on
repurposing pretrained machine learning models for target domain tasks with
scarce data, where it may be difficult to train a high-performing model from
scratch. We introduce Reprogramming for Protein Sequence Infilling, a framework
in which pretrained natural language models are repurposed for protein sequence
infilling via reprogramming, to infill protein sequence templates as a method
of novel protein generation. For variable CDR sequence design, we formulate the
task as text infilling that uses the constant region of an antibody as the
sequence template. Results on antibody design benchmarks show that our
reprogrammed model on low resourced antibody sequence dataset provides highly
diverse CDR sequences, up to more than a two-fold increase of diversity over
the baselines, without losing structural integrity and naturalness. The
performance benefit of the reprogrammed model learning only from antibody
sequences is more evident for longer CDR design or for multiple loop infilling
at once, compared to existing graph-based models that require additional
structural information. The generated sequences also demonstrate enhanced
antigen binding specificity or virus neutralization ability.

mainly focuses on students' dynamic cognitive states of skills. The
question-answering process of students can be regarded as a thinking process
that considers the following two problems. One problem is which skills are
needed to answer the question, and the other is how to use these skills in
order. If a student wants to answer a question correctly, the student should
not only master the set of skills involved in the question but also think and
obtain the associative path on the skills graph. The nodes in the associative
path refer to the skills needed and the path shows the order of using them. The
associative path is referred to as the skill mode. Thus, obtaining the skill
modes is the key to answering questions successfully. However, most existing KT
models only focus on a set of skills, without considering the skill modes. We
propose a KT model, called APGKT, that exploits skill modes. Specifically, we
extract the subgraph topology of the skills involved in the question and
combine the difficulty level of the skills to obtain the skill modes via
encoding; then, through multi-layer recurrent neural networks, we obtain a
student's higher-order cognitive states of skills, which is used to predict the

designed to model knowledge by observing relatively small problem-solving steps
in Intelligent Tutoring Systems. While these approaches were applied
successfully to model student knowledge by observing student solutions for
simple problems, they do not perform well for modeling complex problem solving
in students.M ost importantly, current models assume that all problem attempts
are equally valuable in quantifying current student knowledge.However, for
complex problems that involve many concepts at the same time, this assumption
is deficient. In this paper, we argue that not all attempts are equivalently
important in discovering students' knowledge state, and some attempts can be
summarized together to better represent student performance. We propose a novel
student knowledge tracing approach, Granular RAnk based TEnsor factorization

solutions currently implemented are based on reference trajectories and lead to
sub-optimal fuel usage. Other solutions are based on simple guidance laws that
need to be updated periodically, increasing the cost of operations. Whereas
some optimization strategies leverage Artificial Intelligence methods, all of
the approaches studied so far need either previously generated data or a strong
a priori knowledge of the satellite dynamics. This study uses model-free
Reinforcement Learning to train an agent on a constrained pericenter raising
scenario for a low-thrust medium-Earth-orbit satellite. The agent does not have
any prior knowledge of the environment dynamics, which makes it unbiased from
classical trajectory optimization patterns. The trained agent is then used to
design a trajectory and to autonomously control the satellite during the
cruise. Simulations show that a dynamics-agnostic agent is able to learn a
quasi-optimal guidance law and responds well to uncertainties in the
environment dynamics. The results obtained open the door to the usage of
Reinforcement Learning on more complex scenarios, multi-satellite problems, or
to explore trajectories in environments where a reference solution is not known

  CryptoQuant data using Synthesizer Transformer models","Co-first authors",,,,"q-fin.TR cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile compared to traditional
financial markets. Hence, forecasting its volatility is crucial for risk
management. In this paper, we investigate CryptoQuant data (e.g. on-chain
analytics, exchange and miner data) and whale-alert tweets, and explore their
relationship to Bitcoin's next-day volatility, with a focus on extreme
volatility spikes. We propose a deep learning Synthesizer Transformer model for
forecasting volatility. Our results show that the model outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models when forecasting extreme volatility spikes for Bitcoin
using CryptoQuant data as well as whale-alert tweets. We analysed our model
with the Captum XAI library to investigate which features are most important.
We also backtested our prediction results with different baseline trading
strategies and the results show that we are able to minimize drawdown while
keeping steady profits. Our findings underscore that the proposed method is a
useful tool for forecasting extreme volatility movements in the Bitcoin market.

from Project Sidewalk to study the distribution and condition of sidewalks in
Seattle, WA. While potentially noisier than professionally gathered sidewalk
datasets, crowdsourced data enables large, cross-regional studies that would be
otherwise expensive and difficult to manage. As an initial case study, we
examine spatial patterns of sidewalk quality in Seattle and their relationship
to racial diversity, income level, built density, and transit modes. We close
with a reflection on our approach, key limitations, and opportunities for
future work.
