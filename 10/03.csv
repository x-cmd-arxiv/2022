of 1.0"", and sensitivity of $\sim60 \mu$Jy~beam$^{-1}$; making it the most
sensitive radio survey covering a large area of the Galactic plane with this
angular resolution. An automatic source extraction algorithm was used in
combination with visual inspection to identify a total of 3325 radio sources. A
total of 1457 radio sources are $\geq7\sigma$ and comprise our highly reliable
catalog; 72 of these are grouped as 22 fragmented sources, e.g., multiple
components of an extended and resolved source. To explore the nature of the
catalogued radio sources we searched for counterparts at millimeter and
infrared wavelengths. Our classification attempts resulted in 93 HII region
candidates, 104 radio stars, 64 planetary nebulae, while most of the remaining
radio sources are suggested to be extragalactic sources. We investigated the
spectral indices ($\alpha$, $S_\nu\propto\nu^\alpha$) of radio sources
classified as HII region candidates and found that many have negative values.
This may imply that these radio sources represent young stellar objects that
are members of the star clusters around the high mass stars that excite the HII
regions, but not these HII regions themselves. By comparing the peak flux
densities from the GLOSTAR and CORNISH surveys we have identified 49 variable
radio sources, most of them with an unknown nature. Additionally, we provide

This paper proposes Wenquxing 22A, a low-power neuromorphic processor that
combines general-purpose CPU functions and SNN to efficiently compute it with
RISC-V SNN extension instructions. The main idea of Wenquxing 22A is to
integrate the SNN calculation unit into the pipeline of a general-purpose CPU

  In this work, a swarm of silent and oblivious robots are deployed on an

Each robot knows to which team it belongs, but can not recognize the team of

is presented in this paper which leads the robots with the input pattern into

because of the molecular interaction with the atmosphere in the form of
subsequent absorption and re-radiation. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS) has emerged as a potential technology to assist in THz
communications by boosting signal power or providing virtual line-of-sight
paths. However, the re-radiated energy has either been modeled as a
non-line-of-sight scattering component or as additive Gaussian noise in the
literature. Since the precise characterization is still a work in progress,
this paper presents the first comparative investigation of the performance of
an RIS-aided THz system under these two extreme re-radiation models. In
particular, we first develop a novel parametric channel model that encompasses
both models of the re-radiation through a simple parameter change, and then
utilize that to design a robust block-coordinate descent (BCD) algorithmic
framework which maximizes a lower bound on channel capacity considering
imperfect channel state information. In this framework, the original problem is
split into two sub-problems: a) receive beamformer optimization, and b) RIS
phase-shift optimization. We also analytically demonstrate the limited
interference suppression capability of a passive RIS. Our numerical results
also demonstrate that slightly better throughput is achieved when the
re-radiation manifests as scattering.

approximation of maps between topologically interesting manifolds? The answer
is with a coordinate projection. Neural networks based on topological data
analysis (TDA) use tools such as persistent homology to learn topological
signatures of data and stabilize training but may not be universal
approximators or have stable inverses. Other architectures universally
approximate data distributions on submanifolds but only when the latter are
given by a single chart, making them unable to learn maps that change topology.
By exploiting the topological parallels between locally bilipschitz maps,
covering spaces, and local homeomorphisms, and by using universal approximation
arguments from machine learning, we find that a novel network of the form
$\mathcal{T} \circ p \circ \mathcal{E}$, where $\mathcal{E}$ is an injective
network, $p$ a fixed coordinate projection, and $\mathcal{T}$ a bijective
network, is a universal approximator of local diffeomorphisms between compact
smooth submanifolds embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We emphasize the case when the
target map changes topology. Further, we find that by constraining the
projection $p$, multivalued inversions of our networks can be computed without
sacrificing universality. As an application, we show that learning a group
invariant function with unknown group action naturally reduces to the question
of learning local diffeomorphisms for finite groups. Our theory permits us to
recover orbits of the group action. We also outline possible extensions of our
architecture to address molecular imaging of molecules with symmetries.
Finally, our analysis informs the choice of topologically expressive starting
spaces in generative problems.

materials searches including 2500 binary and ternary structure prototypes and
spanning about 1 billion compounds. After validation using density-functional
theory, we uncover in total 19512 additional materials on the convex hull of
thermodynamic stability and ~150000 compounds with a distance of less than 50

we finally evaluate the discovered materials for applications as
superconductors, superhard materials, and we look for candidates with large gap

seemingly memorize any training set. This introduces a problem when training in
the presence of noisy labels, as the noisy examples cannot be distinguished

challenge by utilizing the fact that deep networks seem to memorize clean
examples much earlier than noisy examples. Here we report a new empirical
result: for each example, when looking at the time it has been memorized by
each model in an ensemble of networks, the diversity seen in noisy examples is
much larger than the clean examples. We use this observation to develop a new
method for noisy labels filtration. The method is based on a statistics of the

clean and noisy data. We test our method on three tasks: (i) noise amount
estimation; (ii) noise filtration; (iii) supervised classification. We show
that our method improves over existing baselines in all three tasks using a

performance, our method has two other advantages. (i) Simplicity, which implies

leverage Byzantine-robust federated learning methods or detect malicious

classify a test input. Specifically, we consider two methods to group the
clients and propose two variants of FLCert correspondingly, i.e., FLCert-P that
randomly samples clients in each group, and FLCert-D that divides clients to
disjoint groups deterministically. Our extensive experiments on multiple

vision. One practical solution is to take advantage of temporal information
from the video and apply feature aggregation to enhance the object features in
each frame. Though effective, those existing methods always suffer from low
inference speeds because they use a fixed number of frames for feature
aggregation regardless of the input frame. Therefore, this paper aims to
improve the inference speed of the current feature aggregation-based video
object detectors while maintaining their performance. To achieve this goal, we
propose a vanilla dynamic aggregation module that adaptively selects the frames
for feature enhancement. Then, we extend the vanilla dynamic aggregation module
to a more effective and reconfigurable deformable version. Finally, we
introduce inplace distillation loss to improve the representations of objects
aggregated with fewer frames. Extensive experimental results validate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods: On the ImageNet VID

compare dropout variational inference (DO), test-time augmentation (TTA),
conformal predictions, and single deterministic methods for estimating
uncertainty using our model trained to predict feeding tube placement for 271

under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value
(PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) trends for each method at various
cutoffs that sought to stratify patients into 'certain' and 'uncertain'
cohorts. These cutoffs were obtained by calculating the percentile
""uncertainty"" within the validation cohort and applied to the testing cohort.
Broadly, the AUC, sensitivity, and NPV increased as the predictions were more
'certain' -- i.e., lower uncertainty estimates. However, when a majority vote
(implementing 2/3 criteria: DO, TTA, conformal predictions) or a stricter
approach (3/3 criteria) were used, AUC, sensitivity, and NPV improved without a
notable loss in specificity or PPV. Especially for smaller, single
institutional datasets, it may be important to evaluate multiple estimations
techniques before incorporating a model into clinical practice.

domains, including computational biology, it is often necessary to understand
which data features are essential for the model's decision. Despite extensive
recent efforts to define different feature importance metrics for deep learning
models, we identified that inherent stochasticity in the design and training of
deep learning models makes commonly used feature importance scores unstable.
This results in varied explanations or selections of different features across
different runs of the model. We demonstrate how the signal strength of features
and correlation among features directly contribute to this instability. To
address this instability, we explore the ensembling of feature importance
scores of models across different epochs and find that this simple approach can
substantially address this issue. For example, we consider knockoff inference
as they allow feature selection with statistical guarantees. We discover
considerable variability in selected features in different epochs of deep
learning training, and the best selection of features doesn't necessarily occur
at the lowest validation loss, the conventional approach to determine the best
model. As such, we present a framework to combine the feature importance of
trained models across different hyperparameter settings and epochs, and instead
of selecting features from one best model, we perform an ensemble of feature
importance scores from numerous good models. Across the range of experiments in
simulated and various real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed
framework consistently improves the power of feature selection.

throwing behavior. In particular, throwing will enable robots to rapidly place
the object into the target basket, located outside its feasible kinematic
space, without traveling to the desired location. In previous approaches, the
robot often learned a parameterized throwing kernel through analytical
approaches, imitation learning, or hand-coding. There are many situations in
which such approaches do not work/generalize well due to various object shapes,
heterogeneous mass distribution, and also obstacles that might be presented in
the environment. It is obvious that a method is needed to modulate the throwing
kernel through its meta parameters. In this paper, we tackle object throwing
problem through a deep reinforcement learning approach that enables robots to
precisely throw objects into moving baskets while there are obstacles
obstructing the path. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group that
addresses throwing objects with obstacle avoidance. Such a throwing skill not
only increases the physical reachability of a robot arm but also improves the
execution time. In particular, the robot detects the pose of the target object,
basket, and obstacle at each time step, predicts the proper grasp configuration
for the target object, and then infers appropriate parameters to throw the
object into the basket. Due to safety constraints, we develop a simulation
environment in Gazebo to train the robot and then use the learned policy in
real-robot directly. To assess the performers of the proposed approach, we
perform extensive sets of experiments in both simulation and real robots in
three scenarios. Experimental results showed that the robot could precisely
throw a target object into the basket outside its kinematic range and
generalize well to new locations and objects without colliding with obstacles.

natural approach is to utilize the idea of infrequent communications (through
multiple local updates) same as in conventional federated learning. However,
due to the more complicated inter-outer problem structure in federated min-max
learning, theoretical understandings of communication complexity for federated
min-max learning with infrequent communications remain very limited in the
literature. This is particularly true for settings with non-i.i.d. datasets and
partial client participation. To address this challenge, in this paper, we
propose a new algorithmic framework called stochastic sampling averaging
gradient descent ascent (SAGDA), which i) assembles stochastic gradient
estimators from randomly sampled clients as control variates and ii) leverages
two learning rates on both server and client sides. We show that SAGDA achieves
a linear speedup in terms of both the number of clients and local update steps,
which yields an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ communication complexity that is
orders of magnitude lower than the state of the art. Interestingly, by noting
that the standard federated stochastic gradient descent ascent (FSGDA) is in
fact a control-variate-free special version of SAGDA, we immediately arrive at
an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ communication complexity result for FSGDA.
Therefore, through the lens of SAGDA, we also advance the current understanding
on communication complexity of the standard FSGDA method for federated min-max
learning.

possible to learn accurate surrogate dynamics of a high-resolution system on a

questions about the nature of linguistic meaning and ways in which it can be
processed by natural and artificial systems. One such question has to do with
subword segmentation algorithms widely employed in language modeling, machine
translation, and other tasks since 2016. These algorithms often cut words into
semantically opaque pieces, such as 'period', 'on', 't', and 'ist' in
'period|on|t|ist'. The system then represents the resulting segments in a dense
vector space, which is expected to model grammatical relations among them. This
representation may in turn be used to map 'period|on|t|ist' (English) to
'par|od|ont|iste' (French). Thus, instead of being modeled at the lexical
level, translation is reformulated more generally as the task of learning the
best bilingual mapping between the sequences of subword segments of two
languages; and sometimes even between pure character sequences:
'p|e|r|i|o|d|o|n|t|i|s|t' $\rightarrow$ 'p|a|r|o|d|o|n|t|i|s|t|e'. Such subword
segmentations and alignments are at work in highly efficient end-to-end machine
translation systems, despite their allegedly opaque nature. The computational
value of such processes is unquestionable. But do they have any linguistic or
philosophical plausibility? I attempt to cast light on this question by
reviewing the relevant details of the subword segmentation algorithms and by
relating them to important philosophical and linguistic debates, in the spirit
of making artificial intelligence more transparent and explainable.

several classical Banach space properties such as being a G.T. space. A
detailed investigation of basic sequences and sublattices of free Banach

Because this method involves specifying a constitutive time-dependent

show that the inconsistencies in this method are due to a lack of sensitivity
of the model with respect to its parameters. Using approaches from information
theory, this lack of sensitivity can be interpreted as a narrowed distribution
of information which is obtained from the experiment. Furthermore, the
equivalent representation of the problem in the frequency domain, achieved via
modified Fourier transformation, offers an enhanced sensitivity through a
widening of the information distribution. Using these distributions, we then
define restrictions for the timescales which can be reliably accessed in both
the time and frequency domains, which leads to the conclusion that the analysis
of experiments in the time domain can frequently lead to inaccuracies. Finally,

multiphase flow measurements. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a
sensor, such as a microwave sensor, which can continuously measure the salinity
of a flow. In addition to salinity measurement, the microwave sensor can also
measure water fraction, which is required for a multiphase flowmeter based on
single-energy gamma-ray attenuation; however, choosing a suitable probe sensing
location for a microwave salinity sensor in a multiphase flowmeter can be
challenging, as the sensor needs to be located at near-wall liquid-rich region
to accommodate a wide range of flow conditions. Currently, a microwave sensor
is installed in the lower area of a horizontal blind-tee inlet spool of a
multiphase flowmeter for salinity measurement. Integrating the microwave sensor
into the vertically mounted multiphase flowmeter can reduce the flowmeter
(carbon) footprint and manufacturing costs and can improve water-to-liquid
ratio measurement due to faster local oil-water mixing. The associated
challenge is that the sensor needs to be located at near-wall liquid-rich
region to accommodate a wide range of flow conditions, including high
gas-volume-fraction flows, where the near-wall liquid layer present in the
vertical pipe is usually very thin. In this study, computational fluid dynamics
modeling is used to evaluate the suitability of four different sensing
locations along the vertical cross-section of a Venturi-based multiphase
flowmeter based on near-wall liquid-richness. The results show that the Venturi
inlet is the most suitable location for microwave sensor measurement, compared
to the mid-convergence section, the mid-divergence section, and the Venturi
outlet for a range of inlet liquid-volume-fractions. The findings have been
validated by experimental microwave sensor measurements in a multiphase flow
loop facility.

Clearly, the idea of harnessing the powerful abilities of such networks to

hands-off approach seems enticing. And based on the observed performance, the
heuristic promises to be highly scalable, with a computational cost linear in
the input size $n$, although there is likely a significant overhead in the
pre-factor due to the GNN itself. However, closer inspection shows that the
reported results for this GNN are only minutely better than those for gradient

linear downshift dependence with temperature. However, for ZrS2, we see an
upshift (blueshift) with temperature for A1g mode, which is attributed to
non-harmonic effects caused by dipolar coupling with IR-active modes. Moreover,
the observed temperature dependence coefficient for some phonon modes of quasi

errors, in particular by non-common path aberrations (NCPAs). Focal-plane
wavefront sensing (FPWFS) is appropriate to handle NCPAs because it measures
the aberration where it matters the most, that is to say at the science focal
plane. Phase retrieval from focal-plane images results, nonetheless, in a sign
ambiguity for even modes of the pupil-plane phase. The phase diversity methods
currently used to solve the sign ambiguity tend to reduce the science duty
cycle, that is, the fraction of observing time dedicated to science. In this
work, we explore how we can combine the phase diversity provided by a vortex
coronagraph with modern deep learning techniques to perform efficient FPWFS
without losing observing time. We applied the state-of-the-art convolutional
neural network EfficientNet-B4 to infer phase aberrations from simulated
focal-plane images. The two cases of scalar and vector vortex coronagraphs (SVC
and VVC) were considered using a single post-coronagraphic point spread
function (PSF) or two PSFs obtained by splitting the circular polarization
states, respectively. The sign ambiguity has been properly lifted in both cases
even at low signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns). Using either the SVC or the VVC, we
have reached a very similar performance compared to using phase diversity with
a defocused PSF, except for high levels of aberrations where the SVC slightly
underperforms compared to the other approaches. The models finally show great
robustness when trained on data with a wide range of wavefront errors and noise
levels. The proposed FPWFS technique provides a 100% science duty cycle for
instruments using a vortex coronagraph and does not require any additional
hardware in the case of the SVC.

angular coverage of the JWST data, the strong lensing models only cover the
central region. X-ray analysis on the hot ICM is necessary to obtain a more
complete constraint on the mass distribution in this very massive cluster. In
this work, we aim to perform a comprehensive X-ray analysis of J0723 to obtain
accurate ICM hydrostatic mass measurements, using the X-ray data from
SRG/eROSITA and Chandra X-ray observatories. By comparing the hydrostatic mass
profile with the strong lensing model, we aim to provide the most reliable
constraint on the distribution of mass up to R500. Thanks to the eROSITA
all-sky survey and Chandra data, which provide high S/N and high angular
resolution respectively, we are able to constrain the ICM gas density profile
and temperature profile with good accuracy both in the core and to the
outskirts. With the density and temperature profiles, we compute the
hydrostatic mass profile, which is then projected along the line of sight to
compare with the mass distribution obtained from the recent strong lensing
analysis based on JWST data. We also deproject the strong lensing mass
distribution using the hydrostatic mass profile we obtained in this work. The
X-ray results obtained from eROSITA and Chandra agree very well with each
other. The hydrostatic mass profiles we measured in this work, both projected
and deprojected, are in good agreement with recent strong lensing results based

organizations were crucial in the development of a system that would offer
better services, be more transparent, and be more interoperable with other
networks. The aim of having a single set of standards for networks worldwide
was sadly not realized by the 2G network standards. The third generation (3G)
was born. It was called the universal terrestrial mobile system (UMTS), which
is European telecommunications standards institute (ETSI) driven. IMT-2000 is
the international telecommunication union-telecommunication standardization
sector (ITU-T) name for the 3G network. Wide-band code division multiple access
(WCDMA) is the air interface technology for the UMTS. This platform offers many
services that are based on the Internet, along with video calling, imaging,
etc. Further advancements to mobile network technology led to long term
evolution (LTE), a technology referred to as 4G. The primary goal of LTE was to
improve the speed and capacity of mobile networks while lowering latency. As we
move to an ALL-IP system, mobile networks' design becomes much simpler. LTE
uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in its air interface.
This paper details all mentioned mobile generations, as well as all the
differences between them in terms of hardware and software architectures.

for intelligent adaptive traffic signal controls is more than ever before. This
paper proposes a novel Economic-driven Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (eATSC)
model with a hyper control variable - interest rate defined in economics for
traffic signal control at signalized intersections. The eATSC uses a continuous
compounding function that captures both the total number of vehicles and the
accumulated waiting time of each vehicle to compute penalties for different
directions. The computed penalties grow with waiting time and is used for
signal control decisions. Each intersection is assigned two intelligent agents
adjusting interest rate and signal length for different directions according to
the traffic patterns, respectively. The problem is formulated as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) problem to reduce congestions, and a two-agent Double
Dueling Deep Q Network (DDDQN) is utilized to solve the problem. Under the
optimal policy, the agents can select the optimal interest rates and signal
time to minimize the likelihood of traffic congestion. To evaluate the
superiority of our method, a VISSIM simulation model with classic four-leg

the formation of exponential profiles in galaxy discs, but details on how a
star is moved around have not been fully explained. We use a GADGET-2
simulation where an exponential profile forms from an initially Gaussian disc
in about 4 Gyr for a low-mass galaxy like a dwarf irregular. We find that
nearly all large angular momentum changes of stars are caused by star-clump
encounters with the closest approach less than 0.5 kpc. During star-clump
encounters, stars may increase their random motions, resulting in an increase
in the average radial and vertical actions of the whole stellar population. The
angular momentum change and the radial action change of an individual star are
influenced by the direction from which the star approaches a clump. A star
initially at a higher galactic radius relative to the scattering clump usually
gets pulled inwards and loses its angular momentum during the encounter, and
one at a lower radius tends to shift outwards and gains angular momentum. The
increase in the radial action is the largest if a star encounters a clump from
the azimuthal direction, and is the smallest from a radial approach. The
angular momentum change due to encounters has an inward bias when the clump
profile has a steep radial decline, and a shallow decline can make the bias
outwards. The stellar profile evolution towards an exponential seems to occur
regardless of the direction of the bias.

  Despite this significant lack of information, we show that it is possible to
approximately maximize our utility up to an $O(\log n)$ factor. Formally, we
consider two different setups: the ""prophet"" setting, in which each $X_i$ is
independently drawn from some distribution $\mathcal{D}_i$, and the ""secretary""

algorithm also succeeds under an arbitrary permutation, if an estimate of the

generated with decoding algorithms such as greedy search, beam search, top-$k$

non-terminating sequences resulting from an incomplete decoding algorithm. We
first define an incomplete probable decoding algorithm which includes greedy

paintings on canvases by collaborating with a painter robot using simple inputs

innovations for computationally modeling a creative painting process. First, we
develop a fully differentiable simulation environment for painting, adopting
the idea of real to simulation to real (real2sim2real). We show that our
proposed simulated painting environment is higher fidelity to reality than
existing simulation environments used for robot painting. Second, to model the
evolving dynamics of a creative process, we develop a planning approach that
can continuously optimize the painting plan based on the evolving canvas with
respect to the high-level goals. In contrast to existing approaches where the
content generation process and action planning are performed independently and
sequentially, FRIDA adapts to the stochastic nature of using paint and a brush
by continually re-planning and re-assessing its semantic goals based on its
visual perception of the painting progress. We describe the details on the

In this paper, we focus on communication-efficient distributed (stochastic)
gradient descent for non-convex optimization, a driving force of FL. We propose
two algorithms, named {\em Adaptive Stochastic Sign SGD (Ada-StoSign)} and {\em
$\beta$-Stochastic Sign SGD ($\beta$-StoSign)}, each of which compresses the
local gradients into bit vectors.
  To handle unbounded gradients, Ada-StoSign uses a novel norm tracking
function that adaptively adjusts a coarse estimation on the $\ell_{\infty}$ of
the local gradients - a key parameter used in gradient compression. We show
that Ada-StoSign converges in expectation with a rate $O(\log T/\sqrt{T} +
1/\sqrt{M})$, where $M$ is the number of clients. To the best of our knowledge,
when $M$ is sufficiently large, Ada-StoSign outperforms the state-of-the-art
sign-based method whose convergence rate is $O(T^{-1/4})$. Under bounded
gradient assumption, $\beta$-StoSign achieves quantifiable Byzantine resilience
and privacy assurances, and works with partial client participation and
mini-batch gradients which could be unbounded. We corroborate and complement
our theories by experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Our results show that in most cases, the encoders of recent SOTA-performing

differences (MSTD) if $|A+A| > |A-A|$, has more differences than sums (MDTS) if
$|A+A| < |A-A|$, or is sum-difference balanced if $|A+A| = |A-A|$. A problem of
recent interest has been to understand the frequencies of these type of
subsets.
  The seventh author and Vissuet studied the problem for arbitrary finite
groups $G$ and proved that almost all subsets $A\subseteq G$ are sum-difference
balanced as $|G|\to\infty$. For the dihedral group $D_{2n}$, they conjectured
that of the remaining sets, most are MSTD, i.e., there are more MSTD sets than
MDTS sets. Some progress on this conjecture was made by Haviland et al. in
2020, when they introduced the idea of partitioning the subsets by size: if,
for each $m$, there are more MSTD subsets of $D_{2n}$ of size $m$ than MDTS
subsets of size $m$, then the conjecture follows.
  We extend the conjecture to generalized dihedral groups
$D=\mathbb{Z}_2\ltimes G$, where $G$ is an abelian group of size $n$ and the
nonidentity element of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ acts by inversion. We make further
progress on the conjecture by considering subsets with a fixed number of
rotations and reflections. By bounding the expected number of overlapping sums,
we show that the collection $\mathcal S_{D,m}$ of subsets of the generalized
dihedral group $D$ of size $m$ has more MSTD sets than MDTS sets when $6\le
m\le c_j\sqrt{n}$ for $c_j=1.3229/\sqrt{111+5j}$, where $j$ is the number of
elements in $G$ with order at most $2$. We also analyze the expectation for
$|A+A|$ and $|A-A|$ for $A\subseteq D_{2n}$, proving an explicit formula for
$|A-A|$ when $n$ is prime.

Despite the tight interaction of control and communications in WNCSs, most
existing works adopt separative design approaches. This is mainly because the
co-design of control-communication policies requires large and hybrid state and
action spaces, making the optimal problem mathematically intractable and
difficult to be solved effectively by classic algorithms. In this paper, we
systematically investigate deep learning (DL)-based estimator-control-scheduler
co-design for a model-unknown nonlinear WNCS over wireless fading channels. In
particular, we propose a co-design framework with the awareness of the sensor's

proposed for enhancing learning efficiency. We also develop novel schemes for
enhancing the stability of joint training. Extensive experiments demonstrate

developed new models using multi-view variational autoencoder (MVAE) for
feature representation learning and a product of expert (PoE) model for
multi-view information fusion. We applied the proposed models to an in-house
Louisiana Osteoporosis Study (LOS) cohort with 931 male subjects, including 345
African Americans and 586 Caucasians. With an analytical solution of the
product of Gaussian distribution, we adopted variational inference to train the
designed MVAE-PoE model to perform common latent feature extraction. We
performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to select 256 genetic variants
with the lowest p-values for each proximal femoral strength and integrated
whole genome sequence (WGS) features and DXA-derived imaging features to
predict proximal femoral strength. Results: The best prediction model for fall
fracture load was acquired by integrating WGS features and DXA-derived imaging
features. The designed models achieved the mean absolute percentage error of
18.04%, 6.84% and 7.95% for predicting proximal femoral fracture loads using
linear models of fall loading, nonlinear models of fall loading, and nonlinear
models of stance loading, respectively. Compared to existing multi-view
information fusion methods, the proposed MVAE-PoE achieved the best
performance. Conclusion: The proposed models are capable of predicting proximal
femoral strength using WGS features and DXA-derived imaging features. Though
this tool is not a substitute for FEA using QCT images, it would make improved
assessment of hip fracture risk more widely available while avoiding the
increased radiation dosage and clinical costs from QCT.

stochastic processes. Yet, various forms of gating mask first-passage times and
differentiate them from actual detection times. For instance, imperfect
conditions may intermittently gate our ability to observe a system of interest,
such that exact first-passage instances might be missed. In other cases, e.g.,
certain chemical reactions, direct observation of the molecules involved is
virtually impossible, but the reaction event itself can be detected. However,
this instance need not coincide with the first collision time since some
molecular encounters are infertile and hence gated. Motivated by the challenge
posed by such real-life situations we develop a universal -- model-free --
framework for the inference of first-passage times from the detection times of
gated first-passage processes. In addition, when the underlying laws of motions
are known, our framework also provides a way to infer physically meaningful
parameters, e.g. diffusion coefficients. Finally, we show how to infer the

two different relations on the monoid of manifolds under disjoint union. By
imposing both relations simultaneously, a cobordism cut and paste group
$\overline{\mathrm{SK}}_n$ is defined. In this paper, we extend this definition
to manifolds with boundary obtaining $\overline{\mathrm{SK}}^{\partial}_n$ and
study the relationship of this group to an appropriately defined cobordism

  hybrid accretion flows around black holes","17 pages, 7 figures, comments are welcome",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is a very popular two-zone accretion disk model that the inner part of
the non-advective Keplerian disk (Shakura-Sunyaev disk) can produce hot
advection-dominated accretion flow, which can generate high energy power-law
radiation and outflows/jets. However, we find that this simple model is
inadequate to automatically explain many properties of the sources (such as
hysteresis effect, counter-clockwise traversal in a hardness-intensity diagram,
peculiar variabilities, and association/non-association of jets in a black hole
$X-$ray binary) without considering additional assumptions. We also find some
theoretical issues in this model, such as understanding of variation of
transition region and formation of an outer disk, which has only Keplerian
distribution. Based on the recent theoretical studies on advective disk
structures, as well as, many observational behaviors of the accreting black
holes, we conclude that there should be a third component (TC) of accretion
flow parallel to the two-zone disk model, which can naturally explain all above
mentioned issues. Interestingly, this modified model also provides a new
scenario for the jet generation and evolution with the TC flow during high
energy states, which can make the jet close to the axis. We also find out an
expression of jet kinetic power.

dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) and 120 compiled reverberation-mapped (RM) AGN, we use $\sigma_{\rm
H\beta}$ and the extended $R_{\rm BLR}-L_{\rm 5100}$ relation to calculate
supermassive black holes masses ($M_{\rm BH}$) from the single-epoch spectra
for the SDSS subsample, and $\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$ from the mean spectra for the
RM subsample. We find a strong correlation between the relative optical Fe II
strength $R_{\rm Fe}$ and $\dot{\mathscr{M}}$ for the SDSS subsample with the
Spearman correlation coefficient $r_s$ of $0.727$, which is consistent with
that derived from the mean spectra for the RM subsample. The magnitude of
velocity shift of the optical Fe II emission has a strong anticorrelation with
$\dot{\mathscr{M}}$, whenever there is inflow or outflow. These strong
correlations show that the optical Fe II emission has an intimate connection
with the accretion process. Assuming that the difference of $M_{\rm BH}$ is due
to the variable virial factor $f$ for adopting $ \rm FWHM_{H\beta}$ as the
velocity tracer, we find that there is a relation between $f$ and $\rm
FWHM_{H\beta}$, $\log f=-(0.41\pm 0.002) \rm \log FWHM_{\rm H\beta}+(1.719\pm
0.009)$ for the single-epoch spectrum. The relation between $\log f$ and
$\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$ is not too strong, suggesting that $\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$
does not seem to depend much on the broad-line region inclination and a
constant $\sigma$-based $f$ is suitable for $\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$ as the

the frequency-integrated general relativistic radiative transfer equation is
solved in a photon number-conserving manner, and the isotropic and coherent

energy conservation of the radiation is also guaranteed. With the test

that the wavefront propagation in black hole space-time can be correctly solved

analysis is that the noise in stochastic first-order information has a finite
variance. Although this assumption covers all light-tailed (i.e.,
sub-exponential) and some heavy-tailed noise distributions (e.g., log-normal,
Weibull, and some Pareto distributions), it fails for many fat-tailed noise
distributions (i.e., ``heavier-tailed'' with potentially infinite variance)
that have been empirically observed in the FL literature. To date, it remains
unclear whether one can design convergent algorithms for FL systems that
experience fat-tailed noise. This motivates us to fill this gap in this paper
by proposing an algorithmic framework called FAT-Clipping (\ul{f}ederated
\ul{a}veraging with \ul{t}wo-sided learning rates and \ul{clipping}), which
contains two variants: FAT-Clipping per-round (FAT-Clipping-PR) and
FAT-Clipping per-iteration (FAT-Clipping-PI). Specifically, for the largest
$\alpha \in (1,2]$ such that the fat-tailed noise in FL still has a bounded
$\alpha$-moment, we show that both variants achieve
$\mathcal{O}((mT)^{\frac{2-\alpha}{\alpha}})$ and
$\mathcal{O}((mT)^{\frac{1-\alpha}{3\alpha-2}})$ convergence rates in the
strongly-convex and general non-convex settings, respectively, where $m$ and
$T$ are the numbers of clients and communication rounds. Moreover, at the
expense of more clipping operations compared to FAT-Clipping-PR,
FAT-Clipping-PI further enjoys a linear speedup effect with respect to the
number of local updates at each client and being lower-bound-matching (i.e.,
order-optimal). Collectively, our results advance the understanding of
designing efficient algorithms for FL systems that exhibit fat-tailed
first-order oracle information.

relaxation time have opposite effects on the electromagnetic response. While
the former suppresses the time-dependent conductivity, the latter enhances it.

CNN's ability to approximate wavefunctions by looking at the entanglement
spectrum captured by the size of the convolutional filter. Our insights reveal
the CNN to be an ansatz fundamentally centered around the occurrence statistics

shallow CNN ansatz with a unifying theoretical interpretation in terms of other
well-known statistical and physical ansatzes such as the maximum entropy

regression analysis, we find further relationships between the CNN's

in comparison to a spherical magnetic filler. The 3D distribution and
orientation of the magnetic filler was studied by computed tomography and
digital image analysis. The platelet-shaped particles align themselves
perpendicular to the buildup direction during the process, which offers a new
and cost-effective way of producing composites by LPBF with anisotropic
structural and functional properties. The influence of LPBF parameters on the
properties of the composites is investigated. Highest filling fractions are
required for high magnetic remanence, however the powder itself limits this
maximum due to particle shape and required minimal polymer fraction to form
mechanically stable magnets. The coercivity decreases for higher filling
fractions, which is attributed to increased rotation of insufficiently embedded
magnetic particles in the matrix. It is discussed how filler morphology
influences the observed change in coercivity since the rotation of spherical

orbital decay of a satellite galaxy embedded inside a dark matter halo but this
is not fully understood. Our goal is to assess if the orbital history of a
satellite remains unchanged during a concurrent sinking. For this purpose we
analyze the impact that the internal structure of the satellites and their
spatial distribution inside the host halo may have on the concurrent sinking
process due to both mass loss and the combined effect of self-friction, which
have not been studied before for concurrent sinking. We set up a set of N-body
simulations that include multiple satellites, sinking simultaneously in a host
halo and we compare them with models including a single satellite. The main
result of our work is that the satellite's accretion history differs from the
classical isolated view when we consider the collective effects. The accretion
history of each satellite strongly depends on the initial configuration, the
number of satellites in the halo at the time of infall and the internal
properties of each satellite. We observe that compact satellites in a flat
configuration fall slower than extended satellites that have lost mass, showing
a non-reported behavior of self-friction. We find that such effects are
maximized when satellites are located in a flat configuration. We show that in
a flat configuration similar to the Vast Polar Structure, deviations in the
apocenters can be of about 30% with respect to the isolated case, and up to 50%
on the eccentricities. We conclude that ignoring the collective effects
produced by the concurrent sinking of satellite galaxies may lead to large
errors in the determination of the merger progenitors properties, making it
considerably more challenging to trace back the accretion event. Timing
constrains on host density profile may be modified by the effects discussed
here.

spatiotemporal async-modelling approaches separately consider temporal and
spatial dependencies, resulting in weak generalization and large instability

the spatial signal passing and the temporal features simultaneously; 2) the
Long-term Temporal Strengthen model ($LT^2S$) for improving the stability of

excellent performances of fast convergence speed and low resource consumption

these approaches aim to extract important themes or topics in a textual corpus

general approach to the design of interactive machine learning systems in which
existing human professional processes can be used as the model for processes

first investigate the steps professionals go through when performing tasks and
design a workflow for Theme and Topic that integrates machine learning. We then
designed interfaces for topic modelling in which familiar concepts from

these the machine learning concepts more familiar and easier to learn for

secure quantum teleportation. In this paper, we study the generation of one-way
quantum steering between two distant yttrium iron garnet (YIG) microspheres in
chiral waveguide electromagonics. We consider that the magnon mode with the
Kerr nonlinearity in each YIG sphere is chirally coupled to left- and
right-propagating guided photons in the waveguide. We find that quantum
steering between the magnon modes is absent with non-chirality but is present
merely in the form of one way (i.e., one-way steering) when the chirality
occurs. The maximal achievable steering is obviously improved as the chirality
degree increases. We further find that when the waveguide's outputs are
subjected to continuous homodyne detection, the steering can be considerably
enhanced and asymmetric steering with strong entanglement can also be achieved
by tuning the chirality. Our study shows that chirality can be explored to
effectively realize one-way quantum steering. Compared to other studies on
achieving asymmetric steering via controlling intrinsic dissipation, e.g.
cavity loss rates, our scheme merely depends on the chirality enabled via
positioning the micromagnets in the waveguide and is continuously adjustable
and experimentally more feasible.

start the perturbation from a Hamiltonian that is classically hard to solve.
The proposed algorithm uses quantum signal processing (QSP) to achieve this
goal. Along with the perturbation theory, we construct a technique for ground
state preparation with detailed computational cost analysis, which can be of

for practical applications of QSP. Unfortunately, we find that the proposed
algorithm, at least in its current form, does not exhibit practical numbers

However, perturbation theory itself is an attractive direction to explore
because of its physical interpretability; it provides us insights about what
interaction gives an important contribution to the properties of systems. This

robotic task. Despite recent progress, existing methods primarily suffer from
two issues. First, most prior arts focus on a specific type of robot hand,
lacking the generalizable capability of handling unseen ones. Second, prior
arts oftentimes fail to rapidly generate diverse grasps with a high success
rate. To jointly tackle these challenges with a unified solution, we propose
GenDexGrasp, a novel hand-agnostic grasping algorithm for generalizable
grasping. GenDexGrasp is trained on our proposed large-scale multi-hand
grasping dataset MultiDex synthesized with force closure optimization. By
leveraging the contact map as a hand-agnostic intermediate representation,
GenDexGrasp efficiently generates diverse and plausible grasping poses with a
high success rate and can transfer among diverse multi-fingered robotic hands.
Compared with previous methods, GenDexGrasp achieves a three-way trade-off
among success rate, inference speed, and diversity. Code is available at

on off-road terrain. We use traversability measure to characterize the degree
of difficulty of navigation on the off-road terrain. The traversability measure
captures the property of terrain essential for navigation, such as elevation
map, terrain roughness, slope, and terrain texture. The terrain with the
presence or absence of obstacles becomes a particular case of the proposed
traversability measure. We provide a convex formulation to the off-road
navigation problem by lifting the problem to the density space using the linear
Perron-Frobenius (P-F) operator. The convex formulation leads to an
infinite-dimensional optimal navigation problem for control synthesis. The
finite-dimensional approximation of the infinite-dimensional convex problem is
constructed using data. We use a computational framework involving the Koopman
operator and the duality between the Koopman and P-F operator for the
data-driven approximation. This makes our proposed approach data-driven and can
be applied in cases where an explicit system model is unavailable. Finally, we
demonstrate the application of the developed framework for the navigation of
vehicle dynamics with Dubin's car model.

infrastructure that takes a large population from place A to B every day. To
achieve that, it is primarily designed for extreme functionality and
efficiency. However, in terms of experiential aesthetics, the metro is seldom
people s favourite place. When this modern infrastructure succeeds in serving
urban mobility with high performance and efficiency, passengers seem to want
more than the guaranteed functional performance. Recently, with the emergence
of VR technologies, increasing efforts from design and HCI communities look at
the value of VR technology in enhancing commuting experiences, bringing new
possibilities of interaction and activities, and potentially transforming
social public spaces. This study investigates how and why VR technology could
be integrated with a metro ride. We experimented with ten passengers by showing
them three 360 videos during their metro ride. The results show the narrative
driven scene is most desirable. Despite wearing a VR headset might cause
anxiety, our findings indicate a high level of acceptance towards VR
experiences based on the finding that it does not challenge the normative
behaviours of being a passenger inattentive in social, active in mind and
further can enhance the experience. As the takeaway, we propose three
strategies of VR content tailored for the metro context in which passengers
would find a role participating in the virtual scene and turn the scene to one
s own story, and at the same time, maintain physically constrained.

energy-based models) are difficult to train by maximizing the likelihood of the
data because the likelihood and/or gradients thereof cannot be explicitly or
efficiently written down. Score matching is a training method, whereby instead
of fitting the likelihood $\log p(x)$ for the training data, we instead fit the
score function $\nabla_x \log p(x)$ -- obviating the need to evaluate the
partition function. Though this estimator is known to be consistent, its
unclear whether (and when) its statistical efficiency is comparable to that of
maximum likelihood -- which is known to be (asymptotically) optimal. We
initiate this line of inquiry in this paper, and show a tight connection
between statistical efficiency of score matching and the isoperimetric
properties of the distribution being estimated -- i.e. the Poincar\'e,
log-Sobolev and isoperimetric constant -- quantities which govern the mixing
time of Markov processes like Langevin dynamics. Roughly, we show that the
score matching estimator is statistically comparable to the maximum likelihood
when the distribution has a small isoperimetric constant. Conversely, if the
distribution has a large isoperimetric constant -- even for simple families of
distributions like exponential families with rich enough sufficient statistics
-- score matching will be substantially less efficient than maximum likelihood.
We suitably formalize these results both in the finite sample regime, and in
the asymptotic regime. Finally, we identify a direct parallel in the discrete
setting, where we connect the statistical properties of pseudolikelihood
estimation with approximate tensorization of entropy and the Glauber dynamics.

an effective tool for node representations learning. An interesting way to
understand GCNs is to think of them as a message passing mechanism where each
node updates its representation by accepting information from its neighbours
(also known as positive samples). However, beyond these neighbouring nodes,
graphs have a large, dark, all-but forgotten world in which we find the
non-neighbouring nodes (negative samples). In this paper, we show that this
great dark world holds a substantial amount of information that might be useful
for representation learning. Most specifically, it can provide negative
information about the node representations. Our overall idea is to select
appropriate negative samples for each node and incorporate the negative
information contained in these samples into the representation updates.
Moreover, we show that the process of selecting the negative samples is not
trivial. Our theme therefore begins by describing the criteria for a good
negative sample, followed by a determinantal point process algorithm for
efficiently obtaining such samples. A GCN, boosted by diverse negative samples,
then jointly considers the positive and negative information when passing
messages. Experimental evaluations show that this idea not only improves the
overall performance of standard representation learning but also significantly
alleviates over-smoothing problems.

it learns a model under varying data distributions that generalizes to unseen

The advancement of this area is challenged by: 1) Difficulty in characterizing
spatial heterogeneity, and 2) Difficulty in obtaining predictive models for

proposes a generic framework for spatial domain generalization. Specifically,
We develop the spatial interpolation graph neural network that handles spatial

relationships. The spatial interpolation graph neural network infers the
spatial embedding of an unseen location during the test phase. Then the spatial
embedding of the target location is used to decode the parameters of the
downstream-task model directly on the target location. Finally, extensive

transit services. Still, this application needs live information on traffic
flow, accidents, events, and the location of the buses. Most cities lack the
infrastructure to provide these data. In this context, a bus arrival prediction
model is proposed for forecasting the arrival time using limited data sets. The
location data of public transit buses and spatial characteristics are used for
the study. One of the routes of Tumakuru city service, Tumakuru, India, is
selected and divided into two spatial patterns: sections with intersections and
sections without intersections. The machine learning model XGBoost is modeled
for both spatial patterns individually. A model to dynamically predict bus

learning model to estimate the arrival time at a downstream bus stop. The
performance of models is compared based on the R-squared values of the
predictions made, and the proposed model established superior results. It is
suggested to predict bus arrival in the study area. The proposed model can also

assumption in the system. The Markovian lift was effectively used to discretize
the system into a finite-dimensional process, which is easier to analyze. The
resolution of the problem is based on backward Kolmogorov equations and a
quadratic solution ansatz. The control problem has a closed-form solution, and
the variance has both strict upper and lower bounds, indicating that the
variance cannot take an arbitrary value even when it is subject to a high

either acquiring paired ground-truth high-quality (HQ) images or synthesizing
photo-realistic degraded LQ observations. Recent works mainly focus on modeling
the degradation with handcrafted or estimated degradation parameters, which are
however incapable to model complicated real-world degradation types, resulting
in limited quality improvement. Notably, LQ face images, which may have the
same degradation process as natural images, can be robustly restored with
photo-realistic textures by exploiting their strong structural priors. This
motivates us to use the real-world LQ face images and their restored HQ
counterparts to model the complex real-world degradation (namely ReDegNet), and
then transfer it to HQ natural images to synthesize their realistic LQ
counterparts. By taking these paired HQ-LQ face images as inputs to explicitly
predict the degradation-aware and content-independent representations, we could
control the degraded image generation, and subsequently transfer these
degradation representations from face to natural images to synthesize the
degraded LQ natural images. Experiments show that our ReDegNet can well learn
the real degradation process from face images. The restoration network trained
with our synthetic pairs performs favorably against SOTAs. More importantly,
our method provides a new way to handle the real-world complex scenarios by
learning their degradation representations from the facial portions, which can
be used to significantly improve the quality of non-facial areas. The source

important challenge. Safe Bayesian optimization (BO) quantifies uncertainty in
the objective and constraints to safely guide exploration in such settings.
Hand-designing a suitable probabilistic model can be challenging, however. In
the presence of unknown safety constraints, it is crucial to choose reliable
model hyper-parameters to avoid safety violations. Here, we propose a
data-driven approach to this problem by meta-learning priors for safe BO from
offline data. We build on a meta-learning algorithm, F-PACOH, capable of
providing reliable uncertainty quantification in settings of data scarcity. As
core contribution, we develop a novel framework for choosing safety-compliant
priors in a data-riven manner via empirical uncertainty metrics and a frontier
search algorithm. On benchmark functions and a high-precision motion system, we
demonstrate that our meta-learned priors accelerate the convergence of safe BO
approaches while maintaining safety.

may cause information dilution from registered features during the decoding

and a recurrent prediction enhancement module (RPEM) to reinforce the prototype
learning paradigm and build a unified memory-augmented decoder for few-shot
segmentation, respectively. Specifically, the RPGM combines superpixel and
K-means clustering to generate rich prototype features with complementary scale
relationships and adapt the scale gap between support and query images. The
RPEM utilizes the recurrent mechanism to design a round-way propagation
decoder. In this way, registered features can provide object-aware information
continuously. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms other
competitors on two popular benchmarks PASCAL-${{5}^{i}}$ and COCO-${{20}^{i}}$.

with the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1), yielding 49 hours of good
quality data. In addition, we analyzed 12 years of Fermi-LAT data, to better
constrain emission of its High-Energy (HE) counterpart 4FGL J2108.0+5155. We
found an excess (3.7 sigma) in the LST-1 data at energies E > 3 TeV. Further
analysis in the whole LST-1 energy range assuming a point-like source, resulted
in a hint (2.2 sigma) of hard emission which can be described with a single
power law with photon index Gamma = 1.6 +- 0.2 between 0.3 - 100 TeV. We did
not find any significant extended emission which could be related to a
Supernova Remnant (SNR) or Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) in the XMM-Newton data,
which puts strong constraints on possible synchrotron emission of relativistic
electrons. The LST-1 and LHAASO observations can be explained as inverse
Compton-dominated leptonic emission of relativistic electrons with a cutoff
energy of $100^{+70}_{-30}$ TeV. The low magnetic field in the source imposed
by the X-ray upper limits on synchrotron emission is compatible with a
hypothesis of a PWN or a TeV halo. The lack of a pulsar in the neighborhood of
the UHE source is a challenge to the PWN/TeV-halo scenario. The UHE gamma rays
can also be explained as $\pi^0$ decay-dominated hadronic emission due to
interaction of relativistic protons with one of the two known molecular clouds
in the direction of the source. The hard spectrum in the LST-1 band is
compatible with protons escaping a shock around a middle-aged SNR because of
their high low-energy cut-off.

typically done on substrates seeded with diamond nanoparticles. Specular laser
reflectance and a continuous film model have been used to monitor the thickness
of these films during their deposition. However, most seeds are isolated during
the early stages of the deposition, which questions the utility of applying
such a continuous film model for monitoring deposition before film formation.
In this work, we present a model based on the Rayleigh theory of scattering for
laser reflectance at substrates with growing nanodiamonds to capture the early
stages of PCD deposition. The reflectance behavior predicted by our model
differs from that of a continuous film, which is well-described by the
continuous film model. This difference enlarges as the seed density used in our
model decreases. We verify this trend experimentally by depositing diamond
under identical conditions on substrates with various seed densities. A
relation derived from our model is used to fit reflectance data from which seed
densities are obtained that are proportional to those found with electron
microscopy. We also show that relying on the continuous film model for
describing the early stages of deposition can result in falsely deducing the
existence of incubation, and that the continuous film model can be used safely
beyond the early stages of deposition. Based on these findings, we delineate a
robust method for obtaining growth rates and incubation periods from
reflectance measurements. This work may also advance the general understanding
of nanoparticle growth and formation.

ring coded modulation of $2^{m}$-PAM signaling. With it, the integer sum of
multiple codewords belongs to the $n$-dimension lattice of the base code. Such
property enables efficient \textit{algebraic binning} for computing linear
combinations of $K$ users' messages. For the receiver, we devise two new
algorithms, based on linear physical-layer network coding and linear filtering,
to calculate the symbol-wise a posteriori probabilities (APPs) w.r.t. the $K$
streams of linear codeword combinations. The resultant APP streams are
forwarded to the $q$-ary belief-propagation decoders, which parallelly compute
$K$ streams of linear message combinations. Finally, by multiplying the inverse
of the coefficient matrix, all users' messages are recovered. Even with
single-stage parallel processing, LCMA is shown to support a remarkably larger
number of users and exhibits improved frame error rate (FER) relative to
existing NOMA systems such as IDMA and SCMA. Further, we propose a new
multi-stage LCMA receiver relying on \emph{generalized matrix inversion}. With
it, a near-capacity performance is demonstrated for a wide range of system

be improved by combining a Brownian bridge technique and a conditional Monte
Carlo method provided that the running minimum $\inf_{t\in[0,T]}X_t$ has a
bounded density in the vicinity of the barrier.
  In the present work, thanks to the Lamperti transformation technique and
using a Brownian interpolation of the drift implicit Euler scheme of Alfonsi
[2], we show that the efficiency of the MLMC can be also improved for the
evaluation of barrier options for models with non-Lipschitz diffusion
coefficients under certain moment constraints. We study two example models: the
Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) and the Constant of Elasticity of Variance (CEV)
processes for which we show that the conditions of our theoretical framework
are satisfied under certain restrictions on the models parameters. In
particular, we develop semi-explicit formulas for the densities of the running
minimum and running maximum of both CIR and CEV processes which are of
independent interest. Finally, numerical tests are processed to illustrate our
results.

Adapter have also been successfully applied to the vision domain. However,
prefix-tuning remains under-explored for vision tasks. In this work, we intend
to adapt large vision models (LVMs) to downstream tasks with a good
parameter-accuracy trade-off. Towards this goal, we propose a framework with a
unified view of PETL called visual-PETL (V-PETL) to investigate the effects of
different PETL techniques, data scales of downstream domains, positions of
trainable parameters, and other aspects affecting the trade-off. Specifically,
we analyze the positional importance of trainable parameters and differences
between NLP and vision tasks in terms of data structures and pre-training

under-explored prefix-tuning technique. Based on a comprehensive understanding
of the differences between NLP and vision data, we propose a new variation of
the prefix-tuning module called parallel attention (PATT) for vision downstream
tasks. An extensive empirical analysis on vision tasks via different frozen
LVMs has been carried and the findings show that the proposed PATT can
effectively contribute to other PETL techniques. An effective scheme Swin-BAPAT
derived from the proposed V-PETL framework achieves significantly better

parameterized with formal grammars (viz. semi-Thue systems) that operate by
propagating formulae and/or checking if data exists along certain paths within
a nested sequent, where paths are encoded as strings generated by a
parameterizing grammar. Regarding the latter device, structural refinement is a
relatively new methodology used to extract nested sequent systems from labeled
systems (which are ultimately obtained from a semantics) by means of
eliminating structural/relational rules, introducing reachability rules, and
then carrying out a notational translation. We therefore demonstrate how this
method can be extended to the setting of first-order modal logics, and expose
how reachability rules naturally arise from applying this method.

State-of-the-art reinforcement-learning-based methods can then be trained using
less overall simulated experience. We compare its performance with the popular

increases of success rates of approximately 10% on the most complex 3D
rotations with respect to the success rates obtained by HER trained in an

(LAT) onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (hereafter Fermi-LAT)
observed a peak $\gamma-$ray (0.1$-$500 GeV) flux of $\sim$2 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$
photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ within a single orbit on 2021 April 27, which is
historically the brightest $\gamma-$ray flux ever detected from the source.
Here, we report, for the first time, the detection of significant
minute-timescale GeV $\gamma-$ray flux variability in the BL Lac subclass of
blazars by the Fermi-LAT. We resolved the source variability down to 2-min
binned timescales with a flux halving time of $\sim$1 minute, which is the
shortest GeV variability timescale ever observed from blazars. The detected
variability timescale is much shorter than the light-crossing time ($\sim 14$
minutes) across the central black hole of BL Lac indicating a very compact
$\gamma-$ray emission site within the outflowing jet. Such a compact emitting
region requires the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet to be larger than 16 so that
the jet power is not super Eddington. We found a minimum Doppler factor
$\delta_{min}$ of 15 using the $\delta$ function approximation for the
$\gamma\gamma$ opacity constraint. For a conical jet geometry, considering
$\Gamma = \delta_{min}$, the observed short variability timescale suggests the
very compact emission region to lie at a distance of about 8.62 $\times$
10$^{14}$ cm from the central engine of BL Lac.

controllers to maintain stack temperatures around set points. However, heat
transfer delays in electrolysis systems cause manual tuning of PID temperature
controllers to be time-consuming, and temperature oscillations often occur.
This paper focuses on the design of the PID temperature controller for an
alkaline electrolysis system to achieve fast and stable temperature control. A
thermal dynamic model of an electrolysis system is established in the
frequency-domain for controller designs. Based on this model, the temperature
stability is analysed by the root distribution, and the PID parameters are
optimized considering both the temperature overshoot and the settling time. The
performance of the optimal PID controllers is verified through experiments.
Furthermore, the simulation results show that the before-stack temperature
should be used as the feedback variable for small lab-scale systems to suppress
stack temperature fluctuations, and the after-stack temperature should be used
for larger systems to improve the economy. This study is helpful in ensuring
the temperature stability and control of electrolysis systems.

greater than the sum of the individual drugs' effect. While cell line data
measuring the effect of single drugs are readily available, there is relatively
less comparable data on drug synergy given the vast amount of possible drug
combinations. Thus, there is interest to use computational approaches to
predict drug synergy for untested pairs of drugs.
  Methods: We introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based model for drug
synergy prediction, which utilizes drug chemical structures and cell line gene
expression data. We use information from the largest drug combination database
available (DrugComb), combining drug synergy scores in order to construct high
confidence benchmark datasets.
  Results: Our proposed solution for drug synergy predictions offers a number
of benefits: 1) It utilizes a combination of 34 distinct drug synergy datasets
to learn on a wide variety of drugs and cell lines representations. 2) It is
trained on constructed high confidence benchmark datasets. 3) It learns
task-specific drug representations, instead of relying on generalized and
pre-computed chemical drug features. 4) It achieves similar or better
prediction performance (AUPR scores ranging from 0.777 to 0.964) compared to
state-of-the-art baseline models when tested on various benchmark datasets.
  Conclusions: We demonstrate that a GNN based model can provide

robotic manipulators. In this study, we propose a novel model-free
reinforcement learning approach based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) for
training a deep policy to map the task space to the joint space of a 6-DoF
manipulator. To facilitate the training process in a large workspace, we
develop an efficient representation of environmental inputs and outputs. The
calculation of the distance between obstacles and manipulator links is
incorporated into the state representation using a geometry-based method.
Additionally, to enhance the performance of the model in reaching tasks, we
introduce the action ensembles method and design the policy to directly
participate in value function updates in PPO. To overcome the challenges
associated with training in real-robot environments, we develop a simulation
environment in Gazebo to train the model as it produces a smaller Sim-to-Real
gap compared to other simulators. However, training in Gazebo is
time-intensive. To address this issue, we propose a Sim-to-Sim method to
significantly reduce the training time. The trained model is then directly
applied in a real-robot setup without fine-tuning. To evaluate the performance
of the proposed approach, we perform several rounds of experiments in both
simulated and real robots. We also compare the performance of the proposed
approach with six baselines. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in performing reaching tasks with and
without obstacles. our method outperformed the selected baselines by a large
margin in different reaching task scenarios. A video of these experiments has

finding the optimal asset allocation that maximizes expected returns while
minimizing risk. When assets are allocated in discrete units, this is a
combinatorial optimization problem that can be addressed by quantum and
quantum-inspired algorithms. In this work we present an integer simulated
annealing method to find optimal portfolios in the presence of discretized
convex and non-convex cost functions. Our algorithm can deal with large size
portfolios with hundreds of assets. We introduce a performance metric, the time
to target, based on a lower bound to the cost function obtained with the
continuous relaxation of the combinatorial optimization problem. This metric
allows us to quantify the time required to achieve a solution with a given
quality. We carry out numerical experiments and we benchmark the algorithm in
two situations: (i) Monte Carlo instances are started at random, and (ii) the
algorithm is warm-started with an initial instance close to the continuous
relaxation of the problem. We find that in the case of warm-starting with
convex cost functions, the time to target does not grow with the size of the
optimization problem, so discretized versions of convex portfolio optimization
problems are not hard to solve using classical resources. We have applied our
method to the problem of re-balancing in the presence of non-convex transaction
costs, and we have found that our algorithm can efficiently minimize those

algorithms require to be trained on many well annotated examples to achieve

requires human supervision which makes it expensive in terms of time and costs.
A possible solution to reduce these costs consist in exploiting tools to
automatically generate synthetic labeled images from a 3D model of the site.
However, models trained with synthetic data do not generalize on real images
acquired in the target scenario in which they are supposed to be used.
Furthermore, object detectors should be able to work with different wearable
devices or different mobile devices, which makes generalization even harder. In
this paper, we present a new dataset collected in a cultural site to study the
problem of domain adaptation for object detection in the presence of multiple
unlabeled target domains corresponding to different cameras and a labeled

affected by the overall reviewers' ratings, feedback, etc. Moreover, the

in supergravity theories where supersymmetry is spontaneously broken. In the
unitary gauge, the gravitino becomes massive (of mass $m_{3/2}$) by absorbing
the Goldstino, and the scattering amplitudes of its longitudinal polarisations
grow with energy as $\kappa^2 E^4/m_{3/2}^2$, signaling a potential breakdown
of unitarity at a scale $\Lambda^2\sim m_{3/2}/\kappa\sim M_{\mathrm{SUSY}}^2$.
As we show explicitly in the Polonyi model, this leading term is cancelled by
the contributions coming from the scalar partner of the Goldstino (sgoldstino),
restoring perturbative unitarity up to the Planck scale. This is expected since
supersymmetry is spontaneously broken, in analogy with the situation occuring
in the Standard Model, where massive gauge bosons scattering preserves
unitarity at high energy once we consider the contributions from the Higgs
boson. However, when supersymmetry is broken by the new Fayet-Iliopoulos
$D$-term, with ungauged R-symmetry, the above cancellation does not occur. In
this case, the unbroken phase is singular and there is no contribution able to
cancel the quartic divergences of the amplitudes, leading to a cutoff
$\Lambda\sim M_\mathrm{SUSY}$ where the effective theory breaks down. The same
behaviour is obtained when supersymmetry is non-linearly realised.

tunnelling process separately. The cluster-daughter interaction potential is
obtained by folding the relativistic mean-field (RMF) densities with the
recently developed microscopic R3Y using the NL$3^*$ and the phenomenological
M3Y NN potentials to compare their adaptability. The penetration probabilities
are calculated from the WKB approximation. With the inclusion of the new
preformation probability $P_0$, the predicted half-lives from the R3Y and M3Y
interactions are in good agreement with the experimental data. Furthermore, a
careful inspection reflects slight differences in the decay half-lives, which
arise from their respective barrier properties. The $P_0$ for the systems with
the double magic shell closure $^{208}$Pb daughter are found to be relatively
higher with an order of $\approx 10^2$ than those with neighbouring Pb-daughter
nuclei. By exploring the contributions of the decay energy, the recoil effect
of the daughter nucleus is appraised, unlike several other conjectures. Thus,
the centrality of the Q-value in the decay process is demonstrated and
re-defined within the preformed cluster-decay model. Besides, we have
introduced a simple and intuitive set of criteria that governs the estimation
of recoil energy in the cluster radioactivity.

manual expertise to automated systems, often using deep learning (DL) systems.
The performance of deep learning algorithms is highly dependent on data
quality. Particularly for the medical domain, it is an important aspect as
medical data is very sensitive to quality and poor quality can lead to
misdiagnosis. To improve the diagnostic performance, research has been done
both in complex DL architectures and in improving data quality using dataset
dependent static hyperparameters. However, the performance is still constrained
due to data quality and overfitting of hyperparameters to a specific dataset.
To overcome these issues, this paper proposes random data augmentation based
enhancement. The main objective is to develop a generalized, data-independent
and computationally efficient enhancement approach to improve medical data
quality for DL. The quality is enhanced by improving the brightness and
contrast of images. In contrast to the existing methods, our method generates
enhancement hyperparameters randomly within a defined range, which makes it
robust and prevents overfitting to a specific dataset. To evaluate the
generalization of the proposed method, we use four medical datasets and compare
its performance with state-of-the-art methods for both classification and
segmentation tasks. For grayscale imagery, experiments have been performed
with: COVID-19 chest X-ray, KiTS19, and for RGB imagery with: LC25000 datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that with the proposed enhancement
methodology, DL architectures outperform other existing methods. Our code is

and efficient pre-training paradigm that consists of various SSL components,
including but not limited to contrastive alignment, data recovery from

challenge is to model the interference in those channels to enable proper

equipped with a Local REM that is updated on the basis of raw interference
samples and previous interference model stored in the Global REM. The model in
global REM is obtained by merging models reported by platoons. The nodes
exchange only parameters of interference models, reducing the required control

flexibility to encode problem-dependent knowledge. Empirical results on several

insolation, and the lower atmospheric dust are the dominant forcings of the

analysis, is developed to quantify the contributions of the dominant forcings
to the densities and temperatures. The results of the present study show that a
100 sfu (solar flux units) change in the solar activity results in approx. 136
K corresponding change in the thermospheric temperatures. The solar insolation
constrains the seasonal, latitudinal, and diurnal variations to be
interdependent. Diurnal variation dominates the solar insolation variability,
followed by the latitudinal and seasonal variations. Both the global and
regional dust storms lead to considerable enhancements in the densities and
temperatures of the Martian thermosphere. Using past data of the solar fluxes
and the dust optical depths, the state of the Martian thermosphere is
extrapolated back to Martian year (MY) 24. While the global dust storms of MY
25, MY 28 and MY 34 raise the thermospheric temperatures by approx. 22-38 K,
the regional dust storm of MY 34 leads to approx. 15 K warming. Dust driven
thermospheric temperatures alone can enhance the hydrogen escape fluxes by
1.67-2.14 times compared to those without the dust. Dusts effects are
relatively significant for global dust storms that occur in solar minimum

Therefore, they are unable to follow fast events and use efficiently the

decrease this space while providing an accurate state of the simulation at any

relative accuracy for all the particles. The outputs consist of a single file
representing the full evolution of the simulation. Within this file, the

67.8x for the same storage space whilst retaining an acceptable reading speed

Jacobian of a certain equation-system derived from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions of the NSDP is nonsingular at a KKT point under the second-order
sufficient condition (SOSC), the strict complementarity condition (SC), and the
nondegeneracy condition (NC). This yields uniqueness and existence of the
central path through the implicit function theorem. In this paper, we consider
the following three assumptions on a KKT point: the strong SOSC, the SC, and
the Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification. Under the absence of the
NC, the Lagrange multiplier set is not necessarily a singleton and the
nonsingularity of the above-mentioned Jacobian is no longer valid. Nonetheless,
we establish that the central path exists uniquely, and moreover prove that the
dual component of the path converges to the so-called analytic center of the
Lagrange multiplier set. As another notable result, we clarify a region around
the central path where Newton's equations relevant to primal-dual interior
point methods are uniquely solvable.

according to the style of a target domain. One important, desired
characteristic of these transformations, is their graduality, which corresponds
to a smooth change between the source and the target image when their
respective latent-space representations are linearly interpolated. However,
state-of-the-art methods usually perform poorly when evaluated using
inter-domain interpolations, often producing abrupt changes in the appearance
or non-realistic intermediate images. In this paper, we argue that one of the
main reasons behind this problem is the lack of sufficient inter-domain
training data and we propose two different regularization methods to alleviate
this issue: a new shrinkage loss, which compacts the latent space, and a Mixup
data-augmentation strategy, which flattens the style representations between
domains. We also propose a new metric to quantitatively evaluate the degree of
the interpolation smoothness, an aspect which is not sufficiently covered by
the existing I2I translation metrics. Using both our proposed metric and
standard evaluation protocols, we show that our regularization techniques can
improve the state-of-the-art multi-domain I2I translations by a large margin.
Our code will be made publicly available upon the acceptance of this article.

computer vision literature, however, training ViTs for RGB-D object recognition
remains an understudied topic, viewed in recent literature only through the
lens of multi-task pretraining in multiple vision modalities. Such approaches
are often computationally intensive, relying on the scale of multiple
pretraining datasets to align RGB with 3D information. In this work, we propose
a simple yet strong recipe for transferring pretrained ViTs in RGB-D domains
for 3D object recognition, focusing on fusing RGB and depth representations
encoded jointly by the ViT. Compared to previous works in multimodal
Transformers, the key challenge here is to use the attested flexibility of ViTs
to capture cross-modal interactions at the downstream and not the pretraining
stage. We explore which depth representation is better in terms of resulting
accuracy and compare early and late fusion techniques for aligning the RGB and
depth modalities within the ViT architecture. Experimental results in the
Washington RGB-D Objects dataset (ROD) demonstrate that in such RGB -> RGB-D
scenarios, late fusion techniques work better than most popularly employed
early fusion. With our transfer baseline, fusion ViTs score up to 95.4% top-1
accuracy in ROD, achieving new state-of-the-art results in this benchmark. We
further show the benefits of using our multimodal fusion baseline over unimodal
feature extractors in a synthetic-to-real visual adaptation as well as in an
open-ended lifelong learning scenario in the ROD benchmark, where our model
outperforms previous works by a margin of >8%. Finally, we integrate our method

medical science, psychology, social science, etc. The phenomenal growth of the

systematic approach to develop efficient clustering methods and scalable
algorithmic implementations. On the other hand, there is abundant literature on
the cluster analysis of time series, trajectory data, spatio-temporal data,
etc., which are all related to functional data. Therefore, an overarching
structure of existing functional data clustering methods will enable the
cross-pollination of ideas across various research fields. We here conduct a
comprehensive review of original clustering methods for functional data. We
propose a systematic taxonomy that explores the connections and differences
among the existing functional data clustering methods and relates them to the
conventional multivariate clustering methods. The structure of the taxonomy is
built on three main attributes of a functional data clustering method and
therefore is more reliable than existing categorizations. The review aims to
bridge the gap between the functional data analysis community and the
clustering community and to generate new principles for functional data

probe this sensitive field response by confining a NF fluid in microchannels
that connect electrodes through straight and curved paths. We find that by
applying electric fields as low as E c.a. 0.5 V/mm, the NF phase orders with
its polarization smoothly following the winding paths of the channels even when
oriented antiparallel to the line connecting positive to negative electrodes,
implying analogous behavior of the electric field. Upon inversion of E, the
polar order undergoes a complex multistage switching process dominated by
electrostatic interactions. Multistage polarization switching dynamics is also
found in numerical simulations of a quasi-2D continuum model of NF liquid
crystals in microchannels, which also clarify the conditions under which the
electric field is guided by the microchannels. Experiments and theory indicate
that all observations are direct consequences of the prompt effective screening
of electric field components normal to the channel walls. This electric

However, keeping a healthy lifestyle is still challenging for most people as it
is difficult to recognize their living behaviors and identify their surrounding

promising approach to building a behavior model of users, by which users can
get feedback about their habits and be encouraged to develop a healthier
lifestyle. In this paper, we present a smart light wearable badge with six
kinds of sensors, including an infrared array sensor MLX90640 offering
privacy-preserving, low-cost, and non-invasive features, to recognize daily
activities in a realistic unmodified kitchen environment. A multi-channel
convolutional neural network (MC-CNN) based on data and feature fusion methods
is applied to classify 14 human activities associated with potentially
unhealthy habits. Meanwhile, we evaluate the impact of the infrared array

  Style Transfer","Accepted by WACV 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Domain generalization (DG) has been a hot topic in image recognition, with a
goal to train a general model that can perform well on unseen domains.
Recently, federated learning (FL), an emerging machine learning paradigm to
train a global model from multiple decentralized clients without compromising
data privacy, brings new challenges, also new possibilities, to DG. In the FL
scenario, many existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) DG methods become ineffective,
because they require the centralization of data from different domains during
training. In this paper, we propose a novel domain generalization method for
image recognition under federated learning through cross-client style transfer
(CCST) without exchanging data samples. Our CCST method can lead to more
uniform distributions of source clients, and thus make each local model learn
to fit the image styles of all the clients to avoid the different model biases.
Two types of style (single image style and overall domain style) with
corresponding mechanisms are proposed to be chosen according to different
scenarios. Our style representation is exceptionally lightweight and can hardly
be used for the reconstruction of the dataset. The level of diversity is also
flexible to be controlled with a hyper-parameter. Our method outperforms recent
SOTA DG methods on two DG benchmarks (PACS, OfficeHome) and a large-scale
medical image dataset (Camelyon17) in the FL setting. Last but not least, our
method is orthogonal to many classic DG methods, achieving additive performance
by combined utilization.

that the main energy dissipation mechanisms are the tangential frictions
between particles in contact, namely, rolling, sliding, and twisting. However,
there is a large uncertainty for the strength of rolling friction, and the
dependence of the collisional growth condition on the strength of rolling
friction was poorly understood. Here we performed numerical simulations of
collisions between two equal-mass porous aggregates with various collision
velocities and impact parameters, and we also changed the strength of rolling
friction systematically. We found that the threshold of the collision velocity
for the fragmentation of dust aggregates is nearly independent of the strength
of rolling friction. This is because the total amount of the energy dissipation

analyzing the impact of higher statistical cumulants of entropy production
within a general framework of time-symmetrically controlled computation. This
allows us to derive an exact expression for the current that achieves the
minimum scaled variance, for which the TUR bound tightens to an equality that
we name Thermodynamic Uncertainty Theorem (TUT). Importantly, both the minimum
scaled variance current and the TUT are functionals of the stochastic entropy
production, thus retaining the impact of its higher moments. In particular, our
results show that, beyond the average, the entropy production distribution's
higher moments have a significant effect on any current's precision. This is
made explicit via a thorough numerical analysis of swap and reset computations
that quantitatively compares the TUT against previous generalized TURs. Our
results demonstrate how to interpolate between previously-established bounds
and how to identify the most relevant TUR bounds in different nonequilibrium
regimes.

many studies have tackled this problem. In contrast, relatively few works have
considered predicate similarities as a unique dataset feature which also leads
to the biased prediction. Due to the feature, infrequent predicates (e.g.,

classification scheme that branches the process to several fine-grained
classifiers for similar predicate groups. The classifiers aim to capture the
differences among similar predicates in detail. We also introduce the idea of
transfer learning to enhance the features for the predicates which lack
sufficient training samples to learn the descriptive representations. The
results of extensive experiments on the Visual Genome dataset show that the
combination of our method and an existing debiasing approach greatly improves
performance on tail predicates in challenging SGCls/SGDet tasks. Nonetheless,
the overall performance of the proposed approach does not reach that of the

passivates the defects of monolayer WS2 by anchoring the adsorbed oxygen atoms
onto monolayer WS2 crystals. Due to defect passivation by h-BN encapsulation,
the excess electron density in monolayer WS2 crystals is greatly lowered and
stabilized, resulting in two orders of magnitude lower exciton annihilation by

addition to segmenting target regions even when large portions of the input are

However, single-view pose estimation is inherently limited by depth ambiguity
and ambiguities imposed by various phenomena like occlusion, self-occlusion,
reflections, etc. Aggregation of information from multiple views can
potentially resolve these ambiguities, but the current state-of-the-art
multi-view pose estimation method only uses multiple views to aggregate
single-view pose estimates, and thus rely on obtaining good single-view
estimates. We present a multi-view pose estimation method which aggregates
learned 2D-3D distributions from multiple views for both the initial estimate
and optional refinement. Our method performs probabilistic sampling of 3D-3D
correspondences under epipolar constraints using learned 2D-3D correspondence
distributions which are implicitly trained to respect visual ambiguities such
as symmetry. Evaluation on the T-LESS dataset shows that our method reduces
pose estimation errors by 80-91% compared to the best single-view method, and
we present state-of-the-art results on T-LESS with four views, even compared

However, the strict energy budget of application-specific integrated
circuit-based DSP chips has prevented the deployment of some powerful but
computationally costly DSP algorithms. As a result, fiber nonlinearity-induced
signal distortions impede fiber communications systems, especially in
wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) transmission systems. To solve these
challenges, photonics hardware (i.e., photonic neural networks) promises to
break performance limitations in electronics and gain advantages in bandwidth,
latency, and power consumption in solving intellectual tasks that are
unreachable by conventional digital electronic platforms. This work proposes a
photonic recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of simultaneously resolving
dispersion and both intra and inter-channel fiber nonlinearities in multiple
WDM channels in the photonic domain, for the first time to our best knowledge.
Furthermore, our photonic RNN can directly process optical WDM signals in the
photonic domain, avoiding prohibitive energy consumption and speed overhead in
analog to digital converters (ADC). We demonstrate in simulation that our
photonic RNN can process multiple WDM channels simultaneously and achieve a
reduced bit error rate compared to typical DSP algorithms for all WDM channels
in a pulse-amplitude modulation 4-level (PAM4) transmission system, thanks to
its unique capability to address inter-channel fiber nonlinearities. In
addition to signal quality performance, the proposed system also promises to
significantly reduce the power consumption and the latency compared to the

discs where accretion occurs mainly because of disc winds and where the planet
luminosity is generated by pebble accretion. Using 2D hydrodynamical
simulations, we determine the eccentricities induced by thermal forces as a
function of gas and pebble accretion rates, and also evaluate the importance of
the torque exerted by the solid component relative to the gas torque. For a gas
accretion rate $\dot M= 2\times 10^{-8}$ $M_\odot/$yr and pebble flux $\dot
M_{peb}=170$ $M_\oplus$/Myr, we find that embryo eccentricities attain values
comparable to the disc aspect ratio. The planet radial excursion in the disc,
however, causes the torque exerted by inflowing pebbles to cancel on average
and migration to transition from outward to inward. This is found to arise
because the magnitude of thermal torques decreases exponentially with
increasing eccentricity, and we provide a fitting formula for the thermal
torque attenuation as a function of eccentricity. As the disc evolves, the
accretion luminosity becomes at some point too small to make the core
eccentricity grow such that the solid component can exert a non-zero torque on
the planet. This torque is positive and for gas accretion rates $\dot M
\lesssim 5\times 10^{-9}$ $M_\odot/$yr and pebble fluxes $\dot M_{peb} \lesssim
120$ $M_\oplus/$Myr, it is found to overcome the gas torque exerted on cores

advantage over CNNs that they do not waste network capacity on training
symmetries that should have been hard-coded in the network. The recently
introduced framework of PDE-based G-CNNs (PDE-G-CNNs) generalises G-CNNs.
PDE-G-CNNs have the core advantages that they simultaneously 1) reduce network
complexity, 2) increase classification performance, and 3) provide geometric
interpretability. Their implementations primarily consist of linear and
morphological convolutions with kernels.
  In this paper we show that the previously suggested approximative
morphological kernels do not always accurately approximate the exact kernels
accurately. More specifically, depending on the spatial anisotropy of the
Riemannian metric, we argue that one must resort to sub-Riemannian
approximations. We solve this problem by providing a new approximative kernel
that works regardless of the anisotropy. We provide new theorems with better
error estimates of the approximative kernels, and prove that they all carry the
same reflectional symmetries as the exact ones.
  We test the effectiveness of multiple approximative kernels within the
PDE-G-CNN framework on two datasets, and observe an improvement with the new
approximative kernels. We report that the PDE-G-CNNs again allow for a
considerable reduction of network complexity while having comparable or better
performance than G-CNNs and CNNs on the two datasets. Moreover, PDE-G-CNNs have
the advantage of better geometric interpretability over G-CNNs, as the
morphological kernels are related to association fields from neurogeometry.

finite phases, an asymmetry appears around the zero energy in the transmission
spectra except for $\phi\!=\!n\phi_0$, where $n$ is a half-integer and $\phi_0$
is the flux quantum. This asymmetry plays a key role in inducing the charge and
heat current through the thermally biased junction. The finite-size topological
junction hosts topological Andreev bound states, tunable by the phase, which
mediate the current through the junction. However, the current amplitudes are
sensitive to the junction size. The optimization condition for a good

particular, we present a structural relationship graph representation learning
framework for measuring the similarity of the two structural relationships.
Firstly, structural graphs are generated from preprocessed multimodal image
pairs by means of an object-based image analysis approach. Then, a structural
relationship graph convolutional autoencoder (SR-GCAE) is proposed to learn
robust and representative features from graphs. Two loss functions aiming at
reconstructing vertex information and edge information are presented to make
the learned representations applicable for structural relationship similarity
measurement. Subsequently, the similarity levels of two structural
relationships are calculated from learned graph representations and two
difference images are generated based on the similarity levels. After obtaining
the difference images, an adaptive fusion strategy is presented to fuse the two
difference images. Finally, a morphological filtering-based postprocessing
approach is employed to refine the detection results. Experimental results on
five datasets with different modal combinations demonstrate the effectiveness

distill knowledge from one self-supervised ViT to another has not yet been
explored. Moreover, the existing self-supervised knowledge distillation (SSKD)
methods focus on ConvNet based architectures are suboptimal for ViT knowledge
distillation. In this paper, we study knowledge distillation of self-supervised
vision transformers (ViT-SSKD). We show that directly distilling information
from the crucial attention mechanism from teacher to student can significantly
narrow the performance gap between both. In experiments on ImageNet-Subset and
ImageNet-1K, we show that our method AttnDistill outperforms existing
self-supervised knowledge distillation (SSKD) methods and achieves
state-of-the-art k-NN accuracy compared with self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods learning from scratch (with the ViT-S model). We are also the first to
apply the tiny ViT-T model on self-supervised learning. Moreover, AttnDistill
is independent of self-supervised learning algorithms, it can be adapted to ViT
based SSL methods to improve the performance in future research. The code is

logic B{\Sigma}1 which disallows quantifier alternations. Each class is defined
by choosing the set of predicates on positions that may be used. Two key such
fragments are those equipped with the linear ordering and possibly the
successor relation. It is known that these two variants have decidable
membership: ""does an input regular language belong to the class ?"". We rely on
a characterization of B{\Sigma}1 by the operator BPol: given an input class C,
it outputs a class BPol(C) that corresponds to a variant of B{\Sigma}1 equipped
with special predicates associated to C. We extend these results in two
orthogonal directions. First, we use two kinds of inputs: classes G of group
languages (i.e., recognized by a DFA in which each letter induces a permutation
of the states) and extensions thereof, written G+. The classes BPol(G) and
BPol(G+) capture many variants of B{\Sigma}1 which use predicates such as the
linear ordering, the successor, the modular predicates or the alphabetic
modular predicates.
  Second, instead of membership, we explore the more general separation
problem: decide if two regular languages can be separated by a language from
the class under study. We show it is decidable for BPol(G) and BPol(G+) when
this is the case for G. This was known for BPol(G) and for two particular
classes BPol(G+). Yet, the algorithms were indirect and relied on involved
frameworks, yielding poor upper complexity bounds. Our approach is direct. We
work with elementary concepts (mainly, finite automata). Our main contribution
consists in polynomial time Turing reductions from both BPol(G)- and
BPol(G+)-separation to G-separation. This yields polynomial algorithms for key
variants of B{\Sigma}1, including those equipped with the linear ordering and
possibly the successor and/or the modular predicates.

collective cell migration, which is relevant in pathological and morphogenetic

epithelial cells. The driver of collective rotation in such conditions has not
been clearly elucidated, although it has been speculated that spatial
confinement can play an essential role in triggering cell rotation. Here, we
study the growth of epithelial cell colonies freely expanding (i.e., with no
physical constraints) on the surface of cell culture plates, a case which has
received scarce attention in the literature. We find that coordinated cell
rotation spontaneously occurs in cell clusters in the free growth regime, thus
implying that cell confinement is not necessary to elicit collective rotation
as previously suggested. The collective rotation was size and shape dependent:
a highly coordinated disk-like rotation was found in small cell clusters with a
round shape, while collective rotation was suppressed in large irregular cell
clusters generated by merging of different clusters in the course of their
growth. The angular motion was persistent in the same direction, although
clockwise and anticlockwise rotations were equally likely to occur among
different cell clusters. Radial cell velocity was low as compared to the
angular velocity. A clear difference in morphology was observed between cells
at the periphery and the ones in the core of the clusters, the former being
more elongated and spread out as compared to the latter. Overall, our results
provide the first quantitative and systematic evidence that coordinated cell
rotation does not require a spatial confinement and occurs spontaneously in
freely expanding epithelial cell colonies.

and stationary distribution in Wasserstein distance and establish
non-asymptotic, geometric convergence rates. Furthermore, we show that the bias
vector of this limit admits an infinite series expansion with respect to the
stepsize. Consequently, the bias is proportional to the stepsize up to higher
order terms. This result stands in contrast with LSA under i.i.d. data, for
which the bias vanishes. In the reversible chain setting, we provide a general
characterization of the relationship between the bias and the mixing time of
the Markovian data, establishing that they are roughly proportional to each

  While Polyak-Ruppert tail-averaging reduces the variance of the LSA iterates,
it does not affect the bias. The above characterization allows us to show that
the bias can be reduced using Richardson-Romberg extrapolation with $m\ge 2$
stepsizes, which eliminates the $m-1$ leading terms in the bias expansion. This
extrapolation scheme leads to an exponentially smaller bias and an improved

processor with a constant processing time to process information from each

generation of the packet that was most recently processed by a processor. Our
objective is to minimize the average age of processed information over an

system without sacrificing optimality. From this simplification, we propose
three transmission-scheduling policies with 2-optimal guarantees for different
requirements. A distributed Power-2 policy can be implemented without a central
scheduler. With a central scheduler, both Back-Off and Max-Weight policies are
near optimal with different advantages. The Back-Off policy guarantees a bound
on the maximum age of processed information, while the Max-Weight policy
achieves the lowest average age in simulation without the guarantee of bound.
Simulation results confirm our theoretical findings.

overfitting issue of adversarial training by using tools from uniform
stability. One major challenge is that the outer function (as a maximization of

al., 2016) cannot be applied. Our approach is to consider $\eta$-approximate
smoothness: we show that the outer function satisfies this modified smoothness
assumption with $\eta$ being a constant related to the adversarial perturbation
$\epsilon$. Based on this, we derive stability-based generalization bounds for
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the general class of $\eta$-approximate
smooth functions, which covers the adversarial loss. Our results suggest that
robust test accuracy decreases in $\epsilon$ when $T$ is large, with a speed
between $\Omega(\epsilon\sqrt{T})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon T)$. This
phenomenon is also observed in practice. Additionally, we show that a few

attention as they unlatch imaginative applications in all areas of life.
However, developing such models requires huge amounts of data that might
contain privacy-sensitive information, e.g., face identity. While privacy risks
have been extensively demonstrated in the image classification and GAN
generation domains, privacy risks in the text-to-image generation domain are
largely unexplored. In this paper, we perform the first privacy analysis of
text-to-image generation models through the lens of membership inference.
Specifically, we propose three key intuitions about membership information and
design four attack methodologies accordingly. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations on two mainstream text-to-image generation models including
sequence-to-sequence modeling and diffusion-based modeling. The empirical
results show that all of the proposed attacks can achieve significant
performance, in some cases even close to an accuracy of 1, and thus the
corresponding risk is much more severe than that shown by existing membership
inference attacks. We further conduct an extensive ablation study to analyze
the factors that may affect the attack performance, which can guide developers
and researchers to be alert to vulnerabilities in text-to-image generation
models. All these findings indicate that our proposed attacks pose a realistic
privacy threat to the text-to-image generation models.

detection algorithms to avoid obstacles. Algorithms and sensors designed for
such systems need to be computationally efficient, due to the limited energy of
the hardware used for deployment. Biologically inspired event cameras are a
good candidate as a vision sensor for such systems due to their speed, energy
efficiency, and robustness to varying lighting conditions. However, traditional
computer vision algorithms fail to work on event-based outputs, as they lack
photometric features such as light intensity and texture. In this work, we
propose a novel technique that utilizes the temporal information inherently
present in the events to efficiently detect moving objects. Our technique
consists of a lightweight spiking neural architecture that is able to separate
events based on the speed of the corresponding objects. These separated events
are then further grouped spatially to determine object boundaries. This method
of object detection is both asynchronous and robust to camera noise. In
addition, it shows good performance in scenarios with events generated by
static objects in the background, where existing event-based algorithms fail.
We show that by utilizing our architecture, autonomous navigation systems can
have minimal latency and energy overheads for performing object detection.

unique flexibility that can be exploited for complex environments and tasks.
However, their control problem has been considered a challenging subject
because they are of infinite degrees of freedom and highly under-actuated.
Existing studies have mainly relied on simplified and approximated
finite-dimensional models. In this work, we exploit infinite-dimensional
nonlinear control for soft robots. We adopt the Cosserat-rod theory and employ
nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) to model the kinematics and
dynamics of soft manipulators, including their translational motions (for shear
and elongation) and rotational motions (for bending and torsion). The objective
is to achieve position tracking of the whole manipulator in a planar task space
by controlling the moments (generated by actuators). The control design is
inspired by the energy decay property of damped wave equations and has an
inner-outer loop structure. In the outer loop, we design desired rotational
motions that rotate the translational component into a direction that
asymptotically dissipates the energy associated with position tracking errors.
In the inner loop, we design inputs for the rotational components to track
their desired motions, again by dissipating the rotational energy. We prove
that the closed-loop system is exponentially stable and evaluate its
performance through simulations.

for every graphon $W:[0,1]^2\rightarrow [0,1]$, where $t_H(.)$ denotes the
homomorphism density of the graph $H$. Paths and cycles being common is one of
the earliest cornerstones in extremal graph theory, due to Mulholland and Smith
(1959), Goodman (1959), and Sidorenko (1989).
  We prove a graph homomorphism inequality that extends the commonality of

+t_{K_2}(1-W)^{e(H)}$ whenever $H$ is a path or a cycle and
$W:[0,1]^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a bounded symmetric measurable function.

Furthermore, it also settles a recent conjecture of Behague, Morrison, and Noel
in a strong form, who asked if the inequality holds for graphons $W$ and odd
cycles $H$. Our proof uses Schur convexity of complete homogeneous symmetric

complicated endeavor. For practitioners, data investment remains to be a leap
of faith in practice. In this work, we study the data budgeting problem and
formulate it as two sub-problems: predicting (1) what is the saturating
performance if given enough data, and (2) how many data points are needed to
reach near the saturating performance. Different from traditional
dataset-independent methods like PowerLaw, we proposed a learning method to
solve data budgeting problems. To support and systematically evaluate the
learning-based method for data budgeting, we curate a large collection of 383
tabular ML datasets, along with their data vs performance curves. Our empirical
evaluation shows that it is possible to perform data budgeting given a small
pilot study dataset with as few as $50$ data points.

the existence of well trained classifiers on benchmark datasets which can be

function for training deep neural network (DNN) classifiers, the cross entropy
loss can easily lead us to find models which demonstrate severe overfitting
behavior when no other techniques are used for alleviating it such as data
augmentation. In this paper, we prove that the existing cross entropy loss
minimization for training DNN classifiers essentially learns the conditional
entropy of the underlying data distribution of the dataset, i.e., the
information or uncertainty remained in the labels after revealing the input. In
this paper, we propose a mutual information learning framework where we train
DNN classifiers via learning the mutual information between the label and
input. Theoretically, we give the population error probability lower bound in
terms of the mutual information. In addition, we derive the mutual information
lower and upper bounds for a concrete binary classification data model in
$\mbR^n$, and also the error probability lower bound in this scenario. Besides,
we establish the sample complexity for accurately learning the mutual
information from empirical data samples drawn from the underlying data

optimization steps that minimize an objective function that learns the node

that the message passing process in different layers is able to be carried out
over dynamically adjusted graphs. Such property allows more fine-grained
handling of the noisy (or perturbed) graph structure and hence improves the
robustness. Convergence properties of the ASMP scheme are theoretically

both mobility patterns of individuals and their spatiotemporal interactions. To
validate the applicability and relevance of the proposed method, we examine the

the correct values. Second, we classified the reflectance spectra of S-complex

explain agent behaviour or verify alignment. We explore the merits of learning
intrinsically interpretable tree models instead. We develop a recently proposed
method for learning reward trees from preference labels, and show it to be
broadly competitive with neural networks on challenging high-dimensional tasks,
with good robustness to limited or corrupted data. Having found that reward
tree learning can be done effectively in complex settings, we then consider why
it should be used, demonstrating that the interpretable reward structure gives
significant scope for traceability, verification and explanation.

  Calculations of voltage-dependent activation energy",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.mes-hall physics.chem-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Transition metal dichalcogenides are cheap and earth-abundant candidates for
the replacement of precious metals as catalyst materials. Experimental
measurements of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), for example, have
demonstrated significant electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 but there is large
variation depending on preparation method. In order to gain information about
the mechanism and active sites for HER, we have carried out calculations of the
reaction and activation energy for HER at the transition metal doped basal
plane of MoS2 under electrochemical conditions, i.e. including applied
electrode potential and solvent effects. The calculations are based on
identifying the relevant saddle points on the energy surface obtained from
density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation, and
the information on energetics is used to construct voltage-dependent volcano
plots. Doping with 3d-metal atoms as well as Pt is found to enhance hydrogen
adsorption onto the basal plane by introducing electronic states within the
band gap, and in some cases (Co, Ni, Cu, Pt) significant local symmetry
breaking. The Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism is found to be most likely and the
associated energetics show considerable dopant and voltage-dependence. While
the binding free energy of hydrogen can be tuned to be seemingly favorable for
HER, the calculated activation energy turns out to be significant, at least 0.7
eV at a voltage of -0.5 V vs. SHE, indicating low catalytic activity of the
doped basal plane. This suggests that other sites are responsible for the
experimental activity, possibly edges or basal plane defects.

respect to the input distribution parameters that unifies a wide range of
sensitivity measures, including information theoretical metrics such as the
Fisher information. The framework is derived analytically via a constrained
maximization and the sensitivity analysis is reformulated into an eigenvalue
problem. There are only two main steps to implement the sensitivity framework
utilising the likelihood ratio/score function method, a Monte Carlo type
sampling followed by solving an eigenvalue equation. The resulting eigenvectors
then provide the directions for simultaneous variations of the input parameters
and guide the focus to perturb uncertainty the most. Not only is it
conceptually simple, but numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed
framework also provides new sensitivity insights, such as the combined
sensitivity of multiple correlated uncertainty metrics, robust sensitivity
analysis with an entropic constraint, and approximation of deterministic
sensitivities. Three different examples, ranging from a simple cantilever beam
to an offshore marine riser, are used to demonstrate the potential applications
of the proposed sensitivity framework to applied mechanics problems.

functions associated with various behavioral states. These synchronous
fluctuations in the electrical activity of the brain are also referred to as
brain rhythms. At the cellular level, the rhythmicity can be induced by various
mechanisms of intrinsic oscillations in neurons or network circulation of
excitation between synaptically coupled neurons. One of the specific mechanisms
concerns the activity of brain astrocytes that accompany neurons and can
coherently modulate synaptic contacts of neighboring neurons, synchronizing
their activity. Recent studies have shown that coronavirus infection
(Covid-19), entering the central nervous system and infecting astrocytes,
causes various metabolic disorders. Specifically, Covid-19 can depress the
synthesis of astrocytic glutamate and GABA. It is also known that in the
postcovid state, patients may suffer from symptoms of anxiety and impaired
cognitive functions, which may be a consequence of disturbed brain rhythms. We
propose a mathematical model of a spiking neural network accompanied by
astrocytes capable to generate quasi-synchronous rhythmic bursting discharges.
The model predicts that if the astrocytes are infected, and the release of
glutamate is depressed, then normal burst rhythmicity suffers dramatically.
Interestingly, in some cases, the failure of network coherence may be
intermittent with intervals of normal rhythmicity, or the synchronization can
completely disappears.

stable if and only if the destination set contains all loops (i.e., the paths
from each state to itself); an LDS is uniformly robustly set stable, or
finite-time set stable with ratio one, if and only if all states outside the
destination set are unreachable from any self-reachable state; and an LDS is
asymptotically set stable with ratio one if and only if the largest robustly
invariant subset (LRIS) in the destination set is reachable from any state. In
addition, it is proved that uniform robust set stability implies robust set
stability, and robust set stability implies asymptotical set stability with
ratio one. However, the inverse claims are not generally true. The relations
between robust stability and stability under random switching are revealed,
that is, the asymptotical/finite-time set stability with ratio one under
uncertain switching is equivalent to asymptotical/finite-time set stability of
the LDS under random switching. Furthermore, it is proved that, for uniform set

stability is equivalent to the stability with respect to the LRIS in the

particular, we show that interpolating both weights and biases linearly leads
to very different influences on the final output, and when different classes
have different last-layer biases on a deep network, there will be a long
plateau in both the loss and accuracy interpolation (which existing theory of
MLI cannot explain). We also show how the last-layer biases for different

analogs of classical bits which assume binary values '0' or '1'. They are
useful to the extent to which they can persist in quantum superpositions of '0'
and '1' in real environments. However, such TLS are never alone in real
materials and devices, and couplings to other degrees of freedom limit the
lifetimes - called decoherence times - of the superposition states. Decoherence
occurs via two major routes - excitation hopping and fluctuating
electromagnetic fields. Common mitigation strategies are based on material
improvements, exploitation of clock states which couple only to second rather
than first order to external perturbations, and reduction of interactions via
extreme dilution of pure materials made from isotopes selected to minimize
noise from nuclear spins. We demonstrate that for a dense TLS network in a
noisy nuclear spin bath, we can take advantage of interactions to pass from
hopping to fluctuation dominance, increasing decoherence times by almost three
orders of magnitude. In the dilute rare-earth insulator LiY1-xTbxF4, Tb ions
realize TLS characterized by a 30GHz splitting and readily implemented clock
states. Dipolar interactions lead to coherent, localized pairs of Tb ions, that
decohere due to fluctuating quantum mechanical ring-exchange interaction,
sensing the slow dynamics of the surrounding, nearly localized Tb spins. The
hopping and fluctuation regimes are sharply distinguished by their Rabi
oscillations and the invisible vs. strong effect of classic 'error correcting'
microwave pulse sequences. Laying open the decoherence mechanisms at play in a
dense, disordered and noisy network of interacting TLS, our work expands the
search space for quantum sensors and qubits to include clusters in dense,

R$_{\rm J}$, and an orbital period of 1.543 days. The host is a K3V ($T_{\rm
eff}=4660 \pm 41$, K) metal-poor (${\rm [Fe/H]}=-0.26 \pm 0.07$, dex) dwarf
star with a mass and radius of $0.72 \pm 0.04$, M$_{\odot}$,and $0.86 \pm
0.04$, R$_{\odot}$. Its age and rotation period of $10.02^{+3.29}_{-7.30}$, Gyr
and $17.88 \pm 0.08$, d respectively, are in accordance with the observed
moderately low stellar activity level. When comparing NGTS-21b with currently
known transiting hot Jupiters with similar equilibrium temperatures, it is
found to have one of the largest measured radii despite its large mass.
Inflation-free planetary structure models suggest the planet's atmosphere is
inflated by $\sim21\%$, while inflationary models predict a radius consistent
with observations, thus pointing to stellar irradiation as the probable origin
of NGTS-21b's radius inflation. Additionally, NGTS-21b's bulk density ($1.25
\pm 0.15$, g/cm$^3$) is also amongst the largest within the population of
metal-poor giant hosts ([Fe/H] < 0.0), helping to reveal a falling upper
boundary in metallicity-planet density parameter space that is in concordance
with core accretion formation models. The discovery of rare planetary systems
such as NGTS-21 greatly contributes towards better constraints being placed on
the formation and evolution mechanisms of massive planets orbiting low-mass
stars.

of M. Kato and P. Cassou-Nogu\`es in two variable cases, showing that the
stratification of the parameter space can be controlled by using the (partial)

large-scale dataset, and then fine-tune the whole model for adapting to
long-tailed data. Though promising, fine-tuning the whole pretrained model
tends to suffer from high cost in computation and deployment of different
models for different tasks, as well as weakened generalization ability for
overfitting to certain features of long-tailed data. To alleviate these issues,
we propose an effective Long-tailed Prompt Tuning method for long-tailed
classification. LPT introduces several trainable prompts into a frozen
pretrained model to adapt it to long-tailed data. For better effectiveness, we
divide prompts into two groups: 1) a shared prompt for the whole long-tailed
dataset to learn general features and to adapt a pretrained model into target
domain; and 2) group-specific prompts to gather group-specific features for the
samples which have similar features and also to empower the pretrained model
with discrimination ability. Then we design a two-phase training paradigm to
learn these prompts. In phase 1, we train the shared prompt via supervised
prompt tuning to adapt a pretrained model to the desired long-tailed domain. In
phase 2, we use the learnt shared prompt as query to select a small best
matched set for a group of similar samples from the group-specific prompt set
to dig the common features of these similar samples, then optimize these
prompts with dual sampling strategy and asymmetric GCL loss. By only
fine-tuning a few prompts while fixing the pretrained model, LPT can reduce
training and deployment cost by storing a few prompts, and enjoys a strong
generalization ability of the pretrained model. Experiments show that on
various long-tailed benchmarks, with only ~1.1% extra parameters, LPT achieves
comparable performance than previous whole model fine-tuning methods, and is
more robust to domain-shift.

vision tasks but still suffer from heavy computation costs when processing a
large number of tokens. Many advanced approaches have been developed to reduce
the total number of tokens in large-scale vision transformers, especially for
image classification tasks. Typically, they select a small group of essential
tokens according to their relevance with the class token, then fine-tune the
weights of the vision transformer. Such fine-tuning is less practical for dense
prediction due to the much heavier computation and GPU memory cost than image
classification. In this paper, we focus on a more challenging problem, i.e.,
accelerating large-scale vision transformers for dense prediction without any
additional re-training or fine-tuning. In response to the fact that
high-resolution representations are necessary for dense prediction, we present
two non-parametric operators, a token clustering layer to decrease the number
of tokens and a token reconstruction layer to increase the number of tokens.
The following steps are performed to achieve this: (i) we use the token
clustering layer to cluster the neighboring tokens together, resulting in
low-resolution representations that maintain the spatial structures; (ii) we
apply the following transformer layers only to these low-resolution
representations or clustered tokens; and (iii) we use the token reconstruction
layer to re-create the high-resolution representations from the refined
low-resolution representations. The results obtained by our method are
promising on five dense prediction tasks, including object detection, semantic

formation process. The leading method to observe $\textbf{B}$ is using
polarized thermal emission from dust grains aligned with $\textbf{B}$. However,
in dense environments such as protostellar cores, dust grains may have
inefficient alignment due to strong gas randomizations, so that using dust
polarization to trace $\textbf{B}$ is uncertain. Hoang $\&$ Lazarian (2016)
demonstrated that the grain alignment by RAdiative Torques is enhanced if dust
grains contain embedded iron inclusions. Here we extend POLARIS code to study
the effect of iron inclusions on grain alignment and thermal dust polarization
toward a protostellar core, assuming uniform magnetic fields. We found that
paramagnetic grains produce a low polarization degree of $p \sim 1\%$ in the
envelope and negligible $p \ll 1\%$ in the central region due to the loss of
grain alignment. In contrast, grains with a high level of iron inclusions can
have perfect alignment and produce high $p \sim 40\%$ in the envelope and low
$p \leq 10\%$ in the central region. Grains with a moderate level of iron
inclusions induce the polarization flipping from $\textbf{P}$ $\parallel$
$\textbf{B}$ at millimeter to $\textbf{P}$ $\perp$ $\textbf{B}$ at
submillimeter due to the change in the internal alignment caused by slow
internal relaxation. The weak alignment of very large grains of $a \geq 10\mu
m$ reduces the polarization by dichroic extinction at submillimeter
wavelengths. We found a positive correlation between p and the level of iron
inclusions, which opens a new window to constrain the abundance of irons locked
in dust through dust polarimetry.

values; doing so often involves expert intuition and hand-tuning to find a
configuration that extrapolates well without overfitting. This paper considers
automatic methods for configuring a neural network that extrapolates in time
for the domain of visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectroscopy. In particular,
we study the effect of (a) selecting samples for validating configurations and
(b) using ensembles.
  Most of the time, models are built of the past to predict the future. To
encourage the neural network model to extrapolate, we consider validating model
configurations on samples that are shifted in time similar to the test set. We
experiment with three validation set choices: (1) a random sample of 1/3 of
non-test data (the technique used in previous work), (2) using the latest 1/3
(sorted by time), and (3) using a semantically meaningful subset of the data.
Hyperparameter optimization relies on the validation set to estimate test-set
error, but neural network variance obfuscates the true error value. Ensemble
averaging - computing the average across many neural networks - can reduce the
variance of prediction errors.
  To test these methods, we do a comprehensive study of a held-out 2018 harvest
season of mango fruit given VNIR spectra from 3 prior years. We find that
ensembling improves the state-of-the-art model's variance and accuracy.
Furthermore, hyperparameter optimization experiments - with and without
ensemble averaging and with each validation set choice - show that when
ensembling is combined with using the latest 1/3 of samples as the validation
set, a neural network configuration is found automatically that is on par with

Spectral2Spectral employs an unsupervised deep training strategy to obtain
high-quality images from noisy data with an end-to-end fashion. The structural

development must be ensured through a wheel impact test. However, manufacturing
and testing a real wheel requires a significant time and money because
developing an optimal wheel design requires numerous iterative processes to
modify the wheel design and verify the safety performance. Accordingly, wheel
impact tests have been replaced by computer simulations such as finite element
analysis (FEA); however, it still incurs high computational costs for modeling
and analysis, and requires FEA experts. In this study, we present an aluminum
road wheel impact performance prediction model based on deep learning that
replaces computationally expensive and time-consuming 3D FEA. For this purpose,
2D disk-view wheel image data, 3D wheel voxel data, and barrier mass values
used for the wheel impact test were utilized as the inputs to predict the
magnitude of the maximum von Mises stress, corresponding location, and the
stress distribution of the 2D disk-view. The input data were first compressed
into a latent space with a 3D convolutional variational autoencoder (cVAE) and
2D convolutional autoencoder (cAE). Subsequently, the fully connected layers
were used to predict the impact performance, and a decoder was used to predict
the stress distribution heatmap of the 2D disk-view. The proposed model can
replace the impact test in the early wheel-development stage by predicting the
impact performance in real-time and can be used without domain knowledge. The
time required for the wheel development process can be reduced by using this
mechanism.

been focused on realizing quantum supremacy in machine learning. Existing
quantum ML methods either (1) embed a classical model into a target Hamiltonian
to enable quantum optimization or (2) represent a quantum model using
variational quantum circuits and apply classical gradient-based optimization.
The former method leverages the power of quantum optimization but only supports
simple ML models, while the latter provides flexibility in model design but
relies on gradient calculation, resulting in barren plateau (i.e., gradient
vanishing) and frequent classical-quantum interactions. To address the
limitations of existing quantum ML methods, we introduce Quark, a gradient-free
quantum learning framework that optimizes quantum ML models using quantum
optimization. Quark does not rely on gradient computation and therefore avoids
barren plateau and frequent classical-quantum interactions. In addition, Quark
can support more general ML models than prior quantum ML methods and achieves a
dataset-size-independent optimization complexity. Theoretically, we prove that
Quark can outperform classical gradient-based methods by reducing model query
complexity for highly non-convex problems; empirically, evaluations on the Edge
Detection and Tiny-MNIST tasks show that Quark can support complex ML models
and significantly reduce the number of measurements needed for discovering
near-optimal weights for these tasks.

called a time-bidirectional state, is equivalent to a joined state of two
particles propagating in opposite time directions. For a general
time-bidirectional state, we derive outcome probabilities of generalized

show how the obtained expressions reduce to known ones in the special cases of
no postselection and generalized two-state (density) vectors. Then we develop
tomography protocols based on mutually unbiased bases and a symmetric
informationally complete positive operator-valued measure, allowing
experimental reconstruction of an unknown single qubit time-bidirectional

for vehicle coordination, intersections act as natural bottlenecks. A
formidable challenge for existing automated intersections lies in detecting and
reasoning about uncertainty from the operating environment and human-driven
vehicles. In this paper, we propose a risk-aware intelligent intersection
system for autonomous vehicles (AVs) as well as human-driven vehicles (HVs). We
cast the problem as a novel class of Multi-agent Chance-Constrained Stochastic
Shortest Path (MCC-SSP) problems and devise an exact Integer Linear Programming
(ILP) formulation that is scalable in the number of agents' interaction points
(e.g., potential collision points at the intersection). In particular, when the
number of agents within an interaction point is small, which is often the case
in intersections, the ILP has a polynomial number of variables and constraints.
To further improve the running time performance, we show that the collision
risk computation can be performed offline. Additionally, a trajectory
optimization workflow is provided to generate risk-aware trajectories for any
given intersection. The proposed framework is implemented in CARLA simulator
and evaluated under a fully autonomous intersection with AVs only as well as in
a hybrid setup with a signalized intersection for HVs and an intelligent scheme
for AVs. As verified via simulations, the featured approach improves
intersection's efficiency by up to $200\%$ while also conforming to the
specified tunable risk threshold.

optimization layers to encode constraints and inductive priors has taken hold
in recent years. Most existing methods focus on implicitly differentiating
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions in a way that requires expensive
computations on the Jacobian matrix, which can be slow and memory-intensive. In
this paper, we developed a new framework, named Alternating Differentiation
(Alt-Diff), that differentiates optimization problems (here, specifically in
the form of convex optimization problems with polyhedral constraints) in a fast
and recursive way. Alt-Diff decouples the differentiation procedure into a
primal update and a dual update in an alternating way. Accordingly, Alt-Diff
substantially decreases the dimensions of the Jacobian matrix especially for
optimization with large-scale constraints and thus increases the computational
speed of implicit differentiation. We show that the gradients obtained by
Alt-Diff are consistent with those obtained by differentiating KKT conditions.
In addition, we propose to truncate Alt-Diff to further accelerate the
computational speed. Under some standard assumptions, we show that the
truncation error of gradients is upper bounded by the same order of variables'
estimation error. Therefore, Alt-Diff can be truncated to further increase
computational speed without sacrificing much accuracy. A series of
comprehensive experiments validate the superiority of Alt-Diff.

in the cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation as a model for spatial collapse of
Langmuir waves in plasma, the most abundant form of observed matter in the
universe. Zakharov assumed that (NLS) blow up of solutions is self-similar and
radially symmetric, and that singularity formation can be modeled by a solution
of an associated self-similar, complex ordinary differential equation~(ODE). A
parameter a>0 appears in the ODE, and the dependent variable, Q, satisfies
(Q(0),Q'(0))=(Q_{0},0), where Q(0)>0. A fundamentally important step towards
putting the Zakharov model on a firm mathematical footing is to prove, when
N=3, whether values a>0 and Q_{0}>0 exist such that Q also satisfies the
physically important `zero-energy' integral constraint. Since 1972 this has

this technique is useful for video communication underwater over distances of

abilities of artificial intelligence and machine learning models on visual

different weights for the purpose of prediction of a particular input. The
precedent for classification, however, is set by the image processing

which provides a clear demarcation of the areas of interest in the image, be it
regions or objects. The Efficiency of CNN can be related to the preprocessing
done before training. Further, it is a well-established fact that heterogeneity
in image sources is detrimental to the performance of CNNs. Thus, the added
functionality of heterogeneity elimination is performed by the image processing

  Intersection Simulation","13 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.RO cs.GR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Traffic intersections are important scenes that can be seen almost everywhere
in the traffic system. Currently, most simulation methods perform well at
highways and urban traffic networks. In intersection scenarios, the challenge
lies in the lack of clearly defined lanes, where agents with various motion
plannings converge in the central area from different directions. Traditional
model-based methods are difficult to drive agents to move realistically at
intersections without enough predefined lanes, while data-driven methods often
require a large amount of high-quality input data. Simultaneously, tedious
parameter tuning is inevitable involved to obtain the desired simulation
results. In this paper, we present a novel adaptive and planning-aware
hybrid-driven method (TraInterSim) to simulate traffic intersection scenarios.
Our hybrid-driven method combines an optimization-based data-driven scheme with
a velocity continuity model. It guides the agent's movements using real-world
data and can generate those behaviors not present in the input data. Our
optimization method fully considers velocity continuity, desired speed,
direction guidance, and planning-aware collision avoidance. Agents can perceive
others' motion planning and relative distance to avoid possible collisions. To
preserve the individual flexibility of different agents, the parameters in our
method are automatically adjusted during the simulation. TraInterSim can
generate realistic behaviors of heterogeneous agents in different traffic
intersection scenarios in interactive rates. Through extensive experiments as
well as user studies, we validate the effectiveness and rationality of the
proposed simulation method.

get away from. To truly realize the benefits from innovation and technology,
this crisis has to be resolved, not just through tactical solutions but through
developments that enhance the sustainability of the web and its benefits.
Significant strides are being made in the evolution of digital services enabled
by technology, regulation, and the sheer pace of societal change. The journey
to the decentralized web is mirroring the convergence of the physical and
digital worlds across all economies and is increasingly embracing the digital
native world. Technology has provided the foundational platform for individuals
and entities to create and manage wealth, potentially without the need for big
institutions. Ironically, despite all of the advancements, we are still facing
an unprecedented and increasing wealth gap. Clearly, the system is broken, not
just around the edges but at the very core of the democratic underpinning of
our society. In this whitepaper, we propose how artificial intelligence on
blockchain can be used to generate a new class of identity through direct human
computer interaction. We demonstrate how this, combined with new perspectives
for sustaining community and governance embedded within the use of blockchain
technology, will underpin a sustainable solution to protect identity,

structure. In this paper, a deep learning based approach is presented by
leveraging the method of computer vision to classify 50 tree species, on the
basis of bark texture using the BarkVN-50 dataset. This is the maximum number
of trees being considered for bark classification till now. A convolutional

  Described in this document are: - the process of manipulation pre-import and
import of the data in a Graph Database Management System (GDBMS) such as
ArangoDB, creation of nodes, relations (edges) between the nodes and a graph
composed of these nodes and edges; - the GraphQL API implemented in NodeJS to
request data from the Graph Database Management System (GDBMS); - the frontend
interface made with TypeScript and React consisting of the search
functionalities and ability to visualize results in Cytoscape Network Graphs; -
the Label Propagation Community Detection Algorithm execution on the graph, the
found clusters which are stored and visualized to the user whenever requested.

multiagent system. It is also a reproductive part for an \emph{agent} that
makes the agent take actions and decide independently and reproduce coworkers.
By defining different DNA structures, one can establish new agents and
different nets for different usages. We initiate such thinking as \emph{DNA

programming can help us manage large systems with various elements with an
incredibly organized customizable structure. An agent can reproduce another
agent. We put one or a few agents around a given network, and the agents will
reproduce themselves till they can reach others and pervade the whole network.
An agent's position or other environmental or geographical characteristics make
it possible for an agent to know its active set of \emph{genes} on its DNA. The
active set of genes specifies its duties. There is a database that includes a
list of functions s.t. each one is an implementation of what a \emph{gene}
represents. To utilize a decentralized database, we may use a blockchain-based
structure.
  This design can adapt to a system that manages many static and dynamic
networks. This network could be a distributed system, a decentralized system, a
telecommunication network such as a 5G monitoring system, an IoT management
system, or even an energy management system. The final system is the
combination of all the agents and the overlay net that connects the agents. We

resulted in significant computational difficulties when solving large-scale
linear systems or inverting matrices. As a result, fast approximate iterative
matrix inversion methodologies via Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) acceleration
has been a subject of extensive research, to find solutions where classic and
direct inversion are too expensive to conduct. Some currently used methods are
Neumann Series (NS), Newton iteration (NI), Chebyshev Iteration (CI), and
Successive Over-Relaxation, to cite a few. In this work, we develop a new
iterative algorithm based off the NS, which we named 'Nested Neumann' (NN).
This new methodology generalizes higher orders of the NI (or CI), by taking
advantage of a computationally free iterative update of the preconditioning
matrix as a function of a given 'inception depth'. It has been mathematically
demonstrated that the NN: (i) convergences given the preconditioning satisfies
the spectral norm condition of the NS, (ii) has an order of rate of convergence
has been shown to be equivalent to the order (inception depth plus one), and
(iii) has an optimal inception depth is an inception depth of one or preferably
two, depending on RAM constraints. Furthermore, we derive an explicit formula
for the NN, which is applicable to massive sparse matrices, given an increase
in computational cost. Importantly, the NN finds an analytic equivalancy
statement between the NS and the the NN (NI, CI, and higher orders), which is
of importance for mMIMO systems. Finally, the NN method is applicable positive
semi-definite matrices for matrix inversion, and applicable to any linear
system (sparse, non-sparse, complex, etc.).
