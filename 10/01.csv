combinations of the fermionis fields,\cite{Diakonov2011} suggests that in
general relativity the metric may have dimension 2, i.e.
$[g_{\mu\nu}]=1/[L]^2$. Several other approaches to quantum gravity, including
the model of superplastic vacuum and $BF$-theories of gravity support this
suggesuion. The important consequence of such metric dimension is that all the
diffeomorphism invariant quantities are dimensionless for any dimension of
spacetime. These include the action $S$, interval $s$, cosmological constant
$\Lambda$, scalar curvature $R$, scalar field $\Phi$, etc. Here we are trying
to further exploit the Diakonov idea, and consider the dimension of the Planck
constant. The application of the Diakonov theory suggests that the Planck
constant $\hbar$ is the parameter of the Minkowski metric. The Minkowski
parameter $\hbar$ is invariant only under Lorentz transformations, and is not
diffeomorphism invariant. As a result the Planck constant $\hbar$ has nonzero
dimension -- the dimension of length [L]. Whether this Planck constant length
is related to the Planck length scale, is an open question. In principle there
can be different Minkowski vacua with their own values of the parameter
$\hbar$. Then in the thermal contact between the two vacua their temperatures
obey the analog of the Tolman law: $\hbar_1/T_1= \hbar_2/T_2$.

topic in deep learning. Among the open questions are what kind of knowledge
needs to be preserved for the transfer, and how it can be effectively achieved.
Several recent work have shown good performance of distillation methods using
relation-based knowledge. These algorithms are extremely attractive in that
they are based on simple inter-sample similarities. Nevertheless, a proper
metric of affinity and use of it in this context is far from well understood.
In this paper, by explicitly modularising knowledge distillation into a
framework of three components, i.e. affinity, normalisation, and loss, we give
a unified treatment of these algorithms as well as study a number of unexplored
combinations of the modules. With this framework we perform extensive
evaluations of numerous distillation objectives for image classification, and
obtain a few useful insights for effective design choices while demonstrating
how relation-based knowledge distillation could achieve comparable performance
to the state of the art in spite of the simplicity.

need, driven by growing data demands and the consequent impending data crunch

(MDM), where the spatial modes of light form the encoding basis, has enormous
potential and appeal, but is impeded by modal noise due to imperfect channels.
Here we overcome this challenge by breaking the existing MDM paradigm of using
the modes themselves as a discrete basis, instead exploiting the polarization
inhomogeneity (vectorness) of vectorial light as our information carrier. We
show that this encoding basis can be partitioned and detected almost at will,
and measured in a channel independent fashion, a fact we confirm experimentally

  neural networks",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Implicit neural networks have become increasingly attractive in the machine
learning community since they can achieve competitive performance but use much
less computational resources. Recently, a line of theoretical works established
the global convergences for first-order methods such as gradient descent if the
implicit networks are over-parameterized. However, as they train all layers
together, their analyses are equivalent to only studying the evolution of the
output layer. It is unclear how the implicit layer contributes to the training.
Thus, in this paper, we restrict ourselves to only training the implicit layer.
We show that global convergence is guaranteed, even if only the implicit layer
is trained. On the other hand, the theoretical understanding of when and how
the training performance of an implicit neural network can be generalized to
unseen data is still under-explored. Although this problem has been studied in
standard feed-forward networks, the case of implicit neural networks is still
intriguing since implicit networks theoretically have infinitely many layers.
Therefore, this paper investigates the generalization error for implicit neural
networks. Specifically, we study the generalization of an implicit network
activated by the ReLU function over random initialization. We provide a
generalization bound that is initialization sensitive. As a result, we show
that gradient flow with proper random initialization can train a sufficient
over-parameterized implicit network to achieve arbitrarily small generalization
errors.

lack of a regulatory framework, it is common to observe miners exploiting their
privileged position by front-running transactions and obtaining risk-fee
profits. In this work, we propose to modify the interaction between miners and
users and initiate the study of {\em verifiable sequencing rules}. As in the
status quo, miners can determine the content of a block; however, they commit
to respecting a sequencing rule that constrains the execution ordering and is
verifiable (there is a polynomial time algorithm that can verify if the
execution ordering satisfies such constraints). Thus in the event a miner
deviates from the sequencing rule, anyone can generate a proof of
non-compliance. We ask if there are sequencing rules that limit price
manipulation from miners in a two-token liquidity pool exchange. Our first
result is an impossibility theorem: for any sequencing rule, there is an
instance of user transactions where the miner can obtain non-zero risk-free
profits. In light of this impossibility result, our main result is a verifiable
sequencing rule that provides execution price guarantees for users. In
particular, for any user transaction A, it ensures that either (1) the

Following an advanced experimental facility setup that mimics SNS operating

where fault precursors are introduced in the system to a degree enough to cause
degradation in the waveform signals, but not enough to reach a real fault. Nine
different machine learning techniques based on ensemble trees, convolutional
neural networks, support vector machines, and hierarchical voting ensembles are
proposed to detect the fault precursors. Although all 9 models have shown a
perfect and identical performance during the training and testing phase, the
performance of most models has decreased in the prognosis phase once they got
exposed to real-world data from the 21 experiments. The hierarchical voting
ensemble, which features multiple layers of diverse models, maintains a
distinguished performance in early detection of the fault precursors with 95%
success rate (20/21 tests), followed by adaboost and extremely randomized trees

the data acquisition system to facilitate streaming and handling big data for

Unlike conventional normalizing flow inference methods based the maximum
likelihood principle, which require costly backpropagation through ODE solvers,
our interpolant approach leads to a simple quadratic loss for the velocity
itself which is expressed in terms of expectations that are readily amenable to
empirical estimation. The flow can be used to generate samples from either the
base or target, and to estimate the likelihood at any time along the
interpolant. In addition, the flow can be optimized to minimize the path length
of the interpolant density, thereby paving the way for building optimal
transport maps. In situations where the base is a Gaussian density, we also
show that the velocity of our normalizing flow can also be used to construct a
diffusion model to sample the target as well as estimate its score. However,
our approach shows that we can bypass this diffusion completely and work at the
level of the probability flow with greater simplicity, opening an avenue for
methods based solely on ordinary differential equations as an alternative to
those based on stochastic differential equations. Benchmarking on density
estimation tasks illustrates that the learned flow can match and surpass
conventional continuous flows at a fraction of the cost, and compares well with
diffusions on image generation on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet $32\times32$. The

interesting phenomenology to tackle some of current problems in cosmology,
namely the vectors could constitute the dark matter component. It could also
lead to possible signatures imprinted in a gravitational wave spectrum. Through
this coupling, a rolling inflaton induces an exponential production of the
transverse polarizations of the vector field, having a maximum at the end of
inflation when the inflaton field velocity is at its maximum. These gauge
particles, already parity asymmetric, will source the tensor components of the
metric perturbations, leading to the production of parity violating
gravitational waves. In this work we examine the vector particle production
with an attempt to mimic its backreaction effects on the inflation evolution in
the weak coupling regime. Furthermore, we fully integrate the gauge particle
amplitudes spectrum during this production epoch, studying the behavior until
the end of reheating. Finally, we calculate the gravitational wave spectrum
solely relying on the vector mode WKB expansion in its regime of validity.

generated by a variant of the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics
(SINDy) method. We start with an overview of a variety of non-linear system
identification techniques, namely, SINDy, weak-SINDy, and the occupation kernel
method. Under the assumption that the dynamics are a finite linear combination
of a set of basis functions, these methods establish a matrix equation to
recover coefficients. We illuminate the structural similarities between these
techniques and establish a projection property for the weak-SINDy technique.
Following the overview, we analyze the error of surrogate models generated by a
simplified version of weak-SINDy. In particular, under the assumption of
boundedness of a composition operator given by the solution, we show that (i)
the surrogate dynamics converges towards the true dynamics and (ii) the
solution of the surrogate model is reasonably close to the true solution.
Finally, as an application, we discuss the use of a combination of weak-SINDy
surrogate modeling and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to build a
surrogate model for partial differential equations (PDEs).

In this paper, we provide the first empirical study of SSL pre-training for

We find that training on short sequences can dramatically reduce resource costs

slip and grip force. Results suggest that receiving any feedback is better than
receiving none, however, dual-modality feedback is far superior to either

order to produce physically meaningful probabilistic power curve models. The
first model investigated was a warped heteroscedastic Gaussian process, and was
found to be ineffective due to specific shortcomings of the Gaussian Process in
relation to the warping function. The second model - an approximated Gaussian
Process with a Beta likelihood was highly successful and demonstrated that a
working bounded probabilistic model results in better predictive uncertainty
than a corresponding unbounded one without meaningful loss in predictive
accuracy. Such a bounded model thus offers increased accuracy for performance
monitoring and increased operator confidence in the model due to guaranteed

a model Au supported catalyst system over a range of temperatures using a

observation of dynamic shape changes and particle evaporation rates, with
computational techniques, which enable understanding the fundamental

evolution mechanism in which mobile adatoms form through desorption from
low-coordination facets and subsequently evaporate off the particle surface. By
understanding the role of temperature in the competition between surface
diffusion and evaporation, we are able to show how individual atomic movements
lead to particle-scale morphological changes, and rationalize why evaporation

redshift-, and environment-matched control sample of isolated galaxies. We find

the scientific literature. Both regression and classification problems are
addressed by a large array of techniques that involve learning algorithms.
Unfortunately, the measurement errors of the data used to train machine
learning models are almost always neglected. This leads to estimations of the
performance of the models (and thus their generalisation power) that is too
optimistic since it is always assumed that the target variables (what one wants
to predict) are correct. In physics, this is a dramatic deficiency as it can
lead to the belief that theories or patterns exist where, in reality, they do
not. This paper addresses this deficiency by deriving formulas for commonly
used metrics (both for regression and classification problems) that take into
account measurement errors of target variables. The new formulas give an
estimation of the metrics which is always more pessimistic than what is
obtained with the classical ones, not taking into account measurement errors.
The formulas given here are of general validity, completely model-independent,
and can be applied without limitations. Thus, with statistical confidence, one
can analyze the existence of relationships when dealing with measurements with
errors of any kind. The formulas have wide applicability outside physics and
can be used in all problems where measurement errors are relevant to the
conclusions of studies.

$\gamma$-ray excess is in tension with the FAST observation for reasonable
choices of astrophysical factors. But considering the large uncertainty on

CPD-65\,264, a new post common envelope binary with an orbital period of
1.37\,days that contains a massive white dwarf ($ 0.86\pm
0.06\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) and an intermediate-mass
($1.00\pm0.05\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) main-sequence secondary star. We
characterized the secondary star and measured the orbital period using
high-resolution optical spectroscopy. The white dwarf parameters are determined
from HST spectroscopy. In addition, TESS observations revealed that up to 19
per cent of the surface of the secondary is covered with starspots. Small
period changes found in the light curve indicate that the secondary is the
second example of a G-type secondary star in a post-common envelope binary with
latitudinal differential rotation. Given the relatively large mass of the white
dwarf and the short orbital period, future mass transfer will be dynamically
and thermally stable and the system will evolve into a cataclysmic variable.
The formation of the system can be understood assuming common envelope
evolution without contributions from energy sources besides orbital energy.
CPD-65\,264 is the seventh post-common envelope binaries with intermediate-mass
secondaries that can be understood assuming a small efficiency in the common
envelope energy equation, in agreement with findings for post-common envelope
binaries with M-dwarf or sub-stellar companions.

eigenvalue of the Hessian, also known as the sharpness $S(\theta)$, is bounded
by $2/\eta$, training is ""stable"" and the training loss decreases
monotonically. Recent works, however, have observed that this assumption does
not hold when training modern neural networks with full batch or large batch
gradient descent. Most recently, Cohen et al. (2021) observed two important
phenomena. The first, dubbed progressive sharpening, is that the sharpness
steadily increases throughout training until it reaches the instability cutoff
$2/\eta$. The second, dubbed edge of stability, is that the sharpness hovers at
$2/\eta$ for the remainder of training while the loss continues decreasing,
albeit non-monotonically. We demonstrate that, far from being chaotic, the
dynamics of gradient descent at the edge of stability can be captured by a
cubic Taylor expansion: as the iterates diverge in direction of the top
eigenvector of the Hessian due to instability, the cubic term in the local
Taylor expansion of the loss function causes the curvature to decrease until
stability is restored. This property, which we call self-stabilization, is a
general property of gradient descent and explains its behavior at the edge of
stability. A key consequence of self-stabilization is that gradient descent at
the edge of stability implicitly follows projected gradient descent (PGD) under
the constraint $S(\theta) \le 2/\eta$. Our analysis provides precise
predictions for the loss, sharpness, and deviation from the PGD trajectory
throughout training, which we verify both empirically in a number of standard
settings and theoretically under mild conditions. Our analysis uncovers the
mechanism for gradient descent's implicit bias towards stability.

approaches where the central server groups agent population into clusters with

of personalization. While effective, they lack a deep elaboration on what kind
of data heterogeneity and how the data heterogeneity impacts the accuracy
performance of the participating clients. In contrast to many of the prior
federated learning approaches, we demonstrate not only the issue of data
heterogeneity in current setups is not necessarily a problem but also in fact
it can be beneficial for the FL participants. Our observations are intuitive:
(1) Dissimilar labels of clients (label skew) are not necessarily considered
data heterogeneity, and (2) the principal angle between the agents' data

underrepresent bias groups $B$ (\eg Female) within class labels $Y$ (\eg

Most recent methods that address this problem require significant architectural
changes or additional loss functions requiring more hyper-parameter tuning.
Alternatively, data sampling baselines from the class imbalance literature (\eg
Undersampling, Upweighting), which can often be implemented in a single line of
code and often have no hyperparameters, offer a cheaper and more efficient
solution. However, these methods suffer from significant shortcomings. For
example, Undersampling drops a significant part of the input distribution per
epoch while Oversampling repeats samples, causing overfitting. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce a new class-conditioned sampling method: Bias
Mimicking. The method is based on the observation that if a class $c$ bias
distribution, \ie $P_D(B|Y=c)$ is mimicked across every $c^{\prime}\neq c$,
then $Y$ and $B$ are statistically independent. Using this notion, BM, through
a novel training procedure, ensures that the model is exposed to the entire
distribution per epoch without repeating samples. Consequently, Bias Mimicking
improves underrepresented groups' accuracy of sampling methods by 3\% over four

nonsampling methods. Code: \url{https://github.com/mqraitem/Bias-Mimicking}

structures could lead to new biological discoveries and new treatments
targeting yet incurable diseases. Despite recent advances in protein structure
prediction, directly generating diverse, novel protein structures from neural
networks remains difficult. In this work, we present a new diffusion-based
generative model that designs protein backbone structures via a procedure that
mirrors the native folding process. We describe protein backbone structure as a
series of consecutive angles capturing the relative orientation of the
constituent amino acid residues, and generate new structures by denoising from
a random, unfolded state towards a stable folded structure. Not only does this
mirror how proteins biologically twist into energetically favorable
conformations, the inherent shift and rotational invariance of this
representation crucially alleviates the need for complex equivariant networks.
We train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model with a simple transformer
backbone and demonstrate that our resulting model unconditionally generates
highly realistic protein structures with complexity and structural patterns
akin to those of naturally-occurring proteins. As a useful resource, we release
the first open-source codebase and trained models for protein structure
diffusion.

luminosity, while most of the energy consumed by high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders
is proportional to the total beam current. Thus, the energy efficiency is
mainly determined by the specific luminosity that needs to be maximized. One of
the most effective ways to achieve this is by using the Crab waist collision
scheme, which implies a large Piwinski angle (LPA). A distinctive feature of
the FCC-ee is the great influence of beamstrahlung (radiation in the field of
an opposite bunch) on beam dynamics. At low energies, this manifests itself in
a significant increase in the energy spread and bunch length, at high energies,
in a limitation of the beam lifetime. The collision of intense bunches with LPA
and beamstrahlung can also lead to various kinds of instabilities limiting the
luminosity. Here, we discuss the main aspects to consider when optimizing the
parameters of the FCC-ee collider at different energies and explain the choice
of basic parameters such as RF voltage, lattice functions at IP, bunch
intensity, etc. We will also pay attention to open issues requiring further
study and identify some key points for the next phase of this project.

ambiguity-neutral, since they act in new situations as if the uncertainty were

orientation and reconstruction in the implicit space and propose a novel
approach to orient point cloud normals by incorporating isovalue constraints to
the Poisson equation. In implicit surface reconstruction, the reconstructed
shape is represented as an isosurface of an implicit function defined in the

Poisson equation, we propose an optimization formulation that combines isovalue
constraints with local consistency requirements for normals. We optimize
normals and implicit functions simultaneously and solve for a globally

can work on an average laptop with reasonable computational time. Experiments
show that our method can achieve high performance in non-uniform and noisy data

efficient parameterization based on neural optimal transport maps and propose a
novel algorithmic scheme through a cycle-consistent training procedure. We

implementation of Semi-VFL. Specifically, we build an inference-efficient
single-party student model applicable to the whole sample space and meanwhile
maintain the advantage of the federated feature extension. Novel feature
imitation and ranking consistency restriction methods are proposed to extract
cross-party feature correlations and maintain cross-sample-space consistency
for both the overlapped and non-overlapped data.
  We conducted extensive experiments on real-world advertising datasets. The
results show that our method achieves the best performance over baseline
methods and validate its effectiveness in maintaining cross-view feature
correlation.

  https://vivianszf.github.io/geod",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  3D-aware image synthesis aims at learning a generative model that can render
photo-realistic 2D images while capturing decent underlying 3D shapes. A
popular solution is to adopt the generative adversarial network (GAN) and
replace the generator with a 3D renderer, where volume rendering with neural
radiance field (NeRF) is commonly used. Despite the advancement of synthesis
quality, existing methods fail to obtain moderate 3D shapes. We argue that,
considering the two-player game in the formulation of GANs, only making the
generator 3D-aware is not enough. In other words, displacing the generative
mechanism only offers the capability, but not the guarantee, of producing
3D-aware images, because the supervision of the generator primarily comes from
the discriminator. To address this issue, we propose GeoD through learning a
geometry-aware discriminator to improve 3D-aware GANs. Concretely, besides
differentiating real and fake samples from the 2D image space, the
discriminator is additionally asked to derive the geometry information from the
inputs, which is then applied as the guidance of the generator. Such a simple
yet effective design facilitates learning substantially more accurate 3D
shapes. Extensive experiments on various generator architectures and training
datasets verify the superiority of GeoD over state-of-the-art alternatives.
Moreover, our approach is registered as a general framework such that a more
capable discriminator (i.e., with a third task of novel view synthesis beyond
domain classification and geometry extraction) can further assist the generator
with a better multi-view consistency.

coupled microtoroidal cavities considering two different types of couplings,
namely i) via a bridge qubit and ii) via evanescent fields. The cavities
support two counter-propagating whispering-gallery modes (WGMs) that may also
interact with each other. We firstly show that it is possible to transfer, with
high fidelity, a maximally entangled state between the two modes of the first
cavity (cavity 1) to the two modes of the second cavity (cavity 2),
independently of the type of coupling. Interesting differences, though, arise
concerning the generation of entangled states from initial product states; if
the cavities are coupled via a bridge qubit, we show that it is possible to
generate a 4-partite entangled state involving all four cavity modes. On the
other hand, contrarily to what happens in the qubit coupling case, it is
possible to generate bipartite maximally entangled states between modes of
different cavities from initial separable states for cavities coupled by
evanescent waves. Besides, we show that different entangled states between the
propagating and counter-propagating modes of distinct cavities may be generated
by tuning the interaction between modes belonging to the same cavity
(intra-cavity couplings). Again, this is possible only for the couplings via
evanescent waves. For the completion of our work, we discuss the effects of
losses on the dynamics of the system.

analytically that this energy transfer is larger than predicted by the standard
formalism. As the orbit of the companion shrinks, the mass it encloses becomes
smaller, and the companion is less bound than if the enclosed mass had remained
constant. Therefore, more energy must be transferred to the envelope for the
orbit to shrink further. We derive a revised energy formalism that accounts for
this effect, and discuss its consequences in two contexts: the formation of
neutron star binaries, and the engulfment of planets and brown dwarfs by their
host stars. The companion mass required to eject the stellar envelope is
smaller by up to $50\%$, leading to differences in common-envelope evolution
outcomes. The energy deposition in the outer envelope of the star, which is
related to the transient luminosity and duration, is up to a factor of
$\approx7$ higher. Common-envelope efficiency values above unity, as defined in
the literature, are thus not necessarily unphysical, and result at least partly

of freedom and the correlation between the sub-systems of a physical system.
Using the replica trick, we can obtain the EE by evaluating the entanglement
Renyi entropy (ERE). The ERE is a $q$-analogue of the EE and expressed by the
$q$ replicated partition function. In the semi-classical approximation, it is
apparently easy to calculate the EE because the classical action represents the
partition function by the saddle point approximation and we do not need to
perform the path integral for the evaluation of the partition function. In
previous studies, it has been assumed that only the minimal-valued saddle point
contributes to the EE. In this paper, we propose that all the saddle points
contribute equally to the EE by dealing carefully with the semi-classical limit
and then the $q \to 1$ limit. For example, we numerically evaluate the ERE of
two disjoint intervals for the large $c$ Liouville field theory with $q \sim
1$. We exploit the BPZ equation with the four twist operators, whose solution
is given by the Heun function. We determine the ERE by tuning the behavior of
the Heun function such that it becomes consistent with the geometry of the
replica manifold. We find the same two saddle points as previous studies for $q
\sim 1$ in the above system. Then, we provide the ERE for the large but finite
$c$ and the $q \sim 1$ in case that all the saddle points contribute equally to
the ERE. Based on this work, it shall be of interest to reconsider EE in other
semi-classical physical systems with multiple saddle points.

boundary entanglement. In quantum information science, causal structures can be
replaced by distributed entanglement for the purposes of information
processing. In this work, we deepen the understanding of both of these
statements, and their relationship, with a number of new results. Centrally, we
present and prove a new theorem, the $n$-to-$n$ connected wedge theorem, which
considers $n$ input and $n$ output locations at the boundary of an
asymptotically AdS$_{2+1}$ spacetime described by AdS/CFT. When a sufficiently
strong set of causal connections exists among these points in the bulk, a set
of $n$ associated regions in the boundary will have extensive-in-N mutual
information across any bipartition of the regions. The proof holds in three
bulk dimensions for classical spacetimes satisfying the null curvature
condition and for semiclassical spacetimes satisfying standard conjectures. The
$n$-to-$n$ connected wedge theorem gives a precise example of how causal
connections in a bulk state can emerge from large-N entanglement features of
its boundary dual. It also has consequences for quantum information theory: it
reveals one pattern of entanglement which is sufficient for information
processing in a particular class of causal networks. We argue this pattern is
also necessary, and give an AdS/CFT inspired protocol for information
processing in this setting.
  Our theorem generalizes the $2$-to-$2$ connected wedge theorem proven in

particular a false claim that existing proof techniques work above three bulk

  couplings in the type-I two-Higgs-doublet model","Final version to appear in PRD",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.107.015025",,"hep-ph hep-ex","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The type-I two-Higgs-doublet model in the inverted Higgs scenario can retain
the theoretical stability all the way up to the Planck scale. The Planck-cutoff
scale, $\Lambda_{\rm cut}^{\rm Planck}$, directly impacts the mass spectra such
that all the extra Higgs boson masses should be light below about 160 GeV.
However, the observation of the light masses of new Higgs bosons does not
indicate the high cutoff scale because a low cutoff scale can also accommodate
the light masses. Over the viable parameter points that satisfy the theoretical
requirements and the experimental constraints, we show that the trilinear Higgs
couplings for low $\Lambda_{\rm cut}$ are entirely different from those for the
Planck-cutoff scale. The most sensitive coupling to the cutoff scale is from
the $h$-$h$-$h$ vertex, where $h$ is the lighter CP-even Higgs boson at a mass
below 125 GeV. Among the multi-Higgs productions mediated by Higgs bosons, the
gluon fusion processes of $gg \to h h $ and $gg \to AA$ are insensitive to the
cutoff scale, yielding a small variation of $\mathcal{O}(1)\,{\rm fb}$
according to $\Lambda_{\rm cut}$. The smoking-gun signature is from the triple
Higgs production of $q\bar{q}' \to W^* \to H^\pm hh$, which solely depends on
the $h$-$h$-$h$ vertex. The cross section for $\Lambda_{\rm cut}=1\,{\rm TeV}$
is about $10^3$ times larger than that for the Planck-cutoff scale. Since the
decay modes of $H^\pm \to W^* h/W^* A$ and $h/A \to bb$ are dominant, the
process yields the $6b+\ell\nu$ final state, which enjoys an almost
background-free environment. Consequently, the precision measurement of $pp \to
H^\pm hh$ can probe the cutoff scale of the model.

implicit time-stepping schemes, as the precomputed operators can be reused for
fast elliptic solves on surfaces. On a standard laptop, precomputation for a
12th-order surface mesh with over 1 million degrees of freedom takes 17
seconds, while subsequent solves take only 0.25 seconds. We apply the method to
a range of problems on both smooth surfaces and surfaces with sharp corners and

edge representations for the original network can be computed with efficient

vertex $x$ is defined as $\epsilon_{G}(x)= \max\{d_{G}(x,y)|y\in V(G)\}$. The

connectivity to static and mobile ground users in situations of increased
network demand or points-of-failure in existing terrestrial cellular
infrastructure. However, UAVs are energy-constrained and may experience
interference from nearby UAV cells sharing the same frequency spectrum, thereby
impacting the system's energy efficiency (EE). We aim to address research gaps
that focus on optimising the system's EE using a 2D trajectory optimisation of
UAVs serving only static ground users, and neglect the impact of interference
from nearby UAV cells. Unlike previous work that assume global spatial
knowledge of ground users' location via a central controller that periodically
scans the network perimeter and provides real-time updates to the UAVs for
decision making, we focus on a realistic decentralised approach suitable in
emergencies. Thus, we apply a decentralised Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL) approach that maximizes the system's EE by jointly optimising each UAV's
3D trajectory, number of connected static and mobile users, and the energy
consumed, while taking into account the impact of interference and the UAVs'
coordination on the system's EE in a dynamic network environment. To address
this, we propose a direct collaborative Communication-enabled Multi-Agent
Decentralised Double Deep Q-Network (CMAD-DDQN) approach. The CMAD-DDQN is a
collaborative algorithm that allows UAVs to explicitly share knowledge by
communicating with its nearest neighbours based on existing 3GPP guidelines.
Our approach is able to maximise the system's EE without degrading the coverage
performance in the network. Simulation results show that the proposed approach
outperforms existing baselines in term of maximising the systems' EE by about
15% - 85%.

due to the lack of a unique and straightforward relationship between seismic

direct end-to-end link using supervised machine learning techniques, but face
different challenges such as a lack of large petrophysical training dataset or
estimates that may not conform with physics or depositional history of the
rocks. We present a rock and wave physics informed neural network (RW-PINN)
model that can estimate porosity directly from seismic image traces with no or
limited number of wells, with predictions that are consistent with rock physics
and geologic knowledge of deposition. As an example, we use the uncemented sand
rock physics model and normal-incidence wave physics to guide the learning of
RW-PINN to eventually get good estimates of porosities from normal-incidence
seismic traces and limited well data. Training RW-PINN with few wells (weakly
supervised) helps in tackling the problem of non-uniqueness as different
porosity logs can give similar seismic traces. We use weighted normalized root
mean square error loss function to train the weakly supervised network and
demonstrate the impact of different weights on porosity predictions. The
RW-PINN estimated porosities and seismic traces are compared to predictions
from a completely supervised model, which gives slightly better porosity
estimates but poorly matches the seismic traces, in addition to requiring a
large amount of labeled training data. In this paper, we demonstrate the
complete workflow for executing petrophysical inversion of seismic data using
self-supervised or weakly supervised rock physics informed neural networks.

form of the momentum density and naturally induces a flow on the energy density

  Framework Investigated in Smart Grids",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Smart energy performance monitoring and optimisation at the supplier and
consumer levels is essential to realising smart cities. In order to implement a
more sustainable energy management plan, it is crucial to conduct a better
energy forecast. The next-generation smart meters can also be used to measure,
record, and report energy consumption data, which can be used to train machine
learning (ML) models for predicting energy needs. However, sharing fine-grained
energy data and performing centralised learning may compromise users' privacy
and leave them vulnerable to several attacks. This study addresses this issue
by utilising federated learning (FL), an emerging technique that performs ML
model training at the user level, where data resides. We introduce FedTrees, a
new, lightweight FL framework that benefits from the outstanding features of
ensemble learning. Furthermore, we developed a delta-based early stopping
algorithm to monitor FL training and stop it when it does not need to continue.
The simulation results demonstrate that FedTrees outperforms the most popular
federated averaging (FedAvg) framework and the baseline Persistence model for
providing accurate energy forecasting patterns while taking only 2% of the
computation time and 13% of the communication rounds compared to FedAvg, saving
considerable amounts of computation and communication resources.

model, the most informative data points for annotation to estimate the
evaluation metric. However, we find that their estimation can be biased and
only relies on the labeled data. To that end, we introduce CEREAL, a
comprehensive framework for few-sample clustering evaluation that extends
active sampling approaches in three key ways. First, we propose novel NMI-based
acquisition functions that account for the distinctive properties of clustering
and uncertainties from a learned surrogate model. Next, we use ideas from
semi-supervised learning and train the surrogate model with both the labeled

CEREAL reduces the area under the absolute error curve by up to 57% compared to
the best sampling baseline. We perform an extensive ablation study to show that

text document; for example: what effect does writing a polite vs. rude email
have on response time? To estimate a causal effect from observational data, we
need to adjust for confounding aspects of the text that affect both the
treatment and outcome -- e.g., the topic or writing level of the text. These
confounding aspects are unknown a priori, so it seems natural to adjust for the
entirety of the text (e.g., using a transformer). However, causal
identification and estimation procedures rely on the assumption of overlap: for
all levels of the adjustment variables, there is randomness leftover so that
every unit could have (not) received treatment. Since the treatment here is
itself an attribute of the text, it is perfectly determined, and overlap is
apparently violated. The purpose of this paper is to show how to handle causal
identification and obtain robust causal estimation in the presence of apparent
overlap violations. In brief, the idea is to use supervised representation
learning to produce a data representation that preserves confounding
information while eliminating information that is only predictive of the
treatment. This representation then suffices for adjustment and can satisfy
overlap. Adapting results on non-parametric estimation, we find that this
procedure is robust to conditional outcome misestimation, yielding a low-bias
estimator with valid uncertainty quantification under weak conditions.
Empirical results show strong improvements in bias and uncertainty
quantification relative to the natural baseline.

Proton Synchrotron (SPS). According to the linearized Vlasov theory, radial or
azimuthal mode-coupling instabilities result from a coupling of
bunch-oscillation modes, which belong to either the same or adjacent azimuthal
modes, respectively. We show that both instability mechanisms exist in the SPS
by applying the Oide-Yokoya approach to compute van Kampen modes for the
realistic longitudinal impedance model of the SPS. The results agree with
macroparticle simulations and are consistent with beam measurements. In
particular, we see that the uncontrolled longitudinal emittance blow-up of
single bunches observed before the recent impedance reduction campaign
(2018-2021) is due to the radial mode-coupling instability. Unexpectedly, this
instability is as strong as the azimuthal mode-coupling instability, which is
possible in the SPS for other combinations of bunch length and intensity. We
also demonstrate the significant role of rf nonlinearity and potential-well
distortion in determining these instability thresholds. Finally, we discuss the
effect of the recent impedance reduction campaign on beam stability in single-
and double-rf configurations.

Although many graph few-shot learning (GFL) methods have been developed to

a general purpose as their designs are coupled with task or data-specific

pre-trains a graph encoder with contrastive learning using unlabeled data.
Later, the trained encoder is frozen as a teacher model to distill a student
model with a contrastive loss. The distilled model is finally fed to GFL. CGFL
learns data representation in a self-supervised manner, thus mitigating the
distribution shift impact for better generalization and making model task and
data-independent for a general graph mining purpose. Furthermore, we introduce
an information-based method to quantitatively measure the capability of CGFL.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CGFL outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines on several graph mining tasks in the few-shot scenario. We also

of a recently released ring gantry linac in Geant4 (Version 10.7) for secondary
dose validation of radiotherapy plan. Methods: For the Halcyon (Varian Medical
Systems), the DSMLC was modeled and radiation transport in DSMLC and patient
phantom was simulated using Geant4. Radiation source was sampled from a phase
space file for linac head above the DSMLC. The phase space file was obtained
using a cloud-based Monte Carlo (MC) simulator, VirtuaLinac (VL) provide by
Varian. Dosimetric profiles for different square field widths (2x2, 4x4, 6x6,
8x8, 10x10, 20x20, and 28x28 cm2), i.e., percent depth dose (PDD) curves and
lateral profiles are simulated and compared against the experimental profiles.
IMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy) plans in two anatomical sites
(prostate and brain) were also calculated using the developed toolkit and
compared against the TPS calculated dose (Acuros, Eclipse 15.6). 3D dose
difference and 3D gamma analysis were used to evaluate the simulation accuracy
compared against the TPS calculated dose. Results: The simulated lateral dose
profiles and PDD curves in water phantom match well with the measured ones for
all the simulated field sizes with relative difference +-2%. For the prostate
and brain IMRT plans, the simulated dose showed a good agreement with the TPS
calculated dose. The 3D gamma pass rate (3%/3mm) are 98.08% and 95.4% for the
two prostate and brain plans, respectively. Conclusion: The developed full MC
dose calculation toolkit for Halcyon performs well in dose calculations in
water phantom and patient CT phantom. The developed toolkit shows promising
possibility for future secondary dose calculation for IMRT and serve as
clinical quality assurance (QA) tool for Halcyon.

novel dual-query co-attention network that uses two types of queries, including

the temporal context features extracted from the adjacent feature maps and then
aggregates S-QS with T-QS using a gated attention mechanism. The dual queries
are updated through multiple attention layers to progressively enhance the
target frame features used to produce the detection results. Our experiments on

their scope to one. Under large confinement, a geometric model has been
proposed to predict the gross shape of the sheet, which averages out the fine
features. However, the actual meaning of the gross shape, and how it constrains
the fine features, remains unclear. Here, we study a thin-membraned balloon as
a prototypical system that involves a doubly curved gross shape with large

a NACA0012 airfoil at zero angle of attack. Particle swarm optimization is used
to find the optimized airfoil configuration. The multi-objective optimization
minimizes the A-weighted overall sound pressure level at various angles of

parametrization methods to define the airfoil geometry (i.e., CST) to a machine
learning method (i.e., a variational autoencoder). We observe that variational
autoencoders can represent a wide variety of geometries, with only four encoded
variables, leading to efficient optimizations, which result in improved optimal
shapes. When compared to the baseline geometry, a NACA0012, the
autoencoder-based optimized airfoil reduces by 3% (1.75 dBA) the overall sound

maintaining favorable aerodynamic properties in terms of lift and drag.

extremely time consuming. This is attributed to overheads caused by sparse
matrix multiplication, which are sidestepped when training multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) with only node features. MLPs, by ignoring graph context,
are simple and faster for graph data, however they usually sacrifice prediction
accuracy, limiting their applications for graph data. We observe that for most
message passing-based GNNs, we can trivially derive an analog MLP (we call this
a PeerMLP) with an equivalent weight space, by setting the trainable parameters
with the same shapes, making us curious about \textbf{\emph{how do GNNs using
weights from a fully trained PeerMLP perform?}} Surprisingly, we find that GNNs
initialized with such weights significantly outperform their PeerMLPs,
motivating us to use PeerMLP training as a precursor, initialization step to
GNN training. To this end, we propose an embarrassingly simple, yet hugely
effective initialization method for GNN training acceleration, called MLPInit.
Our extensive experiments on multiple large-scale graph datasets with diverse
GNN architectures validate that MLPInit can accelerate the training of GNNs (up
to 33X speedup on OGB-Products) and often improve prediction performance (e.g.,
up to $7.97\%$ improvement for GraphSAGE across $7$ datasets for node
classification, and up to $17.81\%$ improvement across $4$ datasets for link
prediction on metric Hits@10). The code is available at

ASAS-SN data and determined new periods for their variability. The older and
newer period values were compared to investigate evidence of period change, for
which there is theoretical support that it might be detectable in a decade or
two in some cases. Such a detection is challenging since the light curves are
complicated, with multiple periods, changing amplitudes, and evidence of
shocks. Nevertheless, we found one, and possibly two, such cases, which are
associated with the higher temperature stars in the sample (7250 and 8000 K).
These results are most consistent with the evolution of stars at the lower end
of the mass range of carbon stars, ~1.5-2 M(sun). Several of the stars show
longer-term trends of increasing (six cases) or decreasing (one case)
brightness, which we think most likely due to changes in the circumstellar dust
opacity. There is one case of a possible ~1.8 yr period in addition to the
shorter pulsation. This is interpreted as possible evidence of an orbiting

like photon splitting and magnetic pair creation. In this paper, we compute the
opacities due to photon splitting and pair creation by photons emitted anywhere
in the magnetosphere of a magnetar. Axisymmetric, twisted dipole field
configurations embedded in the Schwarzschild metric are treated. The paper
computes the maximum energies for photon transparency that permit propagation
to infinity in curved spacetime. Special emphasis is given to cases where
photons are generated along magnetic field loops and/or in polar regions; these
cases directly relate to resonant inverse Compton scattering models for the
hard X-ray emission from magnetars and Comptonized soft gamma-ray emission from
giant flares. We find that increases in magnetospheric twists raise or lower
photon opacities, depending on both the emission locale, and the competition
between field line straightening and field strength enhancement. Consequently,
given the implicit spectral transparency of hard X-ray bursts and persistent
""tail"" emission of magnetars, photon splitting considerations constrain their
emission region locales and the twist angle of the magnetosphere; these
constraints can be probed by future soft gamma-ray telescopes such as COSI and
AMEGO. The inclusion of twists generally increases the opaque volume of pair
creation by photons above its threshold, except when photons are emitted in
polar regions and approximately parallel to the field.

agreement with the inverse relationship between sub-burst slope and duration
and with other predictions made by the triggered relativistic dynamical model

different repeating FRB sources. For this sample of bursts, we find that the
sub-burst slope as well as the 'sad trombone' drift rate are consistent with

decreases with increasing frequency as well as a statistically significant
correlation between the sub-burst duration and bandwidth (proportional to
$t^{-1/2}$) that is unexpected. No distinct group of bursts in this sample
deviated from these relationships, however significant scatter can be seen in

designed to explain them. Most explanation methods explain a scalar model

elements of which are not good candidates to explain because they lack semantic
meaning. To bridge this gap, recent works defined a scalar explanation output:
a dot product-based similarity in the representation space to the sample being
explained (i.e., an explicand). Although this enabled explanations of
unsupervised models, the interpretation of this approach can still be opaque
because similarity to the explicand's representation may not be meaningful to
humans. To address this, we propose contrastive corpus similarity, a novel and
semantically meaningful scalar explanation output based on a reference corpus
and a contrasting foil set of samples. We demonstrate that contrastive corpus
similarity is compatible with many post-hoc feature attribution methods to
generate COntrastive COrpus Attributions (COCOA) and quantitatively verify that

continuous arrival time to find path solutions informed by a nonlinear
first-order PDE called Eikonal Equation. We evaluate our method in various
cluttered 3D environments, including the Gibson dataset, and demonstrate its
ability to solve motion planning problems for 4-DOF and 6-DOF robot
manipulators where the traditional grid-based Eikonal planners often face the
curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, the results show that our method exhibits
high success rates and significantly lower computational times than the
state-of-the-art methods, including NMPs that require training data from
classical planners.

between concepts and are critical for intelligent decision making in enterprise
applications. New knowledge is inferred from the existing facts in the
knowledge graphs by encoding the concepts and relations into low-dimensional
feature vector representations. The most effective representations for this
task, called Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), are learned through neural
network architectures. Due to their impressive predictive performance, they are
increasingly used in high-impact domains like healthcare, finance and
education. However, are the black-box KGE models adversarially robust for use
in domains with high stakes? This thesis argues that state-of-the-art KGE
models are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, that is, their predictive
performance can be degraded by systematically crafted perturbations to the
training knowledge graph. To support this argument, two novel data poisoning
attacks are proposed that craft input deletions or additions at training time
to subvert the learned model's performance at inference time. These adversarial
attacks target the task of predicting the missing facts in knowledge graphs
using KGE models, and the evaluation shows that the simpler attacks are
competitive with or outperform the computationally expensive ones. The thesis
contributions not only highlight and provide an opportunity to fix the security
vulnerabilities of KGE models, but also help to understand the black-box

disc robots in a polygonal environment. We assume that the robots have
revolving areas around their start and final positions: that each start and
each final is contained in a radius $2$ disc lying in the free space, not
necessarily concentric with the start or final position, which is free from
other start or final positions. This assumption allows a weakly-monotone motion
plan, in which robots move according to an ordering as follows: during the turn
of a robot $R$ in the ordering, it moves fully from its start to final
position, while other robots do not leave their revolving areas. As $R$ passes
through a revolving area, a robot $R'$ that is inside this area may move within
the revolving area to avoid a collision. Notwithstanding the existence of a
motion plan, we show that minimizing the total traveled distance in this
setting, specifically even when the motion plan is restricted to be
weakly-monotone, is APX-hard, ruling out any polynomial-time
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm.
  On the positive side, we present the first constant-factor approximation
algorithm for computing a feasible weakly-monotone motion plan. The total
distance traveled by the robots is within an $O(1)$ factor of that of the
optimal motion plan, which need not be weakly monotone. Our algorithm extends
to an online setting in which the polygonal environment is fixed but the
initial and final positions of robots are specified in an online manner.
Finally, we observe that the overhead in the overall cost that we add while
editing the paths to avoid robot-robot collision can vary significantly
depending on the ordering we chose. Finding the best ordering in this respect
is known to be NP-hard, and we provide a polynomial time $O(\log n \log \log

Project page: http://www.cs.columbia.edu/cg/INSR-PDE/",,,,"cs.LG cs.CE cs.GR cs.NA math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Implicit Neural Spatial Representation (INSR) has emerged as an effective
representation of spatially-dependent vector fields. This work explores solving
time-dependent PDEs with INSR. Classical PDE solvers introduce both temporal
and spatial discretizations. Common spatial discretizations include meshes and
meshless point clouds, where each degree-of-freedom corresponds to a location
in space. While these explicit spatial correspondences are intuitive to model
and understand, these representations are not necessarily optimal for accuracy,
memory usage, or adaptivity. Keeping the classical temporal discretization
unchanged (e.g., explicit/implicit Euler), we explore INSR as an alternative
spatial discretization, where spatial information is implicitly stored in the
neural network weights. The network weights then evolve over time via time
integration. Our approach does not require any training data generated by
existing solvers because our approach is the solver itself. We validate our
approach on various PDEs with examples involving large elastic deformations,
turbulent fluids, and multi-scale phenomena. While slower to compute than
traditional representations, our approach exhibits higher accuracy and lower
memory consumption. Whereas classical solvers can dynamically adapt their
spatial representation only by resorting to complex remeshing algorithms, our
INSR approach is intrinsically adaptive. By tapping into the rich literature of
classic time integrators, e.g., operator-splitting schemes, our method enables
challenging simulations in contact mechanics and turbulent flows where previous
neural-physics approaches struggle. Videos and codes are available on the

disaster response. Robots are increasingly being used in hazardous environment
industries and emergency response teams to perform various tasks. Operational
decision-making in such applications requires a complex semantic understanding
of environments that are remote from the human operator. Low-level sensory data
from the robot is transformed into perception and informative cognition.
Currently, such cognition is predominantly performed by a human expert, who
monitors remote sensor data such as robot video feeds. This engenders a need
for AI-generated semantic understanding capabilities on the robot itself.
Current work on semantics and AI lies towards the relatively academic end of
the research spectrum, hence relatively removed from the practical realities of
first responder teams. We aim for this paper to be a step towards bridging this
divide. We first review common robot tasks in disaster response and the types
of information such robots must collect. We then organize the types of semantic
features and understanding that may be useful in disaster operations into a
taxonomy of semantic information. We also briefly review the current
state-of-the-art semantic understanding techniques. We highlight potential
synergies, but we also identify gaps that need to be bridged to apply these
ideas. We aim to stimulate the research that is needed to adapt, robustify, and
implement state-of-the-art AI semantics methods in the challenging conditions
of disasters and first responder scenarios.

the ratios of women in Free and open-source software (FOSS) communities are

hint the existence of biases against women, it is unclear to what extent such
biases influence the outcomes of various software development tasks.
  Aim: We aim to identify whether the outcomes of or participation in code
reviews (or pull requests) are influenced by the gender of a developer..
  Approach: With this goal, this study includes a total 1010 FOSS projects. We
developed six regression models for each of the 14 dataset (i.e., 10 Gerrit
based and four Github) to identify if code acceptance, review intervals, and
code review participation differ based on the gender and gender neutral profile
of a developer.
  Key findings: Our results find significant gender biases during code
acceptance among 13 out of the 14 datasets, with seven seven favoring men and
the remaining six favoring women. We also found significant differences between
men and women in terms of code review intervals, with women encountering longer
delays in three cases and the opposite in seven. Our results indicate reviewer
selection as one of the most gender biased aspects among most of the projects,
with women having significantly lower code review participation among 11 out of
the 14 cases. Since most of the review assignments are based on invitations,
this result suggests possible affinity biases among the developers.
  Conclusion: Though gender bias exists among many projects, direction and
amplitude of bias varies based on project size, community and culture. Similar
bias mitigation strategies may not work across all communities, as
characteristics of biases and their underlying causes differ.

light-induced birefringence (LIB) exhibits slow relaxation tendency up to about
10 s suggesting on anisotropic photorefractive effect evidently dominated fast
Kerr effect. This behavior is evaluated in the light of other results reported
recently and is explained by the glass polymerization mechanisms. The
photorefractive birefringence increases with increase of the quantity of NiO up
to 0.8 mol% and it is attributed to the enhanced degree of depolymerization of
the glass network due to the hike in the concentration of Ni2+ ions that occupy
octahedral (Oh) positions. Further increase of NiO content (>0.8 mol%) causes,
however, a certain decrease of the photorefractive birefringence. Notable
change in concentration trend is interpreted by rising of phonon losses due to
increasing portion of the nickel ions occupying tetrahedral (Th) sites that
facilitates the polymerization of the glass network. The doped glasses with the
NiO content of about 0.8 mol% may be considered as optimal in the sense of
photorefractive efficiency. Relevant samples exhibit largest magnitudes of the
photorefractive birefringence and appear to be favorable for potential
applications.

  applications",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Actuator self-heating limits the achievable force and can cause unwanted
structural deformations. This is especially apparent in quasi-static actuation
systems that require the actuator to maintain a stable position over an
extended period. As a solution, we use the concept of a Tunable Magnet. Tunable
magnets rely on in-situ magnetization state tuning of AlNico to create an
infinitely adjustable magnetic flux. They consist of an AlNiCo low coercivity
permanent magnet together with a magnetizing coil. After tuning, the AlNiCo
retains its magnetic field without further energy input, which eliminates the
static heat dissipation. To enable implementation in actuation systems, the
AlNiCo needs to be robustly tunable in the presence of a varying system
air-gap. We achieve this by implementing a magnetization state tuning method,
based on a magnetic circuit model of the actuator, measured AlNiCo BH data and
air-gap flux feedback control. The proposed tuning method consists of 2 main
steps. The prediction step, during which the required magnet operating point is
determined, and the demagnetization step, where a feedback controller drives a
demagnetization current to approach this operating point. With this method
implemented for an AlNiCo 5 tunable magnet in a reluctance actuator
configuration, we achieve tuning with a maximum error of 15.86 ""mT"" and a
minimum precision of 0.67 ""mT"" over an air-gap range of 200 ""{\mu}m"". With this
tuning accuracy, actuator heating during static periods is almost eliminated.
Only a small bias current is needed to compensate for the tuning error.

boundaries (IB). In this strategy, called Volume-Filtering Immersed Boundary
(VFIB) method, transport equations are derived by filtering the Navier-Stokes
equations and accounting for stresses at the solid-fluid interface. The result
is that boundary conditions that normally apply on the interface are
transformed into bodyforces that apply on the right-hand side of the filtered
transport equations. The filter width acts as a parameter that controls the
level of resolution. The IB is considered well-resolved if the filter width is
much smaller than the characteristic corrugation scale of the interface. There
are several innovations in this IB method. First, it sheds light on the role of
the internal flow which arises when the transport equations are solved inside
the IB. We show that, it is essential to separate stresses due to the external
and internal fluids in order to get accurate forces and provide a method to do
so. Second, we show that volumes associated with Lagrangian forcing points on
the boundary depend on the local topology of the surface. We provide a method
to compute these volumes using a triangle tessellation of the interface and the
surface density function. Third, we provide an efficient procedure to compute
the solid volume fraction, thus, enabling tagging interior/exterior cells. This
volume fraction is also involved in the procedure to separate stresses due to
the external fluid from the total stresses. Fourth, we show a path forward to
extend the VFIB method to Large Eddy Simulations involving IBs. Lastly, we
apply the VFIB in several numerical tests involving two- and three- dimensional
static and moving IBs. We show greatly improved results compared to prior IB
methods. Further, we test several filter kernels and show that, for
well-resolved IBs, the choice of the kernel plays little role.

bistability between an Earth-like climate state with efficient carbon
sequestration and an alternative stable climate equilibrium where CO$_2$
condenses at the surface and forms a blanket of either clathrate hydrate or
liquid CO$_2$. At increasing instellation and with ineffective weathering, the
latter state oscillates between cool, surface CO$_2$-condensing and hot,
non-condensing climates. CO$_2$ bistable climates may emerge early in planetary

model leads to two risk-aware cost formulations that account for the worst-case
expected cost and traction. To help the learned model generalize to unseen

detected via a density estimator fit to the trained network's latent space and
avoided via auxiliary penalties during planning. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed approach outperforms existing work that assumes no slip or

Furthermore, avoiding terrains with low density-based confidence score achieves
up to 30% improvement in success rate when the learned traction model is used

identification problems, such as meter phase identification and

voltage correlations between meters are calculated to determine which phase a
meter is on and which transformer it is supplied by. The underlying assumption
is that voltage profiles of meters supplied by the same distribution
transformer or on the same phase are strongly correlated. In this paper, we
first derive that i) when two customers consume at different power levels, the
voltage drops on the secondary circuits that connect the customers to the
transformer can be significant, and ii) large secondary circuit voltage drops
can significantly weaken the voltage correlation between meters on the same
phase or supplied by the same transformer. Based on this discovery, we proposed
a data segmentation based approach that uses power bands for highly correlated
voltage segment selection in order to minimize correlation deterioration. Thus,
instead of using the entire voltage waveforms, we use an ensemble of voltage
segments for voltage correlation calculation. The proposed methods are
developed and tested on both synthetic and real feeder data sets for two
algorithms: meter phase and transformer-meter pairing identification.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness.

spectrum and the detector's response matrix also known as the transfer matrix.
We demonstrate that the technique can help access information about the shell

that isn't immediately accessible via traditional approaches such as chi-square
fitting. For a similar purpose, we developed a machine learning model that uses
a deep neural network (DNN) classifier to identify resonance states from the

studies show that the Pearson Correlation Coefficient between ${\bm V}_n$ and
event-wise mean transverse momentum $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$, $\rho_{n}({\bm
V}_n,[p_{\mathrm{T}}])$ can probe number and size of sources, nuclear
deformation, volume fluctuation, and initial momentum anisotropy in initial

measurements of ${\bm V}_n-[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$ correlation in
$^{\mathrm{129}}\mathrm{Xe}+^{\mathrm{129}}\mathrm{Xe}$ and
$^{\mathrm{208}}\mathrm{Pb}+^{\mathrm{208}}\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions for
harmonics $n=2$, 3, and 4 using the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The values of
$\rho_{n}$ shows rich and non-monotonic dependence on centrality, $p_{T}$ and
$\eta$, reflecting that different ingredients of the initial state impact
different regions of the phase space. The ratio of $\rho_{2}$ between the two
systems in the ultra-central region suggests that ${^\mathrm{129}}\mathrm{Xe}$
has large quadrupole deformation and with a significant triaxiality. All
current models fail to describe many of the observed trends in the data.

  Representation Learning",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Even pruned by the state-of-the-art network compression methods, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) training upon non-Euclidean graph data often encounters
relatively higher time costs, due to its irregular and nasty density
properties, compared with data in the regular Euclidean space. Another natural
property concomitantly with graph is class-imbalance which cannot be alleviated
by the massive graph data while hindering GNNs' generalization. To fully tackle
these unpleasant properties, (i) theoretically, we introduce a hypothesis about
what extent a subset of the training data can approximate the full dataset's
learning effectiveness. The effectiveness is further guaranteed and proved by
the gradients' distance between the subset and the full set; (ii) empirically,
we discover that during the learning process of a GNN, some samples in the
training dataset are informative for providing gradients to update model
parameters. Moreover, the informative subset is not fixed during training
process. Samples that are informative in the current training epoch may not be
so in the next one. We also notice that sparse subnets pruned from a
well-trained GNN sometimes forget the information provided by the informative
subset, reflected in their poor performances upon the subset. Based on these
findings, we develop a unified data-model dynamic sparsity framework named
Graph Decantation (GraphDec) to address challenges brought by training upon a
massive class-imbalanced graph data. The key idea of GraphDec is to identify
the informative subset dynamically during the training process by adopting
sparse graph contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that GraphDec outperforms baselines for graph and node tasks, with
respect to classification accuracy and data usage efficiency.

85 lesions and 37 normal segments were analyzed. Manual annotation was done
using a dedicated software (OCTOPUS) previously developed by our group. Data
augmentation in the polar (r,{\theta}) domain was applied to raw IVOCT images
to ensure that microvessels appear at all possible angles. Pre-processing
methods included guidewire/shadow detection, lumen segmentation, pixel
shifting, and noise reduction. DeepLab v3+ was used to segment microvessel
candidates. A bounding box on each candidate was classified as either
microvessel or non-microvessel using a shallow convolutional neural network.
For better classification, we used data augmentation (i.e., angle rotation) on
bounding boxes with a microvessel during network training. Data augmentation
and pre-processing steps improved microvessel segmentation performance
significantly, yielding a method with Dice of 0.71+/-0.10 and pixel-wise
sensitivity/specificity of 87.7+/-6.6%/99.8+/-0.1%. The network for classifying
microvessels from candidates performed exceptionally well, with sensitivity of
99.5+/-0.3%, specificity of 98.8+/-1.0%, and accuracy of 99.1+/-0.5%. The
classification step eliminated the majority of residual false positives, and
the Dice coefficient increased from 0.71 to 0.73. In addition, our method
produced 698 image frames with microvessels present, compared to 730 from
manual analysis, representing a 4.4% difference. When compared to the manual

minimize the weighted mean square error between the received signal and the

Unlike most existing SLP schemes that rely on channel state information (CSI)
only, the proposed scheme exploits both CSI and the distribution information of
the noise to achieve improved performance. We firstly propose a simple generic
description of CIR that facilitates the subsequent SLP design. Such an
objective can further be formulated as a nonnegative least squares (NNLS)
problem, which can be solved efficiently by the active-set algorithm.
Furthermore, the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) precoding and the
existing SLP can be easily verified as special cases of the proposed scheme.
Finally, simulation results show that the proposed precoding outperforms the
state-of-the-art SLP schemes in full signal-to-noise ratio ranges in both
uncoded and coded systems without additional complexity over conventional SLP.

hyper-redundancy and dexterity. In this paper we demonstrate, for the first
time, closed-loop control of the configuration space variables of a soft
robotic arm, composed of independently controllable segments, using a Cosserat
rod model of the robot and the distributed sensing and actuation capabilities
of the segments. Our controller solves the inverse dynamic problem by
simulating the Cosserat rod model in MATLAB using a computationally efficient
numerical solution scheme, and it applies the computed control output to the
actual robot in real time. The position and orientation of the tip of each
segment are measured in real time, while the remaining unknown variables that
are needed to solve the inverse dynamics are estimated simultaneously in the
simulation. We implement the controller on a multi-segment silicone robotic arm
with pneumatic actuation, using a motion capture system to measure the
segments' positions and orientations. The controller is used to reshape the arm
into configurations that are achieved through different combinations of bending
and extension deformations in 3D space. The resulting tracking performance
indicates the effectiveness of the controller and the accuracy of the simulated
Cosserat rod model that is used to estimate the unmeasured variables.

camera poses to be pre-acquired by a structure-from-motion (SfM) approach. This
two-stage strategy is not convenient to use and degrades the performance
because the error in the pose extraction can propagate to the view synthesis.
We integrate the pose extraction and view synthesis into a single end-to-end
procedure so they can benefit from each other. For training NeRF models, only
RGB images are given, without pre-known camera poses. The camera poses are
obtained by the epipolar constraint in which the identical feature in different
views has the same world coordinates transformed from the local camera
coordinates according to the extracted poses. The epipolar constraint is
jointly optimized with pixel color constraint. The poses are represented by a
CNN-based deep network, whose input is the related frames. This joint
optimization enables NeRF to be aware of the scene's structure that has an
improved generalization performance. Extensive experiments on a variety of

over a decentralized network and propose a communication-efficient
decentralized Newton's method for solving it. We first apply dynamic average
consensus (DAC) so that each node is able to use a local gradient approximation
and a local Hessian approximation to track the global gradient and Hessian,
respectively. Second, since exchanging Hessian approximations is far from
communication-efficient, we require the nodes to exchange the compressed ones
instead and then apply an error compensation mechanism to correct for the
compression noise. Third, we introduce multi-step consensus for exchanging
local variables and local gradient approximations to balance between
computation and communication. To avoid each node transmitting the entire local
Hessian approximation, we design a compression procedure with error
compensation to estimate the global Hessian in a communication-efficient way.
With novel analysis, we establish the globally linear (resp., asymptotically
super-linear) convergence rate of the proposed method when m is constant
(resp., tends to infinity), where m is the number of consensus inner steps. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first super-linear convergence result
for a communication-efficient decentralized Newton's method. Moreover, the rate
we establish is provably faster than those of first-order methods. Our
numerical results on various applications corroborate the theoretical findings.

inversion transformation not only plays an essential role in solving quantum
systems but also can be used to manipulate and measure the motional quantum
states of such hybrid quantum systems as quantum Rabi model(QRM) and/or its
variants through parity measurements. Here we address an exotic parity behavior
of the QRM in its superradiant phase by numerical exact diagonalization,
namely, the parities of eigenstates of the QRM behave irregular in the strong
coupling regime but the sum of parities for each pair of eigenstates beginning
from the ground state remains vanishing. It is found that this exotic behavior
originates from the comparability of the photon distribution in the odd and
even components of Fock basis when the eigenenergies of each pair of
eigenstates approach enough to each other and physically is due to the emergent
double-well potential induced by the strong coupling between the single-mode
photon field and the two-level atom. The result not only uncovers the physics
not known previously in the QRM but also makes an intrinsic limitation on the
measurement precision of motional quantum states through parity measurements in

We predict that there can be a neutrino flare existing in the still to be

precessing jet is responsible for all three detected emission episodes. The
next flare is expected to peak in the period 01/2023 to 08/2026. Further

of this work was to develop a framework to enable biomedical engineers to
efficiently and reliably assess diagnostic distortion resulting from ECG
processing algorithms. We propose a semiautomatic framework for quantifying the
diagnostic resemblance between original and denoised/reconstructed ECGs.
Evaluation of the ECG must be done manually, but is kept simple and does not
require medical training. In a case study, we quantified the agreement between
raw and reconstructed (denoised) ECG recordings by means of kappa-based
statistical tests. The proposed methodology takes into account that the
observers may agree by chance alone. Consequently, for the case study, our
statistical analysis reports the ""true"", beyond-chance agreement in contrast to
other, less robust measures, such as simple percent agreement calculations. Our
framework allows efficient assessment of clinically important diagnostic
distortion, a potential side effect of ECG (pre-)processing algorithms.
Accurate quantification of a possible diagnostic loss is critical to any

Therefore, constructing an effective feature extraction and understanding

focus on word information, ignoring medical information in the text. Meanwhile,
some visual and textual feature understanding schemes cannot effectively
capture the correlation between regions and keywords for reasonable visual

coherency from flow-only input, due to the missing texture information. To
tackle these limitations, we propose a model for directly processing
consecutive RGB frames, and infer the optical flow between any pair of frames
using a layered representation, with the opacity channels being treated as the
segmentation. Additionally, to enforce object permanence, we apply temporal
consistency loss on the inferred masks from randomly-paired frames, which refer
to the motions at different paces, and encourage the model to segment the
objects even if they may not move at the current time point. Experimentally, we
demonstrate superior performance over previous state-of-the-art methods on

industry, hard-distinguishing semantic boundaries have posed a significant
threat to existing solutions. Inspired by real-life experience, i.e., combining
varied observations contributes to higher visual recognition confidence, we
present the equipotential learning (EPL) method. This novel module transfers
the predicted/ground-truth semantic labels to a self-defined potential domain
to learn and infer decision boundaries along customized directions. The
conversion to the potential domain is implemented via a lightweight
differentiable anisotropic convolution without incurring any parameter
overhead. Besides, the designed two loss functions, the point loss and the
equipotential line loss implement anisotropic field regression and
category-level contour learning, respectively, enhancing prediction
consistencies in the inter/intra-class boundary areas. More importantly, EPL is
agnostic to network architectures, and thus it can be plugged into most
existing segmentation models. This paper is the first attempt to address the
boundary segmentation problem with field regression and contour learning.
Meaningful performance improvements on Pascal Voc 2012 and Cityscapes
demonstrate that the proposed EPL module can benefit the off-the-shelf fully
convolutional network models when recognizing semantic boundary areas. Besides,
intensive comparisons and analysis show the favorable merits of EPL for
distinguishing semantically-similar and irregular-shaped categories.

clients without the sharing of data for privacy considerations. However, one
major challenge for this learning paradigm is the {\em data heterogeneity}
problem, which refers to the discrepancies between the local data distributions
among various clients. To tackle this problem, we first study how data
heterogeneity affects the representations of the globally aggregated models.
Interestingly, we find that heterogeneous data results in the global model
suffering from severe {\em dimensional collapse}, in which representations tend
to reside in a lower-dimensional space instead of the ambient space. Moreover,
we observe a similar phenomenon on models locally trained on each client and
deduce that the dimensional collapse on the global model is inherited from
local models. In addition, we theoretically analyze the gradient flow dynamics
to shed light on how data heterogeneity result in dimensional collapse for
local models. To remedy this problem caused by the data heterogeneity, we
propose {\sc FedDecorr}, a novel method that can effectively mitigate
dimensional collapse in federated learning. Specifically, {\sc FedDecorr}
applies a regularization term during local training that encourages different
dimensions of representations to be uncorrelated. {\sc FedDecorr}, which is
implementation-friendly and computationally-efficient, yields consistent
improvements over baselines on standard benchmark datasets. Code:

old class distributions and estimating new class distributions given few
training samples. In this study, we propose a learnable distribution
calibration (LDC) approach, with the aim to systematically solve these two
challenges using a unified framework. LDC is built upon a parameterized
calibration unit (PCU), which initializes biased distributions for all classes
based on classifier vectors (memory-free) and a single covariance matrix. The
covariance matrix is shared by all classes, so that the memory costs are fixed.
During base training, PCU is endowed with the ability to calibrate biased
distributions by recurrently updating sampled features under the supervision of
real distributions. During incremental learning, PCU recovers distributions for
old classes to avoid `forgetting', as well as estimating distributions and
augmenting samples for new classes to alleviate `over-fitting' caused by the
biased distributions of few-shot samples. LDC is theoretically plausible by
formatting a variational inference procedure. It improves FSCIL's flexibility
as the training procedure requires no class similarity priori. Experiments on
CUB200, CIFAR100, and mini-ImageNet datasets show that LDC outperforms the
state-of-the-arts by 4.64%, 1.98%, and 3.97%, respectively. LDC's effectiveness

more and more software systems. This estate expansion leads not only to greater
complexity and expense for the enterprise, but also to fragmentation,
inconsistency and siloing of business processes. Because platform
rationalisation and system decommissioning never happens spontaneously, a
perennial problem for the enterprise then becomes how to simplify their
corporate software platforms. Recently, Curlew Research personnel were involved
in a software rationalisation program within a large global life sciences
company and this paper describes an approach to decommissioning which we
developed as part of that project, and which we feel could be of use more
widely to help with objective more user-centric system rationalisation. The
method derives from a model developed by Noriaki Kano et al to help with
determining customer satisfaction and loyalty, and the prioritisation of new,
additional functionality, features or ""products"", for example when looking to
enhance software applications. Using a blueprint process for rationalisation,
the Curlew-Kano method enables each application to be placed efficiently and
objectively into one of four categories - Retain; Review; Remove; Research -
thus allowing the enterprise to identify and prioritise quickly those systems
which warrant further investigation as part of a decommissioning activity. The
key difference of the Curlew-Kano method compared to other application
rationalisation methodologies is the fundamental involvement of users in the
identification of systems more suitable for rationalisation and possible
decommissioning. In our view involving users more fully in system
rationalisation leads to better outcomes for the enterprise.

nonlocal. Remarkably, different nonlocal quantum correlations can be

by mixed graphs. In particular, the set of covariance matrices for

each vertex and edge in $G$. This rational parametrization naturally allows for
the study of these models from an algebraic and combinatorial point of view.
Indeed, this point of view has led to a collection of results in the
literature, mainly focusing on questions related to identifiability and
determining relationships between covariances (i.e., finding polynomials in the
Gaussian vanishing ideal). So far, a large proportion of these results has
focused on the case when $D$, the directed part of the mixed graph $G$, is
acyclic. This is due to the fact that in the acyclic case, the parametrization
becomes polynomial and there is a description of the entries of the covariance
matrices in terms of a finite sum. We move beyond the acyclic case and give a
closed form expression for the entries of the covariance matrices in terms of
the one-connections in a graph obtained from $D$ through some small operations.
This closed form expression then allows us to show that if $G$ is simple, then
the parametrization map is generically finite-to-one. Finally, having a closed
form expression for the covariance matrices allows for the development of an
algorithm for systematically exploring possible polynomials in the Gaussian
vanishing ideal.

Rahimi and Recht (NIPS'07), is a powerful technique to find approximate
low-dimensional representations of points in (high-dimensional) kernel space,
for shift-invariant kernels. While RFF has been analyzed under various notions
of error guarantee, the ability to preserve the kernel distance with
\emph{relative} error is less understood. We show that for a significant range
of kernels, including the well-known Laplacian kernels, RFF cannot approximate
the kernel distance with small relative error using low dimensions. We
complement this by showing as long as the shift-invariant kernel is analytic,
RFF with $\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1} \log n)$ dimensions achieves
$\epsilon$-relative error for pairwise kernel distance of $n$ points, and the
dimension bound is improved to $\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}\log k)$ for the
specific application of kernel $k$-means. Finally, going beyond RFF, we make
the first step towards data-oblivious dimension-reduction for general
shift-invariant kernels, and we obtain a similar $\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}
\log n)$ dimension bound for Laplacian kernels. We also validate the
dimension-error tradeoff of our methods on simulated datasets, and they

natural language processing, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been
developed to learn discriminative node representations on graph datasets.
However, the development of GCL on Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) is
still in the infant stage. For example, it is unclear how to augment the HINs
without substantially altering the underlying semantics, and how to design the
contrastive objective to fully capture the rich semantics. Moreover, early
investigations demonstrate that CL suffers from sampling bias, whereas
conventional debiasing techniques are empirically shown to be inadequate for
GCL. How to mitigate the sampling bias for heterogeneous GCL is another
important problem. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel
Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Multi-view Learning (HGCML) model. In
particular, we use metapaths as the augmentation to generate multiple subgraphs
as multi-views, and propose a contrastive objective to maximize the mutual
information between any pairs of metapath-induced views. To alleviate the
sampling bias, we further propose a positive sampling strategy to explicitly
select positives for each node via jointly considering semantic and structural
information preserved on each metapath view. Extensive experiments demonstrate
HGCML consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on five real-world

  Classification with Incomplete Data",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate medical classification requires a large number of multi-modal data,
and in many cases, in different formats. Previous studies have shown promising
results when using multi-modal data, outperforming single-modality models on
when classifying disease such as AD. However, those models are usually not
flexible enough to handle missing modalities. Currently, the most common
workaround is excluding samples with missing modalities which leads to
considerable data under-utilisation. Adding to the fact that labelled medical
images are already scarce, the performance of data-driven methods like deep
learning is severely hampered. Therefore, a multi-modal method that can
gracefully handle missing data in various clinical settings is highly
desirable. In this paper, we present the Multi-Modal Mixing Transformer (3MT),
a novel Transformer for disease classification based on multi-modal data. In
this work, we test it for \ac{AD} or \ac{CN} classification using neuroimaging
data, gender, age and MMSE scores. The model uses a novel Cascaded Modality
Transformers architecture with cross-attention to incorporate multi-modal
information for more informed predictions. Auxiliary outputs and a novel
modality dropout mechanism were incorporated to ensure an unprecedented level
of modality independence and robustness. The result is a versatile network that
enables the mixing of an unlimited number of modalities with different formats
and full data utilization. 3MT was first tested on the ADNI dataset and
achieved state-of-the-art test accuracy of $0.987\pm0.0006$. To test its
generalisability, 3MT was directly applied to the AIBL after training on the
ADNI dataset, and achieved a test accuracy of $0.925\pm0.0004$ without
fine-tuning. Finally, we show that Grad-CAM visualizations are also possible

network-enabled robots have become important to support future machine-assisted
and unmanned applications. To provide high-quality services for robots in wide
areas, hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks are a key technology. Through
hybrid networks, computation-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks can be
offloaded to mobile edge computing (MEC) servers. However, due to the mobility
of mobile robots and unreliable wireless network environments, excessive local
computations and frequent service migrations may significantly increase the
service delay. To address this issue, this paper aims to minimize the average
task completion time for MEC-based offloading initiated by
satellite-terrestrial-network-enabled robots. Different from conventional
mobility-aware schemes, the proposed scheme makes the offloading decision by
jointly considering the mobility control of robots. A joint optimization
problem of task offloading and velocity control is formulated. Using Lyapunov
optimization, the original optimization is decomposed into a velocity control
subproblem and a task offloading subproblem. Then, based on the Markov decision
process (MDP), a dual-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed.
The convergence and complexity of the improved RL algorithm are theoretically
analyzed, and the simulation results show that the proposed scheme can
effectively reduce the offloading delay.

critical to electricity grid stability and power dispatching capabilities.
However, Photovoltaic (PV) power generation is highly volatile and unstable due
to different reasons. The Wavelet Transform (WT) has been utilised in time
series applications, such as Photovoltaic (PV) power prediction, to model the
stochastic volatility and reduce prediction errors. Yet the existing Wavelet
Transform (WT) approach has a limitation in terms of time complexity. It
requires reconstructing the decomposed components and modelling them separately
and thus needs more time for reconstruction, model configuration and training.
The aim of this study is to improve the efficiency of applying Wavelet
Transform (WT) by proposing a new method that uses a single simplified model.
Given a time series and its Wavelet Transform (WT) coefficients, it trains one
model with the coefficients as features and the original time series as labels.
This eliminates the need for component reconstruction and training numerous
models. This work contributes to the day-ahead aggregated solar Photovoltaic
(PV) power time series prediction problem by proposing and comprehensively
evaluating a new approach of employing WT. The proposed approach is evaluated
using 17 months of aggregated solar Photovoltaic (PV) power data from two
real-world datasets. The evaluation includes the use of a variety of prediction
models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression,
and Convolutional Neural Networks. The results indicate that using a
coefficients-based strategy can give predictions that are comparable to those
obtained using the components-based approach while requiring fewer models and
less computational time.

The discovery and understanding of first integrals are fundamental and

First integrals arise from the conservation laws of system energy, momentum,

specific geometric structures of the governing equations. Existing neural
networks designed to ensure such first integrals have shown excellent accuracy
in modeling from data. However, these models incorporate the underlying

these structures are also unknown. This limitation needs to be overcome for

closed system of first-order differential equations evolves the pairs of polar
and azimuthal angles of the spin and orbital angular momentum vectors together
with the periastron angle. The secular dynamics is autonomous. We confirm
numerically, that secular evolutions look like smoothed-out instantaneous
evolutions over timescales where radiation reaction is negligible. The secular
evolution of the spin polar angles and the difference of their azimuthal angles
generates a closed subsystem. We study analytically this system for the
particular cases of one spin dominating over the other and for black hole -
boson star binaries of equal masses. In the first case known large flip-flops
of the smaller spin are reproduced, when the larger spin is almost coplanar
with the orbit. We also find new, quadrupole-induced flip-flops occurring when
the neutron star with dominant spin has a quadrupolar parameter $w_1\approx 3$.
Finally we analyze the evolutions of the spin angles numerically by comparing
the cases when the black hole companion is either a gravastar, another black
hole or a boson star with identical mass. We find that both the amplitude and
period of the flip-flop are the largest, when the companion is a black hole. In
the case of a boson star companion the frequency of the flip-flop increases
significantly. Further, while in the case of gravastars and black holes a
swinging-type azimuthal evolution occurs, with the spins of the components

with both spins antialigned to the orbital angular momentum, for both spins
aligned to the orbital angular momentum (with the exception of certain
quadrupolar parameter ranges of neutron stars and boson stars), and for the
extremal mass ratio. For equal masses, the configurations of one of the spins
aligned and the other antialigned is stable for gravastar binaries, for neutron

nonorthogonal double foliation for the study of spherically symmetric, static
black hole solutions of Horndeski scalar-tensor theory. Our discussion proceeds
in an effective field theory (EFT) of modified gravity approach, with the
action depending on metric and embedding scalars adapted to the nonorthogonal
2+1+1 decomposition. We prove that the most generic class of Horndeski
Lagrangians compatible with observations can be expressed in this EFT form. By
studying the first order perturbation of the EFT action we derive three
equations of motion, which reduce to those derived earlier in an orthogonal
2+1+1 decomposition, and a fourth equation for the metric parameter N related
to the nonorthogonality of the foliation. For the Horndeski class of theories
with vanishing $G_3$ and $G_5$, but generic functions $G_2(\phi,X)$ (k-essence)
and $G_4(\phi)$ (nonminimal coupling to the metric) we prove the unicity
theorem that no action beyond Einstein--Hilbert allows for the Schwarzschild
solution. Next we integrate the EFT field equations for the case with only one
independent metric function obtaining new solutions characterized by a
parameter interpreted as either mass or tidal charge, the cosmological constant
and a third parameter. These solutions represent naked singularities, black
holes with scalar hair or have the double horizon structure of the
Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetime. Solutions with homogeneous Kantowski--Sachs
type regions also emerge. Finally, one of the solutions obtained for the
function $G_4$ linear in the curvature coordinate, in certain parameter range
exhibits an intriguing logarithmic singularity lying outside the horizon. The
newly derived hairy black hole solutions evade previously known unicity
theorems by being asymptotically nonflat, even in the absence of the
cosmological constant.

can withstand all scenarios in an uncertainty set. However, with the
proliferation of distributed energy resources, there are rising uncertainties
from distributed agents of which the operator has little data. This makes it
difficult to build an appropriate uncertainty set, leading to inaccurate, or
even infeasible, scheduling strategies. This paper proposes a novel two-stage
robust scheduling model that allows the operator to purchase predictive
information from distributed agents to make better scheduling decisions. An
improved uncertainty set with a smaller variation range is used, which is
developed by combining the forecasts from the operator and distributed agents.
The proposed model is a case of robust optimization with decision-dependent
uncertainty (DDU) since the improved uncertainty set is influenced by the
first-stage information purchase related decisions. An adaptive
column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm is developed to solve the
problem within a finite number of iterations. The potential failures of
traditional algorithms in detecting feasibility, guaranteeing convergence, and
reaching optimal strategies under DDU are successfully circumvented by the
proposed algorithm. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness, necessity, and
scalability of the proposed method.

results show that when a gap perturbation is introduced into the system
resulting in the Brillouin zone folding, BIC transforms into quasi-BIC whose
quality factor (Q-factor) is related to the value of gap perturbation. The
strong coupling results in the anti-crossover behavior of the absorption
spectra, and thus a Rabi splitting energy of 0.235 eV is obtained. Temporal
coupled-mode theory is employed to analyze the strong coupling system, and the
absorption of the system could be enhanced, by modulating the damping rate of
quasi-BIC to make the system satisfy the strong critical coupling condition.
Furthermore, polaritonic coherent perfect absorption is achieved by using the
two-port source excitation. This work could provide ideas for enhancing

different neural network components, such as dropout, normalization, number of

improve the neural network robustness to weight drifting. Based on our
analysis, we propose an efficient search space by only searching for dropout

proposing a novel deep generative framework that recovers semantics and the
correlation of properties through disentangled latent vectors. The correlation
is handled via an explainable mask pooling layer, and properties are precisely

""under-diagnosis"", in which patients are misclassified into less severe
categories and thus receive insufficient medical care. The Neyman-Pearson (NP)
classification paradigm has been developed to prioritize the designated type of
error. However, current NP procedures are either for binary classification or
do not provide high probability controls on the prioritized errors in
multi-class classification. Here, we propose a hierarchical NP (H-NP) framework
and an umbrella algorithm that generally adapts to popular classification
methods and controls the under-diagnosis errors with high probability. On an

to guide users through the vast amount of available products. Consequently, the
field of recommender systems has attracted increased attention from the

faces several challenges. For instance, most existing work models the
recommendation problem as a matrix completion problem to predict the user
preference for an item. This abstraction prevents the system from utilizing the
rich information from the ordered sequence of user actions logged in online
sessions. To address this limitation, researchers have recently developed a
promising new breed of algorithms called sequence-aware recommender systems to
predict the user's next action by utilizing the time series composed of the
sequence of actions in an ongoing user session. This paper proposes a novel
sequence-aware recommendation approach based on a complex network generated by
the hidden metric space model, which combines node similarity and popularity to
generate links. We build a network model from data and then use it to predict
the user's subsequent actions. The network model provides an additional source
of information that improves the accuracy of the recommendations. The proposed

  community building perspective","10 pages, comments welcome!",,,,"cs.CY cs.HC cs.LG hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A foundational set of findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable
(FAIR) principles were proposed in 2016 as prerequisites for proper data
management and stewardship, with the goal of enabling the reusability of
scholarly data. The principles were also meant to apply to other digital
assets, at a high level, and over time, the FAIR guiding principles have been
re-interpreted or extended to include the software, tools, algorithms, and
workflows that produce data. FAIR principles are now being adapted in the
context of AI models and datasets. Here, we present the perspectives, vision,
and experiences of researchers from different countries, disciplines, and
backgrounds who are leading the definition and adoption of FAIR principles in
their communities of practice, and discuss outcomes that may result from
pursuing and incentivizing FAIR AI research. The material for this report
builds on the FAIR for AI Workshop held at Argonne National Laboratory on June
7, 2022.

  uncertainty","Submitted to the IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference",,,,"cs.CY cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Well-executed emergency evacuations can save lives and reduce suffering.
However, decision makers struggle to determine optimal evacuation policies
given the chaos, uncertainty, and value judgments inherent in emergency
evacuations. We propose and analyze a decision support tool for pre-crisis
training exercises for teams preparing for civilian evacuations and explore the
tool in the case of the 2021 U.S.-led evacuation from Afghanistan. We use
different classes of Markov decision processes (MDPs) to capture compounding
levels of uncertainty in (1) the priority category of who appears next at the
gate for evacuation, (2) the distribution of priority categories at the
population level, and (3) individuals' claimed priority category. We compare
the number of people evacuated by priority status under eight heuristic
policies. The optimized MDP policy achieves the best performance compared to
all heuristic baselines. We also show that accounting for the compounding
levels of model uncertainty incurs added complexity without improvement in
policy performance. Useful heuristics can be extracted from the optimized
policies to inform human decision makers. We open-source all tools to encourage
robust dialogue about the trade-offs, limitations, and potential of integrating
algorithms into high-stakes humanitarian decision-making.

researchers as a strategy to access technology for cutting-edge research.
Specifically, it is discussed what kind of open technologies are most enabling
in scientific environments characterized by economic and infrastructural
constraints. It is demonstrated that do-it-yourself (DIY) technologies are
already wide spread, in particular in countries with lower science funding,
which in turn is the basis for the development of open technologies. Beyond
financial accessibility, open hardware can be transformational to the
technology access of laboratories through advantages in local production and
direct knowledge transfer. Central drivers of the adoption of appropriate
technologies in biolabs globally are open sharing, digital fabrication, local
production, standard parts use, and detailed documentation.

magnetically actuated objects, such as in microrheology and microrobotics
research. Therefore, optimizing the design of such systems is highly desired.
Some of the features that are lacking in most current designs are compactness,
portability, and versatility. Portability is especially relevant for biomedical
applications in which in vivo or in vitro testing may be conducted in locations
away from the laboratory microscope. This document describes the design,
fabrication and implementation of a compact, low cost, versatile, and user
friendly device (the ModMag) capable of controlling multiple electromagnetic
setups, including a two-dimensional 4-coil traditional configuration, a
3-dimensional Helmholtz configuration, and a 3-dimensional magnetic tweezer
configuration. All electronics and circuitry for powering the systems is
contained in a compact 10""x6""x3"" system which includes a 10"" touchscreen. A
graphical user interface provides additional ease of use. The system can also
be controlled remotely, allowing for more flexibility and the ability to
interface with other software running on the remote computer such as propriety
camera software. Aside from the software and circuitry, we also describe the
design of the electromagnetic coil setups and provide examples of the use of
the ModMag in experiments.

  Continuous Exposure","14 pages, 3 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Regression calibration has been used to correct for the bias in causal effect
due to measurement error in continuous exposures, but no systematic discussion
exists on how to adjust for covariates in measurement error model (MEM) and
outcome model used by the regression calibration method. In this paper, we
investigate the methods for the selection of the minimal and most efficient
covariate adjustment sets for regression calibration method developed by
Rosner, Spiegelman and Willet (RSW, 1990) under a causal inference framework.
We utilize directed acyclic graph to illustrate how subject matter knowledge
can aid the selection of such adjustment sets. We show that in order to
unbiasedly correct for measurement error, researchers need to collect data on
any common causes (1)of true exposure and outcome and (2)of measurement error
and outcome, in both main and validation study sample. Researchers need to
adjust for this minimal covariate set in both MEM and outcome model. When such
variable(s) are only available in the main study, researchers should still
adjust for them in the outcome model to reduce bias, provided that these
covariates are weakly associated with measurement error. We also show that
adjusting for outcome risk factors that are independent of true exposure and
measurement error in outcome model only may increase efficiency, while
adjusting for any non-risk factors that are associated with true exposure
almost always result in efficiency loss in realistic settings. Finally, we
extend the originally proposed estimators to a non-parametric setting where
effect modification by covariates is allowed.
