Computing for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The goals of the
experiment include 1) studying neutrino oscillations using a beam of neutrinos
sent from Fermilab in Illinois to the Sanford Underground Research Facility
(SURF) in Lead, South Dakota, 2) studying astrophysical neutrino sources and
rare processes and 3) understanding the physics of neutrino interactions in
matter. We describe the development of the computing infrastructure needed to
achieve the physics goals of the experiment by storing, cataloging,
reconstructing, simulating, and analyzing $\sim$ 30 PB of data/year from DUNE
and its prototypes. Rather than prescribing particular algorithms, our goal is
to provide resources that are flexible and accessible enough to support
creative software solutions and advanced algorithms as HEP computing evolves.
We describe the physics objectives, organization, use cases, and proposed
technical solutions.

rise with the first repetitions and attains a peak after which interest will
decrease with subsequent exposures, resulting in an inverted-U shape. This
behavior, which has been extensively studied in psychology, is called the mere
exposure effect. In this paper, we show how a number of factors, both content

modulate the magnitude of the effect. Due to the vast availability of data of
users discovering new songs everyday in music streaming platforms, these
findings enable new ways to characterize both the music, users and their
relationships. Ultimately, it opens up the possibility of developing new
recommender systems paradigms based on these characterizations.

parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is important to understand, both from a
fundamental perspective, and from a practical standpoint for controlled
generation of entangled states. In this context, it is known that in the
absence of postselection, the pump coherence in a given degree of freedom (DOF)
imposes an upper limit on the generated entanglement in the same DOF. However,
the cross-influence of the pump coherence on the generated entanglement in a
different DOF is not well-understood. Here, we experimentally investigate the
effect of a spatiotemporally highly-incoherent (STHI) light-emitting diode
(LED) pump on the polarization entanglement generated in SPDC. Our quantum
state tomography measurements using multimode collection fibers to reduce the
influence of postselection yield a two-qubit state with a concurrence of
0.531+/-0.006 and a purity of 0.647+/-0.005, in excellent agreement with our
theoretically predicted concurrence of 0.552 and purity of 0.652. Therefore,
while the use of an STHI pump causes reduction in the entanglement and purity
of the output polarization two-qubit state, the viability of SPDC with STHI
pumps is nevertheless important for two reasons: (i) STHI sources are
ubiquitous and available at a wider range of wavelengths than lasers, and (ii)
the generated STHI polarization-entangled two-photon states could potentially
be useful in long-distance quantum communication schemes due to their

described by a pair of gauge fields defined over a flat Minkowski background
spacetime. The matter content is completely described by the Dirac spinor
field, and the quantum effects of matter are identified as the spin tensor
derived from the spinor field. The existence of the spin of matter results in
the torsion field defined over spacetime. Torsion field plays the role of
Bohmian quantum potential which turns out to be a kind of repulsive force as
opposed to the gravitational potential which is attractive. The equivalence
principle remains and essential in this theory so that GR is relegated to a
locally approximate theory wherein the quantum effects (torsion) are
negligible. As a toy model, we assume that the macro matter content can be
described by the covariant Dirac equation and apply this theory to the simplest

irradiated by two light pulses with an adjustable time delay between them. The
relevant response coefficient exhibits a universal form that originates from
the statistical phase acquired when anyons created by the first pulse braid
around those created by the second. This behaviour is shown to be qualitatively
unchanged by non-universal physics including non-statistical interactions and
small finite temperatures. In magnetic systems, the signal of interest can be
measured using currently available terahertz-domain probes, highlighting the
potential usefulness of nonlinear spectroscopic techniques in the search for
quantum spin liquids.

  quark model with scalar nonet exchange",,,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, Belle\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} Collaboration firstly
reported a new resonance $\omega\chi_{bJ}$ in the processes of $e^{+}e^{-}
\rightarrow \omega\chi_{bJ}$ at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}=10.745$ GeV.
Given the Born cross section similar with the previously reported
$\Upsilon(10753)$, the new resonance $\omega\chi_{bJ}$ may have be
$\Upsilon(10753)$. From the perspectives of traditional $\Upsilon(nS)$ meson
and exotic tetraquark $b\bar{q}q\bar{b}$ state with the $J^{PC}$ = $1^{--}$, we
tentatively investigate the $\Upsilon(10753)$ by solving Schr\""odinger equation
in the framework of the chiral quark model. Numerical results for the meson
show that the mass of $\Upsilon(5S)$ is up to 10.86 GeV and unsuitable for the
candidate of $\Upsilon(10753)$. On the other hand, not only the two kinds of
molecular structure ($b\bar{b}$-$q\bar{q}$, $b\bar{q}$-$q\bar{b}$) but also the
\da~structure ($\bar{b}\bar{q}$-$qb$) are considered into our tetraquark
calculation with the help of Gaussian expansion method. When a fully-channel
coupling is performed using the real-scaling method (stabilization method), we
get a stable resonance $^1R_{1}(10770)$ ( $^{2S+1}R_J$ ) with a great component
of the diquark-antidiquark state. Combined with the mass and width of
$^1R_{1}(10770)$, it may be a good candidate for experimental
$\Upsilon(10753)$. Besides, several resonance states ranging from 10.82 GeV to
10.96 GeV are obtained, which are expected to be further verified in future
experiments.

gravitational wave signals, and they are predictions of general relativity in
the nonlinear regime that have close connections to the asymptotic properties
of isolated gravitating systems. There are many types of memory effects that
have been studied in the literature. In this paper we focus on the
""displacement"" and ""spin"" memories, which are expected to be the largest of
these effects from sources such as the binary black hole mergers which have
already been detected by LIGO and Virgo. The displacement memory is a change in
the relative separation of two initially comoving observers due to a burst of
gravitational waves, whereas the spin memory is a portion of the change in
relative separation of observers with initial relative velocity. As both of
these effects are small, LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA can only detect memory effects
from individual events that are much louder (and thus rarer) than those that
have been detected so far. By combining data from multiple events, however,
these effects could be detected in a population of binary mergers. In this
paper, we present new forecasts for how long current and future detectors will
need to operate in order to measure these effects from populations of binary
black hole systems that are consistent with the populations inferred from the
detections from LIGO and Virgo's first three observing runs. We find that a
second-generation detector network of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA operating at the
O4 (""design"") sensitivity for 1.5 years and then operating at the O5 (""plus"")

Cosmic Explorer, we find that displacement memory could be detected for
individual loud events, and that the spin memory could be detected in a
population after 5 years of observation time.

impossible, and such test suites typically contain many redundant test cases.
Hence, test case minimization is used to remove redundant test cases that are
unlikely to detect new faults. However, most test case (suite) minimization
techniques rely on code coverage (white-box), model-based features, or
requirements specifications, which are not always accessible by test engineers.
Recently, a set of novel techniques was proposed, called FAST-R, relying solely
on test case code for test case minimization, which appeared to be much more
efficient than white-box techniques. However, it achieved a comparable low
fault detection capability for Java projects, making its application
challenging in practice. This paper proposes ATM (AST-based Test case
Minimizer), a similarity-based, search-based test case minimization technique,
taking a specific budget as input, that also relies exclusively on the source
code of test cases but attempts to achieve higher fault detection through
finer-grained similarity analysis and a dedicated search algorithm. ATM
transforms test case code into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and relies on four
tree-based similarity measures to apply evolutionary search, specifically
genetic algorithms, to minimize test cases. We evaluated the effectiveness and
efficiency of ATM on a large dataset of 16 Java projects with 661 faulty
versions using three budgets ranging from 25% to 75% of test suites. ATM
achieved significantly higher fault detection rates (0.82 on average), compared
to FAST-R (0.61 on average) and random minimization (0.52 on average), when
running only 50% of the test cases, within practically acceptable time (1.1-4.3
hours, on average), given that minimization is only occasionally applied when
many new test cases are created (major releases). Results achieved for other
budgets were consistent.

ST-GNNs are particularly useful in multi-agent systems, due to their stability
properties and their ability to respect communication delays between the
agents. In this paper we revisit the stability properties of ST-GNNs and prove
that they are stable to stochastic graph perturbations. Our analysis suggests
that ST-GNNs are suitable for transfer learning on time-varying graphs and
enables the design of generalized convolutional architectures that jointly
process time-varying graphs and time-varying signals. Numerical experiments on
decentralized control systems validate our theoretical results and showcase the
benefits of traditional and generalized ST-GNN architectures.

reionization over high mass haloes. Furthermore, the variation across

First, we use the relative binning algorithm to evaluate the
signal-to-noise-ratio timeseries in each detector for a given choice of
intrinsic parameters. Second, we decouple the estimation of the intrinsic
parameters (such as masses and spins of the components) from that of the
extrinsic parameters (such as distance, orientation, and sky location) that
describe a binary compact object coalescence. We achieve this by
semi-analytically marginalizing the posterior distribution over extrinsic
parameters without repeatedly evaluating the waveform for a fixed set of
intrinsic parameters. Finally, we augment samples of intrinsic parameters with
extrinsic parameters drawn from their appropriate conditional distributions. We
implement the method for binaries with aligned spins, restricted to the
quadrupole mode of the signal. Using simulated GW signals, we demonstrate that
the method produces full eleven-dimensional posteriors that match those from
standard Bayesian inference. Our framework takes only ~200 seconds to analyze a
typical binary-black-hole signal and ~250 seconds to analyze a typical
binary-neutron-star signal using one computing core. Such real-time and
accurate estimation of the binary source properties will greatly aid the
interpretation of triggers from gravitational wave searches, as well as the
search for possible electromagnetic counterparts. We make the framework

of time-reversal broken superconductivity from a non-magnetic normal state.
Breaking time-reversal symmetry in a single second-order superconducting
transition requires the existence of two degenerate superconducting order
parameters, which is not natural for orthorhombic UTe$_2$. Moreover,
experiments under pressure suggest that this superconductivity sets in at a
single transition temperature in a finite parameter window, in contrast to
splitting between the symmetry breaking temperatures expected for accidental
degenerate orders. Here we demonstrate that the thermodynamic phase diagram of
a triplet superconductor near a magnetic quantum phase transition can contain
an extended region, where time-reversal breaking superconductivity onsets in a
single, weakly first order transition. It arises due to coupling between
incipient magnetic order and magnetic moments of triplet pairs, which favors a
time-reversal broken superconducting state. A microscopic origin of this
coupling is identified as screening of magnetic moments by chiral Cooper pairs,
built out of two non-degenerate pairs - an extension of Kondo screening to
unconventional pairs. We discuss the experimental signatures of such a weakly
first order transition and the resulting phase diagram. Also, we demonstrate
the possibility of a finite-momentum pairing due to coupling of
superconductivity and antiferromagnetism, and discuss possible relations to the
pair- and charge- density waves, recently observed in UTe$_2$.

the ""spider"" companion mass distribution remains strongly bimodal, with
essentially zero systems having companion masses between
$\sim0.07-0.1\,M_{\odot}$. X-ray emission from black widows is typically softer
and less luminous than in redbacks, consistent with less efficient particle
acceleration in the intrabinary shock in black widows, excepting a few systems
that appear to have more efficient ""redback-like"" shocks. Together black widows
and redbacks dominate the census of the fastest-spinning field millisecond
pulsars in binaries with known companion types, making up $\gtrsim$80% of

mass gap by non-perturbative interactions without generating any fermion
bilinear condensation. The previous studies of symmetric mass generation have
been limited to Dirac/Weyl/Majorana fermions with zero Fermi volume in the free
fermion limit. In this work, we generalize the concept of symmetric mass
generation to Fermi liquid with a finite Fermi volume and discuss how to gap
out the Fermi surfaces by interactions without breaking the U(1) loop group
symmetry or developing topological orders. We provide examples of Fermi surface
symmetric mass generation in both (1+1)D and (2+1)D Fermi liquid systems when
several Fermi surfaces together cancel the Fermi surface anomaly. However, the
U(1) loop group symmetry in these cases is still restrictive enough to rule out
all possible fermion bilinear gapping terms, such that a non-perturbative
interaction mechanism is the only way to gap out the Fermi surfaces. This
symmetric Fermi surface reconstruction is in contrast to the conventional
symmetry-breaking mechanism to gap the Fermi surfaces. As a side product, our
model provides a pristine 1D lattice regularization for the (1+1)D U(1)
symmetric chiral fermion model (e.g., the 3-4-5-0 model) by utilizing a lattice
translation symmetry as an emergent U(1) symmetry at low energy. This opens up
the opportunity for efficient numerical simulations of chiral fermions in their
own dimensions without introducing mirror fermions under the domain wall
fermion construction.

computed from first principles only for weak transitions with strength
parameters $\alpha \lesssim 0.05$, and the Chapman-Jouguet velocity defines the
maximum velocity for which the wall is stopped by the friction from the plasma.
We further provide an analytical approximation to the wall velocity in the
general scalar singlet scenario without $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and test it
against the results of a detailed calculation, finding good agreement. We show
that in the singlet scenario with a spontaneously broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry, the phase transition is always weak and we see no hope for
baryogenesis. In contrast, in the case with explicit $\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking
there is a region of the parameter space producing a promising baryon yield in
the presence of CP violating interactions via an effective operator involving
the singlet scalar and the SM top quarks. Yet, we find that this region yields
unobservable gravitational waves. Finally, we show that the promising region

find that this population of black holes has large orbital inclinations

eccentricity of their orbits is also significant ($0.6\pm0.2$) and decreases
with time. Wandering IMBHs undergo spikes of accretion activity around the

rate and a median accretion duty cycle of $\sim 12\%$. Their typical spectral
energy distribution peaks in the infrared at $\sim 11 \, \mu \rm m$ rest-frame.
Assuming a standard value of $10\%$ for the matter-to-energy radiative
efficiency, IMBHs reach $2-10$ keV X-ray luminosities $>10^{37} \,

has recently been shown that breaking of the standard assumptions can lead to
parity violation within the Effective Field Theory of Inflation (EFTI). In
particular, we consider the Ghost Condensate and Cosmological Collider
scenarios -- the former for the leading and subleading operators in the EFTI
and the latter for different values of mass and speed of an exchanged spin-$1$
particle -- for a total of $18$ models. Each instance yields a definite
prediction for the inflationary trispectrum, which we convert to a late-time
galaxy correlator prediction (through a highly non-trivial calculation) and
constrain using the observed data. We find no evidence for inflationary
parity-violation (with each of the $18$ models having significances below
$2\sigma$), and place the first constraints on the relevant coupling strengths,
at a level comparable with the theoretical perturbativity bounds. This is also
the first time Cosmological Collider signatures have directly been searched for
in observational data. We further show that possible secondary parity-violating
signatures in galaxy clustering can be systematically described within the
Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure. We argue that these late-time
contributions are subdominant compared to the primordial parity-odd signal for
a vast region of parameter space. In summary, the results of this paper
disfavor the notion that the recent hints of parity-violation observed in the
distribution of galaxies are due to new physics.

(92 degrees) relative to the wide orbit, and that of B is inclined about 59
degrees compared to AB. We determine the dynamical masses of the four stars in
Castor A and B to a precision better than 1%. We also determine the radii of
the primary stars of both subsystems from their angular diameters measured with
CHARA, and use them together with stellar evolution models to infer an age for
the system of 290 Myr. The new knowledge of the orbits enables us to measure
the slow motion of Castor C as well, which may assist future studies of the
dynamical evolution of this remarkable sextuple system.

types of decoherence, which can drive a pure SPT state into a mixed state. We
demonstrate that the system can still retain the nontrivial topological
information from the SPT ground state even under decoherence. The main quantity
that we investigate is the ``strange correlator"" proposed previously as a
diagnosis for the SPT ground states, and in this work, we generalize the notion
of the strange correlator to mixed-state density matrices. Using both exact
calculations of the stabilizer Hamiltonians and field theory evaluations, we
demonstrate that under decoherence the nontrivial features of the SPT state can
persist in the two types of strange correlators: type-I and type-II. We show
that the nontrivial type-I strange correlator corresponds to the presence of
the SPT information that can be efficiently identified from experiments. The
nontrivial type-II strange correlator corresponds to the presence of the
original SPT information in the density matrix, which in principle can be
identified to distinguish decohered mixed states of an SPT and trivial states.
Therefore, our work provides a unified framework to understand decohered SPT
phases from the information-theoretic viewpoint.

scattering. In particular, the model includes a significant probability for
particles to up-scatter from the ground state to the excited state. We simulate
a suite of zoom-in Milky Way-sized N-body haloes with six models with different

We find that the up-scattering reaction greatly increases the central densities
of the main halo through the loss of kinetic energy. However, the physical
model still results in significant coring due to the presence of elastic
scattering and down-scattering. These effects are not as apparent in the
subhalo population compared to the main halo, but the number of subhaloes is

overdensity located behind the Milky Way, in the tile b204 of the VVV survey.
Methods. We studied an area of six arcmin around a galaxy concentration located
at l = 354.82{\deg} and b = -9.81{\deg}. We selected five galaxies taking into
account the source distribution on the sky, in order to optimise the requested
time for the observations, and we obtained the spectra with Flamingos 2

characterise the absorption features we have fitted the galaxies underlying
spectrum using the starlight code together with the IRTF stellar library. In
addition, the spectroscopic findings are reinforced using complementary
photometric techniques such as red-sequence and photometric redshift
estimation. Results. The mean spectroscopic redshift estimated from the NIR
spectra is z = 0.225 +- 0.014. This value presents a good agreement with that
obtained from photometric analysis, photoz = 0.21 +- 0.08, and the probability
distribution function of the galaxies in the studied region. Also, the
red-sequence slope is consistent with the one expected for NIR observations of

wide concentric arc(s), extending out to large galactocentric distances with
sharp outer edges. Recent observations of young massive star clusters in the
prominent outer shell of NGC 474 suggest that such systems host extreme
conditions of star formation. In this paper, we present a hydrodynamic
simulation of a galaxy merger and its transformation into a shell galaxy. We
analyse how the star formation activity evolves with time, location-wise within
the system, and what are the physical conditions for star formation. During the
interaction, an excess of dense gas appears, triggering a starburst, i.e. an
enhanced star formation rate and a reduced depletion time. Star formation
coincides with regions of high molecular gas fraction, such as the galactic
nucleus, spiral arms, and occasionally the tidal debris during the early stages
of the merger. Tidal interactions scatter stars into a stellar spheroid, while
the gas cools down and reforms a disc. The morphological transformation after
coalescence stabilises the gas and thus quenches star formation, without the
need for feedback from an active galactic nucleus. This evolution shows
similarities with a compaction scenario for compact quenched spheroids at
high-redshift, yet without a long red nugget phase. Shells appear after
coalescence, during the quenched phase, implying that they do not host the
conditions necessary for in situ star formation. The results suggest that
shell-forming mergers might be part of the process of turning blue late-type
galaxies into red and dead early-types.

for driving AGN feedback at large scales. However, without information on the
density of these outflows, we cannot determine how much kinetic power they are
imparting to the surrounding medium. Monitoring the response of the ionisation
state of the absorbing outflows to changes in the ionising continuum provides
the recombination timescale of the outflow, which is a function of the electron
density. We have developed a new self-consistent time-dependent photoionisation
model, TPHO, enabling the measurement of the plasma density through
time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy. The algorithm solves the full-time-dependent
energy and ionisation balance equations in a self-consistent fashion for all
the ionic species. The model can therefore reproduce the time-dependent
absorption spectrum of ionized outflows responding to changes in the ionizing
radiation of the AGN. We find that when the ionised gas is in a non-equilibrium
state its transmitted spectra are not accurately reproduced by standard
photoionisation models. Our simulations with the current X-ray grating
observations show that the spectral features identified as a
multiple-components warm absorber, might be in fact features of a time-changing
warm absorber and not distinctive components. The TPHO model facilitates
accurate photoionisation modelling in the presence of a variable ionising
source, thus providing constraints on the density and in turn the location of
the AGN outflows. Ascertaining these two parameters will provide important
insight into the role and impact of ionised outflows in AGN feedback.

observational cosmology soon, it is important to explore their potential
synergies and to maximise their scientific outcomes. In this study, we aim to
investigate the complementarity of the two upcoming space missions Euclid and
the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), focusing on weak lensing (WL)
cosmology. In particular, we analyse the photometric redshifts (photo-zs) and
the galaxy blending effects. For Euclid, WL measurements suffer from chromatic
PSF effects. For this, CSST can provide valuable information for Euclid to
obtain more accurate PSF, and to calibrate the color and color-gradient biases
for WL measurements.
  Methods. We create image simulations for different surveys, and quantify the
photo-z performance. For blending analyses, we employ high-resolution
HST/CANDELS data to mock Euclid, CSST, and an LSST-like survey. We analyse the
blending fraction for different cases, and the blending effects on galaxy
photometry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CSST can provide a large enough
number of high SNR multi-band galaxy images to calibrate the color-gradient
biases for Euclid.
  Results. The sky coverage of Euclid lies entirely within the CSST footprint.
The combination of Euclid with CSST data can be done more uniformly than with
the various ground-based data. Our studies show that by combining Euclid and
CSST, we can reach a photo-z precision of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} \approx 0.04$, and
an outlier fraction of $\eta\approx 2.4\%$. Because of the similarly high
resolutions, the data combination of Euclid and CSST can be relatively
straightforward for photometry. To include ground-based data, however,
sophisticated deblending utilizing priors from high-resolution space data is
demanded. The color-gradient biases for Euclid can be well calibrated to the
level of 0.1% using galaxies from CSST deep survey.

unconventional spin-orbit torques, leading to deterministic switching in

between conventional and unconventional spin-orbit torques on the magnetization

beyond which deterministic magnetization switching transitions to a
precessional or pinned state. Conversely, we showed that larger unconventional

an approximate expression that qualitatively describes the state diagram

factor, RF, particularly before exploitation and exploration. However,
accurately estimating requires data that is not necessarily available or

machine learning (ML), using readily available features, to estimate oil RF for
ten classes defined in this study. To construct the ML models, we applied the
XGBoost classification algorithm. Classification was chosen because recovery
factor is bounded from 0 to 1, much like probability. Three databases were
merged, leaving us with four different combinations to first train and test the
ML models and then further evaluate them using an independent database
including unseen data. The cross-validation method with ten folds was applied
on the training datasets to assess the effectiveness of the models. To evaluate
the accuracy and reliability of the models, the accuracy, neighborhood
accuracy, and macro averaged f1 score were determined. Overall, results showed
that the XGBoost classification algorithm could estimate the RF class with
reasonable accuracies as high as 0.49 in the training datasets, 0.34 in the
testing datasets and 0.2 in the independent databases used. We found that the
reliability of the XGBoost model depended on the data in the training dataset

that separating them from tailings before disposal is crucial. However, low
bitumen concentration in the tailings slurry and the complex transport

study establishes an Eulerian-Eulerian CFD model for an industrial-scale oil

the selection of carrier-solid and solid-bitumen drag models. The combination
of small and large particle sizes (i.e., 75 & 700 um) and bitumen droplet size
(i.e., 400 um) provided good agreement with field data in velocity profiles and
pressure drop. The validated model was subsequently extended to investigate the
influence of the secondary phase (i.e., bitumen droplets and bubbles) on flow
characteristics in a tailing pipeline. The investigation covered a range of
bitumen droplet size (100-400 um), bitumen fraction (0.0025-0.1), bubble size
(5-1000 um), and bubble fraction (0.0025-0.3) and their influences on the

One application is the first work-efficient parallel algorithm for computing
exact single-source shortest paths graphs -- resolving a major open problem in
parallel computing.
  Given a source vertex in a directed graph with polynomially-bounded
nonnegative integer lengths, the algorithm computes an exact shortest path tree
in $m \log^{O(1)} n$ work and $n^{1/2+o(1)}$ depth. Previously, no parallel
algorithm improving the trivial linear depths of Dijkstra's algorithm without
significantly increasing the work was known, even for the case of undirected
and unweighted graphs (i.e., for computing a BFS-tree).
  Our main result is a black-box transformation that uses $\log^{O(1)} n$
standard approximate distance computations to produce approximate distances
which also satisfy the subtractive triangle inequality (up to a
$(1+\varepsilon)$ factor) and even induce an exact shortest path tree in a
graph with only slightly perturbed edge lengths. These strengthened
approximations are algorithmically significantly more powerful and overcome
well-known and often encountered barriers for using approximate distances. In
directed graphs they can even be boosted to exact distances. This results in a
black-box transformation of any (parallel or distributed) algorithm for
approximate shortest paths in directed graphs into an algorithm computing exact
distances at essentially no cost. Applying this to the recent breakthroughs of
Fineman et al. for compute approximate SSSP-distances via approximate hopsets
gives new parallel and distributed algorithm for exact shortest paths.

Lawson-type exponential integrator (LTEI) methods. Due to the blowup of the
singular nonlinearity, i.e., $f(\rho)=\rho^{\alpha}$ with a fixed exponent
$\alpha<0$ goes to infinity when $\rho \to 0^+$ ($\rho = |\psi|^2$ represents
the density with $\psi$ being the complex-valued wave function or order
parameter), there are significant difficulties in designing accurate and
efficient numerical schemes to solve the sNLSE. In order to suppress the
round-off error and avoid blowup near $\rho = 0^+$, two types of
regularizations for the sNLSE are proposed with a small regularization
parameter $0 < \eps \ll 1$. One is based on the local energy regularization
(LER) for the sNLSE via regularizing the energy density $F(\rho) =
\frac{1}{\alpha+1}\rho^{\alpha+1}$ locally near $\rho = 0^+$ with a polynomial
approximation and then obtaining a local energy regularized nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation via energy variation. The other one is the global
nonlinearity regularization which directly regularizes the singular
nonlinearity $f(\rho)=\rho^{\alpha}$ to avoid blowup near $\rho = 0^+$. For the
regularized models, we apply the first-order Lie-Trotter time-splitting method
and Lawson-type exponential integrator method for temporal discretization and
combine with the Fourier pseudospectral method in space to numerically solve
them. Numerical examples are provided to show the convergence of the
regularized models to the sNLSE and they suggest that the local energy
regularization performs better than directly regularizing the singular
nonlinearity globally.

scale. Some systems even support real-time or near real-time data processing,
and can update metrics and statistics continuously. Many commonly used metrics,
such as clicks and page views, can be observed without much delay. However,
many important signals can only be observed after several hours or days, with
noise adding up over the duration of the episode. When episodical outcomes
follow a complex sequence of user-product interactions, it is difficult to
understand which interactions lead to the final outcome. There is no obvious
attribution logic for us to associate a positive or negative outcome back to
the actions and choices we made at different times. This attribution logic is
critical to unlocking more targeted and efficient measurement at a finer
granularity that could eventually lead to the full capability of reinforcement
learning. In this paper, we borrow the idea of Causal Surrogacy to model a
long-term outcome using leading indicators that are incrementally observed and
apply it as the value function to track the progress towards the final outcome
and attribute incrementally to various user-product interaction steps. Applying
this approach to the guest booking metric at Airbnb resulted in significant
variance reductions of 50% to 85%, while aligning well with the booking metric
itself. Continuous attribution allows us to assign a utility score to each
product page-view, and this score can be flexibly further aggregated to a
variety of units of interest, such as searches and listings. We provide

distribution networks will be imperative for the optimal operation of the power
grid. However, coupling models and formulations between transmission and
distribution is non-trivial, in particular due to the common practice of
modeling transmission systems as single-phase, and distribution systems as
multi-conductor phase-unbalanced. To enable the rapid prototyping of power flow
formulations, in particular in the modeling of the boundary conditions between
these two seemingly incompatible data models, we introduce PowerModelsITD.jl, a
free, open-source toolkit written in Julia for integrated
transmission-distribution (ITD) optimization that leverages mature optimization
libraries from the InfrastructureModels.jl-ecosystem. The primary objective of
the proposed framework is to provide baseline implementations of steady-state
ITD optimization problems, while providing a common platform for the evaluation
of emerging formulations and optimization problems. In this work, we introduce
the nonlinear formulations currently supported in PowerModelsITD.jl, which
include AC-polar, AC-rectangular, current-voltage, and a linear network
transportation model. Results are validated using combinations of IEEE
transmission and distribution networks.

in transversally disordered media exhibits an analogue spin Hall effect (SHE).
In non-resonant materials, however, the SHE shows up at a scale much larger
than the mean free path, making its observation challenging due to the
exponential attenuation of the coherent mode. Here, we show that in disordered
photonic arrays, the SHE on the contrary appears at a scale smaller than the
mean free path if one operates in the close vicinity of the second,
transverse-magnetic Mie resonance of the array. In combination with a weak
measurement, this gives rise to a giant SHE visible in optically-thin arrays.
Furthermore, we find that by additionally exploiting the coherent flash of
light following the abrupt extinction of the incoming beam, one can achieve a
time-dependent SHE, observable at large optical thickness as well.

utilizing sparse cross-entropy (CXE) and the other Kullback-Liebler Divergence
(KLD). Both networks use labels drawn from the crowdsourced consensus. For the
second network, the KLD is calculated with respect to the proposed Normalized

hurricane track prediction. The method is based on the statistical fitting of
historic numerical model track forecasts to the observed storm positions and
learning from their historical errors and biases. Our method is closest to the
HFIP Corrected Consensus Approach (HCCA) methodology while using an alternative
model formulation. Our method creates a separate consensus model for each
forecast hour making it possible to independently correct the bias of each
input model for that specific hour. This approach, which we call the Hurricane
Track Fit (HFIT) model, is computationally efficient and scalable to additional
numerical models as input, and it produces interpretable coefficients weighing
model contributions.
  The new method is evaluated for the 2014-2021 hurricane seasons in the
Atlantic basin using the input from the best-performing operational track
forecast guidance at the National Hurricane Center (NHC): the U.S. National
Weather Service Global Forecast System deterministic and ensemble mean models,
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts deterministic model, the NWS
Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model and the NHC equally weighted
numerical model track consensus (TVCA). The results of the cross-validation for
the 2014-2021 hurricane track dataset show that the HFIT consensus model
consistently reduces the track forecast errors compared to those from the input
models and the official NHC forecasts (OFCL). For example, at 24h the HFIT
track forecast errors are smaller by 18.5% and 15.6% than those in AVNI and

In particular, we demonstrate that in parallel with the evolution of the

the energy spent for communication. Approaches like time slotted channel
hopping pursue this goal by performing frame exchanges according to a
predefined schedule, which helps reducing the duty cycle. Unfortunately,
whenever the receiving radio interface is active but nobody in the network is
transmitting, idle listening occurs. If the traffic pattern is known in
advance, as in the relevant case of periodic sensing, proactive reduction of
idle listening (PRIL) noticeably lowers energy waste by disabling receivers
when no frames are expected for them. Optimal PRIL operation demands that, at
any time, the transmitter and receiver sides of a link have a coherent view of
its state (either enabled or disabled). However, this is not ensured in the
presence of acknowledgment frame losses. This paper presents and analyzes some
strategies to cope with such events. An extensive experimental campaign has
been carried out through discrete event simulation to determine what
consequences above errors may have from both a functional and performance
viewpoint. Results show that, although no strategy is optimal in all
circumstances, different solutions can be profitably adopted depending on the

for various eternal black holes in two dimensions are investigated. It is shown
that the late-time behaviors of some of the modes of the quantum fields and of
the symmetric two-point function are determined by infrared effects. The nature
of these effects depends upon whether there is an effective potential in the
mode equation and what form this potential takes. Here, three cases are
considered, one with no potential and two with potentials that are nonnegative
everywhere and are zero on the event horizon of the black hole and zero at
either infinity or the cosmological horizon. Specifically, the potentials are a
delta function potential and the potential that occurs for a massive scalar
field in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. In both cases, scattering effects
remove infrared divergences in the mode functions that would otherwise arise
from the normalization process. When such infrared divergences are removed, it
is found that the modes that are positive frequency with respect to the Kruskal
time on the past black hole horizon approach zero in the limit that the radial
coordinate is fixed and the time coordinate goes to infinity. In contrast, when
there is no potential and thus infrared divergences occur, the same modes
approach nonzero constant values in the late-time limit when the radial
coordinate is held fixed. The behavior of the symmetric two-point function when
the field is in the Unruh state is investigated for the case of a delta
function potential in certain asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes in two
dimensions. The removal of the infrared divergences in the mode functions
results in the elimination of terms that grow linearly in time.

been more frequent. However, if detected early, the 5-year survival rate for

can be pivotal in monitoring and treatment planning. In this work, ten models
and four augmentation configurations are trained on the ISIC 2016 dataset. The
performance and overfitting are compared utilizing five metrics. Our results
show that the U-Net-Resnet50 and the R2U-Net have the highest metrics value,
along with two data augmentation scenarios. We also investigate CBAM and AG
blocks in the U-Net architecture, which enhances segmentation performance at a
meager computational cost. In addition, we propose using pyramid, AG, and CBAM

two individually. Finally, our experiments show that models that have exploited
attention modules successfully overcome common skin lesion segmentation

generalization and fast training times. For instance, stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) tends to have good generalization; however, adaptive gradient
methods have superior training times. Momentum can help accelerate training
with SGD, but so far there has been no principled way to select the momentum
hyperparameter. Here we study implicit bias arising from the interplay between
SGD with label noise and momentum in the training of overparametrized neural
networks. We find that scaling the momentum hyperparameter $1-\beta$ with the
learning rate to the power of $2/3$ maximally accelerates training, without
sacrificing generalization. To analytically derive this result we develop an
architecture-independent framework, where the main assumption is the existence
of a degenerate manifold of global minimizers, as is natural in
overparametrized models. Training dynamics display the emergence of two
characteristic timescales that are well-separated for generic values of the
hyperparameters. The maximum acceleration of training is reached when these two
timescales meet, which in turn determines the scaling limit we propose. We
perform experiments, including matrix sensing and ResNet on CIFAR10, which
provide evidence for the robustness of these results.

  Computational Complexity","26 pages, 3 algorithms, 3 figures",,,,"cs.LG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study a class of distributed optimization algorithms that aim to alleviate
high communication costs by allowing the clients to perform multiple local
gradient-type training steps prior to communication. While methods of this type
have been studied for about a decade, the empirically observed acceleration
properties of local training eluded all attempts at theoretical understanding.
In a recent breakthrough, Mishchenko et al. (ICML 2022) proved that local
training, when properly executed, leads to provable communication acceleration,
and this holds in the strongly convex regime without relying on any data
similarity assumptions. However, their method ProxSkip requires all clients to
take the same number of local training steps in each communication round.
Inspired by a common sense intuition, we start our investigation by
conjecturing that clients with ``less important'' data should be able to get
away with fewer local training steps without this impacting the overall
communication complexity of the method. It turns out that this intuition is
correct: we managed to redesign the original ProxSkip method to achieve this.
In particular, we prove that our modified method, for which coin the name
GradSkip, converges linearly under the same assumptions, has the same
accelerated communication complexity, while the number of local gradient steps
can be reduced relative to a local condition number. We further generalize our
method by extending the randomness of probabilistic alternations to arbitrary
unbiased compression operators and considering a generic proximable
regularizer. This generalization, which we call GradSkip+, recovers several
related methods in the literature as special cases. Finally, we present an
empirical study on carefully designed toy problems that confirm our theoretical
claims.

those problems can be avoided by an evaluation based on ground truth. General
criticisms of synthetic experiments are that they are too simplified and not

tailored to a realistic generative task. We focus on categorical data and
introduce an appropriately scalable evaluation method. Our method involves
tasking a generative model to learn a distribution in a high-dimensional
setting. We then successively bin the large space to obtain smaller probability
spaces where meaningful statistical tests can be applied. We consider
increasingly large probability spaces, which correspond to increasingly
difficult modeling tasks and compare the generative models based on the highest
task difficulty they can reach before being detected as being too far from the
ground truth. We validate our evaluation procedure with synthetic experiments

Instead, their interactions are mediated through their connections to
interference units on the other side of the graph. Examples of this type of

cluster-randomized design is a popular method to mitigate interference when the

qubits to wavepacket modes localized to varying length scales and approximate a
systems Gibbs state as a mixed state of these modes. The TMERA is a based on
the deep multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (DMERA); a TMERA
modifies a ground-state DMERA circuit by preparing each input qubit as a mixed
state. The excitation probabilities for input qubits serve as variational
parameters used to target particular temperature Gibbs states. Since a TMERA is
a special case of the product spectrum ansatz for thermal states, it is simple
to prepare, analyze, and optimize. We benchmark the TMERA on the transverse

Here, we report on the self-assembly of a supramolecular pseudo-cube formed

the observation of delayed fluorescence due to a bright excited multimer state,

the photophysical properties of the subcomponents but the geometric structure

can disrupt the precise calibration, which results in contaminating the

spectrum. For Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), we simulate and
characterize the perturbed primary beams induced by feed motions such as axial,
lateral, and tilting motions, above the 14-meter dish. To understand the effect
of the perturbed beams, visibility measurements are modeled with two different
foreground components, point sources and diffuse sources, and we find different
feed motions present a different reaction to each type of sky source. HERA's
redundant-baseline calibration in the presence of non-redundant antenna beams
due to feed motions introduces chromatic errors in gain solutions, which
produces foreground power leakage into the EoR window. The observed leakage
from vertical feed motions comes predominately from point sources around

motion comes predominately from the diffuse components near the horizon.
Mitigation of chromatic gain errors will be necessary for robust detection of

the common synergy of the two agents. Secondly, a transferability metric is
created that approximates how well the mapping between a pair of agents will
perform compared to another pair before creating the motion mapping models.
Thus, it can guide the formation of an optimal mapping chain for the new

demonstrated 1) The SyDa method improves the accuracy and generalizability of
the pair mappings, 2) the SyDa method allows for bidirectional mapping that
does not prioritize the direction of mapping motion, and 3) the transferability
metric measures how compatible two agents are for accurate teleoperation. The
combination of the SyDa method and transferability metric creates generalizable

content and natural language, thus learning fine-grained joint representations
of vision and language (a.k.a. V-L representations) is of paramount importance.
Recently, various pre-trained V-L models are proposed to learn V-L
representations and achieve improved results in many tasks. However, the
mainstream models process both vision and language inputs with the same set of
attention matrices. As a result, the generated V-L representations are
entangled in one common latent space. To tackle this problem, we propose
DiMBERT (short for Disentangled Multimodal-Attention BERT), which is a novel
framework that applies separated attention spaces for vision and language, and
the representations of multi-modalities can thus be disentangled explicitly. To
enhance the correlation between vision and language in disentangled spaces, we
introduce the visual concepts to DiMBERT which represent visual information in
textual format. In this manner, visual concepts help to bridge the gap between
the two modalities. We pre-train DiMBERT on a large amount of image-sentence
pairs on two tasks: bidirectional language modeling and sequence-to-sequence
language modeling. After pre-train, DiMBERT is further fine-tuned for the
downstream tasks. Experiments show that DiMBERT sets new state-of-the-art
performance on three tasks (over four datasets), including both generation
tasks (image captioning and visual storytelling) and classification tasks
(referring expressions). The proposed DiM (short for Disentangled
Multimodal-Attention) module can be easily incorporated into existing
pre-trained V-L models to boost their performance, up to a 5% increase on the
representative task. Finally, we conduct a systematic analysis and demonstrate
the effectiveness of our DiM and the introduced visual concepts.

observations to recover the underlying flow field. One major challenge in
Lagrangian data assimilation is the intrinsic nonlinearity that impedes using
exact Bayesian formulae for the state estimation of high-dimensional systems.
In this paper, an analytically tractable mathematical framework for
continuous-in-time Lagrangian data assimilation is developed. It preserves the
nonlinearity in the observational processes while approximating the forecast
model of the underlying flow field using linear stochastic models (LSMs). A
critical feature of the framework is that closed analytic formulae are
available for solving the posterior distribution, which facilitates
mathematical analysis and numerical simulations. First, an efficient iterative
algorithm is developed in light of the analytically tractable statistics. It
accurately estimates the parameters in the LSMs using only a small number of
the observed tracer trajectories. Next, the framework facilitates the
development of several computationally efficient approximate filters and the
quantification of the associated uncertainties. A cheap approximate filter with
a diagonal posterior covariance derived from the asymptotic analysis of the
posterior estimate is shown to be skillful in recovering incompressible flows.
It is also demonstrated that randomly selecting a small number of tracers at
each time step as observations can reduce the computational cost while
retaining the data assimilation accuracy. Finally, based on a prototype model
in geophysics, the framework with LSMs is shown to be skillful in filtering
nonlinear turbulent flow fields with strong non-Gaussian features.

parameters to store the necessary knowledge for solving multiple natural
language tasks in zero/few-shot settings. In addition, it is hard to adapt to
the evolving world knowledge without the costly model re-training. In this
paper, we develop a novel semi-parametric language model architecture,
Knowledge-in-Context (KiC), which empowers a parametric text-to-text language
model with a knowledge-rich external memory. Specifically, the external memory
contains six different types of knowledge: entity, dictionary, commonsense,
event, script, and causality knowledge. For each input instance, the KiC model
adaptively selects a knowledge type and retrieves the most helpful pieces of
knowledge. The input instance along with its knowledge augmentation is fed into
a text-to-text model (e.g., T5) to generate the output answer, where both the
input and the output are in natural language forms after prompting.
Interestingly, we find that KiC can be identified as a special
mixture-of-experts (MoE) model, where the knowledge selector plays the role of
a router that is used to determine the sequence-to-expert assignment in MoE.
This key observation inspires us to develop a novel algorithm for training KiC
with an instance-adaptive knowledge selector. As a knowledge-rich
semi-parametric language model, KiC only needs a much smaller parametric part
to achieve superior zero-shot performance on unseen tasks. By evaluating on 40+
different tasks, we show that KiC_Large with 770M parameters easily outperforms
large language models (LMs) that are 4-39x larger by a large margin. We also
demonstrate that KiC exhibits emergent abilities at a much smaller model scale

whole space $\mathbb R^3$. The beautiful work of Paicu and Zhang \cite{ZHANG1}
solved the case when the spatial domain is bounded in the $x_1$-direction by
observing a crucial Poincar\'{e} type inequality. Motivated by this
Navier-Stokes open problem and by experimental observations on the stabilizing
effects of background magnetic fields, this paper intends to understand the
global well-posedness and stability of a special 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)

appears to be impossible. By discovering the mathematical mechanism of the
experimentally observed stabilizing effect and introducing several innovative
techniques to deal with the derivative loss difficulties, we are able to bound

  electrodynamics","7 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Micro-/nanocavities that combine high quality factor ($Q$) and small mode
volume ($V$) have been used to enhance light-matter interactions for cavity
quantum electrodynamics (cQED). Whispering gallery mode (WGM) geometries such
as microdisks and microrings support high-$Q$ and are design- and
fabrication-friendly, but $V$ is often limited to tens of cubic wavelengths to
avoid WGM radiation. The stronger modal confinement provided by either
one-dimensional or two-dimensional photonic crystal defect geometries can yield
sub-cubic-wavelength $V$, yet the requirements on precise design and
dimensional control are typically much more stringent to ensure high-$Q$. Given
their complementary features, there has been sustained interest in geometries
that combine the advantages of WGM and photonic crystal cavities. Recently, a
`microgear' photonic crystal ring (MPhCR) has shown promise in enabling
additional defect localization ($>$ 10$\times$ reduction of $V$) of a WGM,
while maintaining high-$Q$ ($\approx10^6$) and other WGM characteristics in
ease of coupling and design. However, the unit cell geometry used is unlike
traditional PhC cavities, and etched surfaces may be too close to embedded
quantum nodes (quantum dots, atomic defect spins, etc.) for cQED applications.
Here, we report two novel PhCR designs with `rod' and `slit' unit cells, whose
geometries are more traditional and suitable for solid-state cQED. Both rod and
slit PhCRs have high-$Q$ ($>10^6$) with WGM coupling properties preserved. A
further $\approx$~10$\times$ reduction of $V$ by defect localization is
observed in rod PhCRs. Moreover, both fundamental and 2nd-order PhC modes
co-exist in slit PhCRs with high $Q$s and good coupling. Our work showcases
that high-$Q/V$ PhCRs are in general straightforward to design and fabricate
and are a promising platform to explore for cQED.

seemingly unrelated, all produce observable characteristics evolving with time.
Within this broad scope, departures from normal temporal behavior range from
academically interesting to potentially catastrophic. New algorithms for time
series anomaly detection (TAD) are therefore certainly in demand. With the
advent of newly accessible quantum processing units (QPUs), exploring a quantum
approach to TAD is now relevant and is the topic of this work. Our approach -
Quantum Variational Rewinding, or, QVR - trains a family of parameterized
unitary time-devolution operators to cluster normal time series instances
encoded within quantum states. Unseen time series are assigned an anomaly score
based upon their distance from the cluster center, which, beyond a given
threshold, classifies anomalous behavior. After a first demonstration with a
simple and didactic case, QVR is used to study the real problem of identifying
anomalous behavior in cryptocurrency market data. Finally, multivariate time
series from the cryptocurrency use case are studied using IBM's Falcon r5.11H
family of superconducting transmon QPUs, where anomaly score errors resulting
from hardware noise are shown to be reducible by as much as 20% using advanced
error mitigation techniques.

that perform data analysis while searching for anomalies in their environment.
Indeed, the development of deep learning techniques paved the way to build more
complex and effective threat detection models. However, training those models
may be computationally infeasible in most Edge or IoT devices. Current
approaches rely on powerful centralized servers that receive data from all
their parties - violating basic privacy constraints and substantially affecting
response times and operational costs due to the huge communication overheads.
To mitigate these issues, Federated Learning emerged as a promising approach,
where different agents collaboratively train a shared model, without exposing
training data to others or requiring a compute-intensive centralized
infrastructure. This work presents GowFed, a novel network threat detection
system that combines the usage of Gower Dissimilarity matrices and Federated
averaging. Different approaches of GowFed have been developed based on state-of
the-art knowledge: (1) a vanilla version; and (2) a version instrumented with
an attention mechanism. Furthermore, each variant has been tested using
simulation oriented tools provided by TensorFlow Federated framework. In the
same way, a centralized analogous development of the Federated systems is
carried out to explore their differences in terms of scalability and
performance - across a set of designed experiments/scenarios. Overall, GowFed
intends to be the first stepping stone towards the combined usage of Federated

design and operation of magnetically confined fusion reactors. Unfortunately,
the extreme anisotropy present in magnetized plasmas results in thin boundary
layers that are expensive to resolve. This work investigates how mesh
refinement strategies might reduce that expense to allow for more efficient
simulation. It is first verified that higher order discretization only realizes
the proper rate of convergence once the mesh resolves the thin boundary layer,
motivating the focusing of refinement on the boundary layer. Three mesh
refinement strategies are investigated: one that focuses the refinement across
the layer by using rectangular elements with a ratio equal to the boundary
layer width, one that allows for exponential growth in mesh spacing away from
the layer, and one adaptive strategy utilizing the established Zienkiewicz and
Zhu error estimator. Across 4 two-dimensional test cases with high anisotropy,
the adaptive mesh refinement strategy consistently achieves the same accuracy
as uniform refinement using orders of magnitude less degrees of freedom. In the
test case where the magnetic field is aligned with the mesh, the other
refinement strategies also show substantial improvement in efficiency. This
work also includes a discussion generalizing the results to larger magnetic
anisotropy ratios and to three-dimensional problems. It is shown that isotropic
mesh refinement requires degrees of freedom on the order of either the layer
width (2D) or the square of the layer width (3D), whereas anisotropic
refinement requires a number on the order of the log of layer width for all
dimensions. It is also shown that the number of conjugate gradient iterations
scales as a power of layer width when preconditioned with algebraic multigrid,
whereas the number is independent of layer width when preconditioned with ILU.

This fills an important multi-wavelength gap in our knowledge of this key

synchrotron emission and the source size is estimated to be 66.9 pc. The
observed flux density ratios at 233 GHz are similar to those measured in radio,

$10-10^3M_{\odot}$ PBHs with a power law mass function. Our analysis shows that
the anomalous flux density ratio for B1422+231 can be explained by a lens model

the potential for new constraints on PBH dark matter using ALMA observations of

Er and Ho) compounds that exhibit a colossal first-order charge density wave
(CDW) transition where there is a strong orthorhombic-to-triclinic distortion
of the lattice accompanied by superlattice reflections. The analysis by
single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) has revealed that the Ir-Ir zigzag
chains along c are responsible for the CDW in all three compounds. The
replacement of the rare earth element from non-magnetic Lu to magnetic Er or Ho
lowers TCDW, where TCDWLu = 200 K, TCDWEr = 150 K and TCDWHo = 90 K. Out of the
three compounds, Ho2Ir3Si5 is the only system where second-order superlattice
reflections could be observed, indicative of an anharmonic shape of the
modulation wave. The CDW transition is observed as anomalies in the temperature
dependencies of the specific heat, electrical conductivity and magnetic
susceptibility, which includes a large hysteresis of 90 to 130 K for all
measured properties, thus corroborating the SXRD measurements. Similar to
previously reported Er2Ir3Si5, there appears to be a coupling between CDW and
magnetism such that the Ho3+ magnetic moments are influenced by the CDW
transition, even in the paramagnetic state. Moreover, earlier investigations on
polycrystalline material revealed antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at TN = 5.1
K, whereas AFM order is suppressed and only the CDW is present in our highly
ordered single-crystal. First-principles calculations predict Ho2Ir3Si5 to be a
metal with coexisting electron and hole pockets at the Fermi level. The Ho and
Ir atoms have spherically symmetric metallic-type charge density distributions
that are prone to CDW distortion. Phonon calculations affirm that the Ir atoms
are primarily responsible for the CDW distortion, which is in agreement with
the experiment.

regime, the heat transfer from the rough solid obstacles to the fluid inside
the porous medium is less than that from a smooth solid obstacle. In the coarse
roughness regime, there is an enhancement in the heat transfer from the rough
solid obstacle to the fluid inside the porous medium. Total drag reduction is
also observed in the fine roughness regime for the smallest roughness particle
height. The surface roughness particle spacing determines the fractional area
of the solid obstacle surface covered by recirculating, reattached, and
stagnating flow. As the roughness particle spacing increases, there are two
competing factors for the heat transfer rate: increase due to more surface area
covered by reattached flow, and decrease due to the decrease in the number of
roughness particles on the solid obstacle surface. Decreasing the porosity and
increasing the Reynolds number amplify the effect of the surface roughness on
the microscale flow.

not always give optimal results and may miss vital aggregate information. This
paper investigates incorporating a performance metric alongside differentiable

performance and interpretation by assuming statistical distributions on this
performance metric for dynamic weighting. The focus is on van Rijsbergens
$F_{\beta}$ metric -- a popular choice for gauging classification performance.
Through distributional assumptions on the $F_{\beta}$, an intermediary link can
be established to the standard binary cross-entropy via dynamic penalty
weights. First, the $F_{\beta}$ metric is reformulated to facilitate assuming
statistical distributions with accompanying proofs for the cumulative density
function. These probabilities are used within a knee curve algorithm to find an
optimal $\beta$ or $\beta_{opt}$. This $\beta_{opt}$ is used as a weight or
penalty in the proposed weighted binary cross-entropy. Experimentation on
publicly available data with imbalanced classes mostly yields better and
interpretable results as compared to the baseline. For example, for the IMDB
text data with known labeling errors, a 14% boost is shown. This methodology

Curiosity-driven exploration is a simple yet efficient approach that quantifies
this novelty as the prediction error of the agent's curiosity module, an
internal neural network that is trained to predict the agent's next state given

Straightforward multi-agent extensions of curiosity-driven exploration take
into consideration either individual or collective novelty only and thus, they
do not provide a distinct but collaborative intrinsic reward signal that is
essential for learning in cooperative multi-agent tasks. In this work, we
propose a curiosity-driven multi-agent exploration method that has the mixed

the first head and the next joint observation in the second head. Second, we
design the intrinsic reward formula to be the sum of the individual and joint

reduced NV formation efficiency due to the diamond surface's role as a vacancy

constructed by registering together 2.5D monocular depth predictions from the
2D video frames and associating the 2.5D scene regions with the outputs of an

prescribed performance with prescribed-time convergence for strict-feedback
systems with mismatched uncertainties and unknown nonlinearities. Firstly, to
quantify the transient and steady performance constraints of the tracking
error, a class of prescribed-time prescribed performance functions are
designed, and a novel error transformation function is introduced to remove the
initial value constraints and solve the singularity problem in existing works.
Secondly, based on dynamic surface control methods, controllers with or without
approximating structures are established to guarantee that the tracking error
achieves prescribed transient performance and converges into a prescribed
bounded set within prescribed time. In particular, the settling time and
initial value of the prescribed performance function are completely independent
of initial conditions of the tracking error and system parameters, which
improves existing results. Moreover, with a novel Lyapunov-like energy
function, not only the differential explosion problem frequently occurring in
backstepping techniques is solved, but the drawback of the semi-global
boundedness of tracking error induced by dynamic surface control can be
overcome. The validity and effectiveness of the main results are verified by
numerical simulations on practical examples.

  Graph Convolutional Network",,,,,"cs.CV cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the rapid development of 3D vision, point cloud has become an
increasingly popular 3D visual media content. Due to the irregular structure,
point cloud has posed novel challenges to the related research, such as
compression, transmission, rendering and quality assessment. In these latest
researches, point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) has attracted wide attention
due to its significant role in guiding practical applications, especially in
many cases where the reference point cloud is unavailable. However, current
no-reference metrics which based on prevalent deep neural network have apparent
disadvantages. For example, to adapt to the irregular structure of point cloud,
they require preprocessing such as voxelization and projection that introduce
extra distortions, and the applied grid-kernel networks, such as Convolutional
Neural Networks, fail to extract effective distortion-related features.
Besides, they rarely consider the various distortion patterns and the
philosophy that PCQA should exhibit shifting, scaling, and rotational
invariance. In this paper, we propose a novel no-reference PCQA metric named
the Graph convolutional PCQA network (GPA-Net). To extract effective features
for PCQA, we propose a new graph convolution kernel, i.e., GPAConv, which
attentively captures the perturbation of structure and texture. Then, we
propose the multi-task framework consisting of one main task (quality
regression) and two auxiliary tasks (distortion type and degree predictions).
Finally, we propose a coordinate normalization module to stabilize the results
of GPAConv under shift, scale and rotation transformations. Experimental
results on two independent databases show that GPA-Net achieves the best
performance compared to the state-of-the-art no-reference PCQA metrics, even
better than some full-reference metrics in some cases.

[Science 372, (2021), 852], we have explored the sensing properties of this
material towards the catechol biomolecule by performing the first-principles
density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations. Pristine
biphenylene sheet adsorbs catechol molecule with a binding energy of -0.35 eV,
which can be systematically improved by decorating the transition metals (Ag,
Au, Pd, and Ti) at various possible sites of biphenylene. It is observed that
the catechol molecule is adsorbed on Pd and Ti-decorated biphenylene sheets
with strong adsorption energies of -1.00 eV and -2.54 eV, respectively. The
interaction of the catechol molecule with biphenylene and metal-decorated
biphenylene is due to the charge transfer from the O-2p orbitals of the
catechol molecule to the C-2p orbitals of biphenylene and d-orbitals of metals
in metal-decorated biphenylene, respectively. From the Bader charge
calculation, we found that 0.05e amount of charge is transferred from the
catechol molecule to pristine biphenylene, which gets almost double (~0.1e) for
the Ti-decorated biphenylene sheet. The diffusion energy barrier for the
clustering of the Pd and Ti atoms comes out to be 2.39 eV and 4.29 eV, computed
by performing the climbing-image nudged elastic band calculations. We found
that the catechol molecule gets desorbed from the pristine biphenylene sheet
even at 100 K but remains attached to metal (Pd, Ti) decorated biphenylene
sheets at room temperature by performing the ab-initio molecular dynamics
simulations. The Ti-decorated biphenylene sheet has more sensitivity toward
catechol adsorption while the Pd-decorated biphenylene sheet has a suitable
recovery time at 500 K. The results suggest that the Pd and Ti-decorated
biphenylene sheets are promising materials for catechol detection.

the streamwise and spanwise length scales of the outer motions do not alter

approximately 15.5, and the counterpart of density and pressure fluctuations is

code have shown impressive capabilities in automatic code generation scenarios.
Development and evaluation of these models has largely been driven by offline
functional correctness metrics, which consider a task to be solved if the
generated code passes corresponding unit tests. While functional correctness is
clearly an important property of a code generation model, we argue that it may
not fully capture what programmers value when collaborating with their AI pair
programmers. For example, while a nearly correct suggestion that does not
consider edge cases may fail a unit test, it may still provide a substantial
starting point or hint to the programmer, thereby reducing total needed effort
to complete a coding task. To investigate this, we conduct a user study with
(N=49) experienced programmers, and find that while both correctness and effort
correlate with value, the association is strongest for effort. We argue that
effort should be considered as an important dimension of evaluation in code
generation scenarios.
  We also find that functional correctness remains better at identifying the
highest-value generations; but participants still saw considerable value in
code that failed unit tests. Conversely, similarity-based metrics are very good
at identifying the lowest-value generations among those that fail unit tests.
Based on these findings, we propose a simple hybrid metric, which combines
functional correctness and similarity-based metrics to capture different
dimensions of what programmers might value and show that this hybrid metric
more strongly correlates with both value and effort. Our findings emphasize the
importance of designing human-centered metrics that capture what programmers
need from and value in their AI pair programmers.

Several Nash equilibrium refinement concepts have been proposed and studied for

quasi-perfect equilibrium. These concepts are robust to certain arbitrarily
small mistakes, and are guaranteed to always exist; however, we argue that

refinement concept for extensive-form games called observable perfect
equilibrium in which the solution is robust over trembles in
publicly-observable action probabilities (not necessarily over all action
probabilities that may not be observable by opposing players). Observable
perfect equilibrium correctly captures the assumption that the opponent is
playing as rationally as possible given mistakes that have been observed (while
previous solution concepts do not). We prove that observable perfect

quantum annealing, the state tends towards global minima and therefore we
restrict the second classical state to a minimum solution of the given Ising
problem. This susceptibility mapping, when enumerated across all initial
states, shows in detail the behavior of the quantum annealer during reverse
annealing. The procedure is experimentally demonstrated on three small test
Ising's which were embedded in parallel on the D-Wave Advantage_system4.1.
Analysis of the state transition mapping shows detailed characteristics of the
reverse annealing process including intermediate state transition paths, which
are visually represented as state transition networks.

it is not regularized by an energy cutoff, indeed normal modes of all energies

explains the old observation that an energy cutoff of the kink Hamiltonian

impose that the regularized kink sector Hamiltonian is unitarily equivalent to
the regularized vacuum sector Hamiltonian. This condition implies that the two

layers of the same 2D material, with different rotation and translation,
exhibits ferroelectricity. By performing systematic group theory analysis, we
find out all the possible BSF in all the 80 layer groups (LGs) and discover the
rules about the creation and annihilation of symmetries in the bilayer. Our
general theory can not only explain all the previous findings (including
sliding ferroelectricity), but also provide new perspective. Interestingly, the
direction of the electric polarization of the bilayer could be totally
different from that of the single layer. In particular, the bilayer could
become ferroelectric after properly stacking two centrosymmetric non-polar
monolayers. By means of first-principles simulations, we demonstrate that the
ferroelectricity and thus multiferroicity can be introduced to the prototypical
2D ferromagnetic centrosymmetric material CrI3 by stacking. Furthermore, we
find that the out-of-plane electric polarization in bilayer CrI3 is interlocked
with the in-plane electric polarization, suggesting that the out-of-plane
polarization can be manipulated in a deterministic way through the application
of an in-plane electric field. The present BSF theory lays a solid foundation
for designing a large number of bilayer ferroelectrics and thus colorful
platforms for fundamental studies and applications.

recently to estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). If the
features at hand cannot explain all heterogeneity, the individual treatment
effects (ITEs) can seriously deviate from the CATE. In this work, we
demonstrate how the distributions of the ITE and the estimated CATE can differ
when a causal random forest (CRF) is applied. We extend the CRF to estimate the
difference in conditional variance between treated and controls. If the ITE
distribution equals the CATE distribution, this difference in variance should
be small. If they differ, an additional causal assumption is necessary to
quantify the heterogeneity not captured by the CATE distribution. The
conditional variance of the ITE can be identified when the individual effect is
independent of the outcome under no treatment given the measured features.
Then, in the cases where the ITE and CATE distributions differ, the extended
CRF can appropriately estimate the characteristics of the ITE distribution
while the CRF fails to do so.

to future environmental change and to manage these responses. To make such
predictions and management actions robust to novel futures, we need to
accurately characterize how organisms experience their environments and the
biological mechanisms by which they respond. All organisms are
thermodynamically connected to their environments through the exchange of heat
and water at fine spatial and temporal scales and this exchange can be captured
with biophysical models. Although mechanistic models based on biophysical
ecology have a long history of development and application, their use in global
change biology remains limited despite their enormous promise and increasingly
accessible software. We contend that greater understanding and training in the
theory and methods of biophysical models is vital to expand their application.
Our review shows how biophysical models can be implemented to understand and
predict climate change impacts on species' behavior, phenology, survival,
distribution, and abundance. We illustrate the types of outputs that can be
generated, and the data inputs required for different implementations. Examples
range from simple calculations of body temperature to more complex analyses of
species' distribution limits based on projected energy and water balances,
accounting for behavior and phenology. We outline challenges that currently
limit the widespread application of biophysical models. We discuss progress and
future developments that could allow these models to be applied to many species
across large spatial extents and timeframes. We highlight how biophysical
models are uniquely suited to solve global change biology problems that involve
predicting and interpreting responses to environmental variability and
extremes, multiple or shifting constraints, and novel abiotic or biotic

estimands. On the other hand, the hazard difference has been shown to remain
unaffected by the selection of frailty factors over time. Therefore, observed
hazard differences can be used as an unbiased estimator for the causal hazard
differences in the absence of confounding. However, in the presence of effect
(on the hazard) heterogeneity, the hazard difference is also affected by
selection. In this work, we formalize how the observed hazard difference (from

modifiers in the exposed group and thus deviates from the causal hazard
difference of interest. Such selection may result in a non-linear integrated
hazard difference curve even when the individual causal effects are
time-invariant. Therefore, a homogeneous time-varying causal additive effect on
the hazard can not be distinguished from a constant but heterogeneous causal

this dynamical method to the theory of divisibility. We compare two notions of
valuative spectra present in the literature and we introduce a third notion,
which is implicit in an article devoted to the dynamical theory of
algebraically closed discrete valued fields. The two first notions are
respectively due to Huber \& Knebusch and to Coquand. We prove that the
corresponding valuative lattices are essentially the same. We establish formal
Valuativestellens\""atze corresponding to these theories, and we compare the

training samples. Recent work has addressed the problem using transfer learning
approach, leveraging a GAN pretrained on a large-scale source domain dataset
and adapting that model to the target domain based on very limited target
domain samples. Central to recent FSIG methods are knowledge preserving
criteria, which aim to select a subset of source model's knowledge to be
preserved into the adapted model. However, a major limitation of existing
methods is that their knowledge preserving criteria consider only source
domain/source task, and they fail to consider target domain/adaptation task in
selecting source model's knowledge, casting doubt on their suitability for
setups of different proximity between source and target domain. Our work makes
two contributions. As our first contribution, we re-visit recent FSIG works and
their experiments. Our important finding is that, under setups which assumption
of close proximity between source and target domains is relaxed, existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods which consider only source domain/source task
in knowledge preserving perform no better than a baseline fine-tuning method.
To address the limitation of existing methods, as our second contribution, we
propose Adaptation-Aware kernel Modulation (AdAM) to address general FSIG of
different source-target domain proximity. Extensive experimental results show
that the proposed method consistently achieves SOTA performance across
source/target domains of different proximity, including challenging setups when
source and target domains are more apart. Project Page:

emerged rapidly. This literature has focused on (conditional) average causal
effect estimation. When (remaining) variability of individual causal effects
(ICEs) is considerable, average effects may be less informative, and possibly
misleading for an individual. The fundamental problem of causal inference
precludes the estimation of the joint distribution of potential outcomes
without making assumptions, while this distribution is necessary to describe
the heterogeneity of causal effects. In this paper, we describe these
assumptions and present a family of flexible latent variable models that can be
used to study individual effect modification and estimate the ICE distribution
from cross-sectional data. We will also discuss how the distribution is
affected by misspecification of the error distribution or ignoring possible
confounding-effect heterogeneity. How latent variable models can be applied and
validated in practice is illustrated in a case study on the effect of Hepatic
Steatosis on a clinical precursor to heart failure. Assuming that there is (i)
no unmeasured confounding and (ii) independence of the individual effect
modifier and the potential outcome under no exposure, we conclude that the
individual causal effect distribution deviates from Gaussian. We estimate that
the `treatment' benefit rate in the population is 23.7% (95% Bayesian credible
interval: 2.6%, 53.7%) despite a harming average effect.

each user generates the transmit symbols by linearly encoding both its message
and the past received symbols (i.e., the feedback information) from the other
user. In Gaussian one-way channels (GOWCs), Butman has proposed a
well-developed model for linear encoding that encapsulates feedback information
into transmit signals. However, such a model for GTWCs has not been well
studied since the coupling of the encoding processes at the users in GTWCs
renders the encoding design non-trivial and challenging. In this paper, we aim
to fill this gap in the literature by extending the existing signal models in
GOWCs to GTWCs. With our developed signal model for GTWCs, we formulate an
optimization problem to jointly design the encoding/decoding schemes for both
the users, aiming to minimize the weighted sum of their transmit powers under
signal-to-noise ratio constraints. First, we derive an optimal form of the
linear decoding schemes under any arbitrary encoding schemes employed at the
users. Further, we provide new insights on the encoding design for GTWCs. In
particular, we show that it is optimal that one of the users (i) does not
transmit the feedback information to the other user at the last channel use,
and (ii) transmits its message only over the last channel use. With these
solution behaviors, we further simplify the problem and solve it via an
iterative two-way optimization scheme. We numerically demonstrate that our
proposed scheme for GTWCs achieves a better performance in terms of the
transmit power compared to the existing counterparts, such as the non-feedback
scheme and one-way optimization scheme.

sensitive low-frequency widefield surveys to date, allowing us to select
low-luminosity PS sources. Our sample increases the number of known PS sources
in our survey area by a factor 50. The 5GHz luminosity distribution of our PS
sample shows we sample the lowest luminosity PS sources to-date by nearly an
order of magnitude. Since high-frequency PS sources and compact steep-spectrum
sources are hypothesised to be the precursors to large radio galaxies, we
investigate whether this is also the case for our sample of low-frequency PS
sources. Using optical line emission criteria, we find that our PS sources are
predominately high-excitation radio galaxies instead of low-excitation radio
galaxies, corresponding to a quickly evolving population. We compute the radio
source counts of our PS sample, and find they are scaled down by a factor of
$\sim$40 compared to a general sample of radio-loud active galactic nuclei
(AGN). This implies that the lifetimes of PS sources are 40 times shorter than
large scale radio galaxies, if their luminosity functions are identical. To
investigate this, we compute the first radio luminosity function for a
homogeneously-selected PS sample. We find that for 144MHz luminosities $\gtrsim
10^{25}$W Hz$^{-1}$, the PS luminosity function has the same shape as an
unresolved radio-loud AGN population but shifted down by a factor of $\sim$10.
We interpret this as strong evidence that these high-luminosity PS sources
evolve into large-scale radio-loud AGN. For local, low-luminosity PS sources,
there is a surplus of PS sources, which we hypothesise to be the addition of
frustrated PS sources that do not evolve into large-scale AGN.

explicitly as an intermediate stage of the 3D detection network. Depth map
approaches yield more accurate depth to objects than other methods thanks to
the depth estimation network trained on a large-scale dataset. However, depth
map approaches can be limited by the accuracy of the depth map, and
sequentially using two separated networks for depth estimation and 3D detection
significantly increases computation cost and inference time. In this work, we
propose a method to boost the RGB image-based 3D detector by jointly training
the detection network with a depth prediction loss analogous to the depth
estimation task. In this way, our 3D detection network can be supervised by
more depth supervision from raw LiDAR points, which does not require any human
annotation cost, to estimate accurate depth without explicitly predicting the
depth map. Our novel object-centric depth prediction loss focuses on depth
around foreground objects, which is important for 3D object detection, to
leverage pixel-wise depth supervision in an object-centric manner. Our depth
regression model is further trained to predict the uncertainty of depth to
represent the 3D confidence of objects. To effectively train the 3D detector
with raw LiDAR points and to enable end-to-end training, we revisit the
regression target of 3D objects and design a network architecture. Extensive
experiments on KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks show that our method can
significantly boost the monocular image-based 3D detector to outperform depth
map approaches while maintaining the real-time inference speed.

continuous space for video-based generative tasks. INR-V parameterizes videos
using implicit neural representations (INRs), a multi-layered perceptron that
predicts an RGB value for each input pixel location of the video. The INR is
predicted using a meta-network which is a hypernetwork trained on neural
representations of multiple video instances. Later, the meta-network can be
sampled to generate diverse novel videos enabling many downstream video-based
generative tasks. Interestingly, we find that conditional regularization and
progressive weight initialization play a crucial role in obtaining INR-V. The
representation space learned by INR-V is more expressive than an image space
showcasing many interesting properties not possible with the existing works.
For instance, INR-V can smoothly interpolate intermediate videos between known
video instances (such as intermediate identities, expressions, and poses in
face videos). It can also in-paint missing portions in videos to recover
temporally coherent full videos. In this work, we evaluate the space learned by
INR-V on diverse generative tasks such as video interpolation, novel video

QKs alternative to the fidelity-based one. In this work, we propose a new class

the target response matrix with respect to the IRS, subject to the minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at the CUs and the
maximum transmit power constraint at the BS. We present efficient algorithms to
solve the highly non-convex SINR-constrained CRB minimization problems, by
using the techniques of alternating optimization and semi-definite relaxation.
Numerical results show that the proposed design achieves lower estimation CRB
than other benchmark schemes, and the sensing signal interference
pre-cancellation is beneficial when the number of CUs is greater than one.

This paper, therefore, discusses the non-diagonal elements of the stiffness
matrix. We proposed a design method according to the conditions required for
achieving stable motion. Additionally, we analyzed the displacement induced by
the non-diagonal elements in response to an external force and found that to
obtain stable contact with a symmetric matrix, the matrix should be positive
definite, i.e., all eigenvalues must be positive, however its parameter design
is complicated. In this study, we focused on the use of asymmetric matrices in
compliance control and showed that the design of eigenvalues can be simplified
by using a triangular matrix. This approach expands the range of the stiffness
design and enhances the ability of the compliance control to induce motion. We
conducted experiments using the stiffness matrix and confirmed that assembly
could be achieved without complicated trajectory planning.

approaches suffer from several drawbacks, including bottlenecks of the single
cloud server model, high computational overhead of operations, excessive trust
in cloud servers and roadside units (RSUs), and leakage of vehicle trajectory
privacy. In this paper, BEPHAP, a Blockchain-based Efficient Privacy-preserving
Handover Authentication Protocol with key agreement for internet of vehicles,
is introduced to address these problems. BEPHAP achieves anonymous cross-domain
mutual handover authentication with key agreement based on the tamper-proof
blockchain, symmetric cryptography, and the chameleon hash function under a
security model that cloud servers and RSUs may launch attacks. BEPHAP is
particularly well suited for IoV since it allows vehicles only need to perform
lightweight cryptographic operations during the authentication phase. BEPHAP
also achieves data confidentiality, unlinkability, traceability,
non-repudiation, non-frameability, and key escrow freeness. Formal verification
based on ProVerif and formal security proofs based on the BAN logic indicates
that BEPHAP is resistant to various typical attacks, such as man-in-the-middle
attacks, impersonation attacks, and replay attacks. Performance analysis
demonstrates that BEPHAP surpasses existing works in both computation and
communication efficiencies. And the message loss rate remains 0 at 5000
requests per second, which meets the requirement of IoV.

the conventional ``multi-channel Kondo effect'' or a topological mesoscopic
device (``topological Kondo effect'') -- has been proposed as a platform to
realize anyonic quasi-particles. However, the above implementations require
either perfect channel symmetry or the use of Majorana fermions. Here we
propose a Majorana-free mesoscopic setup which implements the Kondo effect of
the symplectic Lie group and can harbor emergent anyons (including Majorana
fermions, Fibonacci anyons, and $\mathbb Z_3$ parafermions) even in the absence
of perfect channel symmetry. In addition to the detailed prescription of the
implementation, we present the strong coupling solution by mapping the model to
the multi-channel Kondo effect associated to an internal $SU(2)$ symmetry and
exploit conformal field theory (CFT) to predict the non-trivial scaling of a
variety of observables, including conductance, as a function of temperature.
This work does not only open the door for robust Kondo-based anyon platforms,
but also sheds light on the physics of strongly correlated materials with
competing order parameters.

important in describing nanomaterials where atoms or molecules at the surface

the material because they have fewer bonds or interactions at the surface.
Using calorimetric methods, we show that the surface energy is negative in some
prototypical colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, or quantum dots with organic
ligand coatings. This implies that the surface atoms are more thermodynamically
stable than those on the interior due to the strong bonds between these atoms
and surfactant molecules, or ligands, that coat their surface. In addition, we
extend this work to core/shell indium phosphide/zinc sulfide nanocrystals and
show that the interfacial energy between these materials is highly
thermodynamically favorable in spite of their large lattice mismatch. This work
challenges many of the assumptions that have guided thinking about colloidal

multiple sparse rows of the weight matrix simultaneously with vector processing
units. As a result, LearningGroup system minimizes the cycle time and memory
footprint for sparse data generation up to 5.72x and 6.81x. Its FPGA

using the Arecibo and Green Bank radio telescopes. The interplanetary
scintillation (IPS) technique was used to probe the plasma tail at P-band
(302--352 MHz), 820 MHz, and L-band (1120--1730 MHz). The presence and absence
of scintillation at different perpendicular distances from the central axis of
the plasma tail suggests a narrow tail of less than 6~arcmin at a distance of
$\sim$10~arcmin ($\sim$$10^6$~km) from the comet nucleus. Data recorded during
the occultation of B1019+083 on 31 October 2019 with the Arecibo Telescope
covered the width of the plasma tail from its outer region to the central axis.
The systematic increase in scintillation during the occultation provides the
plasma properties associated with the tail when the comet was at its
pre-perihelion phase. The excess level of L-band scintillation indicates a
plasma density enhancement of $\sim$15--20 times that of the background solar
wind. The evolving shape of the observed scintillation power spectra across the
tail from its edge to the central axis suggests a density spectrum flatter than
Kolmogorov, and that the plasma-density irregularity scales present in the tail
range between 10 and 700 km. The discovery of a high-frequency spectral excess,
corresponding to irregularity scales much smaller than the Fresnel scale,
suggests the presence of small-scale density structures in the plasma tail,
likely caused by interaction between the solar wind and the plasma environment

  Classification with Imbalanced Sensor Data based on Generative Adversarial
  Network",,,,,"cs.LG stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Supervised classification methods have been widely utilized for the quality
assurance of the advanced manufacturing process, such as additive manufacturing
(AM) for anomaly (defects) detection. However, since abnormal states (with
defects) occur much less frequently than normal ones (without defects) in a
manufacturing process, the number of sensor data samples collected from a
normal state is usually much more than that from an abnormal state. This issue
causes imbalanced training data for classification analysis, thus deteriorating
the performance of detecting abnormal states in the process. It is beneficial
to generate effective artificial sample data for the abnormal states to make a
more balanced training set. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a novel
data augmentation method based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) using
additive manufacturing process image sensor data. The novelty of our approach
is that a standard GAN and classifier are jointly optimized with techniques to
stabilize the learning process of standard GAN. The diverse and high-quality
generated samples provide balanced training data to the classifier. The
iterative optimization between GAN and classifier provides the high-performance
classifier. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by both
open-source data and real-world case studies in polymer and metal AM processes.

the effect of plasma and dark matter mediums on the weak deflection angle. We
show that increasing the impact of these two mediums grows the deflection
angle. We also calculate the Hawking temperature via Gauss-Bonnet theorem. In
addition, we determine the fermionic greybody bounds. Moreover, we discuss the
graphical behaviour of the deflection angle and bounds on the greybody factor.
Graphically, we observe that taking $0 < A_{\lambda} < 1$ angle ranges from
negative values to maximum values and also attain maximum value for these
values of $ A_{\lambda}$ and for $A_{\lambda} \geq 1$ exponentially approaches
to zero. Later, we graphically investigate that the greybody factor bound
exhibits the convergent behaviour by converging to $1$. We also examine that
the results obtained for the black hole in effective loop quantum gravity are
reduced to the Schwarzschild black hole solutions when the dimensionless
non-negative parameter is equal to zero $A_{\lambda}=0$.

are now established methods to characterize human behaviors in HRI scenarios

specific interaction scenarios, and further, how good is their robustness
towards environmental changes? These questions are important to address if the
HRI field wishes to put social robotic companions into real environments acting
consistently, i.e. changing lighting conditions or moving people should still
produce the same recognition results. In this paper, we study the impact of
different image conditions on the recognition of arousal and valence from human
facial expressions using the FaceChannel framework \cite{Barro20}. Our results
show how the interpretation of human affective states can differ greatly in
either the positive or negative direction even when changing only slightly the

  Rules for Classification",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  An important constraint of Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) is their structured
rules defined based on evaluating all input variables. Indeed, the length of
all fuzzy rules and the number of input variables are equal. However, in many
decision-making problems evaluating some conditions on a limited set of input
variables is sufficient to decide properly (unstructured rules). Therefore,
this constraint limits the performance, generalization, and interpretability of
the FIS. To address this issue, this paper presents a neuro-fuzzy inference
system for classification applications that can select different sets of input
variables for constructing each fuzzy rule. To realize this capability, a new
fuzzy selector neuron with an adaptive parameter is proposed that can select
input variables in the antecedent part of each fuzzy rule. Moreover, in this
paper, the consequent part of the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang FIS is also changed
properly to consider only the selected set of input variables. To learn the
parameters of the proposed architecture, a trust-region-based learning method
(General quasi-Levenberg-Marquardt (GqLM)) is proposed to minimize
cross-entropy in multiclass problems. The performance of the proposed method is
compared with some related previous approaches in some real-world
classification problems. Based on these comparisons the proposed method has
better or very close performance with a parsimonious structure consisting of
unstructured fuzzy.

opportunities for on-demand service provisioning anywhere and anytime, but also
exposes UAVs to a variety of cyber threats. Low/medium interaction honeypots
offer a promising lightweight defense for actively protecting mobile Internet
of things, particularly UAV networks. While previous research has primarily
focused on honeypot system design and attack pattern recognition, the incentive
issue for motivating UAV's participation (e.g., sharing trapped attack data in
honeypots) to collaboratively resist distributed and sophisticated attacks
remains unexplored. This paper proposes a novel game-theoretical collaborative
defense approach to address optimal, fair, and feasible incentive design, in
the presence of network dynamics and UAVs' multi-dimensional private
information (e.g., valid defense data (VDD) volume, communication delay, and
UAV cost). Specifically, we first develop a honeypot game between UAVs and the
network operator under both partial and complete information asymmetry
scenarios. The optimal VDD-reward contract design problem with partial
information asymmetry is then solved using a contract-theoretic approach that
ensures budget feasibility, truthfulness, fairness, and computational
efficiency. In addition, under complete information asymmetry, we devise a
distributed reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically design optimal
contracts for distinct types of UAVs in the time-varying UAV network. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can motivate UAV's cooperation
in VDD sharing and improve defensive effectiveness, compared with conventional
schemes.

well-powered study to evaluate MDS for topic modeling fully. Namely, improving
cluster cohesion, improving the factuality and faithfulness of MDS, and
increasing the number of documents that might be supported by MDS. We present a
number of ideas on how these can be tackled and conclude with some thoughts on

However, many different claims come under that label in the literature, and it
can often be confusing what an appeal to ""black hole complementarity"" is meant
to do. Unpacking this literature, I argue that black hole complementarity is
about the consistency of quantum characterizations of an evaporating black
hole. To bring this into focus, I delineate two consistency claims -- i.e., two
principles of black hole complementarity: operational complementarity and
descriptive complementarity. These two principles are more or less attractive
depending on one's background philosophy of science. Instrumentalists will lean
towards operational complementarity while scientific realists will lean towards
descriptive complementarity. If one resists instrumentalism (as many do, for
good reason), one has a prima facie reason to adopt the descriptive principle
and reject the operational principle. However, a series of thought experiments
in the physics literature on black hole complementarity gives us strong reasons
to adopt the operational principle and reject the descriptive principle. This
shows that if we can stomach instrumentalism, then operational complementarity
may suffice to resolve the black hole information paradox.
