hierarchy below the first measurable cardinal. Namely, we give two different
characterizations of strongly unfoldable and subtle cardinals in terms of a
weak form of the principle of Structural Reflection, and also in terms of weak
product structural reflection. Our analysis prompts the introduction of the new
notion of $C^{(n)}$-strongly unfoldable cardinal for every natural number $n$,
and we show that these cardinals form a natural hierarchy between strong
unfoldable and subtle cardinals analogous to the known hierarchies of
$C^{(n)}$-extendible and $\Sigma_n$-strong cardinals. These results show that
the relatively low region of the large-cardinal hierarchy comprised between the
first strongly unfoldable and the first subtle cardinals is completely
analogous to the much higher region between the first strong and the first
Woodin cardinals, and also to the much further upper region of the hierarchy
ranging between the first supercompact and the first Vop\v{e}nka cardinals.

image nor the blur kernel is known. Even though considerable progress has been
made, several major difficulties remain for blind deblurring, including the
trade-off between high-performance deblurring and real-time processing.
Besides, we observe that current single image blind deblurring networks cannot
further improve or stabilize the performance but significantly degrades the
performance when re-deblurring is repeatedly applied. This implies the
limitation of these networks in modeling an ideal deblurring process. In this
work, we make two contributions to tackle the above difficulties: (1) We
introduce the idempotent constraint into the deblurring framework and present a
deep idempotent network to achieve improved blind non-uniform deblurring
performance with stable re-deblurring. (2) We propose a simple yet efficient
deblurring network with lightweight encoder-decoder units and a recurrent
structure that can deblur images in a progressive residual fashion. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets prove the superiority of our
proposed framework. Remarkably, our proposed network is nearly 6.5X smaller and
6.4X faster than the state-of-the-art while achieving comparable high

economic incentives for short-term reductions of transmission capacities on
existing interconnectors by the responsible transmission system operators
(TSOs). We show that if a TSO aims to maximize domestic total welfare, it often
has an incentive to reduce the capacity on the interconnectors to neighboring
countries.
  In contrast with the (limited) literature on this subject, which focuses on
incentives through the avoidance of future balancing costs, we show that
incentives can exist even if one ignores balancing and focuses solely on
welfare gains in the day-ahead market itself. Our analysis consists of two
parts. In the first part, we develop an analytical framework that explains why
these incentives exist. In particular, we distinguish two mechanisms: one based
on price differences with neighboring countries and one based on the domestic
electricity price. In the second part, we perform numerical experiments using a
model of the Northern-European power system, focusing on the Danish TSO. In 97%
of the historical hours tested, we indeed observe economic incentives for
capacity reductions, leading to significant welfare gains for Denmark and
welfare losses for the system as a whole. We show that the potential for
welfare gains greatly depends on the ability of the TSO to adapt interconnector
capacities to short-term market conditions. Finally, we explore the extent to
which the recently introduced European ""70%-rule"" can mitigate the incentives
for capacity reductions and their welfare effects.

identical but arbitrary spin. This is possible because the theory admits a

introduce interesting search channels of immediate impact for the ATLAS and CMS

particles with either invisible or long-lived particles. We further show how to
adapt earlier SUSY-motivated searchers of new physics to constrain the spectrum

prediction. Empirically, low-resolution feature maps often achieve stronger
semantic representation, and high-resolution feature maps generally can better
identify local features such as edges, but contains weaker semantic
information. Existing state-of-the-art frameworks such as HRNet has kept
low-resolution and high-resolution feature maps in parallel, and repeatedly
exchange the information across different resolutions. However, we believe that
the lowest-resolution feature map often contains the strongest semantic
information, and it is necessary to go through more layers to merge with
high-resolution feature maps, while for high-resolution feature maps, the
computational cost of each convolutional layer is very large, and there is no
need to go through so many layers. Therefore, we designed a U-shaped
High-Resolution Network (U-HRNet), which adds more stages after the feature map
with strongest semantic representation and relaxes the constraint in HRNet that
all resolutions need to be calculated parallel for a newly added stage. More
calculations are allocated to low-resolution feature maps, which significantly
improves the overall semantic representation. U-HRNet is a substitute for the
HRNet backbone and can achieve significant improvement on multiple semantic
segmentation and depth prediction datasets, under the exactly same training and
inference setting, with almost no increasing in the amount of calculation. Code

for each SB1 previously constrained, we applied Fourier spectral disentangling
to multi-epoch optical VLT/FLAMES spectra of each target to extract a potential

spectroscopic binaries (SB2s). For targets where the disentangling does not
reveal any signature of a stellar companion, we performed atmospheric and
evolutionary modelling on the primary to obtain constraints on the unseen
companion. Seven newly classified SB2 systems with mass ratios down to near 0.1
were identified. From the remaining targets, for which no faint companion could
be extracted from the spectra, four are found to have companion masses in the
predicted mass ranges of neutron stars (NSes) and BHes. Two of these have
companion masses between 1 and 3.5 $M_{\odot}$, making them potential hosts of
NSes (or lower mass main sequence stars). The other two are between 2.5 to 8

Previous methods focus on learning point weights to fit neighborhoods into a
geometric surface approximated by a polynomial function with a predefined
order, based on which normals are estimated. However, fitting surfaces
explicitly from raw point clouds suffers from overfitting or underfitting
issues caused by inappropriate polynomial orders and outliers, which
significantly limits the performance of existing methods. To address these
issues, we introduce hyper surface fitting to implicitly learn hyper surfaces,
which are represented by multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers that take point
features as input and output surface patterns in a high dimensional feature
space. We introduce a novel space transformation module, which consists of a
sequence of local aggregation layers and global shift layers, to learn an
optimal feature space, and a relative position encoding module to effectively
convert point clouds into the learned feature space. Our model learns hyper
surfaces from the noise-less features and directly predicts normal vectors. We
jointly optimize the MLP weights and module parameters in a data-driven manner
to make the model adaptively find the most suitable surface pattern for various
points. Experimental results show that our HSurf-Net achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on the synthetic shape dataset, the real-world

100 AU at times that differ by as much as 120 (d/100 Mpc)^{-1} nanoseconds
because of the curvature of the wavefront. At gigahertz frequencies, the
arrival time difference can be determined to better than a nanosecond with
interferometry. If the space-time positions of the detectors are known to a few
centimeters, comparable to the accuracy to which very long baseline
interferometry baselines and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)
geolocations are constrained, nanosecond timing would allow competitive
cosmological constraints. We show that a four-detector constellation at Solar
radii of >10 AU could measure distances to individual sources with sub-percent
precision and, hence, cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant to
this precision. The precision increases quadratically with baseline length.
FRBs are the only known bright extragalactic radio source that are sufficiently
point-like. Galactic scattering limits the timing precision at <3 GHz, whereas
at higher frequencies the precision is set by removing dispersion. Furthermore,
for baselines greater than 100 AU, Shapiro time delays limit the precision, but
their effect can be cleaned with two additional detectors. Accelerations that
result in ~1 cm uncertainty in detector positions (from variations in the Sun's
irradiance, dust collisions and gaseous drag) could be corrected for with
weekly GNSS-like trilaterations. Gravitational accelerations from asteroids
occur over longer timescales, and so a setup with a precise accelerometer and
calibrating the detector positions off of distant FRBs may also be sufficient.
The proposed interferometer would also resolve the radio emission region of
Galactic pulsars, constrain the mass distribution in the outer Solar System,
and reach interesting sensitivities to ~0.01-100 micro-Hz gravitational waves.

challenging to apply higher dimensional functions (>20-dimensional function) to
approximate predictions with the GP. Furthermore, noisy data or data containing
erroneous observations and outliers are major challenges for advanced ATF
concepts. Also, the governing differential equation is empirical for
longer-term ATF candidates, and data availability is an issue. Physics-informed
multi-fidelity Kriging (MFK) can be useful for identifying and predicting the

conductivity measurement data for ATF. The MFK method showed its significance
for a small number of data that could not be modeled by the conventional
Kriging method. Mathematical models constructed with this method can be easily
connected to later-stage analysis such as uncertainty quantification and
sensitivity analysis and are expected to be applied to fundamental research and
a wide range of product development fields. The overarching objective of this
chapter is to show the capability of MFK surrogates that can be embedded in a
digital twin system for ATF.

of the Deffuant model of opinion formation. These equations can describe both
fully-mixed populations and the case where individuals interact only along
edges of a network. In each case, interactions only occur between individuals
whose opinions differ by less than a given parameter, called the confidence
bound. The size of the confidence bound parameter is known to strongly affect
both the dynamics and the number and location of opinion clusters. In this work
we carry out a mathematical analysis of the mean-field equations to investigate
the role of the confidence bound and boundaries on these important observables
of the model. We consider the limit in which the confidence bound interval is
small, and identify the key mechanisms driving opinion evolution. We show that
linear stability analysis can predict the number and location of opinion
clusters. Comparison with numerical simulations of the model illustrates that
the early-time dynamics and the final cluster locations can be accurately
approximated for networks composed of two degree classes, as well as for the

luminosity is estimated to be 4.2$\times$10$^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The quiescent
corona of SZ Psc was observed $\sim$5.67 d after the flare using Swift

(FIP) elements are more abundant than the low-FIP elements. The time-resolved
X-ray spectroscopy of the flare shows a significant variation in the flare
temperature, emission measure, and abundance. The peak values of temperature,
emission measure, and abundances during the flare are estimated to be
199$\pm$11 MK, 2.13$\pm$0.05 $\times 10^{56}$ cm$^{-3}$, 0.66$\pm$0.09

loop length of the flare as 6.3$\pm$0.5 $\times 10^{11}$ cm, whereas the loop
pressure and density at the flare peak are derived to be 3.5$\pm$0.7 $\times
10^{3}$ dyne cm$^{-2}$ and 8$\pm$2 $\times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively.
The total magnetic field to produce the flare is estimated to be 490$\pm$60 G.
The large magnetic field at the coronal height is supposed to be due to the
presence of an extended convection zone of the sub-giant and the high orbital

latency, and power consumption of deep learning models. However, existing
quantization methods suffer from accuracy degradation compared to
full-precision (FP) models due to the errors introduced by coarse gradient
estimation through non-differentiable quantization layers. The existence of
sharp local minima in the loss landscapes of overparameterized models (e.g.,
Transformers) tends to aggravate such performance penalty in low-bit (2, 4
bits) settings. In this work, we propose sharpness- and quantization-aware
training (SQuAT), which would encourage the model to converge to flatter minima
while performing quantization-aware training. Our proposed method alternates
training between sharpness objective and step-size objective, which could
potentially let the model learn the most suitable parameter update magnitude to
reach convergence near-flat minima. Extensive experiments show that our method
can consistently outperform state-of-the-art quantized BERT models under 2, 3,

depth for a photon with energy $E_\gamma=18$ TeV varies between 9.4 and 27.1
according to existing models of the extra-galactic background light (EBL) in
the relevant mid infra-red range. The resulting suppression of the flux in
several (but not all) EBL models makes it for these EBL models unlikely that
this photon could have been observed at the claimed energy. If the photon event
and its energy are confirmed and possibly even more photons above 10 TeV have
been observed, the photon-pair production process would have to be suppressed
by mechanisms predicted in extensions of the Standard Model of particle
physics. We consider the possibilities of photon mixing with a light
pseudo-scalar (e.g., axion-like particles; ALPs) in the magnetic field of the
host galaxy and the Milky Way and Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). In the
case of photon-ALP mixing, the boost factor would reach values $\sim10^6$ for
photon couplings not ruled out by the CAST experiment, but limited by other
astrophysical constraints. Viable scenarios would require either very efficient
mixing in or near to the GRB or that the largest part of the total luminosity
is radiated at TeV energies, different from previous GRB afterglows. In the
case of LIV, required boost factors are achievable for a LIV breaking energy
scale $\lesssim 2\times 10^{29}$~eV ($\lesssim 4\times 10^{21}$~eV) for the
linear (quadratic) modification of the dispersion relation. A more simple
explanation would be a misidentification of a charged cosmic-ray air shower.

two different models of anti-resonances with the same period. As a function of

procedure -- computing similarity between the query image and the embedded
words for each category. By only using the category name, they neglect to make
use of the rich context of additional information that language affords. The
procedure gives no intermediate understanding of why a category is chosen, and
furthermore provides no mechanism for adjusting the criteria used towards this
decision. We present an alternative framework for classification with VLMs,
which we call classification by description. We ask VLMs to check for
descriptive features rather than broad categories: to find a tiger, look for
its stripes; its claws; and more. By basing decisions on these descriptors, we
can provide additional cues that encourage using the features we want to be
used. In the process, we can get a clear idea of what features the model uses
to construct its decision; it gains some level of inherent explainability. We
query large language models (e.g., GPT-3) for these descriptors to obtain them

of social media. Even though the virtual environment makes interaction possible
regardless of physical location, many of the most pressing issues during the
pandemic -- case counts, lockdown policies, vaccine availability -- have played
out in an intensely local fashion. Reflecting this locality, many of the online
COVID communities that formed have been closely tied to physical location, at
different spatial scales ranging from cities to countries to entire global
platforms. This provides an opportunity to study how the real-world geography
of the pandemic translates into a virtual landscape. By analyzing almost 300
geographically-linked COVID discussion communities on Reddit, we show how these
discussions were organized geographically and temporally in three aspects: what
were people talking about, who were they talking about it with, and how did
they self-organize these conversations?

interest among researchers to curate a unified set of guidelines suitable for
annotators with various backgrounds. In this work, we develop a
crowdsourcing-friendly coreference annotation methodology, ezCoref, consisting
of an annotation tool and an interactive tutorial. We use ezCoref to
re-annotate 240 passages from seven existing English coreference datasets
(spanning fiction, news, and multiple other domains) while teaching annotators
only cases that are treated similarly across these datasets. Surprisingly, we
find that reasonable quality annotations were already achievable (>90%
agreement between the crowd and expert annotations) even without extensive
training. On carefully analyzing the remaining disagreements, we identify the
presence of linguistic cases that our annotators unanimously agree upon but
lack unified treatments (e.g., generic pronouns, appositives) in existing
datasets. We propose the research community should revisit these phenomena when
curating future unified annotation guidelines.

of finite energy and boundary. There are several essential difficulties in
proving finite time blowup of the 3D Euler equations with smooth initial data.
One of the essential difficulties is to control a number of nonlocal terms that
do not seem to offer any damping effect. Another essential difficulty is that
the strong advection normal to the boundary introduces a large growth factor
for the perturbation if we use weighted $L^2$ or $H^k$ estimates. We overcome
this difficulty by using a combination of a weighted $L^\infty$ norm and a
weighted $C^{1/2}$ norm, and develop sharp functional inequalities using the
symmetry properties of the kernels and some techniques from optimal transport.
Moreover we decompose the linearized operator into a leading order operator
plus a finite rank operator. The leading order operator is designed in such a
way that we can obtain sharp stability estimates. The contribution from the
finite rank operator to linear stability can be estimated by constructing
approximate solutions in space-time. This enables us to establish nonlinear
stability of the approximate self-similar profile and prove stable nearly
self-similar blowup of the 2D Boussinesq and 3D Euler equations with smooth

Thus a sumset significantly larger than the Cauchy--Davenport bound can be

Natural Language Generation (NLG), i.e., evaluating the generated text from

automatic evaluation in NLG is still dominated by similarity-based metrics, and
we lack a reliable framework for a more comprehensive evaluation of advanced
models. In this paper, we propose a unified multi-dimensional evaluator UniEval

evaluate from multiple dimensions. Furthermore, thanks to the unified Boolean
QA format, we are able to introduce an intermediate learning phase that enables
UniEval to incorporate external knowledge from multiple related tasks and gain
further improvement. Experiments on three typical NLG tasks show that UniEval
correlates substantially better with human judgments than existing metrics.
Specifically, compared to the top-performing unified evaluators, UniEval
achieves a 23% higher correlation on text summarization, and over 43% on
dialogue response generation. Also, UniEval demonstrates a strong zero-shot

  Reasoning with Deep Reinforcement Learning","Camera ready. NeurIPS 2022",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The automation of the medical evidence acquisition and diagnosis process has
recently attracted increasing attention in order to reduce the workload of
doctors and democratize access to medical care. However, most works proposed in
the machine learning literature focus solely on improving the prediction
accuracy of a patient's pathology. We argue that this objective is insufficient
to ensure doctors' acceptability of such systems. In their initial interaction
with patients, doctors do not only focus on identifying the pathology a patient
is suffering from; they instead generate a differential diagnosis (in the form
of a short list of plausible diseases) because the medical evidence collected
from patients is often insufficient to establish a final diagnosis. Moreover,
doctors explicitly explore severe pathologies before potentially ruling them
out from the differential, especially in acute care settings. Finally, for
doctors to trust a system's recommendations, they need to understand how the
gathered evidences led to the predicted diseases. In particular, interactions
between a system and a patient need to emulate the reasoning of doctors. We
therefore propose to model the evidence acquisition and automatic diagnosis
tasks using a deep reinforcement learning framework that considers three
essential aspects of a doctor's reasoning, namely generating a differential
diagnosis using an exploration-confirmation approach while prioritizing severe
pathologies. We propose metrics for evaluating interaction quality based on
these three aspects. We show that our approach performs better than existing
models while maintaining competitive pathology prediction accuracy.

  discontinuous Galerkin method for the Vlasov dynamics","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2207.00518",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we propose a novel Local Macroscopic Conservative (LoMaC) low
rank tensor method with discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization for the
physical and phase spaces for simulating the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) system. The
LoMaC property refers to the exact local conservation of macroscopic mass,
momentum and energy at the discrete level. The recently developed LoMaC low
rank tensor algorithm (arXiv:2207.00518) simultaneously evolves the macroscopic
conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy using the kinetic flux vector
splitting; then the LoMaC property is realized by projecting the low rank
kinetic solution onto a subspace that shares the same macroscopic observables.
  This paper is a generalization of our previous work, but with DG
discretization to take advantage of its compactness and flexibility in handling
boundary conditions and its superior accuracy in the long term. The algorithm
is developed in a similar fashion as that for a finite difference scheme, by
observing that the DG method can be viewed equivalently in a nodal fashion.
With the nodal DG method, assuming a tensorized computational grid, one will be
able to (1) derive differentiation matrices for different nodal points based on
a DG upwind discretization of transport terms, and (2) define a weighted inner
product space based on the nodal DG grid points. The algorithm can be extended
to the high dimensional problems by hierarchical Tucker decomposition of
solution tensors and a corresponding conservative projection algorithm. In a
similar spirit, the algorithm can be extended to DG methods on nodal points of
an unstructured mesh, or to other types of discretization, e.g. the spectral
method in velocity direction. Extensive numerical results are performed to
showcase the efficacy of the method.

identifying a molecule or set of molecules that balance multiple, often
competing, properties. Multi-objective molecular design is commonly addressed
by combining properties of interest into a single objective function using
scalarization, which imposes assumptions about relative importance and uncovers
little about the trade-offs between objectives. In contrast to scalarization,
Pareto optimization does not require knowledge of relative importance and
reveals the trade-offs between objectives. However, it introduces additional
considerations in algorithm design. In this review, we describe pool-based and
de novo generative approaches to multi-objective molecular discovery with a
focus on Pareto optimization algorithms. We show how pool-based molecular
discovery is a relatively direct extension of multi-objective Bayesian
optimization and how the plethora of different generative models extend from
single-objective to multi-objective optimization in similar ways using
non-dominated sorting in the reward function (reinforcement learning) or to
select molecules for retraining (distribution learning) or propagation (genetic
algorithms). Finally, we discuss some remaining challenges and opportunities in
the field, emphasizing the opportunity to adopt Bayesian optimization
techniques into multi-objective de novo design.

electron-electron interaction operator onto the chosen predefined states,
reintroduces the projected operator into the noninteracting Kohn-Sham reference
system, and introduces a density functional approximation for the remaining
electron-electron interactions. Projected hybrids are readily implemented
existing density functional codes, requiring only a projection of the
one-electron density matrices and exchange operators entering existing
routines. This work also presents a first application: a core-projected
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof hybrid PBE0c70, in which the fraction of nonlocal exact
exchange is increased from 25% to 70% in core AOs. Automatic selection of the
projected AOs provides a black-box model chemistry appropriate for both core

accurately recover core-electron binding energies of second- and third-row

expansion techniques. We also analyze the dual-RBIM, that is the model that in
the absence of disorder is related to the RBIM via the Kramers-Wannier duality.
Even on self-dual lattices this model is different from the RBIM, unlike in the
euclidean case. We explain this anomaly by a careful re-derivation of the
Kramers--Wannier duality. For the (dual-)RBIM, we compute the
paramagnet-to-ferromagnet phase transition as a function of both temperature
$T$ and the fraction of antiferromagnetic bonds $p$. We find that as
temperature is decreased in the RBIM, the paramagnet gives way to either a
ferromagnet or a spin-glass phase via a second-order transition compatible with
mean-field behavior. In contrast, the dual-RBIM undergoes a strongly first
order transition from the paramagnet to the ferromagnet both in the absence of
disorder and along the Nishimori line. We study both transitions for a variety
of hyperbolic tessellations and comment on the role of coordination number and
curvature. The extent of the ferromagnetic phase in the dual-RBIM corresponds
to the correctable phase of hyperbolic surface codes under independent bit- and
phase-flip noise.

decoding algorithm. However, the general principles that should guide the
choice of a decoding algorithm remain unclear. Previous works only compare
decoding algorithms in narrow scenarios, and their findings do not generalize
across tasks. We argue that the misalignment between the model's likelihood and
the task-specific notion of utility is the key factor to understanding the
effectiveness of decoding algorithms. To structure the discussion, we introduce
a taxonomy of misalignment mitigation strategies (MMSs), providing a unifying
view of decoding as a tool for alignment. The MMS taxonomy groups decoding
algorithms based on their implicit assumptions about likelihood--utility
misalignment, yielding general statements about their applicability across
tasks. Specifically, by analyzing the correlation between the likelihood and
the utility of predictions across a diverse set of tasks, we provide empirical
evidence supporting the proposed taxonomy and a set of principles to structure
reasoning when choosing a decoding algorithm. Crucially, our analysis is the
first to relate likelihood-based decoding algorithms with algorithms that rely
on external information, such as value-guided methods and prompting, and covers
the most diverse set of tasks to date. Code, data, and models are available at

  observations of late-type galaxies","13 pages, 7 figures",,,,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rotation curves are the key observational manifestation of the dark matter
distribution around late-type galaxies. In a halo model context, the precision
of constraints on halo parameters is a complex function of the properties of
the measurements as well as properties of the galaxy itself. Forthcoming
surveys will resolve rotation curves to varying degrees of precision, or
measure their integrated effect in the HI linewidth. To ascertain the relative
significance of the relevant quantities for constraining halo properties, we
study the information on halo mass and concentration as quantified by the
Kullback-Leibler divergence of the kinematics-informed posterior from the
uninformative prior. We calculate this divergence as a function of the
different types of spectroscopic observation, properties of the measurement,
galaxy properties and auxiliary observational data on the baryonic components.
Using the SPARC sample, we find that fits to the full rotation curve exhibit a
large variation in information gain between galaxies, ranging from 1 to 11
bits. This range is equivalent to the difference between the prior shrinking to
a flat posterior that is only a factor of 2 smaller compared to a factor of
2000 smaller. It is predominantly caused by the vast differences in the number
of data points and the size of velocity uncertainties between the SPARC
galaxies. Out of the galaxy properties, only the degree of dark matter
dominance is important. We also study the relative importance of the minimum HI
surface density probed and the size of velocity uncertainties on the
constraining power on the inner halo slope, finding the latter to be
significantly more important. We spell out the implications of these results
for optimising the strategy of galaxy surveys aiming to constrain galaxies'
dark matter distributions, highlighting spectroscopic precision as the most
important factor.

matter -nucleon recoil spectra from dark matter recoiling on the liquid xenon
detector target. In this paper, we present an approximate likelihood for the
XENON1T 1 tonne-year nuclear recoil search applicable to any nuclear recoil
spectrum. Alongside this paper, we publish data and code to compute upper
limits using the method we present. The approximate likelihood is constructed
in bins of reconstructed energy, profiled along the signal expectation in each
bin. This approach can be used to compute an approximate likelihood and
therefore most statistical results for any nuclear recoil spectrum. Computing
approximate results with this method is approximately three orders of magnitude
faster than the likelihood used in the original publications of XENON1T, where
limits were set for specific families of recoil spectra. Using this same
method, we include toy Monte Carlo simulation-derived binwise likelihoods for
the upcoming XENONnT experiment that can similarly be used to assess the
sensitivity to arbitrary nuclear recoil signatures in its eventual 20

characteristics. The users with similar APPs installed might share several
common interests and behave similarly in some scenarios. In this work, we learn
a user embedding vector based on each user's APP-installation information.
Since the user APP-installation embedding is learnable without dependency on
the historical intra-APP behavioral data of the user, it complements the
intra-APP embedding learned within each specific APP. Thus, they considerably
help improve the effectiveness of the personalized advertising in each APP, and
they are particularly beneficial for the cold start of the new users in the
APP. In this paper, we formulate the APP-installation user embedding learning
into a bipartite graph embedding problem. The main challenge in learning an
effective APP-installation user embedding is the imbalanced data distribution.
In this case, graph learning tends to be dominated by the popular APPs, which
billions of users have installed. In other words, some niche/specialized APPs
might have a marginal influence on graph learning. To effectively exploit the
valuable information from the niche APPs, we decompose the APP-installation
graph into a set of subgraphs. Each subgraph contains only one APP node and the
users who install the APP. For each mini-batch, we only sample the users from
the same subgraph in the training process. Thus, each APP can be involved in
the training process in a more balanced manner. After integrating the learned
APP-installation user embedding into our online personal advertising platform,
we obtained a considerable boost in CTR, CVR, and revenue.

logarithmic in what is required for $\textsf{BPP}$. Finally, for a quantum

piecewise linear (CPWL) function and vice versa. Recent results in the
literature estimated that the number of neurons needed to exactly represent any
CPWL function grows exponentially with the number of pieces or exponentially in
terms of the factorial of the number of distinct linear components. Moreover,
such growth is amplified linearly with the input dimension. These existing
results seem to indicate that the cost of representing a CPWL function is
expensive. In this paper, we propose much tighter bounds and establish a
polynomial time algorithm to find a network satisfying these bounds for any
given CPWL function. We prove that the number of hidden neurons required to
exactly represent any CPWL function is at most a quadratic function of the
number of pieces. In contrast to all previous results, this upper bound is
invariant to the input dimension. Besides the number of pieces, we also study
the number of distinct linear components in CPWL functions. When such a number
is also given, we prove that the quadratic complexity turns into bilinear,
which implies a lower neural complexity because the number of distinct linear
components is always not greater than the minimum number of pieces in a CPWL
function. When the number of pieces is unknown, we prove that, in terms of the
number of distinct linear components, the neural complexities of any CPWL
function are at most polynomial growth for low-dimensional inputs and factorial
growth for the worst-case scenario, which are significantly better than
existing results in the literature.

CFO. The system performance is evaluated via simulation. The bit error rate

performance measures. The performance is evaluated for different types of
modulation over different channel conditions. In this thesis, a dual bandwidth
for CFO tracking based on type-2 control loop to reduce the acquisition time of
PLL is proposed. It is proved that the proposed scheme is significantly faster

Each pathogen has emphasized the value of rapid and scalable vaccine
development programs. The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has made the importance
of such efforts especially clear. New biotechnological advances in vaccinology
allow for recent advances that provide only the nucleic acid building blocks of
an antigen, eliminating many safety concerns. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
these DNA and RNA vaccines have facilitated the development and deployment of
vaccines at an unprecedented pace. This success was attributable at least in
part to broader shifts in scientific research relative to prior epidemics; the
genome of SARS-CoV-2 was available as early as January 2020, facilitating
global efforts in the development of DNA and RNA vaccines within two weeks of
the international community becoming aware of the new viral threat.
Additionally, these technologies that were previously only theoretical are not
only safe but also highly efficacious. Although historically a slow process,
the rapid development of vaccines during the COVID-19 crisis reveals a major
shift in vaccine technologies. Here, we provide historical context for the
emergence of these paradigm-shifting vaccines. We describe several DNA and RNA
vaccines and in terms of their efficacy, safety, and approval status. We also
discuss patterns in worldwide distribution. The advances made since early 2020
provide an exceptional illustration of how rapidly vaccine development
technology has advanced in the last two decades in particular and suggest a new
era in vaccines against emerging pathogens.

radius, respectively, i.e. the halo mass function (HMF) and void size function
(VSF), it is possible to achieve fundamental constraints on the cosmological
model. While the HMF has already been extensively exploited providing robust
constraints on the main cosmological model parameters (e.g. $\Omega_{\rm m}$,
$\sigma_8$ and $S_8$), the VSF is still emerging as a viable and effective
cosmological probe. Given the expected complementarity of these statistics, in
this work we aim at estimating the costraining power deriving from their
combination. To this end, we exploit realistic mock samples of galaxy clusters
and voids extracted from state-of-the-art large hydrodynamical simulations, in
the redshift range $0.2 \leq z \leq 1$. We perform an accurate calibration of
the free parameters of the HMF and VSF models, needed to take into account the
differences between the types of mass tracers used in this work and those
considered in previous literature analyses. Then, we obtain constraints on
$\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ by performing a Bayesian analysis. We find that
cluster and void counts represent powerful independent and complementary probes

the HMF on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ improves drastically with the VSF

consistently yielded halo masses close to $10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$ for the

from the pair's kinematics via the `timing argument' have yielded a combined
mass of around $5 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$. Here, we analyse the
extremely large Uchuu simulation to constrain the mass of the Local Group and
its two most massive members. First, we demonstrate the importance of selecting
LG analogues whose kinematics are dominated by mutual interactions to a similar
extent as the LG. Adopting the observed separation and radial velocity, we
obtain a weighted posterior of $75_{-40}^{+65}$ kms$^{-1}$ for the uncertain
transverse velocity. Via Gaussian process regression, we infer a total mass of
$3.2^{+1.2}_{-0.9} \times 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$, significantly below the
timing argument prediction. Importantly, we show that the remaining uncertainty
is not rooted in the analysis or observational errors, but in the irreducible
scatter in the kinematics-mass relation. We further find a mass for the less
massive halo of $0.9_{-0.3}^{+0.6} \times 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$ and for the
more massive halo of $2.3_{-0.9}^{+1.0} \times 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$,
consistent with independent measurements of the masses of MW and M31,

to further constrain all measurements and determine that the MW is very likely
to be the lower mass object of the two.

surface operators have been recently identified and each class has a specific
calibration form - a 3-form in $AdS_7\times S^4$ whose pullback to the M2-brane
world-volume is equal to the volume form. In all but one class, the appropriate
forms are closed, so the action of the M2-brane is easily expressed in terms of
boundary data, which is the geometry of the surface. Specifically, for surfaces
of vanishing anomaly, it is proportional to the integral of the square of the
extrinsic curvature. This can be extended to the case of surfaces with
anomalies, by taking the ratio of two surfaces with the same anomaly. This
gives a slew of new expectation values at large $N$ in this theory.
  For one specific class of surface operators, which are Lagrangian
submanifolds of ${\mathbb R}^4\subset {\mathbb R}^6$, the structure is far
richer and we find that the M2-branes are special Lagrangian submanifold of an

from Keck/HIRES. We also include the Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric acceleration
and all published astrometry and radial velocities into an updated orbit

monitoring and lead to significant updates to BC's barycentric orbit compared

the singularity structure - whether it is anisotropic shear or energy density,
can be easily determined from the generalized Friedmann equation. However, in
non-singular bouncing anisotropic models these insights are difficult to obtain
in the quantum gravity regime where the singularity is resolved at a
non-vanishing mean volume which can be large compared to the Planck volume,
depending on the initial conditions. Such non-singular models may also lack a
generalized Friedmann equation making the task even more difficult. We address
this problem in an effective spacetime description of loop quantum cosmology
(LQC) where energy density and anisotropic shear are universally bounded due to
quantum geometry effects, but a generalized Friedmann equation has been
difficult to derive due to the underlying complexity. Performing extensive
numerical simulations of effective Hamiltonian dynamics, we bring to light a
surprising, seemingly universal relationship between energy density and
anisotropic shear at the bounce in LQC. For a variety of initial conditions for
a massless scalar field, an inflationary potential, and two types of ekpyrotic
potentials we find that the values of energy density and the anisotropic shear
at the quantum bounce follow a novel parabolic relationship which reveals some
surprising results about the anisotropic nature of the bounce, such as the
maximum value of the anisotropic shear at the bounce is reached when the energy
density reaches approximately half of its maximum allowed value. The
relationship we find can prove very useful for developing our understanding of
the degree of anisotropy of the bounce, isotropization of the post-bounce
universe, and discovering the modified generalized Friedmann equation in
Bianchi-I models with quantum gravity corrections.

Optical photometry taken during 2020--2021 shows a dramatic dimming of
${\Delta}$g${\approx}$1 mag, followed by a rapid recovery on a timescale of
several months, with the ${\lesssim}$2 month period of rebrightening captured
in new SDSS-V and Las Cumbres Observatory spectroscopy. This is one of the
fastest CLAGN transitions observed to date. Archival observations suggest that
the object experienced a much more gradual dimming over the period of

accompanied by dramatic variations in the quasar-like continuum and broad-line
emission. The excellent agreement between the pre- and postdip photometric and
spectroscopic appearances of the source, as well as the fact that the dimmest
spectra can be reproduced by applying a single extinction law to the brighter
spectral states, favor a variable line-of-sight obscuration as the driver of
the observed transitions. Such an interpretation faces several theoretical
challenges, and thus an alternative accretion-driven scenario cannot be
excluded. The recent events observed in this quasar highlight the importance of
spectroscopic monitoring of large active galactic nucleus samples on

existence, and organisation of a subset of them in one, or possibly two,
mis-aligned disks, is puzzling. Due to a combination of low medium density and
strong tidal forces in the vicinity of Sgr A*, stars are not expected to form.
Here we propose a novel scenario for their in-situ formation: a jetted tidal
disruption event (TDE) from an older wandering star triggers an episode of
positive feedback of star formation in the plane perpendicular to the jet, as
demonstrated via numerical simulations in the context of jet-induced feedback
in galactic outflows. An over-pressured cocoon surrounding the jet
shock-compresses clumps to densities high enough to resist the SMBH tidal
field. The TDE rate of $10^{-5}-10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$ per galaxy, out of which a
few percent events are jetted, implies a jetted TDE event per galaxy to occur
every few million years. This timescale is interestingly of the same order of
the age of the disk stars. The mass function predicted by our mechanism is
top-heavy. Additionally, since TDEs are isotropic, our model predicts a random
orientation for the disk of stars with respect to the plane of the galaxy and,
due to the relatively high TDE rate, it can account for multiple disks of stars
with uncorrelated orientations.

patterns in twisted bilayer systems. The formation of such patterns is a
consequence of an interplay between twist and strain which gives rise to a
collapse of the reciprocal space unit cell. As a criterion for such collapse we
find a simple relation between the two quantities and the material specific
Poisson ratio. The induced one dimensional behavior is characterized by two,
usually incommensurate, periodicities. Our results offer explanations for the
complex patterns of one-dimensional channels observed in low angle twisted
bilayer graphene systems and twisted bilayer dicalcogenides. Our findings can
be applied to any hexagonal twisted moir\'e pattern and can be easily extended
to other geometries.

Bell inequality violations can be explained only if causal dependencies are

realizing one such example: the triangle causal network, consisting of three
measurement stations pairwise connected by common causes and no external

three known techniques: (i) a machine-learning-based heuristic test, (ii) a

``entangling'' or ``disentangling'', separated by a transition as a function of
the rate at which measurements are made on the system. Producing an analytical
theory of this measurement-induced transition is an outstanding challenge.
Recent work made progress in the context of tree tensor networks, which can be
related to all-to-all quantum circuit dynamics with forced (postselected)
measurement outcomes. So far, however, there are no exact solutions for
dynamics of spin-1/2 degrees of freedom (qubits) with ``real'' measurements,
whose outcome probabilities are sampled according to the Born rule. Here we
define dynamical processes for qubits, with real measurements, that have a
tree-like spacetime interaction graph, either collapsing or expanding the
system as a function of time. The former case yields an exactly solvable
measurement transition. We explore these processes analytically and
numerically, exploiting the recursive structure of the tree. We compare the
case of ``real'' measurements with the case of ``forced'' measurements. Both
cases show a transition at a nontrivial value of the measurement strength, with
the real measurement case exhibiting a smaller entangling phase. Both exhibit
exponential scaling of the entanglement near the transition, but they differ in
the value of a critical exponent. An intriguing difference between the two
cases is that the real measurement case lies at the boundary between two
distinct types of critical scaling. On the basis of our results we propose a
protocol for realizing a measurement phase transition experimentally via an
expansion process.

carried out training for two different scenarios: navigating to a designated

intracluster medium (ICM) turbulence and nonthermal characteristics of radio
halos in the LoTSS-DR2. We analyzed XMM-Newton and Chandra archival X-ray data

dynamic states of the clusters. We also performed a power spectral analysis of
the X-ray surface brightness (SB) fluctuations to investigate large-scale
density perturbations and estimate the turbulent velocity dispersion. The power
spectral analysis results in a large scatter density fluctuation amplitude. We
therefore only found a marginal anticorrelation between density fluctuations
and cluster relaxation state, and we did not find a correlation between density
fluctuations and radio halo power. Nevertheless, the injected power for
particle acceleration calculated from turbulent dissipation is correlated with
the radio halo power, where the best-fit unity slope supports the turbulent
(re)acceleration scenario. Two different acceleration models, transit-time
damping and adiabatic stochastic acceleration, cannot be distinguished due to
the large scatter of the estimated turbulent Mach number. We introduced a new
quantity $[kT\cdot Y_X]_{r_\mathrm{RH}}$, which is proportional to the
turbulent acceleration power assuming a constant Mach number. This quantity is
strongly correlated with radio halo power, where the slope is also unity.

2D GAN inversion: not only does it allow multi-view consistent editing of the
projected image, but it also enables 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis
when given only a single image. However, the explicit viewpoint control acts as
a main hindrance in the 3D GAN inversion process, as both camera pose and
latent code have to be optimized simultaneously to reconstruct the given image.
Most works that explore the latent space of the 3D-aware GANs rely on
ground-truth camera viewpoint or deformable 3D model, thus limiting their
applicability. In this work, we introduce a generalizable 3D GAN inversion
method that infers camera viewpoint and latent code simultaneously to enable

leverage pre-trained estimators for better initialization and utilize the

  Maximization of Relay Nodes in Payment Channel Networks","28 pages",,,,"cs.DC cs.CR cs.LG cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Payment channel networks (PCNs) are a layer-2 blockchain scalability
solution, with its main entity, the payment channel, enabling transactions
between pairs of nodes ""off-chain,"" thus reducing the burden on the layer-1
network. Nodes with multiple channels can serve as relays for multihop payments
over a path of channels: they relay payments of others by providing the
liquidity of their channels, in exchange for part of the amount withheld as a
fee. Relay nodes might after a while end up with one or more unbalanced
channels, and thus need to trigger a rebalancing operation. In this paper, we
study how a relay node can maximize its profits from fees by using the
rebalancing method of submarine swaps. We introduce a stochastic model to
capture the dynamics of a relay node observing random transaction arrivals and
performing occasional rebalancing operations, and express the system evolution
as a Markov Decision Process. We formulate the problem of the maximization of
the node's fortune over time over all rebalancing policies, and approximate the
optimal solution by designing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based
rebalancing policy. We build a discrete event simulator of the system and use
it to demonstrate the DRL policy's superior performance under most conditions
by conducting a comparative study of different policies and parameterizations.
In all, our approach aims to be the first to introduce DRL for network
optimization in the complex world of PCNs.

experimental results can in general be interpreted in a framework where the
response of detector materials to an external DM probe is described by a single
ionisation or crystal form factor, as expected for the so-called dark photon
model. Here, ionisation and crystal form factors are examples of material
response functions: interaction-specific integrals of the initial and final
state electron wave functions. In this work, we address this question through a
systematic classification of the material response functions induced by a wide
range of models for spin-0, spin-1/2 and spin-1 DM. We find several examples
for which an accurate description of the electronic transition rate at DM
direct detection experiments requires material response functions that go
beyond those expected for the dark photon model. This concretely illustrates
the limitations of a framework that is entirely based on the standard
ionisation and crystal form factors, and points towards the need for the
general response-function-based formalism we pushed forward recently [1,2]. For
the models that require non-standard atomic and crystal response functions, we
use the response functions of [1,2] to calculate the DM-induced electronic
transition rate in atomic and crystal detectors, and to present 90% confidence

an evolving model of counts-of-counts data that arises as the family size
counts of samples taken sequentially from a Birth process with Immigration

increasing concern about the ongoing emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2 that
may evade the immune response provided by vaccines. New variants appear due to
mutation, and as the cases accumulate, the probability of the emergence of a
variant of concern increases. In this article, we propose a modified SIR model
with waning immunity that captures the competition of two strain classes of an
infectious disease under the effect of vaccination with a highly contagious and
deadly strain class emerging from a prior strain due to mutation. When these
strains compete for a limited supply of susceptible individuals, changes in the
efficiency of vaccines may affect the behaviour of the disease in a non-trivial
way, resulting in complex outcomes. We characterise the parameter space
including intrinsic parameters of the disease, and using the vaccine
efficiencies as control variables. We find different types of transcritical
bifurcations between endemic fixed points and a disease-free equilibrium and
identify a region of strain competition where the two strain classes coexist
during a transient period. We show that a strain can be extinguished either due
to strain competition or vaccination, and we obtain the critical values of the
efficiency of vaccines to eradicate the disease. Numerical studies using
parameters estimated from publicly reported data agree with our theoretical

embedding can capture functional relations in learned representations. Existing
hypergraph neural network models often focus on node-level or graph-level
inference. There is an unmet need in learning powerful representations of

SHINE uses informative genetic pathways that encode molecular functions as

end-to-end subgraph classification and hypergraph nodes' similarity

to the fine-precision it can achieve over long ranges. However, high frame
rate, high resolution lidar devices produce an enormous amount of
time-of-flight (ToF) data which can cause a severe data processing bottleneck
hindering the deployment of real-time systems. In this paper, an efficient
photon counting approach is proposed that exploits the simplicity of piecewise
polynomial splines to form a hardware-friendly compressed statistic, or a
so-called spline sketch, of the ToF data without sacrificing the quality of the
recovered image. As each piecewise polynomial spline is a simple function with
limited support over the timing depth window, the spline sketch can be computed
efficiently on-chip with minimal computational overhead. We show that a
piecewise linear or quadratic spline sketch, requiring minimal on-chip
arithmetic computation per photon detection, can reconstruct real-world depth
images with negligible loss of resolution whilst achieving $95\%$ compression
compared to the full ToF data, as well as offering multi-peak detection
performance. These contrast with previously proposed coarse binning histograms
that suffer from a highly nonuniform accuracy across depth and can fail
catastrophically when associated with bright reflectors. Further, by building
range-walk correction into the proposed estimation algorithms, it is
demonstrated that the spline sketches can be made robust to photon pile-up
effects. The computational complexity of both the reconstruction and range walk
correction algorithms scale only with the size of the spline sketch which is
independent to both the photon count and temporal resolution of the lidar
device.

experiments well before local thermal equilibrium is established. This
unexpectedly rapid onset of hydrodynamics -- which takes place on the fastest
available timescale -- is called hydrodynamization. It occurs when an
interacting quantum system is quenched with an energy density that is much
greater than its initial energy density. During hydrodynamization, energy gets
redistributed across very different energy scales. Hydrodynamization precedes
local equilibration among momentum modes, which is local prethermalization to a
generalized Gibbs ensemble in nearly integrable systems or local thermalization
in non-integrable systems. Many theories of quantum dynamics postulate local
(pre)thermalization, but the associated timescale has not been quantitatively
studied. Here we use an array of 1D Bose gases to directly observe both
hydrodynamization and local prethermalization. After we apply a Bragg
scattering pulse, hydrodynamization is evident in the fast redistribution of
energy among distant momentum modes, which occurs on timescales associated with
the Bragg peak energies. Local prethermalization can be seen in the slower
redistribution of occupation among nearby momentum modes. We find that the time
scale for local prethermalization in our system is inversely proportional to
the momenta involved. During hydrodynamization and local prethermalization,
existing theories cannot quantitatively model our experiment. Exact theoretical

recently, Prospect Theory has been demonstrated as a useful tool in behavioral
economics and cognitive psychology for deriving human behavioral models that
characterize their subjective decision-making in the presence of stochastic
uncertainties and risks, as an alternative to conventional Utility Theory
\citep{kahneman_prospect_2012}. These models will be described in this article.

interventions in routine practice conditions, and researchers often adopt
model-based methods with covariate adjustment in the statistical analyses.
However, the validity of model-based covariate adjustment is unclear when the
working models are misspecified, leading to ambiguity of estimands and risk of
bias. In this article, we first adapt two conventional model-based methods,
generalized estimating equations and linear mixed models, with weighted
g-computation to achieve robust inference for cluster-average and
individual-average treatment effects. Furthermore, we propose an efficient
estimator for each estimand that allows for flexible covariate adjustment and
additionally addresses cluster size variation dependent on treatment assignment
and other cluster characteristics. Such cluster size variations often occur
post-randomization and, if ignored, can lead to bias of model-based estimators.
For our proposed estimator, we prove that when the nuisance functions are
consistently estimated by machine learning algorithms, the estimator is
consistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient. When the nuisance functions
are estimated via parametric working models, the estimator is triply-robust.
Simulation studies and analyses of three real-world cluster-randomized
experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods are superior to existing
alternatives.

respect to indexing types, funding availability, journal or conference
publishing options together with distributions of these metrics along years to
evaluate the popularity trends in a detailed manner. Web of Science (WoS)

all DL and ML-related studies. Results related to scientific impact indicate
that DL studies get slightly more average normalized citation (2.256) compared

data efficiency when learning for robot control. This paper proposes a novel
approach for learning dynamics leveraging the symmetry in the underlying

Existing frameworks that represent all data in vector space fail to consider
the structured information of the robot, such as leg symmetry, rotational
symmetry, and physics invariance. As a result, these schemes require vast
amounts of training data to learn the system's redundant elements because they
are learned independently. Instead, we propose considering the geometric prior
by representing the system in symmetrical object groups and designing neural
network architecture to assess invariance and equivariance between the objects.
Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the
generalization to unseen data of the proposed model and the existing models. We
also implement a controller of a climbing robot based on learned inverse
dynamics models. The results show that our method generates accurate control
inputs that help the robot reach the desired state while requiring less

in the absence of the emitter the coupled cavity version of this setup is not
only capable of nonreciprocal light propagation but can also exhibit slow &
fast light propagation. In this work, we investigate in what ways the presence

Under the weak-excitation assumption and mean-field approximation, we find that
the interplay between the rotational/spinning Sagnac-effect and the qubit
coupling can lead to the enhancement both in the optomechanically induced
transparency (OMIT) peak value and in the width of the transparency window due
to the opening of qubit-assisted back reflection channel. However, compared to
the no-qubit case, we notice that such an enhancement comes at the cost of
degrading the group delay in probe light transmission by a factor of 1/2 for
clockwise rotary directions. The target applications of these results can be in
the areas of quantum circuitry and in non-reciprocal quantum communication
protocols where QEs are a key component.

resources of a single vehicle are often insufficient to process a CI-App; (C2)
The dynamics of available resources, caused by vehicles' mobility, hinder
reliable CI-App processing. This work is among the first to jointly address
(C1) and (C2), while considering two common CI-App graph representations,
directed acyclic graph (DAG) and undirected graph (UG). To address (C1), we
consider partitioning a CI-App with $m$ dependent (sub-)tasks into $k\le m$
groups, which are dispersed across vehicles. To address (C2), we introduce a
generalized reliability metric called conditional mean time to failure
(C-MTTF). Subsequently, we increase the C-MTTF of dependent sub-tasks
processing via introducing a general framework of redundancy-based processing
of dependent sub-tasks over semi-dynamic VCs (RP-VC). We demonstrate that RP-VC
can be modeled as a non-trivial semi-Markov process (SMP). To analyze this SMP
model and its reliability, we develop a novel mathematical framework, called
event stochastic algebra ($\langle e\rangle$-algebra). Based on $\langle
e\rangle$-algebra, we propose decomposition theorem (DT) to transform the
presented SMP to a decomposed SMP (D-SMP). We subsequently calculate the C-MTTF
of our methodology. We demonstrate that $\langle e\rangle$-algebra and DT are
general mathematical tools that can be used to analyze other cloud-based

the efficiency of our methodology in terms of acceptance and success rates of

  Under the Limit!","28 pages, submitted to JSS (in Practice Track)",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Software design techniques are undoubtedly crucial in the process of
designing good software. Over the years, a large number of design techniques
have been proposed by both researchers and practitioners. Unfortunately,
despite their uniqueness, it is not uncommon to find software products that
make subpar design decisions, leading to design degradation challenges. One
potential reason for this behavior is that developers do not have a clear
vision of how much a code unit could grow; without this vision, a code unit can
grow endlessly, even when developers are equipped with an arsenal of design
practices. Different than other design techniques, Cognitive Driven Development
(CDD for short) focuses on 1) defining and 2) limiting the number of coding
elements that developers could use at a given code unit.
  In this paper, we report on the experiences of a software development team in
using CDD for building from scratch a learning management tool at Zup
Innovation, a Brazilian tech company. By curating commit traces left in the
repositories, combined with the developers' perception, we organized a set of
findings and lessons that could be useful for those interested in adopting CDD.
For instance, we noticed that by using CDD, despite the evolution of the
product, developers were able to keep the code units under a small amount of
size (in terms of size). Furthermore, although limiting the complexity is at
the heart of CDD, we also discovered that developers tend to relax this notion
of limit so that they can cope with the different complexities of the software.
Still, we noticed that CDD could also influence testing practices; limiting the
code units' size makes testing easier to perform.

annual average number of citations and the number of access were analyzed to
quantitatively reveal the effects on the scientific audience. It's outlined
that deep learning-based studies gained momentum after year 2013, and the rate
of graph-based approaches in all deep learning studies increased linearly from
1% to 4% within the following 10 years. Conference publications scanned in the
Conference Proceeding Citation Index (CPCI) on the graph-based approaches
receive significantly more citations. The citation counts of the SCI-Expanded

other. While the citation performances of the supported and unsupported
publications of the two sides were similar, pure deep learning studies received
more citations on the journal publication side and graph-based approaches
received more citations on the conference side. Despite their similar
performance in recent years, graph-based studies show twice more citation
performance as they get older, compared to traditional approaches. Annual
average citation performance per article for all deep learning studies is
11.051 in 2014, while it is 22.483 for graph-based studies. Also, despite
receiving 16% more access, graph-based papers get almost the same overall

graph-based approaches need a greater bunch of attention to follow, while pure

of this study is to analyze the change in pulmonary arterial network
morphometry in the presence of HPH. To do so, we use novel methods from

able to learn high-quality representations for complex data without data
labels. Prior work shows that, besides obviating the reliance on labeling, SSL
also benefits adversarial robustness by making it more challenging for the
adversary to manipulate model prediction. However, whether this robustness
benefit generalizes to other types of attacks remains an open question.
  We explore this question in the context of trojan attacks by showing that SSL
is comparably vulnerable as supervised learning to trojan attacks.
Specifically, we design and evaluate CTRL, an extremely simple self-supervised
trojan attack. By polluting a tiny fraction of training data (less than 1%)
with indistinguishable poisoning samples, CTRL causes any trigger-embedded
input to be misclassified to the adversary's desired class with a high
probability (over 99%) at inference. More importantly, through the lens of
CTRL, we study the mechanisms underlying self-supervised trojan attacks. With
both empirical and analytical evidence, we reveal that the representation
invariance property of SSL, which benefits adversarial robustness, may also be
the very reason making SSL highly vulnerable to trojan attacks. We further
discuss the fundamental challenges to defending against self-supervised trojan
attacks, pointing to promising directions for future research.

factors generating the data (e.g. color or background). Existing
disentanglement methods, however, rely on an often unrealistic assumption: that
factors are statistically independent. In reality, factors (like object color
and shape) are correlated. To address this limitation, we consider the use of a
relaxed disentanglement criterion -- the Hausdorff Factorized Support (HFS)
criterion -- that encourages only pairwise factorized \emph{support}, rather
than a factorial distribution, by minimizing a Hausdorff distance. This allows
for arbitrary distributions of the factors over their support, including
correlations between them. We show that the use of HFS consistently facilitates
disentanglement and recovery of ground-truth factors across a variety of
correlation settings and benchmarks, even under severe training correlations
and correlation shifts, with in parts over $+60\%$ in relative improvement over
existing disentanglement methods. In addition, we find that leveraging HFS for

based on a Structure-from-Motion orthomap and digital elevation model of a
rocky fault scarp in the Volcanic Tablelands, eastern California. By
post-processing the deep learning results, we build a semantic rock map and
analyze rock trait distributions. The resulting semantic map contains nearly
230,000 rocks with effective diameters ranging from 2 cm to 250 cm. Rock trait
distributions provide a new perspective on rocky fault scarp development and
extend past research on scarp geometry including slope, height, and length.
Heatmaps indicate rock size spatial distributions on the fault scarp and
surrounding topographic flats. Median grain size changes perpendicular to the
fault scarp trace with the largest rocks exposed on and downslope from the
scarp footwall. Correlation analyses of the segmented fault scarp illustrate
the relationship between rock trait statistics and fault scarp geomorphology.
Local fault scarp height correlates with median grain size (R2 of 0.6), the
mean grain size of the largest rocks (R2 of 0.76), and the ratio of the number
of small to large rocks (R2 of 0.40). The positive correlation (R2 of 0.81)
between local fault scarp height and standard deviation of grain size suggests
that rocks on a higher fault scarp are less well sorted. The correlation
analysis between fault scarp height and rock orientation statistics supports a
particle transportation model in which locally higher fault scarps have
relatively more rocks with long axes parallel to fault scarp trace because
rocks have a larger distance to roll and orient the long axes. Our work
demonstrates a data-driven approach to geomorphology based on rock trait
distributions, promising a greater understanding of fault scarp formation, as

demographic classes. Our results, when employing a multilingual PLM, show
substantial gains in task performance across four languages (English, German,

However, controlling for confounding factors - primarily domain and language
proficiency of Transformer-based PLMs - shows that downstream performance gains
from our demographic adaptation do not actually stem from demographic
knowledge. Our results indicate that demographic specialization of PLMs, while
holding promise for positive societal impact, still represents an unsolved

together many Vizing chains to form what Bernshteyn [Ber'2022] coined
\emph{multi-step Vizing chains}.
  In this paper, we propose a slightly more general definition of this term. We
then apply multi-step Vizing chain constructions to prove combinatorial
properties of edge colourings that lead to (improved) algorithms for computing
edge colouring across different models of computation. This approach seems
especially powerful for constructing augmenting subgraphs which respect some
notion of locality.
  First, we construct strictly local multi-step Vizing chains and use them to
show a local version of Vizings Theorem thus confirming a recent conjecture of
Bonamy, Delcourt, Lang and Postle [BDLP'2020]. Our proof is constructive and
also implies an algorithm for computing such a colouring.
  Then, we show that for any uncoloured edge there exists an augmenting
subgraph of size O(\Delta^{7}\log n), answering an open problem of Bernshteyn
[Ber'2022]. Chang, He, Li, Pettie and Uitto [CHLPU'2018] show a lower bound of
\Omega(\Delta \log \frac{n}{\Delta}) for the size of such augmenting subgraphs,
so the upper bound is tight up to \Delta and constant factors.
  These ideas also extend to give a faster deterministic LOCAL algorithm for
(\Delta + 1)-edge colouring running in \tilde{O}(\poly(\Delta)\log^6 n) rounds.
These results improve the recent breakthrough result of Bernshteyn [Ber'2022],
who showed the existence of augmenting subgraphs of size O(\Delta^6\log^2 n),
and used these to give the first (\Delta + 1)-edge colouring algorithm in the
LOCAL model running in O(\poly(\Delta, \log n)) rounds. ... (see paper for the

strategy is based on the use of the DLB library to redistribute the computing
resources at node level, lending additional CPU-cores to higher loaded MPI
processes. This approach does not require explicit data transfer and is
activated automatically at runtime. Two chemistry descriptions, detailed and
reduced, are evaluated on two different configurations: laminar counterflow
flame and a turbulent swirl-stabilized flame. For single-node calculations,
speedups of 2.3x and 7x are obtained for the detailed and reduced chemistry,
respectively. Results on multi-node runs also show that DLB improves the
performance of the pure-MPI code similar to single node runs. It is shown DLB
can get performance improvements in both detailed and reduced chemistry
calculations.

sparsity of point clouds. Built upon the idea of window-based Transformers,
SWFormer converts 3D points into sparse voxels and windows, and then processes
these variable-length sparse windows efficiently using a bucketing scheme. In
addition to self-attention within each spatial window, our SWFormer also
captures cross-window correlation with multi-scale feature fusion and window
shifting operations. To further address the unique challenge of detecting 3D
objects accurately from sparse features, we propose a new voxel diffusion
technique. Experimental results on the Waymo Open Dataset show our SWFormer
achieves state-of-the-art 73.36 L2 mAPH on vehicle and pedestrian for 3D object
detection on the official test set, outperforming all previous single-stage and

has been so successful in simpler physical systems. In Anderson's seminal work
on why ""more is different"" he pointed to how emergent, macroscale patterns
break symmetries of the underlying microscale laws. Yet, less recognized is
that these large-scale, emergent patterns must also retain some symmetries of
the microscale rules. Here we introduce a new, relational macrostate theory
(RMT) that defines macrostates in terms of symmetries between two mutually
predictive observations, and develop a machine learning architecture, MacroNet,
that identifies macrostates. Using this framework, we show how macrostates can
be identifed across systems ranging in complexity from the simplicity of the
simple harmonic oscillator to the much more complex spatial patterning
characteristic of Turing instabilities. Furthermore, we show how our framework
can be used for the inverse design of microstates consistent with a given
macroscopic property -- in Turing patterns this allows us to design underlying
rule with a given specification of spatial patterning, and to identify which
rule parameters most control these patterns. By demonstrating a general theory
for how macroscopic properties emerge from conservation of symmetries in the
mapping between observations, we provide a machine learning framework that
allows a unified approach to identifying macrostates in systems from the simple

tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ with high precision. Delensing is an important
process as the observed CMB $B$-mode polarization that contains the primordial
tensor perturbation signal is dominated by a much larger contribution due to
gravitational lensing. To do so successfully, it is useful to explore methods
for lensing reconstruction beyond the traditional quadratic estimator (QE)
(which will become suboptimal for the next-generation experiments), and the
maximum a posterior estimator (which is still currently under development). In
Caldeira et al. 2020, the authors showed that a neural network (NN) method
using the ResUNet architectrue performs better than the QE and slightly
suboptimally compared to the iterative estimator in terms of the lensing
reconstruction performance. In this work, we take one step further to evaluate
the delensing performance of these estimators on maps with primordial tensor
perturbations using a standard delensing pipeline, and show that the
\emph{delensing} performance of the NN estimator is optimal, agreeing with that
of a converged iterative estimator, when tested on a suite of simulations with
$r=0.01$ and $r=0.001$ for $12.7^{\circ} \times 12.7^{\circ}$ maps at a
CMB-Stage~4 like polarization noise level $1\,\mu \rm{K\,arcmin}$ and 1' beam.
We found that for the purpose of delensing, it is necessary to train and
evaluate the NN on a set of CMB maps with $l<l_{\rm{cut}}$ removed, in order to
avoid spurious correlations on the scales of interest for the final delensed
$B$-mode power spectrum $l<l_{\rm{cut}}$, similar to what was known previously
for the QE and the iterative estimator. We also present various NN training
techniques that can be extended for a simultaneous treatment of foregrounds and
more complex instrumental effects where the modeling is more uncertain.

as robustness, fairness, and generalization. Existing methods for computing
Lipschitz constants either produce relatively loose upper bounds or are limited
to small networks. In this paper, we develop an efficient framework for
computing the $\ell_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant of a neural network by
tightly upper bounding the norm of Clarke Jacobian via linear bound
propagation. We formulate the computation of local Lipschitz constants with a
linear bound propagation process on a high-order backward graph induced by the
chain rule of Clarke Jacobian. To enable linear bound propagation, we derive
tight linear relaxations for specific nonlinearities in Clarke Jacobian. This
formulate unifies existing ad-hoc approaches such as RecurJac, which can be
seen as a special case of ours with weaker relaxations. The bound propagation
framework also allows us to easily borrow the popular Branch-and-Bound (BaB)
approach from neural network verification to further tighten Lipschitz
constants. Experiments show that on tiny models, our method produces comparable
bounds compared to exact methods that cannot scale to slightly larger models;
on larger models, our method efficiently produces tighter results than existing
relaxed or naive methods, and our method scales to much larger practical models
that previous works could not handle. We also demonstrate an application on
provable monotonicity analysis. Code is available at

asymmetries and needle-like features that have been attributed to perturbations
by a massive, and unusually distant external planetary companion. Here, we
revisit the long-term secular dynamical evolution of the HD 106906 disc
allowing for the combined gravitational action of the planetary companion and
the inner stellar binary which holds the system together. We argue that the
binary is strong enough to impose a dynamical break at the disc's location,
resulting in distinctive observational signatures which we render via simulated
surface density maps and vertical structure profiles. Within uncertainties on
the planet's orbit, we show that the disc can go from being fully dominated by
the inner binary to significantly so, and is hardly ever outside its reach. The
extent of binary dominance impacts the disc's mean eccentricity, a metric which
we map as a function of the planet's semi-major axis and orbital eccentricity,
with and without radiation pressure. We can thus constrain the planet's orbit
to ease the tension between evident axisymmetry in the millimeter, and apparent
asymmetry in scattered light. We discuss phase space structure, then
inclination distribution, arguing for the relevance of our results to a variety
of hierarchical systems, as we set the stage for generalizations that allow for
disc self-gravity and collisional evolution.

received great interest in recent decades. The beginning was by representing
cyclic codes over finite fields as ideals in the polynomial ring. Subsequently,
studying the duals of constacyclic, quasi-cyclic, quasi-twisted, generalized
quasi-cyclic, and multi-twisted codes appeared extensively in literature. We
consider the class of multi-twisted (MT) codes because it extends to all of
these codes. We describe a MT code $\mathcal{C}$ as a module over a principal
ideal domain. Hence, $\mathcal{C}$ has a generator polynomial matrix (GPM) that
satisfies an identical equation. The reduced GPM of $\mathcal{C}$ is the
Hermite normal form of its GPM. We show that the Euclidean dual
$\mathcal{C}^\perp$ of $\mathcal{C}$ is MT as well. We prove a formula for a
GPM of $\mathcal{C}^\perp$ using the identical equation of the reduced GPM of
$\mathcal{C}$. Then we aim to replace the Euclidean dual with the Galois dual.
The Galois inner product is an asymmetric form, so we distinguish between the
right and left Galois duals. We show that the right and left Galois duals of a
MT code are MT as well but with possibly different shift constants. Our study
is the first to contain the right and left Galois duals of a linear code
simultaneously. This gives two advantages: establishing their interconnected
identities and introducing the two-sided Galois dual that has not previously
appeared in the literature. We use a condition for the two-sided Galois dual of
a MT code to be MT, hence its GPM is characterized. Two special cases are also
studied, one when the right and left Galois duals trivially intersect and the
other when they coincide. The latter case is considered for any linear code,
where a necessary and sufficient condition is established for the equality of
the right and left Galois duals.

Comput. Phys., 1977) is
useful for problems involving fluid-structure interactions or complex
geometries. By making use of a regular grid that is independent of the
geometry, the IB framework yields a robust numerical scheme that can
efficiently handle immersed deformable structures. The IB method has also been
adapted to problems with prescribed motion and other PDEs with given boundary
data. IB methods for these problems traditionally involve penalty forces that
only approximately satisfy boundary conditions, or they are formulated as
constraint problems. In the latter approach, one must find the unknown forces
by solving an equation that corresponds to a poorly conditioned first-kind
integral equation. This operation can therefore require a large number of
iterations of a Krylov method, and since a time-dependent problem requires this
solve at each time step, this method can be prohibitively inefficient without
preconditioning. This dissertation introduces a new, well-conditioned IB
formulation for boundary value problems, called the Immersed Boundary Double
Layer (IBDL) method. We formulate it for Poisson, Helmholtz, Brinkman, Stokes,
and Navier-Stokes equations and demonstrate its efficiency over the other
constraint method. In this new formulation, the equation for the unknown
boundary distribution corresponds to a well-conditioned second-kind integral
equation that can be solved efficiently with a small number of iterations of a
Krylov method. Furthermore, the iteration count is independent of both the mesh
size and the boundary point spacing. The method converges away from the
boundary, and when combined with a local interpolation, it converges in the
entire PDE domain. Additionally, while the original constraint method applies
only to Dirichlet problems, the IBDL formulation can also be used for Neumann

Its study is notoriously challenging due to the interplay of long and short

structure changes. The inherent coupling of lattice and electronic degrees of
freedom opens the avenue towards mechanical actuation of single domains. In
this work, we show that we can manipulate and monitor the reversible
semiconductor-to-metal transition of VO2 while applying a controlled amount of
mechanical pressure by a nanosized metallic probe using an atomic force
microscope. At a critical pressure, we can reversibly actuate the phase
transition with a large modulation of the conductivity. Direct tunneling
through the VO2-metal contact is observed as the main charge carrier injection
mechanism before and after the phase transition of VO2. The tunneling barrier
is formed by a very thin but persistently insulating surfacelayer of the VO2.
The necessary pressure to induce the transition decreases with temperature. In
addition, we measured the phase coexistence line in a hitherto unexplored
regime. Our study provides valuable information on pressure-induced electronic
modifications of the VO2 properties, as well as on nanoscale metal-oxide
contacts, which can help in the future design of oxide electronics.

detection of an absorption feature in the sky-averaged radio spectrum centred
at 78 MHz. The feature is deeper than expected, and, if confirmed, would call
for new physics. However, different groups have re-analyzed the EDGES data and
questioned the reliability of the signal. The Radio Experiment for the Analysis
of Cosmic Hydrogen (REACH) is a sky-averaged 21-cm experiment aiming at
improving the current observations by tackling the issues faced by current
instruments related to residual systematic signals in the data. The novel
experimental approach focuses on detecting and jointly explaining these
systematics together with the foregrounds and the cosmological signal using
Bayesian statistics. To achieve this, REACH features simultaneous observations
with two different antennas, an ultra wideband system (redshift range 7.5 to

full supervision for contrastive learning in regression tasks using diffusion
MRI tractography. TractoSCR performs supervised contrastive learning by using
the absolute difference between continuous regression labels (i.e.
neurocognitive scores) to determine positive and negative pairs. We apply
TractoSCR to analyze a large-scale dataset including multi-site harmonized
diffusion MRI and neurocognitive data from 8735 participants in the Adolescent

microstructural measures using a fine parcellation of white matter tractography

domains of higher-order cognition (general cognitive ability, executive
function, and learning/memory). To identify important fiber clusters for
prediction of these neurocognitive scores, we propose a permutation feature
importance method for high-dimensional data. We find that TractoSCR improves
the accuracy of neurocognitive score prediction compared to other
state-of-the-art methods. We find that the most predictive fiber clusters are
predominantly located within the superficial white matter and projection
tracts, particularly the superficial frontal white matter and striato-frontal
connections. Overall, our results demonstrate the utility of contrastive

contrastive learning is capable of decomposing the data space into the space

introduce the notion of invariance-adapted latent space that decomposes the

support diverse interactions and socioeconomic mixing. It has been difficult to
assess this hypothesis because past approaches to measuring socioeconomic
mixing have relied on static residential housing data rather than real-life
interactions among people meeting at work, in places of leisure, and in home
neighborhoods. Here we develop a new measure of interaction segegation (IS)
that captures the economic diversity of the set of people that a given person
meets in their everyday life. Leveraging cell phone mobility data to represent
1.6 billion interactions among 9.6 million people in the United States, we
measure interaction segregation across 382 Metropolitan Statistical Areas
(MSAs) and 2829 counties. When averaged across all MSAs, interaction
segregation is 38% lower than a conventional static estimate, which means that
people meet diverse others mostly when outside their home neighborhoods. But,
we also find that interaction segregation is 67% higher in the 10 largest
Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) than in small MSAs with fewer than
100,000 residents. We find evidence that because large cities can offer a
greater choice of differentiated spaces targeted to specific socioeconomic
groups, they end up promoting -- rather than reducing -- everyday economic
segregation. We also discover that this segregation-increasing effect is
countered when hubs of interaction (e.g. shopping malls) are positioned to
bridge diverse neighborhoods and thus attract people of all socioeconomic
statuses. Overall, our findings challenge a long-standing conjecture in human
geography and urban design, and highlight how built environment can both

relies on human annotators to label the moral expressions in text, which
provides training data to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, these
annotations are inherently subjective and some of the instances are hard to

presence of noise in training data harms the classifier's ability to accurately
recognize moral foundations from text. We propose two metrics to audit the
noise of annotations. The first metric is entropy of instance labels, which is
a proxy measure of annotator disagreement about how the instance should be
labeled. The second metric is the silhouette coefficient of a label assigned by
an annotator to an instance. This metric leverages the idea that instances with
the same label should have similar latent representations, and deviations from
collective judgments are indicative of errors. Our experiments on three widely

many variables, which are likely governed by nonlinear dynamics that might have

Furthermore, real-world longitudinal data often suffer from widespread

limited diversity. This observation suggests that information constraints act

latter. This exaggerates the classic Zipf's law inequality in the economic size
of firms and reveals an economy of scale with respect to information. Second,
we reconstruct the topic space firms inhabit, finding that the space resembles
a tangled ""hairball"" with a few dense knots of topics and many specialized
strands sticking out. Some of the topics are ubiquitous, indicating inescapable
demand regardless of firm size. Finally, we connect these pieces in a model of

situations where random fluctuations cannot be ignored, thermal and turbulent
fluctuations being the most relevant examples. Because of the theory's inherent
nonlinearity, fluctuations induce deep and complex changes in the dynamics of
the system. The Martin-Siggia-Rose technique is a powerful tool that allows us
to translate the original hydrodynamic problem into a quantum field theory one,
thus taking advantage of the progress in the treatment of quantum fields out of
equilibrium. To demonstrate this technique, we shall consider the thermal
fluctuations of the spin two modes of a relativistic fluid, in a theory where
hydrodynamics is derived by taking moments of the Boltzmann equation under the
relaxation time approximation.

extending the characters to more languages, recent methods have shown that
training different scripts with different recognition heads can greatly improve
the end-to-end recognition accuracy compared to combining characters from all

between some languages could allow sharing of model parameters and benefit from
joint training. Determining language groupings, however, is not immediately
obvious. To this end, we propose an automatic method for multilingual text
recognition with a task grouping and assignment module using Gumbel-Softmax,
introducing a task grouping loss and weighted recognition loss to allow for
simultaneous training of the models and grouping modules. Experiments on MLT19
lend evidence to our hypothesis that there is a middle ground between combining
every task together and separating every task that achieves a better

acquiring behavioral primitives, there is still a large methodological
disconnect between task-agnostic skill pretraining and downstream, task-aware

phases of learning via the $\textit{skill discriminator}$, a pretraining model
component often discarded during finetuning. Conventional approaches finetune
pretrained agents directly at the policy level, often relying on expensive
environment rollouts to empirically determine the optimal skill. However, often
the most concise yet complete description of a task is the reward function
itself, and skill learning methods learn an $\textit{intrinsic}$ reward
function via the discriminator that corresponds to the skill policy. We propose
to leverage the skill discriminator to $\textit{match}$ the intrinsic and
downstream task rewards and determine the optimal skill for an unseen task
without environment samples, consequently finetuning with greater
sample-efficiency. Furthermore, we generalize IRM to sequence skills for

around the Rindler-Schwarzschild wormhole. First, we introduce this new class
of spacetime, investigating some energy conditions and verifying their
violation in a region nearby the wormhole throat, which means that the object
has to have an exotic energy in order to prevent its collapse. Then, we study
the behavior of the massless scalar field in this spacetime and compute the
effective potential by means of tortoise coordinates. We show that such a
potential is attractive nearby the wormhole throat and that is traversable via
quantum tunneling by massive particles with sufficiently low energies. The
solution of the Klein-Gordon equation is obtained subsequently, showing that
the energy spectrum of the field is subject to a constraint which induces a
decreasing oscillatory behavior. On imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions on a
spherical shell nearby the throat we then determine the particle energy levels,
and we use this spectrum to calculate the quantum revival of the eigenstates.
Finally, we compute the Casimir energy associated with the massless scalar
field at zero temperature. We perform this calculation by means of the sum of
modes method. The zero-point energy is regularized using the Epstein-Hurwitz
zeta-function. We also obtain an analytical expression for the Casimir force
acting on the shell.

the features obtained from MFE, thus making a better match between MFE and UIM.
More precisely, semantic-rich entities are first extracted from the multimodal
data, since they are more relevant to user preferences than other multimodal
information. These entities are then integrated into the user-item interaction
graph. Afterwards, a symmetric linear Graph Convolution Network (GCN) module is
constructed to perform message propagation over the graph, in order to capture
both high-order semantic correlation and collaborative filtering signals.

easy-to-implement method for harmonic selection, with high transmission
efficiency and pulse duration conservation, is still a challenge. Here we
showcase and compare two approaches for selecting the desired harmonic from a
high harmonic generation source while achieving the above goals. The first
approach is the combination of extreme ultraviolet spherical mirrors with
transmission filters and the second approach uses a normal-incidence spherical
grating. Both solutions target time- and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy with photon energies in the 10-20 eV range but are relevant for
other experimental techniques as well. The two approaches for harmonic
selection are characterized in terms of focusing quality, efficiency, and
temporal broadening. It is demonstrated that a focusing grating is able to
provide much higher transmission as compared to the mirror+filter approach (3.3
times higher for 10.8 eV and 12.9 times higher for 18.1 eV), with only a slight
temporal broadening (6.8% increase) and a somewhat larger spot size (~30%
increase). Overall, our study establishes an experimental perspective on the
trade-off between a single grating normal incidence monochromator design and
the use of filters. As such, it provides a basis for selecting the most

down-scattering due to random noises in a weak lensing cluster shear profile.
This non-symmetric scattering probability is caused by a monotonically
decreasing cluster mass function with increasing mass. We examine this bias

perform the standard weak lensing mass estimate of realistic mock clusters, and
find that the weak lensing mass estimate based on the standard $\chi^2$

However, when sensitive information is semantically entangled with the task
information of the input, e.g., gender information is predictive for a
profession, a fair trade-off between task performance and bias mitigation is
difficult to achieve. Existing approaches perform this trade-off by eliminating
bias information from the latent space, lacking control over how much bias is

should use sensitive information 'fairly', rather than blindly eliminating it
(Caliskan et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2019; Bogen et al., 2020). In this work, we
provide a novel debiasing algorithm by adjusting the predictive model's belief
to (1) ignore the sensitive information if it is not useful for the task; (2)
use sensitive information minimally as necessary for the prediction (while also
incurring a penalty). Experimental results on two text classification tasks

  Unsupervised Domain Adaptation","BMVC2022, codes https://github.com/Gxinuu/PCSR",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to solve the domain adaptation
problem by transferring the knowledge learned from a pre-trained source model
to an unseen target domain. Most existing methods assign pseudo-labels to the
target data by generating feature prototypes. However, due to the discrepancy
in the data distribution between the source domain and the target domain and
category imbalance in the target domain, there are severe class biases in the
generated feature prototypes and noisy pseudo-labels. Besides, the data
structure of the target domain is often ignored, which is crucial for
clustering. In this paper, a novel framework named PCSR is proposed to tackle
SFDA via a novel intra-class Polycentric Clustering and Structural
Regularization strategy. Firstly, an inter-class balanced sampling strategy is
proposed to generate representative feature prototypes for each class.
Furthermore, k-means clustering is introduced to generate multiple clustering
centers for each class in the target domain to obtain robust pseudo-labels.
Finally, to enhance the model's generalization, structural regularization is
introduced for the target domain. Extensive experiments on three UDA benchmark
datasets show that our method performs better or similarly against the other
state of the art methods, demonstrating our approach's superiority for visual
domain adaptation problems.

iteration algorithm using the language of forward-backward stochastic

on partial differential equations, our FBSDE-based formulation can be easily
implemented by optimizing criteria over sample data, and is therefore less
sensitive to the state dimension. In particular, both on-policy and off-policy
evaluation methods are discussed by constructing different FBSDEs. The
backward-measurability-loss (BML) criterion is then proposed for solving these
equations. By choosing specific weight functions in the proposed criterion, we
can recover the popular Deep BSDE method or the martingale approach for BSDEs.
The convergence results are established under both ideal and practical
conditions, depending on whether the optimization criteria are decreased to
zero. In the ideal case, we prove that the policy sequences produced by
proposed FBSDE-based algorithms and the standard policy iteration have the same
performance, and thus have the same convergence rate. In the practical case,
the proposed algorithm is still proved to converge robustly under mild

related applications including early detection of abnormalities, fertility

account for the dependent high-dimensional nature of the underlying sensor
signals. In this paper, we introduce Latent Temporal Flows, a method for
multivariate time-series modeling tailored to this setting. We assume that a
set of sequences is generated from a multivariate probabilistic model of an
unobserved time-varying low-dimensional latent vector. Latent Temporal Flows
simultaneously recovers a transformation of the observed sequences into
lower-dimensional latent representations via deep autoencoder mappings, and
estimates a temporally-conditioned probabilistic model via normalizing flows.
Using data from the Apple Heart and Movement Study (AH&MS), we illustrate
promising forecasting performance on these challenging signals. Additionally,
by analyzing two and three dimensional representations learned by our model, we
show that we can identify participants' $\text{VO}_2\text{max}$, a main

mass using an analytic form under the assumption of optically thin emission,
which may lead to substantial underestimation. In this work, we conduct a
parameter study with the goal of investigating the effects of disk structure
and dust properties on the underestimation through self-consistent radiative
transfer models. Different dust models, scattering modes and approaches for
dust settling are considered and compared. The influences of disk
substructures, such as rings and crescents, on the mass derivation are
investigated as well. The results indicate that the traditional analytic method
can underestimate the mass by a factor of a few to hundreds, depending on the
optical depth along the line of sight set mainly by the true dust mass, disk
size and inclination. As an application, we perform a detailed radiative
transfer modeling of the spectral energy distribution of DoAr 33, one of the
observed DSHARP disks. When the DSHARP dust opacities are adopted, the most
probable dust mass returned from the Bayesian analysis is roughly 7 times
higher than the value given by the analytic calculation. Our study demonstrates
that estimating disk dust masses from radiative transfer modeling is one
solution for alleviating the problem of insufficient mass for planet formation

feature can be regarded as fingerprint of the model. If the fingerprint of a
suspected model is the same as the original model, the suspected model is
considered as a pirated model. Experimental results demonstrate that the
fingerprints can be successfully used to verify the ownership of the model and
the test accuracy of the model is not affected. Furthermore, the proposed
method is robust to fine-tuning attack, pruning attack, watermark overwriting
attack, and adaptive attack.

potential for vulnerability propagation. Many empirical studies generalize
third-party dependency governance strategies from a single software ecosystem
to other ecosystems but ignore the differences in the technical structures of
different software ecosystems, making it difficult to directly generalize
security governance strategies from other ecosystems to the Cargo ecosystem. To
fill the gap in this area, this paper constructs a knowledge graph of
dependency vulnerabilities for the Cargo ecosystem using techniques related to
knowledge graphs to address this challenge. This paper is the first large-scale
empirical study in a related research area to address vulnerability propagation
in the Cargo ecosystem. This paper proposes a dependency-vulnerability
knowledge graph parsing algorithm to determine the vulnerability propagation
path and propagation range and empirically studies the characteristics of
vulnerabilities in the Cargo ecosystem, the propagation range, and the factors
that cause vulnerability propagation. Our research has found that the Cargo
ecosystem's security vulnerabilities are primarily memory-related. 18% of the
libraries affected by the vulnerability is still affected by the vulnerability
in the latest version of the library. The number of versions affected by the
propagation of the vulnerabilities is 19.78% in the entire Cargo ecosystem.
This paper looks at the characteristics and propagation factors triggering
vulnerabilities in the Cargo ecosystem. It provides some practical resolution
strategies for administrators of the Cargo community, developers who use Cargo
to manage third-party libraries, and library owners. This paper provides new
ideas for improving the overall security of the Cargo ecosystem.

this approach has demonstrated tumor growth inhibition, and profound
synergistic antitumor effects when combined with traditional platforms of
chemo, radiation and immune therapies. However, the exposure schemes employed
have been broad and underlying mechanisms remain unclear with fundamental
questions about exposures, vessel types and sizes involved, and the nature of
bubble behaviors and their acoustic emissions resulting in vascular damage,
impeding the establishment of standard protocols. Here, ultrasound transmitters
and receivers are integrated into a murine dorsal window chamber tumor model
for intravital microscopy studies capable of real time visual and acoustic
monitoring during antivascular ultrasound. Vessel type (normal and tumor
affected), caliber, and viability are assessed under higher pressure conditions
(1, 2, and 3 MPa), and cavitation signatures are linked to the biological
effects. Vascular events occurred preferentially in tumor affected vessels with
greater incidence in smaller vessels and with more severity as a function of
increasing pressure. Vascular blood flow shutdown was found to be due to a
combination of focal disruption events and network related flow changes.
Acoustic emissions displayed elevated broadband noise and distinct sub and
ultra harmonics and their associated third order peaks with increasing
pressure. The observed vascular events taken collectively with identified
cavitation signatures provide an improved mechanistic understanding of
antivascular ultrasound at the microscale, with implications for establishing a
specific treatment protocol and control platform.

offline datasets without active interactions with the environment. The major
challenge of offline RL is the distribution shift that appears when
out-of-distribution actions are queried, which makes the policy improvement
direction biased by extrapolation errors. Most existing methods address this
problem by penalizing the policy for deviating from the behavior policy during
policy improvement or making conservative updates for value functions during
policy evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel MISA framework to approach
offline RL from the perspective of Mutual Information between States and
Actions in the dataset by directly constraining the policy improvement
direction. Intuitively, mutual information measures the mutual dependence of
actions and states, which reflects how a behavior agent reacts to certain
environment states during data collection. To effectively utilize this
information to facilitate policy learning, MISA constructs lower bounds of
mutual information parameterized by the policy and Q-values. We show that
optimizing this lower bound is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of a
one-step improved policy on the offline dataset. In this way, we constrain the
policy improvement direction to lie in the data manifold. The resulting
algorithm simultaneously augments the policy evaluation and improvement by
adding a mutual information regularization. MISA is a general offline RL
framework that unifies conservative Q-learning (CQL) and behavior
regularization methods (e.g., TD3+BC) as special cases. Our experiments show
that MISA performs significantly better than existing methods and achieves new
state-of-the-art on various tasks of the D4RL benchmark.

widely used in multiple seq2seq tasks. Besides predicting the target sequence,
a side product of CTC is to predict the alignment, which is the most probable
input-long sequence that specifies a hard aligning relationship between the
input and target units. As there are multiple potential aligning sequences
(called paths) that are equally considered in CTC formulation, the choice of
which path will be most probable and become the predicted alignment is always
uncertain. In addition, it is usually observed that the alignment predicted by
vanilla CTC will drift compared with its reference and rarely provides
practical functionalities. Thus, the motivation of this work is to make the CTC
alignment prediction controllable and thus equip CTC with extra

work, in which a customizable Bayes risk function is adopted to enforce the
desired characteristics of the predicted alignment. With the risk function, the
BRCTC is a general framework to adopt some customizable preference over the
paths in order to concentrate the posterior into a particular subset of the

models with the down-sampling ability and reduced inference costs. By using
BRCTC with another preference for early emissions, we obtain an improved

state-of-the-art methods, including heuristic and approximation algorithms,
faced with great difficulties such as theoretical guarantee, time efficiency,
generalization, etc. This makes it unable to adapt to large-scale networks and
more complex applications. On the other side, with the latest achievements of
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in artificial intelligence and other fields,
lots of works have been focused on exploiting DRL to solve combinatorial
optimization problems. Inspired by this, we propose a novel end-to-end DRL
framework, ToupleGDD, to address the IM problem in this paper, which
incorporates three coupled graph neural networks for network embedding and
double deep Q-networks for parameters learning. Previous efforts to solve IM
problem with DRL trained their models on subgraphs of the whole network, and
then tested on the whole graph, which makes the performance of their models
unstable among different networks. However, our model is trained on several
small randomly generated graphs with a small budget, and tested on completely
different networks under various large budgets, which can obtain results very
close to IMM and better results than OPIM-C on several datasets, and shows
strong generalization ability. Finally, we conduct a large number of
experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets, and experimental results prove
the effectiveness and superiority of our model.

  Fluids: Analytical and Lattice Boltzmann Computational Study","55 pages, 29 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Self-rewetting fluids (SRFs), such as aqueous solutions of long-chain
alcohols, exhibit anomalous quadratic dependence of surface tension on
temperature having a minimum and with a positive gradient. When compared to the
normal fluids (NFs), the SRFs can be associated with significantly modified
interfacial dynamics, which have recently been exploited to enhance flow and
thermal transport in various applications (e.g., microgravity and microscale
transport systems). In this work, first, we develop a new analytical solution
of thermocapillary convection in superimposed two SRF layers confined within a
microchannel that is sinusoidally heated on one side and maintained at a
uniform temperature on the other side under the creeping flow regime. Then, a
robust central moment lattice Boltzmann method using the Allen-Cahn equation
for interface tracking, two-fluid motion, and the energy transport for
numerical simulations of SRFs is constructed. The analytical and computational
techniques are generally shown to be in good quantitative agreement with one
another. Moreover, the effect of the various characteristic parameters on the
magnitude and the distribution thermocapillary-driven motion is studied. The
thermocapillary flow patterns in SRFs are shown to be strikingly different when
compared to the NFs: For otherwise the same conditions, the SRFs result in
eight periodic counterrotating thermocapillary convection rolls, while the NFs
exhibit only four such vortices. Moreover, the direction of the circulating
fluid motion in such vortical structures for the SRFs is found to be towards
the hotter zones on the interfaces, which is opposite to that in NFs. By tuning
the sensitivity coefficients of the surface tension on temperature, it is shown
that the magnitude as well the overall thermocapillary flow patterns can be
significantly manipulated.

budget-limited buyers. We focus on first-price auctions, which are increasingly
commonly used in many settings, and consider liquid welfare, a natural and
well-studied generalization of social welfare for buyers with budgets. We use a
behavioral model for the buyers, assuming a learning style guarantee: the
resulting utility of each buyer is within a $\gamma$ factor (where $\gamma\ge
1$) of the utility achievable by shading her value with the same factor at each
round. Under this assumption, we show a $\gamma+1/2+O(1/\gamma)$ price of
anarchy for liquid welfare assuming buyers have additive valuations. This
positive result is in contrast to sequential second-price auctions, where even
with $\gamma=1$, the resulting liquid welfare can be arbitrarily smaller than
the maximum liquid welfare. We prove a lower bound of $\gamma$ on the liquid
welfare loss under the above assumption in first-price auctions, making our
bound asymptotically tight. For the case when $\gamma = 1$ our theorem implies
a price of anarchy upper bound that is about $2.41$; we show a lower bound of
$2$ for that case.
  We also give a learning algorithm that the players can use to achieve the
guarantee needed for our liquid welfare result. Our algorithm achieves utility
within a $\gamma=O(1)$ factor of the optimal utility even when a buyer's values
and the bids of the other buyers are chosen adversarially, assuming the buyer's
budget grows linearly with time. The competitiveness guarantee of the learning
algorithm deteriorates somewhat as the budget grows slower than linearly with
time.
  Finally, we extend our liquid welfare results for the case where buyers have
submodular valuations over the set of items they win across iterations with a
slightly worse price of anarchy bound of $\gamma+1+O(1/\gamma)$ compared to the
guarantee for the additive case.

STAR-transformer learns an efficient multi-feature representation of the

identical to the Fermi surface in the weakly and intermediate coupling regions

difficult in robot applications. One of the key challenges is how to explore
environments efficiently with camera sensors only. Existing navigation methods
mainly focus on fixed cameras and few attempts have been made to navigate with
active cameras. As a result, the agent may take a very long time to perceive
the environment due to limited camera scope. In contrast, humans typically gain
a larger field of view by looking around for a better perception of the
environment. How to make robots perceive the environment as efficiently as
humans is a fundamental problem in robotics. In this paper, we consider
navigating to multiple objects more efficiently with active cameras.
Specifically, we cast moving camera to a Markov Decision Process and
reformulate the active camera problem as a reinforcement learning problem.
However, we have to address two new challenges: 1) how to learn a good camera
policy in complex environments and 2) how to coordinate it with the navigation
policy. To address these, we carefully design a reward function to encourage
the agent to explore more areas by moving camera actively. Moreover, we exploit
human experience to infer a rule-based camera action to guide the learning
process. Last, to better coordinate two kinds of policies, the camera policy
takes navigation actions into account when making camera moving decisions.
Experimental results show our camera policy consistently improves the
performance of multi-object navigation over four baselines on two datasets.

paper, we propose a multi-granularity map, which contains both object
fine-grained details (e.g., color, texture) and semantic classes, to represent
objects more comprehensively. Moreover, we propose a weakly-supervised
auxiliary task, which requires the agent to localize instruction-relevant
objects on the map. Through this task, the agent not only learns to localize
the instruction-relevant objects for navigation but also is encouraged to learn
a better map representation that reveals object information. We then feed the

has been to fuse the place recognition estimates of multiple complementary VPR

approaches come with a substantial practical limitation: they require all
potential VPR methods to be brute-force run before they are selectively fused.
The obvious solution to this limitation is to predict the viable subset of
methods ahead of time, but this is challenging because it requires a predictive
signal within the imagery itself that is indicative of high performance
methods. Here we propose an alternative approach that instead starts with a
known single base VPR technique, and learns to predict the most complementary
additional VPR technique to fuse with it, that results in the largest
improvement in performance. The key innovation here is to use a dimensionally
reduced difference vector between the query image and the top-retrieved
reference image using this baseline technique as the predictive signal of the
most complementary additional technique, both during training and inference. We
demonstrate that our approach can train a single network to select performant,
complementary technique pairs across datasets which span multiple modes of

respect to the gravitational field, one in terms of the gravitational mass $m$

and the Einstein tensor. These formulae reproduce the well-known ones for the
prograde shift in the Schwarzschild spacetime. In a general case, the shift
deviates from that in the vacuum spacetime due to a particular combination of
the components of the Einstein tensor at the radius $r$ of the orbit. The
formulae give a retrograde shift due to the extended-mass effect in Newtonian
gravity. In general relativity, in the weak-field regime near a massive object,
the active gravitational mass density,
$\rho_{A}=(\epsilon+p_{r}+2p_{t})/c^{2}$, plays an important role, where
$\epsilon$, $p_{r}$, and $p_{t}$ are the energy density, the radial stress, and
the tangential stress of the matter field, respectively. We show that a
retrograde shift requires $\rho_{A}$ to be beyond a critical value
$\rho_{c}\simeq 2.8\times 10^{-15} \mbox{g}/\mbox{cm}^{3}
(m/M_{\odot})^{2}(r/\mbox{au})^{-4}$, while a prograde shift greater than that

problem as a bet. We then investigate an LRM's ability to choose outcomes that
have optimal, or at minimum, positive expected gain. Through a robust body of
experiments on four established LRMs, we show that a model is only able to
`think in bets' if it is first fine-tuned on bet questions with an identical
structure. Modifying the bet question's structure, while still retaining its
fundamental characteristics, decreases an LRM's performance by more than 25\%,
on average, although absolute performance remains well above random. LRMs are
also found to be more rational when selecting outcomes with non-negative
expected gain, rather than optimal or strictly positive expected gain. Our
results suggest that LRMs could potentially be applied to tasks that rely on
cognitive decision-making skills, but that more research is necessary before
they can robustly make rational decisions.

underlying physics is still not well understood. In this paper, we explore
granular column collapses using the spheropolyhedral discrete element method
(DEM), where the system contains two types of particles with different
frictional properties. We impose three different mixing ratios and multiple
different particle frictional coefficients, which lead to different run-out
distances and deposition heights. Based on our previous work and a simple
mixture theory, we propose a new effective initial aspect ratio for the
bi-frictional granular mixture, which helps unify the description of the
relative run-out distances. We analyze the kinematics of bi-frictional granular
column collapses and find that deviations from classical power-law scaling in
both the dimensionless terminal time and the dimensionless time when the system
reaches the maximum kinetic energy may result from differences in the initial
solid fraction and initial structures. To clarify the influence of initial
states, we further decrease the initial solid fraction of granular column
collapses, and propose a trial function to quantitatively describe its
influence. Due to the utilization of a simple mixture theory of contact
occurrence probability, this study can be associated with the
friction-dependent rheology of granular systems and friction-induced granular
segregations, and further generalized into applications with multiple species
of particles in various natural and engineering mixtures.

bridge) is an arc $e \in E$ whose removal makes the graph no longer strongly
connected. Equivalently, there exist $u,v \in V$, such that all $u$-$v$ walks
contain $e$. Cut arcs are a fundamental graph-theoretic notion, with countless
applications, especially in reachability problems.
  In this paper we initiate the study of cut paths, as a generalisation of cut
arcs, which we naturally define as those paths $P$ for which there exist $u,v
\in V$, such that all $u$-$v$ walks contain $P$ as subwalk. We first prove
various properties of cut paths and define their remainder structures, which we
use to present a simple $O(m)$-time verification algorithm for a cut path ($|V|
= n$, $|E| = m$).
  Secondly, we apply cut paths and their remainder structures to improve
several reachability problems from bioinformatics. A walk is called safe if it
is a subwalk of every node-covering closed walk of a strongly connected graph.
Multi-safety is defined analogously, by considering node-covering sets of
closed walks instead. We show that cut paths provide simple $O(m)$-time
algorithms verifying if a walk is safe or multi-safe. For multi-safety, we
present the first linear time algorithm, while for safety, we present a simple
algorithm where the state-of-the-art employed complex data structures. Finally
we show that the simultaneous computation of remainder structures of all
subwalks of a cut path can be performed in linear time. These properties yield
an $O(mn)$ algorithm outputting all maximal multi-safe walks, improving over
the state-of-the-art algorithm running in time $O(m^2+n^3)$.
  The results of this paper only scratch the surface in the study of cut paths,
and we believe a rich structure of a graph can be revealed, considering the
perspective of a path, instead of just an arc.

feasibility of exfiltrating data from a computer sitting in a Faraday cage by
exfiltrating data using magnetic fields. Although a large body of work has
recently emerged highlighting various physical covert channels, these attacks
have mostly targeted open-loop cyber-physical systems where the covert channels
exist on physical channels that are not being monitored by the victim. Network
architectures such as fog computing push sensitive data to cyber-physical edge
devices--whose physical side channels are typically monitored via state

existing cyber-physical models and infrastructure of individual devices to
exfiltrate data in a stealthy manner, i.e., we propose a method to circumvent
cyber-physical state estimation intrusion detection techniques while
exfiltrating sensitive data from the network. We propose a generalized model

We evaluate our approach on a distributed IoT network that includes computation

challenging: Even learning linear mixtures requires highly nontrivial
analytical tools, e.g., independent component analysis or nonnegative matrix
factorization. In this work, the post-nonlinear (PNL) mixture model -- where
unknown element-wise nonlinear functions are imposed onto a linear mixture --
is revisited. The PNL model is widely employed in different fields ranging from
brain signal classification, speech separation, remote sensing, to causal
discovery. To identify and remove the unknown nonlinear functions, existing
works often assume different properties on the latent components (e.g.,
statistical independence or probability-simplex structures).
  This work shows that under a carefully designed UML criterion, the existence
of a nontrivial null space associated with the underlying mixing system
suffices to guarantee identification/removal of the unknown nonlinearity.
Compared to prior works, our finding largely relaxes the conditions of
attaining PNL identifiability, and thus may benefit applications where no
strong structural information on the latent components is known. A
finite-sample analysis is offered to characterize the performance of the
proposed approach under realistic settings. To implement the proposed learning
criterion, a block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed. A series of

distinct. Beame, Clifford and Machmouchi (FOCS 2013) gave a low-space algorithm
for this problem running in space $S(n)$ and time $T(n)$ where $T(n) \le
\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2}/S(n)^{1/2})$, assuming a random oracle (i.e., random
access to polynomially many random bits). A recent breakthrough by Chen, Jin,
Williams and Wu (SODA 2022) showed how to remove the random oracle assumption
in the regime $S(n) = polylog(n)$ and $T(n) = \widetilde{O}(n^{3/2})$. They
designed the first truly $polylog(n)$-space, $\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2})$-time
algorithm by constructing a small family of hash functions $\mathcal{H}
\subseteq \{h | h:[poly(n)]\to [n]\}$ with a certain pseudorandom property.
  In this paper, we give a significantly simplified analysis of the
pseudorandom hash family by Chen et al. Our analysis clearly identifies the key
pseudorandom property required to fool the BCM algorithm, allowing us to
explore the full potential of this construction. As our main result, we show a
time-space tradeoff for Element Distinctness without random oracle. Namely, for
every $S(n),T(n)$ such that $T\approx \widetilde{O}(n^{3/2}/S(n)^{1/2})$, our
algorithm can solve the problem in space $S(n)$ and time $T(n)$. Our algorithm
also works for a related problem Set Intersection, for which this tradeoff is
tight due to a matching lower bound by Dinur (Eurocrypt 2020). As two
additional contributions, we show a more general pseudorandom property of the
hash family, and slightly improve the seed length to sample the pseudorandom

ordinary differential equations. By knowing the Darboux polynomials and its
cofactors, we extract the extended Prelle-Singer method's quantities without
evaluating the Prelle-Singer method's determining equations. We consider three
different cases of known Darboux polynomials. In the first case, we prove the
integrability of the given third-order nonlinear equation by utilizing the
Prelle-Singer method's quantifiers from the two known Darboux polynomials. If
we know only one Darboux polynomial, then the integrability of the given
equation will be dealt as case $2$. Likewise, case $3$ discuss the
integrability of the given system where we have two Darboux polynomials and one
set of Prelle-Singer method quantity. The established interconnection not only
helps in deriving the integrable quantifiers without solving the underlying
determining equations. It also provides a way to prove the complete
integrability and helps us in deriving the general solution of the given
equation. We demonstrate the utility of this procedure with three different
examples.

high-speed rotating blades provide power by sucking in air and fully
combusting, and various defects will inevitably occur, threatening the
operation safety of aero-engine. Therefore, regular inspections are essential
for such a complex system. However, existing traditional technology which is
borescope inspection is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and
experience-dependent. To endow this technology with intelligence, a novel
superpixel perception graph neural network (SPGNN) is proposed by utilizing a
multi-stage graph convolutional network (MSGCN) for feature extraction and
superpixel perception region proposal network (SPRPN) for region proposal.
First, to capture complex and irregular textures, the images are transformed
into a series of patches, to obtain their graph representations. Then, MSGCN
composed of several GCN blocks extracts graph structure features and performs
graph information processing at graph level. Last but not least, the SPRPN is
proposed to generate perceptual bounding boxes by fusing graph representation
features and superpixel perception features. Therefore, the proposed SPGNN
always implements feature extraction and information transmission at the graph
level in the whole SPGNN pipeline, and SPRPN and MSGNN mutually benefit from
each other. To verify the effectiveness of SPGNN, we meticulously construct a
simulated blade dataset with 3000 images. A public aluminum dataset is also
used to validate the performances of different methods. The experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed SPGNN has superior performance compared
with the state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be available at

defend against such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we provide the first

We find that pre-training and SGD optimizer are necessary for ViTs' adversarial

investigate its adversarial robustness from the perspective of its unique
architectural components. We find, when randomly masking gradients from some

corrections employed in our previous work. In addition, photometric zero-point
corrections are derived to provide an internally consistent photometric system
with a spatially uniform metallicity zero point. Using our phase-space
diagrams, we find a remarkably narrow sequence in the rotational velocity
($v_\phi$) versus metallicity ([Fe/H]) space for a sample of high proper-motion
stars ($>25$ mas yr$^{-1}$), which runs along Gaia Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) and
the Splash sub-structures, and is linked to the disk, spanning nearly $2$ dex
in [Fe/H]. Notably, a rapid increase of $v_\phi$ from a nearly zero net
rotation to $\sim180$ km s$^{-1}$ in a narrow metallicity interval ($-0.6 \leq$
[Fe/H] $\leq -0.4$) suggests that some of these stars emerged quickly on a
short gas-depletion time scale. Through measurements of a scale height and
length, we argue that these stars are distinct from those heated dynamically by
mergers. This chain of high proper-motion stars provides additional support for
recent findings that suggest a starburst occurred when the young Milky Way
encountered the gas-rich GSE progenitor, which eventually led to the settling

summaries to analyse spatial data across multiple scales. We introduce
hyperTDA, a topological pipeline that unifies local (e.g. geodesic) and global
(e.g. Euclidean) metrics without losing spatial information, even in the
presence of noise. Homology generators offer an elegant and flexible
description of spatial structures and can capture the information computed by
persistent homology in an interpretable way. Here the information computed by
persistent homology is transformed into a weighted hypergraph, where hyperedges
correspond to homology generators. We consider different choices of generators
(e.g. matroid or minimal) and find that centrality and community detection are
robust to either choice. We compare hyperTDA to existing geometric measures and
validate its robustness to noise. We demonstrate the power of computing
higher-order topological structures on spatial curves arising frequently in
ecology, biophysics, and biology, but also in high-dimensional financial
datasets. We find that hyperTDA can select between synthetic trajectories from
the landmark 2020 AnDi challenge and quantifies movements of different animal

detection. They reconstruct normal images from an input and compute the
difference between the predicted normal and the input. Unfortunately, STPM does
not have the ability to generate normal images. To improve the accuracy of
STPM, this work uses a student network, as in generative models, to reconstruct
normal features. This improves the accuracy; however, the anomaly maps for
normal images are not clean because STPM does not use anomaly images for
training, which decreases the accuracy of the image-level anomaly detection. To
further improve accuracy, a discriminative network trained with
pseudo-anomalies from anomaly maps is used in our method, which consists of two
pairs of student-teacher networks and a discriminative network. The method

needed to ensure a non-negative surplus process to avoid bankruptcy. Our
purpose is to characterize the optimal periodic dividend and capital injection

the total discounted costs of capital injection. To this end, we first consider
an auxiliary optimal periodic dividend and capital injection problem with final

the optimal strategy is a double barrier strategy. Using the fluctuation theory
and excursion-theoretical approach of the spectrally positive L\'evy process

are able to verify the conjecture that some double barrier periodic dividend

for the auxiliary control problem and a fixed point argument for recursive

become more expensive and resource-hungry. As a remedy, low-rank adapters
(LoRA) keep the main pretrained weights of the model frozen and just introduce
some learnable truncated SVD modules (so-called LoRA blocks) to the model.
While LoRA blocks are parameter-efficient, they suffer from two major problems:
first, the size of these blocks is fixed and cannot be modified after training
(for example, if we need to change the rank of LoRA blocks, then we need to
re-train them from scratch); second, optimizing their rank requires an
exhaustive search and effort. In this work, we introduce a dynamic low-rank
adaptation (DyLoRA) technique to address these two problems together. Our
DyLoRA method trains LoRA blocks for a range of ranks instead of a single rank
by sorting the representation learned by the adapter module at different ranks
during training. We evaluate our solution on different natural language
understanding (GLUE benchmark) and language generation tasks (E2E, DART and
WebNLG) using different pretrained models such as RoBERTa and GPT with
different sizes. Our results show that we can train dynamic search-free models
with DyLoRA at least 4 to 7 times (depending to the task) faster than LoRA
without significantly compromising performance. Moreover, our models can
perform consistently well on a much larger range of ranks compared to LoRA.

we take the first step towards a metric by identifying certain language

in a benchmark. We look for bias related parameters which can potentially help
pave our way towards the metric. We survey existing works and identify
parameters capturing various properties of bias, their origins, types and

is preserving the main context to guarantee retrieval quality. However, the
existing hashing methods have great limitations on suppressing redundant
background information and accurately encoding from Euclidean space to Hamming

Attention guided Information Extraction module (AIE) is introduced between two

global sliding windows. Unlike previous methods, our CSCE-Net learns a

single-stage costs or penalties as well depending on the state transitions. The
prescribed cost functions are responsible for mapping undesirable behavior at

days ahead. Making carpooling a viable option for daily commute is more
challenging, as trips are shorter and, proportionally, the detours tolerated by
drivers are more tight. As a consequence, finding riders and drivers sharing
close-enough origins, destinations and departure time is less likely, which
limits potential matching. In this paper we propose an Integrated System, where
carpooling matching is synchronized with Public Transit (PT) schedules, so as
to serve as a feeder service to PT in the first mile. Driver detours are
proposed towards PT selected stations, which are used as consolidation points,
thus increasing matching probability. We present a computationally efficient
method to represent PT schedules and drivers trajectory in a single General
Transit Feed Specification database, which allows to compute multimodal rider
journeys using any off the shelf planners. We showcase our approach in the
metropolitan area of Portland, Oregon, considering 8k randomly generated trips.
We show the benefits of our Integrated System. We find that 10% more riders
find a feasible matching with respect to the status quo, where carpooling and
PT are operated separately. We release our code as open source.

calculations when determining whether the minimum distance between two sets is
less than or equal to a certain threshold. We theoretically prove that the
complexity of GriT-DBSCAN is linear to the data set size. In addition, we
obtain two variants of GriT-DBSCAN by incorporating heuristics, or by combining
the second technique with an existing algorithm. Experiments are conducted on
both synthetic and real-world data sets to evaluate the efficiency of
GriT-DBSCAN and its variants. The results of our analyses show that our

intermediate highthroughput storage buffer layer to mitigate the I/O bottleneck
problem that the current High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms suffer. The
existing Markov-Chain based probabilistic I/O scheduling utilizes the load
state of Burst-Buffers and the periodical characteristics of applications to
reduce I/O congestion due to the limited capacity of Burst-Buffers. However,
this probabilistic approach requires consistent I/O characteristics of
applications, including similar I/O duration and long application length, in
order to obtain an accurate I/O load estimation. These consistency conditions
do not often hold in realistic situations.
  In this paper, we propose a generic framework of dynamic probabilistic I/O
scheduling based on application clustering (DPSAC) to make applications meet
the consistency requirements. According to the I/O phrase length of each
application, our scheme first deploys a one-dimensional K-means clustering
algorithm to cluster the applications into clusters. Next, it calculates the
expected workload of each cluster through the probabilistic model of
applications and then partitions the Burst-Buffers proportionally. Then, to
handle dynamic changes (join and exit) of applications, it updates the clusters
based on a heuristic strategy. Finally, it applies the probabilistic I/O
scheduling, which is based on the distribution of application workload and the
state of Burst-Buffers, to schedule I/O for all the concurrent applications to
mitigate I/O congestion. The simulation results on synthetic data show that our
DPSAC is effective and efficient.

""meta-task"" (e.g., textual entailment, question answering) then pretrain a
model on the combined meta dataset. The existing work is either pretrained on
specific subsets of classification tasks, or pretrained on both classification
and generation data but the model could not fulfill its potential in
universality and reliability. These also leave a massive amount of annotated
data under-exploited. To fill these gaps, we propose ConEntail, a new framework
for universal zero and few shot classification with supervised contrastive
pretraining. Our unified meta-task for classification is based on nested
entailment. It can be interpreted as ""Does sentence a entails [sentence b
entails label c]"". This formulation enables us to make better use of 57
annotated classification datasets for supervised contrastive pretraining and
universal evaluation. In this way, ConEntail helps the model (1) absorb

that visits each point exactly once, which is equivalent to solving a Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP). The path is simplified with fewer points using bounded
approximation and smoothed and optimized using B\'ezier spline curves with
bounded curvature. Our robotic drawing system consisting of single or dual

observations resolve a network of core-connecting dust lanes, marking a
departure from earlier coarser more spherical continuum structures. At the same
time, the cores do not appear to fragment further. Polarized dust emission is
clearly detected. The inferred magnetic field orientations are prevailingly
parallel to dust lanes. This key structural feature is analyzed together with
the local gravitational vector field. The direction of local gravity is found
to typically align with dust lanes. With these findings we derive a stability
criterion that defines a maximum magnetic field strength that can be overcome
by an observed magnetic field-gravity configuration. Equivalently, this defines
a minimum field strength that can stabilize dust lanes against a radial
collapse. We find that the detected dust lanes in W51 e2 and e8 are stable,
hence possibly making them a fundamental component in the accretion onto
central sources, providing support for massive star formation models without
the need of large accretion disks. When comparing to coarser resolutions,
covering the scales of envelope, global, and local collapse, we find recurring
similarities in the magnetic field structures and their corresponding

multi-scale collapse-within-collapse scenario until finally the scale of
core-accreting dust lanes is reached where gravity is entraining the magnetic

adversarial network to construct a novel end-to-end image dehaze model. We
adopt outdoor image datasets to train our model, which includes a set of
real-world unpaired image dataset and a set of paired image dataset to ensure
that the generated images are close to the real scene. Based on the cycle

the effect including adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss, photorealism
loss and paired L1 loss. These four constraints can improve the overall quality
of such degraded images for better visual appeal and ensure reconstruction of

remote sensing image (RSI) super-resolution (SR). However, increasing network
depth and parameters cause a huge burden of computing and storage. Directly
reducing the depth or width of existing models results in a large performance
drop. We observe that the SR difficulty of different regions in an RSI varies
greatly, and existing methods use the same deep network to process all regions
in an image, resulting in a waste of computing resources. In addition, existing
SR methods generally predefine integer scale factors and cannot perform
stepless SR, i.e., a single model can deal with any potential scale factor.
Retraining the model on each scale factor wastes considerable computing
resources and model storage space. To address the above problems, we propose a
saliency-aware dynamic routing network (SalDRN) for lightweight and stepless SR
of RSIs. First, we introduce visual saliency as an indicator of region-level SR
difficulty and integrate a lightweight saliency detector into the SalDRN to
capture pixel-level visual characteristics. Then, we devise a saliency-aware
dynamic routing strategy that employs path selection switches to adaptively
select feature extraction paths of appropriate depth according to the SR
difficulty of sub-image patches. Finally, we propose a novel lightweight
stepless upsampling module whose core is an implicit feature function for
realizing mapping from low-resolution feature space to high-resolution feature
space. Comprehensive experiments verify that the SalDRN can achieve a good
trade-off between performance and complexity. The code is available at

choosing quadratures depending on the intersection between non-conforming

ease of implementation are reported for point-to-point interpolation. However,
we show that this approach can not safely be used for DG discretizations of the

oscillations that lead to instabilities. This work presents a test case in that
we can observe the instabilities and shows that exact integration is required
to maintain a stable method. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of
the method with exact integration. We show optimal spatial convergence rates
globally and in each mesh region separately. The method is constructed such
that it can natively treat overlaps between elements. Finally, we highlight the

Such polaritons based on plasmons are rare and only experimentally revealed

in nanophotonics. Different from phonon polaritons, hyperbolic plasmons
originate from the interplay of free carrier Drude response and interband

is tuned in a wide range, with frequencies from 429 cm-1 (23 microns) for pure
WTe2 to 270 cm-1 (37 microns) at the 50% Mo-doping level. Surprisingly, the
localized plasmon in skew ribbons shows unusual polarization dependence,
accurately manifesting its topology, which renders a reliable means to track
the topology with far-field techniques. Our results open an avenue for
reconfigurable photonic devices capable of plasmon polariton steering, such as

performance compared to NNs is not satisfactory. Heterophily has been
considered the main cause of this empirical observation and numerous works have
been put forward to address it. In this paper, we first revisit the widely used
homophily metrics and point out that their consideration of only graph-label
consistency is a shortcoming. Then, we study heterophily from the perspective
of post-aggregation node similarity and define new homophily metrics, which are
potentially advantageous compared to existing ones. Based on this
investigation, we prove that some harmful cases of heterophily can be
effectively addressed by local diversification operation. Then, we propose the
Adaptive Channel Mixing (ACM), a framework to adaptively exploit aggregation,
diversification and identity channels node-wisely to extract richer localized
information for diverse node heterophily situations. ACM is more powerful than
the commonly used uni-channel framework for node classification tasks on
heterophilic graphs and is easy to be implemented in baseline GNN layers. When
evaluated on 10 benchmark node classification tasks, ACM-augmented baselines
consistently achieve significant performance gain, exceeding state-of-the-art

progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Recently, a new version of the SD
model, the common-envelope wind (CEW) model, has been proposed, which, in
principle, has the potential to resolve most of the difficulties encountered by
previous SD models. This model is still being developed and a number of open
issues remain, such as the details of the mass-loss mechanism from the surface
of the common envelope (CE), the main observational properties, and the
spiral-in timescale of the binary inside the envelope. In this article, we aim
to address these issues by considering hydrodynamical effects on the CE. Using
the stellar evolution code MESA, we carried out a series of 1D hydrodynamical
simulations of an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star undergoing a
common-envelope phase with different envelope masses (0.0007-0.06 solar mass).
We found that the envelopes are always dynamically unstable, leading to regular
mass ejection events if the envelope is more massive than the critical value of
~ 0.003 solar mass. The kappa mechanism can naturally explain this phenomenon.
We also found that, due to the low mass of the CE, the estimated frictional
luminosity caused by the spiral-in of the immersed binary is much less than the
nuclear luminosity, and therefore will not affect the structure of the CE
significantly. Our results imply that the CE in the CEW model cannot be very
massive. We also present a rough estimate for the spiral-in timescale based on
a simplified model. We found that, for reasonable assumptions, the timescale
may be longer than a few 100,000 yr; therefore, the white dwarf may have enough
time to increase its mass toward the Chandrasekhar mass, avoiding a merger with
the companion.

  problem","49 pp, 8 figures",,,,"math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The function $\inf_n nx^{1/n}$ has the asymptotics $eu+e
d^2(u)/(2u)+O(1/u^2)$ as $x\to\infty$, where $u=\log x$ and $d(u)$ is the
distance from $u$ to the nearest integer. We generalize this observation.
  First, the curves $y=nx^{1/n}$ can be written parametrically as $\log x=nt$,
$y=nt$. In general, let $(u_n(t),v_n(t))$ be a family of parametric curves with
asymptotics $u_n=n p_1(t)+q_1(t)+r_1(t)/n+O(1/n^2)$ and $v_n=n
p_2(t)+q_2(t)+r_2(t)/n+O(1/n^2)$. Suppose the function $p_1(t)/p_0(t)$ has a
unique nondegenerate minimum in the parameter domain. It is shown that the
asymptotics of their lower envelope $v(u)=\inf_{n,t} v_n(t)$, where $u=u_n(t)$,
has the asymptotics of the form $v(u)=a_0 u+a_1+\Phi(u)/u+O(1/u^2)$, where
$\Phi$ is an affinely transformed function $d^2(\cdot)$.
  Second, note that $nx^{1/n}$ is the minimum of the sum
$t_1+t_2/t_1+\dots+t_{n}/t_{n-1}$ subject to the constraint $t_n=x$. We
consider a similar asymptotic problem for the sums
$t_1+t_2/(t_1+1)+\dots+t_n/(t_{n-1}+1)$. Let $F_n(x)$ is the minimum value of
the $n$-term sum under the constraint $t_n=x$. Define $F(x)=\inf_n F_n(x)$. We
show that $F(x)=eu-A+e d^2(u+b)/(2u)+O(1/u^2)$ with certain numerical constants
$A$ and $b$. We present alternative forms of this optimization problem, in
particular, a ``least action'' formulation. Also we find the asymptotics
$F_n^{(p)}(x)=e\log n-A(p)+O(1/\log n)$ for the function arising from the sums
with denominators of the form $t_j+p$ with arbitrary $p>0$ and establish some
facts about the function $A(p)$.

  Learning","14 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  One of the key challenges in federated learning (FL) is local data
distribution heterogeneity across clients, which may cause inconsistent feature
spaces across clients. To address this issue, we propose a novel method FedFM,
which guides each client's features to match shared category-wise anchors
(landmarks in feature space). This method attempts to mitigate the negative
effects of data heterogeneity in FL by aligning each client's feature space.
Besides, we tackle the challenge of varying objective function and provide
convergence guarantee for FedFM. In FedFM, to mitigate the phenomenon of
overlapping feature spaces across categories and enhance the effectiveness of
feature matching, we further propose a more precise and effective feature
matching loss called contrastive-guiding (CG), which guides each local feature
to match with the corresponding anchor while keeping away from
non-corresponding anchors. Additionally, to achieve higher efficiency and
flexibility, we propose a FedFM variant, called FedFM-Lite, where clients
communicate with server with fewer synchronization times and communication
bandwidth costs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FedFM with
CG outperforms several works by quantitative and qualitative comparisons.
FedFM-Lite can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods with
five to ten times less communication costs.

that, despite numerous measurements in a series of experiments, there is still
no experimental proof of the entanglement of annihilation photons. These

photon number and optical phase when the photon number is small. However we
show that a new problem appears when integrating with the field equations: the
variance of the optical phase becomes divergent. This divergence can not be
observed with the numerical integration of the commonly used equations for
photon number and optical phase because of the previous instabilities. The
divergence of the phase variance means that this quantity does not reach a
fixed value as the integration time step is decreased. We obtain that the phase
variance increases as the integration time step decreases with no sign of
saturation behaviour even for tiny steps. We explain the divergence by making
the analogy of our problem with the 2-dimensional Brownian motion. The fact
that the divergence appears is not surprising because already in 1940 Paul
L\`evy demonstrated that the variance of the polar angle in a 2-dimensional
Brownian motion is a divergent quantity. Our results show that stochastic rate
equations for photon number and phase are not appropriated for describing the
phase statistics when the photon number is small. Simulation of the stochastic
rate equations for the electrical field are consistent with L\`evy's results

its labeling. The response to such limitations is usually augmenting the
dataset with more annotations per data point; however, this is not possible
when we are interested in self-reports via first-person annotation. Moreover,
outlier detection methods based on inter-annotator agreement only consider the
annotations themselves and ignore the context and the corresponding affect
manifestation. This paper reframes the ways one may obtain a reliable ground
truth of affect by transferring aspects of causation theory to affective
computing. In particular, we assume that the ground truth of affect can be

condensed matter physics. It is intriguing to explore the interplay between
these phenomena in a single quantum material. Here, using the prototypical

how momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling drives the CDW transition from
$3\times3$ to $2\times2$ phase under electron doping. More interestingly, we
find the coexistence of superconductivity and nontrivial topology in one of the
two $2\times2$ CDW phases, the latter of which is identified by the nonzero
Z$_2$ invariant with ideal Dirac cone edge states near the Fermi level. A
similar CDW transition-induced topological superconductor has also been
confirmed in monolayer 1H-TaSe$_2$. Our findings not only reveal a unique and
general method to introduce nontrivial topology by CDW transition, but also
provide an ideal platform to modulate different quantum orders by electron
doping, thus stimulating experimental interest.

budgets, incurred by different applications/devices, is essential for deploying
deep models in real-world applications. To achieve this goal, existing methods
often perform an independent architecture search process for each target
budget, which is very inefficient yet unnecessary. More critically, these
independent search processes cannot share their learned knowledge (i.e., the
distribution of good architectures) with each other and thus often result in
limited search results. To address these issues, we propose a Pareto-aware
Neural Architecture Generator (PNAG) which only needs to be trained once and
dynamically produces the Pareto optimal architecture for any given budget via
inference. To train our PNAG, we learn the whole Pareto frontier by jointly
finding multiple Pareto optimal architectures under diverse budgets. Such a
joint search algorithm not only greatly reduces the overall search cost but
also improves the search results. Extensive experiments on three hardware
platforms (i.e., mobile device, CPU, and GPU) show the superiority of our
method over existing methods.

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-agent reinforcement learning has drawn increasing attention in
practice, e.g., robotics and automatic driving, as it can explore optimal
policies using samples generated by interacting with the environment. However,
high reward uncertainty still remains a problem when we want to train a
satisfactory model, because obtaining high-quality reward feedback is usually
expensive and even infeasible. To handle this issue, previous methods mainly
focus on passive reward correction. At the same time, recent active reward
estimation methods have proven to be a recipe for reducing the effect of reward
uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel Distributional Reward Estimation
framework for effective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DRE-MARL). Our main
idea is to design the multi-action-branch reward estimation and policy-weighted
reward aggregation for stabilized training. Specifically, we design the
multi-action-branch reward estimation to model reward distributions on all
action branches. Then we utilize reward aggregation to obtain stable updating
signals during training. Our intuition is that consideration of all possible
consequences of actions could be useful for learning policies. The superiority
of the DRE-MARL is demonstrated using benchmark multi-agent scenarios, compared
with the SOTA baselines in terms of both effectiveness and robustness.

semi-conducting structure of borophene. It has been found that when an

spin splitting occurs for both spin-up and spin-down states in specific ranges
of energy. Therefore, the spin polarization of current could be controlled by
adjusting the energy of incoming electrons by means of an external back-gate
voltage. We focus on the edge manipulation of $\alpha^{\prime}$-BNR by
ferro-magnetic (FM) or anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) exchange field which leads to
the emergence of a giant magneto resistance and a perfect spin filtering. Local
current provides the best picture of spin distribution of current in the
nanoribbon. In order to observe the response of the system to the proximity
effect of magnetic strips, we calculate the magnetic moment of each site. Then,
we show that applying a transverse or perpendicular electric field in the
presence of the exchange magnetic field gives another controlling tool on the
spin polarization of current in a constant energy. Finally, by simultaneous
effect of in-plane and out-of-plane exchange magnetic field on the edges of
nanoribbon, we reach a control on spin rotation in the scattering region. Our
investigation guarantees the $\alpha^{\prime}$-BNR as a promising two

piano playing problem, in which an algorithm needs to compute the trajectories
for a dynamically sized team of robots who will play the musical notes by
traveling through the specific locations associated with musical notes at their
respective specific times. A two-step dynamic resource allocation based on a
spatio-temporal multi-task assignment problem (DREAM), has been implemented to
assign robots for playing the musical tune. The algorithm computes the required
number of robots to play the music in the first step. In the second step,
optimal assignments are computed for the updated team of robots, which
minimizes the total distance traveled by the team. Even for the individual
feasible trajectories, the multi-robot execution may fail if robots encounter a
collision. As some time will be utilized for this conflict resolution, robots
may not be able to reach the desired location on time. This paper analyses and
proves that, if robots are operating in a convex region, the solution of the
DREAM approach provides collision-free trajectories. The working of the DREAM
approach has been illustrated with the help of the high fidelity simulations in
Gazebo operated using ROS2. The result clearly shows that the DREAM approach
computes the required number of robots and assigns multiple tasks to robots in

Since the majority of the earth's surface is constantly covered with clouds,
which are not transparent at these wavelengths, many images do not provide much
information. To increase the temporal availability of cloud-free images of a
certain area, one can combine the observations from multiple sources. However,
the sensors of satellites might differ in their properties, making the images
incompatible. This work provides a first glance at the possibility of using a
transformer-based model to reduce the spectral and spatial differences between
observations from both satellite projects. We compare the results to a model

search for parity-violating processes like that predicted by a Chern-Simons
coupling to a light pseudoscalar field. Such an interaction rotates $E$ modes
into $B$ modes in the observed CMB signal by an effect known as cosmic
birefringence. Even though isotropic birefringence can be confused with the
rotation produced by a miscalibration of the detectors' polarization angles the
degeneracy between both effects is broken when Galactic foreground emission is
used as a calibrator. In this work, we use realistic simulations of the
High-Frequency Instrument of the Planck mission to test the impact that
Galactic foreground emission and instrumental systematics have on the recent
birefringence measurements obtained through this technique. Our results
demonstrate the robustness of the methodology against the miscalibration of
polarization angles and other systematic effects, like
intensity-to-polarization leakage, beam leakage, or cross-polarization effects.
However, our estimator is sensitive to the $EB$ correlation of polarized
foreground emission. Here we propose to correct the bias induced by dust $EB$
by modeling the foreground signal with templates produced in Bayesian
component-separation analyses that fit parametric models to CMB data.
Acknowledging the limitations of currently available dust templates like that
of the Commander sky model, high-precision CMB data and a characterization of
dust beyond the modified blackbody paradigm are needed to obtain a definitive
measurement of cosmic birefringence in the future.

essential for many applications, such as robotic manipulation. However,
learning a policy that can generalize to unseen tasks is challenging. In this
work, we propose to achieve one-shot task generalization by decoupling plan
generation and plan execution. Specifically, our method solves complex
long-horizon tasks in three steps: build a paired abstract environment by
simplifying geometry and physics, generate abstract trajectories, and solve the
original task by an abstract-to-executable trajectory translator. In the
abstract environment, complex dynamics such as physical manipulation are
removed, making abstract trajectories easier to generate. However, this
introduces a large domain gap between abstract trajectories and the actual
executed trajectories as abstract trajectories lack low-level details and are
not aligned frame-to-frame with the executed trajectory. In a manner
reminiscent of language translation, our approach leverages a seq-to-seq model
to overcome the large domain gap between the abstract and executable
trajectories, enabling the low-level policy to follow the abstract trajectory.
Experimental results on various unseen long-horizon tasks with different robot
embodiments demonstrate the practicability of our methods to achieve one-shot
task generalization.

test these efficient methods' capability on long-range modeling is Long Range
Arena (LRA). However, LRA only focuses on the standard bidirectional (or
noncausal) self attention, and completely ignores cross attentions and
unidirectional (or causal) attentions, which are equally important to
downstream applications. Although designing cross and causal variants of an
attention method is straightforward for vanilla attention, it is often
challenging for efficient attentions with subquadratic time and memory
complexity. In this paper, we propose Comprehensive Attention Benchmark (CAB)
under a fine-grained attention taxonomy with four distinguishable attention
patterns, namely, noncausal self, causal self, noncausal cross, and causal
cross attentions. CAB collects seven real-world tasks from different research
areas to evaluate efficient attentions under the four attention patterns. Among
these tasks, CAB validates efficient attentions in eight backbone networks to
show their generalization across neural architectures. We conduct exhaustive
experiments to benchmark the performances of nine widely-used efficient
attention architectures designed with different philosophies on CAB. Extensive
experimental results also shed light on the fundamental problems of efficient
attentions, such as efficiency length against vanilla attention, performance
consistency across attention patterns, the benefit of attention mechanisms, and

Given $M=G/K$ with $G$ compact semisimple, we first show that each bi-invariant

$3$-form $Q([\cdot,\cdot],\cdot)$ on the compact Lie group $G$. Indeed, every
class in $H^3(G/K)$ has a unique representative $H_Q$. Secondly, focusing on
the class of homogeneous spaces with the richest third cohomology (other than
Lie groups), i.e., $b_3(G/K)=s-1$ if $G$ has $s$ simple factors, we give the
conditions to be fulfilled by $Q$ and a given $G$-invariant metric $g$ in order
for $H_Q$ to be $g$-harmonic, in terms of algebraic invariants of $G/K$. As an
application, we obtain that any $3$-form $H_Q$ is harmonic with respect to the
standard metric, although for any other normal metric, there is only one $H_Q$
up to scaling which is harmonic. Furthermore, among a suitable
$(2s-1)$-parameter family of $G$-invariant metrics, we prove that the same

unique $g$-harmonic $3$-form $H_Q$ (up to scaling). In the case when

particles have non-zero mass and oscillate between their three flavors when
they propagate. In the 2010's, similar anomalies observed in the antineutrino
spectra emitted by nuclear reactors have triggered the hypothesis of the
existence of a supplementary neutrino state that would be sterile i.e. not
interacting via the weak interaction. The STEREO experiment was designed to
study this scientific case that would potentially extend the Standard Model of
Particle Physics. Here we present a complete study based on our full set of
data with significantly improved sensitivity. Installed at the ILL (Institut
Laue Langevin) research reactor, STEREO has accurately measured the
antineutrino energy spectrum associated to the fission of 235U. This
measurement confirms the anomalies whereas, thanks to the segmentation of the
STEREO detector and its very short mean distance to the core (10~m), the same
data reject the hypothesis of a light sterile neutrino. Such a direct
measurement of the antineutrino energy spectrum suggests instead that biases in
the nuclear experimental data used for the predictions are at the origin of the
anomalies. Our result supports the neutrino content of the Standard Model and
establishes a new reference for the 235U antineutrino energy spectrum. We
anticipate that this result will allow to progress towards finer tests of the
fundamental properties of neutrinos but also to benchmark models and nuclear
data of interest for reactor physics and for observations of astrophysical or
geo-neutrinos.

structures in the turbulent mixing region and near pressure field of high-speed
jets. For perfectly-expanded single round jets, these models predict the
dominance of $m=0$ and $m = 1$ helical modes for the lower frequency range, in
agreement with empirical data. When LST is applied to twin-jet systems, four
solution families appear following the odd/even behaviour of the pressure field
about the symmetry planes. The interaction between the unsteady pressure fields
of the two jets also results in their coupling. The individual modes of the
different solution families no longer correspond to helical motions, but to
flapping oscillations of the jet plumes. In the limit of large jet separations,
when the jet coupling vanishes, the eigenvalues corresponding to the $m=1$ mode
in each family are identical, and a linear combination of them recovers the
helical motion. Conversely, as the jet separation decreases, the eigenvalues
for the $m=1$ modes of each family diverge, thus favouring a particular
flapping oscillation over the others and preventing the appearance of helical
motions. The dominant mode of oscillation for a given jet Mach number $M_j$ and
temperature ratio $T_R$ depends on the Strouhal number $St$ and jet separation
$s$. Increasing both $M_j$ and $T_R$ independently is found to augment the jet
coupling and modify the $(St,s)$ map of the preferred oscillation mode. Present
results predict the preference of two modes when the jet interaction is
relevant, namely varicose and especially sinuous flapping oscillations on the
nozzles plane.

It is based on the approximation of the integral representation of the

required actions by means of $\mu$-mode products involving exponentials of the
small sized matrices $A_\mu$, without using the large sized matrix $K$ itself.
PHIKS, which profits from the highly efficient level 3 BLAS, is designed to
compute different $\varphi$-functions applied on the same vector or a linear
combination of actions of $\varphi$-functions applied on different vectors. In
addition, due to the underlying scaling and squaring technique, the desired
quantities are available simultaneously at suitable time scales. All these
features allow the effective usage of PHIKS in the exponential integration

that the anomalous Hall effect in the Mn2CoAl is primarily governed by
intrinsic mechanism due to the Berry curvature in momentum space. The

that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the overall system is limited by the

damping in the presence of velocity birefringence, when parity symmetry is
explicitly broken. In particular, we analyze the role of the Nieh-Yan and
Chern-Simons terms in modified theories of gravity, showing how the
gravitational perturbation in collisionless media can be characterized by a
subluminal phase velocity, circumventing the well-known results of General
Relativity and allowing for the appearance of the kinematic damping. We
investigate in detail the connection between the thermodynamic properties of
the medium, such as temperature and mass of the particles interacting with the
gravitational wave, and the parameters ruling the parity violating terms of the
models. In this respect, we outline how the dispersion relations can give rise
in each model to different regions of the wavenumber space, where the phase
velocity is subluminal, superluminal or does not exist. Quantitative estimates
on the considered models indicate that the phenomenon of Landau damping is not
detectable given the sensitivity of present-day instruments.

system control. Its standard implementation relies on measuring the state of a
system, processing the classical signal, and feeding it back to the system. In
quantum physics, however, measurements not only read out the state of the
system but also modify it irreversibly. Coherent feedback is a different kind
of feedback that coherently processes and feeds back quantum signals without
actually measuring the system. Here, we report on the experimental realization
and the theoretical analysis of an optical coherent feedback platform to
control the motional state of a nanomechanical membrane in an optical cavity.
The coherent feedback loop consists of a light field interacting twice with the
same mechanical mode through different cavity modes, without {performing any}
measurement. Tuning the optical phase and delay of the feedback loop allows us
to control the motional state of the mechanical oscillator, its resonance
frequency and also its damping rate, which we use to cool the membrane close to
the quantum ground state. Our theoretical analysis provides the optimal cooling
conditions, showing that this new technique enables ground-state cooling.
Experimentally, we show that we can cool the membrane to a state with
$\bar{n}_m = 4.89 \pm 0.14 $ phonons (${480}\,{\mu \mathrm{K}}$) in a
${20}\,\mathrm{K}$ environment. This lies below the theoretical limit of cavity
dynamical backaction cooling in the unresolved sideband regime and is achieved
with only 1$\%$ of the optical power required for cavity cooling. Our feedback
scheme is very versatile, offering new opportunities for quantum control in a
variety of optomechanical systems.

histology, normal samples are usually abundant, whereas anomalous
(pathological) cases are scarce or not available. Under such settings,
one-class classifiers trained on healthy data can detect out-of-distribution
anomalous samples. Such approaches combined with pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) representations of images were previously employed for
anomaly detection (AD). However, pre-trained off-the-shelf CNN representations
may not be sensitive to abnormal conditions in tissues, while natural
variations of healthy tissue may result in distant representations. To adapt
representations to relevant details in healthy tissue we propose training a CNN
on an auxiliary task that discriminates healthy tissue of different species,
organs, and staining reagents. Almost no additional labeling workload is
required, since healthy samples come automatically with aforementioned labels.
During training we enforce compact image representations with a center-loss
term, which further improves representations for AD. The proposed system
outperforms established AD methods on a published dataset of liver anomalies.
Moreover, it provided comparable results to conventional methods specifically
tailored for quantification of liver anomalies. We show that our approach can
be used for toxicity assessment of candidate drugs at early development stages
and thereby may reduce expensive late-stage drug attrition.

remarkable modulations in the one-body density profile. Depending on the shear
magnitude, particles accumulate either in quiescent regions or in the vicinity
of maximum net flow, and we deduce this strong non-equilibrium response to be
characteristic of the gel state. Studying the components of the internal force
parallel and perpendicular to the flow direction reveals that the emerging flow
and structure of the stationary state are driven by significant viscous and
structural superadiabatic forces. Thereby, the magnitude and nature of the
observed non-equilibrium phenomena differs from the corresponding behavior of
simple fluids. We demonstrate that a simple power functional theory reproduces
accurately the viscous force profile, giving a rationale of the complex

reasoning about future trajectories over a longer time horizon. Intuitively,
the longer the occlusion gap, the larger the search space for possible

electronics, and sensing applications, especially when it does not saturate
over a wide range of magnetic fields. One of its principal origins is local
mobility or density inhomogeneities, often structural, which in the
Parish-Littlewood theory leads to an unsaturating LMR proportional to mobility.
Structural disorder, however, also tends to limit the mobility and hence the
overall LMR amplitude. An alternative route to achieve large LMR is via
non-structural inhomogeneities which do not affect the zero field mobility,
like magnetic domains. Here, linear positive magnetoresistance caused by
magnetic texture is reported in \ch{LaTiO3}/\ch{SrTiO3} heterostructures. The
LMR amplitude reaches up to 6500\% at 9T. This colossal value is understood by
the unusual combination of a very high thin film mobility, up to 40 000
cm$^2$/V.s, and a very large coverage of low-mobility regions. These regions
correlate with a striped magnetic structure, compatible with a spiral magnetic
texture in the \ch{LaTiO3} film, revealed by low temperature Lorentz
transmission electron microscopy. These results provide a novel route for the
engineering of large-LMR devices.

constructing a fully differentiable model of metasurface-based hyperspectral

spin-polarized alkali and noble gases (for example K-$^3$He) are promising
sensors for exotic beyond-the-standard-model fields and high-precision
metrology such as rotation sensing. When the comagnetometer operates in the
so-called self-compensated regime, the effective field, originating from
contact interactions between the alkali valence electrons and the noble-gas
nuclei, is compensated with an applied magnetic field. When the comagnetometer
begins operation in a given magnetic field, spin-exchange optical pumping
establishes equilibrium between the alkali electron-spin polarization and the
nuclear-spin polarization. Subsequently, when the magnetic field is tuned to
the compensation point, the spin polarization is brought out of the equilibrium
conditions. This causes a practical issue for long measurement times. We report
on a novel method for closed-loop control of the compensation field. This
method allows optimization of the operating parameters, especially magnetic
field gradients, in spite of the inherently slow (hours to days) dynamics of
the system. With the optimization, higher stable nuclear polarization, longer
relaxation times and stronger electron-nuclear coupling are achieved which is
useful for nuclear-spin-based quantum memory, spin amplifiers and gyroscopes.
The optimized sensor demonstrates a sensitivity comparable to the best previous
comagnetometer but with four times lower noble gas density. This paves the way
for applications in both fundamental and applied science.

state-of-the-art MicroController Unit (MCU), with 1+8 general-purpose RISC-V
cores. To achieve low-latency execution, we propose an optimized software
pipeline interleaving parallel computation of LSTM or GRU recurrent blocks,
featuring vectorized 8-bit integer (INT8) and 16-bit floating-point (FP16)
compute units, with manually-managed memory transfers of model parameters. To
ensure minimal accuracy degradation with respect to the full-precision models,
we propose a novel FP16-INT8 Mixed-Precision Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)
scheme that compresses the recurrent layers to 8-bit while the bit precision of
remaining layers is kept to FP16. Experiments are conducted on multiple LSTM
and GRU based SE models trained on the Valentini dataset, featuring up to 1.24M
parameters. Thanks to the proposed approaches, we speed-up the computation by
up to 4x with respect to the lossless FP16 baselines. Differently from a
uniform 8-bit quantization that degrades the PESQ score by 0.3 on average, the
Mixed-Precision PTQ scheme leads to a low-degradation of only 0.06, while
achieving a 1.4-1.7x memory saving. Thanks to this compression, we cut the
power cost of the external memory by fitting the large models on the limited
on-chip non-volatile memory and we gain a MCU power saving of up to 2.5x by
reducing the supply voltage from 0.8V to 0.65V while still matching the
real-time constraints. Our design results 10x more energy efficient than
state-of-the-art SE solutions deployed on single-core MCUs that make use of
smaller models and quantization-aware training.

proxy tasks in different branches to detect video anomalies in different

effectively cover all motion patterns, or the class of the objects is not
explicitly considered. To address the aforementioned shortcomings, we propose a
novel multi-task learning based method that combines complementary proxy tasks
to better consider the motion and appearance features. We combine the semantic
segmentation and future frame prediction tasks in a single branch to learn the
object class and consistent motion patterns, and to detect respective anomalies
simultaneously. In the second branch, we added several attention mechanisms to
detect motion anomalies with attention to object parts, the direction of
motion, and the distance of the objects from the camera. Our qualitative
results show that the proposed method considers the object class effectively

results in a precise motion modeling and a better motion anomaly detection.
Additionally, quantitative results show the superiority of our method compared

attempt to jointly solve an optimization task over some data distribution. We
essentially show that, under reasonable parameter settings, such a system can
not only withstand noisier zeroth-order agents but can even benefit from
integrating such agents into the optimization process, rather than ignoring

to avoid normal nodes being isolated from the network permanently due to error

reprocessed VLA data at 1.6 GHz (L-band) from the Continuum Halos in Nearby
Galaxies - an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES) enable us to increase the extent of the
analysed radio continuum profile significantly (up to a factor of 2) compared
to previous studies. We compute thermal emission maps using a mixture approach
of H-alpha and near infrared data, which is then subtracted to yield radio
synchrotron emission maps. Then we compile non-thermal spectral index maps and
compute intensity profiles using a box integration approach. Lastly, we perform
1D cosmic ray transport modelling. The non-thermal spectral index maps show
evidence that the LoTSS maps are affected by thermal absorption, in star
forming regions. The scale height analysis reveals that most of the galaxies
are equally well fitted with an one-component instead of a twocomponent
exponential profile. We find a bi-modality within our sample. While NGC 3432

classification of temporal data are shifting from single-channel datasets
(univariate) to problems with multiple channels of information (multivariate).
The majority of these works are focused on the method novelty and architecture,
and the format of the input data is often treated implicitly. Particularly,
multivariate datasets are often treated as a stack of univariate time series in
terms of input preprocessing, with scaling methods applied across each channel
separately. In this evaluation, we aim to demonstrate that the additional
channel dimension is far from trivial and different approaches to scaling can
lead to significantly different results in the accuracy of a solution. To that
end, we test seven different data transformation methods on four different
temporal dimensions and study their effect on the classification accuracy of
five recent methods. We show that, for the large majority of tested datasets,
the best transformation-dimension configuration leads to an increase in the
accuracy compared to the result of each model with the same hyperparameters and
no scaling, ranging from 0.16 to 76.79 percentage points. We also show that if
we keep the transformation method constant, there is a statistically
significant difference in accuracy results when applying it across different
dimensions, with accuracy differences ranging from 0.23 to 47.79 percentage
points. Finally, we explore the relation of the transformation methods and
dimensions to the classifiers, and we conclude that there is no prominent
general trend, and the optimal configuration is dataset- and
classifier-specific.

Networks (DNNs) with multiple data sources from different clients. Instead of
sharing the data, each client trains the model locally, resulting in improved
privacy. However, recently so-called targeted poisoning attacks have been
proposed that allow individual clients to inject a backdoor into the trained
model. Existing defenses against these backdoor attacks either rely on
techniques like Differential Privacy to mitigate the backdoor, or analyze the
weights of the individual models and apply outlier detection methods that
restricts these defenses to certain data distributions. However, adding noise
to the models' parameters or excluding benign outliers might also reduce the
accuracy of the collaboratively trained model. Additionally, allowing the
server to inspect the clients' models creates a privacy risk due to existing
knowledge extraction methods. We propose CrowdGuard, a model filtering defense,
that mitigates backdoor attacks by leveraging the clients' data to analyze the
individual models before the aggregation. To prevent data leaks, the server
sends the individual models to secure enclaves, running in client-located
Trusted Execution Environments. To effectively distinguish benign and poisoned
models, even if the data of different clients are not independently and
identically distributed (non-IID), we introduce a novel metric called HLBIM to
analyze the outputs of the DNN's hidden layers. We show that the applied
significance-based detection algorithm combined can effectively detect poisoned
models, even in non-IID scenarios. We show in our extensive evaluation that
CrowdGuard can effectively mitigate targeted poisoning attacks and achieve in
various scenarios a True-Positive-Rate of 100% and a True-Negative-Rate of
100%.

different data location sites, we propose a distributed version of a row-wise
tensor product that allows the computation of site-specific (smooth) effects.
Our adaption of CWB preserves all the important properties of the original

models in high-dimensional feature spaces, and yields equivalent model
estimates as CWB on pooled data. Next to a derivation of the equivalence of
both algorithms, we also showcase the efficacy of our algorithm on a

between progenitor systems is through radio observations; a non-degenerate
companion star is expected to lose material through winds or binary interaction
prior to explosion, and the SN ejecta crashing into this nearby circumstellar

developed by us allows the user to quickly deploy a swarm of drones, generating
flight paths simulating archery. The haptic interface LinkGlide delivers a
tactile stimulus of the bowstring tension to the forearm to increase the
precision of aiming. The swarm of released drones dynamically avoids collisions
between each other, the drone following the user, and external obstacles with
behavior control based on deep reinforcement learning.
  The developed concept was tested in the scenario with a human, where the user
shoots from a virtual bow with a real drone to hit the target. The human
operator observes the ballistic trajectory of the drone in an AR and achieves a
realistic and highly recognizable experience of the bowstring tension through
the haptic display.
  The experimental results revealed that the system improves trajectory
prediction accuracy by 63.3% through applying AR technology and conveying
haptic feedback of pulling force. DroneARchery users highlighted the
naturalness (4.3 out of 5 point Likert scale) and increased confidence (4.7 out
of 5) when controlling the drone. We have designed the tactile patterns to
present four sliding distances (tension) and three applied force levels
(stiffness) of the haptic display. Users demonstrated the ability to
distinguish tactile patterns produced by the haptic display representing
varying bowstring tension(average recognition rate is of 72.8%) and stiffness
(average recognition rate is of 94.2%).
  The novelty of the research is the development of an AR-based approach for

between fine-grained sub-classes) which is essential for separating
fine-grained categories. Considering most current methods cannot transfer

attosecond light sources and attosecond time-resolved studies of dynamics in

create isolated attosecond pulses and to extend the cut-off energy. Here, we
study the properties of HHG in liquids, including water and several alcohols,
by continuously tuning the pulse duration of a mid-infrared driver from the
multi- to the sub-two-cycle regime. Similar to the gas phase, we observe the
transition from discrete odd-order harmonics to continuous extreme-ultraviolet
emission. However, the cut-off energy is shown to be entirely independent of
the pulse duration. This observation is confirmed by ab-initio simulations of
HHG in large clusters. Our results support the notion that the cut-off energy
is a fundamental property of the liquid, independent of the driving-pulse
properties. Combined with the recently reported wavelength-independence of the
cutoff, these results confirm the direct sensitivity of HHG to the mean-free
paths of slow electrons in liquids. Our results additionally imply that
few-cycle mid-infrared laser pulses are suitable drivers for generating
isolated attosecond pulses from liquids.

models in the real world is lack of generalization: The accuracy of models,

settings of real business. There is relatively little methods exist that
estimate the confidence of prediction models. In this paper, we propose novel
methods that, given a neural network classification model, estimate uncertainty

method that, given a model and a confidence level, calculates a threshold that
separates prediction generated by this model into two subsets, one of them
meets the given confidence level. In contrast to other methods, the proposed
methods do not require any changes on existing neural networks, because they
simply build on the output logit layer of a common neural network. In
particular, the methods infer the confidence of a particular prediction based
on the distribution of the logit values corresponding to this prediction. The
proposed methods constitute a tool that is recommended for filtering
predictions in the process of knowledge extraction, e.g. based on web
scrapping, where predictions subsets are identified that maximize the precision
on cost of the recall, which is less important due to the availability of data.
The method has been tested on different tasks including relation extraction,

numerous successes in nuclear theory over the past decades and is currently the

the phenomenological character of the EDF method also comes with important
limitations, such as the lack of an explicit connection with quantum
chromodynamics (QCD). As was argued in the first paper of this series,
reformulating the EDF framework as an EFT would enable us to overcome these
limitations. In particular, path-integral (PI) techniques are suited to achieve
such a purpose as they allow to design numerous non-perturbative approximations

distributed neural network architectures that can perform efficient inference
within sensor networks with communication bandwidth constraints. The different
sensor channels are distributed across multiple sensor devices, which have to
exchange data over bandwidth-limited communication channels to solve, e.g., a
classification task. Our design methodology starts from a user-defined
centralized neural network and transforms it into a distributed architecture in
which the channels are distributed over different nodes. The distributed
network consists of two parallel branches of which the outputs are fused at the
fusion center. The first branch collects classification results from local,
node-specific classifiers while the second branch compresses each node's signal
and then reconstructs the multi-channel time series for classification at the
fusion center. We further improve bandwidth gains by dynamically activating the
compression path when the local classifications do not suffice. We validate
this method on a motor execution task in an emulated EEG sensor network and
analyze the resulting bandwidth-accuracy trade-offs. Our experiments show that
the proposed framework enables up to a factor 20 in bandwidth reduction with
minimal loss (up to 2%) in classification accuracy compared to the centralized
baseline on the demonstrated motor execution task. The proposed method offers a
way to smoothly transform a centralized architecture to a distributed,
bandwidth-efficient network amenable for low-power sensor networks. While the
application focus of this paper is on wearable brain-computer interfaces, the

  Stochastic Normalizing Flows",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Remote sensing images (RSIs) in real scenes may be disturbed by multiple
factors such as optical blur, undersampling, and additional noise, resulting in
complex and diverse degradation models. At present, the mainstream SR
algorithms only consider a single and fixed degradation (such as bicubic
interpolation) and cannot flexibly handle complex degradations in real scenes.
Therefore, designing a super-resolution (SR) model that can cope with various
degradations is gradually attracting the attention of researchers. Some studies
first estimate the degradation kernels and then perform degradation-adaptive SR
but face the problems of estimation error amplification and insufficient
high-frequency details in the results. Although blind SR algorithms based on
generative adversarial networks (GAN) have greatly improved visual quality,
they still suffer from pseudo-texture, mode collapse, and poor training
stability. In this article, we propose a novel blind SR framework based on the
stochastic normalizing flow (BlindSRSNF) to address the above problems.
BlindSRSNF learns the conditional probability distribution over the
high-resolution image space given a low-resolution (LR) image by explicitly
optimizing the variational bound on the likelihood. BlindSRSNF is easy to train
and can generate photo-realistic SR results that outperform GAN-based models.
Besides, we introduce a degradation representation strategy based on
contrastive learning to avoid the error amplification problem caused by the
explicit degradation estimation. Comprehensive experiments show that the
proposed algorithm can obtain SR results with excellent visual perception
quality on both simulated LR and real-world RSIs.

arbitrary $q$-ary codes, for all integer values of $q\geq 2$. A code is called
$(p,L)_q$-list-decodable if every radius $pn$ Hamming ball contains less than
$L$ codewords; $(p,\ell,L)_q$-list-recoverability is a generalization where we
place radius $pn$ Hamming balls on every point of a combinatorial rectangle
with side length $\ell$ and again stipulate that there be less than $L$
codewords.
  Our main contribution is to precisely calculate the maximum value of $p$ for
which there exist infinite families of positive rate
$(p,\ell,L)_q$-list-recoverable codes, the quantity we call the zero-rate
threshold. Denoting this value by $p_*$, we in fact show that codes correcting
a $p_*+\varepsilon$ fraction of errors must have size $O_{\varepsilon}(1)$,
i.e., independent of $n$. Such a result is typically referred to as a ``Plotkin
bound.'' To complement this, a standard random code with expurgation
construction shows that there exist positive rate codes correcting a
$p_*-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors. We also follow a classical proof template
(typically attributed to Elias and Bassalygo) to derive from the zero-rate
threshold other tradeoffs between rate and decoding radius for list-decoding
and list-recovery.
  Technically, proving the Plotkin bound boils down to demonstrating the Schur
convexity of a certain function defined on the $q$-simplex as well as the
convexity of a univariate function derived from it. We remark that an earlier
argument claimed similar results for $q$-ary list-decoding; however, we point
out that this earlier proof is flawed.

ranking and recommender systems, particularly on how to evaluate if a
recommender allocates exposure equally across groups of relevant items (also
known as provider fairness). While this research has laid an important
foundation, it gave rise to different approaches depending on whether relevant
items are compared per-user/per-query or aggregated across users. Despite both
being established and intuitive, we discover that these two notions can lead to
opposite conclusions, a form of Simpson's Paradox. We reconcile these notions
and show that the tension is due to differences in distributions of users where
items are relevant, and break down the important factors of the user's
recommendations. Based on this new understanding, practitioners might be
interested in either notions, but might face challenges with the per-user
metric due to partial observability of the relevance and user satisfaction,
typical in real-world recommenders. We describe a technique based on
distribution matching to estimate it in such a scenario. We demonstrate on

such an approach.

active tumors using positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography

utilized in clinical practice and clinical drug research to detect and measure
metabolically active malignancies. The assessment of tumor burden using manual

learning algorithms have also produced effective solutions in this area.
However, there may be a need to improve the performance of a pre-trained deep
learning network without the opportunity to modify this network. We investigate
the potential benefits of test-time augmentation for segmenting tumors from
PET-CT pairings. We applied a new framework of multilevel and multimodal tumor
segmentation techniques that can simultaneously consider PET and CT data. In
this study, we improve the network using a learnable composition of test time
augmentations. We trained U-Net and Swin U-Netr on the training database to
determine how different test time augmentation improved segmentation
performance. We also developed an algorithm that finds an optimal test time
augmentation contribution coefficient set. Using the newly trained U-Net and
Swin U-Netr results, we defined an optimal set of coefficients for test-time
augmentation and utilized them in combination with a pre-trained fixed nnU-Net.
The ultimate idea is to improve performance at the time of testing when the
model is fixed. Averaging the predictions with varying ratios on the augmented

semantics to model user preferences at the global level. We also propose a
model-agnostic history-enhanced confidence (MaHec) label to focus our model on

users' next activities (as an auxiliary task) and locations. For model
evaluation, we test the performances of our Hgarn against existing SOTAs in
recurring and explorative settings. The recurring setting focuses more on
assessing models' capabilities to capture users' individual-level preferences.
In contrast, the results in the explorative setting tend to reflect the power
of different models to learn users' global-level preferences. Overall, our

vibrational kinetics of CO2 and CO under various non-equilibrium plasma
conditions. A self-consistent model, previously validated for pure CO2
discharges, is further extended by adding the vibrational kinetics of CO,
including electron impact excitation and de-excitation (e-V),
vibration-to-translation relaxation (V-T) and vibration-to-vibration energy
exchange (V-V) processes. The vibrational kinetics considered include levels up
to v = 10 for CO and up to v1=2 and v2=v3=5, respectively for the symmetric
stretch, bending and asymmetric stretch modes of CO2, and accounts for e-V, V-T
in collisions between CO, CO2 and O2 molecules and O atoms and V-V processes
involving all possible transfers involving CO2 and CO molecules. The kinetic
scheme is validated by comparing the model predictions with recent experimental
data measured in a DC glow discharge, operating at pressures in the range 0.4 -
5 Torr (53.33 - 666.66 Pa). The experimental results show a lower vibrational
temperature of the different modes of CO2 and a decreased dissociation fraction
of CO2 when O2 is added to the plasma but an increase of the vibrational
temperature of CO. On the one hand, the simulations suggest that the former
effect is the result of the stronger V-T energy-transfer collisions with O
atoms which leads to an increase of the relaxation of the CO2 vibrational
modes; On the other hand, the back reactions with O2 contribute to the lower
CO2 dissociation fraction with increased O2 content in the mixture.

quantities that characterization the black holes. A new method to empirically
determine the spin mass-energy characteristics of astrophysical black holes is
presented and applied here. Results are obtained for a sample of 100
supermassive black holes with collimated dual outflows and redshifts between
about zero and two. An analysis indicates that about two-thirds of the black
holes are maximally spinning, while one-third have a broad distribution of spin
values; it is shown that the same distributions describe the quantity
$\rm{(M_{rot}/M_{irr})}$. The new method is applied to obtain the black hole
spin mass-energy, $\rm{M_{spin}}$, available for extraction relative to: the
maximum possible value, the irreducible black hole mass, and the total black
hole mass, $\rm{M_{dyn}}$. The total energy removed from the black hole system
and deposited into the circumgalactic medium via dual outflows over the entire
outflow lifetime of the source, $\rm{E_T}$, is studied relative to
$\rm{M_{dyn}}$ and relative to the spin energy available per black hole,
$\rm{E_{spin}/(M_{\odot}c^2)}$. The mean value of $\rm{Log(E_T/M_{dyn})}$ is
about $(-2.47\pm 0.27)$. Several explanations of this and related results are
discussed. For example, the energy input to the ambient gas from the outflow
could turn off the accretion, or the impact of the black hole mass loss on the
system could destabilize and terminate the outflow. The small values and
restricted range of values of $\rm{Log(E_T/M_{dyn})}$ and
$\rm{Log(E_T/E_{spin})}$ could suggest that these are fundamental properties of
the primary process responsible for producing the dual collimated outflows.

  Version 3 fixed problem with .bbl file",,"10.21105/astro.2210.07781",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recent studies have shown that velocity differences of very wide binary
stars, measured to high precision with GAIA, can provide an interesting test
for modified-gravity theories which emulate dark matter; in essence, MOND-like
theories (with external field effect included) predict that wide binaries
(wider than ~ 7 kAU) should orbit ~ 15% faster than Newtonian for similar
orbits; such a shift is readily detectable in principle in the sample of 9,000
candidate systems selected from GAIA EDR3 by Pittordis and Sutherland (2022;
PS22). However, the main obstacle at present is the observed ""fat tail"" of
candidate wide-binary systems with velocity differences at ~1.5 - 6x circular
velocity; this tail cannot be bound pure binary systems, but a possible
explanation of the tail is triple or quadruple systems with unresolved or
undetected additional star(s). While this tail can be modelled and
statistically subtracted, obtaining an accurate model for the triple population
is crucial for a robust test for modified gravity. In this paper we explore
prospects for observationally constraining the triple population: we simulate a
population of hierarchical triple systems ""observed"" as in PS22 at random
epochs and viewing angles; for each simulated system we evaluate various
possible methods for detecting the third star, including GAIA astrometry,
radial velocity drift, and several imaging methods from direct Rubin images,
speckle imaging and coronagraphic imaging. Results are generally encouraging,
in that typically 90% of the triple systems in the key regions of parameter
space are detectable; there is a moderate ""dead zone"" of cool brown-dwarf
companions at ~ 25-100 AU separation which are not detectable with any of our
baseline methods. A large but feasible observing campaign can greatly clarify
the effect of the triple/quadruple population and make the gravity test
decisive.

fluid model. Sixty different positive streamers are simulated by varying the
electrode length, the pulse duration and the applied voltage. Between these
cases, the streamer radius and velocity vary by about an order of magnitude,
but the variation in the maximal electric field is significantly smaller, about
30%. We find that G-values for the production of N(4S), O(3P), NO and N2O,
which have relatively high activation energies, vary by about 30% to 55%. This
variation is mainly caused by two factors: differences in the fraction of
energy deposited in the streamer head region, and differences in the maximal
electric field at the streamer head. When accounting for both factors, our
computed G-values are in good agreement with an analytic estimate proposed by
Naidis (2012 Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 21 042001). We also simulate negative
streamers and find that their production of N(4S), O(3P) and NO is less energy
efficient. The results suggest that energy efficiency can be increased by
reducing Joule heating in the streamer channel and by increasing the maximal
electric field at the streamer head, for example by using short voltage pulses
with a high applied voltage.

incentives of users and miners to operate correctly and offer a high quality of

present a general framework that captures both myopic and non-myopic settings,

framework, when restricted to the myopic case, we show that while the mechanism
that requires a user to ""pay-as-bid"", and greedily chooses among available
transactions based on their fees, is not dominant strategy incentive-compatible
for users, it has a Bayesian-Nash equilibrium where bids are slightly shaded.
Relaxing this incentive compatibility requirement circumvents the impossibility
results proven by previous works, and allows for an approximately revenue and
welfare optimal, myopic miner incentive-compatible (MMIC), and
off-chain-agreement (OCA)-proof mechanism. We prove these guarantees using
different benchmarks, and show that the pay-as-bid greedy auction is the
revenue optimal Bayesian incentive-compatible, MMIC and 1-OCA-proof mechanism
among a large class of mechanisms. We move beyond the myopic setting explored
in the literature, to one where users offer transaction fees for their
transaction to be accepted, as well as report their urgency level by specifying
the time to live of the transaction, after which it expires. We analyze
pay-as-bid mechanisms in this setting, and show the competitive ratio
guarantees provided by the greedy allocation rule. We then present a
better-performing non-myopic rule, and analyze its competitive ratio. The above
analysis is stated in terms of a cryptocurrency TFM, but applies to other

we found no evidence of major shifts in the topical content of discussion over

recovery algorithms, without explicit knowledge of the sparsity. Estimating the
sparsity order is a crucial problem in many practical scenarios, e.g., wireless
communications, where exact value of the sparsity order of the unknown channel
may be unavailable a priori. In this paper we have proposed a new greedy
algorithm, referred to as the Multiple Choice Hard Thresholding Pursuit
(MCHTP), which modifies the popular hard thresholding pursuit (HTP) suitably to
iteratively recover the unknown sparse vector along with the sparsity order of
the unknown vector. We provide provable performance guarantees which ensures
that MCHTP can estimate the sparsity order exactly, along with recovering the
unknown sparse vector exactly with noiseless measurements. The simulation
results corroborate the theoretical findings, demonstrating that even without
exact sparsity knowledge, with only the knowledge of a loose upper bound of the
sparsity, MCHTP exhibits outstanding recovery performance, which is almost
identical to that of the conventional HTP with exact sparsity knowledge.
Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate much lower computational complexity
of MCHTP compared to other state-of-the-art techniques like MSP.

widely used for the point cloud due to its unique advantages in terms of visual
results. However, existing convolutional neural network accelerators suffer
from non-trivial performance degradation when employed to accelerate SSCN
because of the extreme and unstructured sparsity, and the complex computational
dependency between the sparsity of the central activation and the neighborhood
ones. In this paper, we propose a high performance FPGA-based accelerator for
SSCN. Firstly, we develop a zero removing strategy to remove the coarse-grained
redundant regions, thus significantly improving computational efficiency.
Secondly, we propose a concise encoding scheme to obtain the matching
information for efficient point-wise multiplications. Thirdly, we develop a
sparse data matching unit and a computing core based on the proposed encoding
scheme, which can convert the irregular sparse operations into regular
multiply-accumulate operations. Finally, an efficient hardware architecture for
the submanifold sparse convolutional layer is developed and implemented on the
Xilinx ZCU102 field-programmable gate array board, where the 3D submanifold
sparse U-Net is taken as the benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate
that our design drastically improves computational efficiency, and can
dramatically improve the power efficiency by 51 times compared to GPU.

Unfortunately, the popular data-poisoning DNN watermarking scheme relies on
target model fine-tuning to embed watermarks, which limits its practical
applications in tackling real-world tasks. Specifically, the learning of
watermarks via tedious model fine-tuning on a poisoned dataset
(carefully-crafted sample-label pairs) is not efficient in tackling the tasks
on challenging datasets and production-level DNN model protection. To address

dataset. The detector clearly exhibits this bias when employed on a target
dataset, particularly towards object sizes. However, object sizes vary heavily
between domains due to, for instance, different labeling policies or
geographical locations. State-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation
approaches outsource methods to overcome the object size bias. Mainstream size
adaptation approaches exploit target domain statistics, contradicting the
original unsupervised assumption. Our novel unsupervised anchor calibration
method addresses this limitation. Given a model trained on the source data, we
estimate the optimal target anchors in a completely unsupervised manner. The
main idea stems from an intuitive observation: by varying the anchor sizes for
the target domain, we inevitably introduce noise or even remove valuable object
cues. The latent object representation, perturbed by the anchor size, is
closest to the learned source features only under the optimal target anchors.
We leverage this observation for anchor size optimization. Our experimental
results show that, without any retraining, we achieve competitive results even
compared to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised size adaptation approaches. In
addition, our anchor calibration can be combined with such existing methods,
making them completely unsupervised.

The presented method consists of two stages of training and testing. In the
training phase, the co-occurrence matrix operator is first applied on healthy
images and then the amount of output energy is calculated. In the following,
according to the changes in the amount of energy, a suitable feature vector is
defined, and with the help of it, a suitable threshold for the health of the
images is obtained. Then, in the test phase, with the help of the calculated
quorum, the defective parts are distinguished from the healthy ones. In the
results section, the mentioned method has been applied on stone and ceramic

previous methods. Among the advantages of the presented method, we can mention
high accuracy, low calculations and compatibility with all types of levels due

available. This work discovers previously unknown problems of student-teacher
approaches for AD and proposes a solution, where two neural networks are
trained to produce the same output for the defect-free training examples. The
core assumption of student-teacher networks is that the distance between the
outputs of both networks is larger for anomalies since they are absent in
training. However, previous methods suffer from the similarity of student and
teacher architecture, such that the distance is undesirably small for
anomalies. For this reason, we propose asymmetric student-teacher networks
(AST). We train a normalizing flow for density estimation as a teacher and a
conventional feed-forward network as a student to trigger large distances for
anomalies: The bijectivity of the normalizing flow enforces a divergence of
teacher outputs for anomalies compared to normal data. Outside the training
distribution the student cannot imitate this divergence due to its
fundamentally different architecture. Our AST network compensates for wrongly
estimated likelihoods by a normalizing flow, which was alternatively used for
anomaly detection in previous work. We show that our method produces
state-of-the-art results on the two currently most relevant defect detection
datasets MVTec AD and MVTec 3D-AD regarding image-level anomaly detection on
RGB and 3D data.

  Collider Physics (LHCP2022)",,,,"nucl-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Based on the coalescence model, we analyse the light-nuclei production near
the critical point by expanding the phase-space distribution function
$f(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{p})$ in terms of the phase-space cumulants $\sim \langle
r^m p^m\rangle_c$. We show that the dominant contribution of the phase-space
distribution to the yield of light nuclei is determined by the second-order
phase-space cumulants. Here, we identify the fireball size, the homogeneity
length, and the effective temperature, which are encoded in the second-order
phase-space cumulants, as the relevant scales in explaining the yield of light
nuclei. These scales are typically much larger than the correlation length of
the critical fluctuations created in the rapid expansion of the heavy-ion
systems, so we need to eliminate this dominant contribution of the relevant
scales in order to isolate the critical contribution from the yield of light
nuclei. We find that the second-order phase-space cumulants appeared in the
yields of light-nuclei with different mass numbers share a similar structure.
This property allows us to construct ratios of light-nuclei yields in
appropriate combinations so that the effect of the relevant scales of the
light-nuclei yield cancels, which isolates the critical effects.

of the coupled data, computation, and networking resources among heterogeneous
geo-distributed edge nodes. Recently, there has been a trend to orchestrate and
schedule containerized application workloads in CEC, while Kubernetes has
become the de-facto standard broadly adopted by the industry and academia.
However, Kubernetes is not preferable for CEC because its design is not
dedicated to edge computing and neglects the unique features of edge
nativeness. More specifically, Kubernetes primarily ensures resource provision
of workloads while neglecting the performance requirements of edge-native
applications, such as throughput and latency. Furthermore, Kubernetes neglects
the inner dependencies of edge-native applications and fails to consider data
locality and networking resources, leading to inferior performance. In this
work, we design and develop ENTS, the first edge-native task scheduling system,
to manage the distributed edge resources and facilitate efficient task
scheduling to optimize the performance of edge-native applications. ENTS
extends Kubernetes with the unique ability to collaboratively schedule
computation and networking resources by comprehensively considering job profile
and resource status. We showcase the superior efficacy of ENTS with a case
study on data streaming applications. We mathematically formulate a joint task
allocation and flow scheduling problem that maximizes the job throughput. We
design two novel online scheduling algorithms to optimally decide the task
allocation, bandwidth allocation, and flow routing policies. The extensive
experiments on a real-world edge video analytics application show that ENTS
achieves 43\%-220\% higher average job throughput compared with the

algorithms, Siamese Network coupled with k Nearest Neighbors (SN-kNN) and
Prototypical Network (PN), were tested. Rather than utilizing solely visible
images as discussed in previous studies, we also used Infrared (IR) images. We
analyzed the training process, test performance and inference speed of two
algorithms on both image formats, and also used t-SNE to visualize learned
features. The results demonstrated that both SN-kNN and PN were capable to
distinguish flame states from learning with merely 20 images per flame state.
The worst performance, which was realized by PN on IR images, still possessed
precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score above 0.95. We showed that visible
images demonstrated more substantial differences between classes and presented
more consistent patterns inside the class, which made the training speed and
model performance better compared to IR images. In contrast, the relatively low
quality of IR images made it difficult for PN to extract distinguishable
prototypes, which caused relatively weak performance. With the entrire training
set supporting classification, SN-kNN performed well with IR images. On the
other hand, benefitting from the architecture design, PN has a much faster
speed in training and inference than SN-kNN. The presented work analyzed the
characteristics of both algorithms and image formats for the first time, thus
providing guidance for their future utilization in combustion monitoring tasks.

data from Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) survey. The
effective area used in our analyses after field selection, mask and boundary
exclusions is $\sim 58 \deg^2$. The source galaxies are divided into low- and
high-redshift bins with $0.2\le z_p\le0.85$ and $0.85\le z_p\le1.5$,
respectively. We utilize our halo-based theoretical peak model including the
projection effect of large-scale structures to derive cosmological constraints
from the observed tomographic high peak abundances with the signal-to-noise
ratio in the range of $\nu_{\rm N}=[3.5,5.5]$. These high peaks are closely
associated with the lensing effects of massive clusters of galaxies. Thus the
inclusion of their member galaxies in the shear catalog can lead to significant
source clustering and dilute their lensing signals. We account for this
systematic effect in our theoretical modelling. Additionally, the impacts of
baryonic effects, galaxy intrinsic alignments, as well as residual
uncertainties in shear and photometric redshift calibrations are also analyzed.
Within the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, the derived constraint is
$S_8=0.758_{-0.076}^{+0.033}$ and $0.768_{-0.057}^{+0.030}$ with the source
clustering information measured from the two cluster catalogs, CAMIRA and WZL,
respectively. The asymmetric uncertainties are due to the different degeneracy
direction of $(\Omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8)$ from high peak abundances comparing
to that from the cosmic shear two-point correlations which give rise
approximately the power index $\alpha=0.5$. Fitting to our constraints, we
obtain $\alpha\approx 0.38$ and $\Sigma_8=0.772_{-0.032}^{+0.028}$ (CAMIRA) and
$0.781_{-0.033}^{+0.028}$ (WZL). In comparison with the results from

range of timescales, with the presence of a most prominent cycle with a mean
length of 11 years. Such variability is transported within the heliosphere by
solar wind, radiation and other processes, affecting the properties of the
interplanetary medium. The presence of solar activity-related periodicities is
well visible in different solar wind and geomagnetic indices, although with
time lags with respect to the solar one, leading to hysteresis cycles. Here, we
investigate the time lag behaviour between a physical proxy of the solar
activity, the Ca II K index, and two solar wind parameters (speed and dynamic
pressure), studying how their pairwise relative lags vary over almost five
solar cycles. We find that the lag between Ca II K index and solar wind speed
is not constant over the whole time interval investigated, with values ranging
from 6 years to 1 year (average 3.2 years). A similar behaviour is found also
for the solar wind dynamic pressure. Then, by using a Lomb-Scargle periodogram
analysis we obtain a 10.21-year mean periodicity for the speed and 10.30-year
for the dynamic pressure. We speculate that the different periodicities of the
solar wind parameters with respect to the solar 11-year cycle may be related to
the overall observed temporal evolution of the time lags. Finally, by
accounting for them, we obtain empirical relations that link the amplitude of
the Ca II K index to the two solar wind parameters.

generated by the diffraction of a plane wave passing through a binary mask with
holes of the same size, placed at specific positions of a rectangular grid.
Fresnel binary atom holography was recently proposed as a means for achieving
nanometer-resolution mask-based lithography with metastable atom beams. In
practice, there will be fabrication imposed limits: the binary mask will have a
minimum hole size, a minimum distance between the holes in the grid~(pitch), a
maximum size, and the target pattern plane will always have a finite distance
from the mask. In this paper, we show that, in praxis, for a given wavelength,
mask, and target pattern sizes, there will be a cross-over value for the
distance between the mask and the target pattern plane (the screen plane) which
results in aliasing-free patterns. It is demonstrated how this insight can lead
to the generation of better-resolved patterns of higher contrast and nanometer
resolution can be achieved within experimental limitations. Since flux is one
of the main factors influencing the quality of patterns fabricated by
nano-lithography, we obtain an expression for the ``patterning flux'' (the flux
that contributes to producing the target pattern, normalized by the flux that
is incident onto the structured portion of the mask). Numerically we find that
its ratio scales approximately like $x^{-2}$ where $x$ is the mask-screen
distance over the cross-over distance. The method that we propose can be used
with any beam that can be modeled as a scalar wave, including acoustic waves
and other matter-wave beams such as helium ions or electrons.

ladder and pick a random spanning tree with a certain edge weight $c$ for the
(vertical) rungs. Now take a random walk on that spanning tree with a bias
$\beta>1$ to the right. In contrast to other random graphs considered in the
literature (random percolation clusters, Galton-Watson trees) this one allows
for an explicit analysis based on a decomposition of the graph into independent
pieces.
  We give an explicit formula for the speed of the biased random walk as a
function of both the bias $\beta$ and the edge weight $c$. We conclude that the
speed is a continuous, unimodal function of $\beta$ that is positive if and
only if $\beta < \beta_c^{(1)}$ for an explicit critical value $\beta_c^{(1)}$
depending on $c$. In particular, the phase transition at $\beta_c^{(1)}$ is of
second order.
  We show that another second order phase transition takes place at another
critical value $\beta_c^{(2)}<\beta_c^{(1)}$ that is also explicitly known: For
$\beta<\beta_c^{(2)}$ the times the walker spends in traps have second moments
and (after subtracting the linear speed) the position fulfills a central limit
theorem. We see that $\beta_c^{(2)}$ is smaller than the value of $\beta$ which
achieves the maximal value of the speed. Finally, concerning linear response,
we confirm the Einstein relation for the unbiased model ($\beta=1$) by proving
a central limit theorem and computing the variance.

recognizes direct discrimination and overlooks indirect and proxy
discrimination, providing an incomplete picture. In this work, we measure a
broadened discrimination notion called disparate impact (DI), which encompasses
any disparity in the loan's funding rate that does not commensurate with the
actual return rate. We develop a two-stage predictor substitution approach to
estimate DI from observational data. Our findings reveal (i) female borrowers,
given identical actual return rates, are 3.97% more likely to receive funding,
(ii) at least 37.1% of this DI favoring female is indirect or proxy
discrimination, and (iii) DT indeed underestimates the overall female
favoritism by 44.6%. However, we also identify the overall female favoritism
can be explained by one specific discrimination driver, rational statistical
discrimination, wherein investors accurately predict the expected return rate
from imperfect observations. Furthermore, female borrowers still require 2%
higher expected return rate to secure funding, indicating another driver
taste-based discrimination co-exists and is against female. These results
altogether tell a cautionary tale: on one hand, P2P lending provides a valuable
alternative credit market where the affirmative action to support female
naturally emerges from the rational crowd; on the other hand, while the overall
discrimination effect (both in terms of DI or DT) favors female, concerning
taste-based discrimination can persist and can be obscured by other co-existing
discrimination drivers, such as statistical discrimination.

algorithms making arbitrary choices and isomorphism-invariant logics. One
approach to overcome this problem is witnessed symmetric choice. It allows for
choices from definable orbits which are certified by definable witnessing
automorphisms.
  We consider the extension of fixed-point logic with counting (IFPC) with
witnessed symmetric choice (IFPC+WSC) and a further extension with an
interpretation operator (IFPC+WSC+I). The latter operator evaluates a
subformula in the structure defined by an interpretation. This structure
possibly has other automorphisms exploitable by the WSC-operator. For similar
extensions of pure fixed-point logic (IFP) it is known that IFP+WSCI simulates
counting which IFP+WSC fails to do. For IFPC+WSC it is unknown whether the
interpretation operator increases expressiveness and thus allows studying the
relation between WSC and interpretations beyond counting.
  In this paper, we separate IFPC+WSC from IFPC+WSCI by showing that IFPC+WSC
is not closed under FO-interpretations. By the same argument, we answer an open
question of Dawar and Richerby regarding non-witnessed symmetric choice in IFP.
Additionally, we prove that nesting WSC-operators increases the expressiveness
using the so-called CFI graphs. We show that if IFPC+WSC+I canonizes a
particular class of base graphs, then it also canonizes the corresponding CFI
graphs. This differs from various other logics, where CFI graphs provide
difficult instances.

the uniform measure $\nu_\mathcal{S}$ whose support is given by $\mathcal{S}$.
The measure $\nu_\mathcal{S}$ can be regarded as a
$\delta(\nu_\mathcal{S},t)$-approximate $t$-design, $t\in\mathbb{Z}_+$. We
propose a random matrix model that aims to describe the probability
distribution of $\delta(\nu_\mathcal{S},t)$ for any $t$. Our model is given by
a block diagonal matrix whose blocks are independent, given by Gaussian or
Ginibre ensembles, and their number, size and type is determined by $t$. We
prove that, the operator norm of this matrix, $\delta({t})$, is the random
variable to which $\sqrt{|\mathcal{S}|}\delta(\nu_\mathcal{S},t)$ converges in
distribution when the number of elements in $\mathcal{S}$ grows to infinity.
Moreover, we characterize our model giving explicit bounds on the tail
probabilities $\mathbb{P}(\delta(t)>2+\epsilon)$, for any $\epsilon>0$. We also
show that our model satisfies the so-called spectral gap conjecture, i.e. we
prove that with the probability $1$ there is $t\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ such that
$\sup_{k\in\mathbb{Z}_{+}}\delta(k)=\delta(t)$. Numerical simulations give
convincing evidence that the proposed model is actually almost exact for any
cardinality of $\mathcal{S}$. The heuristic explanation of this phenomenon,
that we provide, leads us to conjecture that the tail probabilities
$\mathbb{P}(\sqrt{\mathcal{S}}\delta(\nu_\mathcal{S},t)>2+\epsilon)$ are
bounded from above by the tail probabilities $\mathbb{P}(\delta(t)>2+\epsilon)$
of our random matrix model. In particular our conjecture implies that a Haar
random set $\mathcal{S}\subset U(d)$ satisfies the spectral gap conjecture with
the probability $1$.

which agents achieve network-wide solutions by peer-to-peer communication
without the central server. Since communication tends to be slower than
computation, when each agent communicates with only a few neighboring agents
per iteration, they can complete iterations faster than with more agents or a
central server. However, the total number of iterations to reach a network-wide
solution is affected by the speed at which the agents' information is ``mixed''
by communication. We found that popular communication topologies either have
large maximum degrees (such as stars and complete graphs) or are ineffective at
mixing information (such as rings and grids). To address this problem, we
propose a new family of topologies, EquiTopo, which has an (almost) constant
degree and a network-size-independent consensus rate that is used to measure
the mixing efficiency.
  In the proposed family, EquiStatic has a degree of $\Theta(\ln(n))$, where
$n$ is the network size, and a series of time-dependent one-peer topologies,
EquiDyn, has a constant degree of 1. We generate EquiDyn through a certain
random sampling procedure. Both of them achieve an $n$-independent consensus
rate. We apply them to decentralized SGD and decentralized gradient tracking

insight by isolating the essential degrees of freedom that dictate the
thermodynamic properties of a complex, condensed-phase system. The reduced
complexity of the model typically leads to lower computational costs and more
efficient sampling compared to atomistic models. Designing ``good''
coarse-grained models is an art. Generally, the mapping from fine-grained
configurations to coarse-grained configurations itself is not optimized in any
way; instead, the energy function associated with the mapped configurations is.
In this work, we explore the consequences of optimizing the coarse-grained
representation alongside its potential energy function. We use a graph machine
learning framework to embed atomic configurations into a low dimensional space
to produce efficient representations of the original molecular system. Because
the representation we obtain is no longer directly interpretable as a real
space representation of the atomic coordinates, we also introduce an inversion
process and an associated thermodynamic consistency relation that allows us to
rigorously sample fine-grained configurations conditioned on the coarse-grained
sampling. We show that this technique is robust, recovering the first two
moments of the distribution of several observables in proteins such as
chignolin and alanine dipeptide.

spaces for text-driven attribute manipulations. Currently, the latent mapping
between these two spaces is empirically designed and confines that each
manipulation model can only handle one fixed text prompt. In this paper, we
propose a method named Free-Form CLIP (FFCLIP), aiming to establish an
automatic latent mapping so that one manipulation model handles free-form text
prompts. Our FFCLIP has a cross-modality semantic modulation module containing
semantic alignment and injection. The semantic alignment performs the automatic
latent mapping via linear transformations with a cross attention mechanism.
After alignment, we inject semantics from text prompt embeddings to the
StyleGAN latent space. For one type of image (e.g., `human portrait'), one
FFCLIP model can be learned to handle free-form text prompts. Meanwhile, we
observe that although each training text prompt only contains a single semantic
meaning, FFCLIP can leverage text prompts with multiple semantic meanings for
image manipulation. In the experiments, we evaluate FFCLIP on three types of
images (i.e., `human portraits', `cars', and `churches'). Both visual and

problem is ill-posed. We thus propose and analyze an asymptotic hypothesis test
for independent copies of a given random variable~$X$ which is supposed to
belong to an unknown domain of attraction of a stable law. The null hypothesis
$\mathbf{H_0}$ is: `$X$ is in the domain of attraction of the Normal law' and
the alternative hypothesis is $\mathbf{H_1}$: `$X$ is in the domain of
attraction of a stable law with index smaller than 2'. Our key observation is
that~$X$ cannot have a finite second moment when $\mathbf{H_0}$ is rejected

an effort to repair erroneously received coded packets, and then reattempts
network decoding. Most decoding techniques, including SD, assume that errors

Motivated by the guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) framework, we
propose transversal GRAND (T-GRAND): an algorithm that exploits statistical
dependence in the occurrence of errors, complements network decoding and
recovers all data packets with a higher probability than SD. T-GRAND examines

and planning, we propose a hierarchical motion generation method. Moreover, we
adopt probabilistic inference methods to formalize the hierarchical model and
stochastic optimization. We realize this approach as a weighted product of
stochastic, reactive expert policies, where planning is used to adaptively
compute the optimal weights over the task horizon. This stochastic optimization
avoids local optima and proposes feasible reactive plans that find paths in
cluttered and dense environments. Our extensive experimental study in planar
navigation and 6DoF manipulation shows that our proposed hierarchical motion
generation method outperforms both myopic reactive controllers and online
re-planning methods.

geophysical or geological data; however, many realisations of process models
that embody different conceptual models may provide similar consistency with
observed data, and finding all such realisations may be infeasible due to the
computational demands of the task. Alternatively, geophysical probabilistic
tomographic methods may be used to estimate the family of models of a target
subsurface structure that are consistent both with information obtained from
previous experiments and with new data (the Bayesian posterior distribution).
However, this family seldom embodies geologically reasonable images. We show
that the posterior distribution of tomographic images can be enhanced by
injecting geological prior information into Bayesian inference, and we can do
this near-instantaneously by trained MDNs. We invoke two geological concepts as
geological prior information: a braided river system, and a set of marine
parasequences, each parameterised by a GAN. Data from a target structure can
then be used to infer the image parameter values using either geological
concept using MDNs. Our MDN solutions closely resemble those found using
expensive McMC methods, and while the use of incorrect geological conceptual
models provides less accurate results the mean structures still approximate the
target. We then show that a classification network can infer the correct
geological conceptual model. Thus, imposing even incorrect geological prior
information may improve geophysical tomographic images compared to those
obtained without geological prior information, and in principle geological
conceptual models can be inferred directly from geophysical travel time data.

mapping results into embedding matrices that occupy a lot of memory (i.e.
millions of parameters) and grow linearly with the size of the vocabulary.
Previous work on on-device transformers dynamically generate token embeddings
on-the-fly without embedding matrices using locality-sensitive hashing over
morphological information. These embeddings are subsequently fed into
transformer layers for text classification. However, these methods are not
pre-trained. Inspired by this line of work, we propose HashFormers, a new

require an embedding matrix at all, further reducing the memory requirements.
We empirically demonstrate that HashFormers are more memory efficient compared
to standard pre-trained transformers while achieving comparable predictive
performance when fine-tuned on multiple text classification tasks. For example,

description of the minimal twist of eleven-dimensional supergravity. We find
that the spaces of local operators are modules for the exceptional linearly

roommate problem is the roommate diversity problem: each agent belongs to one
of two types (e.g., red and blue), and the agents' preferences over the
coalitions solely depend on the fraction of agents of their own type among
their roommates.
  There are various notions of stability that defines an optimal partitioning
of agents. The notion of popularity has received a lot of attention recently. A
partitioning of agents is popular if there does not exist another partitioning
in which more agents are better off than worse off. Computing a popular
partition in a stable roommate game can be done in polynomial time. When we
allow ties the stable roommate problem becomes NP-complete. Determining the
existence of a popular solution in the multidimensional stable roommate problem
also NP-hard.
  We show that in the roommate diversity problem with the room size fixed to
two, the problem becomes tractable. Particularly, a popular partitioning of
agents is guaranteed to exist and can be computed in polynomial time.
Additionally a mixed popular partitioning of agents is always guaranteed to
exist in any roommate diversity game. By contrast, when there are no
restrictions on the coalition size of a roommate diversity game, a popular
partitioning may fail to exist and the problem becomes intractable. Our results
intractability results are summarized as follows:
  * Determining the existence of a popular partitioning is co-NP-hard, even if
the agents' preferences are trichotomous.
  * Determining the existence of a strictly popular partitioning is co-NP-hard,
even if the agents' preferences are dichotomous.
  * Computing a mixed popular partitioning of agents in polynomial time is
impossible unless P=NP, even if the agents' preferences are dichotomous.

objectives and constraints that can change over time. Accordingly, trained
models can be tuned with sets of hyper-parameters that affect their predictive
behavior (e.g., their run-time efficiency versus error rate). As the number of
constraints and hyper-parameter dimensions grow, naively selected settings may
lead to sub-optimal and/or unreliable results. We develop an efficient method
for calibrating models such that their predictions provably satisfy multiple
explicit and simultaneous statistical guarantees (e.g., upper-bounded error
rates), while also optimizing any number of additional, unconstrained
objectives (e.g., total run-time cost). Building on recent results in
distribution-free, finite-sample risk control for general losses, we propose
Pareto Testing: a two-stage process which combines multi-objective optimization
with multiple hypothesis testing. The optimization stage constructs a set of
promising combinations on the Pareto frontier. We then apply statistical
testing to this frontier only to identify configurations that have (i) high
utility with respect to our objectives, and (ii) guaranteed risk levels with
respect to our constraints, with specifiable high probability. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach to reliably accelerate the execution of
large-scale Transformer models in natural language processing (NLP)

dynamically configure multiple inter-dependent model attributes -- including
the number of layers computed before exiting, number of attention heads pruned,

various accuracy and cost metrics.

  Intersections Using Sequence-to-Sequence Recurrent Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.AI cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Surrogate safety measures in the form of conflict indicators are
indispensable components of the proactive traffic safety toolbox. Conflict
indicators can be classified into past-trajectory-based conflicts and
predicted-trajectory-based conflicts. While the calculation of the former class
of conflicts is deterministic and unambiguous, the latter category is computed
using predicted vehicle trajectories and is thus more stochastic. Consequently,
the accuracy of prediction-based conflicts is contingent on the accuracy of the
utilized trajectory prediction algorithm. Trajectory prediction can be a
challenging task, particularly at intersections where vehicle maneuvers are
diverse. Furthermore, due to limitations relating to the road user trajectory
extraction pipelines, accurate geometric representation of vehicles during
conflict analysis is a challenging task. Misrepresented geometries distort the
real distances between vehicles under observation. In this research, a
prediction-based conflict identification methodology was proposed. A
sequence-to-sequence Recurrent Neural Network was developed to sequentially
predict future vehicle trajectories for up to 3 seconds ahead. Furthermore, the
proposed network was trained using the CitySim Dataset to forecast both future
vehicle positions and headings to facilitate the prediction of future bounding
boxes, thus maintaining accurate vehicle geometric representations. It was
experimentally determined that the proposed method outperformed frequently used
trajectory prediction models for conflict analysis at intersections. A
comparison between Time-to-Collision (TTC) conflict identification using
vehicle bounding boxes versus the commonly used vehicle center points for
geometric representation was conducted. Compared to the bounding box method,
the center point approach often failed to identify TTC conflicts or
underestimated their severity.

to the high data dimensionality, inconsistent sensor recordings, and lack of

typically relies on expert knowledge and thresholds. However, data is viewed
isolated and complex, multivariate relationships are neglected. In this work,
we present an autoencoder based end-to-end workflow for anomaly detection
suitable for multivariate time series data in large industrial cooling systems,
including explained fault localization and root cause analysis based on expert
knowledge. We identify system failures using a threshold on the total
reconstruction error (autoencoder reconstruction error including all sensor
signals). For fault localization, we compute the individual reconstruction
error (autoencoder reconstruction error for each sensor signal) allowing us to
identify the signals that contribute most to the total reconstruction error.
Expert knowledge is provided via look-up table enabling root-cause analysis and
assignment to the affected subsystem. We demonstrated our findings in a cooling
system unit including 34 sensors over a 8-months time period using 4-fold cross
validation approaches and automatically created labels based on thresholds
provided by domain experts. Using 4-fold cross validation, we reached a
F1-score of 0.56, whereas the autoencoder results showed a higher consistency
score (CS of 0.92) compared to the automatically created labels (CS of 0.62) --
indicating that the anomaly is recognized in a very stable manner. The main
anomaly was found by the autoencoder and automatically created labels and was
also recorded in the log files. Further, the explained fault localization
highlighted the most affected component for the main anomaly in a very
consistent manner.

written bespoke code for the simulations and present the results in a
methodical way showing many of the steps in the process. In the Appendices, I
discuss the technical challenges of constructing, testing and calibrating the
code, so that other non-experts in the field can reproduce the code and results
and build on the work that I have done. Although the work done here must be
considered preliminary, results suggest that the impact of the field
propagation time on the behaviour of the test mass in the restricted 3 body
problem outweighs the impact of the Post Newtonian corrections, in particular
due to a transfer of angular momentum from the binary system to the test mass,
and this effect may therefore be of interests to those studying accretion discs
of binary systems.

analyze the response of the uniform motion of the electromagnetic charged

intimately related to the zitterbewegung frequency appearing in Dirac's

improving the performance of intelligent transportation systems, especially
during the epidemic. How to dynamically model the complex spatiotemporal
dependencies of passenger flow is the main issue in achieving accurate
passenger flow prediction during the epidemic. To solve this issue, this paper
proposes a brand-new transformer-based architecture called STformer under the
encoder-decoder framework specifically for COVID-19. Concretely, we develop a
modified self-attention mechanism named Causal-Convolution ProbSparse
Self-Attention (CPSA) to model the multiple temporal dependencies of passenger
flow with low computational costs. To capture the complex and dynamic spatial
dependencies, we introduce a novel Adaptive Multi-Graph Convolution Network
(AMGCN) by leveraging multiple graphs in a self-adaptive manner. Additionally,
the Multi-source Data Fusion block fuses the passenger flow data, COVID-19
confirmed case data, and the relevant social media data to study the impact of
COVID-19 to passenger flow. Experiments on real-world passenger flow datasets
demonstrate the superiority of ST-former over the other eleven state-of-the-art
methods. Several ablation studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness
and reliability of our model structure. Results can provide critical insights

Starting from a random

analogy, starting from a certain Markov chain, we derive a master equation for
power laws that describes how the number of cascades changes over time
(cascades are consecutive transitions that end when the initial state is
reached). The partial differential equation has a closed form solution which
gives an explicit dependence of the number of cascades on their size and on
time. Furthermore, the power law solution has a natural cut-off, a feature
often seen in empirical data. This is due to the finite size a cascade can have
in a finite time horizon. The derivation of the equation provides a
justification for an exponent equal to 2, which agrees well with several
empirical distributions, including Richardson's law on the size and frequency
of deadly conflicts. Nevertheless, the equation can be solved for any exponent
value. In addition, we propose an urn model where the number of consecutive
ball extractions follows a power law. In all cases, the power law is manifest
over the entire range of cascade sizes, as shown through log-log plots in the

ingredients in scene understanding for automated driving tasks. A major problem
for LiDAR-based depth completion is the inefficient utilization of convolutions
due to the lack of coherent information as provided by the sparse nature of
uncorrelated LiDAR point clouds, which often leads to complex and
resource-demanding networks. The problem is reinforced by the expensive
aquisition of depth data for supervised training. In this work, we propose an
efficient depth completion model based on a vgg05-like CNN architecture and
propose a semi-supervised domain adaptation approach to transfer knowledge from
synthetic to real world data to improve data-efficiency and reduce the need for
a large database. In order to boost spatial coherence, we guide the learning
process using segmentations as additional source of information. The efficiency
and accuracy of our approach is evaluated on the KITTI dataset. Our approach
improves on previous efficient and low parameter state of the art approaches
while having a noticeably lower computational footprint.

than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision. This empirical
breakthrough is even more remarkable since, in contrast to CNNs, ViTs do not
embed any visual inductive bias of spatial locality. Yet, recent works have
shown that while minimizing their training loss, ViTs specifically learn
spatially localized patterns. This raises a central question: how do ViTs learn
these patterns by solely minimizing their training loss using gradient-based
methods from random initialization? In this paper, we provide some theoretical
justification of this phenomenon. We propose a spatially structured dataset and
a simplified ViT model. In this model, the attention matrix solely depends on
the positional encodings. We call this mechanism the positional attention
mechanism. On the theoretical side, we consider a binary classification task
and show that while the learning problem admits multiple solutions that
generalize, our model implicitly learns the spatial structure of the dataset
while generalizing: we call this phenomenon patch association. We prove that
patch association helps to sample-efficiently transfer to downstream datasets
that share the same structure as the pre-training one but differ in the
features. Lastly, we empirically verify that a ViT with positional attention
performs similarly to the original one on CIFAR-10/100, SVHN and ImageNet.

complementary information to develop robust perception systems for recognizing

multimodal information and high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a
new novel multimodal neural architecture based on RGB and IMU wearable sensors

Multimodal Temporal Segment Attention Network (MMTSA). MMTSA first employs a
multimodal data isomorphism mechanism based on Gramian Angular Field (GAF) and
then applies a novel multimodal sparse sampling method to reduce redundancy.
Moreover, we propose an inter-segment attention module in MMTSA to fuse
multimodal features effectively and efficiently. We demonstrate the importance
of imu data imaging and attention mechanism in human activity recognition by
rigorous evaluation on three public datasets, and achieve superior improvements

pipelines, computer vision has recently experienced dramatic progress in terms
of accuracy on classic benchmarks such as ImageNet. These highly-accurate
models are challenging to deploy, as they appear harder to compress using
standard techniques such as pruning. We address this issue by introducing the
Correlation Aware Pruner (CAP), a new unstructured pruning framework which
significantly pushes the compressibility limits for state-of-the-art
architectures. Our method is based on two technical advancements: a new
theoretically-justified pruner, which can handle complex weight correlations
accurately and efficiently during the pruning process itself, and an efficient
finetuning procedure for post-compression recovery. We validate our approach
via extensive experiments on several modern vision models such as Vision
Transformers (ViT), modern CNNs, and ViT-CNN hybrids, showing for the first
time that these can be pruned to high sparsity levels (e.g. $\geq 75$%) with
low impact on accuracy ($\leq 1$% relative drop). Our approach is also
compatible with structured pruning and quantization, and can lead to practical
speedups of 1.5 to 2.4x without accuracy loss. To further showcase CAP's
accuracy and scalability, we use it to show for the first time that
extremely-accurate large vision models, trained via self-supervised techniques,
can also be pruned to moderate sparsities, with negligible accuracy loss.

the solar system, this paper proposes a trained convolutional neural network
(CNN) based fault detection scheme to divide the images of photovoltaic
modules. For binary classification, the algorithm classifies the input images
of PV cells into two categories (i.e. faulty or normal). To further assess the
network's capability, the defective PV cells are organized into shadowy,
cracked, or dusty cells, and the model is utilized for multiple
classifications. The success rate for the proposed CNN model is 91.1% for
binary classification and 88.6% for multi-classification. Thus, the proposed
trained CNN model remarkably outperforms the CNN model presented in a previous
study which used the same datasets. The proposed CNN-based fault detection
model is straightforward, simple and effective and could be applied in the
fault detection of solar panel.

warming values obtained from the surface temperature records, ranging between
0.52 and 0.58 $^\circ$C. However, when comparing the observed and GCM
hindcasted warming on land and ocean regions, the surface-based temperature
records appear to exhibit a significant warming bias. If the satellite based
UAH MSU lt record is accurate, actual surface warming from 1980 to 2021 may
have been around 0.40 $^\circ$C (or less), i.e. up to about 30% less than what
is reported by the surface based temperature records. The latter situation
implies that even the low ECS models would have produced excessive warming from
1980 to 2021. These results suggest that the actual ECS may be relatively low,
i.e. lower than 3 $^\circ$C or even less than 2 $^\circ$C. Therefore, the

improve sensor fusion's effectiveness and achieve a step towards
explainability. We evaluate the performance of PULSE on three publicly
available datasets, reducing the mean absolute error by 7.56% on the most
extensive available dataset, PPG-DaLiA. Finally, we demonstrate the
explainability of PULSE and the benefits of applying attention modules to PPG
and motion data.

structural health monitoring of wind turbines. The piezoelectric energy
harvester was made of a polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE)
layer. In addition, PET sheets, double-sided micron-thick tapes, and PVDF
sheets were used for device fabrication. In order to optimize the performance
of the proposed device, the electrical and mechanical characteristics of
PVDF-TrFE material were investigated. Two different piezoelectric energy
harvester devices were designed, fabricated, and compared. A wind test setup
was developed, and the proposed device was characterized by output voltage and
current. Furthermore, a 104 nF capacitance was coupled to the proposed device
to store the generated voltage and run a commercial pressure sensor. The
generated output power of the harvester was sufficient to drive a MEMS pressure
sensor with a maximum current and voltage of 291.34 uA and 937.01 mV,
respectively, under wind pressure giving a power value of 272.99 uW.

due to lower available cooling capacity compares to convection cooled devices.
Therefore, the cooldown time is an important design parameter for conduction
cooled devices. This article introduces a framework developed in Python for
calculating the cooldown profiles and cooldown time of cryocooler
conduction-cooled devices such as superconducting magnets and accelerator
cavities. The cooldown time estimation problem is essentially a system of
ordinary first-order differential equations comprising the material properties
(temperature dependent thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity) of the
components intertwined with the prevailing heat transfer channels (conduction,
radiation, and heat flow across pressed contacts) and the cryocooler capacity.
The formulation of this ODE system is first presented. This ODE system is then
solved using the in-built Python library odeint. A case study is presented
comprising a small cryocooler conduction-cooled copper stabilized
niobium-titanium magnet. The case study is supplemented with the Python script
enabling the reader to simply tweak the device design parameters and optimize
the design from the point of view of slow/fast cooldown.

generation has recently attracted more and more research efforts, where deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed to encode the input images,
and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are used to decode the visual features
into medical reports automatically. However, these state-of-the-art methods
mainly suffer from three shortcomings: (i) incomprehensive optimization, (ii)
low-order and unidimensional attention mechanisms, and (iii) repeated
generation. In this article, we propose a hybrid reinforced medical report
generation method with m-linear attention and repetition penalty mechanism
(HReMRG-MR) to overcome these problems. Specifically, a hybrid reward with
different weights is employed to remedy the limitations of single-metric-based
rewards. We also propose a search algorithm with linear complexity to
approximate the best weight combination. Furthermore, we use m-linear attention
modules to explore high-order feature interactions and to achieve multi-modal
reasoning, while a repetition penalty applies penalties to repeated terms
during the model's training process. Extensive experimental studies on two
public datasets show that HReMRG-MR greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art
baselines in terms of all metrics. We also conducted a series of ablation
experiments to prove the effectiveness of all our proposed components. We also
performed a reward search toy experiment to give evidence that our proposed
search approach can significantly reduce the search time while approximating
the best performance.

  Approach",,,,,"q-fin.CP cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets stored on a blockchain
representing real-world objects such as art or collectibles. An NFT collection
comprises numerous tokens; each token can be transacted multiple times. It is a
multibillion-dollar market where the number of collections has more than
doubled in 2022. In this paper, we want to obtain a generative model that,
given the early transactions history (first quarter Q1) of a newly minted
collection, generates subsequent transactions (quarters Q2, Q3, Q4), where the
generative model is trained using the transaction history of a few mature
collections. The goal is to use the generated transactions to project the
potential market value of this newly minted collection over the next few
quarters. A technical challenge exists in that different collections have
diverse characteristics, and the generative model should generate based on the
appropriate ""contexts"" of the collection. Our method takes a two-step approach.
First, it employs unsupervised learning on the early transactions to extract
characteristics (which we call contexts) of NFT collections. Next, it generates
future transactions of each token based on these contexts and the early
transactions, projecting the target collection's potential market value.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our contextual generative approach's NFT
projection capabilities.

efficiency, where in post execution, they are allocated into individual
accounts. Since Regulators have not mandated any specific post trade allocation
practice or methodology, entities try to rigorously follow internal policies
and procedures to meet the minimum Regulatory ask of being procedurally fair
and equitable. However, as many have found over the years, there is no simple
solution for post trade allocation between accounts that results in a uniform
distribution of returns. Furthermore, in many instances, the divergences
between returns do not dissipate with more transactions, and tend to increase
in some cases. This paper is the first systematic treatment of trade allocation
risk. We shed light on the reasons for return divergence among accounts, and we
present a solution that supports uniform allocation of return irrespective of
number of accounts and trade sizes.

  Explainable Recommendation",,,,,"cs.CL cs.CY cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Personalized text generation has broad industrial applications, such as
explanation generation for recommendations, conversational systems, etc.
Personalized text generators are usually trained on user written text, e.g.,
reviews collected on e-commerce platforms. However, due to historical, social,
or behavioral reasons, there may exist bias that associates certain linguistic
quality of user written text with the users' protected attributes such as
gender, race, etc. The generators can identify and inherit these correlations
and generate texts discriminately w.r.t. the users' protected attributes.
Without proper intervention, such bias can adversarially influence the users'
trust and reliance on the system. From a broader perspective, bias in
auto-generated contents can reinforce the social stereotypes about how online
users write through interactions with the users.
  In this work, we investigate the fairness of personalized text generation in
the setting of explainable recommendation. We develop a general framework for
achieving measure-specific counterfactual fairness on the linguistic quality of
personalized explanations. We propose learning disentangled representations for
counterfactual inference and develop a novel policy learning algorithm with
carefully designed rewards for fairness optimization. The framework can be
applied for achieving fairness on any given specifications of linguistic
quality measures, and can be adapted to most of existing models and real-world
settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior ability of our method
in achieving fairness while maintaining high generation performance.

to as {\em DetChar} activities in this article -- are paramount to the
scientific exploitation of the joint dataset collected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA
global network of ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. They take
place during each phase of the operation of the instruments (upgrade, tuning
and optimization, data taking), are required at all steps of the dataflow (from
data acquisition to the final list of GW events) and operate at various
latencies (from near real-time to vet the public alerts to offline analyses).
This work requires a wide set of tools which have been developed over the years
to fulfill the requirements of the various DetChar studies: data access and
bookkeeping; global monitoring of the instruments and of the different steps of
the data processing; studies of the global properties of the noise at the
detector outputs; identification and follow-up of noise peculiar features
(whether they be transient or continuously present in the data); quick
processing of the public alerts. The present article reviews all the tools used
by the Virgo DetChar group during the third LIGO-Virgo Observation Run (O3,
from April 2019 to March 2020), mainly to analyse the Virgo data acquired at
EGO. Concurrently, a companion article focuses on the results achieved by the
DetChar group during the O3 run using these tools.

Voronoi cells of lattices with known symmetry group. Our algorithm scales
better than linearly with the total number of faces and is applicable to
dimensions beyond 12, which previous methods could not achieve. The new
algorithm is applied to the Coxeter-Todd lattice $K_{12}$ as well as to a
family of lattices obtained from laminating $K_{12}$. By optimizing this
family, we obtain a new best 13-dimensional lattice quantizer (among the
lattices with published exact quantizer constants).

options of actors in agent-based models and its evolution over time. This study
proposes to use affordances as intermediate entities between agents'
environment and agent actions. We illustrated the approach on a typical
gravity-fed network in the South-East of France to explore how the abandonment
of traditional sharing of water changes the irrigators' options to irrigate. We
simulated a typical dry year irrigation season under two institutional
arrangements (i.e. traditional coordination through daily slots and its
abandonment). Simulation results are consistent with field surveys, and reveal
an increase in the number of internal conflicts among irrigators as the
counterpart of the abandonment of traditional sharing of water. They also
highlight the consequences of the heterogeneity of the irrigators' interests
within the collective institution. The sensitivity analysis of the model
allowed identification of optimal modalities of coordination, and a potential
compromise between past and current institutional arrangements. The key
benefits of using affordances in ABM lie in the study of their population
dynamics for characterizing the interaction situations between actors and their
environment and for better understanding the model dynamics.

the evolution of the light pollution until the LEDs started to appear
massively. Another of the issues of dealing with these two datasets is the
different time of acquisition. In general this means that countries get dimmer
late at night, although that is not always true. A counterexample of this is
the country of the Netherlands because of the opening of the shutters late at
night. Other countries have a much bigger drop late at night because of some
practices like the total or partial turn off of public and private lighting but
also dimming policies. Examples of this are countries like France, Austria and
the UK.

solid dynamics suffers from hourglass modes which can grow and lead to the
failure of simulation for problems with large deformation. To address this
long-standing issue, we present an hourglass-free formulation based on
volumetric-devioatric stress decomposition. Inspired by the fact that the
artifact of nonphysical zigzag particle distribution induced by the hourglass
modes is mainly characterized by shear deformation and the standard SPH
discretization for the viscous term in the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation, the
present formulation computes the action of shear stress directly through the
Laplacian of displacement other than from the divergence of shear stress. A
comprehensive set of challenging benchmark cases are simulated to demonstrate
that, while improving accuracy and computational efficiency, the present
formulation is able to eliminate the hourglass modes and achieves very good
numerical stability with a single general effective parameter. In addition, the
deformation of a practically relevant stent structure is simulated to
demonstrate the potential of the present method in the field of biomechanics.
