design learning objectives that can enhance the discrimination of unseen
speakers under unseen domains. This work proposes a supervised contrastive
learning objective to learn a speaker embedding space by effectively leveraging
the label information in the training data. In such a space, utterance pairs
spoken by the same or similar speakers will stay close, while utterance pairs
spoken by different speakers will be far apart. For each training speaker, we
perform random data augmentation on their utterances to form positive pairs,
and utterances from different speakers form negative pairs. To maximize speaker
separability in the embedding space, we incorporate the additive angular-margin
loss into the contrastive learning objective. Experimental results on CN-Celeb
show that this new learning objective can cause ECAPA-TDNN to find an embedding
space that exhibits great speaker discrimination. The contrastive learning
objective is easy to implement, and we provide PyTorch code at

zero-shot learners. However, most existing zero-shot methods involve heavy
human engineering or complicated self-training pipelines, hindering their
application to new situations. In this work, we show that zero-shot text
classification can be improved simply by clustering texts in the embedding
spaces of PLMs. Specifically, we fit the unlabeled texts with a Bayesian
Gaussian Mixture Model after initializing cluster positions and shapes using
class names. Despite its simplicity, this approach achieves superior or
comparable performance on both topic and sentiment classification datasets and
outperforms prior works significantly on unbalanced datasets. We further
explore the applicability of our clustering approach by evaluating it on 14
datasets with more diverse topics, text lengths, and numbers of classes. Our
approach achieves an average of 20% absolute improvement over prompt-based
zero-shot learning. Finally, we compare different PLM embedding spaces and find
that texts are well-clustered by topics even if the PLM is not explicitly
pre-trained to generate meaningful sentence embeddings. This work indicates
that PLM embeddings can categorize texts without task-specific fine-tuning,
thus providing a new way to analyze and utilize their knowledge and zero-shot
learning ability.

  Autoencoder",,,,,"cs.MM cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Across many real-time video applications, we see a growing need (especially
in long delays and dynamic bandwidth) to allow clients to decode each frame
once any (non-empty) subset of its packets is received and improve quality with
each new packet. We call it data-scalable delivery. Unfortunately, existing
techniques (e.g., FEC, RS and Fountain Codes) fall short: they require either
delivery of a minimum number of packets to decode frames, and/or pad video data
with redundancy in anticipation of packet losses, which hurts video quality if
no packets get lost. This work explores a new approach, inspired by recent
advances of neural-network autoencoders, which make data-scalable delivery
possible. We present Grace, a concrete data-scalable real-time video system.
With the same video encoding, Grace's quality is slightly lower than
traditional codec without redundancy when no packet is lost, but with each
missed packet, its quality degrades much more gracefully than existing
solutions, allowing clients to flexibly trade between frame delay and video
quality. Grace makes two contributions: (1) it trains new custom autoencoders
to balance compression efficiency and resilience against a wide range of packet
losses; and (2) it uses a new transmission scheme to deliver autoencoder-coded
frames as individually decodable packets. We test Grace (and traditional
loss-resilient schemes and codecs) on real network traces and videos, and show
that while Grace's compression efficiency is slightly worse than heavily
engineered video codecs, it significantly reduces tail video frame delay (by
2$\times$ at the 95th percentile) with the marginally lowered video quality

potential towards precisely characterizing gastric cancer (GC). Whether using
one-slice 2D annotation or whole-volume 3D annotation remains a long-time
debate, especially for heterogeneous GC. We comprehensively compared 2D and 3D
radiomic features' representation and discrimination capacity regarding GC, via
three tasks.
  Methods: Four-center 539 GC patients were retrospectively enrolled and
divided into the training and validation cohorts. From 2D or 3D regions of
interest (ROIs) annotated by radiologists, radiomic features were extracted
respectively. Feature selection and model construction procedures were customed
for each combination of two modalities (2D or 3D) and three tasks.
Subsequently, six machine learning models (Model_2D^LNM, Model_3D^LNM;
Model_2D^LVI, Model_3D^LVI; Model_2D^pT, Model_3D^pT) were derived and
evaluated to reflect modalities' performances in characterizing GC.
Furthermore, we performed an auxiliary experiment to assess modalities'
performances when resampling spacing is different.
  Results: Regarding three tasks, the yielded areas under the curve (AUCs)
were: Model_2D^LNM's 0.712 (95% confidence interval, 0.613-0.811),
Model_3D^LNM's 0.680 (0.584-0.775); Model_2D^LVI's 0.677 (0.595-0.761),
Model_3D^LVI's 0.615 (0.528-0.703); Model_2D^pT's 0.840 (0.779-0.901),
Model_3D^pT's 0.813 (0.747-0.879). Moreover, the auxiliary experiment indicated
that Models_2D are statistically more advantageous than Models3D with different
resampling spacings.
  Conclusion: Models constructed with 2D radiomic features revealed comparable
performances with those constructed with 3D features in characterizing GC.
  Significance: Our work indicated that time-saving 2D annotation would be the
better choice in GC, and provided a related reference to further
radiomics-based researches.

that these representations have shared and complementary information. This
paper is an attempt to validate these viewpoints computationally. To this end,
we propose a model to jointly predict continuous and discrete emotional

statistically significant improvements in performance over strong baselines

in tasks that use the other type of label. Experimental results and reasoning
for this approach (called the mismatched training approach) are also presented.

i.e., the Cartan geometries modelled on homogeneous spaces $G/P$ with $P$ a
parabolic subgroup in a semi-simple Lie group $G$. Similarly to conformal
Riemannian and projective structures, all these geometries determine a class of
distinguished affine connections, which carry an affine structure modelled on
differential 1-forms $\Upsilon$. They correspond to reductions of $P$ to its
reductive Levi factor, and they are called the Weyl structures similarly to the
conformal case. The standard definition of differential invariants in this
setting is as affine invariants of these connections, which do not depend on
the choice within the class. In this article, we describe a universal calculus

single-photon detectors in conjunction with temporal or spatial mode
multiplexing. Yet, these methods suffer from an inherent trade-off between the
efficiency of photon number discrimination and photon detection rate. Here, we
introduce a method of photon number resolving detection that overcomes these
limitations by replacing mode multiplexing with coherent absorption of a single
optical mode in a distributed detector array. Distributed coherent absorption
ensures complete and uniform absorption of light among the constituent
detectors, enabling fast and efficient photon number resolution. As a
proof-of-concept, we consider the case of a distributed array of
superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors with realistic parameters and
show that deterministic absorption and arbitrarily high photon number
discrimination efficiency can be achieved by increasing the number of detectors
in the array. Photon number resolution without optical mode multiplication
provides a simple yet effective method to discriminate an arbitrary number of
photons in large arrays of on-off detectors or in smaller arrays of mode
multiplexed detectors.

the mean-field approximation fails catastrophically to describe

to address issues like slow convergence, low final accuracy, and bias in FL,

cohorts among large-scale, low-participation, and resource-constrained FL
populations. Auxo then adaptively determines how to train cohort-specific
models in order to achieve better model performance and ensure resource

acquisition method that has been proposed and studied rigorously in the past
decade. In 1bCS, linear samples of a high dimensional signal are quantized to
only one bit per sample (sign of the measurement). Assuming the original signal
vector to be sparse, existing results in 1bCS either aim to find the support of
the vector, or approximate the signal allowing a small error. The focus of this
paper is support recovery, which often also computationally facilitate
approximate signal recovery. A {\em universal} measurement matrix for 1bCS
refers to one set of measurements that work for all sparse signals. With
universality, it is known that $\tilde{\Theta}(k^2)$ 1bCS measurements are
necessary and sufficient for support recovery (where $k$ denotes the sparsity).
To improve the dependence on sparsity from quadratic to linear, in this work we
propose approximate support recovery (allowing $\epsilon>0$ proportion of
errors), and superset recovery (allowing $\epsilon$ proportion of false
positives). We show that the first type of recovery is possible with
$\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon)$ measurements, while the later type of recovery, more
challenging, is possible with $\tilde{O}(\max\{k/\epsilon,k^{3/2}\})$
measurements. We also show that in both cases $\Omega(k/\epsilon)$ measurements
would be necessary for universal recovery.
  Improved results are possible if we consider universal recovery within a
restricted class of signals, such as rational signals, or signals with bounded
dynamic range. In both cases superset recovery is possible with only
$\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon)$ measurements. Other results on universal but
approximate support recovery are also provided in this paper. All of our main
recovery algorithms are simple and polynomial-time.

the training loss beyond the zero training error point. In this phase of
training, a ""neural collapse"" behavior has been observed: the variability of
features (outputs of the penultimate layer) of within-class samples decreases
and the mean features of different classes approach a certain tight frame
structure. Recent works analyze this behavior via idealized unconstrained
features models where all the minimizers exhibit exact collapse. However, with
practical networks and datasets, the features typically do not reach exact
collapse, e.g., because deep layers cannot arbitrarily modify intermediate
features that are far from being collapsed. In this paper, we propose a richer
model that can capture this phenomenon by forcing the features to stay in the
vicinity of a predefined features matrix (e.g., intermediate features). We
explore the model in the small vicinity case via perturbation analysis and
establish results that cannot be obtained by the previously studied models. For
example, we prove reduction in the within-class variability of the optimized
features compared to the predefined input features (via analyzing gradient flow
on the ""central-path"" with minimal assumptions), analyze the minimizers in the
near-collapse regime, and provide insights on the effect of regularization
hyperparameters on the closeness to collapse. We support our theory with

eigenvalues through eigenvalue amplification, as well as by increasing the
accuracy of the controlled rotation angular coefficients, which are the
critical factors in the HHL algorithm. Consequently, we are able to drastically
reduce the relative error in the solution while achieving higher success

phenomena entails theory for dynamic fractal phenomena capturing their fractal

brain, heart, and lung organ networks, which are directly related to their
inter-network and intra-network interactions. Moreover, these same physiologic
organ networks have been shown to generate crucial event (CE) time series, and
herein are shown, using modified diffusion entropy analysis (MDEA), to have
scaling indices with quasiperiodic changes in complexity, as measured by
scaling indices, over time. Such time series are generated by different parts
of the brain, heart, and lung organ networks, and the results do not depend on
the underlying coherence properties of the associated time series but
demonstrate a generalized synchronization of complexity. This high order
synchrony among the scaling indices of EEG (brain), ECG (heart), and
respiratory time series is governed by the quantitative interdependence of the
multifractal behavior of the various physiological organs' network dynamics.
This consequence of the NE opens the door for an entirely general
characterization of the dynamics of complex networks in terms of complexity
synchronization (CS) independently of the scientific, engineering, or

theory and its ability to describe strongly-coupled quantum many-body systems
of finite size. Collective behaviors can be efficiently described in such
systems through the implementation of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in
mean-field approaches. However, as the thermodynamic limit does not make sense
in finite-size systems, the latter can not exhibit any SSB and the symmetries
which are broken down at the mean-field level must therefore be restored. The
efficiency of theoretical approaches in the treatment of finite-size quantum
systems can therefore be studied via their ability to restore spontaneously
broken symmetries. In this thesis, a zero-dimensional $O(N)$ model is taken as
a theoretical laboratory to perform such an investigation with many
state-of-the-art path-integral techniques: perturbation theory combined with
various resummation methods (Pad\'e-Borel, Borel-hypergeometric, conformal
mapping), enhanced versions of perturbation theory (transseries derived via
Lefschetz thimbles, optimized perturbation theory), self-consistent
perturbation theory based on effective actions (auxiliary field loop expansion
(LOAF), Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism, 4PPI effective action, ...),
functional renormalization group (FRG) techniques (FRG based on the Wetterich
equation, DFT-FRG, 2PI-FRG). Connections between these different techniques are
also emphasized. In addition, the path-integral formalism provides us with the
possibility to introduce collective degrees of freedom in an exact fashion via
Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations: the effect of such transformations on all
the aforementioned methods is also examined in detail.

optimization with multi-start methods. To perform theoretical performance
analysis, we focus on the random multi-start (RMS) method, one of the
representative multi-start methods including the RMS local search and the
greedy randomized adaptive search procedure. Our main theoretical contribution
is to derive two power-law formulas by extreme value theory. One is for the
expected improvement rate (EIR) of the best empirical objective value (EOV),
and the other is for the expected relative gap (ERG) of the best EOV to the
supremum of empirical objective values (SEV). Notably, the ERG has
scale-freeness as a function of the number of iterations. Thus, the half-life
of the relative gap of the best EOV is eventually proportional to the number of
completed iterations by an RMS algorithm. This result can be understood as the
curse of scale-freeness: the phenomenon ""as trying to get closer to the goal,
it is getting further away."" Through numerical experiments, we observe that
applying several RMS algorithms to traveling salesman problems is subject to
the curse of scale-freeness. We also show that overcoming the curse of
scale-freeness requires developing an algorithm that accelerates exponentially
its performance relative to the RMS method.

sources. On one hand, due to distributional shifts between training data and
test data, the trained model could exhibit poor out-of-sample performance. On
the other hand, a portion of working nodes might be subject to byzantine
attacks which could invalidate the learning result. Existing works mostly deal
with these two issues separately. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm
that equips distributed learning with robustness measures against both
distributional shifts and byzantine attacks. Our algorithm is built on recent
advances in distributionally robust optimization as well as norm-based
screening (NBS), a robust aggregation scheme against byzantine attacks. We
provide convergence proofs in three cases of the learning model being
nonconvex, convex, and strongly convex for the proposed algorithm, shedding
light on its convergence behaviors and endurability against byzantine attacks.
In particular, we deduce that any algorithm employing NBS (including ours)
cannot converge when the percentage of byzantine nodes is 1/3 or higher,
instead of 1/2, which is the common belief in current literature. The
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm against
both robustness issues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
address distributional shifts and byzantine attacks simultaneously.

the world. Many numerical weather prediction models provide deterministic
forecasts with limited measures of their forecast uncertainty. Standard
postprocessing techniques may struggle with extreme events or use a 30-day
training window that will not adequately characterize the uncertainty of a
tropical cyclone forecast. We propose a novel approach that leverages
information from past storm events, using a hierarchical model to quantify
uncertainty in the spatial correlation parameters of the forecast errors
(modeled as Gaussian processes) for a numerical weather prediction model. This
approach addresses a massive data problem by implementing a drastic dimension
reduction through the assumption that the MLE and Hessian matrix represent all
useful information from each tropical cyclone. From this, simulated forecast
errors provide uncertainty quantification for future tropical cyclone
forecasts. We apply this method to the North American Mesoscale model forecasts
and use observations based on the Stage IV data product for 47 tropical
cyclones between 2004 and 2017. For an incoming storm, our hierarchical
framework combines the forecast from the North American Mesoscale model with
the information from previous storms to create 95\% and 99\% prediction maps of
rain. For six test storms from 2018 and 2019, these maps provide appropriate
probabilistic coverage of observations. We show evidence from the log scoring
rule that the proposed hierarchical framework performs best among competing
methods.

effect to the overall treatment effect. One critical aspect of this approach is
that prior choice on the variance plays a major role in determining the

We review the priors most commonly adopted in previous works and compare them
with the recently introduced penalized complexity (PC) priors. Our simulation
study shows comparable behaviour for the PC prior and the gold standard choice
half-t prior, with the former performing better in the homogeneous scenario

strong evidence that stoichiometric, defect-free Cu$_3$P is an intrinsic
semimetal, i.e., a material with a small overlap between the valence and the
conduction band. On the other hand, experimentally realizable Cu$_{3-x}$P films
are always p-type semimetals natively doped by copper vacancies regardless of
$x$. It is not implausible that Cu$_{3-x}$P samples with very small
characteristic sizes (such as small nanoparticles) are semiconductors due to
quantum confinement effects that result in opening of a band gap. We observe
high hole mobilities (276 cm$^2$/Vs) in Cu$_{3-x}$P films at low temperatures,
pointing to low ionized impurity scattering rates in spite of a high doping
density. We report an optical effect equivalent to the Burstein-Moss shift, and
we assign an infrared absorption peak to bulk interband transitions rather than
to a surface plasmon resonance. From a materials processing perspective, this
study demonstrates the suitability of reactive sputter deposition for detailed
high-throughput studies of emerging metal phosphides.

isotropic swelling, a source of isotropic stress. We compare our theoretical
results with experimental measurements of angle-dependent deviatoric and

of angle-independent isotropic stress and the relationship between the

critical angle selection, while the influence of inhomogeneous stress
modification is seemingly non-existent in the idealized case of
diagonally-translated interface and stress generated entirely along a thin,

interfaces defined by vertical translation, with stress modification along the
vertical regardless of beam orientation. The unacceptable variability in
predictions resulting from these two idealizations, both of which have appeared

resilience against any attacks on communication networks is important to
guarantee the digital sovereignty of our society. New developments of
communication networks tackle the problem of resilience by in-network computing
approaches for higher protocol layers, while the physical layer remains an open
problem. This is particularly true for wireless communication systems which are
inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to the open nature of the
wireless medium. In denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, an active adversary is
able to completely disrupt the communication and it has been shown that Turing
machines are incapable of detecting such attacks. As Turing machines provide
the fundamental limits of digital information processing and therewith of
digital twins, this implies that even the most powerful digital twins that
preserve all information of the physical network error-free are not capable of
detecting such attacks. This stimulates the question of how powerful the
information processing hardware must be to enable the detection of DoS attacks.
Therefore, in the paper the need of neuromorphic twins is advocated and by the
use of Blum-Shub-Smale machines a first implementation that enables the
detection of DoS attacks is shown. This result holds for both cases of with and
without constraints on the input and jamming sequences of the adversary.

energetic solar protons in ""gradual"" solar energetic-particle (SEP) events
resulting from the spatial variations in the shock waves that accelerate them.
Differences in the shock strength at the solar longitude of a spacecraft and at
the footpoint of its connecting magnetic field line, nominally 55 degrees to
the west, drive much of that variation. The shock wave itself, together with
energetic particles trapped near it by self-amplified Alfven waves, forms an
underlying autonomous structure that can drive across magnetic field lines
intact, spreading proton intensities in a widening SEP longitude distribution.
During the formation of this fundamental structure, historically called an
""energetic storm particle"" (ESP) event, many SEPs leak away early, amplifying
waves as they flow along well-connected field lines and broaden the
distribution outward; behind this structure between the shock and the Sun a
""reservoir"" of quasi-trapped SEPs forms. Very large SEP events are complicated
by additional extensive wave growth that can spread an extended ESP-like
trapping region. The multiplicity of shock-related processes contributing to
the observed SEP profiles causes correlations of the events to be poorly
represented by the peak intensities commonly used. In fact, the extensive
spatial distributions of SEPs are sometimes interwoven with the structures of
the shocks that have accelerated them and sometimes free. We should consider
new questions: Which extremes of the shock contribute most to the SEPs profile
of an event, (1) the shock at the longitude of a spacecraft, (2) the shock ~55

equations, requires the identification of its missing constraints. An efficient
class of structural methods exploiting a dependency graph for this task was
initiated by Pantiledes. More complete methods rely on differential-algebraic
geometry but suffer from other issues (e.g. high complexity). In this paper we
give a new class of efficient structural methods combined with new tools from
numerical real algebraic geometry that has much improved completeness
properties. Existing structural methods may fail for a system of
differential-algebraic equations if its Jacobian matrix after differentiation
is still singular due to symbolic cancellation or numerical degeneration.
Existing structural methods can only handle degenerated cases caused by
symbolic cancellation. However, if a system has parameters, then its parametric
Jacobian matrix may be still singular after application of the structural
method for certain values of the parameters. This case is called numerical
degeneration.
  For polynomially nonlinear systems of differential-algebraic equations,
numerical methods are given to solve both degenerated cases using numerical
real algebraic geometry. First, we introduce a witness point method, which
produces at least one witness point on every constraint component. This can
help to ensure constant rank and detection of degeneration on all components of
such systems. Secondly, we present a Constant Rank Embedding Lemma, and based
on it propose an Index Reduction by Embedding (IRE) method which can construct
an equivalent system with a full rank Jacobian matrix. Thirdly, IRE leads to a
global structural differentiation method, to solve degenerated
differential-algebraic equations on all components numerically. Application
examples from circuits, mechanics, are used to demonstrate our method.

decreasing computational costs for simulation as well as for model-based
control approaches. This work presents a data-driven framework for
minimal-dimensional models that effectively capture the dynamics and properties
of the flow. We apply this to Kolmogorov flow in a regime consisting of chaotic
and intermittent behavior, which is common in many flows processes and is
challenging to model. The trajectory of the flow travels near relative periodic
orbits (RPOs), interspersed with sporadic bursting events corresponding to
excursions between the regions containing the RPOs. The first step in
development of the models is use of an undercomplete autoencoder to map from
the full state data down to a latent space of dramatically lower dimension.
Then models of the discrete-time evolution of the dynamics in the latent space
are developed. By analyzing the model performance as a function of latent space
dimension we can estimate the minimum number of dimensions required to capture
the system dynamics. To further reduce the dimension of the dynamical model, we
factor out a phase variable in the direction of translational invariance for
the flow, leading to separate evolution equations for the pattern and phase
dynamics. At a model dimension of five for the pattern dynamics, as opposed to
the full state dimension of 1024 (i.e. a 32x32 grid), accurate predictions are
found for individual trajectories out to about two Lyapunov times, as well as
for long-time statistics. The nearly heteroclinic connections between the
different RPOs, including the quiescent and bursting time scales, are well
captured. We also capture key features of the phase dynamics. Finally, we use
the low-dimensional representation to predict future bursting events, finding
good success.

than the coherence time, which for superconducting circuits is in the
microsecond range. Developing and training a deep reinforcement learning agent
able to operate in this real-time feedback regime has been an open challenge.
Here, we have implemented such an agent in the form of a latency-optimized deep
neural network on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). We demonstrate its
use to efficiently initialize a superconducting qubit into a target state. To
train the agent, we use model-free reinforcement learning that is based solely
on measurement data. We study the agent's performance for strong and weak
measurements, and for three-level readout, and compare with simple strategies
based on thresholding. This demonstration motivates further research towards
adoption of reinforcement learning for real-time feedback control of quantum
devices and more generally any physical system requiring learnable low-latency
feedback control.

wirelessly charge one multi-antenna energy harvesting (EH) receiver, and
perform radar sensing for a point target based on the echo signal at the same

limits of sensing, communication, and powering, in terms of the estimation
Cram{\'e}r-Rao bound (CRB), achievable communication rate, and harvested energy

the maximum transmit power constraint at the H-AP. We obtain the
semi-closed-form optimal transmit covariance solution to the formulated problem

Besides quantum for ML, we want to raise the community's attention on the
reversed direction: ML for quantum. Specifically, the TorchQuantum library also
supports using data-driven ML models to solve problems in quantum system
research, such as predicting the impact of quantum noise on circuit fidelity
and improving the quantum circuit compilation efficiency.
  This paper presents a case study of the ML for quantum part. Since estimating
the noise impact on circuit reliability is an essential step toward
understanding and mitigating noise, we propose to leverage classical ML to
predict noise impact on circuit fidelity. Inspired by the natural graph
representation of quantum circuits, we propose to leverage a graph transformer
model to predict the noisy circuit fidelity. We firstly collect a large dataset
with a variety of quantum circuits and obtain their fidelity on noisy
simulators and real machines. Then we embed each circuit into a graph with gate

the fidelity.
  Evaluated on 5 thousand random and algorithm circuits, the graph transformer
predictor can provide accurate fidelity estimation with RMSE error 0.04 and
outperform a simple neural network-based model by 0.02 on average. It can
achieve 0.99 and 0.95 R$^2$ scores for random and algorithm circuits,

potentially an elegant solution for the dynamic out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words
problem, where speaker- and context-dependent named entities like contact names
must be incorporated into the ASR on-the-fly for every speech utterance at
testing time. Challenges still remain, however, in improving the overall
accuracy of embedding-matching A2W. In this paper, we contribute two methods
that improve the accuracy of embedding-matching A2W. First, we propose
internally producing multiple embeddings, instead of a single embedding, at
each instance in time, which allows the A2W model to propose a richer set of
hypotheses over multiple time segments in the audio. Second, we propose using
word pronunciation embeddings rather than word orthography embeddings to reduce
ambiguities introduced by words that have more than one sound. We show that the
above ideas give significant accuracy improvement, with the same training data

crucial role. On a dataset of queries to a speech-based digital assistant that
include many user-dependent contact names, we observe up to 18% decrease in

Common Label Set (CLS) exploits this idea and maps graphemes of various

mostly phonetic, building a parser to convert from native script to CLS is
easy. In this paper, we explore various approaches to build multilingual ASR

building multilingual systems that use both CLS and native script labels. We

modalities, where speech is continuous while text is discrete, we first
discretize speech into a sequence of discrete speech tokens to solve the
modality mismatch problem. Secondly, to solve the length mismatch problem,
where the speech sequence is usually much longer than text sequence, we convert
the words of text into phoneme sequences and randomly repeat each phoneme in
the sequences. Finally, we feed the discrete speech and text tokens into a
modality-agnostic Transformer encoder and pre-train with token-level masking
language modeling (tMLM). Experiments show that token2vec is significantly
superior to various speech-only pre-training baselines, with up to 17.7%
relative WER reduction. Token2vec model is also validated on a non-ASR task,

radio-quiet quasars (RQQs), using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 5 GHz.
Ten RQQs are clearly detected in the VLBA images, and a compact radio core is
identified in eight of them, indicating the prevalence of active galactic
nucleus (AGN)-related radio emission in this flux-density-limited RQQ sample.
The RQQs and RLQs in our sample have a division at $\sim$30~mJy. The radio
emission from RQQs appears to be the result of a combination of star formation
and AGN-associated activities. All RQQs in our sample have a 5 GHz flux density
ratio of Very Large Array (VLA) A-array to D-array $f_{\rm c} = S_{\rm A}^{\rm
VLA}/S_{\rm D}^{\rm VLA}$ above 0.2. The RQQs with $f_a$ (VLBA and VLA flux
density ratio $S^{\rm VLBA}/S_{\rm A}^{\rm VLA}) > 0.2$ versus $f_a < 0.2$ show
significant differences in morphology, compactness and total flux density.
$f_{\rm a}$ of RQQs is systematically lower than that of RLQs, probably due to
the extended jets or relic jets of RQQs on 10s to 100s parsecs which are
resolved out in VLBA images. Future larger samples, especially with the
addition of milli-arcsec resolution radio images of RQQs with total flux
densities below 1 mJy, can test the conclusions of this paper and contributes
to the understanding of the radio emission mechanism of RQQs, and the dichotomy
and physical connection between RQQs and RLQs.

to generate adversarial patches that are adaptive in both physical dynamics and
varying scales, and by which the particular targets can be hidden from being
detected. Furthermore, the adversarial patch is also gifted with attack
effectiveness against all targets of the same class with a patch outside the
target (No need to smear targeted objects) and robust enough in the physical

information of detected objects to optimize the adversarial patch, which can
significantly improve the patch's attack efficacy (Average precision drop up to
87.86% and 85.48% in white-box and black-box settings, respectively) and
optimizing efficiency. We also establish one of the first comprehensive,
coherent, and rigorous benchmarks to evaluate the attack efficacy of
adversarial patches on aerial detection tasks. Finally, several proportionally

adversarial patches can successfully deceive aerial detection algorithms in

FWI with the 2015/16 Gorgon OBN case study in the NorthWestern shelf,
Australia. We solve the forward problem with the massively-parallel
multifrontal direct solver MUMPS, which includes four key features to reach
high computational efficiency: An efficient parallelism combining

With the ever-increasing requirement of high data rate and ubiquitous devices,
effective wideband DoA estimation is desirable. In this paper, we propose an
iterative coherent signal-subspace method including three steps in each
iteration for two-dimensional (2D) DoA estimation with a uniform circular
array. The first step selects partial frequency points for the subsequent
focusing process to reduce unnecessary complexity. The second step realizes the
focusing process, where we provide angle intervals to generate focusing
matrices with robustness, and the signal-subspaces at the selected frequency
points are focused into a reference frequency. The third step estimates DoAs
with the multiple signal classification algorithm where the range of the
spatial spectrum is constrained by the aforementioned angle intervals, thereby
further reducing the complexity. The key parameters of the proposed method in
the current iteration are adjusted based on the previous estimation results. In
addition, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao bound of the investigated wideband 2D DoA
estimation to provide guidance for practical applications. The simulation
results indicate that our proposed method enjoys better performance and

distilled data with exponential informativeness gain, which largely increase
the representation capability of distilled datasets. To furthermore increase
the data efficiency of compression results, we further introduce a pair of
adversarial contrastive constraints on the resultant hallucination networks and
bases, which increase the diversity of generated images and inject more
discriminant information into the factorization. Extensive comparisons and
experiments demonstrate that our method can yield significant improvement on
downstream classification tasks compared with previous state of the arts, while
reducing the total number of compressed parameters by up to 65\%. Moreover,

of traffic flow traveling in a road network, so it is important to model the
spatial dependence of the road network. The essence of spatial dependence is to
accurately describe how traffic information transmission is affected by other
nodes in the road network, and the GNN-based traffic prediction model, as a
benchmark for traffic prediction, has become the most common method for the
ability to model spatial dependence by transmitting traffic information with
the message passing mechanism. However, existing methods model a local and
static spatial dependence, which cannot transmit the global-dynamic traffic
information (GDTi) required for long-term prediction. The challenge is the
difficulty of detecting the precise transmission of GDTi due to the uncertainty
of individual transport, especially for long-term transmission. In this paper,
we propose a new hypothesis\: GDTi behaves macroscopically as a transmitting
causal relationship (TCR) underlying traffic flow, which remains stable under
dynamic changing traffic flow. We further propose spatial-temporal Granger
causality (STGC) to express TCR, which models global and dynamic spatial
dependence. To model global transmission, we model the causal order and causal
lag of TCRs global transmission by a spatial-temporal alignment algorithm. To
capture dynamic spatial dependence, we approximate the stable TCR underlying
dynamic traffic flow by a Granger causality test. The experimental results on
three backbone models show that using STGC to model the spatial dependence has
better results than the original model for 45 min and 1 h long-term prediction.

sentence pairs as the supervised signals. Despite the use of large-scale
unlabeled data, the performance of unsupervised methods typically lags far
behind that of the supervised counterparts in most downstream tasks. In this
work, we propose a semi-supervised sentence embedding framework, GenSE, that
effectively leverages large-scale unlabeled data. Our method include three
parts: 1) Generate: A generator/discriminator model is jointly trained to
synthesize sentence pairs from open-domain unlabeled corpus; 2) Discriminate:
Noisy sentence pairs are filtered out by the discriminator to acquire
high-quality positive and negative sentence pairs; 3) Contrast: A prompt-based
contrastive approach is presented for sentence representation learning with
both annotated and synthesized data. Comprehensive experiments show that GenSE
achieves an average correlation score of 85.19 on the STS datasets and
consistent performance improvement on four domain adaptation tasks,
significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art methods and convincingly
corroborating its effectiveness and generalization ability.Code, Synthetic data

Rotors are phasors where the imaginary number has been replaced by a oriented
plane element of unit area called a unit bivector. The algebra in three
dimensional space relating vectors and bivectors is the Pauli algebra.
Multivectors consisting of linear combinations of scalars and bivectors are
isomorphic to quaternions. The rotational dynamics can be expressed entirely in
the plane of rotation using bivectors. In particular, the Poisson formula
providing the time derivative of the unit vectors of a moving frame are recast
in terms of the angular velocity bivector and applied to cylindrical and
spherical frames. The rotational dynamics of a point particle and a rigid body
are fully determined by the time evolution of rotors. The mapping of the
angular velocity bivector onto the angular momentum bivector is the inertia
map. In the principal axis frame of the rigid body, the inertia map is
characterised by symmetric coefficients representing the moments of inertia.
The Huygens-Steiner theorem, the kinetic energy of a rigid body and the Euler
equations are expressed in terms of bivector components. This formalism is
applied to study the rotational dynamics of a gyroscope.

platform to study the combined effect of lattice frustration and an effective
magnetic flux close to one flux quantum per particle. The minimal theoretical
model to accomplish this task is a system of spinless noninteracting fermions
on a triangular two-chain flux ladder. In this paper we consider this model
close to half-filling, with interchain hopping amplitudes alternating along the
zigzag bonds of the ladder and being small. In such setting qualitative changes
in the ground state properties of the model, most notably the flux-induced
topological Lifshitz transitions are shifted towards the values of the flux per
a diatomic plaquette ($f$) close to the flux quantum ($f\sim 1/2$). Geometrical
frustration of the lattice breaks the $k \to \pi - k$ particle-hole spectral
symmetry present in non-frustrated ladders, and leads to splitting of the
degeneracies at metal-insulator transitions. A remarkable feature of a
translationally invariant triangular ladder is the appearance of isolated Dirac
node at the Brillouin zone boundary, rendering the ground state at $f=1/2$
semi-metallic. We calculate the flux dependence of the orbital current and
identify Lifshitz critical points by the singularities in this dependence at a
constant chemical potential $\mu$ and constant particle density $\rho$. The
absence of the particle-hole symmetry in the triangular ladder leads to the
asymmetry between particle ($\rho>1$) and hole ($\rho<1$) doping and to
qualitatively different results for the phase diagram, Lifshitz points and the
flux dependence of the orbital current in the settings $\rho={\rm const}$ and
$\mu={\rm const}$.

region of galaxy clusters due to supersonic gas infall from filaments and voids
in the cosmic web. They are characterized by high sonic and Alfv\'enic Mach
numbers, $M_s\sim10-10^2$ and $M_A\sim10^2-10^3$, and propagate into weakly
magnetized plasmas of $\beta\equiv P_g/P_B\gtrsim10^2$. Although strong
accretion shocks are expected to be efficient accelerators of cosmic rays
(CRs), nonthermal signatures of shock-accelerated CRs around clusters have not
been confirmed, and detailed acceleration physics at such shocks has yet to be
understood. In this study, we first establish through two-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations that at strong high-$\beta$ shocks electrons can
be pre-energized via stochastic Fermi acceleration owing to the ion-Weibel
instability in the shock transition region, possibly followed by injection into
diffusive shock acceleration. Hence, we propose that the models derived from
conventional thermal leakage injection may be employed for the acceleration of
electrons and ions at accretion shocks as well. Applying these analytic models
to numerical shock zones identified in structure formation simulations, we
estimate nonthermal radiation, such as synchrotron and inverse-Compton (IC)
emission due to CR electrons, and $\pi^0$-decay $\gamma$-rays due to CR
protons, around simulated clusters. Our models with the injection parameter,
$Q\approx3.5-3.8$, predict synthetic synchrotron maps, which seem consistent
with recent radio observations of the Coma cluster. However, the detection of
nonthermal IC X-rays and $\gamma$-rays from accretion shocks would be quite
challenging. We suggest that the proposed analytic models may be adopted as
generic recipes for CR production at cosmological shocks.

current continuous authentication methods suffer some limitations: 1)
behavioral biometrics from impostors are needed to train continuous

scenarios; 2) most deep learning-based continuous authentication methods need
to train two models to improve authentication performance. A deep learning

plenty of embodied navigation tasks and task-specific solutions, we address a

not one but multiple navigation tasks concurrently? First, we propose VXN, a
large-scale 3D dataset that instantiates four classic navigation tasks in
standardized, continuous, and audiovisual-rich environments. Second, we propose
Vienna, a versatile embodied navigation agent that simultaneously learns to
perform the four navigation tasks with one model. Building upon a
full-attentive architecture, Vienna formulates various navigation tasks as a
unified, parse-and-query procedure: the target description, augmented with four
task embeddings, is comprehensively interpreted into a set of diversified goal
vectors, which are refined as the navigation progresses, and used as queries to
retrieve supportive context from episodic history for decision making. This
enables the reuse of knowledge across navigation tasks with varying input

each visual navigation task individually, our multitask agent achieves
comparable or even better performance with reduced complexity.

variational quantum circuit (VQC) and demonstrated the quantum advantages in
the small drug discovery. Utilizing a VQC in the noise generator of a GAN to
generate small molecules achieves better physicochemical properties and
performance in the goal-directed benchmark than the classical counterpart.
Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of a VQC with only tens of learnable

demonstrate the quantum advantage of a VQC in the discriminator of GAN. In this
hybrid model, the number of learnable parameters is significantly less than the
classical ones, and it can still generate valid molecules. The hybrid model
with only tens of training parameters in the quantum discriminator outperforms
the MLP-based one in terms of both generated molecule properties and the

developed to perform segmentation with just a few annotated examples. In this
work, we tackle the few-shot segmentation using a self-regularized prototypical
network (SRPNet) based on prototype extraction for better utilization of the
support information. The proposed SRPNet extracts class-specific prototype
representations from support images and generates segmentation masks for query
images by a distance metric - the fidelity. A direct yet effective prototype
regularization on support set is proposed in SRPNet, in which the generated
prototypes are evaluated and regularized on the support set itself. The extent
to which the generated prototypes restore the support mask imposes an upper
limit on performance. The performance on the query set should never exceed the
upper limit no matter how complete the knowledge is generalized from support
set to query set. With the specific prototype regularization, SRPNet fully
exploits knowledge from the support and offers high-quality prototypes that are
representative for each semantic class and meanwhile discriminative for
different classes. The query performance is further improved by an iterative
query inference (IQI) module that combines a set of regularized prototypes. Our
proposed SRPNet achieves new state-of-art performance on 1-shot and 5-shot
segmentation benchmarks.

Two indices, $R_{\rm{H\alpha}}^{'}$ and $R_{\rm{H\alpha}}^{+}$, are computed

photospheric contributions to the $\rm{H_{\alpha}}$ lines, while the latter is
derived by further subtracting the non-dynamo driven chromospheric emission.
Meanwhile, the periodicity and variation amplitudes are computed from \emph{K2}
light curves. Both the $R_{\rm{H\alpha}}^{'}$-Ro relation and
$R_{\rm{H\alpha}}^{+}$-Ro relation show complicated profiles in the
non-saturated decay region. Hot stars show flatter slopes and higher activity
level than cool stars, and the behaviour is more notable in the
$R_{\rm{H\alpha}}^{+}$-$R_{o}$ relation. This is consistent with recent studies
using other activity proxies, including $L_{\rm{x}}/L_{\rm{bol}}$,
$R_{\rm{HK}}^{'}$ and amplitudes of optical light curves. % This may suggest
different kinds of stars follow different power laws in the decay region. Most
of our targets have multiple observations, and some of them exhibit significant
variability of ${\rm{H\alpha}}$ emissions, which may cause the large scatters
shown in the decay region. We find three targets exhibiting positive
correlation in rotational phase, possibly indicating that their optical light
curves are dominated by hot faculae rather than cool starspots.

investigate the simultaneous multiple angular displacement estimation based on

correlation of the probe state, this allows us to give a reasonable explanation

angular displacement estimation is always positively related to the intramode
correlation, especially for the multimode entangled squeezed vacuum state
showing the best performance compared to another probe state. More importantly,
strengthening the robustness of multiple angular-displacement estimation
systems can be achieved by increasing the OAM quantum number.

unseen tasks without sufficient annotations. Despite the emergence of a number
of few-shot learning methods, the sample selection bias problem, i.e., the
sensitivity to the limited amount of support data, has not been well
understood. In this paper, we find that this problem usually occurs when the
positions of support samples are in the vicinity of task centroid -- the mean
of all class centroids in the task. This motivates us to propose an extremely
simple feature transformation to alleviate this problem, dubbed Task Centroid
Projection Removing (TCPR). TCPR is applied directly to all image features in a
given task, aiming at removing the dimension of features along the direction of
the task centroid. While the exact task centroid cannot be accurately obtained
from limited data, we estimate it using base features that are each similar to
one of the support features. Our method effectively prevents features from
being too close to the task centroid. Extensive experiments over ten datasets
from different domains show that TCPR can reliably improve classification
accuracy across various feature extractors, training algorithms and datasets.

collecting high-quality such a dataset in most scenarios is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method to
automatically augment high-quality responses with different semantics by
counterfactual inference. Specifically, given an observed dialogue, our
counterfactual generation model first infers semantically different responses
by replacing the observed reply perspective with substituted ones. Furthermore,
our data selection method filters out detrimental augmented responses.
Experimental results show that our data augmentation method can augment
high-quality responses with different semantics for a given dialogue history,
and can outperform competitive baselines on multiple downstream tasks.

stresses and temperatures is crucial for design using nickel-base superalloys
for high-temperature applications. In this study, the creep behaviour of a
newly designed superalloy (nominated Alloy 11) at different stress and
temperature was systematically investigated using SEM, STEM, EBSD and
synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Material properties and mechanical response were
analysed by considering such properties as lattice parameters and misfit, phase
volume fraction, microstrain in reference and crept samples. Detwinning and
dynamic recrystallization were observed for the crept samples. STEM
characterization of deformed materials reveals that multiple deformation
mechanisms and defects could be identified in crept samples, namely,
dislocations in the gamma matrix channels and in gamma prime precipitates,
along with continuous and isolated stacking faults. The highest values of
lattice misfit, microstrain and lattice parameter change were observed at the
centre of dogbone-shaped crept samples. This was associated with the hump
shaped temperature distribution profile during creep testing. The significant
spatial variation detected in terms of lattice parameters, misfit and
microstrain supports the conclusion that it is important to perform spatially
resolved measurements instead of considering each sample as a single
measurement point when investigating creep response. It is also worth noting
that the statistics of the lattice-parameter distribution for the gamma and
gamma prime phases obey a gaussian distribution. In conclusion, a discussion is
given for the meaning and implications of these findings for future research.

necessity of taking a specific action. In Linguistic terms, they are steps to
achieve an operation, often through the usage of action verbs. For example, the
sentence, `Get your homework finished by tomorrow` qualifies as actionable
since it demands a specific action (In this case, finishing homework) to be
taken. In contrast, a simple sentence such as, `I like to play the guitar` does
not qualify as an actionable phrase since it simply states a personal choice of
the person instead of demanding a task to be finished.
  In this paper, the aim is to explore if Actionables can be extracted from raw
text using Linguistic filters designed from scratch. These filters are
specially catered to identifying actionable text using Transfer Learning as the
lead role. Actionable Detection can be used in detecting emergency tasks during

singularity. Although it is often believed that quantum gravity would ""cure""
the singularity, as emphasized by Penrose, this viewpoint requires a deeper
examination. In this review, I will examine the possibility that singularities
remain in quantum gravity, the roles they may play, and the possible links
between singularity and black hole thermodynamics. I will also discuss how --
inspired by Penrose's Weyl curvature hypothesis -- gravitational entropy for a
black hole can be defined using curvature invariants, and the surprising
implication that the entropy of black holes in different theories of gravity
are different manifestations of spacetime curvature, i.e., their underlying
microstructures could be different. Finally, I review the ""Hookean law""
recently established for singly rotating Myers-Perry black holes (including
Kerr black holes) that connect black hole fragmentation -- a consequence of the
second law of black hole thermodynamics -- with the maximum ""Hookean force"", as
well as with the thermodynamic geometry of Ruppeiner. This also suggests a new
way to study black hole microstructures, and hints at the possibility that some
black holes are beyond the Hookean regime (and thus have different
microstructures). While examining the remarkable connections between black hole
thermodynamics, spacetime singularities and cosmic censorship, as well as
gravitational entropy, I shall point out some subtleties, provide some new
thoughts, and raise some hard but fundamental questions, including whether
black hole thermodynamics is really just ""ordinary thermodynamics"" or something

celestial CFT. In two dimensions, the Mellin transform is simply the Fourier
transform in rapidity space, and the ""celestial correlator"" has no position
dependence. The simplified setting allows us to study the analytic properties
of CCFT correlators exactly as a function of the conformal dimensions. We find
that the correlators exist as real distributions of the conformal weights, with
asymptotics controlled by the mass spectrum and three-point couplings of the
model. Coupling these models to a flat space limit of JT gravity preserves
integrability and dresses the amplitudes by a rapidly varying gravitational
phase. We find that the coupling to gravity smooths out certain singular
aspects of the Mellin-transformed correlators.

investigated from the perspectives of semi-classical vacua, twisted chiral

technology ushers in its revolution and also brings numerous challenges,
particularly in the field of cryptocurrency. Recently, a large number of
criminal behaviors continuously emerge on blockchain, such as Ponzi schemes and
phishing scams, which severely endanger decentralized finance. Existing
graph-based abnormal behavior detection methods on blockchain usually focus on
constructing homogeneous transaction graphs without distinguishing the
heterogeneity of nodes and edges, resulting in partial loss of transaction
pattern information. Although existing heterogeneous modeling methods can
depict richer information through metapaths, the extracted metapaths generally
neglect temporal dependencies between entities and do not reflect real
behavior. In this paper, we introduce Time-aware Metapath Feature Augmentation
(TMFAug) as a plug-and-play module to capture the real metapath-based
transaction patterns during Ponzi scheme detection on Ethereum. The proposed
module can be adaptively combined with existing graph-based Ponzi detection
methods. Extensive experimental results show that our TMFAug can help existing
Ponzi detection methods achieve significant performance improvements on the
Ethereum dataset, indicating the effectiveness of heterogeneous temporal
information for Ponzi scheme detection.

(JMAK) theory of first-order phase transformation kinetics and phase-field (PF)
results of a benchmark problem on nucleation. To address the stochasticity of
the problem, several hundreds of simulations are performed to establish a
comprehensive, statistically-significant analysis of the coincidences and
discrepancies between PF and JMAK transformation kinetics. We find that PF
predictions are in excellent agreement with both classical nucleation theory
and JMAK theory, as long as the original assumptions of the latter are
appropriately reproduced - in particular, the constant nucleation and growth
rates in an infinite domain. When deviating from these assumptions, PF results
are at odds with JMAK theory. In particular, we observe that the size of the
initial particle radius $r_0$ relative to the critical nucleation radius $r^*$
has a significant effect on the rate of transformation. While PF and JMAK agree
when $r_0$ is sufficiently higher than $r^*$, the duration of initial transient
growth stage of a particle, before it reaches a steady growth velocity,
increases as $r_0/r^*\to 1$. This incubation time has a significant effect on
the overall kinetics, e.g. on the Avrami exponent of the multi-particle
simulations. In contrast, for the considered conditions and parameters, the
effect of interface curvature upon transformation kinetics - in particular
negative curvature regions appearing during particle impingement, present in PF
but absent in JMAK theory - appears to be minor compared to that of $r_0/r^*$.
We argue that rigorous benchmarking of phase-field models of stochastic
processes (e.g. nucleation) need sufficient statistical data in order to make
rigorous comparisons against ground truth theories. In these problems, analysis
of probability distributions is clearly preferable to a deterministic approach.

to materials science. This technology allows for the elucidation of
3-dimensional internal structure by the attenuation of x-rays through an object
at different rotations relative to the beam. By imaging 2-dimensional
projections, a 3-dimensional object can be reconstructed through a
computational algorithm. Imaging at a greater number of rotation angles allows
for improved reconstruction. However, taking more measurements increases the
x-ray dose and may cause sample damage. Deep neural networks have been used to
transform sparse 2-D projection measurements to a 3-D reconstruction by
training on a dataset of known similar objects. However, obtaining high-quality
object reconstructions for the training dataset requires high x-ray dose
measurements that can destroy or alter the specimen before imaging is complete.
This becomes a chicken-and-egg problem: high-quality reconstructions cannot be
generated without deep learning, and the deep neural network cannot be learned
without the reconstructions. This work develops and validates a self-supervised
probabilistic deep learning technique, the physics-informed variational
autoencoder, to solve this problem. A dataset consisting solely of sparse
projection measurements from each object is used to jointly reconstruct all
objects of the set. This approach has the potential to allow visualization of
fragile samples with x-ray computed tomography. We release our code for

demonstrate that incorporating of bi-direction MIP images enables MEDS-Net to

But, this also leads to Ethereum network being susceptible to a wide variety of
threats and attacks in an attempt to gain unreasonable advantage or to
undermine the value of the users. Even with the state-of-art classical ML
algorithms, detecting such attacks is still hard. This motivated us to build a
hybrid system of quantum-classical algorithms that improves phishing detection
in financial transaction networks. This paper presents a classical ensemble
pipeline of classical and quantum algorithms and a detailed study benchmarking
existing Quantum Machine Learning algorithms such as Quantum Support Vector
Machine and Variational Quantum Classifier. With the current generation of
quantum hardware available, smaller datasets are more suited to the QML models
and most research restricts to hundreds of samples. However, we experimented on
different data sizes and report results with a test data of 12K transaction
nodes, which is to the best of the authors knowledge the largest QML experiment
run so far on any real quantum hardware. The classical ensembles of
quantum-classical models improved the macro F-score and phishing F-score. One
key observation is QSVM constantly gives lower false positives, thereby higher
precision compared with any other classical or quantum network, which is always
preferred for any anomaly detection problem. This is true for QSVMs when used
individually or via bagging of same models or in combination with other
classical/quantum models making it the most advantageous quantum algorithm so
far. The proposed ensemble framework is generic and can be applied for any
classification task

we examine a combination of recent contrastive learning methodologies like
Momentum Contrast (MoCo) and Cross-Level Instance-Group Discrimination (CLD) to

show that a combination of MoCo, CLD, and geometric augmentations outperforms
conventional models pretrained on ImageNet by a large margin. Meanwhile,
strategies for smoothing label or prediction distribution in supervised

combine the self-supervised contrastive models with image mixup strategies and
find that it is useful for learning more robust visual representations.
Crucially, our methods still yield favorable results even if we reduce the

double the recall of the baseline at similar precision. This effectively allows
reducing the number of required annotations to a fraction while still being

functional brain connectivity (chronnectome), as opposed to static connectivity
(connectome). The experimental results demonstrate that IMAGIN achieves a
5-fold cross-validation accuracy of 79.25%, which surpasses the current
state-of-the-art by 1.5%. In addition, analysis of the spatial and temporal
attention scores provides further validation for the neural basis of autism.

"2211.09704","Kyeong Min Kim","Kyeong Min Kim","Regions exhibiting stationary values of average cross section",,,,,"math.GM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The problem of maximizing the average cross section through a point within a
shape is introduced. This idea is extended into arbitrary dimensions. However,
the average cross sectional volume cannot be maximized unless the cross
sections pass through the centroid of the shape. Therefore, we focus on the
shapes with stationary values of average cross section. A novel formula for
average cross section in any dimension is presented. The equation of the
stationary shape is derived and the general characteristics are discussed
through algebraic solution, numerical analysis, and interpretation with
graphical display. The special properties of the stationary shapes in 2, 3, and
5 dimension is examined.

"2212.03297","Justin Xie","Justin Xie","Fine-Grained Emotional Paraphrasing along Emotion Gradients",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Paraphrase generation, a.k.a. paraphrasing, is a common and important task in
natural language processing. Emotional paraphrasing, which changes the emotion
embodied in a piece of text while preserving its meaning, has many potential
applications, e.g., moderating online dialogues and preventing cyberbullying.
We introduce a new task of fine-grained emotional paraphrasing along emotion
gradients, that is, altering the emotional intensities of the paraphrases in
fine grain following smooth variations in affective dimensions while preserving
the meanings of the originals. We propose a framework for addressing this task
by fine-tuning text-to-text Transformers through multi-task training. We
enhance several widely used paraphrasing corpus by annotating the input and
target texts with their fine-grained emotion labels. With these labels,
fine-tuning text-to-text Transformers on these corpus entails multi-task
training. Evaluations of the fine-tuned Transformers on separate test sets show
that including fine-grained emotion labels in the paraphrase task significantly
improve the chance of obtaining high-quality paraphrases of the desired
emotions, i.e., more than doubling the number of exact matches of desired
emotions while achieving consistently better scores in paraphrase metrics such
as BLEU, ROGUE, and METEOR.

working or failed. It is fundamental to all types of current networks, such as
utility networks (gas, water, electricity, and 4G/5G), the Internet of Things
(IoT), social networks, and supply chains. Network reliability is an important
index in the planning, design, evaluation, and control of network systems, and
the minimal path (MC) is the basis of an MC-based algorithm for calculating
reliability. A new BAT called recursive node-based BAT is proposed and
implemented in a recursive manner such that the jth vector in the ith iteration
is equal to its parent, which is the jth vector, except that its ith coordinate
value is one. Based on time complexity analysis and experiments on 20 benchmark
binary-state networks, the proposed recursive node-based BAT is more efficient
than the best-known node-based algorithm in finding MCs when combined with
powerful rules to discard these infeasible vectors and all their offspring.
