  KTaO$_3$",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.supr-con","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Motivated by the recent experimental discovery of strongly
surface-plane-dependent superconductivity at surfaces of KTaO$_3$ single
crystals, we calculate the electron-phonon coupling strength, $\lambda$, of
doped KTaO$_3$ along the reciprocal-space high-symmetry directions. Using the
Wannier-function approach implemented in the EPW package, we calculate
$\lambda$ across the experimentally covered doping range and compare its
mode-resolved distribution along the [001], [110] and [111] reciprocal-space
directions. We find that the electron-phonon coupling is strongest in the
optical modes around the $\Gamma$ point, with some distribution to higher $k$
values in the [001] direction. The electron-phonon coupling strength as a
function of doping has a dome-like shape in all three directions and its
integrated total is largest in the [001] direction and smallest in the [111]
direction, in contrast to the experimentally measured trends in critical
temperatures. This disagreement points to a non-BCS character of the
superconductivity. Instead, the strong localization of $\lambda$ in the soft
optical modes around $\Gamma$ suggests an importance of ferroelectric soft-mode
fluctuations, which is supported by our findings that the mode-resolved
$\lambda$ values are strongly enhanced in polar structures. The inclusion of
spin-orbit coupling has negligible influence on our calculated mode-resolved
$\lambda$ values.

connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). In this paper, we develop an adaptive
sampling framework to efficiently evaluate the accident rate of CAVs,
particularly for scenario-based tests where the probability distribution of
input parameters is known from the Naturalistic Driving Data. Our framework
relies on a surrogate model to approximate the CAV performance and a novel
acquisition function to maximize the benefit (information to accident rate) of
the next sample formulated through an information-theoretic consideration. In
addition to the standard application with only a single high-fidelity model of
CAV performance, we also extend our approach to the bi-fidelity context where
an additional low-fidelity model can be used at a lower computational cost to
approximate the CAV performance. Accordingly, for the second case, our approach
is formulated such that it allows the choice of the next sample in terms of
both fidelity level (i.e., which model to use) and sampling location to
maximize the benefit per cost. Our framework is tested in a widely-considered
two-dimensional cut-in problem for CAVs, where Intelligent Driving Model (IDM)
with different time resolutions are used to construct the high and low-fidelity
models. We show that our single-fidelity method outperforms the existing
approach for the same problem, and the bi-fidelity method can further save half
of the computational cost to reach a similar accuracy in estimating the
accident rate.

investigated numerically. The introduction of a slight transverse shear reduces
the flow rate $Q$ by up to 70% compared to stationary bottom, but the flow rate
shows a modest increase by further increasing the external shear. Focusing on
the dependency of flow rate $Q$ on orifice diameter $D$, the spheres and rods
show two distinct trends. For rods, in the small aperture limit $Q$ seems to
follow an exponential trend, deviating from the classical power-law dependence.
These macroscopic observations are in good agreement with our earlier
experimental findings [Phys. Rev. E $\textbf{103}$, 062905 (2021)]. With the
help of the coarse-graining methodology we obtain the spatial distribution of
the macroscopic density, velocity, kinetic pressure, and orientation fields.
This allows us detecting a transition from funnel to mass flow pattern, caused
by the external shear. Additionally, averaging these fields in the region of
the orifice reveals that the strong initial decrease in $Q$ is mostly
attributed to changes in the flow velocity, while the weakly increasing trend
at higher rotation rates is related to increasing packing fraction. Similar
analysis of the grain orientation at the orifice suggests a correlation of the
flow rate magnitude with the vertical orientation and the packing fraction at
the orifice with the order of the grains. Lastly, the vertical profile of mean
acceleration at the center of the silo denotes that the region where the
acceleration is not negligible shrinks significantly due to the strong
perturbation induced by the moving wall.

larger than $10^{54} ~{\rm ergs}$. Its fairly low redshift makes it a promising
candidate for high energy neutrino detection. However, a neutrino search for
this GRB reported by the IceCube collaboration yielded a null result. In this
paper, we utilize the upper limit from IceCube observation to test different
GRB prompt emission models. We find that, at least for this specific burst, the
dissipative photosphere model could be ruled out in a large parameter space.
The internal shock model can survive only with a large bulk motion Lorentz
factor $\Gamma$, where the most stringent and conservative constraints are
$\Gamma > \sim 450$ and $\Gamma > \sim 200$, respectively. Also, the ratio of
the total dissipated energy that goes into the protons and electrons
($\epsilon_p / \epsilon_e$) can be constrained with a given $\Gamma$. For
$\Gamma < 400$, $\epsilon_p / \epsilon_e < 10$ is required. For the

the constraint from GRB 221009A is modest. Under ICMART model, only for extreme
situations when most dissipated energy deposit into protons and all accelerated
protons are suitable for producing neutrinos, a slightly large bulk motion

find a good agreement between our $ab$ $initio$ models and the experimental

resolves MACS0647$-$JD as having two components that are either merging
galaxies or stellar complexes within a single galaxy. Both are very small, with
stellar masses $\sim10^8\,M_\odot$ and radii $r<100\,\rm pc$. The brighter
larger component ""A"" is intrinsically very blue ($\beta\sim-2.6$), likely due
to very recent star formation and no dust, and is spatially extended with an
effective radius $\sim70\,\rm pc$. The smaller component ""B"" appears redder
($\beta\sim-2$), likely because it is older ($100-200\,\rm Myr$) with mild dust
extinction ($A_V\sim0.1\,\rm mag$), and a smaller radius $\sim20\,\rm pc$. We
identify galaxies with similar colors in a high-redshift simulation, finding
their star formation histories to be out of phase. With an estimated stellar
mass ratio of roughly 2:1 and physical projected separation $\sim400\,\rm pc$,
we may be witnessing a galaxy merger 400 million years after the Big Bang. We
also identify a candidate companion galaxy C $\sim3\,{\rm kpc}$ away, likely
destined to merge with galaxies A and B. The combined light from galaxies A+B
is magnified by factors of $\sim$8, 5, and 2 in three lensed images JD1, 2, and
3 with F356W fluxes $\sim322$, $203$, $86\,\rm nJy$ (AB mag 25.1, 25.6, 26.6).
MACS0647$-$JD is significantly brighter than other galaxies recently discovered
at similar redshifts with JWST. Without magnification, it would have AB mag
27.3 ($M_{UV}=-20.4$). With a high confidence level, we obtain a photometric
redshift of $z=10.6\pm0.3$ based on photometry measured in 6 NIRCam filters
spanning $1-5\rm\mu m$, out to $4300\,\r{A}$ rest-frame. JWST NIRSpec

solution and is used to define the pH with wide-ranging applications in
biological and materials sciences. Measuring pH with graphene field-effect
transistors (FETs) has been described in the past but has yet to be
characterized with a monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) capping layer. hBN
capping is hypothesized to lower the chemical affinity of protons to oxidized
defects in the graphene crystal and lower the standard deviation of pH
measurement via screening charge density. First, the electronic properties of
commercial, monolayer graphene and monolayer hBN/graphene, both on four-inch 90
nm SiO2/p-type Si, were contrasted as a function of solutal pH in 10 mM
phosphate buffered solution. The two-dimensional (2D) FETs were fabricated with
photoresistless metallization followed by microcentrifuge tube-masking and
reactive ion etching to define a quasi-pure 2D sensing mesa for pH sensing.
Thereafter, the devices were exposed to phosphate buffer of varying pH and the
resistance and liquid-transfer characteristics measured. The hBN/graphene/SiO2
FETs had higher linearity, and both lower standard deviation and range of Dirac
voltage shifting than monolayer graphene/SiO2. Then, before microcentrifuge
tube-masking, freshly metallized devices were coated with 9 nm of Al2O3 by
electron beam deposition. The Al2O3/graphene/SiO2 and Al2O3/hBN/graphene/SiO2
devices showed an altered response to the pH of the phosphate buffered
solutions before and after basic etching of the Al2O3 with NaOH (pH = 12). This
prompted studying the pH-dependencies of the 2D devices as a function of the
thickness of Al2O3 via atomic layer deposition. These results show that
modifying the surface of monolayer graphene with nanoscale dielectrics enables
tuning of the pH-dependent electronic properties of graphene pH sensors.

to vary on different timescales. Studying this variability is vital to
understanding a star's evolution and provides insight into the complex
processes at work within. Understanding the dichotomy between continuum veiling
and emission line veiling is integral to accurately measuring the amount of
veiling present in stellar spectra. Here, 15 roughly consecutive nights of
optical spectroscopic data from the spectropolarimeter ESPaDOnS are utilised to
characterise the short-term accretion activity in the CTTS, RU Lup, and
investigate its relationship with the veiling in the LiI 6707A absorption line.
The accretion-tracing HI Balmer series emission lines were studied and used to
obtain the accretion luminosity (Lacc) and mass accretion rate (Macc) for each
night, which vary by a factor of ~2 between the brightest and dimmest nights.
We also measured the veiling using multiple photospheric absorption lines (NaI
5688A, MnI 6021A, and LiI 6707A) for each night. We find the LiI 6707A line
provides measurements of veiling that produce a strong, positive correlation
with Lacc in the star. When corrected for Li depletion, the average veiling
measured in the LiI 6707A line is r_LiI(avg)~3.25+/-0.20, which is consistent
with the other photospheric lines studied (r_avg~3.28+/-0.65). We measured
short timescale variability in the Lacc and Macc that are intrinsic and not due
to geometric effects. Upon comparing the changes in veiling and Lacc, we find a
strong, positive correlation. This study provides an example of how this
correlation can be used as a tool to determine whether a measured variability
is due to extinction or an intrinsic change in accretion. As the determination
of veiling is an independent process from measuring Lacc, their relationship
allows further exploration of accretion phenomena in young stars.

interest in applications where sparse solutions are desired, and to assess the
quality of solutions returned by approximate algorithms and heuristics. The
task is known to be NP-hard for growing dimension and, even in low dimensions,
extremely challenging in practice due to an exponential scaling of the linear
programming formulations associated with the search for sparse solutions.
  A common approach to facilitate practical computations is an approximation
based on the choice of a small, fixed set $S_0$ of support points, or a fixed
set $S^*_0$ of combinations of support points from the measures, that may be
assigned mass. Through a combination of linear and integer programming
techniques, we model an integer program to compute additional combinations, and
in turn support points, that, when added to $S^*_0$ or $S_0$, allow for a
better approximation of the underlying exact barycenter problem. The approach
improves on the scalability of a classical column generation approach: instead
of a pricing problem that has to evaluate exponentially many reduced cost
values, we solve a mixed-integer program of quadratic size. The properties of
the model, and practical computations, reveal a tailored branch-and-bound
routine as a good solution strategy.

properties, including chemical heterogeneity, strain disorder, phase impurity,
etc. It has been found that grain and grain boundary (GB) are tightly related
to lots of microscale and nanoscale behavior in MHP thin film. Atomic force
microscopy (AFM) is widely used to observe grain and boundary structures in
topography and subsequently to study the correlative surface potential and
conductivity of these structures. For now, most AFM measurements have been
performed in imaging mode to study the static behavior, in contrast, AFM
spectroscopy mode allows us to investigate the dynamic behavior of materials,
e.g. conductivity under sweeping voltage. However, a major limitation of AFM
spectroscopy measurements is that it requests manual operation by human
operators, as such only limited data can be obtained, hindering systematic
investigations of these microstructures. In this work, we designed a workflow
combining the conductive AFM measurement with a machine learning (ML) algorithm
to systematically investigate grain boundaries in MHPs. The trained ML model
can extract GBs locations from the topography image, and the workflow drives
the AFM probe to each GB location to perform a current-voltage (IV) curve
automatically. Then, we are able to IV curves at all GB locations, allowing us
to systematically understand the property of GBs. Using this method, we
discover that the GB junction points are more photoactive, while most previous
works only focused on the difference between GB and grains.

importance to many natural language processing (NLP) applications. Previous
solutions for this task often produce text that contains degenerative
expressions or lacks semantic consistency. Recently, Su et al. introduced a new
decoding method, contrastive search, based on the isotropic representation
space of the language model and obtained new state of the art on various
benchmarks. Additionally, Su et al. argued that the representations of
autoregressive LMs (e.g. GPT-2) are intrinsically anisotropic which is also
shared by previous studies. Therefore, to ensure the language model follows an
isotropic distribution, Su et al. proposed a contrastive learning scheme,
SimCTG, which calibrates the language model's representations through
additional training.
  In this study, we first answer the question: ""Are autoregressive LMs really
anisotropic?"". To this end, we extensively evaluate the isotropy of LMs across
16 major languages. Surprisingly, we find that the anisotropic problem only
exists in the two specific English GPT-2-small/medium models. On the other
hand, all other evaluated LMs are naturally isotropic which is in contrast to
the conclusion drawn by previous studies. Based on our findings, we further
assess the contrastive search decoding method using off-the-shelf LMs on four
generation tasks across 16 languages. Our experimental results demonstrate that
contrastive search significantly outperforms previous decoding methods without
any additional training. More notably, on 12 out of the 16 evaluated languages,
contrastive search performs comparably with human-level performances as judged
by human evaluations. Our code and other related resources are publicly

the practical difficulty in building a monolithic architecture for quantum
systems, such as computers, based on optimal QLDPC codes, it is worth
considering a distributed implementation of such codes over a network of
interconnected medium-sized quantum processors. In such a setting, all syndrome
measurements and logical operations must be performed through the use of
high-fidelity shared entangled states between the processing nodes. Since
probabilistic many-to-1 distillation schemes for purifying entanglement are
inefficient, we investigate quantum error correction based entanglement
purification in this work. Specifically, we employ QLDPC codes to distill GHZ
states, as the resulting high-fidelity logical GHZ states can interact directly
with the code used to perform distributed quantum computing (DQC), e.g. for
fault-tolerant Steane syndrome extraction. This protocol is applicable beyond
the application of DQC since entanglement distribution and purification is a
quintessential task of any quantum network. We use the min-sum algorithm (MSA)
based iterative decoder with a sequential schedule for distilling 3-qubit GHZ
states using a rate 0.118 family of lifted product QLDPC codes and obtain a
threshold of 10.7% under depolarizing noise. Our results apply to larger size

Early Universe, can increase the effective number of relativistic species
($N_{\rm eff}$) by a further correction that depends on the integrated
energy-density in gravitational waves over all scales. This effect is typically
used to constrain (blue-tilted) models of inflation in light of the bounds
resulting from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. In this paper, we recompute this
contribution, discussing some caveats of the state-of-the-art analyses. Through
a parametric investigation, we first demonstrate that the calculation is
dominated by the ultraviolet frequencies of the integral and therefore by the
behavior of the tensor spectrum on scales corresponding to modes that cross the
horizon very close to the end of inflation, when the slow-roll dynamics breaks
down and the production of gravitational waves becomes strongly model
dependent. Motivated by these results, we realize a theoretical Monte Carlo
and, working within the framework of the Effective Field Theory of inflation,
we investigate the observable predictions of a very broad class of models. For
each model, we solve a system of coupled differential equations whose solution
completely specifies the evolution of the spectrum up to the end of inflation.
We prove the calculation of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}^{\rm GW}$ to be remarkably
model-dependent and therefore conclude that accurate analyses are needed to
infer reliable information on the inflationary Universe.

i.e., the recovery of quaternion signal from the magnitude of quaternion linear

reconstructed up to a global right quaternion phase factor from $O(d)$
phaseless measurements. We also develop the scalable algorithm quaternion
Wirtinger flow (QWF) for solving QPR, and establish its linear convergence
guarantee. Compared with the analysis of complex Wirtinger flow, a series of
different treatments are employed to overcome the difficulties of the
non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication. Moreover, we develop a variant
of QWF that can effectively utilize a pure quaternion priori (e.g., for color
images) by incorporating a quaternion phase factor estimate into QWF
iterations. The estimate can be computed efficiently as it amounts to finding a
singular vector of a $4\times 4$ real matrix. Motivated by the variants of
Wirtinger flow in prior work, we further propose quaternion truncated Wirtinger
flow (QTWF), quaternion truncated amplitude flow (QTAF) and their pure
quaternion versions. Experimental results on synthetic data and color images
are presented to validate our theoretical results. In particular, for pure
quaternion signal recovery, our quaternion method often succeeds with

$n_s-r$ plane which is well constrained by the Planck experiment. We
investigate two separate cases, (i) inflaton decays to radiation dominantly and
(ii) inflaton decays to RHN dominantly which subsequently decays to the SM
particles to reheat the Universe adequately. We obtain the corresponding
estimates for $n_s$ and $r$ and find the latter case to be more predictive in
view of recent Planck/BICEP data. We furnish the results considering $\alpha-$
attractor inflationary models, however the prescription proposed here is quite
generic and can be implemented to various kinds of single field inflationary
models given the conditions for non-thermal leptogeneis is satisfied.

craft fix templates or directly predict potential patches. Large Pre-Trained
Language Models (PLMs), trained using billions of text/code tokens, can
potentially help avoid this issue. Very recently, researchers have directly
leveraged PLMs for APR without relying on any bug-fixing datasets. Meanwhile,
such existing work either failed to include state-of-the-art PLMs or was not
evaluated on realistic datasets.
  In this work, we perform the first extensive study on directly applying PLMs
for APR. We select 9 recent state-of-the-art PLMs, including both generative
and infilling models, ranging from 125M to 20B in size. We designed 3 different
repair settings to evaluate the different ways we can use PLMs to generate
patches. We apply the PLMs under these repair settings on 5 datasets across 3
different languages and compare different PLMs in the number of bugs fixed,
generation speed and compilation rate. Our study demonstrates that directly
applying state-of-the-art PLMs can already substantially outperform all
existing APR techniques on all our datasets. Among the studied PLMs, the
scaling effect exists for APR where larger models tend to achieve better
performance. Also, we show for the first time that suffix code after the buggy
line (adopted in infilling-style APR) is important in not only generating more
fixes but more patches with higher compilation rate. Besides patch generation,
the PLMs consider correct patches to be more natural than other ones, and can
even be leveraged for effective patch ranking or patch correctness checking.

infinite size due to the large variety of possible combinations of building
blocks and topology. Discovering the optimal MOFs for specific applications
requires an efficient and accurate search over an enormous number of potential
candidates. Previous high-throughput screening methods using computational
simulations like DFT can be time-consuming. Such methods also require
optimizing 3D atomic structure of MOFs, which adds one extra step when
evaluating hypothetical MOFs. In this work, we propose a structure-agnostic
deep learning method based on the Transformer model, named as MOFormer, for
property predictions of MOFs. The MOFormer takes a text string representation
of MOF (MOFid) as input, thus circumventing the need of obtaining the 3D
structure of hypothetical MOF and accelerating the screening process.
Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework that pretrains
the MOFormer via maximizing the cross-correlation between its
structure-agnostic representations and structure-based representations of
crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) on >400k publicly available
MOF data. Using self-supervised learning allows the MOFormer to intrinsically
learn 3D structural information though it is not included in the input.
Experiments show that pretraining improved the prediction accuracy of both
models on various downstream prediction tasks. Furthermore, we revealed that
MOFormer can be more data-efficient on quantum-chemical property prediction
than structure-based CGCNN when training data is limited. Overall, MOFormer
provides a novel perspective on efficient MOF design using deep learning.

landscape of quantum phases emerges from electron correlations. The method of
extended dynamical mean field theory (EDMFT) has been developed for clean
lattice models of the correlated electrons. For such models, not only onsite
Hubbard-like interactions are important, but so are intersite interactions.
Importantly, the EDMFT method treats the interplay between the onsite and
intersite interactions dynamically. It was initially formulated for models of
the two-band Anderson-lattice type with intersite interactions, as well as for
the one-band Hubbard type with intersite Heisenberg-like terms that are often
called Hubbard-Heisenberg models. In the case of Kondo lattice models, the
EDMFT method incorporates a dynamical competition between the local Kondo and
intersite Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions. In these models,
the EDMFT-based analyses led to the notion of Kondo destruction, which has
played a central role in the understanding of quantum critical heavy fermion
metals. In this article, we summarize the EDMFT method, and survey its
applications, particularly for Kondo/Anderson lattice models. We also discuss
the prospect for further developing the EDMFT method, as well as for applying
it to address the correlation physics in a variety of new settings. Among the
latter are the orbital-selective Mott physics that arises both in iron-based
superconductors and in frustrated bulk systems with topological flat bands.

  Language Models",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Language modeling on large-scale datasets leads to impressive performance
gains on various downstream language tasks. The validation pre-training loss
(or perplexity in autoregressive language modeling) is often used as the
evaluation metric when developing language models since the pre-training loss
tends to be well-correlated with downstream performance (which is itself
difficult to evaluate comprehensively). Contrary to this conventional wisdom,
this paper shows that 1) pre-training loss cannot fully explain downstream
performance and 2) flatness of the model is well-correlated with downstream
performance where pre-training loss is not. On simplified datasets, we identify
three ways to produce models with the same (statistically optimal) pre-training
loss but different downstream performance: continue pre-training after
convergence, increasing the model size, and changing the training algorithm.
These experiments demonstrate the existence of implicit bias of pre-training
algorithms/optimizers -- among models with the same minimal pre-training loss,
they implicitly prefer more transferable ones. Toward understanding this
implicit bias, we prove that SGD with standard mini-batch noise implicitly
prefers flatter minima in language models, and empirically observe a strong
correlation between flatness and downstream performance among models with the
same minimal pre-training loss. We also prove in a synthetic language setting
that among the models with the minimal pre-training loss, the flattest model
transfers to downstream tasks.

wave (CDW) material is widely believed to be a massless phason -- a collective
modulation of the phase of the CDW order parameter. However, as first pointed
out by Lee and Fukuyama, long-range Coulomb interactions should push the phason
energy up to the plasma energy of the CDW condensate, resulting in a massive
phason and a fully gapped spectrum. Whether such behavior occurs in a CDW
system has been unresolved for more than four decades. Using time-domain THz
emission spectroscopy, we investigate this issue in the material
(TaSe$_4$)$_2$I, a classical example of a quasi-one-dimensional CDW insulator.
Upon transient photoexcitation at low temperatures, we find the material
strikingly emits coherent, narrow-band THz radiation. The frequency,
polarization and temperature-dependence of the emitted radiation imply the
existence of a phason that acquires mass by coupling to long-range Coulomb
interaction. Our observations constitute the first direct evidence of the
massive ""Lee-Fukuyama"" phason and highlight the potential applicability of

perform stress tests to assess DLMD performance in small & large networks.

with a rate-determining barrier of 0.81-1.24 eV. Moreover, MoSi2N4 is an
extremely-air-stable material, which will facilitate its application in various

Focusing on the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model, we demonstrate that there

rate of decay towards the steady state. Further, varying $\xi_{\rm prop}$ can
lead to anomalously large relaxation times that scale with system size, or to

explicitly decomposes aleatoric variance into mechanistic components,
quantifying the contribution to uncertainty produced by each factor in the
epidemic process, and how these contributions vary over time. The aleatoric

affects future variance. We find that, superspreading is not necessary for
substantial uncertainty, and profound variation in outbreak size can occur even
without overdispersion in the offspring distribution (i.e. the distribution of
the number of secondary infections an infected person produces). Aleatoric
forecasting uncertainty grows dynamically and rapidly, and so forecasting using
only epistemic uncertainty is a significant underestimate. Therefore, failure
to account for aleatoric uncertainty will ensure that policymakers are misled
about the substantially higher true extent of potential risk. We demonstrate
our method, and the extent to which potential risk is underestimated, using two

star formation rate, and the gas circular velocity. We use a suite of FIRE-2
galaxy simulations with a variety of cosmic-ray transport physics to
demonstrate that our analytic model of $\kappa_{\rm min}^{\rm eff}$ is a robust
lower limit of the true cosmic-ray transport rate. We then apply our new model
to calculate $\kappa_{\rm min}^{\rm eff}$ for galaxies in the COS-Halos sample,
and confirm this already reveals strong evidence for an effective transport
rate which rises rapidly away from the interstellar medium to values
$\kappa_{\rm min}^{\rm eff}\gtrsim 10^{30-31}\,{\rm cm}^2\,{\rm s}^{-1}$

larger than $50-100$\,kpc. We discuss how future observations can provide
qualitatively new constraints in our understanding of cosmic rays in the CGM

has been key for testing cosmological models on various scales. Below $M_\star
\sim 10^9\,M_\odot$, such studies have primarily relied on the satellite galaxy
population orbiting the Milky Way. Here we present new constraints on the
connection between satellite galaxies and their host dark matter subhalos using
the largest sample of satellite galaxies in the Local Volume ($D \lesssim
12\,\mathrm{Mpc}$) to date. We use $250$ confirmed and $71$ candidate dwarf
satellites around 27 Milky Way (MW)-like hosts from the Exploration of Local
VolumE Satellites (ELVES) Survey and use the semi-analytical SatGen model for
predicting the population of dark matter subhalos expected in the same volume.
Through a Bayesian model comparison of the observed and the forward-modeled
satellite stellar mass functions (SSMF), we infer the satellite stellar-to-halo
mass relation. We find that the observed SSMF is best reproduced when subhalos
are populated by a relation of the form $M_\star \propto
M^\alpha_\mathrm{peak}$, with a moderate slope of $\alpha=2.0 \pm 0.1$, and a
scatter that grows with decreasing $M_\mathrm{peak}$. We find a significantly
larger scatter towards lower peak halo masses, compared to prior studies that
relied mainly on MW satellites. We conclude that this scatter results from a
combination of star formation stochasticity and host-to-host scatter. Our new
model for the satellite-subhalo connection has important implications for both
of these baryonic-impacted effects, as well as on dark matter physics.

However, unresolved temperature fluctuations within individual HII regions and
across different HII regions throughout a galaxy can bias metallicity estimates
low, with a magnitude that depends on the underlying and typically unknown
temperature distribution. Using a toy model, we confirm that computing
$T_e$-based metallicities using the temperature derived from the [O III]
$\lambda$4363/$\lambda$5007 or [O II] $\lambda\lambda$7320,7330 / [O II]
$\lambda\lambda$3727 ratio ('ratio temperature'; $T_{\rm ratio}$) results in an
underprediction of metallicity when temperature fluctuations are present. In
contrast, using the unobservable 'line temperatures' ($T_{\rm line}$) that
provide the mean electron and ion density-weighted emissivity yield an accurate
metallicity estimate. To correct this bias in low-mass galaxies, we demonstrate
an example calibration of a relation between T_ratio and T_line based on a
high-resolution (4.5 pc) RAMSES-RTZ simulation of a dwarf galaxy that
self-consistently models the formation of multiple HII regions and ion
temperature distribution in a galactic context. Applying this correction to the
low-mass end of the mass-metallicity relation shifts its normalization up by
0.18 dex on average and flattens its slope from 0.87 to 0.58, highlighting the
need for future studies to account for, and correct, this bias.

galaxies strongly affects the abundance measurements: both [Mg/H] and [Fe/H]
are anti-correlated with $R_e$, while the relative abundance [Mg/Fe] slightly
increases with $R_e$. The $\alpha$ enhancement as tracked by [Mg/Fe] traces the
formation timescale of a galaxy weakly, and mostly depends on $R_e$. Aperture
effects are important: measuring the stellar abundances within 1~kpc instead of
within $R_e$ can make a large difference. These results are all due to a nearly
universal, steeply declining stellar abundance profile that does not scale with
galaxy size -- small galaxies appear metal-rich because their stars live in the
inner part of the profile where abundances are high. The slope of this profile
is mostly set by the gas-phase abundance profile and not substantially modified
by stellar age gradients. The gas-phase abundance profile, in turn, is
determined by the strong radial dependence of the gas fraction and star
formation efficiency. We develop a simple model to describe the chemical
enrichment, in which each radial bin of a galaxy is treated as an independent
closed-box system. This model reproduces the gas-phase abundance profile of
simulated galaxies, but not the detailed distribution of their stellar
abundances, for which gas and/or metal transport are likely needed.

structure of their scalar field space beyond the large volume/large complex
structure regime. We focus on regimes where the F-theory field space
effectively reduces to the deformation space of the worldsheet theory of a
critical string obtained from a wrapped D3-brane. In case that this critical
string is a heterotic string with a simple GLSM description, we identify new
strong coupling singularities in the interior of the F-theory field space.
Whereas from the perturbative perspective these singularities manifest
themselves through a breakdown of the perturbative $\alpha'$-expansion, the
dual GLSM perspective reveals that at the non-perturbative level these
singularities correspond to loci in field space along which the worldsheet
theory of the critical D3-brane string breaks down and a 7-brane gauge theory
becomes strongly coupled due to quantum effects. Therefore these singularities
signal a transition to a strong coupling phase in the F-theory field space
which can be shown to arise due to the failure of the F-theory field space to
factorize between complex structure and Kahler sector at the quantum level.
Such singularities are hence a feature of a genuine N=1 theory without a direct
counterpart in N=2 theories in 4d. By relating our setup to recent studies of
global string solutions associated to axionic strings we argue that the
D3-brane string dual to the perturbative heterotic string leaves the spectrum
of BPS strings when traversing into the strong coupling phase. The absence of
the perturbative, critical heterotic string then provides a physical
explanation for the breakdown of the perturbative expansion and the obstruction
of certain classical infinite distance limits in accordance with the Emergent
String Conjecture.

manifests in the ability to decode the system's initial quantum information

formation and evolution is not fully understood. Here, we investigate the
effect of thick discs in bar formation and evolution by means of a suite of
N-body models of (kinematically cold) thin-(kinematically hot) thick discs. We
systematically vary the mass fraction of the thick disc, the thin-to-thick disc
scale length ratio as well as thick disc's scale height to examine the bar
formation under diverse dynamical scenarios. Bars form almost always in our
models, even in presence of a massive thick disc. The part of the bar
constituted by the thick disc closely follows the overall growth and temporal
evolution of the part of the bar constituted by the thin disc, only the part of
the bar in the thick disc is weaker than the part of the bar in the thin disc.
The formation of stronger bars is associated with a simultaneous larger loss of
angular momentum and a larger radial heating. In addition, we demonstrate a
preferential loss of angular momentum and a preferential radial heating of disc
stars, along the azimuthal direction within the extent of the bar, in both thin
and thick disc stars. For purely thick disc models (without any thin disc), the
bar formation critically depends on the disc scale length and scale height. A
larger scale length and/or a larger vertical scale height delays the bar
formation time and/or suppresses the bar formation almost completely in
thick-disc-only models. We find that the Ostriker-Peeble criterion predicts the
bar instability scenarios in our models better than the
Efstathiou-Lake-Negroponte criterion.

into the growth of massive cosmic structures. Groups are particularly
interesting in this context, because they represent the link between galactic
haloes and massive clusters. However, low surface brightness makes their
diffuse light extremely challenging to detect individually. Stacking many
groups is a promising alternative, but its physical interpretation is
complicated by possible systematic variations of diffuse light profiles with
other group properties. Another issue is the often ambiguous choice of group
centre. We explore these challenges using mock observations for 497 galaxy
groups and clusters with halo masses from $~ 10^{12} \textrm{M}_{\odot}$ to
$1.5 \times 10^{15}\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ at redshift $0.1$ from the Hydrangea

five galaxies above $10^{9} \textrm{M}_{\odot}$ in stellar mass, the $r$-band
brightest galaxy is not the one at the centre of the gravitational potential;
line-of-sight projections account for half of these cases. Miscentring does not
significantly affect the ensemble average mass density profile or the surface
brightness profile for our sample: even within ambiguously centred haloes,
different centring choices lead to only a 1 per cent change in the total
fraction of diffuse intra-group light, $f_{\textrm{IGL}}$. We find strong
correlations of $f_{\textrm{IGL}}$ with the luminosity of the central group
galaxy and halo mass. Stacking groups in narrow bins of central galaxy
luminosity will therefore make the physical interpretation of the signal more
straightforward than combining systems across a wide range of mass.

by the small number of qualified literary translators relative to the many
untranslated works published around the world. Machine translation (MT) holds
potential to complement the work of human translators by improving both
training procedures and their overall efficiency. Literary translation is less
constrained than more traditional MT settings since translators must balance
meaning equivalence, readability, and critical interpretability in the target
language. This property, along with the complex discourse-level context present
in literary texts, also makes literary MT more challenging to computationally
model and evaluate. To explore this task, we collect a dataset (Par3) of
non-English language novels in the public domain, each aligned at the paragraph
level to both human and automatic English translations. Using Par3, we discover
that expert literary translators prefer reference human translations over
machine-translated paragraphs at a rate of 84%, while state-of-the-art
automatic MT metrics do not correlate with those preferences. The experts note
that MT outputs contain not only mistranslations, but also discourse-disrupting
errors and stylistic inconsistencies. To address these problems, we train a
post-editing model whose output is preferred over normal MT output at a rate of
69% by experts. We publicly release Par3 at

allows to map these materials onto a single band Hubbard model, in which the
dimers reside on an anisotropic triangular lattice. By changing the inorganic
unit $X$ or applying physical pressure, the correlation strength and anisotropy
of the triangular lattice can be varied. This has lead to the discovery of a
variety of exotic phenomena, including quantum spin liquid states, a plethora
of long-range magnetic orders in proximity to a Mott metal-insulator

can be described within this effective one-band Hubbard model on a triangular
lattice, it became evident in recent years that this simplified description is
insufficient to capture all observed magnetic and electronic properties. The
ingredients for generalized models that are relevant include, but are not

engineering and geophysics. DAS's ability to simultaneously collect high
spatial resolution data over long arrays suggests that it is especially well
suited for near-surface imaging applications such as 2D MASW (multi-channel
analysis of surface waves). 2D MASW aims to produce a pseudo-2D cross-section
of shear-wave velocity (Vs) for the purpose of identifying and characterizing
subsurface layering and anomalies. These cross-sections are produced by
interpolating numerous 1D Vs profiles extracted from overlapping sub-arrays
along the testing alignment. When using traditional seismic equipment, these
sub-arrays are typically collected in a roll-along configuration, where the
equipment is moved along the alignment at some predetermined sub-array
interval. DAS does not have the same limitations, as data from all shot
locations are simultaneously recorded along the entire length of the DAS array.
This alleviates the requirements to pre-determine sub-array length and interval
during the acquisition stage and allows for multiple geometries to be
investigated during the processing stage. The present study utilizes DAS data
to evaluate the effects of sub-array length on 2D MASW results at a
well-characterized field test site. We organize the DAS waveforms into multiple
sets of overlapping MASW sub-arrays of differing lengths, allowing for direct
comparison of the derived results at the same site. We show that the length of
the individual MASW sub-arrays has a significant effect on the resolution of
the resulting cross-sections as well as the resolved location of large
impedance contrasts at our study site and evaluate those locations compared to
invasive testing.

their growth history and physical properties. One particularly interesting
region is the splashback radius, $R_{\rm sp}$, which marks the transition
between particles orbiting in the halo and particles undergoing first infall.
While the dependence of $R_{\rm sp}$ on the recent accretion rate is well
established and theoretically expected, it is not clear exactly what parts of
the accretion history $R_{\rm sp}$ responds to, and what other halo properties
might additionally influence its position. We comprehensively investigate these
questions by correlating the dynamically measured splashback radii of a large
set of simulated haloes with their individual growth histories as well as their
structural, dynamical, and environmental properties. We find that $R_{\rm sp}$
is sensitive to the accretion over one crossing time but largely insensitive to
the prior history (in contrast to concentration, which probes earlier epochs).
All secondary correlations are much weaker, but we discern a relatively higher
$R_{\rm sp}$ in less massive, older, more elliptical, and more tidally deformed
haloes. Despite these minor influences, we conclude that the splashback radius
is a clean indicator of a halo's growth over the past dynamical time. We
predict that the magnitude gap should be a promising observable indicator of a
halo's accretion rate and splashback radius.

Concretely, given a directed positive graph $\mathcal{G}^d$ specified by
random-walk graph Laplacian matrix $\mathbf{L}_{rw}$, we first define
reconstruction of a smooth signal $\mathbf{x}^*$ from samples $\mathbf{y}$
using graph shift variation (GSV) $\|\mathbf{L}_{rw} \mathbf{x}\|^2_2$ as a

training and testing data, resulting in poor performance in novel domains.
Domain generalization (DG) aims to overcome the problem by leveraging multiple
source domains to learn a domain-generalizable model. In this paper, we propose
a novel augmentation-based DG approach, dubbed AugLearn. Different from
existing data augmentation methods, our AugLearn views a data augmentation
module as hyper-parameters of a classification model and optimizes the module
together with the model via meta-learning. Specifically, at each training step,
AugLearn (i) divides source domains into a pseudo source and a pseudo target
set, and (ii) trains the augmentation module in such a way that the augmented
(synthetic) images can make the model generalize well on the pseudo target set.
Moreover, to overcome the expensive second-order gradient computation during
meta-learning, we formulate an efficient joint training algorithm, for both the
augmentation module and the classification model, based on the implicit
function theorem. With the flexibility of augmenting data in both time and
frequency spaces, AugLearn shows effectiveness on three standard DG benchmarks,
PACS, Office-Home and Digits-DG.

its transverse conductivity in the presence of an electric field and other

reconstruct large-scale ionization fields (bubble spatial distributions)

diverse new examples of large-scale ionization maps from a single realization

becomes increasingly complex, especially in many cases, such as legal or
medical affairs, measuring similarity requires extra care and precision, as
small acts within a language unit can have significant real-world effects. My
research goal in this thesis is to develop regression models that account for
similarities between language units in a more refined way.
  Computation of similarity has come a long way, but approaches to debugging
the measures are often based on continually fitting human judgment values. To
this end, my goal is to develop an algorithm that precisely catches loopholes
in a similarity calculation. Furthermore, most methods have vague definitions
of the similarities they compute and are often difficult to interpret. The
proposed framework addresses both shortcomings. It constantly improves the
model through catching different loopholes. In addition, every refinement of
the model provides a reasonable explanation. The regression model introduced in

combines attack testing with adversarial training. The similarity regression

against the best non-stationary policy is \textsf{NP}-hard when both rewards

algorithms which {\it generate} an equilibrium when they are used by all

large number of inserted or removed edges come in, we have to handle these
edges on time to keep up with the data stream. There are two main sequential

  To the best of our knowledge, all existing parallel approaches are based on

topological Hall effect namely, the chiral domains, with domain-wall chirality
quantified by an integer skyrmion number. These spin structures are different
from the skyrmions formed due to Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interactions in B20
crystals and multilayered thin films, and caused by cooperative magnetization
reversal in the exchange-coupled cobalt nanoparticles. An analytical model is
developed to explain the underlying physics of Berry-phase hysteresis, which is
strikingly different from the iconic magnetic hysteresis and constitutes one
aspect of 21st-century reshaping of our view on nature at the borderline of
physics, chemistry, mathematics, and materials science.

between the largest marginal observations. The H\""usler-Reiss distribution is a
versatile model for this extremal dependence, and it is usually parameterized
by a variogram matrix. In order to represent conditional independence relations
and obtain sparse parameterizations, we introduce the novel H\""usler-Reiss
precision matrix. Similarly to the Gaussian case, this matrix appears naturally
in density representations of the H\""usler-Reiss Pareto distribution and
encodes the extremal graphical structure through its zero pattern. For a given,
arbitrary graph we prove the existence and uniqueness of the completion of a
partially specified H\""usler-Reiss variogram matrix so that its precision
matrix has zeros on non-edges in the graph. Using suitable estimators for the
parameters on the edges, our theory provides the first consistent estimator of
graph structured H\""usler-Reiss distributions. If the graph is unknown, our
method can be combined with recent structure learning algorithms to jointly
infer the graph and the corresponding parameter matrix. Based on our

Astrobiology Program, and it underpins the science of missions that explore the
environments of Solar System planets and exoplanets. However, the detection of
extraterrestrial life, in our Solar System and beyond, is sufficiently
challenging that it is likely that multiple measurements and approaches,
spanning disciplines and missions, will be needed to make a convincing claim.
Life detection will therefore not be an instantaneous process, and it is
unlikely to be unambiguous-yet it is a high-stakes scientific achievement that
will garner an enormous amount of public interest. Current and upcoming
research efforts and missions aimed at detecting past and extant life could be
supported by a consensus framework to plan for, assess and discuss life
detection claims (c.f. Green et al., 2021). Such a framework could help
increase the robustness of biosignature detection and interpretation, and
improve communication with the scientific community and the public. In response
to this need, and the call to the community to develop a confidence scale for
standards of evidence for biosignature detection (Green et al., 2021), a
community-organized workshop was held on July 19-22, 2021. The meeting was
designed in a fully virtual (flipped) format. Preparatory materials including
readings, instructional videos and activities were made available prior to the
workshop, allowing the workshop schedule to be fully dedicated to active
community discussion and prompted writing sessions. To maximize global
interaction, the discussion components of the workshop were held during
business hours in three different time zones, Asia/Pacific, European and US,

summarizes data using a convex polytope. In its original formulation, for fixed
k, the method finds a convex polytope with k vertices, called archetype points,
such that the polytope is contained in the convex hull of the data and the mean
squared Euclidean distance between the data and the polytope is minimal.
  In the present work, we consider an alternative formulation of archetypal
analysis based on the Wasserstein metric, which we call Wasserstein archetypal
analysis (WAA). In one dimension, there exists a unique solution of WAA and, in
two dimensions, we prove existence of a solution, as long as the data
distribution is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. We
discuss obstacles to extending our result to higher dimensions and general data
distributions. We then introduce an appropriate regularization of the problem,
via a Renyi entropy, which allows us to obtain existence of solutions of the
regularized problem for general data distributions, in arbitrary dimensions. We
prove a consistency result for the regularized problem, ensuring that if the
data are iid samples from a probability measure, then as the number of samples
is increased, a subsequence of the archetype points converges to the archetype
points for the limiting data distribution, almost surely. Finally, we develop
and implement a gradient-based computational approach for the two-dimensional
problem, based on the semi-discrete formulation of the Wasserstein metric. Our
analysis is supported by detailed computational experiments.

towards unseen topics occurring in the same document corpus. Such task
formulation has three limitations: (i) Single domain/dataset. A system is
optimized on a particular dataset from a single domain; therefore, the
resulting system cannot work well on other datasets; (ii) the model is
evaluated on a limited number of unseen topics; (iii) it is assumed that part
of the topics has rich annotations, which might be impossible in real-world
applications. These drawbacks will lead to an impractical stance detection
system that fails to generalize to open domains and open-form topics. This work
defines OpenStance: open-domain zero-shot stance detection, aiming to handle
stance detection in an open world with neither domain constraints nor
topic-specific annotations. The key challenge of OpenStance lies in the
open-domain generalization: learning a system with fully unspecific supervision
but capable of generalizing to any dataset. To solve OpenStance, we propose to
combine indirect supervision, from textual entailment datasets, and weak
supervision, from data generated automatically by pre-trained Language Models.
Our single system, without any topic-specific supervision, outperforms the
supervised method on three popular datasets. To our knowledge, this is the
first work that studies stance detection under the open-domain zero-shot

  Network (CDN)","Accepted by KDD 2023 Applied Data Science (ADS) track",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Industry recommender systems usually suffer from highly-skewed long-tail item
distributions where a small fraction of the items receives most of the user
feedback. This skew hurts recommender quality especially for the item slices
without much user feedback. While there have been many research advances made
in academia, deploying these methods in production is very difficult and very
few improvements have been made in industry. One challenge is that these
methods often hurt overall performance; additionally, they could be complex and
expensive to train and serve. In this work, we aim to improve tail item
recommendations while maintaining the overall performance with less training
and serving cost. We first find that the predictions of user preferences are
biased under long-tail distributions. The bias comes from the differences
between training and serving data in two perspectives: 1) the item
distributions, and 2) user's preference given an item. Most existing methods
mainly attempt to reduce the bias from the item distribution perspective,
ignoring the discrepancy from user preference given an item. This leads to a
severe forgetting issue and results in sub-optimal performance.
  To address the problem, we design a novel Cross Decoupling Network (CDN) (i)
decouples the learning process of memorization and generalization on the item
side through a mixture-of-expert architecture; (ii) decouples the user samples
from different distributions through a regularized bilateral branch network.
Finally, a new adapter is introduced to aggregate the decoupled vectors, and
softly shift the training attention to tail items. Extensive experimental
results show that CDN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate its effectiveness by a case study of
CDN in a large-scale recommendation system at Google.

method based on a dimension iteration/reduction procedure, it does not need to
store the integration points, neither does it compute the function values
independently at each integration point, instead, it re-uses the computation
for function evaluations as much as possible by performing the function
evaluations at all integration points in a cluster and iteratively along
coordinate directions. It is shown numerically that the computational
complexity (in terms of CPU time) of the proposed MDI-SG method is of
polynomial order $O(Nd^3 )$ or better, compared to the exponential order
$O(N(\log N)^{d-1})$ for the standard sparse grid method, where $N$ denotes the
maximum number of integration points in each coordinate direction. As a result,
the proposed MDI-SG method effectively circumvents the curse of dimensionality
suffered by the standard sparse grid method for high-dimensional numerical

world's highest-intensity muon beam, a detector system capable of efficiently

successful implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT) on vision tasks. With
vision Transformers, specifically the multi-head self-attention modules,
networks can capture long-term dependencies inherently. However, these
attention modules normally need to be trained on large datasets, and vision
Transformers show inferior performance on small datasets when training from
scratch compared with widely dominant backbones like ResNets. Note that the
Transformer model was first proposed for natural language processing, which
carries denser information than natural images. To boost the performance of
vision Transformers on small datasets, this paper proposes to explicitly
increase the input information density in the frequency domain. Specifically,
we introduce selecting channels by calculating the channel-wise heatmaps in the
frequency domain using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), reducing the size of
input while keeping most information and hence increasing the information
density. As a result, 25% fewer channels are kept while better performance is
achieved compared with previous work. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach on five small-scale datasets, including
CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, Flowers-102, and Tiny ImageNet. The accuracy has been
boosted up to 17.05% with Swin and Focal Transformers. Codes are available at

Given the difficulty of physically mapping mammalian gene circuitry, we require
new computational methods to learn regulatory rules. Natural language is a
valuable analogy to the communication of regulatory control. Machine learning
systems model natural language by explicitly learning context dependencies
between words. We propose a similar system applied to single-cell RNA
expression profiles to learn context dependencies between genes. Our model,
Exceiver, is trained across a diversity of cell types using a self-supervised
task formulated for discrete count data, accounting for feature sparsity. We
found agreement between the similarity profiles of latent sample
representations and learned gene embeddings with respect to biological
annotations. We evaluated Exceiver on a new dataset and a downstream prediction
task and found that pretraining supports transfer learning. Our work provides a
framework to model gene regulation on a single-cell level and transfer
knowledge to downstream tasks.

proving reversible photon-to-phonon conversion. We show that these oscillations
are a signature of the optomechanical strong coupling signalizing the emergence
of elusive phonon-exciton-photon quasiparticles -- the phonoritons. We then
demonstrate full control of the phonoriton spectrum as well as coherent
microwave-to-photon interconversion using electrically generated GHz-vibrations

  Having in mind the role of comma objects in the enriched context, we consider
some of the characteristic properties of protomodularity with respect to comma

protomodularity and certain properties on pullbacks also holds when replacing
conveniently pullbacks by comma objects in any finitely complete category

categories. We conclude by studying this sort of lax protomodularity for OrdAb,
equipped with a suitable Ord-enrichment, and show that OrdAb fulfills the
equivalent lax protomodular properties with respect to the weaker notion of
precomma object; we call such categories lax preprotomodular.

samples given at arbitrarily scattered sites. This problem is essential in
numerical sciences, where modern applications also highlight the need for a
solution to the case of functions with manifold values. In this paper, we
introduce and analyze a combination of kernel-based quasi-interpolation and
multiscale approximations for both scalar- and manifold-valued functions. While
quasi-interpolation provides a powerful tool for approximation problems if the
data is defined on infinite grids, the situation is more complicated when it
comes to scattered data. Here, higher-order quasi-interpolation schemes either
require derivative information or become numerically unstable. Hence, this
paper principally studies the improvement achieved by combining
quasi-interpolation with a multiscale technique. The main contributions of this
paper are as follows. First, we introduce the multiscale quasi-interpolation
technique for scalar-valued functions. Second, we show how this technique can
be carried over using moving least-squares operators to the manifold-valued
setting. Third, we give a mathematical proof that converging
quasi-interpolation will also lead to converging multiscale
quasi-interpolation. Fourth, we provide ample numerical evidence that
multiscale quasi-interpolation has superior convergence to quasi-interpolation.
In addition, we will provide examples showing that the multiscale
quasi-interpolation approach offers a powerful tool for many data analysis
tasks, such as denoising and anomaly detection. It is especially attractive for
cases of massive data points and high dimensionality.

algorithms when run on a quantum machine perfectly isolated from its
environment. However, the advantage is substantially diminished as the NISQ-era
quantum machines lack the large number of qubits necessary to provide error
correction. Noise in the computation grows with the number of gate counts in
the circuit with each iteration of amplitude amplification. After a certain
number of amplifications, the loss in accuracy from the gate noise starts to
overshadow the gain in accuracy due to amplification, forming an inflection
point. Beyond this point, accuracy continues to deteriorate until the machine
reaches a maximally mixed state where the result is uniformly random. Hence,
quantum transpilers should take the noise parameters of the underlying quantum
machine into consideration such that the circuit can be optimized to attain the
maximal accuracy possible for that machine. In this work, we propose an
extension to the transpiler that predicts the accuracy of the result at every
amplification with high fidelity by applying pure Bayesian analysis to
individual gate noise rates. Using this information, it finds the inflection
point and optimizes the circuit by halting amplification at that point. The
prediction is made without needing to execute the circuit either on a quantum

to identify nova grains, also depends on $^{22}$Na produced. Uncertainties on
its yield in classical novae currently originate from the rate of the
$^{22}$Na(p, $\gamma$)$^{23}$Mg reaction. At peak novae temperatures, this
reaction is dominated by a resonance at E$_{\text{R}}$=0.204 MeV, corresponding
to the $E_x$=7.785 MeV excited state in $^{23}$Mg. The resonance strengths
measured so far disagree by one order of magnitude. An experiment has been
performed at GANIL to measure the lifetime and the proton branching ratio of
this key state, with a femtosecond resolution for the former. The reactions
populating states in $^{23}$Mg have been studied with a high resolution
detection set-up, i.e. the particle VAMOS, SPIDER and gamma tracking AGATA

present here a comparison between experimental results and shell-model

Rather small values obtained for reduced $M1$ matrix elements, $|M(M1)|\lesssim

decrease for nuclides when $N \neq Z$. While we provide evidence this arises
from the physical nuclear force by contrasting with random two-body

Nonetheless, the low entanglement suggests that in models of neutron-rich

that such a model is effectively ruled out by low-$\ell$ CMB data, in
particular by the reduced peak-smearing due to CMB lensing and the excess
Integrated Sachs--Wolfe (ISW) signal caused by the additional dark energy
density required to preserve flatness after dark matter conversion into dark

without further modifications. This conclusion extends and generalizes related
conclusions derived for the standard decaying dark matter model.

convex risk functional that incorporates a sefety margin with respect to

models. The particular form of the parametrization allows us to develop a
numerical method, based on neural networks, which gives both the value of the
risk functional and the optimal perturbation of the reference measure.
Moreover, we study the problem under additional constraints on the
perturbations, namely, a mean and a martingale constraint. We show that, in
both cases, under suitable conditions on the loss function, it is still
possible to estimate the risk functional by passing to a parametric family of
perturbed models, which again allows for a numerical approximation via neural

polarization to a heteronucleus (usually 13C) in the molecule. Adiabatic

transfer, but this is necessarily a slow process, which is undesirable since
the spins continually relax back to thermal equilibrium. Here we demonstrate

fundamental physics of dislocations has remained a grand challenge in
computational materials science for decades. To overcome this challenge, method
of Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DDD) has been developed, with the premise
that crystal plasticity should naturally emerge in its realistic complexity by
letting a statistically representative ensemble of dislocations evolve in
response to deformation. However, DDD does not resolve atomistic details of
dislocation motion leaving open the possibility that certain physical
mechanisms key to crystal plasticity may be overlooked. To date, large-scale
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are emerging as an alternative approach for
predicting crystal plasticity, with the advantage that mechanisms not
previously anticipated can be uncovered. Here we show how cross-comparison
between DDD and MD simulations performed under identical conditions exposes
glaring discrepancies in the predicted strength and microstructure evolution.
The discrepancies are traced to previously unknown behaviors of dislocation
network nodes. While it has been widely assumed that, as a consequence of glide
constraints on connecting segments such nodes would strongly restrict
dislocation motion, our MD simulations reveal that dislocation nodes enjoy much
greater freedom of motion than previously anticipated and without ever
violating the glide constraints. Only after the fundamental kinematic rules in
the mesoscopic DDD model are modified to properly account for the newly
discovered freedoms of nodal motion, DDD simulations begin to closely reproduce
crystal plasticity response and microstructure evolution observed in MD
simulations.

on supervised learning, reducing their applicability in real-world

Island, as well as the Malay Peninsula and Java, in creating terrain-induced
circulations over the Indian Ocean (IO) that subsequently develop into tropical
cyclones (TCs). Applying sophisticated vortex tracking software to 2.5 yrs of
model analyses, F16 found four regions downstream of topographic features in
the Maritime Continent to be prolific generators of low-level cyclonic vortices
(123/yr). This present study extends the limited analyses of F16 by applying a
similar approach to 10 yrs (2008-2017) of ERA5 analyses. While the 2.5-yr
period which F16 studied was slightly (8%) more active in terms of vortex
production than the 10-yr period, in general the findings of F16 are
representative of the longer-term record with 80% of all shed vortices
occurring with easterly low-level (925 hPa) flow over the hotspot regions.
Additional analysis of the 10-yr record found that vortex counts are highest
near MJO phase 1 when low-level easterlies are strongest over the maritime
continent region. A secondary peak in vortex counts occurs during MJO phase 4
when low-level westerlies were present near the equator west of Sumatra. This
suggests that low-level westerly surges on the equator impinging on Sumatra
associated with the MJO contribute to an increase in wake vortex development.
While the frequency of vortex genesis over the four hotspot regions is strongly
tied to the annual cycle of winds, periods with anomalous zonal flow are shown
to impact vortex counts. This is most apparent in the region off the southern
tip of Sumatra where vortex counts were 4 times higher during periods of
anomalous easterlies compared to periods with anomalous westerlies. In this
region positive (negative) ENSO and Indian-Ocean Dipole conditions drive
anomalous easterlies (westerlies) which impact vortex formation rates.

the Chow group of zero-cycles, $\text{CH}_0(A)$, with successive quotients
related to a Somekawa $K$-group. In this article we show that this filtration
behaves well with respect to isogeny, and in particular if $n:A\to A$ is the
multiplication by $n$ map on $A$, then its push-forward $n_\star$ is given on
the quotient $F^r/F^{r+1}$ by multiplication by $n^r$. In the special case when
$A=E_1\times\cdots\times E_d$ is a product of elliptic curves, we show that
this filtration agrees with a filtration defined by Raskind and Spiess and with
the Pontryagin filtration previously considered by Beauville and Bloch. We also
obtain some results in the more general case when $A$ is isogenous to a product
of elliptic curves. When $k$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$, using
Jacobians of curves isogenous to products of elliptic curves, we give new
evidence for a conjecture of Raskind and Spiess and Colliot-Th\'{e}l\`{e}ne,
which predicts that the kernel of the Albanese map is the direct sum of a

Autonomous Vehicle (SAV) service as a feasible solution to serve the mobility
needs of a small city where fixed route, circulator type public transportation
may be too expensive to operate. The presented work builds upon our earlier
work that modeled the city of Marysville, Ohio as an example of such a city,
with realistic traffic behavior, and trip requests. A simple SAV dispatcher is
implemented to model the behavior of the proposed on-demand mobility service.
The goal of the service is to optimally distribute SAVs along the network to
allocate passengers and shared rides. The pickup and drop-off locations are
strategically placed along the network to provide mobility from affordable
housing, which are also transit deserts, to locations corresponding to jobs and
other opportunities. The study is carried out by varying the behaviors of the
SAV driving system from cautious to aggressive along with the size of the SAV
fleet and analyzing their corresponding performance. It is found that the size
of the network and behavior of AV driving system behavior results in an optimal
number of SAVs after which increasing the number of SAVs does not improve
overall mobility. For the Marysville network, which is a 9 mile by 8 mile
network, this happens at the mark of a fleet of 8 deployed SAVs. The results
show that the introduction of the proposed SAV service with a simple optimal
shared scheme can provide access to services and jobs to hundreds of people in
a small sized city.

the deformation modes of a thin elastic ribbon as a function of applied
end-to-end twist and tension. Our simulations reproduce all reported
experimentally observed modes, including transitions from helicoids to
longitudinal wrinkles, creased helicoids and loops with self-contact, and
transverse wrinkles to accordion self-folds. Our simulations also show that the
twist angles at which the primary longitudinal and transverse wrinkles appear
are well described by various analyses of the F\""oppl-von K\'arm\'an (FvK)
equations, but the characteristic wavelength of the longitudinal wrinkles has a
more complex relationship to applied tension than previously estimated. The
clamped edges are shown to suppress longitudinal wrinkling over a distance set
by the applied tension and the ribbon width, but otherwise have no apparent
effect on measured wavelength. Further, by analyzing the stress profile, we
find that longitudinal wrinkling does not completely alleviate compression, but
caps the magnitude of the compression. Nonetheless, the width over which
wrinkles form is observed to be wider than the near-threshold analysis
predictions -- the width is more consistent with the predictions of
far-from-threshold analysis. However, the end-to-end contraction of the ribbon
as a function of twist is found to more closely follow the corresponding
near-threshold prediction as tension in the ribbon is increased, in contrast to
the expectations of far-from-threshold analysis. These results point to the
need for further theoretical analysis of this rich thin elastic system, guided
by our physically robust and intuitive simulation model.

skew the results by submitting malformed data. In this paper, we formally study
the impact of poisoning attacks for graph degree estimation protocols under

protocol more vulnerable to poisoning -- the impact of poisoning is worse when
the adversary can directly poison their (noisy) responses, rather than their
input data. Second, we observe that graph data is naturally redundant -- every
edge is shared between two users. Leveraging this data redundancy, we design
robust degree estimation protocols under LDP that can significantly reduce the

evaluate our proposed robust degree estimation protocols under poisoning

decay, forming the `second' unbound ejecta component which manifests itself as
the inner dense component seen in the late phase.

recently due to their learning abilities in handling data uncertainties in
distributed scenarios. However, it is challenging for DFNNs to handle cases in
which the local data are non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID).
In this paper, we propose a federated fuzzy neural network (FedFNN) with
evolutionary rule learning (ERL) to cope with non-IID issues as well as data
uncertainties. The FedFNN maintains a global set of rules in a server and a
personalized subset of these rules for each local client. ERL is inspired by
the theory of biological evolution; it encourages rule variations while
activating superior rules and deactivating inferior rules for local clients
with non-IID data. Specifically, ERL consists of two stages in an iterative
procedure: a rule cooperation stage that updates global rules by aggregating
local rules based on their activation statuses and a rule evolution stage that
evolves the global rules and updates the activation statuses of the local
rules. This procedure improves both the generalization and personalization of
the FedFNN for dealing with non-IID issues and data uncertainties. Extensive
experiments conducted on a range of datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
FedFNN over state-of-the-art methods.

f(\mathbb E_{z'\sim S_2} \ell(w; z, z'))$, where two sets of data $S_1, S_2$
are distributed over multiple machines, $\ell(\cdot)$ is a pairwise loss that
only depends on the prediction outputs of the input data pairs $(z, z')$, and
$f(\cdot)$ is possibly a non-linear non-convex function. This problem has
important applications in machine learning, e.g., AUROC maximization with a
pairwise loss, and partial AUROC maximization with a compositional loss. The
challenges for designing an FL algorithm for X-risks lie in the
non-decomposability of the objective over multiple machines and the
interdependency between different machines. To this end, we propose an
active-passive decomposition framework that decouples the gradient's components
with two types, namely active parts and passive parts, where the active parts
depend on local data that are computed with the local model and the passive
parts depend on other machines that are communicated/computed based on
historical models and samples. Under this framework, we develop two provable FL
algorithms (FeDXL) for handling linear and nonlinear $f$, respectively, based
on federated averaging and merging. We develop a novel theoretical analysis to
combat the latency of the passive parts and the interdependency between the
local model parameters and the involved data for computing local gradient
estimators. We establish both iteration and communication complexities and show
that using the historical samples and models for computing the passive parts do
not degrade the complexities. We conduct empirical studies of FeDXL for deep

ability to switch from their hydrophobic form to a hydrophilic form when put in
contact with an acidic trigger such as $CO_2$. As a consequence, SHSs qualify
as promising alternatives to volatile organic compounds during the industrial
solvent extraction processes, as greener and inexpensive methods can be applied
to separate and recover SHSs. Furthermore, because of their less volatile
nature, SHSs are less flammable and so increase the safety of a larger-scale
extraction process. In this work, we study the dynamics and in-drop phase
separation during the dissolution process of a drop composed of SHS and
polymer, triggered by an acid in the surrounding aqueous environment. From 70
different experimental conditions, we found a scaling relationship between the
drop dissolution time and initial volume with an overall scaling coefficient
$\sim$ 0.53. We quantitatively assessed and found a shorter dissolution time
related with a decrease in pH of the aqueous phase or an increase in initial
polymer concentration in the drop. Examining the internal state of the drop
during the dissolution revealed an in-drop phase separation behavior, resulting
in a porous morphology of the final polymer particle. Our experimental results
provide a microscopic view of the SHS dissolution process from droplets, and
findings may help design SHS extraction processes for particle formation from

interstellar flight is studied analytically and numerically. A sinusoidal
perturbation is introduced into a two-dimensional thin-film sail to determine
if the sail remains stable or if the perturbations grow in amplitude. A
reflective material that gives specular reflection of the laser illumination is
assumed in determining the resulting loading on the sail, although other
reflection models can be incorporated as well. The quasi-static solution of the
critical point between shape stability and instability is found by equating the
bending moments induced on the sail due to radiation pressure with the
restoring moments caused by the strength of the sail and the tension applied at
the edges of the sail, permitting analytical expressions for the elastic
modulus and boundary tension magnitude to be found as a function of sail
properties and the amplitude and wave number of the initial perturbation. These
expressions are also derived from a formal variational energy approach. A
numerical model of the sail dynamics is developed by discretizing the sail into
finite elements. By introducing torsional and rectilinear springs between the
elements into the numerical model, a hierarchy of models is produced that can
incorporate the effects of bending and applied tension. The numerical models
permit the transient dynamics of a perturbed sail to be compared to the
analytic results of the quasi-static analysis. The analytic expressions can
correctly predict the stability boundary found in the numerical simulations.
The stiffness required to make a sail stable against uncontrolled perturbation
growth is shown to be unfeasible for known materials. A modest tensioning of
the sail (e.g., via an inflatable structure or spinning of the sail) can
maintain a stable sail shape under all wavelengths and amplitudes of
perturbations.

approximation. The other method is to construct an auxiliary model with
Gaussian radial basis functions (GRBFs) to approximate the solution such that
we may take advantage of the fact that the fractional Laplacian of a Gaussian
is known analytically. Based on these two different ways for the approximation
of the fractional Laplacian, we propose two models, MCNF and GRBFNF, to
approximate stationary FPEs and MCTNF to approximate time-dependent FPEs. To
further improve the accuracy, we refine the training set and the approximate
solution alternately. A variety of numerical examples is presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptive deep density approaches.

models, model mismatch between exact and nominal models often affects their
stealthiness, or even makes the stealthiness lost. To solve this problem, our
current paper presents a novel stealthy measurement-aided pole-dynamics attacks
(MAPDAs) method with model mismatch. Firstly, the limitations of TPDAs using
exact models are revealed, where exact models help ensure the stealthiness of
TPDAs but model mismatch severely influences its stealthiness. Secondly, to
handle model mismatch, the proposed MAPDAs method is designed by using a model
reference adaptive control strategy, which can keep the stealthiness. Moreover,
it is easier to implement as only the measurements are needed in comparison
with the existing methods requiring both the measurements and control inputs.
Thirdly, the performance of the proposed MAPDAs method is explored using
convergence of multivariate measurements, and MAPDAs with model mismatch have
the same stealthiness and similar destructiveness as TPDAs. Specifically,
MAPDAs with adaptive gains will remain stealthy at an acceptable detection
threshold till destructiveness occurs. Finally, experimental results from a
networked inverted pendulum system confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of
the proposed method.

the locations to be sampled are chosen based on information about the phenomena
under study. In this case, point pattern models are commonly used as the
probability law for the distribution of the locations. However, analytic
intractability of the point process likelihood prevents its direct calculation.
Many Bayesian (and non-Bayesian) approaches in non-parametric model
specifications handle this difficulty with approximation-based methods. These
approximations involve errors that are difficult to quantify and can lead to
biased inference. This paper presents an approach for performing exact Bayesian
inference for this setting without the need for model approximation. A
qualitatively minor change on the traditional model is proposed to circumvent
the likelihood intractability. This change enables the use of an augmented
model strategy. Recent work on Bayesian inference for point pattern models can
be adapted to the geostatistics setting and renders computational tractability
for exact inference for the proposed methodology. Estimation of model
parameters and prediction of the response at unsampled locations can then be
obtained from the joint posterior distribution of the augmented model.
Simulated studies showed good quality of the proposed model for estimation and
prediction in a variety of preferentiality scenarios. The performance of our
approach is illustrated in the analysis of real datasets and compares

masses of single, free-floating brown dwarfs, independent of evolutionary and
atmospheric models. The proper motions and parallaxes of nearby brown dwarfs
can be used to predict close future alignments with distant background stars
that cause a microlensing event. Targeted astrometric follow up of the
predicted microlensing events permits the brown dwarf's mass to be measured.
Predicted microlensing events are typically found via searching for a peak
threshold signal using an estimate of the lens mass. We develop a novel method
that finds predicted events that instead will lead to a target lens mass
precision. The main advantage of our method is that it does not require a lens
mass estimate. We use this method to search for predicted astrometric
microlensing events occurring between 2014 - 2032 using a catalog of 1225 low
mass star and brown dwarf lenses in the Solar Neighborhood of spectral type M6
or later and a background source catalog from DECaLS Data Release 9. The
background source catalog extends to $g = $ 23.95, providing a more dense
catalog compared to Gaia. Our search did not reveal any upcoming microlensing
events. We estimate the rate of astrometric microlensing event for brown dwarfs
in the Legacy Survey and find it to be low $\sim10^{-5}$yr$^{-1}$. We recommend
carrying out targeted searches for brown dwarfs in front of the Galactic Bulge
and Plane to find astrometric microlensing events that will allow the masses of
single, free-floating brown dwarfs to be measured.

has garnered significant attention from the computer science and optimization
communities since the mid-80s, the advantages they offer over their

for their success are largely based on heuristics. Filling this long-standing
gap between theory and practice, we show that oblique regression trees
(constructed by recursively minimizing squared error) satisfy a type of oracle
inequality and can adapt to a rich library of regression models consisting of
linear combinations of ridge functions and their limit points. This provides a
quantitative baseline to compare and contrast decision trees with other less

need not always trade-off interpretability with accuracy. Specifically, we show
that, under suitable conditions, oblique decision trees achieve similar

obtained by continuation as stationary periodic solutions in the co-moving
reference frame starting from small-amplitude neutrally stable waves. We find a
variety of solitary waves that appear when a periodic solution approaches a
homoclinic loop. Wave interactions are studied using direct numerical
simulations of the boundary-layer model. We reveal that in the early stages of
temporal evolution coarsening is dominated by an inelastic collision and
merging of waves that travel at different speeds. Eventually, coarsening
becomes arrested when the waves have reached the largest admissible amplitude.
Bifurcation analysis confirms the existence of an upper bound of possible
solitary wave amplitudes, thus explaining the arrest of coarsening. In the
mixed regime, when both mode types are unstable, the temporal dynamics becomes
highly irregular due to the competition between a faster-travelling zig-zag
mode and a slower-travelling varicose mode. A quintessentially two-layer
dynamical regime is found, which corresponds to a ruptured second layer. In

  Set-Based Design",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The design of complex systems is typically uncertain and ambiguous at early
stages. Set-Based Design is a promising approach to complex systems design as
it supports alternative exploration and gradual uncertainty reduction. When
designing a complex system, functional requirements decomposition is a common
and effective approach to progress the design incrementally. However, the
current literature on Set-Based Design lacks formal guidance in functional
requirements decomposition. To bridge the gap, we propose a formal process to
hierarchically decompose the functional requirements for Set-Based Design. A
four-step formal process is proposed to systematically define, reason, and
narrow the sets, and eventually decompose the functional requirement into the
sub-requirements. Such a process can be used by the individual suppliers
working in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction and guarantee that the
resulting system will eventually satisfy the top-level functional requirements.
An example of designing a cruise control system is applied to demonstrate the
feasibility of the proposed process.

context sensitive. We propose a compositional and strictly context sensitive
framework for static analysis. This framework is based on one key observation:
a compositional static analysis often loses precision only on some critical
statements that need to be analyzed context sensitively. Our approach hybridly
inlines the critical statements and the summaries of non-critical statements of
each callee, thus avoiding the re-analysis of non-critical ones. In addition,
our analysis lazily summarizes the critical statements, by stopping propagating
the critical statements once the calling context accumulated is adequate.
Hybrid Inlining can be as precise as context sensitive top-down analysis. We
have designed and implemented a pointer analysis based on this framework. It
can analyze large Java programs from the Dacapo benchmark suite and industry in

Inlining just brings 65% and 1% additional time overhead on Dacapo and

spectral functions based on the axially deformed relativistic mean-field model
are developed to involve the NN-SRC. With the spectral functions, the inclusive

PWIA framework, including the quasi-elastic (QE) part and $ \Delta $ production

sensitive to the NN-SRC information. Finally, we provide a new method to

scientific research where randomized trials or intervention-based studies are
not feasible. Leveraging Shannon's seminal work on information theory, we
develop a causal discovery framework of ""predictive asymmetry"" for bivariate
$(X, Y)$. Predictive asymmetry is a central concept in information geometric
causal inference; it enables assessment of whether $X$ is a stronger predictor
of $Y$ or vice-versa. We propose a new metric called the Asymmetric Mutual
Information ($AMI$) and establish its key statistical properties. The $AMI$ is
not only able to detect complex non-linear association patterns in bivariate
data, but also is able to detect and quantify predictive asymmetry. Our
proposed methodology relies on scalable non-parametric density estimation using
fast Fourier transformation. The resulting estimation method is manyfold faster
than the classical bandwidth-based density estimation, while maintaining
comparable mean integrated squared error rates. We investigate key asymptotic
properties of the $AMI$ methodology; a new data-splitting technique is
developed to make statistical inference on predictive asymmetry using the
$AMI$. We illustrate the performance of the $AMI$ methodology through
simulation studies as well as multiple real data examples.

extracting answer spans for questions from dialogues. Dialogue context modeling
in DRC is tricky due to complex speaker information and noisy dialogue context.
To solve the two problems, previous research proposes two self-supervised tasks
respectively: guessing who a randomly masked speaker is according to the
dialogue and predicting which utterance in the dialogue contains the answer.
Although these tasks are effective, there are still urging problems: (1)
randomly masking speakers regardless of the question cannot map the speaker
mentioned in the question to the corresponding speaker in the dialogue, and
ignores the speaker-centric nature of utterances. This leads to wrong answer
extraction from utterances in unrelated interlocutors' scopes; (2) the single
utterance prediction, preferring utterances similar to the question, is limited
in finding answer-contained utterances not similar to the question. To
alleviate these problems, we first propose a new key utterances extracting
method. It performs prediction on the unit formed by several contiguous
utterances, which can realize more answer-contained utterances. Based on
utterances in the extracted units, we then propose Question-Interlocutor Scope
Realized Graph (QuISG) modeling. As a graph constructed on the text of
utterances, QuISG additionally involves the question and question-mentioning
speaker names as nodes. To realize interlocutor scopes, speakers in the
dialogue are connected with the words in their corresponding utterances.
Experiments on the benchmarks show that our method can achieve better and
competitive results against previous works.

consider deterministic nonlinear discrete-time systems whose inputs are

recursively feasible, in the sense that the optimization problems solved at
each iteration admit a solution. In this case, we provide novel conditions to
establish recursive robust stability properties for a general attractor,
meaning that the policies generated at each iteration ensure a robust
\KL-stability property with respect to a general state measure. We then derive
novel explicit bounds on the mismatch between the (suboptimal) value function
returned by PI at each iteration and the optimal one. Afterwards, motivated by
a counter-example that shows that PI may fail to be recursively feasible, we
modify PI so that recursive feasibility is guaranteed a priori under mild
conditions. This modified algorithm, called PI+, is shown to preserve the
recursive robust stability when the attractor is compact. Additionally, PI+
enjoys the same near-optimality properties as its PI counterpart under the same
assumptions. Therefore, PI+ is an attractive tool for generating near-optimal
stabilizing control of deterministic discrete-time nonlinear systems.

finite-part integration is applied in the exact evaluation of the one-sided,

$\mathrm{PV}\!\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}h(x) (\omega-x)^{-1}\mathrm{d}x$, Hilbert

terms -- the first is an infinite series of the finite-part of divergent
integrals of the form $\int_0^{\infty} h(x) x^{-\nu-k}\mathrm{d}x$, for some
non-integer $\nu$ and positive integers $k$, and the second is a contribution
arising from the singularity of the kernel of transformation. The first term is
precisely the result obtained when the kernel of transformation is binomially
expanded in inverse powers of $x$, followed by term-by-term integration and the
resulting divergent integrals assigned values equal to their finite-parts. In
all cases the finite-part contribution is present while the presence or absence

power generation above the steady-flow operating point are observed. To
characterize these dynamics, a nonlinear dynamical model for the rotation rate
and power extraction of a periodically surging turbine is derived and connected
to two potential-flow representations of the induction zone upstream of the
turbine. The model predictions for the time-averaged power extraction of the
turbine and the upstream flow velocity and pressure are compared against data
from experiments conducted with a surging-turbine apparatus in an open-circuit
wind tunnel at a diameter-based Reynolds number of $Re_D = 6.3\times10^5$ and
surge-velocity amplitudes of up to 24% of the wind speed. The combined modeling
approach captures trends in both the time-averaged power extraction and the
fluctuations in upstream flow quantities, while relying only on data from
steady-flow measurements. The sensitivity of the observed increases in
time-averaged power to steady-flow turbine characteristics is established, thus
clarifying the conditions under which these enhancements are possible. Finally,
the influence of unsteady fluid mechanics on time-averaged power extraction is
explored analytically. The theoretical framework and experimental validation
provide a cohesive modeling approach that can drive the design, control, and
optimization of turbines in unsteady flow conditions, as well as inform the
development of novel energy-harvesting systems that can leverage unsteady flows

technique. In this paper, we revisit the estimation of PPR and propose an

Compared to RF, ePPR has two main advantages. Firstly, its theoretical
consistency can be proved for more general regression functions as long as they
are $L^2$ integrable, and higher consistency rates can be achieved. Secondly,
ePPR does not split the samples, and thus each term of PPR is estimated using
the whole data, making the minimization more efficient and guaranteeing the
smoothness of the estimator. Extensive comparisons based on real data sets show
that ePPR is more efficient in regression and classification than RF and other
competitors. The efficacy of ePPR, a variant of Artificial Neural Networks
(ANN), demonstrates that with suitable statistical tuning, ANN can equal or
even exceed RF in dealing with small to medium-sized datasets. This revelation
challenges the widespread belief that ANN's superiority over RF is limited to

secular frequencies are a key factor that limits the stability of the critical

including active feedback stabilization of the RF voltage near the trap
electrodes, and achieve a stability of better than 5~ppm over 200~s for both
transverse and axial potentials. To evaluate the combined long-term stability
of the trap potential in both directions, we measure the zigzag (ZZ) mode
frequency near the CP, where the effect of instability in both trap directions
is substantially amplified. The short-term noise within a limited spectral
window is also suppressed by this scheme, as inferred from decoherence rates of
the ZZ mode measured at different frequencies with Ramsey fringes. We also
identify that the limitation of the secular frequency stability is mainly from
the imperfect temperature insensitivity of voltage dividers and RF detectors,

derives ESPIRiT maps from uniformly-undersampled multi-channel MR data by deep
learning. Methods: ESPIRiT, one commonly used parallel imaging reconstruction
technique, forms the images from undersampled MR k-space data using ESPIRiT
maps that effectively represents coil sensitivity information. Accurate ESPIRiT
map estimation requires quality coil sensitivity calibration or autocalibration
data. We present a U-Net based deep learning model to estimate the
multi-channel ESPIRiT maps directly from uniformly-undersampled multi-channel
multi-slice MR data. The model is trained using fully-sampled multi-slice axial
brain datasets from the same MR receiving coil system. To utilize subject-coil
geometric parameters available for each dataset, the training imposes a hybrid
loss on ESPIRiT maps at the original locations as well as their corresponding
locations within the standard reference multi-slice axial stack. The
performance of the approach was evaluated using publicly available T1-weighed
brain and cardiac data. Results: The proposed model robustly predicted
multi-channel ESPIRiT maps from uniformly-undersampled k-space data. They were
highly comparable to the reference ESPIRiT maps directly computed from 24
consecutive central k-space lines. Further, they led to excellent ESPIRiT
reconstruction performance even at high acceleration, exhibiting a similar
level of errors and artifacts to that by using reference ESPIRiT maps.
Conclusion: A new deep learning approach is developed to estimate ESPIRiT maps
directly from uniformly-undersampled MR data. It presents a general strategy
for calibrationless parallel imaging reconstruction through learning from coil

detection. Such methods commonly require the model to well reconstruct the
normal patterns but fail in the anomalies, and thus the anomalies can be
detected by evaluating the reconstruction errors. However, in practice, it's
usually difficult to control the generalization boundary of the model. The
model with an overly strong generalization capability can even well reconstruct
the abnormal regions, making them less distinguishable, while the model with a
poor generalization capability can not reconstruct those changeable
high-frequency components in the normal regions, which ultimately leads to
false positives. To tackle the above issue, we propose a new reconstruction
network where we reconstruct the original RGB image from its gray value edges
(EdgRec). Specifically, this is achieved by an UNet-type denoising autoencoder
with skip connections. The input edge and skip connections can well preserve
the high-frequency information in the original image. Meanwhile, the proposed
restoration task can force the network to memorize the normal low-frequency and
color information. Besides, the denoising design can prevent the model from
directly copying the original high-frequent components. To evaluate the
anomalies, we further propose a new interpretable hand-crafted evaluation
function that considers both the color and gradient differences. Our method
achieves competitive results on the challenging benchmark MVTec AD (97.8\% for
detection and 97.7\% for localization, AUROC). In addition, we conduct
experiments on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and show convincing results using RGB
images only. Our code will be available at

processes within weather and global climate models or coarse-scale turbulent
models, whose resolutions are too coarse to resolve small-scale processes.
These parameterizations are typically grounded on physically-based, yet
empirical, representations of the underlying small-scale processes. Machine
learning-based parameterizations have recently been proposed as an alternative
and have shown great promises to reduce uncertainties associated with
small-scale processes. Yet, those approaches still show some important
mismatches that are often attributed to stochasticity in the considered
process. This stochasticity can be due to noisy data, unresolved variables or
simply to the inherent chaotic nature of the process. To address these issues,
we develop a new type of parameterization (closure) which is based on a
Bayesian formalism for neural networks, to account for uncertainty
quantification, and includes memory, to account for the non-instantaneous
response of the closure. To overcome the curse of dimensionality of Bayesian
techniques in high-dimensional spaces, the Bayesian strategy is based on a
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling strategy that takes advantage of
the likelihood function and kinetic energy's gradients with respect to the
parameters to accelerate the sampling process. We apply the proposed Bayesian
history-based parameterization to the Lorenz '96 model in the presence of noisy

predict skillful forecasts of the resolved variables while returning
trustworthy uncertainty quantifications for different sources of error. This

necessary to combine acoustic features with other data such as facial
expressions, text, and motion capture. This research proposes to combine
acoustic and text information by applying a late-fusion approach consisting of
two steps. First, acoustic and text features are trained separately in deep
learning systems. Second, the prediction results from the deep learning systems
are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) to predict the final regression
score. Furthermore, the task in this research is dimensional emotion modeling
because it can enable a deeper analysis of affective states. Experimental
results show that this two-stage, late-fusion approach, obtains higher
performance than that of any one-stage processing, with a linear correlation
from one-stage to two-stage processing. This late-fusion approach improves
previous early fusion results measured in concordance correlation coefficients

representation of terrain using a computer program or procedure, with little to

algorithm based on a graph representation of fluvial erosion that offers
several novel improvements over existing algorithms. Namely, the use of a
height constraint map with two types of locally defined constraint strengths;
the ability to specify a realistic erosion strength via level of rainfall; and
the ability to carve realistic gorges. These novelties allow it to generate
more varied and realistic terrain by integrating additional parameters and
simulation processes, while being faster and offering more flexibility and ease
of use to terrain designers due to the nature and intuitiveness of these new
parameters and processes. This paper additionally reviews some common metrics
used to evaluate terrain generators, and suggests a completely new one that
contributes to a more holistic evaluation.

single-electron emitter. The emitter is composed of a quantum conductor and an
electrode, which is coupled via an Ohmic contact. At zero temperature, it has
been shown that a single electron can be injected coherently by applying an
unit-charge Lorentzian pulse on the electrode. As the electrode temperature
increases, we show that the electron emission approaches a time-dependence
Poisson process at long times. The Poissonian character is demonstrated from
the time-resolved full counting statistics. In the meantime, we show that the
emission events remain correlated, which is due to the Pauli exclusion
principle. The correlation is revealed from the emission rates of individual
electrons, from which a characteristic correlation time can be extracted. The
correlation time drops rapidly as the electrode temperature increases,
indicating that correlation can only play a non-negligible role at short times
in the high-temperature limit. By using the same procedure, we further show
that the quantum-to-classical crossover exhibits similar features when the
emission is driven by a Lorentzian pulse carrying two electron charge. Our
results show how the electron emission process is affected by thermal
fluctuations in a single-electron emitter.

(UANs) since the propagation speed is five orders of magnitude smaller than the
speed of light. In this case, space and time factors are strongly coupled to
determine the collisions of packet transmissions. To this end, this paper
analyzes the impact of spatial-time coupling on slotted medium access control
(MAC). We find that both inter-slot and intra-slot collisions may exist, and
the inter-slot collision may span multiple slots. The sending slot dependent
interference regions could be an annulus inside the whole transmission range.
It is pointed out that there exist collision-free regions when a guard interval
larger than a packet duration is used in the slot setting. In this sense, the
long slot brings spatial reuse in a transmission range. However, we further
find that the successful transmission probabilities and throughput are the same
for the slot lengths of one packet duration and two packet durations.
Simulation results show that the maximum successful transmission probability
and throughput can be achieved by a guard interval less than a packet duration,
which is much shorter than the existing slot setting in typical Slotted-ALOHA.
Simulations also show that the spatial impact is greater for vertical
transmission than for horizontal transmissions due to the longer vertical
transmission range in three-dimensional UANs.

microscopic details of individual metabolic reactions and the objective
functions of cells, and their predictions sensitively depend on such details.
In this study, we focus on the responses of metabolic systems to environmental
perturbations, rather than their metabolic states themselves, and theoretically
demonstrate a universal property of the responses independent of the systems'
details. With the help of a microeconomic theory, we show a simple relationship
between intracellular metabolic responses against nutrient abundance and
metabolic inhibition due to manipulation such as drug administration: these two
experimentally measurable quantities show a proportional relationship with a
negative coefficient. This quantitative relationship should hold in arbitrary
metabolic systems as long as the law of mass conservation holds and cells are
optimized for some objectives, but the true objective functions need not be
known. Through numerical calculations using large-scale metabolic networks such
as the E. coli core model, we confirmed that the relationship is valid from
abstract to detailed models. Because the relationship provides quantitative
predictions regarding metabolic responses without prior knowledge of systems,
our findings have implications for experimental applications in microbiology,
systems biology, metabolic engineering, and medicine, particularly for

Moreover, in both the pre-training and the downstream fine-tuning stages, joint

increased the number of sampling operations. Here we introduce a digitally

Recently, some deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results in
XMTC tasks. These models commonly predict scores for all labels by a fully
connected layer as the last layer of the model. However, such models can't
predict a relatively complete and variable-length label subset for each
document, because they select positive labels relevant to the document by a
fixed threshold or take top k labels in descending order of scores. A less
popular type of deep learning models called sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
focus on predicting variable-length positive labels in sequence style. However,
the labels in XMTC tasks are essentially an unordered set rather than an
ordered sequence, the default order of labels restrains Seq2Seq models in
training. To address this limitation in Seq2Seq, we propose an autoregressive
sequence-to-set model for XMTC tasks named OTSeq2Set. Our model generates
predictions in student-forcing scheme and is trained by a loss function based
on bipartite matching which enables permutation-invariance. Meanwhile, we use
the optimal transport distance as a measurement to force the model to focus on
the closest labels in semantic label space. Experiments show that OTSeq2Set
outperforms other competitive baselines on 4 benchmark datasets. Especially, on
the Wikipedia dataset with 31k labels, it outperforms the state-of-the-art

disks have a wide range of angular momenta, measured by the spin parameter
($\lambda$). In this study, we bring out the importance of inner angular
momentum($<$30 kpc), measured in terms of the halo spin parameter, on the
secular evolution of the bar using N-body simulations. We have varied the halo
spin parameter $\lambda$ from 0 to 0.1 for co-rotating (prograde) spinning
halos and one counter-rotating (retrograde) halo spin ($\lambda$=-0.1) with
respect to the disk. We report that as the halo spin increases, the buckling is
also triggered earlier and is followed by a second buckling phase in high-spin
halo models. The timescale for the second buckling is significantly longer than
the first buckling. We find that bar strength does not reduce significantly
after the buckling in all of our models, which provides new insights about the
role of inner halo angular momentum, unlike previous studies. Also, the buckled
bar can still transfer significant angular momentum to the halo in the secular
evolution phase, but it reduces with increasing halo spin. In the secular
evolution phase, the bar strength increases and saturates to nearly equal
values for all the models irrespective of halo spin and the sense of rotation
with respect to the disk. The final boxy/peanut shape is more pronounced
($\sim$20 $\%$) in high spin halos having higher angular momentum in the inner
region compared to non-rotating halos. We explain our results with angular
momentum exchanges between the disk and halo.

only discrete QCE transmit signals are allowed at each antenna, has gained
growing research interests due to its ability of reducing the hardware cost and
the energy consumption of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems. However, the discrete nature of QCE transmit signals greatly
complicates the precoding design. In this paper, we consider the QCE precoding
problem for a massive MIMO system with phase shift keying (PSK) modulation and
develop an efficient approach for solving the constructive interference (CI)
based problem formulation. Our approach is based on a custom-designed
(continuous) penalty model that is equivalent to the original discrete problem.
Specifically, the penalty model relaxes the discrete QCE constraint and
penalizes it in the objective with a negative $\ell_2$-norm term, which leads
to a non-smooth non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we resort to our
recently proposed alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. We show that the AO
algorithm admits closed-form updates at each iteration when applied to our
problem and thus can be efficiently implemented. Simulation results demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed approach over the existing algorithms.

(ICMEs) during Solar Cycles 23 and 24. The present analysis is primarily based
on the near-Earth ICME catalogue (Richardson and Cane, 2010). An important
aspect of this study is to understand the near-Earth and geoeffective aspects
of ICMEs in terms of their association (type II ICMEs) versus absence (non-type
II ICMEs) of decameter-hectometer (DH) type II radio bursts, detected by
Wind/WAVES and STEREOS/WAVES. Notably, DH type II radio bursts driven by a CME
indicate powerful MHD shocks leaving the inner corona and entering the
interplanetary medium. We find a drastic reduction in the occurrence of ICMEs
by 56% in Solar Cycle 24 compared to the previous cycle (64 versus 147 events).
Interestingly, despite a significant decrease in ICME/CME counts, both cycles
contain almost the same fraction of type II ICMEs (~47%). Our analysis reveals
that, even at a large distance of 1 AU, type II CMEs maintain significantly
higher speeds compared to non-type II events (523 km/s versus 440 km/s). While
there is an obvious trend of decrease in ICME transit times with increase in
the CME initial speed, there also exists a noticeable wide range of transit
times for a given CME speed. Contextually, Cycle 23 exhibits 10 events with
shorter transit times ranging between 20-40 hours of predominantly type II
categories while, interestingly, Cycle 24 almost completely lacks such ""fast""
events. We find a significant reduction in the parameter $V_{ICME} \times
B_{z}$, the dawn to dusk electric field, by 39% during Solar Cycle 24 in
comparison with the previous cycle. Further, $V_{ICME} \times B_{z}$ shows a
strong correlation with Dst index, which even surpasses the consideration of
$B_{z}$ and $V_{ICME}$ alone. The above results imply the crucial role of
$V_{ICME} \times B_{z}$ toward effectively modulating the geoeffectiveness of
ICMEs.

with the time-dependent source of scalar field in asymptotically anti-de Sitter

mechanism. In order to obtain the hairy black hole as the initial data for the
quench process, we first analyze the quasi-normal modes of the massive complex
scalar field on the Reissner-Nordstr\""om anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole
background. We find the dominant unstable modes for large and small RN-AdS
black holes come from the zero-damped modes and AdS modes, respectively. Then,
the unstable RN-AdS black holes are perturbed to trigger the transition to
hairy black holes. With the hairy black hole in hand, we specify a time
dependent scalar source for the system. As the source is turned on, the
electric charge, energy and scalar condensation of the system start to
oscillate with the entropy increasing monotonically. Finally, with the decay of
the scalar source, the system gradually settles down to a new state.
Interestingly, the final state of the evolution could be a hairy black hole
with less scalar condensation, a RN-AdS black hole or a Schwarzschild-AdS black
hole, which depends on the quench strength. However, as long as the quench
strength is large enough, the system always loses all the electric charge and
converges to the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole.

correlations to make predictions when a training set has unintended biases.
This tendency results in models not being generalizable to examples where the
correlations do not hold. Determining the spurious correlations QA models can
exploit is crucial in building generalizable QA models in real-world
applications; moreover, a method needs to be developed that prevents these
models from learning the spurious correlations even when a training set is
biased. In this study, we discovered that the relative position of an answer,
which is defined as the relative distance from an answer span to the closest
question-context overlap word, can be exploited by QA models as superficial
cues for making predictions. Specifically, we find that when the relative
positions in a training set are biased, the performance on examples with
relative positions unseen during training is significantly degraded. To
mitigate the performance degradation for unseen relative positions, we propose
an ensemble-based debiasing method that does not require prior knowledge about
the distribution of relative positions. We demonstrate that the proposed method
mitigates the models' reliance on relative positions using the biased and full
SQuAD dataset. We hope that this study can help enhance the generalization

the query sets, which may not always hold in practice. In particular, for each
task at testing time, the classes effectively present in the unlabeled query
set are known a priori, and correspond exactly to the set of classes
represented in the labeled support set. We relax these assumptions and extend
current benchmarks, so that the query-set classes of a given task are unknown,
but just belong to a much larger set of possible classes. Our setting could be
viewed as an instance of the challenging yet practical problem of extremely
imbalanced K-way classification, K being much larger than the values typically
used in standard benchmarks, and with potentially irrelevant supervision from
the support set. Expectedly, our setting incurs drops in the performances of
state-of-the-art methods. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a
PrimAl Dual Minimum Description LEngth (PADDLE) formulation, which balances
data-fitting accuracy and model complexity for a given few-shot task, under
supervision constraints from the support set. Our constrained MDL-like
objective promotes competition among a large set of possible classes,
preserving only effective classes that befit better the data of a few-shot
task. It is hyperparameter free, and could be applied on top of any base-class
training. Furthermore, we derive a fast block coordinate descent algorithm for
optimizing our objective, with convergence guarantee, and a linear
computational complexity at each iteration. Comprehensive experiments over the
standard few-shot datasets and the more realistic and challenging i-Nat dataset
show highly competitive performances of our method, more so when the numbers of
possible classes in the tasks increase. Our code is publicly available at

  $Purpose:$ Our aim is to analyze the sensitivity of charge-exchange ($p, n$)
reactions to the neutron density distribution $\rho_{n}$ and constrain the
neutron characteristics in the nuclear structure models.
  $Method:$ By combing the folding and the mean-field models, the
nucleon-nucleus ($NA$) potential can be obtained from the nuclear density
distribution. Further, the ($p, p$) and ($p, n$) cross sections for $^{48}$Ca
and $^{208}$Pb are calculated following the distorted-wave Born approximation
(DWBA) method.
  $Results:$ Compared with the ($p, p$) cross section, the effects of
$\rho_{n}$ variation on the ($p, n$) cross section are significant, which is
due to the impact of isovector properties. Based on the global folding model
analyses of data, it is found that $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb have relatively
large neutron skin thickness $\Delta R_{n p}$.
  $Conclusions:$ Results illustrate that the charge-exchange ($p, n$) reaction

electricity during the period of power crisis (""dumsor"" period) in Ghana using
two-state Markov switching autoregressive (MS-AR) and autoregressive (AR)
models. Hourly data between the periods of January 1, 2014, and December 31,
2014 was obtained from the Ghana Grid company and used for the study. Using
different information criteria, the MS(2)-AR(4) is selected as the optimal
model to describe the dynamic behaviour of electricity consumption during
periods of power crisis in Ghana. The parameters of the MS(2)-AR(4) model are
then estimated using the expectation-maximization algorithm. From the results,
the likelihood of staying under a low electricity consumption regime is
estimated to be 87\%. The expected duration for a low electricity consumption
regime is 7.8 hours daily, and the high electricity consumption regime is
expected to last 2.3 hours daily. The proposed model is robust as compared to
the autoregressive model because it effectively captures the dynamics of
electricity demand over time through the peaks and significant fluctuations in
consumption patterns. Similarly, the model can identify distinct regime changes
linked to electricity consumption during periods of power crises.

  Prediction for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis","Findings of EMNLP 2022",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multimodal representation learning is a challenging task in which previous
work mostly focus on either uni-modality pre-training or cross-modality fusion.
In fact, we regard modeling multimodal representation as building a skyscraper,
where laying stable foundation and designing the main structure are equally
essential. The former is like encoding robust uni-modal representation while
the later is like integrating interactive information among different
modalities, both of which are critical to learning an effective multimodal
representation. Recently, contrastive learning has been successfully applied in
representation learning, which can be utilized as the pillar of the skyscraper
and benefit the model to extract the most important features contained in the
multimodal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named MultiModal
Contrastive Learning (MMCL) for multimodal representation to capture intra- and
inter-modality dynamics simultaneously. Specifically, we devise uni-modal
contrastive coding with an efficient uni-modal feature augmentation strategy to
filter inherent noise contained in acoustic and visual modality and acquire
more robust uni-modality representations. Besides, a pseudo siamese network is
presented to predict representation across different modalities, which
successfully captures cross-modal dynamics. Moreover, we design two contrastive
learning tasks, instance- and sentiment-based contrastive learning, to promote
the process of prediction and learn more interactive information related to
sentiment. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets demonstrate
that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods.

from two problems: First, VLPs tend to rely on language biases in datasets and
fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Second, they are
inefficient in terms of memory footprint and computation. Although promising
progress has been made in both problems, most existing works tackle them
independently. To facilitate the application of VLP to VQA tasks, it is
imperative to jointly study VLP compression and OOD robustness, which, however,
has not yet been explored. In this paper, we investigate whether a VLP can be
compressed and debiased simultaneously by searching sparse and robust
subnetworks. To this end, we conduct extensive experiments with LXMERT, a
representative VLP, on the OOD dataset VQA-CP v2. We systematically study the
design of a training and compression pipeline to search the subnetworks, as
well as the assignment of sparsity to different modality-specific modules. Our
results show that there indeed exist sparse and robust LXMERT subnetworks,
which significantly outperform the full model (without debiasing) with much
fewer parameters. These subnetworks also exceed the current SoTA debiasing
models with comparable or fewer parameters. We will release the codes on

locality of the correlated physics. In this work we critically review
approaches to recombine these fragmented solutions in order to compute
non-local expectation values, including the total energy. Starting from the

contributions to expectation values spanning multiple fragments simultaneously,
thereby alleviating the fundamental locality approximation of the embedding. We
clearly demonstrate the value of these introduced functionals for reliable

desired accuracy compared to traditional approaches in ab initio wave~function

popularity in recent years. However, many works found that the social biases
hidden in CLIP easily manifest in downstream tasks, especially in image
retrieval, which can have harmful effects on human society. In this work, we
propose FairCLIP to eliminate the social bias in CLIP-based image retrieval
without damaging the retrieval performance achieving the compatibility between
the debiasing effect and the retrieval performance. FairCLIP is divided into
two steps: Attribute Prototype Learning (APL) and Representation Neutralization
(RN). In the first step, we extract the concepts needed for debiasing in CLIP.
We use the query with learnable word vector prefixes as the extraction
structure. In the second step, we first divide the attributes into target and
bias attributes. By analysis, we find that both attributes have an impact on
the bias. Therefore, we try to eliminate the bias by using Re-Representation
Matrix (RRM) to achieve the neutralization of the representation. We compare
the debiasing effect and retrieval performance with other methods, and
experiments demonstrate that FairCLIP can achieve the best compatibility.
Although FairCLIP is used to eliminate bias in image retrieval, it achieves the
neutralization of the representation which is common to all CLIP downstream
tasks. This means that FairCLIP can be applied as a general debiasing method
for other fairness issues related to CLIP.

filament. To understand the eruption process with these characteristics, we
conducted a data-constrained magnetohydrodynamics simulation using a nonlinear
force-free field of the active region about an hour before the flare as the
initial condition. Our simulation reproduces the filament eruption observed in
the Ha images of GONG and the 304 angstrom images of SDO/AIA and suggests that
two mechanisms can possibly contribute to the magnetic eruption. One is the
torus instability of the pre-existing magnetic flux rope (MFR), and the other
is upward pushing by magnetic loops newly formed below the MFR via continuous
magnetic reconnection between two sheared magnetic arcades. The presence of
this reconnection is evidenced by the SDO/AIA observations of the 1600 angstrom
brightening in the footpoints of the sheared arcades at the flare onset. To
clarify which process is more essential for the eruption, we performed an
experimental simulation in which the reconnection between the sheared field
lines is suppressed. In this case too, the MFR could erupt, but at a much
reduced rising speed. We interpret this result as indicating that the eruption
is not only driven by the torus instability, but additionally accelerated by
newly formed and rising magnetic loops under continuous reconnection.

four statistics and finally converges to a real value under certain conditions.
Based on TBTM, we carry out theoretical analysis, malicious attack resistance,

results show that TBTM satisfies service prediction, global trust analysis,
high security, and excellent performance in multi-domain complex scenarios.
Compared with the existing trust management schemes, TBTM realizes
cross-scenario interaction and two-way trust management, and simultaneously
meets the characteristics of traceability, tamper-proof, attack resistance, and

queries, and reducing space requirements. An acyclic join dependency (AJD) is
lossless with respect to a universal relation if joining the projections
associated with the schema results in the original universal relation. An
intuitive and standard measure of loss entailed by an AJD is the number of
redundant tuples generated by the acyclic join. Recent work has shown that the
loss of an AJD can also be characterized by an information-theoretic measure.
Motivated by the problem of automatically fitting an acyclic schema to a
universal relation, we investigate the connection between these two
characterizations of loss. We first show that the loss of an AJD is captured
using the notion of KL-Divergence. We then show that the KL-divergence can be
used to bound the number of redundant tuples. We prove a deterministic lower
bound on the percentage of redundant tuples. For an upper bound, we propose a

recommender systems because it captures dynamic and diverse preferences from
users' real-time increasing behaviors. Unlike the standard autoregressive
training strategy, future data (also available during training) has been used
to facilitate model training as it provides richer signals about user's current
interests and can be used to improve the recommendation quality. However, these
methods suffer from a severe training-inference gap, i.e., both past and future
contexts are modeled by the same encoder when training, while only historical
behaviors are available during inference. This discrepancy leads to potential
performance degradation. To alleviate the training-inference gap, we propose a
new framework DualRec, which achieves past-future disentanglement and
past-future mutual enhancement by a novel dual network. Specifically, a dual
network structure is exploited to model the past and future context separately.
And a bi-directional knowledge transferring mechanism enhances the knowledge
learnt by the dual network. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over baseline methods. Besides, we
demonstrate the compatibility of DualRec by instantiating using RNN,
Transformer, and filter-MLP as backbones. Further empirical analysis verifies
the high utility of modeling future contexts under our DualRec framework. The

priors to inverse problems while still retaining the control and insight of a
variational regularization method. Moreover, unsupervised learning, without
paired training data, allows the learned regularizer to remain flexible to
changes in the forward problem such as noise level, sampling pattern or coil
sensitivities. One such approach uses generative models, trained on
ground-truth images, as priors for inverse problems, penalizing reconstructions
far from images the generator can produce. In this work, we utilize variational
autoencoders (VAEs) that generate not only an image but also a covariance
uncertainty matrix for each image. The covariance can model changing
uncertainty dependencies caused by structure in the image, such as edges or
objects, and provides a new distance metric from the manifold of learned
images. We demonstrate these novel generative regularizers on radially
sub-sampled MRI knee measurements from the fastMRI dataset and compare them to
other unlearned, unsupervised and supervised methods. Our results show that the

now been mostly limited to enzymes, which narrows the application of HNFs
especially in food industry. Here we show that for many types of food protein,
enzymatic hydrolysis can improve its ability to form versatile HNFs, or even
induce HNF formation where the protein source did not show its formation a
priori. The treatment of enzymatic hydrolysis increases the flexibility of such
proteins and induces nucleation sites of HNFs in the early formation stage by
decomposing those proteins into polypeptides. In particular, the HNF prepared
with soy protein hydrolysate further shows a high loading capacity of
water-soluble Monascus red, reaching up to 554.1 mg per gram of HNF. Its
stabilization towards lipophilic curcumin is similarly impressive with the
loading capacity reaching 21.9 mg per gram of HNF. This HNF could also
effectively protect these two sensitive natural pigments in harsh environments.
This research significantly broadens the available protein source for HNF

uncertified controller is stabilizing, the performance loss caused by switching

stochastic optimal control problem is defined to find a closed-loop control law

multiplicative feedback law; thus, only the control direction is regulated,
while the magnitude corresponds to the nominal one, enabling its use for solid

notable change in the onset voltage, which implies that the plate thickness

only. The motivation behind this research is to design an effective approach
filtering out hybrid spam e-mails to avoid situations where traditional
text-based or image-baesd only filters fail to detect hybrid spam e-mails. To
the best of our knowledge, a few studies have been conducted with the goal of
detecting hybrid spam e-mails. Ordinarily, Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
technology is used to eliminate the image parts of spam by transforming images
into text. However, the research questions are that although OCR scanning is a
very successful technique in processing text-and-image hybrid spam, it is not
an effective solution for dealing with huge quantities due to the CPU power
required and the execution time it takes to scan e-mail files. And the OCR
techniques are not always reliable in the transformation processes. To address
such problems, we propose new late multi-modal fusion training frameworks for a
text-and-image hybrid spam e-mail filtering system compared to the classical
early fusion detection frameworks based on the OCR method. Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and Continuous Bag of Words were implemented to extract features
from image and text parts of hybrid spam respectively, whereas generated
features were fed to sigmoid layer and Machine Learning based classifiers

approaches have drawn much attention in recent studies for this problem.
Despite non-convexity, many two-stage algorithms provably converge to the
underlying solution linearly when appropriately initialized. However, in terms
of sample complexity, the bottleneck of those algorithms often comes from the
initialization stage. Although the refinement stage usually needs only
$m=\Omega(s\log n)$ measurements, the widely used spectral initialization in
the initialization stage requires $m=\Omega(s^2\log n)$ measurements to produce

are sufficient to produce a desired initial guess. When the underlying signal

message into a suspicious form, steganography is advantageous for its
resilience to attacks by concealing the message in an innocent-looking cover
signal. Minimal distortion steganography, one of the mainstream steganography
frameworks, embeds messages while minimizing the distortion caused by the
modification on the cover elements. Due to the unavailability of the original
cover signal for the receiver, message embedding is realized by finding the
coset leader of the syndrome function of steganographic codes migrated from
channel coding, which is complex and has limited performance. Fortunately, deep
generative models and the robust semantic of generated data make it possible
for the receiver to perfectly reproduce the cover signal from the stego signal.
With this advantage, we propose cover-reproducible steganography where the

Specifically, the decoding process of arithmetic coding is used for message
embedding and its encoding process is regarded as message extraction. Taking

the feasibility of cover-reproducible steganography. Steganalysis experiments

take a glimpse into the properties and the mechanisms that shape a nucleus
through cometary activity. If the origin of these pits is still a matter of
debate, multiple studies have recently suggested that known phase transitions
alone could not have carved these morphological features on the surface of
67P/C-G. We want to understand how the progressive modification of 67P's
surface due to cometary activity might have affected the characteristics of
pits. In particular, we aim to understand whether signatures of the formation
mechanism of these morphological features can still be identified. To quantify
the amount of erosion sustained at the surface of 67P since it arrived on its
currently observed orbit, we selected 380 facets of a medium-resolution shape
model of the nucleus, sampling 30 pits across the surface. We computed the
surface energy balance with a high temporal resolution, including shadowing and
self-heating. We then applied a thermal evolution model to assess the amount of
erosion sustained after ten orbital revolutions under current illumination
conditions. We find that the maximum erosion sustained after ten orbital
revolutions is on the order of 80 m, for facets located in the southern
hemisphere. We thus confirm that progressive erosion cannot form pits and
alcoves, as local erosion is much lower than their observed depth and diameter.
We find that plateaus tend to erode more than bottoms, especially for the
deepest depressions, and that some differential erosion can affect their
morphology. As a general rule, our results suggest that sharp morphological
features tend to be erased by progressive erosion. This study supports the
assumption that deep circular pits, such as Seth1, are the least processed
morphological features at the surface of 67P, or the best preserved since their
formation.

the plasmon from phonon modes, revealing the existence of Landau damping to the

lifetime at zero momentum responds dramatically to the bandgap evolution
associated with the CDW transition. The interband transitions near the Fermi

of plasmons, while such a channel in the CDW phase is suppressed due to the CDW

states from speech. SER is extremely prevalent in helping dialogue systems to
truly understand our emotions and become a trustworthy human conversational

abundant labelled data for powerful models like deep neural networks.
Pre-trained complex models on large-scale speech datasets have been
successfully applied to SER via transfer learning. However, fine-tuning complex
models still requires large memory space and results in low inference
efficiency. In this paper, we argue achieving a fast yet effective SER is
possible with self-distillation, a method of simultaneously fine-tuning a
pretrained model and training shallower versions of itself. The benefits of our
self-distillation framework are threefold: (1) the adoption of
self-distillation method upon the acoustic modality breaks through the limited
ground-truth of speech data, and outperforms the existing models' performance
on an SER dataset; (2) executing powerful models at different depth can achieve
adaptive accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on resource-limited edge devices; (3) a
new fine-tuning process rather than training from scratch for self-distillation
leads to faster learning time and the state-of-the-art accuracy on data with
small quantities of label information.

indicators of He-enhanced second generation populations in globular clusters,
specifically extreme/blue horizontal branch stars. Out of 149 globular clusters
in the field of view, 58 have far ultraviolet (FUV) counterparts with
magnitudes brighter than 28.5. Six of these FUV-deteced globular clusters are
also detected in X-rays, including one ultraluminous X-ray source ($L_X >
10^{39}$ erg/s). While optically bright clusters corresponded to brighter FUV
counterparts, we observe FUV emission from both metal-rich and metal-poor
clusters, which implies that the FUV excess is not dependent on optical colour.
We also find no evidence that the cluster size influences the FUV emission. The
clusters with X-ray emission are not unusually FUV bright, which suggests that
even the ultraluminous X-ray source does not provide significant FUV
contributions. NGC 1399 is only the fourth galaxy to have its globular cluster

In partially observable or collaborative settings (e.g., POMDPs and Dec-

fully observable problem as well as bounding (convex) approximators of the

the higher SOC range. Nevertheless, said dielectric behaviour is a highly
desired property, particularly as an input parameter for charged kinetic Monte
Carlo simulations, one of the most promising modeling techniques for energy

based on a machine-learned repulsive potential in order to overcome the
computational hurdles of sampling the long-ranged Coulomb interactions within
this material, as experienced by the charge carriers within. This approach is
rather novel due to computational cost, but best suited for investigating our
specific property of interest. For the first time, we discover a mostly linear
dependency of the relative permittivity on the SOC, from ca. 7 at SOC 0% to ca.
25 at SOC 100%. In doing so, we also present a straightforward approach that
can be used in future research for other intercalation compounds -- once
sufficiently fast and long-ranged computational methods, e.g. linear-scaling
DFT, a good DFTB parametrization, or atomic potentials with inbuilt
electrostatics, become available. However, while the presented qualitative
behaviour is robust and our results compare favourably with the few
experimental studies available, we stress that quantitative results are
strongly dependent on our estimation of the partial charge transfer from the
intercalated Li-ion to the carbon host structure, and need to be verified by
further experiments and calculations. Yet, our research shows that in

pieces called chemical words and then apply advanced natural language
processing techniques for tasks such as de novo drug design, property
prediction, and binding affinity prediction. However, the fundamental building
blocks of these models, chemical words, have not yet been studied from a

models rely on chemically meaningful building blocks or arbitrary chemical
subsequences? To answer this question, we first propose a novel pipeline to
highlight the key chemical words for strong binding to a protein family and
then study the substructures designated by the key chemical words for three
protein families. For all three families, we find extensive evidence in the

by mainstream graphical cards due to limited video memory. Therefore, most
existing 3D medical image segmentation methods use patch-based models, which
ignores global context information that is useful in accurate segmentation and
has low inference efficiency. To address these problems, we propose a
super-resolution (SR) guided patch-free 3D medical image segmentation framework
that can realize HR segmentation with global information of low-resolution (LR)
input. The framework contains two tasks: semantic segmentation (main task) and
super resolution (auxiliary task). To balance the information loss with the LR
input, we introduce a Self-Supervised Guidance Module (SGM), which employs a
selective search method to crop a HR patch from the original image as
restoration guidance. Multi-scale convolutional layers are used to mitigate the
scale-inconsistency between the HR guidance features and the LR features.
Moreover, we propose a Task-Fusion Module (TFM) to exploit the inter
connections between segmentation and SR task. This module can also be used for
Test Phase Fine-tuning (TPF), leading to a better model generalization ability.
When predicting, only the main segmentation task is needed, while other modules
can be removed to accelerate the inference. The experiments results on two
different datasets show that our framework outperforms current patch-based and
patch-free models. Our model also has a four times higher inference speed
compared to traditional patch-based methods. Our codes are available at:

conversational short-phrase speaker diarization (CSSD) challenge which
particularly focuses on short-phrase conversations with a new evaluation metric

explore three kinds of typical speaker diarization systems, which are spectral
clustering(SC) based diarization, target-speaker voice activity
detection(TS-VAD) and end-to-end neural diarization(EEND) respectively. Our
major findings are summarized as follows. First, the SC approach is more
favored over the other two approaches under the new CDER metric. Second, tuning
on hyperparameters is essential to CDER for all three types of speaker
diarization systems. Specifically, CDER becomes smaller when the length of
sub-segments setting longer. Finally, multi-system fusion through DOVER-LAP
will worsen the CDER metric on the challenge data. Our submitted SC system
eventually ranks the third place in the challenge.

work is aimed at identifying stars with shell-signatures via a search for
strong FeII multiplet 42 lines at 4924, 5018, 5169A in archival LAMOST spectra.
Candidates were selected by probing the FeII 42 lines in the spectra of a
sample of colour-preselected early-type stars using a modified version of the
MKCLASS code and then categorised by visual inspection of their spectra. We
identified 75 stars showing conspicuous shell features, 43 Am/CP1 stars, 12
Ap/CP2 stars, and three objects with composite spectra. Spectral types and
equivalent width measurements of the FeII 42 lines are presented for the sample
of shell stars. Except for three objects, all shell stars appear significantly
removed from the ZAMS in the colour-magnitude diagram, which is likely due to
extinction by circumstellar material. We find a correlation between the
equivalent width of the 5169A line and the distance to the locus of the
main-sequence stars (the larger the IR-excess, the stronger the 5169A line) and
studied the variability of the shell star sample using TESS data, identifying a
very high proportion of double stars. All but 14 shell stars are new
discoveries, which highlights the efficiency of the here presented novel
approach to identify stars with subtle shell features. This study may be used
as a blueprint for discovering these objects in massive spectral databases.

However, we show that, for $\gamma$-ray sources based on Compton scattering of

approximating small scales in multiscale systems with neural networks. The
choice of loss function and associated training procedure has a large effect on
the accuracy and stability of the resulting neural closure model. In this work,
we systematically compare three distinct procedures: ""derivative fitting"",
""trajectory fitting"" with discretise-then-optimise, and ""trajectory fitting""
with optimise-then-discretise. Derivative fitting is conceptually the simplest
and computationally the most efficient approach and is found to perform
reasonably well on one of the test problems (Kuramoto-Sivashinsky) but poorly
on the other (Burgers). Trajectory fitting is computationally more expensive
but is more robust and is therefore the preferred approach. Of the two
trajectory fitting procedures, the discretise-then-optimise approach produces
more accurate models than the optimise-then-discretise approach. While the
optimise-then-discretise approach can still produce accurate models, care must
be taken in choosing the length of the trajectories used for training, in order
to train the models on long-term behaviour while still producing reasonably
accurate gradients during training. Two existing theorems are interpreted in a
novel way that gives insight into the long-term accuracy of a neural closure
model based on how accurate it is in the short term.

this is rarely done in medical image segmentation studies. In this paper, we
aim to estimate what is the typical confidence that can be expected in such

using a standard deep learning model (U-net) and a classical task from the
Medical Segmentation Decathlon. We extensively study precision estimation using
both Gaussian assumption and bootstrapping (which does not require any

the structure of discourse. According to the theory, local coherence of
discourse arises from the manner and extent to which successive utterances make
reference to the same entities. In this paper, we investigate the connection
between centering theory and modern coreference resolution systems. We provide
an operationalization of centering and systematically investigate if neural
coreference resolvers adhere to the rules of centering theory by defining
various discourse metrics and developing a search-based methodology. Our
information-theoretic analysis reveals a positive dependence between
coreference and centering; but also shows that high-quality neural coreference
resolvers may not benefit much from explicitly modeling centering ideas. Our
analysis further shows that contextualized embeddings contain much of the
coherence information, which helps explain why CT can only provide little gains
to modern neural coreference resolvers which make use of pretrained
representations. Finally, we discuss factors that contribute to coreference
which are not modeled by CT such as world knowledge and recency bias. We
formulate a version of CT that also models recency and show that it captures
coreference information better compared to vanilla CT.

spread centrality is a distinct centrality measure and serves as another graph
invariant for distinguishing graphs, we found experimental evidence that
vertices ranked by the spread centrality and those ranked by eigenvector

spectrum, measured in the vanishing power limit, can acquire an intricate fine
structure associated with the qubit-induced cascades of coherent single-photon
down-conversion processes. This many-body effect is hard to capture by a
brute-force numerics and it is sensitive to the light-matter coupling

example case of a superconducting fluxonium qubit coupled to a long

readily exceed a few MHz, which is plenty to overcome the usual decoherence

gauge choice, in which the qubit circuit interacts with radiation via the

However, there are several challenges when adopting EEs for diarisation, from
which we tackle two key problems. First, the evaluation is not straightforward
because the features required for better performance differ between speaker
verification and diarisation. We show that better performance on widely adopted
speaker verification evaluation protocols does not lead to better diarisation
performance. Second, embedding extractors have not seen utterances in which
multiple speakers exist. These inputs are inevitably present in speaker
diarisation because of overlapped speech and speaker changes; they degrade the
performance. To mitigate the first problem, we generate speaker verification
evaluation protocols that mimic the diarisation scenario better. We propose two
data augmentation techniques to alleviate the second problem, making embedding
extractors aware of overlapped speech or speaker change input. One technique
generates overlapped speech segments, and the other generates segments where
two speakers utter sequentially. Extensive experimental results using three
state-of-the-art speaker embedding extractors demonstrate that both proposed
approaches are effective.

major steps. Firstly, we present a concise collection of 62 meta-features that
address the problem of information cancellation when aggregation measure values
involving positive and negative measurements. Secondly, we describe two
different approaches for synthetic data generation intending to enlarge the
training data. Thirdly, we fit a set of pre-defined classification models for
each classification problem while optimizing their hyperparameters using grid
search. The goal is to create a meta-dataset such that each row denotes a
multilabel instance describing a specific problem. The features of these
meta-instances denote the statistical properties of the generated datasets,
while the labels encode the grid search results as binary vectors such that
best-performing models are positively labeled. Finally, we tackle the model

conditioning on non-extinction, or adding immigration. In both cases we show
that the process converges in distribution without normalization to a
nondegenerate compound-Poisson limit law. The proofs rely on the shape function
technique, worked out by Kersting (2020).

efficient FL framework for resource-limited IIoT networks that integrates DNN
partition technique into the standard FL mechanism, wherein IIoT devices
perform local model training over the bottom layers of the objective DNN, and
offload the top layers to the edge gateway side. Considering imbalanced data
distribution, we derive the device-specific participation rate to involve the
devices with better data distribution in more communication rounds. Upon
deriving the device-specific participation rate, we propose to minimize the
training delay under the constraints of device-specific participation rate,
energy consumption and memory usage. To this end, we formulate a joint
optimization problem of device scheduling and resource allocation (i.e. DNN
partition point, channel assignment, transmit power, and computation
frequency), and solve the long-term min-max mixed integer non-linear
programming based on the Lyapunov technique. In particular, the proposed
dynamic device scheduling and resource allocation (DDSRA) algorithm can achieve
a trade-off to balance the training delay minimization and FL performance. We
also provide the FL convergence bound for the DDSRA algorithm with both convex

with a stress tensor contribution coupled to a Yang-Mills flow for the Maxwell
field. We argue that this flow is well-posed for static spacetimes with pure
electric or magnetic potentialsand show it preserves both non-extremal and
extremal black hole horizons. In the latter case we find the flow of the near
horizon geometry decouples from that of the exterior. The Schwarzschild black
hole is an unstable fixed point of Ricci flow for static spacetimes. Here we
consider flows of the Reissner-Nordstr\""om (RN) fixed point. The magnetic RN
solution becomes a stable fixed point of the flow for sufficient charge.
However we find that the electric RN black hole is always unstable. Numerically
solving the flow starting with a spherically symmetric perturbation of a
non-extremal RN solution, we find similar behaviour in the electric case to the
Ricci flows of perturbed Schwarzschild, namely the horizon shrinks to a
singularity in finite time or expands forever. In the magnetic case, a
perturbed unstable RN solution has a similar expanding behaviour, but a
perturbation that decreases the horizon size flows to a stable black hole
solution rather than a singularity. For extremal RN we solve the near horizon
flow for spherical symmetry exactly, and see in the electric case two unstable
directions which flow to singularities in finite flow time. However, even
turning these off, and fixing the near horizon geometry to be that of RN, we
numerically show that the flows appear to become singular in the vicinity of
its horizon.

auto-regression, deep learning and variational inference to model non-linear

methods are derived from the minimization of errors between synthesized and

contrast with integral-equation-based methods. Pressure matching is widely used
in the optimization-based sound field reproduction methods because of its
simplicity of implementation. Its cost function is defined as the synthesis
errors at multiple control points inside the target region; then, the driving
signals of the loudspeakers are obtained by solving a least-squares problem.
However, in pressure matching, the region between the control points is not
taken into consideration. We define the cost function as the regional
integration of the synthesis error over the target region. On the basis of the
kernel interpolation of the sound field, this cost function is represented as
the weighted square error of the synthesized pressures at the control points.
Experimental results indicate that the proposed weighted pressure matching

in both CANDELS HST imaging and JWST CEERS NIRCam images to enable a comparison

classifications, with each galaxy in the sample classified by three different
individuals. We also measure quantitative morphologies using the publicly
available codes across all seven NIRCam filters. Using these measurements, we
present the fraction of galaxies of each morphological type as a function of
redshift. Overall, we find that galaxies at z>3 have a wide diversity of
morphologies. Galaxies with disks make up a total of 60\% of galaxies at z=3
and this fraction drops to ~30% at z=6-9, while galaxies with spheroids make up
~30-40% across the whole redshift range and pure spheroids with no evidence for
disks or irregular features make up ~20%. The fraction of galaxies with
irregular features is roughly constant at all redshifts (~40-50%), while those
that are purely irregular increases from ~12% to ~20% at z>4.5. We note that
these are apparent fractions as many selection effects impact the visibility of
morphological features at high redshift. The distributions of S\'ersic index,
size, and axis ratios show significant differences between the morphological
groups. Spheroid Only galaxies have a higher S\'ersic index, smaller size, and
higher axis ratio than Disk/Irregular galaxies. Across all redshifts, smaller
spheroid and disk galaxies tend to be rounder. Overall, these trends suggest
that galaxies with established disks and spheroids exist across the full

tunable, doped graphene has emerged as a promising candidate to replace this
semiconducting material in flexible miniaturized electronic devices. Indeed,
heteroatom co-doping (i.e. with boron and/or nitrogen) is an appealing strategy
to tune both its structural and electronic properties, possibly inducing a band
gap in graphene. However, presently synthesized BN-doped carbon-based materials
are randomly doped, leading to their electronic properties not being
reproducible. Using first-principles techniques, the present study investigates
the periodic doping of graphene with borazine-like rings in order to search for
an entirely new class of BCN hybrid 2D materials exhibiting high stabilities
and optimized band gaps for opto-electronic applications. Ab initio
calculations show that BN-ring doped graphene displays cohesive energies
comparable with benchmark ideal periodic BCN systems (such as BC$_3$,
C$_3$N$_4$, BC$_2$N) with a decreasing linear trend toward high concentrations
of BN-rings. Band gaps of BN-ring doped graphene systems are calculated using
many-body perturbation techniques and are found to be sensitive to the doping
pattern and to be considerably larger for high concentrations of BN rings
exhibiting the same orientation. These predictions suggest that BN-ring doped
graphene materials could be interesting candidates for the next generation of
optoelectronic devices and open new opportunities for their synthesis using

exploration driving data in the real world is impractical and dangerous. While

Sim2Seg, a re-imagining of RCAN that crosses the visual reality gap for
off-road autonomous driving, without using any real-world data. This is done by
learning to translate randomized simulation images into simulated segmentation

This allows us to train an end-to-end RL policy in simulation, and directly

uses a low-dimensional physics-based model to create balanced humanoid avatars

height shifting and push exertions, while remaining upright and balanced. We
accomplish this by combining the popular inverted-pendulum model with an
ankle-feedback torque and variable leg-length mechanism to create a
controllable solution that can adapt to unforeseen circumstances in real-time
without key-framed data, any offline pre-processing, or on-line optimizations
joint torque computations. We explain and address oversimplifications and
limitations with the basic IP model and the reasons for extending the model by
means of additional control mechanisms. We demonstrate a simple and fast
approach for extending the IP model based on an ankle-torque and variable leg
lengths approximation without hindering the extremely attractive properties
(i.e., computational speed, robustness, and simplicity) that make the IP model
so ideal for generating upright responsive balancing biped movements. Finally,
while our technique focuses on lower body motions, it can, nevertheless, handle
both small and large push forces even during terrain height variations.
Moreover, our model effectively creates human-like motions that synthesize
low-level upright stepping movements, and can be combined with additional
controller techniques to produce whole body autonomous agents.

systems directly without any assumptions. They are therefore ideal objects for
a comparison of Gaia data release 3 (GDR3) parallax data, especially since GDR3
presents the results of the non-single star (NSS) analysis that potentially
results in improved parallaxes.
  An sample of 192 orbital parallax determinations for 186 systems is compiled
from the literature. The stars are also potentially in wide binary systems, and
37 candidates were found.
  Only for 21 objects does the NSS analysis provide information, including 8
from the astrometric binary pipeline, for which the parallaxes do improve
significantly compared to those in the main catalogue. It appears that most of
the objects in the sample are eliminated in the pre-filtering stage of the NSS
analysis.
  The difference between the orbital parallax and the (best) \G\ parallax was
finally obtained for 170 objects. When objects with large parallax errors or
unrealistically large differences between the orbital and \G\ parallaxes are
eliminated, and objects with a GOF < 100 or <8 are selected, samples of 68 and
20 stars remain.
  Three recipes that calculate the PZPO are tested. After these corrections are
applied the remaining parallax differences are formally consistent with zero
within the error bar for all three recipes.
  The method of using orbital parallaxes is shown to work, but the full
potential is not reached as an improved parallax from the NSS analysis is
available for only few systems. In the final selection, the orbital parallax of
18 of 20 stars is known to better than 5%. In the full sample, 148 objects

network are usually derived with the assumption of complete and exact knowledge
of network topology. We study the performance of three such algorithms (LPTVA,
GMLA and Pearson correlation algorithm) in scenarios that do not fulfill this
assumption by modifying the network prior to localization. This is done by
adding superfluous new links, hiding existing ones, or reattaching links in
accordance with the network's structural Hamiltonian. We find that GMLA is
highly resilient to the addition of superfluous edges, as its precision falls
by more than statistical uncertainty only when the number of links is
approximately doubled. On the other hand, if the edge set is underestimated or
reattachment has taken place, the performance of GMLA drops significantly. In
such a scenario the Pearson algorithm is preferable, retaining most of its
performance when other simulation parameters favor localization (high density
of observers, highly deterministic propagation). It is also generally more
accurate than LPTVA, as well as orders of magnitude faster. The aforementioned
differences between localization algorithms can be intuitively explained,
although a need for further theoretical research is noted.

through the solution of an optimal control problem where the motion of all

the algorithm in terms of performance and satisfaction of collision avoidance

Counterfactual queries often take the form of ""what if"" type questions such as
""would an applicant have been hired if they had over 10 years of experience,
when in reality they only had 5 years of experience?"" Such questions and
counterfactual inference in general are crucial, for example when addressing
the problem of fairness in decision-making. Because counterfactual events
contain contradictory states of the world, it is impossible to conduct a
randomized experiment to address them without making several restrictive
assumptions. However, it is sometimes possible to identify such queries from
observational and experimental data by representing the system under study as a
causal model, and the available data as symbolic probability distributions.
Shpitser and Pearl (2007) constructed two algorithms, called ID* and IDC*, for
identifying counterfactual queries and conditional counterfactual queries,
respectively. These two algorithms are analogous to the ID and IDC algorithms
by Shpitser and Pearl (2006) for identification of interventional

magnetic stars was discovered more than two decades ago, but the physical
conditions that make the generation of ECME favourable remain uncertain. Only
recently was an empirical relation, connecting ECME luminosity with the stellar
magnetic field and temperature, proposed to explain what makes a hot magnetic
star capable of producing ECME. This relation was, however, obtained with just
fourteen stars. Therefore, it is important to examine whether this relation is
robust. With the aim of testing the robustness, we conducted radio observations
of five hot magnetic stars. This led to the discovery of three more stars
producing ECME. We find that the proposed scaling relation remains valid after
the addition of the newly discovered stars. However we discovered that the
magnetic field and effective temperature correlate for $T_\mathrm{eff}\lesssim
16$ kK (likely an artifact of the small sample size), rendering the proposed
connection between ECME luminosity and $T_\mathrm{eff}$ unreliable. By
examining the empirical relation in light of the scaling law for incoherent
radio emission, we arrive at the conclusion that both types of emission are
powered by the same magnetospheric phenomenon. Like the incoherent emission,
coherent radio emission is indifferent to $T_\mathrm{eff}$ for late-B and
A-type stars, but $T_\mathrm{eff}$ appears to become important for early-B type
stars, possibly due to higher absorption, or, higher plasma density at the
emission sites suppressing the production of the emission.

novel 2-Phase framework to address the problem of class-imbalance by (1)
undersampling the head classes to remove redundant samples along with
maintaining the learned information through knowledge distillation, and (2)
oversampling the tail classes by performing visual-aware data augmentation. We
show the effectiveness of our method by comparing with existing
state-of-the-art long-tailed classification methods and show improved
performance on both Food101-LT and VFN-LT benchmarks. The results demonstrate
the potential to apply our method to related real life applications.

gains for the RSC code, suggesting that the method could be extended to turbo

defined over topological spaces (e.g., simplicial complexes) that are maximally
concentrated on the topological domain (e.g., over a set of nodes, edges,
triangles, etc.) and perfectly localized on the dual domain (e.g., a set of
frequencies). These signals are obtained as the principal eigenvectors of a
matrix built from proper localization operators acting over topology and
frequency domains. Then, we suggest a principled procedure to build
dictionaries of topological Slepians, which theoretically provide
non-degenerate frames. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
topological Slepian dictionary in two applications, i.e., sparse signal
representation and denoising of edge flows.

particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in cities around the world. One of
the most commonly deployed LCS is the PurpleAir with about 15,000 sensors
deployed in the United States. However, the change in sensor performance over
time has not been well studied. It is important to understand the lifespan of
these sensors to determine when they should be replaced, and when measurements
from these devices should or should not be used for various applications. This
paper fills in this gap by leveraging the fact that: 1) Each PurpleAir sensor
is comprised of two identical sensors and the divergence between their
measurements can be observed, and 2) There are numerous PurpleAir sensors
within 50 meters of regulatory monitors allowing for the comparison of
measurements between these two instruments. We propose empirically-derived
degradation outcomes for the PurpleAir sensors and evaluate how these outcomes
change over time. On average, we find that the number of 'flagged'
measurements, where the two sensors within each PurpleAir disagree, increases
in time to 4 percent after 4 years of operation. Approximately, 2 percent of
all PurpleAir sensors were permanently degraded. The largest fraction of
permanently degraded PurpleAir sensors appeared to be in the hot and humid
climate zone, suggesting that the sensors in this zone may need to be replaced
sooner. We also find that the bias of PurpleAir sensors, or the difference
between corrected PM2.5 levels and the corresponding reference measurements,
changed over time by -0.12 ug/m3 (95% CI: -0.13 ug/m3, -0.11 ug/m3) per year.
The average bias increases dramatically after 3.5 years. Climate zone is a
significant modifier of the association between degradation outcomes and time.

interstellar medium (ISM) induces a 3D spatial variation of the properties of
Galactic polarized emission. The observed signal results from the averaging of
different spectral energy distributions (SED) and polarization angles, along
and between lines of sight. As a consequence, the total Stokes parameters $Q$
and $U$ will have different distorted SEDs, so that the polarization angle
becomes frequency dependent. In the present work, we show how this phenomenon
similarly induces a different distorted SED for the three polarized angular
power spectra $EE$, $BB$ and $EB$, implying a variation of the $EE/BB$ ratio
with frequency. We demonstrate how the previously introduced spin-moment
formalism provides a natural framework to grasp these effects, allowing us to
derive analytical predictions for the spectral behaviors of the polarized
spectra, focusing here on the example of thermal dust polarized emission. After
a quantitative discussion based on a model combining emission from a filament
with its background, we further reveal that the spectral complexity implemented
in the dust models commonly used by the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
community produce such effects. This new understanding is crucial for CMB
component separation, in which an extreme accuracy is required in the modeling
of the dust signal to allow for the search of the primordial imprints of
inflation or cosmic birefringence. For the latter, as long as the dust $EB$
signal is not measured accurately, great caution is required about the
assumptions made to model its spectral behavior, as it may not simply follow
from the other dust angular power spectra.

($\text{M}^2$-FEM) that addresses several long-standing challenges in the
numerical simulation of integral structural theories, often used to model
multiscale and nonlocal effects. The major challenges in the numerical
simulation of integral boundary value problems are primarily rooted in the
coupling of the spatial discretization of the global (parent) and integral
(child) domains which severely restricts the computational efficiency of
existing algorithms by imposing an implicit trade-off in the accuracy achieved
by the child domain and in the resources dedicated to the simulation of the
overall parent domain. One of the most defining contributions of this study
consists in the development of a mesh-decoupling technique that generates
isolated sets of meshes such that the parent and child domains can be
discretized and approximated independently. This mesh-decoupling has a
multi-fold impact on the simulation of integral theories such that, when
compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed algorithm
achieves simultaneously better numerical accuracy and efficiency (hence
allowing a greater flexibility in both mesh size and computational cost
trade-off decisions), greater ability to adopt generalized integral kernel
functions, and the ability to handle non-regular (non-rectangular) domains via
unstructured meshing. In this study, we choose a benchmark problem based on an
extended version of the Eringen's nonlocal elasticity theory (implicitly, a
multiscale theory) that leverages the use of generalized attenuation kernels
and non-constant horizons of nonlocality. Nonetheless, the proposed
$\text{M}^2$-FEM algorithm is very general and it can be applied to a variety
of integral theories, even beyond structural elasticity.

We furthermore study the small-$N$ expansions of $Z(g,N)$ and $ W(g,N)$. For
any $g=|g| e^{\imath \varphi}$ on the sector of the Riemann surface with
$|\varphi|<3\pi/2$, the small-$N$ expansion of $Z(g,N)$ has infinite radius of

coefficients of these expansions, $Z_n(g)$ and $W_n(g)$, exhibit analytic
properties similar to $Z(g,N)$ and $W(g,N)$ and have transseries expansions.
The transseries expansion of $Z_n(g)$ is readily accessible: much like
$Z(g,N)$, for any $n$, $Z_n(g)$ has a zero- and a one-instanton contribution.
The transseries of $W_n(g)$ is obtained using M\""oebius inversion and summing

to the stripped-envelope supernova (SN) 2016adj located in the central
dust-lane of Centaurus A. Following point-spread function subtraction, we
identify the earliest LE emission associated with a SN at only $+$34 days (d)
past the epoch of $B$-band maximum. Additional HST images extending through
$+$578 d cover the evolution of LE1 taking the form of a ring, while images
taken on $+$1991 d reveals not only LE1, but also segments of a new inner LE
ring (LE2) as well as two additional outer LE rings (LE3 & LE4). Adopting the
single scattering formalism, the angular radii of the LEs suggest they
originate from discrete dust sheets in the foreground of the SN. This
information, combined with measurements of color and optical depth of the
scattering surfaces, informs a scenario with multiple sheets of clumpy dust
characterized by a varying degree of holes. In this case, the larger the LE's
angular radii, the further in the foreground of the SN its dust sheet is
located. However, an exception to this is LE2, which is formed by a dust sheet
located in closer proximity to the SN than the dust sheets producing LE1, LE3,
and LE4. The delayed appearance of LE2 can be attributed to its dust sheet
having a significant hole along the line-of-sight between the SN and Earth.

""Decoupled-Mixup"" method to train CNN models for OOD visual recognition.
Different from previous work combining pairs of images homogeneously, our

then heterogeneously combines these regions of image pairs to train CNN models.
Since the observation is that noise-prone regions such as textural and clutter

training, we enhance features from discriminative regions and suppress
noise-prone ones when combining an image pair. To further improve the
generalization ability of trained models, we propose to disentangle

prohibitively expensive, especially at high Reynolds numbers. As a remedy, we
may use multifidelity models (MFM) to construct predictive models for flow
quantities of interest (QoIs), with the purpose of uncertainty quantification,
data fusion and optimization. For numerical simulation of turbulence, there is
a hierarchy of methodologies ranked by accuracy and cost, which include several
numerical/modeling parameters that control the predictive accuracy and
robustness of the resulting outputs. Compatible with these specifications, the
present hierarchical MFM strategy allows for simultaneous calibration of the
fidelity-specific parameters in a Bayesian framework as developed by Goh et al.
2013. The purpose of the multifidelity model is to provide an improved
prediction by combining lower and higher fidelity data in an optimal way for
any number of fidelity levels; even providing confidence intervals for the
resulting QoI. The capabilities of our multifidelity model are first
demonstrated on an illustrative toy problem, and it is then applied to three
realistic cases relevant to engineering turbulent flows. The latter include the
prediction of friction at different Reynolds numbers in turbulent channel flow,
the prediction of aerodynamic coefficients for a range of angles of attack of a
standard airfoil, and the uncertainty propagation and sensitivity analysis of
the separation bubble in the turbulent flow over periodic hills subject to the
geometrical uncertainties. In all cases, based on only a few high-fidelity data
samples (typically direct numerical simulations, DNS), the multifidelity model
leads to accurate predictions of the QoIs accompanied with an estimate of
confidence. The result of the UQ and sensitivity analyses are also found to be
accurate compared to the ground truth in each case.

model and often lets those tasks learn better jointly. However, when deploying
MTL onto those real-world systems that are often resource-constrained or
latency-sensitive, two prominent challenges arise: (i) during training,
simultaneously optimizing all tasks is often difficult due to gradient
conflicts across tasks; (ii) at inference, current MTL regimes have to activate
nearly the entire model even to just execute a single task. Yet most real
systems demand only one or two tasks at each moment, and switch between tasks
as needed: therefore such all tasks activated inference is also highly
inefficient and non-scalable. In this paper, we present a model-accelerator
co-design framework to enable efficient on-device MTL. Our framework, dubbed
M$^3$ViT, customizes mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers into a vision transformer
(ViT) backbone for MTL, and sparsely activates task-specific experts during
training. Then at inference with any task of interest, the same design allows
for activating only the task-corresponding sparse expert pathway, instead of
the full model. Our new model design is further enhanced by hardware-level
innovations, in particular, a novel computation reordering scheme tailored for
memory-constrained MTL that achieves zero-overhead switching between tasks and
can scale to any number of experts. When executing single-task inference,
M$^{3}$ViT achieves higher accuracies than encoder-focused MTL methods, while
significantly reducing 88% inference FLOPs. When implemented on a hardware

attractive. First, the deployment of the sensing node on the being tracked body
part is not a requirement for HBC sensing approach. Second, HBC is sensitive to
the body's interaction with its surroundings, including both touching and being
in the immediate proximity of people and objects. We first described the
sensing principle for HBC, sensor architecture and implementation, and methods
for evaluation. We then presented two case studies demonstrating the usefulness
of HBC as a complement/alternative to IMUs. First, we explored the exercise
recognition and repetition counting of seven machine-free leg-only exercises
and eleven general gym workouts with the signal source of HBC and IMU. The HBC
sensing shows significant advantages over the IMU signals in
classification(0.89 vs 0.78 in F-score) and counting(0.982 vs 0.938 in
accuracy) of the leg-only exercises. For the general gym workouts, HBC only
shows recognition improvement for certain workouts like adductor where legs
alone complete the movement. And it also supplies better results over the IMU
for workouts counting(0.800 vs. 0.756 when wearing the sensors on the wrist).
In the second case, we tried to recognize actions related to manipulating
objects and physical collaboration between users by using a wrist-worn HBC
sensing unit. We detected collaboration between the users with 0.69 F-score
when receiving data from a single user and 0.78 when receiving data from both

activities with an F-score over a single wrist accelerometer approach by 16\%.

learning from multiple tasks. The existing works in the literature often assume
multi-task learning as a sensible performance upper bound for various continual
learning algorithms. While this assumption is empirically verified for
different continual learning benchmarks, it is not rigorously justified.
Moreover, it is imaginable that when learning from multiple tasks, a small
subset of these tasks could behave as adversarial tasks reducing the overall
learning performance in a multi-task setting. In contrast, continual learning
approaches can avoid the performance drop caused by such adversarial tasks to
preserve their performance on the rest of the tasks, leading to better
performance than a multi-task learner. This paper proposes a novel continual
self-supervised learning setting, where each task corresponds to learning an
invariant representation for a specific class of data augmentations. In this
setting, we show that continual learning often beats multi-task learning on
various benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

for the anatomical coherence of the results, neither provide feedback on the

deep learning method for automated BM segmentation in AMD patients. An
Attention U-Net is trained to output a probability density function of the BM
position, while taking into account the natural curvature of the surface.
Besides the surface position, the method also estimates an A-scan wise
uncertainty measure of the segmentation output. Subsequently, the A-scans with
high uncertainty are interpolated using thin plate splines (TPS). We tested our
method with ablation studies on an internal dataset with 138 patients covering
all three AMD stages, and achieved a mean absolute localization error of 4.10
um. In addition, the proposed segmentation method was compared against the

this work, we show that such a mode is also found in zero density holographic
quantum critical states. We demonstrate that in these states, the appearance of
a zero temperature sound mode is the consequence of a mixed `t Hooft anomaly
between the global U(1) symmetry and an emergent higher-form symmetry. At
non-zero temperatures, the presence of a black hole horizon weakly breaks the
emergent symmetry and gaps the collective mode, giving rise to a sharp
Drude-like peak in the electric conductivity. A similar gapped mode arises at
low temperatures for non-zero densities when the state has an emergent Lorentz
symmetry, also originating from an approximate anomalous higher-form symmetry.
However, in this case the collective excitation does not survive at zero

studies of magnetically-driven steady-state jets from Keplerian accretion
disks. In particular, the latter have predicted the existence of recollimation
shocks due to the dominant hoop-stress, so far never observed in platform
simulations.
  Methods. We perform a set of axisymmetric MHD simulations of non-relativistic
jets using the PLUTO code. The simulations are designed to reproduce the
boundary conditions generally expected in analytical studies. We vary two
parameters: the magnetic flux radial exponent $\alpha$ and the jet mass load
$\kappa$. In order to reach the huge unprecedented spatial scales implied by
the analytical solutions, a new method allowing to boost the temporal evolution
has been used.
  Results. We confirm the existence of standing recollimation shocks at large
distances, behaving qualitatively with the mass load $\kappa$ as in
self-similar studies. The shocks are weak and correspond to oblique shocks in a
moderately high fast-magnetosonic flow. The jet emitted from the disk is
focused towards the axial inner spine, which is the outflow connected to the
central objet. The presence of this spine is shown to have a strong influence
on jet asymptotics.
  Conclusions. Internal recollimation shocks may produce observable features
such as standing knots of enhanced emission and a decrease of the flow rotation
rate. However, more realistic simulations, e.g. fully three-dimensional, must
be done in order to investigate non-axisymmetric instabilities and with
ejection only from a finite zone in the disk, so as to to verify whether these
MHD recollimation shocks and their properties are maintained.

real-world sequential decision making problems. In this paper, we propose a
simple and computationally efficient sparse linear estimation method called
PopArt that enjoys a tighter $\ell_1$ recovery guarantee compared to Lasso

experimental design criterion that is convex and thus computationally efficient
to solve. Based on our novel estimator and design criterion, we derive sparse
linear bandit algorithms that enjoy improved regret upper bounds upon the state
of the art (Hao et al., 2020), especially w.r.t. the geometry of the given
action set. Finally, we prove a matching lower bound for sparse linear bandits
in the data-poor regime, which closes the gap between upper and lower bounds in
prior work.

long-term stabilities for the acceleration and the rotation rate at 0.13 $\mu$g

results in detecting never-before-seen malware executables without relying on

meticulously modified, functionality-preserving versions of original malware
executables generated by machine learning. Due to the nature of these
adversarial modifications, these adversarial methods often use a \textit{single
view} of malware executables (i.e., the binary/hexadecimal view) to generate
adversarial malware variants. This provides an opportunity for the defenders
(i.e., malware detectors) to detect the adversarial variants by utilizing more
than one view of a malware file (e.g., source code view in addition to the

focuses on the binary view, certain characteristics of the malware file in the

suitable for NISQ devices, and allows one to outperform classical computers,
Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) were designed. Our subject of interest is
the so-called Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm and was
originally designed to simulate electronic structures and to compute the ground
state of a given molecule.
  VQE is made of two main components : an ansatz and a classical optimizer. The
ansatz runs on the quantum device and aims to simulate the wavefunction, the
parameters of the ansatz will be optimized until the expectation value is
minimum.
  The very first ansatz that has originally been used is called UCCSD and it is
based on Coupled Cluster Theory. The main issue considering UCCSD is the large
amount of parameters to optimize and this leads us to the introduction of
Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter ansatz VQE (ADAPT-VQE) which
determines a quasi-optimal ansatz with a minimal number of parameters.
  The key point of ADAPT-VQE is to grow the ansatz at every step, by adding
operators chosen from a pre-determined pool of operators one-at-a-time,
assuring that the maximal amount of correlation energy is recovered at each
step. There exists different kind of ADAPT-VQE depending on the starting pool
of operators as the fermionic-ADAPT, the qubit-ADAPT or even the qubit
excitation based (QEB).
  Our goal is to implement the different types of ADAPT-VQE mentioned before.
After a quick review of the theoretical background under all of these concepts,
we will implement each algorithm using quiskit. We will also compare all of
these algorithms on different criterions such as the number of parameters, the
accuracy or the number of CNOT gate used on H2 and LiH molecules. Then we will
have a small discussion about the results we obtained.

the process of RDF knowledge graph creation traceable and transparent;
extending and applying declarative mapping languages is an example. One
challenging step is the traceability of procedures that aim to overcome
interoperability issues, a.k.a. data-level integration. In most pipelines, data
integration is performed by ad-hoc programs, preventing traceability and
reusability. However, formal frameworks provided by function-based declarative
mapping languages such as FunUL and RML+FnO empower expressiveness. Data-level
integration can be defined as functions and integrated as part of the mappings
performing schema-level integration. However, combining functions with the
mappings introduces a new source of complexity that can considerably impact the
required number of resources and execution time. We tackle the problem of
efficiently executing mappings with functions and formalize the transformation
of them into function-free mappings. These transformations are the basis of an
optimization process that aims to perform an eager evaluation of function-based
mapping rules. These techniques are implemented in a framework named Dragoman.
We demonstrate the correctness of the transformations while ensuring that the
function-free data integration processes are equivalent to the original one.
The effectiveness of Dragoman is empirically evaluated in 230 testbeds composed
of various types of functions integrated with mapping rules of different
complexity. The outcomes suggest that evaluating function-free mapping rules
reduces execution time in complex knowledge graph creation pipelines composed
of large data sources and multiple types of mapping rules. The savings can be
up to 75%, suggesting that eagerly executing functions in mapping rules enable
making these pipelines applicable and scalable in real-world settings.

extended by adding a data-driven, physics-constrained machine learning approach

  Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing",,"10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3217485",,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Heterogeneous data fusion can enhance the robustness and accuracy of an
algorithm on a given task. However, due to the difference in various
modalities, aligning the sensors and embedding their information into
discriminative and compact representations is challenging. In this paper, we
propose a Contrastive learning based MultiModal Alignment Network (CoMMANet) to
align data from different sensors into a shared and discriminative manifold
where class information is preserved. The proposed architecture uses a
multimodal triplet autoencoder to cluster the latent space in such a way that
samples of the same classes from each heterogeneous modality are mapped close
to each other. Since all the modalities exist in a shared manifold, a unified
classification framework is proposed. The resulting latent space
representations are fused to perform more robust and accurate classification.
In a missing sensor scenario, the latent space of one sensor is easily and
efficiently predicted using another sensor's latent space, thereby allowing
sensor translation. We conducted extensive experiments on a manually labeled
multimodal dataset containing hyperspectral data from AVIRIS-NG and NEON, and
LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data from NEON. Lastly, the model is
validated on two benchmark datasets: Berlin Dataset (hyperspectral and
synthetic aperture radar) and MUUFL Gulfport Dataset (hyperspectral and LiDAR).
A comparison made with other methods demonstrates the superiority of this
method. We achieved a mean overall accuracy of 94.3% on the MUUFL dataset and
the best overall accuracy of 71.26% on the Berlin dataset, which is better than
other state-of-the-art approaches.

integrating Deep RL and EA to devise new methods by fusing their complementary
advantages. However, existing works on combining Deep RL and EA have two common
drawbacks: 1) the RL agent and EA agents learn their policies individually,
neglecting efficient sharing of useful common knowledge; 2) parameter-level
policy optimization guarantees no semantic level of behavior evolution for the
EA side. In this paper, we propose Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with
Two-scale State Representation and Policy Representation (ERL-Re2), a novel
solution to the aforementioned two drawbacks. The key idea of ERL-Re2 is
two-scale representation: all EA and RL policies share the same nonlinear state
representation while maintaining individual linear policy representations. The
state representation conveys expressive common features of the environment
learned by all the agents collectively; the linear policy representation
provides a favorable space for efficient policy optimization, where novel
behavior-level crossover and mutation operations can be performed. Moreover,
the linear policy representation allows convenient generalization of policy
fitness with the help of Policy-extended Value Function Approximator (PeVFA),
further improving the sample efficiency of fitness estimation. The experiments
on a range of continuous control tasks show that ERL-Re2 consistently
outperforms strong baselines and achieves significant improvement over both its

test and ensure the safety of the autonomous driving systems, consisting of
multiple layers intertwined in a complicated way. However, while
safety-critical bugs may exist in any layer and even across layers, relatively

  In this paper, we aim at holistic testing of autonomous driving systems that

into the individual layers, we focus on the vehicle states that the system
continuously changes in the driving environment. This allows us to design
DriveFuzz, a new systematic fuzzing framework that can uncover potential

generates and mutates driving scenarios based on diverse factors leveraging a
high-fidelity driving simulator. We build novel driving test oracles based on
the real-world traffic rules to detect safety-critical misbehaviors, and guide
the fuzzer towards such misbehaviors through driving quality metrics referring
to the physical states of the vehicle.
  DriveFuzz has discovered 30 new bugs in various layers of two autonomous

in brain-computer interfaces. Existing emotion decoding methods still have two
main limitations: one is only decoding a single emotion category from a brain
activity pattern and the decoded emotion categories are coarse-grained, which
is inconsistent with the complex emotional expression of human; the other is
ignoring the discrepancy of emotion expression between the left and right
hemispheres of human brain. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view
multi-label hybrid model for fine-grained emotion decoding (up to 80 emotion
categories) which can learn the expressive neural representations and
predicting multiple emotional states simultaneously. Specifically, the
generative component of our hybrid model is parametrized by a multi-view
variational auto-encoder, in which we regard the brain activity of left and
right hemispheres and their difference as three distinct views, and use the
product of expert mechanism in its inference network. The discriminative
component of our hybrid model is implemented by a multi-label classification
network with an asymmetric focal loss. For more accurate emotion decoding, we
first adopt a label-aware module for emotion-specific neural representations
learning and then model the dependency of emotional states by a masked
self-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on two visually evoked

potentials, namely, the Helmholtz free energy and the dissipation potential,
which completely define the behavior of generalized standard materials. The a
priori enforced constraint of convexity on these potentials guarantees by
construction stability and thermodynamic consistency of the discovered model;
balance of linear momentum acts as a fundamental constraint to replace the
availability of stress-strain labeled pairs; sparsity promoting regularization
enables the automatic selection of a small subset from a possibly large number
of candidate model features and thus leads to a parsimonious, i.e., simple and
interpretable, model. Importantly, since model features go hand in hand with
the correspondingly active internal variables, sparse regression automatically
induces a parsimonious selection of the few internal variables needed for an
accurate but simple description of the material behavior. A fully automatic
procedure leads to the selection of the hyperparameter controlling the weight
of the sparsity promoting regularization term, in order to strike a
user-defined balance between model accuracy and simplicity. By testing the
method on synthetic data including artificial noise, we demonstrate that EUCLID
is able to automatically discover the true hidden material model from a large
catalog of constitutive classes, including elasticity, viscoelasticity,
elastoplasticity, viscoplasticity, isotropic and kinematic hardening.

the original model parameters) to fine-tuning, known as prefix tuning has been
introduced. This method freezes the model parameters and only updates the
prefix to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning. Prefix tuning
enables researchers and financial practitioners to achieve similar results with
much fewer parameters. In this paper, we explore the robustness of prefix
tuning when facing noisy data. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning is
more robust to noise than prefix tuning -- the latter method faces a
significant decrease in performance on most corrupted data sets with increasing
noise levels. Furthermore, prefix tuning has high variances in the F1 scores
compared to fine-tuning in many corruption methods. We strongly advocate that
caution should be carefully taken when applying the state-of-the-art prefix
tuning method to noisy data.

Submitted to ICASSP 2023",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multimodal emotion recognition has attracted much attention recently. Fusing
multiple modalities effectively with limited labeled data is a challenging
task. Considering the success of pre-trained model and fine-grained nature of
emotion expression, it is reasonable to take these two aspects into
consideration. Unlike previous methods that mainly focus on one aspect, we
introduce a novel multi-granularity framework, which combines fine-grained
representation with pre-trained utterance-level representation. Inspired by
Transformer TTS, we propose a multilevel transformer model to perform
fine-grained multimodal emotion recognition. Specifically, we explore different
methods to incorporate phoneme-level embedding with word-level embedding. To
perform multi-granularity learning, we simply combine multilevel transformer
model with Albert. Extensive experimental results show that both our multilevel
transformer model and multi-granularity model outperform previous
state-of-the-art approaches on IEMOCAP dataset with text transcripts and speech
signal.

this topic. ALF providesprepared software components that can be used to deploy
an activelearning loop and maintain an ALF instance that continuouslyevolves a

tradeoff between the power availability of a tethered UAV (TUAV) and the
flexibility of an untethered UAV. An iTUAV can provide cellular connectivity
while being temporarily tethered to the most adequate ground anchor. Also, it
can flexibly detach from one anchor, travel, then attach to another one to
maintain/improve the coverage quality for mobile users. Hence, we discuss here
the existing UAV-based cellular networking technologies, followed by a detailed
description of the iTUAV system, its components, and mode of operation.
Subsequently, we present a comparative study of the existing and proposed
systems highlighting the differences in key features such as mobility and
energy. To emphasize the potential of iTUAV systems, we conduct a case study,
evaluate the iTUAV performance, and compare it to benchmarks. Obtained results
show that with only 10 anchors in the area, the iTUAV system can serve up to
90% of the users covered by the untethered UAV swapping system. Moreover,
results from a small case study prove that the iTUAV allows to balance
performance/cost and can be implemented realistically. For instance, when user
locations are clustered, with only 2 active iTUAVs and 4 anchors, achieved
performance is superior to that of the system with 3 TUAVs, while when
considering a single UAV on a 100 minutes event, a system with only 6 anchors
outperforms the untethered UAV as it combines location flexibility with
increased mission time.

  Co-design",,,,,"q-bio.BM cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Antibodies are versatile proteins that can bind to pathogens and provide
effective protection for human body. Recently, deep learning-based
computational antibody design has attracted popular attention since it
automatically mines the antibody patterns from data that could be complementary
to human experiences. However, the computational methods heavily rely on
high-quality antibody structure data, which is quite limited. Besides, the
complementarity-determining region (CDR), which is the key component of an
antibody that determines the specificity and binding affinity, is highly
variable and hard to predict. Therefore, the data limitation issue further
raises the difficulty of CDR generation for antibodies. Fortunately, there
exists a large amount of sequence data of antibodies that can help model the
CDR and alleviate the reliance on structure data. By witnessing the success of
pre-training models for protein modeling, in this paper, we develop the
antibody pre-training language model and incorporate it into the
(antigen-specific) antibody design model in a systemic way. Specifically, we
first pre-train an antibody language model based on the sequence data, then
propose a one-shot way for sequence and structure generation of CDR to avoid
the heavy cost and error propagation from an autoregressive manner, and finally
leverage the pre-trained antibody model for the antigen-specific antibody
generation model with some carefully designed modules. Through various
experiments, we show that our method achieves superior performances over
previous baselines on different tasks, such as sequence and structure
generation and antigen-binding CDR-H3 design.

sales. I find that reduction of the federal subsidy caused sales to decline by
$43.2 \%$. To arrive at this result, I employ historical time series data from
the Department of Energy Alternative Fuels Data Center. Using the fact that the
subsidy is available only for firms with fewer than 200,000 cumulative EV
sales, I separate EV models into two groups. The treatment group consists of
models receiving the full subsidy, and the control group consists of models
receiving the reduced subsidy. This allows for a difference in differences
(DiD) model structure. To examine the robustness of the results, I conduct
regression analyses. Due to a relatively small sample size, the regression
coefficients lack statistical significance. Above all, my results suggest that
federal incentives designed to promote EV consumption are successful in their
objectives.
