created in lead-lead collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of
$\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV is studied by determining the azimuthal
anisotropies for dijets with high transverse momentum. The data were collected
by the CMS experiment in 2018 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.6
9 nb$^{-1}$. For events containing back-to-back jets, correlations in relative
azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity ($\eta$) between jets and hadrons, and
between two hadrons, are constructed. The anisotropies are expressed as the
Fourier expansion coefficients $v_n$, $n = $ 2-4 of these azimuthal
distributions. The dijet $v_n$ values are extracted from long-range (1.5 $\lt
\vert\Delta\eta\vert \lt$ 2.5) components of these correlations, which
suppresses the background contributions from jet fragmentation processes.
Positive dijet $v_2$ values are observed which increase from central to more
peripheral events, while the $v_3$ and $v_4$ values are consistent with zero
within experimental uncertainties.

studies and propose a new framework of robust causal inference with unobserved
confounders. Our approach is based on distributionally robust optimization and
proceeds in two steps. We first specify the maximal degree to which the
distribution of unobserved potential outcomes may deviate from that of observed
outcomes. We then derive sharp bounds on the average treatment effects under
this assumption. Our framework encompasses the popular marginal sensitivity
model as a special case, and we demonstrate how the proposed methodology can
address a primary challenge of the marginal sensitivity model that it produces
uninformative results when unobserved confounders substantially affect
treatment and outcome. Specifically, we develop an alternative sensitivity
model, called the distributional sensitivity model, under the assumption that
heterogeneity of treatment effect due to unobserved variables is relatively
small. Unlike the marginal sensitivity model, the distributional sensitivity
model allows for potential lack of overlap and often produces informative
bounds even when unobserved variables substantially affect both treatment and
outcome. Finally, we show how to extend the distributional sensitivity model to
difference-in-differences designs and settings with instrumental variables.
Through simulation and empirical studies, we demonstrate the applicability of
the proposed methodology.

a circulant matrix of nullity one such that its non-zero null space vectors
have no zero elements. The study of circulant nut graphs was originally
initiated by Ba\v{s}i\'c et al. [Art Discrete Appl. Math. 5(2) (2021) #P2.01],
where a conjecture was made regarding the existence of all the possible pairs
$(n, d)$ for which there exists a $d$-regular circulant nut graph of order $n$.
Later on, it was proved by Damnjanovi\'c and Stevanovi\'c [Linear Algebra Appl.
633 (2022) 127-151] that for each odd $t \ge 3$ such that $t\not\equiv_{10}1$
and $t\not\equiv_{18}15$, the $4t$-regular circulant graph of order $n$ with
the generator set $\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 2t+1 \} \setminus \{t\})$ must
necessarily be a nut graph for each even $n \ge 4t + 4$. In this paper, we
extend these results by constructing two families of circulant nut graphs. The
first family comprises the $4t$-regular circulant graphs of order $n$ which
correspond to the generator sets $\{1, 2, \ldots, t-1\} \cup
\left\{\frac{n}{4}, \frac{n}{4} + 1 \right\} \cup \left\{\frac{n}{2} - (t-1),
\ldots, \frac{n}{2} - 2, \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right\}$, for each odd $t \in
\mathbb{N}$ and $n \ge 4t + 4$ divisible by four. The second family consists of
the $4t$-regular circulant graphs of order $n$ which correspond to the
generator sets $\{1, 2, \ldots, t-1\} \cup \left\{\frac{n+2}{4}, \frac{n+6}{4}
\right\} \cup \left\{\frac{n}{2} - (t-1), \ldots, \frac{n}{2} - 2,
\frac{n}{2}-1 \right\}$, for each $t \in \mathbb{N}$ and $n \ge 4t + 6$ such
that $n \equiv_{4} 2$. We prove that all of the graphs which belong to these
families are indeed nut graphs, thereby fully resolving the $4t$-regular
circulant nut graph order-degree existence problem whenever $t$ is odd and
partially solving this problem for even values of $t$ as well.

that enhances the spectral efficiency of communication links, and is being
investigated for 5G standards and beyond. A major drawback of NOMA is the need
to apply successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver on a
symbol-by-symbol basis, which limits its practicality. To circumvent this, in
this paper a novel constructive multiple access (CoMA) scheme is proposed and
investigated. CoMA aligns the superimposed signals to the different users
constructively to the signal of interest. Since the superimposed signal aligns
with the data signal, there is no need to remove it at the receiver using SIC.
Accordingly, SIC component can be removed at the receiver side. In this regard
and in order to provide a comprehensive investigation and comparison, different
optimization problems for user paring NOMA multiple-input-single-output (MISO)
systems are considered. Firstly, an optimal precoder to minimize the total
transmission power for CoMA subject to a quality-of-service constraint is
obtained, and compared to conventional NOMA. Then, a precoder that minimizes
the CoMA symbol error rate (SER) subject to power constraint is investigated.
Further, the computational complexity of CoMA is considered and compared with
conventional NOMA scheme in terms of total number of complex operations. The
results in this paper prove the superiority of the proposed CoMA scheme over
the conventional NOMA technique, and demonstrate that CoMA is an attractive
solution for user paring NOMA MISO systems with low number of BS antennas,
while circumventing the receive SIC complexity.

attention. Previous prototype-based explainable networks involved prototype
activation in both reasoning and interpretation processes, requiring specific
explainable structures for the prototype, thus making the network less accurate
as it gains interpretability. Therefore, the decoupling prototypical network
(DProtoNet) was proposed to avoid this problem. This new model contains
encoder, inference, and interpretation modules. As regards the encoder module,
unrestricted feature masks were presented to generate expressive features and
prototypes. Regarding the inference module, a multi-image prototype learning
method was introduced to update prototypes so that the network can learn
generalized prototypes. Finally, concerning the interpretation module, a
multiple dynamic masks (MDM) decoder was suggested to explain the neural
network, which generates heatmaps using the consistent activation of the
original image and mask image at the detection nodes of the network. It
decouples the inference and interpretation modules of a prototype-based network
by avoiding the use of prototype activation to explain the network's decisions
in order to simultaneously improve the accuracy and interpretability of the
neural network. The multiple public general and medical datasets were tested,
and the results confirmed that our method could achieve a 5% improvement in

create a negative impact on average population outcomes such as engagement

path-dependent processes continues to be a complex challenge in computational
solid mechanics. Challenges arise both in considering the appropriate model
assumptions and from the viewpoint of data availability, verification, and
validation. Recently, data-driven modeling approaches have been proposed that
aim to establish stress-evolution laws that avoid user-chosen functional forms
by relying on machine learning representations and algorithms. However, these
approaches not only require a significant amount of data but also need data
that probes the full stress space with a variety of complex loading paths.
Furthermore, they rarely enforce all necessary thermodynamic principles as hard
constraints. Hence, they are in particular not suitable for low-data or
limited-data regimes, where the first arises from the cost of obtaining the
data and the latter from the experimental limitations of obtaining labeled
data, which is commonly the case in engineering applications. In this work, we
discuss a hybrid framework that can work on a variable amount of data by
relying on the modularity of the elastoplasticity formulation where each
component of the model can be chosen to be either a classical phenomenological
or a data-driven model depending on the amount of available information and the
complexity of the response. The method is tested on synthetic uniaxial data
coming from simulations as well as cyclic experimental data for structural
materials. The discovered material models are found to not only interpolate
well but also allow for accurate extrapolation in a thermodynamically
consistent manner far outside the domain of the training data. Training aspects
and details of the implementation of these models into Finite Element
simulations are discussed and analyzed.

promising paradigm for self-supervised learning (SSL) and achieve

despite its impressive empirical success, there is still limited theoretical
understanding of it. In this paper, we propose a theoretical understanding of
how masking matters for MAE to learn meaningful features. We establish a close
connection between MAE and contrastive learning, which shows that MAE implicit
aligns the mask-induced positive pairs. Built upon this connection, we develop
the first downstream guarantees for MAE methods, and analyze the effect of mask
ratio. Besides, as a result of the implicit alignment, we also point out the
dimensional collapse issue of MAE, and propose a Uniformity-enhanced MAE
(U-MAE) loss that can effectively address this issue and bring significant
improvements on real-world datasets, including CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and

choosing the compositions of data augmentation techniques and the corresponding
hyperparameter settings. We propose an augmentation-free graph contrastive
learning method, invariant-discriminative graph contrastive learning (iGCL),
that does not intrinsically require negative samples. iGCL designs the
invariant-discriminative loss (ID loss) to learn invariant and discriminative
representations. On the one hand, ID loss learns invariant signals by directly
minimizing the mean square error between the target samples and positive
samples in the representation space. On the other hand, ID loss ensures that
the representations are discriminative by an orthonormal constraint forcing the
different dimensions of representations to be independent of each other. This
prevents representations from collapsing to a point or subspace. Our
theoretical analysis explains the effectiveness of ID loss from the
perspectives of the redundancy reduction criterion, canonical correlation
analysis, and information bottleneck principle. The experimental results
demonstrate that iGCL outperforms all baselines on 5 node classification

  efficiency table (table 4). 3. Share codes and data",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many environmental applications, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
often used to model physical variables with long temporal dependencies.
However, due to mini-batch training, temporal relationships between training
segments within the batch (intra-batch) as well as between batches
(inter-batch) are not considered, which can lead to limited performance.
Stateful RNNs aim to address this issue by passing hidden states between
batches. Since Stateful RNNs ignore intra-batch temporal dependency, there
exists a trade-off between training stability and capturing temporal
dependency. In this paper, we provide a quantitative comparison of different
Stateful RNN modeling strategies, and propose two strategies to enforce both
intra- and inter-batch temporal dependency. First, we extend Stateful RNNs by
defining a batch as a temporally ordered set of training segments, which
enables intra-batch sharing of temporal information. While this approach
significantly improves the performance, it leads to much larger training times
due to highly sequential training. To address this issue, we further propose a
new strategy which augments a training segment with an initial value of the
target variable from the timestep right before the starting of the training
segment. In other words, we provide an initial value of the target variable as
additional input so that the network can focus on learning changes relative to
that initial value. By using this strategy, samples can be passed in any order
(mini-batch training) which significantly reduces the training time while
maintaining the performance. In demonstrating our approach in hydrological
modeling, we observe that the most significant gains in predictive accuracy
occur when these methods are applied to state variables whose values change
more slowly, such as soil water and snowpack, rather than continuously moving
flux variables such as streamflow.

impact of climate uncertainty in energy system planning. Addressing this
ideally requires high-resolution time series spanning at least a few decades.
However, solving capacity expansion planning models across such datasets often
requires too much computing time or memory. To reduce computational cost, users
often employ time series aggregation to compress demand and weather time series
into a smaller number of time steps. Methods are usually a priori, employing
information about the input time series only. Recent studies highlight the
limitations of this approach, since reducing statistical error metrics on input
time series does not in general lead to more accurate model outputs.
Furthermore, many aggregation schemes are unsuitable for models with storage
since they distort chronology. In this paper, we introduce a posteriori time
series aggregation schemes for models with storage. Our methods adapt to the
underlying energy system model; aggregation may differ in systems with
different technologies or topologies even with the same time series inputs.
Furthermore, they preserve chronology and hence allow modelling of storage
technologies. We investigate a number of approaches. We find that a posteriori
methods can perform better than a priori ones, primarily through a systematic
identification and preservation of relevant extreme events. We hope that these
tools render long demand and weather time series more manageable in capacity
expansion planning studies. We make our models, data, and code publicly

cost function and simultaneously determine the optimal track by varying
steering and breaking amplitudes. The current velocity of the vehicle is
limited to a maximal velocity, thus, allowing a stable search of the optimal
track. The parametric definition of obstacles generates a flexible environment
for low and high speed simulations. The minimal number of influential
optimization variables guarantees a stable and direct generation of optimal
results. By the current new approach to control a vehicle on an optimal track,
we are able to autonomously move the vehicle on an arbitrary track approximated
by low order polynomials. The optimization approach is also able to deal with a
variety of different obstacles and the corresponding optimal smooth obstacle
path. The computations demonstrate the effective control of a four wheel

continuously differentiable obstacle avoidance tracks. Simulation tests are

control the slip angle. The results shows that the cost function reached a
considerably high average convergence-to-zero rate success in most of the

spectral features and acceleration processes. We study two stages of
acceleration: energization up until the injection energy $\gamma_{\rm inj}$ and
further acceleration that generates a power-law spectrum. Stronger guide fields
increase the power-law index and $\gamma_{\rm inj}$, which suppresses
acceleration efficiency. These quantities seemingly converge with increasing
domain size, suggesting that our findings can be extended to large-scale
systems. We find that three distinct mechanisms contribute to acceleration
during injection: particle streaming along the parallel electric field, Fermi
reflection, and the pickup process. Fermi and pickup processes, related to the
electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field, govern the injection for
weak guide fields and larger domains. Meanwhile, parallel electric fields are
important for injection in the strong guide field regime. In the post-injection
stage, we find that perpendicular electric fields dominate particle
acceleration in the weak guide field regime, whereas parallel electric fields
control acceleration for strong guide fields. These findings will help explain
the nonthermal acceleration and emissions in high-energy astrophysics,

three objectives to align representation learning with expert knowledge, model
ideological stance consistency, and simulate the echo chamber phenomenon.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAR is better at augmenting political

that PAR learns representations that reflect the political reality and provide

To address this, we propose a rigorous technique to select subsets of data
points that when augmented, closely capture the training dynamics of full data
augmentation. We first show that data augmentation, modeled as additive
perturbations, improves learning and generalization by relatively enlarging and
perturbing the smaller singular values of the network Jacobian, while
preserving its prominent directions. This prevents overfitting and enhances
learning the harder to learn information. Then, we propose a framework to
iteratively extract small subsets of training data that when augmented, closely
capture the alignment of the fully augmented Jacobian with labels/residuals. We
prove that stochastic gradient descent applied to the augmented subsets found
by our approach has similar training dynamics to that of fully augmented data.

predicts the mean and the standard deviation and is well-calibrated. We use

theory and practice. This paper tackles this gap by providing the first
near-optimal label complexity guarantees for deep active learning. The key
insight is to study deep active learning from the nonparametric classification

with neural networks can provably achieve the minimax label complexity, up to
disagreement coefficient and other logarithmic terms. When equipped with an
abstention option, we further develop an efficient deep active learning

we develop algorithms for federated learning with lower communication costs.
However, such random sketching does not protect the privacy of local data

the sketching technique by presenting a specific gradient attack method. As a
remedy, we prove rigorously that the algorithm will be differentially private

the long-tail literature focus on class-imbalanced classification problems with
known imbalanced label counts per class, but they are not directly applicable
to the intra-class long-tail examples in problems with large intra-class
variations such as 3D object detection, where instances with the same class

difficulty, is the key to data-centric improvements for 3D detectors, since
rareness is the result of a lack in data support while difficulty is related to

imposes huge communication overhead. Although CP solves this problem, it has
limitations on the number of sub-models. In addition, both solutions are fault
intolerant, an issue when deployed on edge devices. We propose variant
parallelism (VP), an ensemble-based deep learning distribution method where
different variants of a main model are generated and can be deployed on
separate machines. We design a family of lighter models around the original
model, and train them simultaneously to improve accuracy over single models.
Our experimental results on six common mid-sized object recognition datasets
demonstrate that our models can have 5.8-7.1x fewer parameters, 4.3-31x fewer

Specifically, we explore the disorder-induced delocalized-to-localized

available quantum computers. In two dimensions, the compression scheme is no
longer applicable, thereby requiring the use of large-scale classical state

simulating interacting bosons via emulation of a noisy quantum computer allowed
us to study the effect of quantum hardware noise on the physical properties of
the simulated system. Our results suggest that scaling laws control how noise
modifies observables versus its strength, the circuit depth, and the number of
qubits. Moreover, we observe that noise impacts the delocalized and localized
phases differently. A better understanding of how noise alters the genuine
properties of the simulated system is essential for leveraging noisy
intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulation of dirty bosons, and indeed

Semantic Video Moments Retrieval at scale (SVMR), which aims at finding
relevant videos coupled with re-localizing the video clips in them. Instead of
a simple combination of video retrieval and video re-localization, our task is
more challenging because of several essential aspects. In the 1st stage, our
SVMR should take into account the fact that: 1) a positive candidate long video
can contain plenty of irrelevant clips which are also semantically meaningful.
2) a long video can be positive to two totally different query clips if it
contains clips relevant to two queries. The 2nd re-localization stage also
exhibits different assumptions from existing video re-localization tasks, which
hold an assumption that the reference video must contain semantically similar
segments corresponding to the query clip. Instead, in our scenario, the
retrieved long video can be a false positive one due to the inaccuracy of the
first stage. To address these challenges, we propose our two-stage baseline
solution of candidate videos retrieval followed by a novel attention-based
query-reference semantically alignment framework to re-localize target clips
from candidate videos. Furthermore, we build two more appropriate benchmark
datasets from the off-the-shelf ActivityNet-1.3 and HACS for a thorough

matter assembly derives almost exclusively from continuum elastic descriptions,
a current challenge is to understand the connection between microscopic
physical properties of misfitting ``building blocks"" and emergent assembly
behavior at mesoscale. We present and analyze a particle-based description of
what is arguably the best studied example for frustrated soft matter assembly,
negative-curvature ribbon assembly, observed in both assemblies of chiral
surfactants and shape-frustrated nanoparticles. Based on our particle model,
known as {\it saddle wedge monomers}, we numerically test the connection
between microscopic shape and interactions of the misfitting subunits and the
emergent behavior at the supra-particle scale, specifically focusing on the
propagation and relaxation of inter-particle strains, the emergent role of
extrinsic shape on frustrated ribbons and the equilibrium regime of finite
width selection. Beyond the intuitive role of shape misfit, we show that
self-limitation is critically dependent on the finite range of cohesive
interactions, with larger size finite assemblies requiring increasing
short-range interparticle forces. Additionally, we demonstrate that
non-linearities arising from discrete particle interactions alter self-limiting
behavior due to both strain-softening in shape-flattened assembly and partial
yielding of highly strained bonds, which in turn may give rise to states of
hierarchical, multidomain assembly. Tracing the regimes of frustration-limited
assembly to the specific microscopic features of misfitting particle shapes and
interactions provides necessary guidance for translating the theory of
size-programmable assembly into design of intentionally-frustrated colloidal
particles.

However, model-free RL algorithms are sample inefficient and require thousands
if not millions of samples to learn optimal control policies. A major source of
computational cost in RL corresponds to the transition function, which is
dictated by the model dynamics. This is especially problematic when model
dynamics is represented with coupled PDEs. In such cases, the transition
function often involves solving a large-scale discretization of the said PDEs.
We propose a multilevel RL framework in order to ease this cost by exploiting
sublevel models that correspond to coarser scale discretization (i.e.
multilevel models). This is done by formulating an approximate multilevel Monte
Carlo estimate of the objective function of the policy and / or value network
instead of Monte Carlo estimates, as done in the classical framework. As a
demonstration of this framework, we present a multilevel version of the
proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Here, the level refers to the
grid fidelity of the chosen simulation-based environment. We provide two
examples of simulation-based environments that employ stochastic PDEs that are
solved using finite-volume discretization. For the case studies presented, we
observed substantial computational savings using multilevel PPO compared to its
classical counterpart.

for local AGN in bins of low and high obscuration (log NH <= 22 and 22 < log NH
< 25), using the Swift-BAT 70-month/BASS DR2 survey. We interpret the fraction
of obscured AGN in terms of circum-nuclear geometry and temporal evolution.
Specifically, at low Eddington ratios (log lamEdd < -2), obscured AGN outnumber
unobscured ones by a factor of ~4, reflecting the covering factor of the
circum-nuclear material (0.8, or a torus opening angle of ~ 34 degrees). At
high Eddington ratios (\log lamEdd > -1), the trend is reversed, with < 30% of
AGN having log NH > 22, which we suggest is mainly due to the small fraction of
time spent in a highly obscured state. Considering the Eddington ratio
distribution function of narrow-line and broad-line AGN from our prior work, we
see a qualitatively similar picture. To disentangle temporal and geometric
effects at high lamEdd, we explore plausible clearing scenarios such that the
time-weighted covering factors agree with the observed population ratio. We
find that the low fraction of obscured AGN at high lamEdd is primarily due to
the fact that the covering factor drops very rapidly, with more than half the
time is spent with < 10% covering factor. We also find that nearly all obscured
AGN at high-lamEdd exhibit some broad-lines. We suggest that this is because
the height of the depleted torus falls below the height of the broad-line
region, making the latter visible from all lines of sight.

assumes time-varying scale of Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking. The latter
decreases as the Universe's temperature at early times and eventually
stabilises at a large constant value. Such behavior is caused by the portal
interaction between the complex field carrying Peccei-Quinn charge and a
Higgs-like scalar, which is in thermal equilibrium with primordial plasma. In
this scenario, axions are efficiently produced during the parametric resonance
decay of the complex Peccei-Quinn field, relaxing to the minimum of its
potential in the radiation-dominated stage. Notably, this process is not
affected by the Universe's expansion rate and allows to generate the required
abundance of dark matter independently of an axion mass. Phenomenological
constraints on the model parameter space depend on the number density of radial
field fluctuations, which are also generically excited along with axions, and
the rate of their thermalization in the primordial plasma. For the ratio of
radial field and axion particles number densities larger than $\sim 0.01$ at
the end of parametric resonance decay, the combination of cosmological and
astrophysical observations with the CAST limit confines the Peccei-Quinn scale
to a narrow range of values $\sim 10^{8}~\mbox{GeV}$, - this paves the way for
ruling out our scenario with the near future searches for axions.

pairs after decomposition; and, the complete (not pairwise) Mutual Information
Reduction (MIR) produced by each algorithm. We also measure the ""dipolarity"" of
the scalp projection maps for the decomposed component, defined by the number
of components whose scalp projection maps nearly match the projection of a
single equivalent dipole. Within this framework, Picard performed similarly to

many real-world problems that require accurate prediction from a very large

large label space is to arrange the labels into a shallow tree-based index and
then learn an ML model to efficiently search this index via beam search.
Existing methods initialize the tree index by clustering the label space into a
few mutually exclusive clusters based on pre-defined features and keep it fixed
throughout the training procedure. This approach results in a sub-optimal
indexing structure over the label space and limits the search performance to
the quality of choices made during the initialization of the index. In this
paper, we propose a novel method ELIAS which relaxes the tree-based index to a
specialized weighted graph-based index which is learned end-to-end with the
final task objective. More specifically, ELIAS models the discrete
cluster-to-label assignments in the existing tree-based index as soft learnable
parameters that are learned jointly with the rest of the ML model. ELIAS
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several large-scale extreme

  Condition",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study the stability of accuracy during the training of deep neural
networks (DNNs). In this context, the training of a DNN is performed via the
minimization of a cross-entropy loss function, and the performance metric is
accuracy (the proportion of objects that are classified correctly). While
training results in a decrease of loss, the accuracy does not necessarily
increase during the process and may sometimes even decrease. The goal of
achieving stability of accuracy is to ensure that if accuracy is high at some
initial time, it remains high throughout training.
  A recent result by Berlyand, Jabin, and Safsten introduces a doubling
condition on the training data, which ensures the stability of accuracy during
training for DNNs using the absolute value activation function. For training
data in $\mathbb{R}^n$, this doubling condition is formulated using slabs in
$\mathbb{R}^n$ and depends on the choice of the slabs. The goal of this paper
is twofold. First, to make the doubling condition uniform, that is, independent
of the choice of slabs. This leads to sufficient conditions for stability in
terms of training data only. In other words, for a training set $T$ that
satisfies the uniform doubling condition, there exists a family of DNNs such
that a DNN from this family with high accuracy on the training set at some
training time $t_0$ will have high accuracy for all time $t>t_0$. Moreover,
establishing uniformity is necessary for the numerical implementation of the
doubling condition.
  The second goal is to extend the original stability results from the absolute
value activation function to a broader class of piecewise linear activation
functions with finitely many critical points, such as the popular Leaky ReLU.

overhead to be performed offline, thus meeting the low latency requirements for
online inference. (2) To speed up offline preparation, we first design novel
homomorphic parallel computing techniques to accelerate the authenticated
Beaver's triple (including matrix-vector and convolution triples) generation
procedure. It achieves up to $1.7\times$ computation speedup and gains at least
$10.7\times$ less communication overhead compared to state-of-the-art work. (3)
We also present a new cryptographic protocol to evaluate the activation
functions of non-linear layers, which is $4\times$--$42\times$ faster and has
$>48\times$ lesser communication than existing 2PC protocol against malicious

The calculated damping frequency of bulk Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ increases monotonically

process, despite the data coming from the user side recommender systems also
generate exposure data to provide users with personalized recommendation
slates. Compared with the sparse user behavior data, the system exposure data
is much larger in volume since only very few exposed items would be clicked by
the user. Besides, the users historical behavior data is privacy sensitive and
is commonly protected with careful access authorization. However, the large
volume of recommender exposure data usually receives less attention and could
be accessed within a relatively larger scope of various information seekers. In
this paper, we investigate the problem of user behavior leakage in recommender
systems. We show that the privacy sensitive user past behavior data can be
inferred through the modeling of system exposure. Besides, one can infer which
items the user have clicked just from the observation of current system
exposure for this user. Given the fact that system exposure data could be
widely accessed from a relatively larger scope, we believe that the user past
behavior privacy has a high risk of leakage in recommender systems. More
precisely, we conduct an attack model whose input is the current recommended
item slate (i.e., system exposure) for the user while the output is the user's
historical behavior. Experimental results on two real-world datasets indicate a
great danger of user behavior leakage. To address the risk, we propose a
two-stage privacy-protection mechanism which firstly selects a subset of items
from the exposure slate and then replaces the selected items with uniform or
popularity-based exposure. Experimental evaluation reveals a trade-off effect
between the recommendation accuracy and the privacy disclosure risk.

Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), in a model independent manner
by using three distinct channels of the charged-current (CC), neutral-current
(NC) and elastic scattering (ES) interactions. Due to the largest-ever mass of
$^{13}$C nuclei in the liquid-scintillator detectors and the potential low
background level, $^8$B solar neutrinos would be observable in the CC and NC
interactions on $^{13}$C for the first time. By virtue of optimized event
selections and muon veto strategies, backgrounds from the accidental
coincidence, muon-induced isotopes, and external backgrounds can be greatly
suppressed. Excellent signal-to-background ratios can be achieved in the CC, NC
and ES channels to guarantee the $^8$B solar neutrino observation. From the
sensitivity studies performed in this work, we show that one can reach the
precision levels of 5%, 8% and 20% for the $^8$B neutrino flux,
$\sin^2\theta_{12}$, and $\Delta m^2_{21}$, respectively, using ten years of
JUNO data. It would be unique and helpful to probe the details of both solar
physics and neutrino physics. In addition, when combined with SNO, the
world-best precision of 3% is expected for the $^8$B neutrino flux measurement.

construction policy. In this paper, we formulate the dynamic memory
construction in ER as a combinatorial optimization problem, which aims at
directly minimizing the global loss across all experienced tasks. We first
apply three tactics to solve the problem in the offline setting as a starting

statistics, engineering, and the sciences. A canonical approach is the Langevin
Algorithm, i.e., the Markov chain for the discretized Langevin Diffusion. This
is the sampling analog of Gradient Descent. Despite being studied for several
decades in multiple communities, tight mixing bounds for this algorithm remain
unresolved even in the seemingly simple setting of log-concave distributions
over a bounded domain. This paper completely characterizes the mixing time of
the Langevin Algorithm to its stationary distribution in this setting (and
others). This mixing result can be combined with any bound on the
discretization bias in order to sample from the stationary distribution of the
continuous Langevin Diffusion. In this way, we disentangle the study of the
mixing and bias of the Langevin Algorithm.
  Our key insight is to introduce a technique from the differential privacy
literature to the sampling literature. This technique, called Privacy
Amplification by Iteration, uses as a potential a variant of R\'enyi divergence
that is made geometrically aware via Optimal Transport smoothing. This gives a
short, simple proof of optimal mixing bounds and has several additional
appealing properties. First, our approach removes all unnecessary assumptions
required by other sampling analyses. Second, our approach unifies many
settings: it extends unchanged if the Langevin Algorithm uses projections,
stochastic mini-batch gradients, or strongly convex potentials (whereby our
mixing time improves exponentially). Third, our approach exploits convexity
only through the contractivity of a gradient step -- reminiscent of how
convexity is used in textbook proofs of Gradient Descent. In this way, we offer
a new approach towards further unifying the analyses of optimization and
sampling algorithms.

topological invariants of the dynamical system. It is known that such a pair
always exists for arbitrary Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms given on any manifolds
of dimension $n \geqslant 3$. Whereas for $n=2$ the existence of a connected
characteristic space has been proved only for orientation-preserving
gradient-like (without heteroclinic points) diffeomorphisms defined on an
orientable surface. In the present work, it is constructively shown that the

given a text as a query, and is one of the fundamental tasks in Multimedia.
Most of top-performing methods primarily leverage Visual Transformer (ViT) to
extract video features [1, 2, 3], suffering from high computational complexity
of ViT especially for encoding long videos. A common and simple solution is to
uniformly sample a small number (say, 4 or 8) of frames from the video (instead
of using the whole video) as input to ViT. The number of frames has a strong
influence on the performance of ViT, e.g., using 8 frames performs better than
using 4 frames yet needs more computational resources, resulting in a
trade-off. To get free from this trade-off, this paper introduces an automatic
video compression method based on a bilevel optimization program (BOP)
consisting of both model-level (i.e., base-level) and frame-level (i.e.,
meta-level) optimizations. The model-level learns a cross-modal video retrieval
model whose input is the ""compressed frames"" learned by frame-level
optimization. In turn, the frame-level optimization is through gradient descent
using the meta loss of video retrieval model computed on the whole video. We
call this BOP method as well as the ""compressed frames"" as Meta-Optimized
Frames (MOF). By incorporating MOF, the video retrieval model is able to
utilize the information of whole videos (for training) while taking only a
small number of input frames in actual implementation. The convergence of MOF

to the multi-head self-attention (MSA). The MSA enables global interactions at

Neural Networks (CNNs) that gradually increase the range of interaction across
multiple layers. We study the role of the density of the attention. Our
preliminary analyses suggest that the spatial interactions of attention maps
are close to dense interactions rather than sparse ones. This is a curious
phenomenon, as dense attention maps are harder for the model to learn due to
steeper softmax gradients around them. We interpret this as a strong preference
for ViT models to include dense interaction. We thus manually insert the
uniform attention to each layer of ViT models to supply the much needed dense
interactions. We call this method Context Broadcasting, CB. We observe that the
inclusion of CB reduces the degree of density in the original attention maps

incurs negligible costs: 1 line in your model code, no additional parameters,

compactifications with fluxes, from the 4d and the 10d point of view.
  We start by reviewing type IIA Calabi-Yau orientifold compactifications with
fluxes. We consider RR and NSNS fluxes, and then add (non)-geometric fluxes. We
recall how the potential can be written as a bilinear expression and review the
main swampland conjectures involving these scenarios.
  Once the basics have been setted, we perform a systematic search of vacua,
using directly the 4d action. We focus first on the case with RR and NSNS
fluxes and then repeat the same game by including geometric fluxes. We find
several families of SUSY and non-SUSY AdS$_4$ vacua. We check which of them are
(perturbatively) stable and which have separation of scales.
  We then analyse from the 10d perspective the SUSY vacua derived in the 4d
effective theory. We comment on how an uplift to $SU(3)$ structure manifolds
does not exist unless the O6 planes are smeared. We go beyond this
approximation and look for an uplift in $SU(3)\times SU(3)$ manifolds,
considering only the case with RR and NSNS fluxes. To do so, we expand the
equations of motion in terms of $g_s$. At zeroth order we recover the smearing
approximation. We solve the expansion at first order, where the localised
nature of the O6-planes is taken into account.
  We use the same machinery to study the non-perturbative stability of some of
the families of non-SUSY vacua with only RR and NSNS fluxes. According to a
refined version of the weak gravity conjecture, there should be membranes in
the spectrum with $Q > T$, triggering its decay. We see that D8 branes wrapping
the internal manifold with D6 branes ending on them can satisfy this
requirement.

accurately described by the canonical Velocity Dependent One-Scale (VOS) model.
However, numerical simulations have demonstrated the existence of significant
quantities of short-wavelength propagation modes on the strings, known as
wiggles, which motivated the recent development of a wiggly string extension of
the VOS. Here we summarize recent progress in the physical interpretation of
this model through a systematic study of the allowed asymptotic scaling
solutions of the model. The modeling mainly relies on three mechanisms: the
universe's expansion rate, energy transfer mechanisms (e.g., the production of
loops and wiggles), and the choice of the scale in which wiggles are
coarse-grained. We consider the various limits in which each mechanism
dominates and compare the scaling solutions for each case, in order to gain
insight into the role of each mechanism in the overall behavior of the network.
Our results show that there are three scaling regimes for the wiggliness,
consisting of the well-known Nambu-Goto solution, and non-trivial regimes where
the amount of wiggliness can grow as the network evolves or, for specific
expansion rates, become a constant. We also demonstrate that full scaling of
the network is more likely in the matter era than in the radiation epoch, in
agreement with numerical simulations.

quantum algorithms, most famously as being the essential ingredient in Shor's
algorithm for factoring products of primes. Given its remarkable capability,
one would think it can introduce large entanglement to qubit systems and would
be difficult to simulate classically. While early results showed QFT indeed has
maximal operator entanglement, we show that this is entirely due to the bit
reversal in the QFT. The core part of the QFT has Schmidt coefficients decaying
exponentially quickly, and thus it can only generate a constant amount of
entanglement regardless of the number of qubits. In addition, we show the
entangling power of the QFT is the same as the time evolution of a Hamiltonian
with exponentially decaying interactions, and thus a variant of the area law
for dynamics can be used to understand the low entanglement intuitively. Using
the low entanglement property of the QFT, we show that classical simulations of
the QFT on a matrix product state with low bond dimension only take time linear
in the number of qubits, providing a potential speedup over the classical fast
Fourier transform (FFT) on many classes of functions. We demonstrate this
speedup in test calculations on some simple functions. For data vectors of

on Semantic Sentence Matching. Meanwhile, dependency prior knowledge has also
shown general benefits in multiple NLP tasks. However, how to efficiently
integrate dependency prior structure into pre-trained models to better model
complex semantic matching relations is still unsettled. In this paper, we
propose the \textbf{D}ependency-Enhanced \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{F}usion
\textbf{A}ttention (\textbf{DAFA}), which explicitly introduces dependency
structure into pre-trained models and adaptively fuses it with semantic
information. Specifically, \textbf{\emph{(i)}} DAFA first proposes a
structure-sensitive paradigm to construct a dependency matrix for calibrating
attention weights. It adopts an adaptive fusion module to integrate the
obtained dependency information and the original semantic signals. Moreover,
DAFA reconstructs the attention calculation flow and provides better
interpretability. By applying it on BERT, our method achieves state-of-the-art
or competitive performance on 10 public datasets, demonstrating the benefits of
adaptively fusing dependency structure in semantic matching task.

existing black-box attacks fool target model by generating either global
perturbations or local patches. However, both global perturbations and local
patches easily cause annoying visual artifacts in adversarial example. Compared
with some smooth regions of an image, the object region generally has more
edges and a more complex texture. Thus small perturbations on it will be more
imperceptible. On the other hand, the object region is undoubtfully the
decisive part of an image to classification tasks. Motivated by these two
facts, we propose an object-attentional adversarial attack method for
untargeted attack. Specifically, we first generate an object region by
intersecting the object detection region from YOLOv4 with the salient object
detection (SOD) region from HVPNet. Furthermore, we design an activation
strategy to avoid the reaction caused by the incomplete SOD. Then, we perform
an adversarial attack only on the detected object region by leveraging Simple
Black-box Adversarial Attack (SimBA). To verify the proposed method, we create
a unique dataset by extracting all the images containing the object defined by
COCO from ImageNet-1K, named COCO-Reduced-ImageNet in this paper. Experimental
results on ImageNet-1K and COCO-Reduced-ImageNet show that under various system
settings, our method yields the adversarial example with better perceptual
quality meanwhile saving the query budget up to 24.16\% compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches including SimBA.

vector in a Hilbert space called the feature space and modeling the target
function as a linear map on the feature space. Given a cost function, computing
such an optimal linear map requires computation of a kernel matrix whose
entries equal the inner products of feature vectors. In the quantum kernel
method it is assumed that the feature vectors are quantum states in which case
the quantum kernel matrix is given in terms of the overlap of quantum states.
In practice, to estimate entries of the quantum kernel matrix one should apply,
e.g., the SWAP-test and the number of such SWAP-tests is a relevant parameter
in evaluating the performance of the quantum kernel method. Moreover, quantum
systems are subject to noise, so the quantum states as feature vectors cannot
be prepared exactly and this is another source of error in the computation of
the quantum kernel matrix. Taking both the above considerations into account,
we prove a bound on the performance (generalization error) of the quantum

suboptimal results if those imperfections are ignored. Motivated by this, we

and apply it to the problem of robust graph filter (GF) identification from
input-output observations. Different from existing works, we formulate a
non-convex optimization problem that operates in the vertex domain and jointly
performs GF identification and graph denoising. As a result, on top of learning
the desired GF, an estimate of the graph is obtained as a byproduct. To handle

from alternating optimization and majorization minimization, showing its
convergence to a stationary point. The second part of the paper i) generalizes
the design to a robust setup where several GFs are jointly estimated, and ii)
introduces an alternative algorithmic implementation that reduces the

certain low-level stroke-based decomposition or medium-level radical-based
decomposition. Considering that the stroke- and radical-level decompositions
can provide different levels of information, we propose an effective zero-shot
Chinese character recognition method by combining them. The proposed method
consists of a training stage and an inference stage. In the training stage, we
adopt two similar encoder-decoder models to yield the estimates of stroke and
radical encodings, which together with the true encodings are then used to
formalize the associated stroke and radical losses for training. A similarity
loss is introduced to regularize stroke and radical encoders to yield features
of the same characters with high correlation. In the inference stage, two key
modules, i.e., the stroke screening module (SSM) and feature matching module
(FMM) are introduced to tackle the deterministic and confusing cases
respectively. In particular, we introduce an effective stroke rectification
scheme in FMM to enlarge the candidate set of characters for final inference.
Numerous experiments over three benchmark datasets covering the handwritten,
printed artistic and street view scenarios are conducted to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Numerical results show that the proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both character and radical
zero-shot settings, and maintains competitive performance in the traditional
seen character setting.

We do not find any convinced QPO signal with significance above 3 $\sigma$,

properties of both the precursors and main emissions are also studied for the
first time, and no significant difference is found in the distributions of the

loudspeaker to emit near-inaudible chirps and then the microphone to record the

that the echoes carry location information with sub-meter granularity. To
enable SLAM, we apply contrastive learning to construct an echoic location

detection results effectively regulate the IMU-based trajectory reconstruction.
Extensive experiments show that our ELF-based SLAM achieves median localization

Bayesian optimization (MOBO) has been widely used for finding a finite set of
Pareto optimal solutions. However, it is well-known that the whole Pareto set
is on a continuous manifold and can contain infinite solutions. The structural
properties of the Pareto set are not well exploited in existing MOBO methods,
and the finite-set approximation may not contain the most preferred solution(s)

approximate the whole Pareto set for MOBO, which generalizes the
decomposition-based multi-objective optimization algorithm (MOEA/D) from finite

method based on the learned Pareto set, which naturally supports batch

explore any trade-off area in the approximate Pareto set for flexible

Furthermore, urban density has been investigated in a spatially coarse manner

behavioural therapy (tCBT) for people with chronic pain. We tested the
hypothesis that the effect of tCBT would be mediated by improvements in active
coping, passive coping, fear of movement and sleep problems. The analysis of
MUSICIAN data shows that tCBT has better-improved patients' self-perceived
change in health status compared to treatment as usual (TAU). The adjusted
log-odds of tCBT compared to TAU range from 1.491 (0.452, 2.612) when adjusted
for sleep problems to 2.264 (1.063, 3.610) when adjusted for fear of movement.
Higher scores of fear of movement (log-odds, -0.141 (-0.245, -0.048)), passive

solvability of the numerical algorithm and verify its unconditional energy
stability without any restriction on the time step size. Thanks to the singular
nature of the logarithmic part in the Flory-Huggins potential near the pure
states $\pm 1$, we establish the so-called positivity-preserving property for
the phase function at a theoretic level. As a consequence, the numerical
solutions will never reach the singular values $\pm 1$ in the point-wise sense

asymptotic expansion (up to the second order temporal and spatial accuracy)

to the continuous problem is strictly separated from the pure states $\pm 1$,
then the numerical solutions can be kept away from $\pm 1$ by a positive
distance that is uniform with respect to the size of the time step and the

are receiving considerable attention because of their combination of CMOS
compatibility, unique epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) behavior, and giant ultrafast
nonlinear thermo-optic response. However, the understanding of the electronic
and optical response of LEDD materials is so far based on simplistic extensions
of known models of noble metals, frequently without the inclusion of the
interplay among the lower electron density, relatively high Debye energy, and
the non-parabolic band structure. To bridge this knowledge gap, this work
provides a complete understanding of the nonlinear electronic-thermal-optical
response of LEDD materials. In particular, we rely on state-of-the-art electron
dynamics modeling, as well as the newly derived time-dependent permittivity
model for LEDD materials under optical pumping within the adiabatic
approximation. We find that unlike noble metals, the electron temperatures can
reach the Fermi temperature, in which case the effective chemical potential
dramatically decreases and even becomes negative, thus, transiently converting
the Drude metal into a semiconductor. We further show that the nonlinear
optical response of LEDD materials originating from the changes to the real
part of the permittivity is due to the generation of non-thermal electrons.
This resolves the argument about the rise time of the permittivity and shows
that it is instantaneous. In this vein, we show that referring to the LEDD
permittivity as having a ``saturable'' nonlinearity is unsuitable since its
permittivity dynamics does not originate from population inversion. Finally, we
analyze the probe pulse dynamics and unlike previous work, we obtain a
quantitative agreement with the results of recent experiments.

  Our goal is to redesign the core and cache hierarchy, given the fundamentally
new trade-offs of M3D, to benefit a wide range of workloads. To this end, we
take two steps. First, we perform a design space exploration of the cache and
core's key components. We highlight that in M3D systems, (i) removing the
shared last-level cache leads to similar or larger performance benefits than
increasing its size or reducing its latency; (ii) improving L1 latency has a
large impact on improving performance; (iii) wider pipelines are increasingly
beneficial; (iv) the performance impact of branch speculation and pipeline
frontend increases; (v) the current synchronization schemes limit parallel
speedup. Second, we propose an optimized M3D system, RevaMp3D, where (i) using
the tight connectivity between logic layers, we efficiently increase pipeline
width, reduce L1 latency, and enable fine-grained synchronization; (ii) using
the high-bandwidth and energy-efficient main memory, we alleviate the amplified
energy and speculation bottlenecks by memoizing the repetitive fetched,

three solutions are found. There always exist two equatorial photon orbits
outside the event horizon in this case. For orbits between the above two
special planes, there are four or two solutions to the general sextic equation.
When the black hole is extremal, it is found that there is a critical
inclination angle $v_{cr}$, below which only one orbit exists and above which
two orbits exist outside the event horizon for a rapidly rotating black hole
$u>\frac{1}{4}$. At this critical inclination angle, exact formula for the
radii is also derived. Finally, a critical surface in parameter space of
($u,w,v$) is shown that separates regions with four or two solutions.

with orbits of low eccentricity that reach a maximum height from the Galactic

origins. We use data from the internal data release 6 of the Gaia-ESO Survey.
We selected stars observed at high resolution with abundances of 21 species of
18 individual elements. We apply hierarchical clustering to group the stars
with similar chemical abundances within the complete chemical abundance space.
According to their chemical properties, this set of super metal-rich stars can
be arranged into five subgroups. Four seem to follow a chemical enrichment
flow, where nearly all abundances increase in lockstep with Fe. The fifth
subgroup shows different chemical characteristics. All subgroups have the
following features: median ages of the order of 7-9 Gyr, Solar or sub-Solar
[Mg/Fe] ratios, maximum height between 0.5-1.5 kpc, low eccentricities, and a
detachment from the expected metallicity gradient with guiding radius. The high
metallicity of our stars is incompatible with a formation in the Solar
neighbourhood. Their dynamic properties agree with theoretical expectations
that these stars travelled from the inner Galaxy due to blurring and, most
importantly, to churning. We suggest that most of this population's stars
originated in the Milky Way's inner regions (inner disc and/or the bulge) and
later migrated to the Solar neighbourhood. The region from where the stars
originated had a complex chemical enrichment history, with contributions from
supernovae types Ia and II and possibly asymptotic giant branch stars.

perceptual accuracy for single object tracking in LiDAR point clouds, they
advance with some heavy correlation operations on relation modeling and
overlook the inherent merit of arbitrariness compared to multiple object
tracking. In this work, we propose a radically novel one-stream network with
the strength of the Transformer encoding, which avoids the correlation
operations occurring in previous Siamese network, thus considerably reducing
the computational effort. In particular, the proposed method mainly consists of
a Template-aware Transformer Module (TTM) and a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation
(MFA) module capable of fusing spatial and semantic information. The TTM
stitches the specified template and the search region together and leverages an
attention mechanism to establish the information flow, breaking the previous
pattern of independent \textit{extraction-and-correlation}. As a result, this
module makes it possible to directly generate template-aware features that are
suitable for the arbitrary and continuously changing nature of the target,
enabling the model to deal with unseen categories. In addition, the MFA is
proposed to make spatial and semantic information complementary to each other,
which is characterized by reverse directional feature propagation that
aggregates information from shallow to deep layers. Extensive experiments on
KITTI and nuScenes demonstrate that our method has achieved considerable
performance not only for class-specific tracking but also for class-agnostic
tracking with less computation and higher efficiency.

E2E-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Especially, it also works
in low-resource scenarios. However, SpecAugment masks the spectrum of time or
the frequency domain in a fixed augmentation policy, which may bring relatively
less data diversity to the low-resource ASR. In this paper, we propose a
policy-based SpecAugment (Policy-SpecAugment) method to alleviate the above
problem. The idea is to use the augmentation-select policy and the
augmentation-parameter changing policy to solve the fixed way. These policies
are learned based on the loss of validation set, which is applied to the
corresponding augmentation policies. It aims to encourage the model to learn
more diverse data, which the model relatively requires. In experiments, we
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in low-resource scenarios, i.e., the
100 hours librispeech task. According to the results and analysis, we can see
that the above issue can be obviously alleviated using our proposal. In
addition, the experimental results show that, compared with the
state-of-the-art SpecAugment, the proposed Policy-SpecAugment has a relative
WER reduction of more than 10% on the Test/Dev-clean set, more than 5% on the

way we approach and use intelligent machines in the Big Data era. Despite
success, CNNs have been consistently put under scrutiny owing to their
\textit{black-box} nature, an \textit{ad hoc} manner of their construction,
together with the lack of theoretical support and physical meanings of their
operation. This has been prohibitive to both the quantitative and qualitative
understanding of CNNs, and their application in more sensitive areas such as AI
for health. We set out to address these issues, and in this way demystify the
operation of CNNs, by employing the perspective of matched filtering. We first
illuminate that the convolution operation, the very core of CNNs, represents a
matched filter which aims to identify the presence of features in input data.
This then serves as a vehicle to interpret the convolution-activation-pooling
chain in CNNs under the theoretical umbrella of matched filtering, a common
operation in signal processing. We further provide extensive examples and
experiments to illustrate this connection, whereby the learning in CNNs is
shown to also perform matched filtering, which further sheds light onto
physical meaning of learnt parameters and layers. It is our hope that this
material will provide new insights into the understanding, constructing and
analysing of CNNs, as well as paving the way for developing new methods and

poorly for extreme quantiles. For this situation, under weak assumptions we
derive an extreme value theorem and an intermediate order theorem for noisy

used to construct confidence intervals for extremal quantiles. The intervals
are simple to construct and require no optimization. Inference based on the

different domains. In education research, there is a growing need to have
access to synthetic data to test certain concepts and ideas. In recent years,
several deep learning architectures were used to aid in the generation of
synthetic data but with varying results. In the education context, the
sophistication of implementing different models requiring large datasets is
becoming very important. This study aims to compare the application of
synthetic tabular data generation between a probabilistic model specifically a
Bayesian Network, and a deep learning model, specifically a Generative
Adversarial Network using a classification task. The results of this study
indicate that synthetic tabular data generation is better suited for the
education context using probabilistic models (overall accuracy of 75%) than
deep learning architecture (overall accuracy of 38%) because of probabilistic
interdependence. Lastly, we recommend that other data types, should be explored
and evaluated for their application in generating synthetic data for education
use cases.

detection, which aims to classify tampered images and localize tampered
regions. Most existing methods mainly focus on extracting global features from
tampered images, while neglecting the relationships of local features between
tampered and authentic regions within a single tampered image. To exploit such
spatial relationships, we propose Proposal Contrastive Learning (PCL) for
effective image manipulation detection. Our PCL consists of a two-stream
architecture by extracting two types of global features from RGB and noise
views respectively. To further improve the discriminative power, we exploit the
relationships of local features through a proxy proposal contrastive learning
task by attracting/repelling proposal-based positive/negative sample pairs.
Moreover, we show that our PCL can be easily adapted to unlabeled data in
practice, which can reduce manual labeling costs and promote more generalizable
features. Extensive experiments among several standard datasets demonstrate
that our PCL can be a general module to obtain consistent improvement. The code

the dissipative response of uncondensed quasiparticles, which do not couple in

both the enhancement of the superfluid density, $\omega\sigma_2(\omega)$, and
the dissipative response of quasiparticles, $\sigma_1(\omega)$, by
systematically tuning the duration and energy of the mid-infrared pulse while
keeping the peak field fixed. We find that the photo-induced superfluid density
saturates to the zero-temperature equilibrium value for pulses made longer than
the phonon dephasing time, whilst the dissipative component continues to grow
with increasing pulse duration. We show that superfluid and dissipation remain
uncoupled as long as the drive is on, and identify an optimal regime of pump

Many machine learning-based methods have been proposed for this task. However,
to our best knowledge, existing methods all require manually crafted seed
alignments, which are expensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose the first
fully automatic alignment method named TransAlign, which does not require any
manually crafted seed alignments. Specifically, for predicate embeddings,
TransAlign constructs a predicate-proximity-graph to automatically capture the
similarity between predicates across two KGs by learning the attention of
entity types. For entity embeddings, TransAlign first computes the entity
embeddings of each KG independently using TransE, and then shifts the two KGs'
entity embeddings into the same vector space by computing the similarity
between entities based on their attributes. Thus, both predicate alignment and
entity alignment can be done without manually crafted seed alignments.
TransAlign is not only fully automatic, but also highly effective. Experiments
using real-world KGs show that TransAlign improves the accuracy of entity
alignment significantly compared to state-of-the-art methods.

is consistent with the assumption that these photons are entangled in
polarization. Yet, unexpectedly, recent experiments differ as regards the
correlation of polarization direction of back-to-back photons after the
decoherence induced by scattering of one of these photons on the electron in
the scattering material. In one of the experiments, the correlation before and
after the decoherence of the photon state is the same and in the other
experiment the scattering of one photon leads to a significant decrease in this
correlation. Here we discuss this puzzle. The decoherent states were ensured by
forcing one of the annihilation photons through prior scattering before the
Compton kinematics based measurement of the polarization correlation. A
comparison between the experimental setups used for the different measurements
and the results obtained are briefly discussed, highlighting the parameters
that are important for performing such measurements. Finally, the main features

basic studies of entanglement, as well as for the proposed application of

conditioned on tables and logical forms, which not only requires a deep
understanding of the tables and logical forms, but also warrants symbolic
reasoning over the tables. State-of-the-art methods based on pre-trained models
have achieved remarkable performance on the standard test dataset. However, we
question whether these methods really learn how to perform logical reasoning,
rather than just relying on the spurious correlations between the headers of
the tables and operators of the logical form. To verify this hypothesis, we
manually construct a set of counterfactual samples, which modify the original
logical forms to generate counterfactual logical forms with rarely co-occurred
table headers and logical operators. SOTA methods give much worse results on
these counterfactual samples compared with the results on the original test
dataset, which verifies our hypothesis. To deal with this problem, we firstly
analyze this bias from a causal perspective, based on which we propose two
approaches to reduce the model's reliance on the shortcut. The first one
incorporates the hierarchical structure of the logical forms into the model.
The second one exploits automatically generated counterfactual data for
training. Automatic and manual experimental results on the original test
dataset and the counterfactual dataset show that our method is effective to
alleviate the spurious correlation. Our work points out the weakness of

increased dramatically during the previous decade. The increased penetration of
PVs into distribution networks (DNs) can cause voltage fluctuations that have
to be mitigated. One of the key utility assets employed to this end are
step-voltage regulators (SVRs). It is desirable to include tap selection of
SVRs in optimal power flow (OPF) routines, a task that turns out to be
challenging because the resultant OPF problem is nonconvex with added
complexities stemming from accurate SVR modeling. While several convex
relaxations based on semi-definite programming (SDP) have been presented in the
literature for optimal tap selection, SDP-based schemes do not scale well and
are challenging to implement in large-scale planning or operational frameworks.
This paper deals with the optimal tap selection (OPTS) problem for
wye-connected SVRs using linear approximations of power flow equations.
Specifically, the $\textit{LinDist3Flow}$ model is adopted and the effective
SVR ratio is assumed to be continuous--enabling the formulation of a problem
called $\textit{LinDist3Flow-OPTS}$, which amounts to a linear program. The
scalability and optimality gap of $\textit{LinDist3Flow-OPTS}$ are evaluated
with respect to existing SDP-based and nonlinear programming techniques for
optimal tap selection in three standard feeders, namely, the IEEE 13-bus,
123-bus, and 8500-node DNs. For all DNs considered,
$\textit{LinDist3Flow-OPTS}$ achieves an optimality gap of approximately $1\%$
or less while significantly lowering the computational burden.

coherent lightwave-driven processes and measure electronic structures as
recently demonstrated for semiconductors. However, such demonstration has been
largely limited for semimetals because the absence of the bandgap hinders an

combining electrostatic control of chemical potentials with HHG measurement, we
resolve quantum pathways of massless Dirac fermions in graphene under strong

the multi-photon interband excitation channels. As the light-matter interaction
deviates beyond the perturbative regime, elliptically polarized laser fields
efficiently drive massless Dirac fermions via an intricate coupling between the
interband and intraband transitions, which is corroborated by our theoretical

take advantage of their brightness to investigate their soft gamma-ray (0.1-2

to probe their high-energy emission with the aim to bring new constraints on
the ~ MeV emission. We first study the spectral characteristics of the sources
in the 3-2000 keV using JEM-X, IBIS and SPI with a semi-phenomenological

evaluate the polarization properties of the sources above 300 keV.

of MAXI J1820+070, the extrapolation of the synchrotron spectrum measured in

fraction of polarization points towards a jets origin, however, we cannot
formally conclude without any infrared data giving information on the optically

entropy stable discretization of the Maxwell's equations. Finally, we use
SSP-RK schemes to discretize in time. We also propose ARK-IMEX schemes to treat
the stiff source terms; the resulting nonlinear set of algebraic equations is
local (at each discretization point). These equations are solved using the
Newton's Method, which results in an efficient method. The proposed schemes are
then tested using various test problems to demonstrate their stability,
accuracy and efficiency.

  Modelling",,,,"cs.AI cs.MA q-fin.TR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-agent market simulation is an effective tool to investigate the impact
of various trading strategies in financial markets. One way of designing a
trading agent in simulated markets is through reinforcement learning where the
agent is trained to optimize its cumulative rewards (e.g., maximizing profits,
minimizing risk, improving equitability). While the agent learns a rational
policy that optimizes the reward function, in reality, human investors are
sub-rational with their decisions often differing from the optimal. In this
work, we model human sub-rationality as resulting from two possible causes:
psychological bias and computational limitation. We first examine the
relationship between investor profits and their degree of sub-rationality, and
create hand-crafted market scenarios to intuitively explain the sub-rational
human behaviors. Through experiments, we show that our models successfully
capture human sub-rationality as observed in the behavioral finance literature.
We also examine the impact of sub-rational human investors on market
observables such as traded volumes, spread and volatility. We believe our work
will benefit research in behavioral finance and provide a better understanding
of human trading behavior.

saturation velocity and larger breakdown voltage, enabling a high intrinsic
time resolution and mitigating pile-up effects. Additionally, as radiation
hardness requirements grow more demanding, wide-bandgap materials such as
4H-SiC could offer better performance. In this work, the detector performance
of 50 micron thick 4H-SiC p-in-n planar pad sensors was investigated at room
temperature, using an 241Am alpha source at reverse biases of up to 1100 V.
Samples subjected to neutron irradiation with fluences of up to 1e16/cm^2 were
included in the study in order to quantify the radiation hardness properties of
4H-SiC. The obtained results are compared to previously performed UV-TCT
studies. Samples exhibit a drop in charge collection efficiency (CCE) with
increasing irradiation fluence, partially compensated at high reverse bias
voltages far above full depletion voltage. A plateau of the collected charges
is observed in accordance with the depletion of the volume the alpha particles
penetrate for an unirradiated reference detector. For the neutron-irradiated
samples, such a plateau only becomes apparent at higher reverse bias. For the
highest investigated fluence, CCE behaves almost linearly with increasing
reverse bias. Compared to UV-TCT measurements, the reverse bias required to
deplete a sensitive volume covering full energy deposition is lower, due to the
small penetration depth of the alpha particles. At the highest reverse bias,
the measured CCE values agree well with earlier UV-TCT studies, with
discrepancies between 1% and 5%.

by developing a new estimator that mitigates the problems of the two most

for biological functions such as regulation, DNA base modification, and
molecular binding in general. The gain and loss of such motifs can carry
important consequences. When comparing sequences, the analysis of individual
variants does not impart an understanding of the impact on these sites. Rather,
only when these variants considered together with their neighbors and the
original sequence context does this become possible.
  Results: The motif-variant probe (mvp) makes this consideration, counting
instances of user-specified sequence motifs before and after mutation and
reports those that result in motif gain or loss. mvp can perform a similar
analysis for proteins with amino acid variant data. The software is freely

introduces hyperbolic embeddings to represent words and topics. With the
tree-likeness property of hyperbolic space, the underlying semantic hierarchy

One of the largest challenges institutions of higher learning currently face is
the scalability of student support. Part of this is due to the shortage of
staff addressing the needs of students, and the subsequent referral pathways
associated to provide timeous student support strategies. This is further
complicated by the difficulty of these referrals, especially as students are
often faced with a combination of administrative, academic, social, and
socio-economic challenges. A possible solution to this problem can be a
combination of student outcome predictions and applying algorithmic recommender
systems within the context of higher education. While much effort and detail
has gone into the expansion of explaining algorithmic decision making in this
context, there is still a need to develop data collection strategies Therefore,
the purpose of this paper is to outline a data collection framework specific to
recommender systems within this context in order to reduce collection biases,
understand student characteristics, and find an ideal way to infer optimal
influences on the student journey. If confirmation biases, challenges in data
sparsity and the type of information to collect from students are not

The alarming increasing rate of ransomware attacks and new ransomware variants
intrigue the researchers to constantly examine the distinguishing traits of
ransomware and refine their detection strategies. Application Programming
Interface (API) is a way for one program to collaborate with another; API calls
are the medium by which they communicate. Ransomware uses this strategy to
interact with the OS and makes a significantly higher number of calls in
different sequences to ask for taking action. This research work utilizes the
frequencies of different API calls to detect and classify ransomware families.
First, a Web-Crawler is developed to automate collecting the Windows Portable
Executable (PE) files of 15 different ransomware families. By extracting
different frequencies of 68 API calls, we develop our dataset in the first
phase of the two-phase feature engineering process. After selecting the most

deploy six Supervised Machine Learning models: Na""ive Bayes, Logistic

compared to select the best model. The results reveal that Logistic Regression
can efficiently classify ransomware into their corresponding families securing
99.15% overall accuracy. Finally, instead of relying on the 'Black box'

recreates the sense and meaning of the song based on a context which either
preexists in a culture or gets formed due to his extended engagement with a
nebulous auditory stimulus that is perceived as meaningful. This is what I call
the work of the creative ear. The affective power of the song comes from an
affective reaction between the singing voice, especially the sung non-language
sounds, and the linguistic and cultural contexts of the singer and the listener
and out this affective reaction something emerges which constitutes the
meaning, sensible or affective, of the non-language sound. I show how the

Despite numerical evidence, and many theoretical progresses, the conjecture has
resisted a formal proof since. In the first part of this paper, we investigate
a stricter version of the conjecture, expressed as follows: ''Let $p_{n}$ be
the n-th prime. Then, there always exist twin primes between $(p_{n}-2)^{2}$

depends on the factorization of M. We compare the predictions with the real
values for M up to 3000 (and for the special case 30030) in the range of from
the 1000000-th prime to the 21000000-th prime.

for gait analysis data. The research question was: Which input features are
used by ML models to classify age-related differences in walking patterns? We
utilized a subset of the AIST Gait Database 2019 containing five bilateral
ground reaction force (GRF) recordings per person during barefoot walking of
healthy participants. Each input signal was min-max normalized before
concatenation and fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Participants
were divided into three age groups: young (20-39 years), middle-aged (40-64
years), and older (65-79 years) adults. The classification accuracy and
relevance scores (derived using LRP) were averaged over a stratified ten-fold
cross-validation. The mean classification accuracy of 60.1% was clearly higher
than the zero-rule baseline of 37.3%. The confusion matrix shows that the CNN
distinguished younger and older adults well, but had difficulty modeling the
middle-aged adults.
