media can be seized to control and manipulate wave phenomena, including thermal
radiation. Here, based upon the framework of macroscopic quantum
electrodynamics, we elaborate a comprehensive quantum theoretical formulation
that lies the basis for investigating thermal emission effects in
time-modulated media. Our theory unveils new physics brought about by
time-varying media: nontrivial correlations between thermal fluctuating
currents at different frequencies and positions, thermal radiation overcoming
the black-body spectrum, and quantum vacuum amplification effects at finite
temperature. We illustrate how these features lead to striking phenomena and
novel thermal emitters, specifically, showing that the time-modulation releases
strong field fluctuations confined within epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) bodies, and
that, in turn, it enables a narrowband (partially coherent) emission spanning
the whole range of wavevectors, from near to far-field regimes.

  Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Long-tail distribution is widely spread in real-world applications. Due to
the extremely small ratio of instances, tail categories often show inferior
accuracy. In this paper, we find such performance bottleneck is mainly caused
by the imbalanced gradients, which can be categorized into two parts: (1)
positive part, deriving from the samples of the same category, and (2) negative
part, contributed by other categories. Based on comprehensive experiments, it
is also observed that the gradient ratio of accumulated positives to negatives
is a good indicator to measure how balanced a category is trained. Inspired by
this, we come up with a gradient-driven training mechanism to tackle the
long-tail problem: re-balancing the positive/negative gradients dynamically
according to current accumulative gradients, with a unified goal of achieving
balance gradient ratios. Taking advantage of the simple and flexible gradient
mechanism, we introduce a new family of gradient-driven loss functions, namely
equalization losses. We conduct extensive experiments on a wide spectrum of
visual tasks, including two-stage/single-stage long-tailed object detection
(LVIS), long-tailed image classification (ImageNet-LT, Places-LT, iNaturalist),
and long-tailed semantic segmentation (ADE20K). Our method consistently
outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed equalization losses. Codes will be

  Multi-Task Collaborative Learning",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data in real-world object detection often exhibits the long-tailed
distribution. Existing solutions tackle this problem by mitigating the
competition between the head and tail categories. However, due to the scarcity
of training samples, tail categories are still unable to learn discriminative
representations. Bringing more data into the training may alleviate the
problem, but collecting instance-level annotations is an excruciating task. In
contrast, image-level annotations are easily accessible but not fully
exploited. In this paper, we propose a novel framework CLIS (multi-task
Collaborative Learning with Image-level Supervision), which leverage
image-level supervision to enhance the detection ability in a multi-task
collaborative way. Specifically, there are an object detection task (consisting
of an instance-classification task and a localization task) and an
image-classification task in our framework, responsible for utilizing the two
types of supervision. Different tasks are trained collaboratively by three key
designs: (1) task-specialized sub-networks that learn specific representations
of different tasks without feature entanglement. (2) a siamese sub-network for
the image-classification task that shares its knowledge with the
instance-classification task, resulting in feature enrichment of detectors. (3)
a contrastive learning regularization that maintains representation
consistency, bridging feature gaps of different supervision. Extensive
experiments are conducted on the challenging LVIS dataset. Without
sophisticated loss engineering, CLIS achieves an overall AP of 31.1 with 10.1
point improvement on tail categories, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code

formulate the new drug recommendation as a few-shot learning problem. Yet,
directly applying existing few-shot learning algorithms faces two challenges:
(1) complex relations among diseases and drugs and (2) numerous false-negative
patients who were eligible but did not yet use the new drugs. To tackle these
challenges, we propose EDGE, which can quickly adapt to the recommendation for
a new drug with limited prescription data from a few support patients. EDGE
maintains a drug-dependent multi-phenotype few-shot learner to bridge the gap

to link new drugs to existing drugs with similar treatment effects and learns
ontology-based drug representations. Such drug representations are used to
customize the metric space of the phenotype-driven patient representations,
which are composed of a set of phenotypes capturing complex patient health
status. Lastly, EDGE eliminates the false-negative supervision signal using an
external drug-disease knowledge base. We evaluate EDGE on two real-world

continuum correctors and discrete multipole terms that are essentially
computable. In this paper, we develop a novel family of numerical schemes that
exploit the multipole expansions to accelerate the simulation of crystalline

To enclose the simulation in a finite domain, a theoretically justified
approximation of multipole tensors is therefore introduced, which leads to a
novel moment iteration as well as the higher order boundary conditions.
Moreover, we consider a continuous version of multipole expansions to acquire
efficiency in practical implementation. Several prototypical numerical examples

the study of intracranial aneurysms (IAs), a dangerous disease that occurs in
the arteries that reach the brain. They may affect up to 10 % of the world's
population, with up to 50 % mortality rate, in case of rupture. Physically, the
blood flow inside IAs should be modeled as a fluid-solid interaction problem.
However, the large majority of those works have focused on the hemodynamics of
the intra-aneurysmal flow, while ignoring the wall tissue's mechanical response
entirely, through rigid-wall modeling, or using limited modeling assumptions
for the tissue mechanics. One of the explanations is the scarce data on the
properties of IAs walls, thus limiting the use of better modeling options.
Unfortunately, this situation is still the case, thus our present study
investigates the effect of different modeling approaches to simulate the motion
of an IA. We used three hyperelastic laws and two different ways of modeling
the wall thickness and tissue mechanical properties -- one assumed that both
were uniform while the other accounted for the heterogeneity of the wall by
using a ""hemodynamics-driven"" approach in which both thickness and material
constants varied spatially with the cardiac-cycle-averaged hemodynamics.
Pulsatile numerical simulations, with patient-specific vascular geometries
harboring IAs, were carried out using the one-way fluid-solid interaction
solution strategy, in which the blood flow is solved and applied as the driving
force of the wall motion. We found that different wall morphology models yield
smaller absolute differences in the mechanical response than different
hyperelastic laws. Furthermore, the stretch levels of IAs walls were more
sensitive to the hyperelastic and material constants than the stress. These
findings could be used to guide modeling decisions on IA simulations.

advances connecting neural networks and kernel methods, namely the Neural
Tangent Kernel (NTK), following a growing body of work that leverages the NTK
approximation to successfully analyze important deep learning phenomena and
design algorithms for new applications. We show how NTKs allow to generate
adversarial examples in a ``training-free'' fashion, and demonstrate that they
transfer to fool their finite-width neural net counterparts in the ``lazy''
regime. We leverage this connection to provide an alternative view on robust
and non-robust features, which have been suggested to underlie the adversarial
brittleness of neural nets. Specifically, we define and study features induced
by the eigendecomposition of the kernel to better understand the role of robust
and non-robust features, the reliance on both for standard classification and
the robustness-accuracy trade-off. We find that such features are surprisingly
consistent across architectures, and that robust features tend to correspond to
the largest eigenvalues of the model, and thus are learned early during
training. Our framework allows us to identify and visualize non-robust yet
useful features. Finally, we shed light on the robustness mechanism underlying
adversarial training of neural nets used in practice: quantifying the evolution
of the associated empirical NTK, we demonstrate that its dynamics falls much
earlier into the ``lazy'' regime and manifests a much stronger form of the well
known bias to prioritize learning features within the top eigenspaces of the

showing that any algorithm achieving good regret against stationary benchmarks
with high probability could be automatically converted to an algorithm that
achieves good regret against dynamic benchmarks, which is applicable to a wide
class of bandit convex optimization algorithms.

nonreciprocity has attracted significant attention due to the absence of
external bias and integrability within conventional material platforms. So far,
nonlinearity-induced nonreciprocity has been demonstrated only in guided
platforms using high-Q resonators. Here, we demonstrate ultrathin optical
metasurfaces with large nonreciprocal response for free-space radiation based
on silicon third-order nonlinearities. Our metasurfaces combine an out-of-plane
asymmetry - necessary to obtain nonreciprocity - with in-plane broken symmetry,
which finely tunes the radiative linewidth of quasi-bound states in the
continuum (q-BICs). Third-order nonlinearities naturally occurring in silicon,
engaged by q-BICs, are shown to enable over 10 dB of nonreciprocal transmission
while maintaining less than 3 dB in insertion loss. The demonstrated devices
merge the field of nonreciprocity with ultrathin metasurface technologies,
offering an exciting functionality for signal processing and routing,
communications, and protection of high-power laser cavities.

the fabrication of very robust plasmonic gaps with sub-nanometre accuracy. Due
to the extreme field confinement, the size and shape of plasmonic nanocavities
dominate their optical response. But so far, the community has mainly focused
on idealized spherical nanoparticles, ignoring that during their synthesis
nanoparticles actually acquire polyhedral shapes, and that many different
geometries can be synthesised these days. Here, we provide a complete
description of the plasmonic modes in nanocavities made of three commonly
occurring polyhedral nanoparticles (cuboctahedron, rhombicuboctahedron,
decahedron). We show that the shape and symmetry of these plasmonic
nanocavities dominate both their near- and far-field response, with intricate

far-field emission profile is obtained for an emitter placed at various
nanocavity positions, which is crucial for understanding how energy couples in

light-matter interactions in extreme plasmonic environments for various
applications, such as photochemical reactions and non-linear vibrational

separates two classes of planets -- usually referred to as ""super-Earths"" and
""mini-Neptunes"" -- and its origin remains debated. One model proposes that
super-Earths are the outcome of photo-evaporation or core-powered mass-loss
stripping the primordial atmospheres of the mini-Neptunes. A contrasting model
interprets the radius valley as a dichotomy in the bulk compositions, where
super-Earths are rocky planets and mini-Neptunes are water-ice rich worlds. In
this work, we test whether the migration model is consistent with the radius
valley and how it distinguishes these views. In the migration model, planets
migrate towards the disk inner edge forming a chain of planets locked in
resonant configurations. After the gas disk dispersal, orbital instabilities
""break the chains"" and promote late collisions. This model broadly matches the
period-ratio and planet-multiplicity distributions of Kepler planets, and
accounts for resonant chains such as TRAPPIST-1, Kepler-223, and TOI-178. Here,
by combining the outcome of planet formation simulations with compositional
mass-radius relationships, and assuming complete loss of primordial H-rich
atmospheres in late giant-impacts, we show that the migration model accounts
for the exoplanet radius valley and the intra-system uniformity
(""peas-in-a-pod"") of Kepler planets. Our results suggest that planets with
sizes of $\sim$1.4 $R_{\oplus}$ are mostly rocky, whereas those with sizes of

There is an evidence that either the inner disk radius varied by $\sim25$ % or

distance to $10$ kpc and using a relativistic accretion disk model, constrained
the black hole mass to 6 M$_\odot$ and inclination angle to 72$^{\circ}$. A
positive correlation is detected between the accretion rate and inner radii or

Function interpolation. It focuses on certain central aspects, but does not try
to be exhaustive. The most important questions are: How does the error of a
kernel-based interpolant vary with the scale of the kernel chosen? How does the
standard error bound vary? And since fixed functions may be in spaces that
allow scalings, like global Sobolev spaces, is there a scale of the space that
matches the function best? The last question is answered in the affirmative for
Sobolev spaces, but the required scale may be hard to estimate. Scalability of
functions turns out to be restricted for spaces generated by analytic kernels,
unless the functions are band-limited. In contrast to other papers, polynomials
and polyharmonics are included as flat limits when checking scales
experimentally, with an independent computation. The numerical results show
that the hunt for near-flat scales is questionable, if users include the flat
limit cases right from the start. When there are not enough data to evaluate
errors directly, the scale of the standard error bound can be varied, up to
replacing the norm of the unknown function by the norm of the interpolant. This
follows the behavior of the actual error qualitatively well, but is only of
limited value for estimating error-optimal scales. For kernels and functions
with unlimited smoothness, the given interpolation data are proven to be
insufficient for determining useful scales.

tools, and we prove that it converges almost surely to the optimum. We then
study the convergence rate for when the objectives are additionally strongly

realizing quantum networking protocols like teleportation and entanglement
swapping. Measurement of the temporal auto-correlation function of the
unheralded signal or idler photons comprising the BFC is a key tool for
characterizing their spectral purity and in turn verifying the utility of the
biphoton state for networking protocols. Yet the experimentally obtainable
precision for measuring BFC correlation functions is often severely limited by
detector jitter. The fine temporal features in the correlation function$-$not
only of practical value in quantum information, but also of fundamental
interest in the study of quantum optics$-$are lost as a result and have
remained unexplored. We propose a scheme to circumvent this challenge through

the edge. We propose a novel approach for the detection of IoT device attacks
based on the use of formal modeling and mutation testing. Namely, we model the
behavior of small IoT devices such as motion sensors and RFID reader as state
machines with timeouts. We also model basic IoT attacks; namely, battery
draining, sleep deprivation, data falsification, replay, and man in the middle
attacks, as special mutants of these specifications. We also consider tests for
detecting actual physical device manipulation. Mutation testing is then used to
derive tests that distinguish these attacks from the original specifications.
The behavior of these mutants is tested in real environment by running the
tests on them. Our experiments show that derived the number of attack mutants
and tests is small and thus these tests can be executed many times with limited
overhead on the physical device. Consequently, our approach is not deterred by
related high costs of traditional mutation testing. In addition, we also show
that tests derived by our method which cover all IoT attacks do not provide
good coverage of mutants derived using traditional mutation code-based
operators and this indicates the need of using our method. A framework that
implements our approach is presented along with some other relevant case

pass from perfectly indistinguishable (bosonic behaviour), to perfectly
distinguishable (fermionic behavior), therefore demonstrating a mechanism for
how spacetime can affect quantum systems. The work is increasingly relevant in
the real world as we move towards global satellite quantum communications, and
paves the way for further fundamental research that could test the influence of
non-inertial motion (and equivalently curved spacetime) on quantum
entanglement.

computational ellipsometry approach based on a conventional tabletop optical

knowledge about the multilayer substrates, EllipsoNet can predict the complex
refractive indices of thin films on top of these nontrivial substrates from
experimentally measured optical reflectance spectra with high accuracies. This
task was not feasible previously with traditional reflectometry or ellipsometry

formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, and specific star formation rate (sSFR)
have implications for the impact of environment upon galaxy formation and
evolution. Conformity between primary galaxies and satellites within the same
dark matter halo has been well documented in simulations and observations.
However, the existence of conformity at greater distances - known as two-halo
conformity - remains uncertain. We investigate whether galaxies in the Local
Volume to a distance of 4 Mpc show conformity by examining SFR, sSFR, stellar
mass, and quenched fraction as a function of physical separation. Making use of
the star formation histories of these galaxies, we then extend this analysis
back in time to offer the first probe of conformity inside our past light cone.
At the present day, we find that the stellar mass or sSFR of a galaxy
correlates with the median SFR of neighboring galaxies at a separation of 2 to
3 Mpc. At a lookback time of 1 Gyr, we find a correlation with the quenched
fraction of neighboring galaxies, again at 2 to 3 Mpc separation. These signals
of conformity likely arise from the differences between the recent star
formation histories of Local Group dwarf galaxies and those outside the Local
Group. As current and future missions including JWST, Rubin, and Roman expand
the sample of Local Volume galaxies, tests of conformity using star formation
histories will provide an important tool for exploring spatio-temporal
correlations between galaxies.

often downsampled to a smaller size such that it can be stored, transmitted and
processed more efficiently without incurring significant performance
degradation. Traditional task-agnostic sampling methods, such as farthest point
sampling (FPS), do not consider downstream tasks when sampling point clouds,
and thus non-informative points to the tasks are often sampled. This paper
explores a task-oriented sampling for 3D point clouds, and aims to sample a
subset of points that are tailored specifically to a downstream task of
interest. Similar to FPS, we assume that point to be sampled next should depend
heavily on the points that have already been sampled. We thus formulate point
cloud sampling as a sequential generation process, and develop an
attention-based point cloud sampling network (APSNet) to tackle this problem.
At each time step, APSNet attends to all the points in a cloud by utilizing the
history of previously sampled points, and samples the most informative one.
Both supervised learning and knowledge distillation-based self-supervised
learning of APSNet are proposed. Moreover, joint training of APSNet over
multiple sample sizes is investigated, leading to a single APSNet that can
generate arbitrary length of samples with prominent performances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of APSNet against
state-of-the-arts in various downstream tasks, including 3D point cloud
classification, reconstruction, and registration.

not find a crossover from insulating to metallic behavior at low temperatures
above $p_{{\rm c}}$. Instead, the metal-insulator transition temperature, which
tracks the decrease in the AIAO ordering temperature for pressures up to 30
kbar, begins to increase under further application of pressure, pointing to the
presence of an as-yet unidentified localization mechanism. The magnetotransport
does track the suppression of Ir magnetism, however, with a strong hysteresis
observed only within the AIAO phase boundary, similar to that found for
Ho$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ and attributed to plastic deformation of Ir domains. Around
$p_{{\rm c}}$ we find the emergence of a new type of electronic behavior,
characterized by a negative magnetoresistance with small hysteresis at the
lowest temperatures, and hysteresis-free positive magnetoresistance above 5 K.
A Weyl semimetal phase is predicted to occur in the vicinity of the QCP. The

vertices independently switch from vacant to occupied at rate $1$ (initially
they are all vacant), and any connected component ""is burnt"" (its vertices
become instantaneously vacant) as soon as its cardinality crosses a (typically
large) threshold $N$, the parameter of the model.
  Our analysis provides a detailed description, as $N \to \infty$, of the
process near and beyond the critical time $t_c$ (at which an infinite cluster
would arise in the absence of fires). In particular we prove a somewhat
counterintuitive result: there exists $\delta > 0$ such that with high
probability, the origin does not burn before time $t_c + \delta$. This provides
a negative answer to Open Problem 4.1 of van den Berg and Brouwer [Comm. Math.
Phys., 2006]. Informally speaking, the result can be explained in terms of the
emergence of fire lanes, whose total density is negligible (as $N \to \infty$),
but which nevertheless are sufficiently robust with respect to recoveries. We
expect that such a behavior also holds for the classical Drossel-Schwabl model.
  A large part of this paper is devoted to analyzing recoveries during the
interval $[t_c, t_c + \delta]$. These recoveries do have a ""microscopic""
effect, but it turns out that their combined influence on macroscopic scales
(and in fact on relevant ""mesoscopic"" scales) vanishes as $N \to \infty$.
  In order to prove this, we use key ideas of Kiss, Manolescu and Sidoravicius
[Ann. Probab., 2015], introducing a suitable induction argument to extend and
strengthen their results. We then use it to prove that a deconcentration result
in our earlier joint work with Kiss on volume-frozen percolation also holds for
the forest fire process. As we explain, significant additional difficulties
arise here, since recoveries destroy the nice spatial Markov property of frozen
percolation.

  formalism","14 pages, 5 figures; v2: misprints corrected, discussions extended",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We suggest the existence of systems in which the statistics of a particle
changes with the quantum level it occupies. The occupation numbers in thermal
equilibrium depend on a continuous statistical parameter that interpolates
between bosonic or fermionic and ghost-like statistical distributions. We call
such particle states ``ninions'': they are different from anyons and can exist
in 3+1 dimensions. We suggest that ninions can be associated with coherent
angular momentum states. In the Euclidean imaginary-time formalism, the
ninionic statistics can be implemented via the rotwisted boundary conditions,
which are associated with the rigid global rotation of the system with an
imaginary angular frequency. The imaginary rotation is characterized by a
PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and possesses a well-defined
thermodynamic limit. The physics of ninions in thermal equilibrium is
accessible for numerical simulations on Euclidean lattices. We provide a no-go
theorem on the absence of analytical continuation between real and imaginary
rotations in the thermodynamic limit. The ground state of ninions shares
similarity with the $\theta$-vacuum in QCD. The ninions can produce negative
pressure and energy, similar to the Casimir effect and the cosmological dark
energy. In the thermodynamic limit, the dependence of thermal energy of free
ninions on the statistical parameter is a fractal.

to a set of target fermionic operators and to a target hardware connectivity.
Our method uses brute force search, over the space of all encodings which map
from Majorana monomials to Pauli operators, to find an encoding which optimizes
a target cost function. In contrast to earlier works in this direction, our
method searches over an extremely broad class of encodings which subsumes all
known second quantized encodings that constitute algebra homomorphisms. In
order to search over this class, we give a clear mathematical explanation of
how precisely it is characterized, and how to translate this characterization
into constructive search criteria. A benefit of searching over this class is
that our method is able to supply fairly general optimality guarantees on
solutions. A second benefit is that our method is, in principal, capable of
finding more efficient representations of fermionic systems when the set of
fermionic operators under consideration are faithfully represented by a smaller
quotient algebra. Given the high algorithmic cost of performing the search, we
adapt our method to handle translationally invariant systems that can be
described by a small unit cell that is less costly. We demonstrate our method
on various pairings of target fermionic operators and hardware connectivities.
We additionally show how our method can be extended to find error detecting
fermionic encodings in this class.

properties such as excellent strength retention at elevated temperatures have
been attracting increasing attention. Although their inherent chemical
complexity is considered a defining feature, a challenge arises in predicting
local chemical ordering, particularly in grain boundary regions with enhanced
structural disorder. In this study, we use atomistic simulations of a large
group of bicrystal models to sample a wide variety of interfacial sites (grain
boundary) in NbMoTaW and explore emergent trends in interfacial segregation and
the underlying structural and chemical driving factors. Sampling hundreds of
bicrystals along the [001] symmetric tilt axis and analyzing more than one
hundred and thirty thousand grain boundary sites with a variety of local atomic
environments, we uncover segregation trends in NbMoTaW. While Nb is the
dominant segregant, more notable are the segregation patterns that deviate from
expected behavior and mark situations where local structural and chemical
driving forces lead to interesting segregation events. For example, incomplete
depletion of Ta in low-angle boundaries results from chemical pinning due to
favorable local compositional environments associated with chemical short-range
ordering. Finally, machine learning models capturing and comparing the
structural and chemical features of interfacial sites are developed to weigh
their relative importance and contributions to segregation tendency, revealing
a significant increase in predictive capability when including local chemical
information. Overall, this work, highlighting the complex interplay between
local grain boundary structure and chemical short-range ordering, suggest
tunable segregation and chemical ordering by tailoring grain boundary structure

relevant at low frequencies, when the wavelength is comparable to the
characteristic lensing time delay multiplied by the speed of light, and are
thus often negligible for electromagnetic signals. Accurate predictions require
computing the conditionally convergent diffraction integral, which involves
highly oscillatory integrands and is numerically difficult. We develop and
implement several methods to compute lensing predictions in the WO regime valid
for general gravitational lenses. First, we derive approximations for high and
low frequencies, obtaining explicit expressions for several analytic lens
models. Next, we discuss two numerical methods suitable in the intermediate
frequency range: 1) Regularized contour flow yields accurate answers in a
fraction of a second for a broad range of frequencies. 2) Complex deformation
is slower, but requires no knowledge of solutions to the geometric lens
equation. Both methods are independent and complement each other. We verify
sub-percent accuracy for several lens models, which should be sufficient for
applications to GW astronomy in the near future. Apart from modelling lensed
GWs, our method will also be applicable to the study of plasma lensing of radio

Here, our characterizations of the regret distribution complement the
characterizations of the tail of the regret distribution recently developed by
Fan and Glynn (2021) (arXiv:2109.13595). The tail characterizations there are
associated with atypical bandit behavior on trajectories where the optimal arm
mean is under-estimated, leading to mis-identification of the optimal arm and
large regret. In contrast, our SLLN's and CLT's here describe the typical
behavior and fluctuation of regret on trajectories where the optimal arm mean
is properly estimated. We find that Thompson sampling and UCB satisfy the same
SLLN and CLT, with the asymptotics of both the SLLN and the (mean) centering
sequence in the CLT matching the asymptotics of expected regret. Both the mean
and variance in the CLT grow at $\log(T)$ rates with the time horizon $T$.
Asymptotically as $T \to \infty$, the variability in the number of plays of
each sub-optimal arm depends only on the rewards received for that arm, which
indicates that each sub-optimal arm contributes independently to the overall
CLT variance.

relevant information in an automatic manner without explicit queries. As
recommender systems evolve, increasingly sophisticated learning techniques are
applied and have achieved better performance in terms of user engagement
metrics such as clicks and browsing time. The increase of the measured
performance, however, can have two possible attributions: a better
understanding of user preferences, and a more proactive ability to utilize
human bounded rationality to seduce user over-consumption. A natural following
question is whether current recommendation algorithms are manipulating user
preferences. If so, can we measure the manipulation level? In this paper, we
present a general framework for benchmarking the degree of manipulations of
recommendation algorithms, in both slate recommendation and sequential
recommendation scenarios. The framework consists of three stages, initial
preference calculation, algorithm training and interaction, and metrics
calculation that involves two proposed metrics, Manipulation Score and
Preference Shift. We benchmark some representative recommendation algorithms in
both synthetic and real-world datasets under the proposed framework. We have
observed that a high online click-through rate does not mean a better
understanding of user initial preference, but ends in prompting users to choose
more documents they initially did not favor. Moreover, we find that the
properties of training data have notable impacts on the manipulation degrees,
and algorithms with more powerful modeling abilities are more sensitive to such
impacts. The experiments also verified the usefulness of the proposed metrics
for measuring the degree of manipulations. We advocate that future
recommendation algorithm studies should be treated as an optimization problem
with constrained user preference manipulations.

handle long-term forecasting horizon, we present a temporal cascaded diffusion
model. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on four publicly available
datasets (Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, AMASS, and 3DPW), outperforming the
state-of-the-art. Additionally, we show that our framework is generic enough to
improve any 3D pose prediction model as a pre-processing step to repair their

neutron star-black hole binaries appear to indicate that massive neutron stars
may not be too uncommon in merging systems. In this manuscript, we present a
first set of evolution of massive neutron star binaries using Monte-Carlo
radiation transport for the evolution of neutrinos. We study a range of
systems, from nearly symmetric binaries that collapse to a black hole before
forming a disk or ejecting material, to more asymmetric binaries in which tidal
disruption of the lower mass star leads to the production of more interesting
post-merger remnants. For the latter type of systems, we additionally study the
impact of viscosity on the properties of the outflows, and compare our results
to two recent simulations of identical binaries performed with the WhiskyTHC
code. We find agreement on the black hole properties, disk mass, and mass and
velocity of the outflows within expected numerical uncertainties, and some
minor but noticeable differences in the evolution of the electron fraction when
using a subgrid viscosity model, with viscosity playing a more minor role in
our simulations. The method used to account for r-process heating in the
determination of the outflow properties appears to have a larger impact on our
result than those differences between numerical codes. We also use the
simulation with the most ejected material to verify that our newly implemented
Lagrangian tracers provide a reasonable sampling of the matter outflows as they
leave the computational grid. We note that, given the lack of production of hot
outflows in these mergers, the main role of neutrinos in these systems is to
set the composition of the post-merger remnant. One of the main potential use
of our simulations is thus as improved initial conditions for longer evolutions
of such remnants.

that an absorbed power-law model provided the best fit overall. Over the course

$2\times10^{-12}$ to below $10^{-13}{\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$ and the
spectrum softened, with the photon index going from $\Gamma\approx1.6$ to
$\Gamma\approx2.6$. We interpret the spectral softening as reprocessed emission
from the accretion disk edge coming into view while the pulsar was obscured by
the possibly precessing disk. Some spectral fits were significantly improved by
the inclusion of a disk blackbody component, and we surmise that this could be
due to the pulsar emerging in between obscuration episodes by partial covering
absorbers. We posit that we observed a low-flux state of the system (due to
line-of-sight absorption) punctuated by the occasional appearance of the

accretion disk precession timescales.

halo which may be attributed to the last major merger. When stellar material
from a satellite is accreted onto its host, it phase mixes and appears finely
substructured in phase space. For a high-eccentricity merger, this substructure
most clearly manifests as numerous wrapping chevrons in $(v_r, r)$ space,
corresponding to stripes in $(E, \theta_r)$ space. We introduce the idea of
using this substructure as an alternative subhalo detector to cold stellar
streams. We simulate an N-body merger akin to the GSE and assess the impact of
subhaloes on these chevrons. We examine how their deformation depends on the
mass, pericentre, and number of subhaloes. To quantify the impact of
perturbers, we utilise the appearance of chevrons in $(E, \theta_r)$ space to
introduce a new quantity -- the ironing parameter. We show that: (1) a single
flyby of a massive ($\sim 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) subhalo with pericentre
comparable to, or within, the shell's apocentre smooths out the substructure,
(2) a single flyby of a low mass ($\lesssim 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$) has negligible
effect, (3) multiple flybys of subhalos derived from a subhalo mass function
between $10^7-10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ cause significant damage if deep within the
potential, (4) the effects of known perturbers (e.g. Sagittarius) should be
detectable and offer constraints on their initial mass. The sensitivity to the
populations of subhaloes suggests that we should be able to place an upper
limit on the Milky Way's subhalo mass function.

$\Sigma_{gas}$ from $\tau_V$, metallicity and the dust-to-metal ratio, at any

Dust polarization is important for both our understanding of astrophysical

gravitational waves in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In the diffuse
ISM, H I is strongly correlated with the dust and partly organized into
filaments that are aligned with the local magnetic field. We analyze the deep
BICEP/Keck data at 95, 150, and 220 GHz, over the low-column-density region of
sky where BICEP/Keck has set the best limits on primordial gravitational waves.
We separate the H I emission into distinct velocity components and detect dust
polarization correlated with the local Galactic H I but not with the H I
associated with Magellanic Stream I. We present a robust, multifrequency
detection of polarized dust emission correlated with the filamentary H I
morphology template down to 95 GHz. For assessing its utility for foreground
cleaning, we report that the H I morphology template correlates in B modes at a
$\sim$10-65$\%$ level over the multipole range $20 < \ell < 200$ with the
BICEP/Keck maps, which contain contributions from dust, CMB, and noise
components. We measure the spectral index of the filamentary dust component

for decorrelation in this region between the filaments and the rest of the dust
field or from the inclusion of dust associated with the intermediate velocity H
I. Finally, we explore the morphological parameter space in the H I-based

association of solar activity and cosmic radiation over five solar cycles, from
1965 to 2020, using a collection of multichannel data from neutron monitors,

debated in the literature and all formation scenarios proposed so far require
some level of fine-tuning. The detailed star formation histories (SFHs) of
these systems may represent an important piece of information to assess their
origin. Here we present the first attempt to perform such an analysis for
Liller 1. The first key result we find is that Liller 1 has been forming stars
over its entire lifetime. More specifically, three broad SF episodes are
clearly detected: 1) a dominant one, occurred some 12-13 Gyr ago with a tail
extending for up to $\sim3$ Gyr, 2) an intermediate burst, between 6 and 9 Gyr
ago, 3) and a recent one, occurred between 1 and 3 Gyr ago. The old population
contributes to about $70\%$ of the total stellar mass and the remaining
fraction is almost equally split between the intermediate and young
populations. If we take these results at a face value, they would suggest that
this system unlikely formed through the merger between an old globular cluster
and a Giant Molecular Cloud, as recently proposed. On the contrary, our
findings provide further support to the idea that Liller 1 is the surviving
relic of a massive primordial structure that contributed to the Galactic bulge
formation, similarly to the giant clumps observed in star-forming high-redshift

Observatory (SKAO) as a benchmark for future cosmological surveys at radio
frequencies, combining a continuum survey for weak lensing and angular galaxy
clustering with an HI galaxy survey for spectroscopic galaxy clustering that
can detect baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift space distortions.
Moreover, we also add 21cm HI intensity mapping, which provides invaluable
information at higher redshifts, and can complement tomographic resolution,
thus allowing us to probe redshift-dependent deviations of modified gravity
models. For some of these cases, we combine the probes with other optical
surveys, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Vera
C. Rubin Observatory (VRO). We show that such synergies are powerful tools to
remove systematic effects and degeneracies in the non-linear and small-scale
modelling of the observables. Overall, we find that the combination of all SKAO
radio probes will have the ability to constrain the present value of the
functions parameterising deviations from $\Lambda$CDM ($\mu$ and $\Sigma$) with
a precision of $2.7\%$ and $1.8\%$ respectively, competitive with the
constraints expected from optical surveys and with constraints we have on
gravitational interactions in the standard model. Exploring the radio-optical
synergies, we find that the combination of VRO with SKAO can yield extremely
tight constraints on $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ ($0.9\%$ and $0.7\%$ respectively),

few-shot transfer across languages by learning and reusing language-agnostic
features. However, as a fixed-size model acquires more languages, its
performance across all languages degrades, a phenomenon termed interference.
Often attributed to limited model capacity, interference is commonly addressed
by adding additional parameters despite evidence that transformer-based models
are overparameterized. In this work, we show that it is possible to reduce
interference by instead identifying and pruning language-specific parameters.
First, we use Shapley Values, a credit allocation metric from coalitional game
theory, to identify attention heads that introduce interference. Then, we show
that removing identified attention heads from a fixed model improves
performance for a target language on both sentence classification and
structural prediction, seeing gains as large as 24.7\%. Finally, we provide
insights on language-agnostic and language-specific attention heads using
attention visualization.

VLMaps, a spatial map representation that directly fuses pretrained
visual-language features with a 3D reconstruction of the physical world. VLMaps
can be autonomously built from video feed on robots using standard exploration
approaches and enables natural language indexing of the map without additional
labeled data. Specifically, when combined with large language models (LLMs),
VLMaps can be used to (i) translate natural language commands into a sequence
of open-vocabulary navigation goals (which, beyond prior work, can be spatial
by construction, e.g., ""in between the sofa and TV"" or ""three meters to the
right of the chair"") directly localized in the map, and (ii) can be shared
among multiple robots with different embodiments to generate new obstacle maps
on-the-fly (by using a list of obstacle categories). Extensive experiments
carried out in simulated and real world environments show that VLMaps enable
navigation according to more complex language instructions than existing

intermediate messenger between the inflaton, the dark sector and the Standard

dark matter (DM), the baryon asymmetry through leptogenesis, as well as a
sufficiently hot thermal bath after inflation. We assume an inflaton potential
of the form $V(\phi)\propto \phi^k$ about the minimum at the end of inflation.
The possibility of reheating via minimal gravitational interactions has been
excluded by constraints on dark radiation for excessive gravitational waves
produced from inflation. We thus extend the minimal model in several ways: i)
we consider non-minimal gravitational couplings--this points to the parameter
range of DM masses $M_{N_1} \simeq 2-10 $ PeV, and right-handed neutrino masses
$M_{N_2} \simeq (5-20) \times 10^{11}$ GeV, and $T_\text{rh} \lesssim 3 \times
10^5$ GeV (for $k \le 20$); ii) we propose an explanation for the PeV excess
observed by IceCube when the DM has a direct but small Yukawa coupling to the
SM; and iii) we also propose a novel scenario, where the gravitational
production of DM is a two-step process, first through the production of two
scalars, which then decay to fermionic DM final states. In this case, the
absence of a helicity suppression enhances the production of DM and baryon
asymmetry, and allows a great range for the parameters including a dark matter
mass below an MeV where dark matter warmness can be observable by cosmic 21-cm
lines, even when gravitational interactions are responsible for reheating. We
also show that detectable primordial gravitational wave signals provide the
opportunity to probe this scenario for $T_\text{rh}\lesssim 5\times 10^6$ GeV

Probability Function (VPF) clustering can give for the Lyman-Alpha Galaxies in

Neutral hydrogen acts like a fog for Lyman-alpha emission, and measuring the
drop in the luminosity function of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) has been used
to constrain the ionization fraction in narrowband surveys. However, the
clustering of LAEs is independent from the luminosity function's inherent
evolution, and can offer additional constraints for reionization under
different models. The VPF measures how likely a given circle is to be empty. It
is a volume-averaged clustering statistic that traces the behavior of higher
order correlations, and its simplicity offers helpful frameworks for planning
surveys.
  Using the \citet{Jensen2014} simulations of LAEs within various amount of
ionized intergalactic medium, we predict the behavior of the VPF in one
(301x150.5x30 Mpc$^3$), four (5.44$\times 10^6$ Mpc$^3$), or eight (1.1$\times
10^7$ Mpc$^3$) fields of LAGER imaging. We examine the VPF at 5 and 13
arcminutes, corresponding to the minimum scale implied by the LAE density and
the separation of the 2D VPF from random, and the maximum scale from the
8-field 15.5 deg$^2$ LAGER area. We find that even a single DECam field of
LAGER (2-3 deg$^2$) could discriminate between mostly neutral vs. ionized.

percent ionized; and that eight fields could even distinguish between 30, 50,
73, and 95 percent ionized.

information coming from different sources. It is often implicitly assumed in
such contexts that vectors encode epistemic states, i.e. that vectors capture
the evidence that has been obtained about some properties of interest, and that
pooling these vectors yields a vector that combines this evidence. We study,
for a number of standard pooling operators, under what conditions they are
compatible with this idea, which we call the epistemic pooling principle. While
we find that all the considered pooling operators can satisfy the epistemic
pooling principle, this only holds when embeddings are sufficiently
high-dimensional and, for most pooling operators, when the embeddings satisfy
particular constraints (e.g. having non-negative coordinates). We then study
the implications of these constraints, starting from the idea that we should be
able to verify whether an arbitrary propositional formula is satisfied in the
epistemic state encoded by a given vector. We find that when the epistemic
pooling principle is satisfied, in most cases it is impossible to verify the
satisfaction of propositional formulas using linear scoring functions, with two
exceptions: (i) max-pooling with embeddings that are upper-bounded and (ii)
Hadamard pooling with non-negative embeddings. Finally, we also study an
extension of the epistemic pooling principle to weighted epistemic states,
where max-pooling emerges as the most suitable operator.

Msun is unclear. They could evolve to form white dwarfs or explode as
electron-capture supernovae (SNe) or iron core-collapse SNe (CCSNe). Even
though the initial mass function indicates that this mass range should account
for over 40% of all CCSNe progenitors, few have been observationally confirmed,
likely owing to the faintness and rapid evolution of these transients. In this
paper, we present a sample of nine Ca-rich/O-poor Type IIb SNe detected by the
Zwicky Transient Facility with progenitors likely in this mass range. We
perform a holistic analysis of the spectroscopic and photometric properties of
the sample. These sources have a flux ratio of [Ca II] $\lambda \lambda$7291,
7324 to [O I] $\lambda \lambda$6300, 6364 of $\gtrsim$ 2 in their nebular
spectra. Comparing the measured [O I] luminosity ($\lesssim 10^{39}
\mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}$) and derived oxygen mass ($\lesssim 0.1$ Msun) with
theoretical models, we infer that the progenitor ZAMS mass for these explosions
is less than 12 Msun. These correspond to He-stars with core masses less than
around 3 Msun. We find that the ejecta properties (Mej $\lesssim 1$ Msun) are
also consistent with those expected for such low mass He-stars. The low ejecta
mass of these sources indicates a class of strongly-stripped SNe that is a
transition between the regular stripped-envelope SNe and ultra-stripped SNe.
The progenitor could be stripped by a main sequence companion and result in the
formation of a neutron star $-$ main sequence binary. Such binaries have been
suggested to be progenitors of neutron star $-$ white dwarf systems that could
merge within a Hubble time, and be detectable with LISA.

most outstanding phenomena in mathematical physics, that of universality. While
this classical result is well understood it is still not very clear what
happens to this universal behaviour when the random variables become
correlated. A fruitful mathematically laboratory to investigate the rising of
new universal properties is offered by the set of eigenvalues of random
matrices. In this regard a lot of work has been done using the standard random
matrix ensembles and focusing on the distribution of extreme eigenvalues. In
this case, the distribution of the largest -- or smallest -- eigenvalue departs
from the Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem yielding the celebrated Tracy-Widom
distribution. One may wonder, yet again, how robust is this new universal
behaviour captured by the Tracy-Widom distribution when the correlation among
eigenvalues changes. Few answers have been provided to this poignant question
and our intention in the present work is to contribute to this interesting
unexplored territory. Thus, we study numerically the probability distribution
for the normalized largest eigenvalue of the interacting $k$-body fermionic
orthogonal and unitary Embedded Gaussian Ensembles in the diluted limit. We
find a smooth transition from a slightly asymmetric Gaussian-like distribution,
for small $k/m$, to the Tracy-Widom distribution as $k/m\to 1$, where $k$ is
the rank of the interaction and $m$ is the number of fermions. Correlations at
the edge of the spectrum are stronger for small values of $k/m$, and are
independent of the number of particles considered. Our results indicate that
subtle correlations towards the edge of the spectrum distinguish the
statistical properties of the spectrum of interacting many-body systems in the
dilute limit, from those expected for the standard random matrix ensembles.

perturbed periodic operators. Yet, a systematic treatise was hitherto missing.
While many of the results can be found piecemeal in appendices and as sketches
in other articles, this article does contain new results. For instance, we have
established Beals-type commutator criteria for both cases, which then imply the
existence of Moyal resolvents for (equivariant) selfadjoint-operator-valued,
elliptic H\""ormander symbols and allows one to construct functional calculi.
What is more, we give criteria on the function under which a magnetic
pseudodifferential operator is (locally) trace class. Our aims for this article
are three-fold: (1) Create a single, solid work that colleagues can refer to.
(2) Be pedagogical and precise. And (3) give a straightforward strategy for
extending results from the operator-valued to the equivariant case, pointing
out some caveats and pitfalls that need to be kept in mind.

tilt angle in this work using a quasi-2D monolayer of grains in a silo. We
measure mass flow rate, the average exit velocities of grains, and the packing

describes our results (and earlier findings with 3D systems [H. G. Sheldon and

dynamics of nonlinear shallow arches while switching from one state to another
state for different loading cases. We study an elastic arch subject to static
loading and time-dependent loading separately. In particular, we consider a
time-dependent loading that evolves linearly with time at a constant rate. In
both cases, we observed that the switching does not occur abruptly when the
load exceeds the static switching load, rather the time scale of the dynamics
drastically slows down; hence there is a delay in switching. For
time-independent loading, this delay increases as the applied load approach the
static switching load. Whereas for a time-dependent loading, the delay is
proportional to the rate of the applied load. Other than the loading
parameters, the delay switching time also depends on the local curvature of the
force-displacement function at the static switching point and the damping
coefficient of the arch material. The delay switching occurs due to the
flatness of the energy curve at static switching load. Therefore, we linearize
the arch near the static switching point and get a reduced nonlinear ordinary
differential equation to study the switching dynamics of the arch. This reduced
equation allows us to derive analytical expressions for the delay switching
time of the. We further compare the derived analytical results with the
numerical solutions and observed a good agreement between them. Finally, the
derived analytical formulae can be used to design arches for self-offloading

  of paper fibre networks","26 pages, 16 figures",,"10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2022.111990",,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In fibrous paper materials, an exposure to a variation in moisture content
causes changes in the geometrical and mechanical properties. Such changes are
strongly affected by the inter-fibre bonds, which are responsible for the
transfer of the hygro-mechanical response from one fibre to its neighbours in
the network, resulting in sheet-scale deformation. Most models developed in
literature assume perfect bonding between fibres. In the 3D reality, there is
some flexibility in the bond region, even for the perfectly bonded fibres,
because of the possibility of deformation gradients through the fibre
thickness. In earlier 2D idealizations, perfectly bonded fibres were assumed,
implying full kinematic constraint through the entire thickness of the sheet.
The purpose of the present study is to assess the effect of this assumption.
Using a homogenization approach, a random network of fibres is generated with
different coverages and modelled using finite elements. In order to understand
the role of bonding between fibres on the hygro-expansive behaviour of a
network, a bond model is developed. In this model, the fibres are modelled
using 2D regular bulk finite elements and the bonds are represented by
interfacial elements of finite stiffness, which are introduced between each
pair of fibres bonded in the network. These embedded interfacial elements form
a connection between two respective fibres, allowing relative displacements
between their mid-planes. The hygro-elastic response of networks obtained with
this bond model is investigated by varying the bond stiffness and the network
coverage under the application of mechanical loading and changes in moisture
content. Furthermore, the bond model is used to analyse the influence of
inter-fibre bonds on the anisotropic response of the paper fibre network.

they possess various perception sensors that can predict road surface
conditions and other phenomena ahead of time. Many modern automotive control
systems treat the road slope as a constant and do not account for changes in
the road profile in their vehicle models. As a result, vehicle states may be
miscalculated, which, in the worst-case scenario, may result in accidents. This
is particularly true for high center-of-gravity vehicles like trailers and
delivery trucks. With the help of perception sensors in autonomous vehicles, a
road slope estimation system can be developed to aid these control systems in

have emerged as a better alternative to traditional convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) for computer vision tasks. However, our understanding of how
the new architecture works is still limited. In this paper, we focus on the
phenomenon that Transformers show higher robustness against corruptions than
CNNs, while not being overconfident (in fact, we find Transformers are actually
underconfident). This is contrary to the intuition that robustness increases
with confidence. We resolve this contradiction by investigating how the output
of the penultimate layer moves in the representation space as the input data
moves within a small area. In particular, we show the following. (1) While CNNs
exhibit fairly linear relationship between the input and output movements,
Transformers show nonlinear relationship for some data. For those data, the
output of Transformers moves in a curved trajectory as the input moves
linearly. (2) When a data is located in a curved region, it is hard to move it
out of the decision region since the output moves along a curved trajectory
instead of a straight line to the decision boundary, resulting in high
robustness of Transformers. (3) If a data is slightly modified to jump out of
the curved region, the movements afterwards become linear and the output goes
to the decision boundary directly. Thus, Transformers can be attacked easily
after a small random jump and the perturbation in the final attacked data
remains imperceptible, i.e., there does exist a decision boundary near the
data. This also explains the underconfident prediction of Transformers. (4) The
curved regions in the representation space start to form at an early training
stage and grow throughout the training course. Some data are trapped in the
regions, obstructing Transformers from reducing the training loss.

challenge, evidenced by the effort invested at large-scale national

cavities for strong shock generation at a tabletop scale. The key idea is to
utilize multiple laser pulses spatially and temporally shaped to form
concentric laser rings on condensed matter samples. Each laser ring launches a
2D focusing pressure wave that converges at a common central point. The pulses
are delayed in the nanosecond range and spaced by microns, matching the laser
scanning speed to the shock wave speed, typically several \textmu m/ns in
condensed matter, allowing amplification of the pressure waves through
superposition. The herein-described optical cavities are expected to maintain
or even exceed the shock excitation efficiency of $10^4$ GPa/J reported in our
previous work using a single laser ring, where the limiting factor in
generating stronger shocks was the saturation of input laser energy. The
current design for multiple laser rings bypasses the saturation due to much
larger excitation areas; thus, the total input laser energy can be dramatically
increased. We further experimentally show that dielectric metasurfaces can
combine all optics for forming the required clean high-fluence laser rings in a

  Repurposing of Similar Tasks",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Most existing works on continual learning (CL) focus on overcoming the
catastrophic forgetting (CF) problem, with dynamic models and replay methods
performing exceptionally well. However, since current works tend to assume
exclusivity or dissimilarity among learning tasks, these methods require
constantly accumulating task-specific knowledge in memory for each task. This
results in the eventual prohibitive expansion of the knowledge repository if we
consider learning from a long sequence of tasks. In this work, we introduce a
paradigm where the continual learner gets a sequence of mixed similar and
dissimilar tasks. We propose a new continual learning framework that uses a
task similarity detection function that does not require additional learning,
with which we analyze whether there is a specific task in the past that is
similar to the current task. We can then reuse previous task knowledge to slow
down parameter expansion, ensuring that the CL system expands the knowledge
repository sublinearly to the number of learned tasks. Our experiments show
that the proposed framework performs competitively on widely used computer
vision benchmarks such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and EMNIST.

'optimal' doping for superconductivity with a characteristic dome-like
behaviour resembling systems close to a quantum critical point. Several
mechanisms have been proposed to link these phenomena, but the abundance of
undetermined parameters prevents a definite assessment. Here, we use ab initio
computations supplemented with a microscopic model to study the linear coupling
between conduction electrons and the ferroelectric soft transverse modes
allowed in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. We find a robust Rashba-like
coupling, which can become surprisingly strong for particular forms of the
polar eigenvector. We characterize this sensitivity for general eigenvectors
and, for the particular form deduced by hyper-Raman scattering experiments, we
find a BCS pairing coupling constant of the right order of magnitude to support
superconductivity. The ab initio computations enable us to go beyond the
linear-in-momentum conventional Rashba-like interaction and naturally explain
the dome behaviour including a characteristic asymmetry. The dome is attributed
to a momentum dependent quenching of the angular momentum due to a competition
between spin-orbit and hopping energies. The optimum density for having maximum
Tc results in rather good agreement with experiments without free parameters.
These results make the generalized Rashba dynamic coupling to the ferroelectric
soft mode a compelling pairing mechanism to understand bulk superconductivity
in doped SrTiO3.

approach is developed, based on block operator methods, for obtaining solutions
of the Z-problem, formulas for the effective operator in terms of the Schur
complement, and associated variational principles (e.g., the Dirichlet and
Thomson minimization principles) that lead to upper and lower bounds on the
effective operator. In the case of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, this
allows for a relaxation of the standard hypotheses on positivity and
invertibility for the classes of operators usually considered in such problems,
by replacing inverses with the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. As we develop the
theory, we show how it applies to the classical example from the theory of
composites on the effective conductivity in the periodic conductivity problem
in the continuum (2d and 3d) under the standard hypotheses. After that, we

electrical network problems in which our theory applies under the relaxed

computer-aided diagnosis, in which breast ultrasound (BUS) imaging is a common
and frequently used screening tool. Recently, a number of deep learning-based
methods have been proposed for joint localization and classification of breast
lesions using BUS images. In these methods, features extracted by a shared
network trunk are appended by two independent network branches to achieve
classification and localization. Improper information sharing might cause
conflicts in feature optimization in the two branches and leads to performance
degradation. Also, these methods generally require large amounts of pixel-level
annotated data for model training. To overcome these limitations, we proposed a
novel joint localization and classification model based on the attention
mechanism and disentangled semi-supervised learning strategy. The model used in
this study is composed of a classification network and an auxiliary
lesion-aware network. By use of the attention mechanism, the auxiliary
lesion-aware network can optimize multi-scale intermediate feature maps and
extract rich semantic information to improve classification and localization
performance. The disentangled semi-supervised learning strategy only requires
incomplete training datasets for model training. The proposed modularized
framework allows flexible network replacement to be generalized for various
applications. Experimental results on two different breast ultrasound image
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The impacts of
various network factors on model performance are also investigated to gain deep
insights into the designed framework.

young, dusty ($A_{V} = 5 - 15$), and massive ($10^{5.8} < M_{\odot} <

the `overlap' region between the two nuclei, quadruples the number of $t < 3$
Myr clusters, and nearly doubles the number of $t < 6$ Myr clusters detected in
VV 114. Now extending the cluster age distribution ($dN/d\tau \propto
\tau^{\gamma}$) to the youngest ages, we find a slope of $\gamma = -1.30 \pm
0.39$ for $10^{6} < \tau (\mathrm{yr}) < 10^{7}$, which is consistent with the
previously determined value from $10^{7} < \tau (\mathrm{yr}) < 10^{8.5}$, and
confirms that VV 114 has a steep age distribution slope for all massive star
clusters across the entire range of cluster ages observed. Finally, the
consistency between our {\it JWST}- and {\it HST}-derived age distribution

through the centralized learning mechanism, lacking adaptability to changes
like robot malfunction. To solve this limitation, this work treats each finger
as an individual agent and trains multiple agents to control their assigned
fingers to complete the in-hand manipulation task cooperatively. We propose the
Multi-Agent Global-Observation Critic and Local-Observation Actor (MAGCLA)
method, where the critic can observe all agents' actions globally, and the
actor only locally observes its neighbors' actions. Besides, conventional
individual experience replay may cause unstable cooperation due to the
asynchronous performance increment of each agent, which is critical for in-hand
manipulation tasks. To solve this issue, we propose the Synchronized Hindsight
Experience Replay (SHER) method to synchronize and efficiently reuse the
replayed experience across all agents. The methods are evaluated in two in-hand
manipulation tasks on the Shadow dexterous hand. The results show that SHER
helps MAGCLA achieve comparable learning efficiency to a single policy, and the
MAGCLA approach is more generalizable in different tasks. The trained policies
have higher adaptability in the robot malfunction test compared to the baseline
multi-agent and single-agent approaches.

area. The first is the need for efficient exploitation/exploration trade-off in
sample selection in AL. For this, we present an innovative integration of
recent progress in both uncertainty-based and geometric frameworks to enable an
efficient exploration/exploitation trade-off in sample selection strategy. To
this end, we build on a computationally efficient approximate of Thompson
sampling with key changes as a posterior estimator for uncertainty
representation. Our framework provides two advantages: (1) accurate posterior
estimation, and (2) tune-able trade-off between computational overhead and
higher accuracy. The second problem is the need for improved training protocols
in deep AL. For this, we use ideas from semi/self supervised learning to
propose a general approach that is independent of the specific AL technique
being used. Taken these together, our framework shows a significant improvement
over the state-of-the-art, with results that are comparable to the performance
of supervised-learning under the same setting. We show empirical results of our
framework, and comparative performance with the state-of-the-art on four
datasets, namely, MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet to establish a new
baseline in two different settings.

both fermionic- (FEB) and qubit-excitation-based (QEB) singles and doubles and
illustrated their usefulness in adaptive derivative-assembled
pseudo-Trotterized variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) simulations. In
this work, we extend these CNOT-efficient quantum circuits to arbitrary
excitation ranks. To illustrate the benefits of these compact FEB and QEB
quantum circuits, we perform numerical simulations using the recently developed
selected projective quantum eigensolver (SPQE) approach, which relies on an
adaptive UCC ansatz built from arbitrary-order particle-hole excitation
operators. We show that both FEB- and QEB-SPQE decrease the number of CNOT
gates compared to traditional SPQE by factors as large as 15. At the same time,
QEB-SPQE requires, in general, more ansatz parameters than FEB-SPQE, in
particular those corresponding to higher-than-double excitations, resulting in
quantum circuits with larger CNOT counts. Although ADAPT-VQE generates quantum
circuits with fewer CNOTs than SPQE, SPQE requires orders of magnitude less
residual element evaluations than gradient element evaluations in ADAPT-VQE.

particularly in domains without plentiful data. The mixup algorithm improves
generalization by linearly interpolating a pair of examples and their
corresponding labels. These interpolated examples augment the original training
set. Mixup has shown promising results in various classification tasks, but
systematic analysis of mixup in regression remains underexplored. Using mixup
directly on regression labels can result in arbitrarily incorrect labels. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful algorithm, C-Mixup, to improve
generalization on regression tasks. In contrast with vanilla mixup, which picks
training examples for mixing with uniform probability, C-Mixup adjusts the
sampling probability based on the similarity of the labels. Our theoretical
analysis confirms that C-Mixup with label similarity obtains a smaller mean
square error in supervised regression and meta-regression than vanilla mixup
and using feature similarity. Another benefit of C-Mixup is that it can improve
out-of-distribution robustness, where the test distribution is different from
the training distribution. By selectively interpolating examples with similar
labels, it mitigates the effects of domain-associated information and yields
domain-invariant representations. We evaluate C-Mixup on eleven datasets,
ranging from tabular to video data. Compared to the best prior approach,
C-Mixup achieves 6.56%, 4.76%, 5.82% improvements in in-distribution
generalization, task generalization, and out-of-distribution robustness,
respectively. Code is released at https://github.com/huaxiuyao/C-Mixup.

to accrete external gas due to its fast flow passed them (so called 'fast flow
haloes'). These are typically located near void walls. We determine that these
haloes have recently crossed the void wall and are still moving away from it.
their motion counter to that of ambient gas falling towards the void wall
results in fast flows that make external gas accretion very challenging, and
often cause partial gas loss via the resultant ram pressures. Using an
analytical approach, we model the impact of such ram pressures on the gas
inside haloes of different masses. A halo's external gas accretion is typically
cut off, with partial stripping of halo gas. For masses below a few times
10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, their halo gas is heavily truncated but not completely

gas morphology, indicating their surrounding gas is being swept away, cutting
them off from further external accretion. These results highlight how, even in

RDF is the de-facto standard model for knowledge graphs on the Semantic Web and
supported by a rich ecosystem for inference and processing. The property graph
model, in contrast, provides advantages in scalable graph analytical tasks,
such as graph matching, path analysis, and graph traversal. RDF-star extends
RDF and allows capturing metadata as a first-class citizen. To tap on the

Hence, this paper provides a step towards transforming RDF-star graphs into

competitive results have been achieved using two-stage FSOD detectors,
typically one-stage FSODs underperform compared to them. We make the
observation that the large gap in performance between two-stage and one-stage
FSODs are mainly due to their weak discriminability, which is explained by a
small post-fusion receptive field and a small number of foreground samples in
the loss function. To address these limitations, we propose the Few-shot
RetinaNet (FSRN) that consists of: a multi-way support training strategy to
augment the number of foreground samples for dense meta-detectors, an early
multi-level feature fusion providing a wide receptive field that covers the
whole anchor area and two augmentation techniques on query and source images to
enhance transferability. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach
addresses the limitations and boosts both discriminability and transferability.
FSRN is almost two times faster than two-stage FSODs while remaining

recently there has been a massive use of images and videos on social platforms,
motivating sentiment analysis from other modalities. Current studies show that
exploring other modalities (e.g., images) increases sentiment analysis
performance. State-of-the-art multimodal models, such as CLIP and VisualBERT,
are pre-trained on datasets with the text paired with images. Although the
results obtained by these models are promising, pre-training and sentiment
analysis fine-tuning tasks of these models are computationally expensive. This
paper introduces a transfer learning approach using joint fine-tuning for
sentiment analysis. Our proposal achieved competitive results using a more
straightforward alternative fine-tuning strategy that leverages different
pre-trained unimodal models and efficiently combines them in a multimodal
space. Moreover, our proposal allows flexibility when incorporating any
pre-trained model for texts and images during the joint fine-tuning stage,
being especially interesting for sentiment classification in low-resource
scenarios.

is challenging. Parametric max-stable processes (MSPs) are common choices for
modeling spatially-indexed block maxima, where an assumption of stationarity is
usual to make inference feasible. However, this assumption is unrealistic for
data observed over a large or complex domain. We develop a
computationally-efficient method for estimating extremal dependence using a
globally nonstationary but locally-stationary MSP construction, with the
spatial domain divided into a fine grid of subregions, each with its own
dependence parameters. We use LASSO ($L_1$) or ridge ($L_2$) penalties to
obtain spatially-smooth parameter estimates. We then develop a novel
data-driven algorithm to merge homogeneous neighboring subregions. The
algorithm facilitates model parsimony and interpretability. To make our model
suitable for high-dimensional data, we exploit a pairwise likelihood to perform
inference and discuss its computational and statistical efficiency. We apply
our proposed method to model monthly maximum temperature data at over 1400
sites in Nepal and the surrounding Himalayan and sub-Himalayan regions; we show
significant improvements in model fit compared to a stationary model.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the estimated merged partition is
interpretable from a geographic perspective and leads to better model
diagnostics by adequately reducing the number of parameters.

quasi-periodic attractors in a model of Celestial Mechanics: the spin-orbit
problem with a dissipative tidal torque. This problem is a singular
perturbation of a conservative system. The goal is to show that it is possible
to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the computation of quasi-periodic
attractors for parameter values extremely close to the breakdown and,
therefore, it is possible to obtain information on the mechanism of breakdown
of these quasi-periodic attractors.
  The result is obtained by implementing a method that uses at the same time
numerical and rigorous improvements, in particular, (i) the time-one map of the
spin-orbit problem (so that the invariant objects we seek for have less
dimensions), (ii) very accurate computations of the time-one map (high order
methods with extended precision arithmetic), (iii) very efficient KAM methods
for maps (they are quadratically convergent, the step has low storage
requirements and low operation count), (iv) the algorithms are backed by a
rigorous a-posteriori KAM Theorem, that establishes that, if the algorithm is
successful and produces a small residual, then there is a true solution nearby,
and (v) The algorithms are guaranteed to reach arbitrarily close to the border
of existence, given enough computer resources. Indeed, monitoring the
properties of the solution, we obtain very effective criteria to compute the
parameters for the breakdown to happen. We do not know of any other method
which can compute even heuristically this level of accurate and reliable values
for this model.
  We also study several scale invariant observables of the tori. The behavior
at breakdown does not satisfy standard scaling relations. Hence, the breakdown
phenomena of the spin-orbit problem, are not described by a hyperbolic fixed
point of the renormalization operator.

linear electromagnetic gyrokinetic (GK) model in a tokamak flux-tube geometry
using a moment approach based on the expansion of the perturbed distribution
function on a velocity-space Hermite-Laguerre polynomials basis. A hierarchy of
equations of the expansion coefficients, referred to as the gyro-moments (GM),
is derived. We verify the numerical implementation of the GM hierarchy in the
collisionless limit by performing a comparison with the continuum GK code GENE,
recovering the linear properties of the ion-temperature gradient, trapped
electron, kinetic ballooning, and microtearing modes, as well as the
collisionless damping of zonal flows. The present investigation reveals the
ability of the GM approach to describe fine velocity-space scale structures
appearing near the trapped and passing boundary and kinetic effects associated
with parallel and perpendicular particle drifts. In addition, the effects of
collisions are studied using advanced collision operators, including the GK
Coulomb collision operator. The main findings are that the number of GMs
necessary for convergence decreases with plasma collisionality and is lower for
pressure gradient-driven modes, such as in H-mode pedestal regions, compared to
instabilities driven by trapped particles and magnetic gradient drifts often
found in the core. The accuracy of approximations often used to model
collisions (relative to the GK Coulomb operator) is studied, showing
differences between collision operator models that increase with collisionality
and electron temperature gradient in the case of TEM. The present linear
analysis demonstrates that the GM approach efficiently describes the plasma
dynamics for typical parameters of the tokamak boundary, ranging from the
low-collisionality banana H-mode to the high-collisionality Pfirsch-Schl\""uter

Conversely, the known efficient MLPs are much less effective than GNNs due to

simple KD methods that match independent link logits or node representations,
LLP distills relational knowledge that is centered around each (anchor) node to
the student MLP. Specifically, we propose rank-based matching and
distribution-based matching strategies that complement each other. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LLP boosts the link prediction performance of MLPs
with significant margins, and even outperforms the teacher GNNs on 7 out of 8

analyze the experiment with the optimal bias-variance tradeoff, we develop a
novel experiment-selector cross-validated targeted maximum likelihood estimator

difference in conditional mean outcome under control between the RCT and
combined experiments and 2) an estimate of the average treatment effect on a
negative control outcome (NCO). We define the asymptotic distribution of the
ES-CVTMLE under varying magnitudes of bias and construct confidence intervals
by Monte Carlo simulation. In simulations involving violations of
identification assumptions, the ES-CVTMLE had better coverage than
test-then-pool approaches and an NCO-based bias adjustment approach and higher
power than one implementation of a Bayesian dynamic borrowing approach. We
further demonstrate the ability of the ES-CVTMLE to distinguish biased from
unbiased external controls through a re-analysis of the effect of liraglutide
on glycemic control from the LEADER trial. The ES-CVTMLE has the potential to
improve power while providing relatively robust inference for future hybrid

on this assumption, and supported by extensive indoor directional channel
measurements at 160 GHz, this study advocates the use of very simple modulation
and equalization techniques for sub-THz mobile access. Specifically, we
demonstrate that, under the aforementioned transmission regimes, little or no
equalization is needed for scoring significant capacity gain targets. In
particular, we show that single-carrier or low-number-of-subcarriers
modulations are very attractive competitors to the dramatically more complex
and energy inefficient traditional multi-carrier designs.

  Easy As Unconstrained Optimization",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Consider applying first-order methods to solve the smooth convex constrained
optimization problem of the form $\min_{x \in X} F(x).$ For a simple closed
convex set $X$ which is easy to project onto, Nesterov proposed the Accelerated
Gradient Descent (AGD) method to solve the constrained problem as efficiently
as an unconstrained problem in terms of the number of gradient computations of
$F$ (i.e., oracle complexity). For a more complicated $\mathcal{X}$ described
by function constraints, i.e., $\mathcal{X} = \{x \in X: g(x) \leq 0\}$, where
the projection onto $\mathcal{X}$ is not possible, it is an open question
whether the function constrained problem can be solved as efficiently as an
unconstrained problem in terms of the number of gradient computations for $F$
and $g$. In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to the question by
proposing a single-loop Accelerated Constrained Gradient Descent (ACGD) method.
The ACGD method modifies the AGD method by changing the descent step to a
constrained descent step, which adds only a few linear constraints to the prox
mapping. It enjoys almost the same oracle complexity as the optimal one for
minimizing the optimal Lagrangian function, i.e., the Lagrangian multiplier
$\lambda$ being fixed to the optimal multiplier $\lambda^*$. These upper oracle
complexity bounds are shown to be unimprovable under a certain optimality
regime with new lower oracle complexity bounds. To enhance its efficiency for
large-scale problems with many function constraints, we introduce an ACGD with
Sliding (ACGD-S) method which replaces the possibly computationally demanding
constrained descent step with a sequence of basic matrix-vector
multiplications. The ACGD-S method shares the same oracle complexity as the
ACGD method, and its computation complexity, measured by the number of
matrix-vector multiplications, is also unimprovable.

110-160 metres. During operation, they will monitor field stars at the
intersections of the ecliptic and galactic plane for serendipitous stellar
occultations (SSOs) by trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). At a frame rate of 40
frames per second (fps), Fresnel diffraction in the occultation light curve can
be resolved and, with coincident detections, be used to estimate basic
properties of the occulting object. Using off-the-shelf components, the Colibri
system streams imagery to disk at a rate of 1.5 GB/s for next-day processing by
a custom occultation detection pipeline.
  The imaging system has been tested and is found to perform well, given the
moderate site conditions. Limiting magnitudes at 40 fps are found to be about
12.1 (temporal SNR=5, visible light Gaia G band) with time-series standard
deviations ranging from about 0.035 mag to >0.2 mag. SNR is observed to
decrease linearly with magnitude for stars fainter than about G = 9.5 mag.
Brighter than this limit, SNR is constant, suggesting that atmospheric
scintillation is the dominant noise source. Astrometric solutions show errors
typically less than approximately 0.3 pixels (0.8 arc seconds) without a need
for high-order corrections.

systems is the accurate modeling of the non-Markovian behavior arising from the

of scale separations, where the reduced dynamics generally exhibits pronounced
memory and non-white noise terms. We propose a data-driven approach to learn
the reduced model of multi-dimensional resolved variables that faithfully
retains the non-Markovian dynamics. Different from the common approaches based
on the direct construction of the memory function, the present approach seeks a
set of non-Markovian features that encode the history of the resolved
variables, and establishes a joint learning of the extended Markovian dynamics
in terms of both the resolved variables and these features. The training is
based on matching the evolution of the correlation functions of the extended
variables that can be directly obtained from the ones of the resolved
variables. The constructed model essentially approximates the multi-dimensional
generalized Langevin equation and ensures numerical stability without empirical
treatment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by constructing the
reduced models of molecular systems in terms of both one-dimensional and
four-dimensional resolved variables.

stream turbidity one step ahead, using surrogate data from relatively low-cost
in-situ sensors and publicly available databases. We iteratively trialled
combinations of four surrogate covariates (rainfall, water level, air
temperature and total global solar exposure) selecting a final model for each
type that minimised the corrected Akaike Information Criterion.
Cross-validation using a rolling time-window indicated that ARIMA, which
included the rainfall and water-level covariates only, produced the most
accurate predictions, followed closely by GAM, which included all four
covariates. We constructed a meta-model, trained on time-series features of
turbidity, to take advantage of the strengths of each model over different time
points and predict the best model (that with the lowest forecast error one-step
prior) for each time step. The meta-model outperformed all other models,
indicating that this methodology can yield high accuracy and may be a viable
alternative to using measurements sourced directly from turbidity-sensors where
costs prohibit their deployment and maintenance, and when predicting turbidity
across the short term. Our findings also indicated that temperature and
light-associated variables, for example underwater illuminance, may hold
promise as cost-effective, high-frequency surrogates of turbidity, especially
when combined with other covariates, like rainfall, that are typically measured

graphene (PBG), in which a supermodulation is induced via metallic gates rather
than the moire effect. We show that, by varying either the gap or the
modulation strength, bilayer graphene can be tuned into the strongly correlated
regime. Further calculations show that this is not possible in monolayer

the periodic potential and demonstrate that this system is experimentally

condition for H\""ormander-type oscillatory integral operators, which we call

conjecture that for H\""ormander-type oscillatory integral operators satisfying

Bourgain's condition fails, then the $L^{\infty} \to L^q$ boundedness always
fails for some $q= q(n) > \frac{2n}{n-1}$, extending Bourgain's
three-dimensional result. On the other hand, if Bourgain's condition holds,
then we prove $L^p$ bounds for H\""ormander-type oscillatory integral operators
for a range of $p$ that extends the currently best-known range for the Fourier

gives new progress on the Fourier restriction problem and the Bochner-Riesz

on supervised downstream tasks, such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), and
goal-conditioned planning. Compared to past works on dynamics modeling, our
method achieves significantly better long-term synthesis of object dynamics,
while retaining high quality visual generation. Besides, SlotFormer enables VQA
models to reason about the future without object-level labels, even
outperforming counterparts that use ground-truth annotations. Finally, we show
its ability to serve as a world model for model-based planning, which is

luminosity space is constructed using 11 bands that span from far ultraviolet
to near-infrared for redshift < 0.1 galaxies observed with GALEX, SDSS, and
UKIDSS. The two latent parameters are sufficient to express 93.2% of the
variance in the galaxy sample, suggesting that this Galaxy Manifold is one of
the most efficient representations of galaxies. The transformation between the
observed luminosities and the manifold parameters as an analytic mapping is
provided. The manifold representation provides accurate (85%) morphological
classifications with a simple linear boundary, and galaxy properties can be
estimated with minimal scatter (0.12 dex and 0.04 dex for star formation rate
and stellar mass, respectively) by calibrating with the two-dimensional
manifold location. Under the assumption that the manifold expresses the
possible parameter space of galaxies, the evolution on the manifold is
considered. We find that constant and exponentially decreasing star formation
histories form almost orthogonal modes of evolution on the manifold. Through
these simple models, we understand that the two modes are closely related to
gas content, which suggests the close relationship of the manifold to gas
accretion. Without assuming a star formation history, a gas-regulated model
reproduces an exponentially declining star formation history with a timescale
of $\sim$1.2 Gyrs on the manifold. Lastly, the found manifold suggests a
paradigm where galaxies are characterized by their mass/scale and specific SFR,
which agrees with previous studies of dimensionality reduction.

virtual reality. Current large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation methods
usually use down-sampling operations to improve computation efficiency and
acquire point clouds with multi-resolution. However, this may cause the problem
of missing local information. Meanwhile, it is difficult for networks to
capture global information in large-scale distributed contexts. To capture
local and global information effectively, we propose an end-to-end deep neural
network called LACV-Net for large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation. The
proposed network contains three main components: 1) a local adaptive feature
augmentation module (LAFA) to adaptively learn the similarity of centroids and
neighboring points to augment the local context; 2) a comprehensive VLAD module
(C-VLAD) that fuses local features with multi-layer, multi-scale, and
multi-resolution to represent a comprehensive global description vector; and 3)
an aggregation loss function to effectively optimize the segmentation
boundaries by constraining the adaptive weight from the LAFA module. Compared
to state-of-the-art networks on several large-scale benchmark datasets,
including S3DIS, Toronto3D, and SensatUrban, we demonstrated the effectiveness
of the proposed network.

Previous works typically employ conditional GANs where the generator explicitly

few limited attributes and a separate generator is required for each dataset or
attribute set. Inspired by the recent advancement of diffusion models, we
explore the classifier-guided diffusion that leverages the off-the-shelf

order to achieve a generic editing pipeline, we pose this as multi-attribute
image manipulation task, where the attribute ranges from item category, fabric,

fail in our challenging setting, and study efficient adaptation scheme that
involves recently introduced attention-pooling technique to obtain a
multi-attribute classifier guidance. Based on this, we present a mask-free
fashion attribute editing framework that leverages the classifier logits and
the cross-attention map for manipulation. We empirically demonstrate that our

Top-K popular contents are identified as the output of the learning model. Most
existing datadriven popularity prediction models, however, are not suitable for
the coded/uncoded content placement frameworks. On the one hand, in
coded/uncoded content placement, in addition to classifying contents into two
groups, i.e., popular and nonpopular, the probability of content request is
required to identify which content should be stored partially/completely, where
this information is not provided by existing data-driven popularity prediction

unchanged over a short horizon only works for content with a smooth request
pattern. To tackle these challenges, we develop a Multiple-model (hybrid)
Transformer-based Edge Caching (MTEC) framework with higher generalization
ability, suitable for various types of content with different time-varying
behavior, that can be adapted with coded/uncoded content placement frameworks.
Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed MTEC caching
framework in comparison to its counterparts in terms of the cache-hit ratio,
classification accuracy, and the transferred byte volume.

of soft errors on NN processing. They are accurate but usually specific to
limited configurations of errors and NN models due to the prohibitively slow
simulation speed especially for large NN models and datasets. With the
observation that the influence of soft errors propagates across a large number
of neurons and accumulates as well, we propose to characterize the soft error
induced data disturbance on each neuron with normal distribution model
according to central limit theorem and develop a series of statistical models
to analyze the behavior of NN models under soft errors in general. The
statistical models reveal not only the correlation between soft errors and NN
model accuracy, but also how NN parameters such as quantization and
architecture affect the reliability of NNs. The proposed models are compared
with fault simulation and verified comprehensively. In addition, we observe
that the statistical models that characterize the soft error influence can also
be utilized to predict fault simulation results in many cases and we explore
the use of the proposed statistical models to accelerate fault simulations of
NNs. According to our experiments, the accelerated fault simulation shows
almost two orders of magnitude speedup with negligible simulation accuracy loss

disorder characterized by beta-amyloid, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration.
The massive heterogeneity between neurobiological examinations and clinical
assessment is the current biggest challenge in the early diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease, urging for a comprehensive stratification of the aging
population that is defined by reliable neurobiological biomarkers and closely
associated with clinical outcomes. However, existing statistical inference
approaches in neuroimaging studies of AD subtype identification fail to take
into account the neuropathological domain knowledge, which could lead to
ill-posed results that are sometimes inconsistent with neurological principles.
To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a novel pathology steered stratification

outperforms K-means and SuStaIn in both inter-cluster heterogeneity and

accelerate training and increase the risk of overfitting. Motivated by this
observation, we propose Attribution-Driven Dropout (AD-DROP), which randomly
discards some high-attribution positions to encourage the model to make
predictions by relying more on low-attribution positions to reduce overfitting.
We also develop a cross-tuning strategy to alternate fine-tuning and AD-DROP to
avoid dropping high-attribution positions excessively. Extensive experiments on
various benchmarks show that AD-DROP yields consistent improvements over
baselines. Analysis further confirms that AD-DROP serves as a strategic
regularizer to prevent overfitting during fine-tuning.

array of the flat-panel detector (FPD) is usually binned into a reduced matrix
size. By doing so, the signal readout speed can be increased by over 4-9 times
at the expense of sacrificing the spatial resolution by at least 50%-67%.
Clearly, such tradition poses a main bottleneck in generating high spatial
resolution and high temporal resolution CBCT images at the same time. In
addition, the conventional FPD is also difficult in generating dual-energy CBCT
images. In this paper, we propose an innovative super resolution dual-energy
CBCT imaging method, named as suRi, based on dual-layer FPD (DL-FPD) to
overcome these aforementioned difficulties at once. With suRi, specifically, an
1D or 2D sub-pixel (half pixel in this study) shifted binning is applied to
replace the conventionally aligned binning to double the spatial sampling rate
during the dual-energy data acquisition. As a result, the suRi approach
provides a new strategy to enable high signal readout speed and high spatial
resolution CBCT imaging with FPD. Moreover, a penalized likelihood material
decomposition algorithm is developed to directly reconstruct the high
resolution bases from the dual-energy CBCT projections containing spatial
sub-pixel shifts. Experiments based on the single-layer FPD and DL-FPD are
performed with physical phantoms and biological specimen to validate this newly
developed suRi method. The synthesized monochromatic CT imaging results
demonstrate that suRi can significantly improve the spatial image resolution by
46.15%. We believe the developed suRi method would be capable to greatly
enhance the imaging performance of the DL-FPD based dual-energy CBCT systems in
future.

concentrations of defects present, are obtained through energy minimization
with an empirical interatomic potential. Each of the structures is refined
against an experimental PDF. The structures with the lowest goodness of fit
$R_w$ values are taken as being representative of the experimental structure.
The workflow is applied to anatase titanium dioxide ($a$-TiO$_2$) and
tetragonal zirconium dioxide ($t$-ZrO$_2$) synthesized in the presence of
microwave radiation, a low temperature process that generates disorder. The
results suggest that titanium vacancies and interstitials are the dominant
defects in $a$-TiO$_2$, while oxygen vacancies dominate in $t$-ZrO$_2$.
Analysis of the atomic displacement parameters extracted from the PDF
refinement and mean squared displacements calculated from molecular dynamics
simulations indicate that while these two quantities are closely related, it is
challenging to make quantitative comparisons between them. The workflow can be
applied to other materials systems, including nanoparticles.

study the power of spectral algorithms using two matrices in a graph

  We analyze a two-matrix spectral algorithm for the problem of identifying

the problem of recovering community assignments exactly in the censored
stochastic block model, where each edge status is revealed independently with
some probability. We show that spectral algorithms based on two matrices are
optimal and succeed in recovering communities up to the information theoretic

any spectral algorithm based on one matrix is suboptimal. This is in contrast

seamless and transparent interaction between the transported objects and a
human worker while considering safety constraints during operations by
exploiting the redundancy of the internal transportation system. The critical
system components are (a) a distributed force-sensor-free payload external

that exploits the internal system redundancy to guarantee the execution of
additional tasks devoted to preserving the human or robot safety without
affecting the payload trajectory tracking or quality of interaction. We
validate the approach through extensive real-world experiments, including the
robot team assisting the human in transporting and manipulating a load or the

practical and robust point cloud detectors, which is challenging due to the
heavy collection costs. To alleviate the challenge and start the first step for
robust point cloud detection, we propose the physical-aware simulation methods
to generate degraded point clouds under different real-world common
corruptions. Then, for the first attempt, we construct a benchmark based on the
physical-aware common corruptions for point cloud detectors, which contains a

Moreover, we further study the effectiveness of existing robustness enhancement

excitations between two spatially separated magnetic samples. We enunciate how
the application of a two-photon parametric drive to the cavity can lead to
stark amplification in this transfer efficiency. The recurrent multiphoton
absorption by the cavity opens up an infinite ladder of accessible energy
levels, which can induce higher-order transitions within the magnon Fock space.
This is reflected in a heightened spin-current response from one of the
magnetic samples when the neighboring sample is coherently pumped. The
enhancement induced by the parametric drive can be considerably high within the
stable dynamical region. Specifically, near the periphery of the stability
boundary, the spin current is amplified by several orders of magnitude. Such
striking enhancement factors are attributed to the emergence of parametrically
induced strong coherences precipitated by a long-lived mode. While
contextualized in magnonics, the generality of the principle would allow
applications to energy transfer between systems contained in parametric
cavities.

  monitoring and determining optimal inspection intervals",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Recently, a growing amount interest is quite evident in modelling dependent
competing risks in life time prognosis problem. In this work, we propose to
model the dependent competing risks by Marshal-Olkin bivariate exponential
distribution. The observable data consists of number of failures due to
different causes across different time intervals. The failure count data is
common in instances like one shot devices where state of the subjects are
inspected at different inspection times rather than the exact failure times.
The point estimation of the life time distribution in presence of competing
risk has been studied through divergence based robust estimation method called
minimum density power divergence estimation (MDPDE). The testing of hypothesis
is performed based on a Wald type test statistic. The influence function is
derived both for the point estimator and the test statistic, which reflects the
degree of robustness. Another, key contribution of this work is to determine
the optimal set of inspection times based on some predefined objectives. This
article presents determination of multi criteria based optimal design.
Population based heuristic algorithm non-dominated sorting-based multiobjective
Genetic algorithm is exploited to solve this optimization problem.

been a topic of great concern. The two-stream structure, including an RGB
appearance stream and an optical flow motion stream, has been widely used as a
typical pipeline for VSOD tasks, but the existing methods usually only use
motion features to unidirectionally guide appearance features or adaptively but
blindly fuse two modality features. However, these methods underperform in
diverse scenarios due to the uncomprehensive and unspecific learning schemes.
In this paper, following a more secure modeling philosophy, we deeply
investigate the importance of appearance modality and motion modality in a more
comprehensive way and propose a VSOD network with up and down parallel
symmetry, named PSNet. Two parallel branches with different dominant modalities
are set to achieve complete video saliency decoding with the cooperation of the
Gather Diffusion Reinforcement (GDR) module and Cross-modality Refinement and
Complement (CRC) module. Finally, we use the Importance Perception Fusion (IPF)
module to fuse the features from two parallel branches according to their
different importance in different scenarios. Experiments on four dataset

utilizes the Ice Giants as Targets for Galactic Neutrinos. The purpose of this
research stems from the concept of wanting to find a new method of observing
the Galactic Core (GC) of the Milky Way and the Supermassive black hole, Sag
A*. Observations of the GC have been made in every accessible wavelength except
for the regions of space that are too dense for photons to probe. In these
regions, we may instead use neutrinos. Neutrinos from the Active Galactic
Nucleus are emitted at extreme energies, 10 GeV to EeV scales, but have an
extremely low flux measured here at Earth. Neutrino telescopes such as the
IceCube Observatory have only been able to measure a handful of neutrinos that
might correlate to the GC. But using Gravitational lensing, our sun can be used
as a lens which increases the 'light' collection power for neutrinos by a
factor of $10^{13}$, with the trade-off that the minimum focal point is located
at 22 AU. This means that Uranus and Neptune are suitable natural targets for
these neutrinos to interact with and observe the effects of a spacecraft in
orbit. Initial studies use GEANT4, a particle physics simulation toolbox
developed by CERN, to facilitate the propagation of energetic particles passing
through the atmosphere of Neptune. Various aspects are studied to understand
the behaviors of these particle interactions. For each of these aspects, we
modify several variables such as particle type, energy, interaction depth, and
orbital distance from the surface. I also discuss the versatility of this
neutrino detector which has the possibility of mapping out the inner structure
of the Ice Giants, in-depth studies of the neutrinos coming from the GC, and
possibilities to use this method for other cosmic neutrino sources.

our new result, we find a new family of manifolds whose cohomology rings are

corresponding text in a meme are related, they do not necessarily convey the
same meaning when viewed individually. Hence, detecting hateful memes requires
careful consideration of both visual and textual information. Multimodal
pre-training can be beneficial for this task because it effectively captures
the relationship between the image and the text by representing them in a
similar feature space. Furthermore, it is essential to model the interactions
between the image and text features through intermediate fusion. Most existing
methods either employ multimodal pre-training or intermediate fusion, but not
both. In this work, we propose the Hate-CLIPper architecture, which explicitly
models the cross-modal interactions between the image and text representations
obtained using Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) encoders via a
feature interaction matrix (FIM). A simple classifier based on the FIM
representation is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Hateful
Memes Challenge (HMC) dataset with an AUROC of 85.8, which even surpasses the
human performance of 82.65. Experiments on other meme datasets such as
Propaganda Memes and TamilMemes also demonstrate the generalizability of the
proposed approach. Finally, we analyze the interpretability of the FIM

Knowledge distillation (KD) is developed to combine the diverse knowledge from

lightweight student. However, to avoid oversmoothing, GNNs are often shallow,
which deviates from the setting of KD. In this context, we revisit KD by
separating its benefits from model compression and emphasizing its power of
transferring knowledge. To this end, we need to tackle two challenges: how to
transfer knowledge from compact teachers to a student with the same capacity;
and, how to exploit student GNN's own strength to learn knowledge. In this
paper, we propose a novel adaptive KD framework, called BGNN, which
sequentially transfers knowledge from multiple GNNs into a student GNN. We also
introduce an adaptive temperature module and a weight boosting module. These
modules guide the student to the appropriate knowledge for effective learning.
Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of BGNN. In
particular, we achieve up to 3.05% improvement for node classification and
6.35% improvement for graph classification over vanilla GNNs.

increasing trust, and (2) facilitating debugging. Such debugging is especially
relevant for self-adaptive systems, because the reward function, which
quantifies the feedback to the RL algorithm, must be defined by developers. The
reward function must be explicitly defined by developers, thus introducing a
potential for human error. To explain Deep RL for self-adaptive systems, we
enhance and combine two existing explainable RL techniques from the machine
learning literature. The combined technique, XRL-DINE, overcomes the respective
limitations of the individual techniques. We present a proof-of-concept
implementation of XRL-DINE, as well as qualitative and quantitative results of
applying XRL-DINE to a self-adaptive system exemplar.

thermal management. The present study investigates natural convection heat
transfer inside a square cavity with an alternately active bi-heater that
mimics two cores of a dual-core processor. Pulsating heat flux condition is
implemented on two discrete heaters with a certain switching frequency. The
heat transfer characteristics have been investigated for Prandtl number =0.71
and Rayleigh number in the range of 10^3 - 10^6 using OpenFOAM. The results
obtained for alternative active heaters configuration have been compared with
that of the steady single heater and steady double-symmetric heaters subjected
to the same heat flux. The alternately active heater configuration showed
better heat transfer characteristics than a single steady heater for all
switchover periods, and better than a double-symmetric heater for low
switchover periods. However, it is found that for higher values of the
switchover period, the maximum temperature of alternately active heaters
configuration touches the temperature of steady single heater. This threshold
switchover period has been determined using a scale analysis. The threshold
switchover periods determined from scale analysis are consistent with the
results obtained from numerical simulations for different Rayleigh numbers and
heater lengths.

  Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to improve the generalization performance of
multiple tasks by exploiting the shared factors among them. Various metrics
(e.g., F-score, Area Under the ROC Curve) are used to evaluate the performances
of MTL methods. Most existing MTL methods try to minimize either the
misclassified errors for classification or the mean squared errors for
regression. In this paper, we propose a method to directly optimize the
evaluation metrics for a large family of MTL problems. The formulation of MTL
that directly optimizes evaluation metrics is the combination of two parts: (1)
a regularizer defined on the weight matrix over all tasks, in order to capture
the relatedness of these tasks; (2) a sum of multiple structured hinge losses,
each corresponding to a surrogate of some evaluation metric on one task. This
formulation is challenging in optimization because both of its parts are
non-smooth. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel optimization procedure
based on the alternating direction scheme of multipliers, where we decompose
the whole optimization problem into a sub-problem corresponding to the
regularizer and another sub-problem corresponding to the structured hinge
losses. For a large family of MTL problems, the first sub-problem has
closed-form solutions. To solve the second sub-problem, we propose an efficient
primal-dual algorithm via coordinate ascent. Extensive evaluation results
demonstrate that, in a large family of MTL problems, the proposed MTL method of
directly optimization evaluation metrics has superior performance gains against
the corresponding baseline methods.

Telescope (JCMT) as part of the BISTRO (B-fields in Star-forming Region
Observations) survey. The orientations of the magnetic field follow the spiral
structure of Mon R2, which are well-described by an axisymmetric magnetic field
model. We estimate the turbulent component of the magnetic field using the
angle difference between our observations and the best-fit model of the
underlying large-scale mean magnetic field. This estimate is used to calculate
the magnetic field strength using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, for
which we also obtain the distribution of volume density and velocity dispersion
using a column density map derived from $Herschel$ data and the C$^{18}$O ($J$
= 3-2) data taken with HARP on the JCMT, respectively. We make maps of magnetic
field strengths and mass-to-flux ratios, finding that magnetic field strengths
vary from 0.02 to 3.64 mG with a mean value of 1.0 $\pm$ 0.06 mG, and the mean
critical mass-to-flux ratio is 0.47 $\pm$ 0.02. Additionally, the mean Alfv\'en
Mach number is 0.35 $\pm$ 0.01. This suggests that in Mon R2, magnetic fields
provide resistance against large-scale gravitational collapse, and magnetic
pressure exceeds turbulent pressure. We also investigate the properties of each
filament in Mon R2. Most of the filaments are aligned along the magnetic field
direction and are magnetically sub-critical.

benchmarks for computer vision tasks, their application in the real-world is

lack of robustness, unveiled by the striking effectiveness of adversarial
attacks. Current attack methods are able to manipulate the network's prediction
by adding specific but small amounts of noise to the input. In turn,
adversarial training (AT) aims to achieve robustness against such attacks and
ideally a better model generalization ability by including adversarial samples
in the trainingset. However, an in-depth analysis of the resulting robust
models beyond adversarial robustness is still pending. In this paper, we
empirically analyze a variety of adversarially trained models that achieve high
robust accuracies when facing state-of-the-art attacks and we show that AT has
an interesting side-effect: it leads to models that are significantly less
overconfident with their decisions, even on clean data than non-robust models.
Further, our analysis of robust models shows that not only AT but also the
model's building blocks (like activation functions and pooling) have a strong
influence on the models' prediction confidences. Data & Project website:

2251-178 was caught in late 2020, which triggered multi-wavelength (NIR to
X-ray) observations targeting this radio-quiet quasar. In the X-ray band, the
obscurer leads to a flux drop in the soft X-ray band from late 2020 to early
2021. X-ray obscuration events might have a quasi-period of two decades
considering earlier events in 1980 and 1996. In the UV band, a forest of weak
blueshifted absorption features emerged in the blue wing of Ly$\alpha$
$\lambda1216$ in late 2020. Our XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and HST/COS observations
are obtained simultaneously, hence, the transient X-ray obscuration event is
expected to account for the UV outflow, although they are not necessarily
caused by the same part of the wind. Both blueshifted and redshifted absorption
features were found for He {\sc i} $\lambda10830$, but no previous NIR spectra
are available for comparison. The X-ray observational features of MR 2251-178
shared similarities with some other type 1 AGNs with obscuring wind. However,
observational features in the UV to NIR bands are distinctly different from
those seen in other AGN with obscuring winds. A general understanding of the
observational variety and the nature of obscuring wind is still lacking.

with a corresponding object/stuff class continually. To this end, it is crucial
to learn novel classes incrementally without forgetting previously learned
knowledge. Current CISS methods typically use a knowledge distillation (KD)
technique for preserving classifier logits, or freeze a feature extractor, to
avoid the forgetting problem. The strong constraints, however, prevent learning
discriminative features for novel classes. We introduce a CISS framework that
alleviates the forgetting problem and facilitates learning novel classes
effectively. We have found that a logit can be decomposed into two terms. They
quantify how likely an input belongs to a particular class or not, providing a
clue for a reasoning process of a model. The KD technique, in this context,
preserves the sum of two terms (i.e., a class logit), suggesting that each
could be changed and thus the KD does not imitate the reasoning process. To
impose constraints on each term explicitly, we propose a new decomposed
knowledge distillation (DKD) technique, improving the rigidity of a model and
addressing the forgetting problem more effectively. We also introduce a novel
initialization method to train new classifiers for novel classes. In CISS, the
number of negative training samples for novel classes is not sufficient to
discriminate old classes. To mitigate this, we propose to transfer knowledge of
negatives to the classifiers successively using an auxiliary classifier,
boosting the performance significantly. Experimental results on standard CISS
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

great promise in representing pixel-level semantic relationships, significantly
promoting the development of unsupervised dense prediction tasks, e.g.,
unsupervised semantic segmentation (USS). The extracted relationship among
pixel-level representations typically contains rich class-aware information
that semantically identical pixel embeddings in the representation space gather
together to form sophisticated concepts. However, leveraging the learned models
to ascertain semantically consistent pixel groups or regions in the image is
non-trivial since over/ under-clustering overwhelms the conceptualization
procedure under various semantic distributions of different images. In this
work, we investigate the pixel-level semantic aggregation in self-supervised
ViT pre-trained models as image Segmentation and propose the Adaptive
Conceptualization approach for USS, termed ACSeg. Concretely, we explicitly
encode concepts into learnable prototypes and design the Adaptive Concept
Generator (ACG), which adaptively maps these prototypes to informative concepts
for each image. Meanwhile, considering the scene complexity of different
images, we propose the modularity loss to optimize ACG independent of the

the same concept. Finally, we turn the USS task into classifying the discovered
concepts in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art

referable diabetic retinopathy (rDR) from non-referable DR. Most existing
large-scale DR datasets contain only image-level labels rather than pixel-based
annotations. This motivates us to develop algorithms to classify rDR and

equivariant learning and attention-based multi-instance learning (MIL) to
tackle this problem. MIL is an effective strategy to differentiate positive and
negative instances, helping us discard background regions (negative instances)
while localizing lesion regions (positive ones). However, MIL only provides
coarse lesion localization and cannot distinguish lesions located across
adjacent patches. Conversely, a self-supervised equivariant attention mechanism
(SEAM) generates a segmentation-level class activation map (CAM) that can guide
patch extraction of lesions more accurately. Our work aims at integrating both
methods to improve rDR classification accuracy. We conduct extensive validation
experiments on the Eyepacs dataset, achieving an area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AU ROC) of 0.958, outperforming current

impressive results have been achieved recently, restoring images with both
vivid textures and reasonable structures remains a significant challenge.
Previous methods have primarily addressed regular textures while disregarding
holistic structures due to the limited receptive fields of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). To this end, we study learning a Zero-initialized residual
addition based Incremental Transformer on Structural priors (ZITS++), an
improved model upon our conference work, ZITS. Specifically, given one corrupt
image, we present the Transformer Structure Restorer (TSR) module to restore
holistic structural priors at low image resolution, which are further upsampled
by Simple Structure Upsampler (SSU) module to higher image resolution. To
recover image texture details, we use the Fourier CNN Texture Restoration (FTR)
module, which is strengthened by Fourier and large-kernel attention
convolutions. Furthermore, to enhance the FTR, the upsampled structural priors
from TSR are further processed by Structure Feature Encoder (SFE) and optimized
with the Zero-initialized Residual Addition (ZeroRA) incrementally. Besides, a
new masking positional encoding is proposed to encode the large irregular
masks. Compared with ZITS, ZITS++ improves the FTR's stability and inpainting
ability with several techniques. More importantly, we comprehensively explore
the effects of various image priors for inpainting and investigate how to
utilize them to address high-resolution image inpainting with extensive
experiments. This investigation is orthogonal to most inpainting approaches and
can thus significantly benefit the community. Codes and models will be released

learning-based Projective Transformation Rectification Network (PTRN) to

projective transformation matrix as the learning goal for photo rectification.
Additionally, to avoid the expensive collection of natural data, synthetic CXR
photos are generated under the consideration of natural perturbations, extra

study demonstrates that the use of PTRN successfully achieves the
classification performance on the spatially transformed CXR photos to the same
level as on the high-quality digital CXR images, indicating PTRN can eliminate
all negative impacts of projective transformation on the CXR photos.

both the training and test performance of a network can be improved by
maximizing GradCosine under gradient norm constraint. Based on this

paper, we further consider this problem and point out two weaknesses of ViTs in
inductive biases, that is, the spatial relevance and diverse channel
representation. First, on spatial aspect, objects are locally compact and
relevant, thus fine-grained feature needs to be extracted from a token and its
neighbors. While the lack of data hinders ViTs to attend the spatial relevance.
Second, on channel aspect, representation exhibits diversity on different
channels. But the scarce data can not enable ViTs to learn strong enough
representation for accurate recognition. To this end, we propose Dynamic Hybrid
Vision Transformer (DHVT) as the solution to enhance the two inductive biases.
On spatial aspect, we adopt a hybrid structure, in which convolution is
integrated into patch embedding and multi-layer perceptron module, forcing the
model to capture the token features as well as their neighboring features. On
channel aspect, we introduce a dynamic feature aggregation module in MLP and a
brand new ""head token"" design in multi-head self-attention module to help
re-calibrate channel representation and make different channel group

representation forms a strong enough representation for classification. With

important research field, with many real-worlds applications in the domains of
machine learning, communication systems, operation research and economics. Most
of the works in this field study maximization subject to down-closed convex set
constraints due to an inapproximability result by Vondr\'ak (2013). However,
Durr et al. (2021) showed that one can bypass this inapproximability by proving
approximation ratios that are functions of $m$, the minimum
$\ell_{\infty}$-norm of any feasible vector. Given this observation, it is
possible to get results for maximizing a DR-submodular function subject to
general convex set constraints, which has led to multiple works on this
problem. The most recent of which is a polynomial time $\tfrac{1}{4}(1 -
m)$-approximation offline algorithm due to Du (2022). However, only a
sub-exponential time $\tfrac{1}{3\sqrt{3}}(1 - m)$-approximation algorithm is
known for the corresponding online problem. In this work, we present a
polynomial time online algorithm matching the $\tfrac{1}{4}(1 -
m)$-approximation of the state-of-the-art offline algorithm. We also present an
inapproximability result showing that our online algorithm and Du's (2022)
offline algorithm are both optimal in a strong sense. Finally, we study the
empirical performance of our algorithm and the algorithm of Du (which was only
theoretically studied previously), and show that they consistently outperform
previously suggested algorithms on revenue maximization, location summarization

examples, which can produce erroneous predictions by injecting imperceptible
perturbations. In this work, we study the transferability of adversarial
examples, which is significant due to its threat to real-world applications
where model architecture or parameters are usually unknown. Many existing works
reveal that the adversarial examples are likely to overfit the surrogate model
that they are generated from, limiting its transfer attack performance against
different target models. To mitigate the overfitting of the surrogate model, we
propose a novel attack method, dubbed reverse adversarial perturbation (RAP).
Specifically, instead of minimizing the loss of a single adversarial point, we
advocate seeking adversarial example located at a region with unified low loss
value, by injecting the worst-case perturbation (the reverse adversarial
perturbation) for each step of the optimization procedure. The adversarial
attack with RAP is formulated as a min-max bi-level optimization problem. By
integrating RAP into the iterative process for attacks, our method can find
more stable adversarial examples which are less sensitive to the changes of
decision boundary, mitigating the overfitting of the surrogate model.
Comprehensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that RAP can significantly
boost adversarial transferability. Furthermore, RAP can be naturally combined
with many existing black-box attack techniques, to further boost the
transferability. When attacking a real-world image recognition system, Google
Cloud Vision API, we obtain 22% performance improvement of targeted attacks
over the compared method. Our codes are available at

is the most suitable to start a SIT control to minimize the duration of massive
releases and the amount of sterile males to release, either to reduce the
mosquito nuisance, or to reduce the epidemiological risk. Since sterilization
is not 100% efficient, we also study the impact of different levels of residual
fertility within the released sterile male population. Our study shows that
rainfall plays a major role in the dynamics of the mosquito and the SIT
control, that the best period to start a massive SIT treatment lasts from July
to December, that residual fertility has to be as small as possible, and that
increasing the size of the releases is not always necessarily interesting. We
also highlight the importance of combining SIT with mechanical control, i.e.

fitting them in memory, even during training.
  The best previous methods for table compression are so called ""post training""
quantization schemes such as ""product"" and ""residual"" quantization (Gray &
Neuhoff, 1998). These methods replace table rows with references to k-means
clustered ""codewords"". Unfortunately, clustering requires prior knowledge of
the table to be compressed, which limits the memory savings to inference time
and not training time. Hence, recent work, like the QR method (Shi et al.,
2020), has used random references (linear sketching), which can be computed
with hash functions before training. Unfortunately, the compression achieved is
inferior to that achieved by post-training quantization.
  The new algorithm, CQR, shows how to get the best of two worlds by combining
clustering and sketching: First IDs are randomly assigned to a codebook and
codewords are trained (end to end) for an epoch. Next, we expand the codebook
and apply clustering to reduce the size again. Finally, we add new random
references and continue training.
  We show experimentally close to those of post-training quantization with the

diffuse from original states to a noise distribution. This process offers a
natural way to obtain the ""whitened"" latents without any trainable parameters,

LiDAR-based global localization draws the community's focus with its robustness

rotation and translation estimation. With the theoretical guarantee, RING++ is
able to address the large viewpoint difference using a lightweight map with
sparse scans. In addition, we derive sufficient conditions of feature
extractors for the representation preserving the roto-translation invariance,
making RING++ a framework applicable to generic multi-channel features. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first learning-free framework to address all
subtasks of global localization in the sparse scan map. Validations on
real-world datasets show that our approach demonstrates better performance than

proposes a new complementary framework for human-robot collaboration that
balances the safety of humans and the efficiency of robots. In this framework,
the robot carries out given tasks using a vision-based adaptive controller, and
the human expert collaborates with the robot in the null space. Such a
decoupling drives the robot to deal with existing issues in task space (e.g.,
uncalibrated camera, limited field of view) and in null space (e.g., joint
limits) by itself while allowing the expert to adjust the configuration of the
robot body to respond to unforeseen changes (e.g., sudden invasion, change of
environment) without affecting the robot's main task. Additionally, the robot
can simultaneously learn the expert's demonstration in task space and null
space beforehand with dynamic movement primitives (DMP). Therefore, an expert's
knowledge and a robot's capability are both explored and complementary. Human
demonstration and involvement are enabled via a mixed interaction interface,

transport units used, e.g. containers. In air transportation, however,
transport units have multiple aspects which concur in the calculation of the
cost and thus optimization in the number and characteristics of the transport
units is required. In this paper, we present the air transport unit
consolidation problem where the aim is to determine how to consolidate loose
packages in transport units with the goal of minimizing the corresponding cost.
The problem is a variant of the three-dimensional bin packing problem where the
objective function is formulated according to the way costs are calculated in
the air transport business. In addition, side constraints are included to take
into account specific requirements. We propose a heuristic algorithm which
construct an initial feasible solution and then improves it through a local
search algorithm. Computational tests on randomly generated instances show that
the algorithm provides high quality solutions in a reasonable computing time.
In addition, tests on real data show that it improves solutions found in
practice by the company providing the data.

a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to represent the input
audio with discrete codes, which can then be readily used in a Transformer.
Second, using an audio-domain beat tracking model, we compute beat-related
features of the input audio and use them as embeddings in the Transformer.
Instead of generating the drum track directly as waveforms, we use a separate
VQ-VAE to encode the mel-spectrogram of a drum track into another set of
discrete codes, and train the Transformer to predict the sequence of
drum-related discrete codes. The output codes are then converted to a
mel-spectrogram with a decoder, and then to the waveform with a vocoder. We
report both objective and subjective evaluations of variants of the proposed

of the optimal initial disturbance, centered around the zonal location and
highly related to the slowly varying amplitude distribution of preexisting
synoptic-scale eddies, is obtained by the standard conditional nonlinear
optimal perturbation (CNOP) method. By demonstrating how the constraint
domain's size affects the optimal initial disturbance in the spatial
distribution and the nonlinear time evolution behavior, we find that the
nonlinear time evolution behavior of the blocking is very sensitive to the
optimal initial disturbance. When the weakening of the background westerly wind
favors the maintenance of the atmospheric blocking, the error in the initial
blocking will lead to a strong nonlinear error growth of blocking evolution in
this case. This makes the prediction of long-lived atmospheric blocking and
associated severe extreme weather events more difficult. Finally, we provide a
theoretical explanation for the cause of why the optimal initial disturbance
changes with the background westerly wind in such a way, based on the theory of
the NMI model, that the dispersive effect is proportional to the meridional
potential vorticity gradient ($PV_y$) and the nonlinear effect is inversely
proportional to $PV_y$.

Tensor decomposition decomposes a tensor into multiple low-rank matrices or

decomposition is such an algorithm, which decomposes a $n$-order tensor into

  Estimation","Accepted: BMVC 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Advances in computing have enabled widespread access to pose estimation,
creating new sources of data streams. Unlike mock set-ups for data collection,
tapping into these data streams through on-device active learning allows us to
directly sample from the real world to improve the spread of the training
distribution. However, on-device computing power is limited, implying that any
candidate active learning algorithm should have a low compute footprint while
also being reliable. Although multiple algorithms cater to pose estimation,
they either use extensive compute to power state-of-the-art results or are not
competitive in low-resource settings. We address this limitation with VL4Pose
(Visual Likelihood For Pose Estimation), a first principles approach for active
learning through out-of-distribution detection. We begin with a simple premise:
pose estimators often predict incoherent poses for out-of-distribution samples.
Hence, can we identify a distribution of poses the model has been trained on,
to identify incoherent poses the model is unsure of? Our solution involves
modelling the pose through a simple parametric Bayesian network trained via
maximum likelihood estimation. Therefore, poses incurring a low likelihood
within our framework are out-of-distribution samples making them suitable
candidates for annotation. We also observe two useful side-outcomes: VL4Pose
in-principle yields better uncertainty estimates by unifying joint and pose
level ambiguity, as well as the unintentional but welcome ability of VL4Pose to
perform pose refinement in limited scenarios. We perform qualitative and
quantitative experiments on three datasets: MPII, LSP and ICVL, spanning human
and hand pose estimation. Finally, we note that VL4Pose is simple,
computationally inexpensive and competitive, making it suitable for challenging
tasks such as on-device active learning.

stanene nanoribbons are theoretically studied under the combining effect of a

coupling in stanene lattice, applying normal electric field leads to splitting
of band degeneracy of spin-resolved energy levels in conduction and valence
bands. Furthermore, unequivalent absorption of the polarized photons at two
valleys which is attributed to an antiferromagnetic exchange field results in
unequal spin-polarized photocurrent for spin-up and spin-down components.
Interestingly, in the presence of band bending which has been induced by edge
potentials, an allowable quantum efficiency occurs over a wider wavelength

an exchange magnetic field generates spin semi-conducting behavior in the

layers are concatenations of smaller, geometrically self-similar coherent
motions. The evidence comes from identifying and analyzing instantaneous
superstructures from large-scale particle image velocimetry datasets acquired
at high Reynolds numbers, capable of capturing streamwise elongated motions
extending up to 12 times the boundary layer thickness. Given the challenge in
identifying the constituent motions of the superstructures based on streamwise
velocity signatures, a new approach is adopted that investigates the
wall-normal velocity fluctuations within these very long motions, which reveals
the constituent motions unambiguously. The conditional streamwise energy
spectra of the wall-normal fluctuations, corresponding exclusively to the
superstructure region, are found to exhibit the well-known
distance-from-the-wall scaling in the intermediate scale range. This indicates
geometrically self-similar motions co-exist within the superstructure region.
The same spectra also exhibit a unique energy enhancement at the outer scales.
Since the wall-normal momentum-carrying eddies do not conform with these scales
in a physical sense, the large-scale energy enhancement is shown to be
associated with spatially clustered/packed organization of self-similar motions
over extended streamwise distances (i.e. concatenation), which plausibly leads
to the appearance of superstructures. The association of the superstructures
with the self-similar motions is further reinforced by computing conditionally
averaged two-point correlations, representing the vertical coherence of the
constituent motions, which are found to match with the mean correlations. The
findings support the prospect for modelling these dynamically significant
motions via data-driven coherent structure-based models.

microscopic tumor cells is an inherently uncertain task in radiotherapy. The
recently proposed \textit{clinical target distribution} (CTD) is an alternative
to the conventional \textit{clinical target volume} (CTV), with initial
promise. Previously, using the CTD in planning has primarily been evaluated in
comparison to a conventionally defined CTV. We propose to compare the CTD
approach against CTV margins of various sizes, dependent on the threshold at
which the tumor infiltration probability is considered relevant. First, a
theoretical framework is presented, concerned with optimizing the trade-off
between the probability of sufficient target coverage and the penalties
associated with high dose. From this framework we derive conventional CTV-based
planning and contrast it with the CTD approach. The approaches are
contextualized further by comparison with established methods for managing
geometric uncertainties. Second, for both a one- and a three-dimensional
phantom, we compare a set of CTD plans created by varying the target objective
function weight against a set of plans created by varying both the target
weight and the CTV margin size. The results show that CTD-based planning gives
slightly inefficient trade-offs between the evaluation criteria for a case in
which near-minimum target dose is the highest priority. However, in a case when
sparing a proximal organ at risk is critical, the CTD is better at maintaining
sufficiently high dose toward the center of the target. We conclude that
CTD-based planning is a computationally efficient method for planning with
respect to delineation uncertainties, but that the inevitable effects on the
dose distribution should not be disregarded.

challenge in nuclear physics because it is a very complex dynamical process,
whose description involves the coupling between intrinsic and collective
degrees of freedom, as well as different quantum-mechanical phenomena. To
improve on the existing data on nuclear fission, we produce fission reactions
of heavy nuclei in inverse kinematics by using quasi-free (p,2p) scattering,
which induce fission through particle-hole excitations that can range from few
to ten's of MeV. The measurement of the four-momenta of the two outgoing
protons allows to reconstruct the excitation energy of the fissioning compound
nucleus and therefore to study the evolution of the fission yields with
temperature. The realization of this kind of experiment requires a complex
experimental setup, providing full isotopic identification of both fission
fragments and an accurate measurement of the momenta of the two outgoing
protons. This was realized recently at the GSI/FAIR facility and here some
preliminary results are presented.

fast nova in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 300. We detected the rise to the peak
(which is rarely observed for very fast novae) in the near-ultraviolet (NUV),
with the first detection just ~2 hours after the eruption started. The peak and
early stages of the decay were also observed in UV and optical bands. The
source rapidly decayed by 2 NUV magnitudes within 3.5 days, making it one of
the fastest novae known. In addition, a likely quiescent counterpart was found
in archival near-infrared Spitzer and VIRCAM images but not in any deep optical
and UV observations, indicating a very red spectral shape in quiescence. The
outburst and quiescence properties suggest that the system is likely a
symbiotic binary. We discuss this new transient in the context of very fast
novae in general and specifically as a promising supernova Type Ia progenitor
candidate, due to its very high inferred WD mass (~1.35 Ms; determined by
comparing this source to other very fast novae).

the trace distance which measures the distinguishability of quantum states. We
apply these results to the dynamics of open quantum systems and construct a
non-Markovianity witness based on the Kolmogorov distance of the P- and
Q-functions. By means of several examples we discuss the performance of this
witness and demonstrate that it is useful in the regime of high entropy states
for which a direct evaluation of the trace distance is typically very

  Models for Clinical Domain via Transfer Learning","Accepted to ClinicalNLP-2023 WS@ACL-2023",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Massively multilingual pre-trained language models (MMPLMs) are developed in
recent years demonstrating superpowers and the pre-knowledge they acquire for
downstream tasks. This work investigates whether MMPLMs can be applied to
clinical domain machine translation (MT) towards entirely unseen languages via
transfer learning. We carry out an experimental investigation using Meta-AI's
MMPLMs ``wmt21-dense-24-wide-en-X and X-en (WMT21fb)'' which were pre-trained
on 7 language pairs and 14 translation directions including English to Czech,
German, Hausa, Icelandic, Japanese, Russian, and Chinese, and the opposite
direction. We fine-tune these MMPLMs towards English-\textit{Spanish} language
pair which \textit{did not exist at all} in their original pre-trained corpora
both implicitly and explicitly. We prepare carefully aligned \textit{clinical}
domain data for this fine-tuning, which is different from their original mixed
domain knowledge. Our experimental result shows that the fine-tuning is very
successful using just 250k well-aligned in-domain EN-ES segments for three
sub-task translation testings: clinical cases, clinical terms, and ontology
concepts. It achieves very close evaluation scores to another MMPLM NLLB from
Meta-AI, which included Spanish as a high-resource setting in the pre-training.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on using MMPLMs towards
\textit{clinical domain transfer-learning NMT} successfully for totally unseen
languages during pre-training.

a crucial but challenging task in drug discovery. This work focuses on blind
flexible selfdocking, where we aim to predict the positions, orientations and
conformations of docked molecules. Traditional physics-based methods usually
suffer from inaccurate scoring functions and high inference cost. Recently,
data-driven methods based on deep learning techniques are attracting growing
interest thanks to their efficiency during inference and promising performance.
These methods usually either adopt a two-stage approach by first predicting the
distances between proteins and ligands and then generating the final
coordinates based on the predicted distances, or directly predicting the global
roto-translation of ligands. In this paper, we take a different route. Inspired
by the resounding success of AlphaFold2 for protein structure prediction, we
propose E3Bind, an end-to-end equivariant network that iteratively updates the
ligand pose. E3Bind models the protein-ligand interaction through careful
consideration of the geometric constraints in docking and the local context of
the binding site. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of our end-to-end trainable model compared to traditional
and recently-proposed deep learning methods.

N\'eel-like near the surface to Bloch-like deeper within the sample. LE-{\mu}SR
reveals that the magnetic field distribution in the first six layers of the
stack is distinct from that in layers further from the surface, quantifying the
depth at which the static and dynamic magnetic structure varies. By increasing
the applied magnetic field, we find a reduction in the volume occupied by

by skyrmions above approximately 180 mT.

paper, Self-Validated Physics-Embedding Network (SVPEN), a general neural
network framework for inverse modeling is proposed. As its name suggests, the
embedded physical forward model ensures that any solution that successfully
passes its validation is physically reasonable. SVPEN operates in two modes:
(a) the inverse function mode offers rapid state estimation as conventional
supervised learning, and (b) the optimization mode offers a way to iteratively
correct estimations that fail the validation process. Furthermore, the
optimization mode provides SVPEN with reconfigurability i.e., replacing
components like neural networks, physical models, and error calculations at
will to solve a series of distinct inverse problems without pretraining. More
than ten case studies in two highly nonlinear and entirely distinct
applications: molecular absorption spectroscopy and Turbofan cycle analysis,
demonstrate the generality, physical reliability, and reconfigurability of
SVPEN. More importantly, SVPEN offers a solid foundation to use existing
physical models within the context of AI, so as to striking a balance between
data-driven and physics-driven models.

applications. To exploit the high reconfigurability of array antennas, multiple
synthesis techniques for arrays operating in the near-field region have been
proposed. Building upon previous works on eigenmode expansions of the radiated
fields, two synthesis methods for the excitations of near-field arrays based on
the definition of an inner product on the electromagnetic fields are
investigated: the ""maximum norm"" and ""minimum error field norm"" methods. The
""maximum norm"" method computes the array excitations that maximize either the
active power flow through a target surface or the electric/magnetic energy
stored in an assigned volume, depending on the adopted inner product. The
performance of the maximum active power flow method is compared with the one of
the simpler conjugate phase method. Furthermore, the limit solution achieved
when the target surface reaches the far-field region is compared against the
""maximum Beam Collection Efficiency"" method. The ""minimum error field norm""
method allows to synthesize a given target field. As an example, the latter
method is used to find the optimal excitation of a Plane Wave Generator with a
spherical quiet zone. The effectiveness and performance of the discussed
synthesis methods are validated through numerical simulations.

specialists' expertise and a tremendous amount of computational resources, not

prevailing, using a much faster but approximate (1D) forward model. We propose
an appraisal tool that indicates zones in the inversion model that are not in
agreement with the multidimensional data and therefore, should not be
interpreted quantitatively. The image appraisal relies on multidimensional
forward modelling to compute a so-called normalized gradient. Large values in
that gradient indicate model parameters that do not fit the true
multidimensionality of the observed data well and should not be interpreted
quantitatively. An alternative approach is proposed to account for imperfect
forward modelling, such that the appraisal tool is computationally inexpensive.
The method is demonstrated on an AEM survey in a salinization context,
revealing possible problematic zones in the estimated fresh-saltwater

quantum spacetime, which is a quite rigid framework to quantum and
renormalization effect of gravity. The theory has a low characteristic energy
scale described by a unique constant: the critical density of the universe. At
low energy long distance (cosmic or galactic) scale, the theory modifies
Einstein's gravity which naturally gives rise to a cosmological constant as a
counter term of the Ricci flow at leading order and an effective scale
dependent Einstein-Hilbert action. In the weak and static gravity limit, the
framework gives rise to a transition trend away from Newtonian gravity and
similar to the MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) around the characteristic
scale. When local curvature is large, Newtonian gravity is recovered. When
local curvature is low enough to be comparable with the asymptotic background
curvature corresponding to the characteristic energy scale, the transition
trend produces the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. For intermediate general
curvature around the background curvature, the interpolating Lagrangian
function yields a similar transition trend to the observed radial acceleration
relation of galaxies. When the baryonic matter density is much lower than the
critical density at the outskirt of a galaxy, there may be a universal
""acceleration floor"" corresponding to the acceleration expansion of the
universe, which differs from MOND at its deep-MOND limit. The critical
acceleration constant $a_0$ introduced in MOND is related to the low
characteristic energy scale of the theory. The cosmological constant gives a
universal leading order contribution to it and the flow effect gives the next
order scale dependent contribution, which equivalently induces the ""cold dark

outperformed the other algorithms, the AM approach is less complex and thus
requires 40 percentage less run-time. Our empirical study demonstrates that the

learnability of concept classes when considering the exact-in-the-ball robust
risk and access to random examples by Gourdeau et al. (2019). In this paper, we
study learning models where the learner is given more power through the use of
local queries, and give the first distribution-free algorithms that perform
robust empirical risk minimization (ERM) for this notion of robustness. The
first learning model we consider uses local membership queries (LMQ), where the
learner can query the label of points near the training sample. We show that,
under the uniform distribution, LMQs do not increase the robustness threshold
of conjunctions and any superclass, e.g., decision lists and halfspaces. Faced
with this negative result, we introduce the local equivalence query (LEQ)
oracle, which returns whether the hypothesis and target concept agree in the
perturbation region around a point in the training sample, as well as a
counterexample if it exists. We show a separation result: on one hand, if the
query radius $\lambda$ is strictly smaller than the adversary's perturbation
budget $\rho$, then distribution-free robust learning is impossible for a wide
variety of concept classes; on the other hand, the setting $\lambda=\rho$
allows us to develop robust ERM algorithms. We then bound the query complexity
of these algorithms based on online learning guarantees and further improve
these bounds for the special case of conjunctions. We finish by giving robust
learning algorithms for halfspaces with margins on both $\{0,1\}^n$ and
$\mathbb{R}^n$.

knowledge gained by any quantum polynomial-time verifier in an interactive
protocol can be simulated by a quantum polynomial-time algorithm. One drawback
of this definition is that it allows the simulator to consume significantly
more computational resources than the verifier. We argue that this drawback
renders the existing notion of quantum zero-knowledge not viable for certain
settings, especially when dealing with near-term quantum devices.
  In this work, we initiate a fine-grained notion of post-quantum
zero-knowledge that is more compatible with near-term quantum devices. We
introduce the notion of $(s,f)$ space-bounded quantum zero-knowledge. In this
new notion, we require that an $s$-qubit malicious verifier can be simulated by
a quantum polynomial-time algorithm that uses at most $f(s)$-qubits, for some
function $f(\cdot)$, and no restriction on the amount of the classical memory
consumed by either the verifier or the simulator. We explore this notion and
establish both positive and negative results:
  - For verifiers with logarithmic quantum space $s$ and (arbitrary) polynomial
classical space, we show that $(s,f)$-space-bounded QZK, for $f(s)=2s$, can be
achieved based on the existence of post-quantum one-way functions. Moreover,
our protocol runs in constant rounds.
  - For verifiers with super-logarithmic quantum space $s$, assuming the
existence of post-quantum secure one-way functions, we show that
$(s,f)$-space-bounded QZK protocols, with fully black-box simulation (classical
analogue of black-box simulation) can only be achieved for languages in BQP.

sufficient to model temporal clues as the appearance contents can be easily
reconstructed from a single frame. To overcome this limitation, we present
Masked Motion Encoding (MME), a new pre-training paradigm that reconstructs
both appearance and motion information to explore temporal clues. In MME, we
focus on addressing two critical challenges to improve the representation
performance: 1) how to well represent the possible long-term motion across
multiple frames; and 2) how to obtain fine-grained temporal clues from sparsely
sampled videos. Motivated by the fact that human is able to recognize an action
by tracking objects' position changes and shape changes, we propose to
reconstruct a motion trajectory that represents these two kinds of change in
the masked regions. Besides, given the sparse video input, we enforce the model
to reconstruct dense motion trajectories in both spatial and temporal
dimensions. Pre-trained with our MME paradigm, the model is able to anticipate
long-term and fine-grained motion details. Code is available at

While both have been studied extensively in the past, we combine them into one
model by performing three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of
giant planet hosting discs that are undergoing X-ray photo-evaporation, with
the goal to analyse the interactions between both mechanisms. In order to study
the effect on observational diagnostics, we produce synthetic observations of
commonly used wind-tracing forbidden emission lines with detailed radiative
transfer and photo-ionisation calculations. We find that a sufficiently massive
giant planet carves a gap in the gas disc that is deep enough to affect the
structure and kinematics of the pressure-driven photo-evaporative wind
significantly. This effect can be strong enough to be visible in the synthetic
high-resolution observations of some of our wind diagnostic lines, such as the
[OI] 6300 \r{A} or [SII] 6730 \r{A} lines. When the disc is observed at
inclinations around 40{\deg} and higher, the spectral line profiles may exhibit
a peak in the redshifted part of the spectrum, which cannot easily be explained
by simple wind models alone. Moreover, massive planets can induce asymmetric
substructures within the disc and the photo-evaporative wind, giving rise to
temporal variations of the line profiles that can be strong enough to be
observable on timescales of less than a quarter of the planet's orbital period.

which provides valuable geometric properties of the depth contours (such as
convexity and rotational equivariance) and a Bahadur-type representation of the
quantiles. Their concept is canonical for rotationally symmetric depth
contours. However, it also produces rotationally symmetric depth contours when
the underlying distribution is not rotationally symmetric. We solve this lack
of flexibility for distributions with elliptical depth contours. The basic idea
is to deform the elliptic contours by a diffeomorphic mapping to rotationally
symmetric contours, thus reverting to the canonical case in Ley et al. [1]. A
Monte Carlo simulation study confirms our results. We use our method to
evaluate the ellipticity of depth contours and for trimming of directional

the practical relevance.

be Fickian or non-Fickian due to the homogeneity or heterogeneity of the porous
medium conductivity layout. Yet, evidence shows that preferential flows that
funnel the transport occur in heterogeneous and homogenous cases. We model the
Darcy scale transport using a 2D conductivity field ranging from homogenous to
heterogeneous and find that these preferential flows bifurcate, leaving voids
where particles do not invade while forming a tortuous path. The fraction of
bifurcations decreases downflow and reaches an asymptotical value, which scales
as a power-law with the heterogeneity level. We show that the same power-law
scaling of the bifurcations to heterogeneity level appears for the void
fraction, tortuosity, and fractal dimension analysis with the same
heterogeneity level. We conclude that the scaling with the heterogeneity is the
dominant feature in the preferential flow geometry, which will lead to
variations in weighting times for the transport and eventually to anomalous
transport.

achieve peak sensitivities during sensor operation. The usual method for
determining a quantum system's decoherence rate involves a suite of experiments
probing the entire expected range of the parameter, and extracting the
resulting estimation in post-processing. Here we present an adaptive Bayesian
approach, based on a simple analytical update rule, to estimate the key
decoherence timescales (T$_1$, T$_2^*$ and T$_2$) in a quantum system in real
time, using information gained in preceding experiments. This approach reduces
the time required to reach a given uncertainty by a factor up to an order of

protocol of curve fitting. A further speed-up of a factor $\sim 2$ can be
realised by performing our optimisation with respect to sensitivity as opposed
to variance.
  To experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our online adaptive

methods use an encoding of k-mode-samples, which under-represents the full

whether one of the predictions is similar to the ground-truth, but allow
additional unlikely predictions to occur, over-representing unlikely

to encode the full distribution, and optimising predictions using both
probabilistic and closest-mode measures. These objectives respectively optimise
probabilistic accuracy and the ability to capture distinct behaviours, and
there is a challenging trade-off between them. We are able to solve both

required to bid optimally are only available to the auction designer, and an
advertiser can only participate by setting performance objectives (clicks,
conversions, etc.) for the campaign.
  In this paper, we focus on value-maximizing campaigns with
return-on-investment (ROI) constraints, which is widely adopted in many
global-scale auto-bidding platforms. Through theoretical analysis and empirical
experiments on both synthetic and realistic data, we find that second price
auction exhibits many undesirable properties and loses its dominant theoretical
advantages in single-item scenarios. In particular, second price auction brings
equilibrium multiplicity, non-monotonicity, vulnerability to exploitation by
both bidders and even auctioneers, and PPAD-hardness for the system to reach a
steady-state. We also explore the broader impacts of the auto-bidding mechanism
beyond efficiency and strategyproofness. In particular, the multiplicity of
equilibria and the input sensitivity make advertisers' utilities unstable. In
addition, the interference among both bidders and advertising slots introduces
bias into A/B testing, which hinders the development of even non-bidding
components of the platform. The aforementioned phenomena have been widely
observed in practice, and our results indicate that one of the reasons might be
intrinsic to the underlying auto-bidding mechanism. To deal with these
challenges, we provide suggestions and candidate solutions for practitioners.

depends on the per-frame 2D pose estimation. In this paper, we present a
Transformer-based pose uplifting scheme that can operate on temporally sparse

how masked token modeling can be utilized for temporal upsampling within

mean-field models, there is a large and growing body of evidence which

nucleon-nucleon structures. The role of nucleonic structures was first
suggested by Heidmann in 1950 to explain pick-up reactions of energetic
nucleons. Since then a steady flux of new experimental evidence has confirmed
the presence of similar structures inside atomic nuclei, dominated by
correlations between pairs of nucleons. The role of these internal
nucleon-nucleon correlations has been established using various energetic
probes like photons, pions, leptons and hadrons. These correlated structures
are essential for understanding the interaction of particles with nuclei and
their presence provides an explanation of many specific nuclear phenomena
including backscattered protons, copious deuteron production, sub-threshold
particle production, neutrino interactions with nuclei and the EMC effect. On
the theoretical side, these measurements have stimulated a large number of
phenomenological models specifically devised to address these enigmatic
observations. While reviews exist for specific interactions, there is currently

estimating the impact of disruptions across multi-transport modes is a
challenging problem due to a dis-aggregated modelling approach applied to only
individual modes at a time. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a new
integrated modelling framework for a multi-modal traffic state estimation and
evaluation of the disruption impact across all modes under various traffic
conditions. First, we propose an iterative trip assignment model to elucidate
the association between travel demand and travel behaviour, including a
multi-modal origin-to-destination estimation for private and public transport.
Secondly, we provide a practical multi-modal travel demand re-adjustment that
takes the mode shift of the affected travellers into consideration. The pros
and cons of the mode shift strategy are showcased via several scenario-based
transport simulating experiments. The results show that a well-balanced mode
shift with flexible routing and early announcements of detours so that
travellers can plan ahead can significantly benefit all travellers by a delay
time reduction of 46%, while a stable route assignment maintains a higher
average traffic flow and the inactive mode-route choice help relief density
under the traffic disruptions.

investigation regarding primarily the $S_8$ tension between cosmic microwave
background (CMB) and certain large-scale structure measurements. The decay into
one massive and one (or more) massless daughter particle(s) leads to a
suppression of the power spectrum in the late universe that depends on the
relative mass splitting $\epsilon=(1-m^2/M^2)/2$ between the mother and massive
daughter particle as well as the lifetime $\tau$. In this work we investigate
the impact of the BOSS DR14 one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest flux power
spectrum on the DCDM model using a conservative effective model approach to
account for astrophysical uncertainties. Since the suppression of the power
spectrum due to decay builds up at low redshift, we find that regions in
parameter space that address the $S_8$ tension can be well compatible with the
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Nevertheless, for values of the degeneracy parameter
$\epsilon\sim 0.1-0.5\%$, for which the power suppression occurs within the
scales probed by BOSS Lyman-$\alpha$ data, we find improved constraints
compared to previous CMB and galaxy clustering analyses, obtaining $\tau\gtrsim
18$ Gyrs for small mass splitting. Furthermore, our analysis of the BOSS
Lyman-$\alpha$ flux power spectrum allows for values $\tau\sim 10^2$ Gyrs,
$\epsilon\sim 1\%$, that have been found to be preferred by a combination of
Planck and galaxy clustering data with a KiDS prior on $S_8$, and we even find
a marginal preference within this regime.

Second, we propose a Laplacian Matrix Mixed-up Module (LM3) to fuse the

Multi-echo readouts optimized for water-fat separation and quantification were

Pilot Tone navigation was used to extract cardiac and respiratory motion
states. Following a XD-GRASP based image reconstruction of the separate echoes,
fat fraction, water fraction, R2star and B0 maps, as well as fat and water

in 10 healthy volunteers at 1.5T and compared to a free-breathing ECG-triggered
5-echo acquisition. RESULTS The acquisition was successfully validated in vivo,
with motion compensation achieved over all collected echoes, in both
respiratory and cardiac dimensions. Pilot Tone navigation provided respiratory
and cardiac signals in good agreement (r=0.954 and r=0.783, respectively) with
self-gating signal extraction based on the MR data of the first echo. The
framework enabled pericardial fat imaging and quantification across the cardiac

renormalized Casimir free energy as well as other thermodynamics quantities,
namely, internal energy and entropy. For each one of them we also investigate
the limits of high and low temperatures. At high temperatures we found that the
renormalized Casimir free energy presents classical contributions, along with a
logarithmic term. Also in this limit, the internal energy presents a classical
contribution and the entropy a logarithmic term in addition to a classical
contribution as well. Conversely, at low temperatures, it is shown that both
the renormalized Casimir free energy and internal energy are dominated by the
vacuum energy at zero temperature. It is also shown that the entropy obeys the
third law of thermodynamics.

optomechanical coupling has been demonstrated, assisted by alternating
mechanical nonlinear cooling and linear heating. Such levitated optomechanical
(LOM) devices, with minimal noises in high vacuum, can allow flexible control
of large-mass objects without any internal discrete energy levels. However,
untill now, it is still elusive to realize phonon lasing with levitated
microscale objects, due to much stronger optical scattering losses. Here, by
employing a Yb3+-doped active system, we report the first experiment on
nonlinear multi-frequency phonon lasers with a micro-size sphere governed
instead by dissipative LOM coupling. In this work, active gain plays a key role
since not only 3-order enhancement can be achieved for the amplitude of the
fundamental-mode phonon lasing, compared with the passive device, but also
nonlinear mechanical harmonics can emerge spontaneously above the lasing
threshold. Furthermore, for the first time, coherent correlations of phonons
are observed for both the fundamental mode and its harmonics. Our work drives
the field of LOM technology into a new regime where it becomes promising to
engineer collective motional properties of typical micro-size objects, such as
atmospheric particulates and living cells, for a wide range of applications in

is clumpy, forming gravitationally-bound halos distributed within the Galaxy.
The practical difficulties inherent in testing this hypothesis stem from the
fact that, on astrophysical scales, dark matter is solely observable via its
gravitational interaction with other objects.
  This thesis presents a gravitational-lensing-based solution for the mapping
and characterisation of low-mass, dark matter halos via their signature in
millisecond pulsar observations. This involves: first, determining the time
delay and magnification surfaces generated in the frame of reference of the
halo; second, obtaining the corresponding pulsar signature in the reference
frame of the observer; and last, generalising the method to multiple halos at
varying distances. We discuss whether the delay is observationally detectable
for both single and multiple lenses.
  The key dependency of the time delay is the density profile adopted for the
halo. I utilise a variety of proposed halo mass profiles -- elliptical,
Schwarzschild, horizontal-disc lenses and the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density
profile -- which are applicable over a broad range of halo masses. I
demonstrate the use of Hankel transforms to increase the efficiency of the
relativistic time delay calculation.
  The observational signatures of such halos are best identified using
millisecond pulsars due to their high rotational frequencies and period
stability. My method does not require major adjustments when searching for
signs of lensing, thus it is unnecessary to implement specialist data reduction
pipelines. Thus we can leverage data from both existing and future surveys
easily. This method is readily extensible to nearby globular clusters and
galaxies, pending improvements in pulsar detection at such distances.

due to two major mechanisms breaking inversion symmetry, i.e., static and
dynamic, and the presence of heavy elements contributing to significant SOC. We
find non-negligible spin-splitting effects in the conduction band minimum (CBm)
and valence band maximum (VBM) for hybrid perovskites. For a deeper
understanding of the observed spin-splitting, the spin textures are analyzed
and Rashba coefficients are calculated. We find that Dresselhaus effect comes
into play in substituted hybrids in addition to the usual Rashba effect
observed in pristine compound. We also observe that the strength of Rashba
spin-splitting can be substantially tuned on application of uniaxial strain
($\pm5\%$). Also, we notice that some of the hybrids are mechanically stable
and ductile. Hence these hybrid perovskites can prove to be potent for
perovskite-based spintronic applications.

  Conference (Middleware '22)",,,,"cs.LG cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Federated Learning (FL) is a popular approach for distributed deep learning
that prevents the pooling of large amounts of data in a central server. FL
relies on clients to update a global model using their local datasets.
Classical FL algorithms use a central federator that, for each training round,
waits for all clients to send their model updates before aggregating them. In
practical deployments, clients might have different computing powers and
network capabilities, which might lead slow clients to become performance
bottlenecks. Previous works have suggested to use a deadline for each learning
round so that the federator ignores the late updates of slow clients, or so
that clients send partially trained models before the deadline. To speed up the
training process, we instead propose Aergia, a novel approach where slow
clients (i) freeze the part of their model that is the most computationally
intensive to train; (ii) train the unfrozen part of their model; and (iii)
offload the training of the frozen part of their model to a faster client that
trains it using its own dataset. The offloading decisions are orchestrated by
the federator based on the training speed that clients report and on the
similarities between their datasets, which are privately evaluated thanks to a
trusted execution environment. We show through extensive experiments that
Aergia maintains high accuracy and significantly reduces the training time
under heterogeneous settings by up to 27% and 53% compared to FedAvg and TiFL,
respectively.

the layout awareness of the model, we integrate a spatial-aware disentangled

the $1$ space dimensional case but allow for initial data taken in a
Wasserstein space of probability measures. We first consider the case of smooth
nonlocal interaction potentials, not subject to any symmetry condition, and
prove existence and uniqueness. The concept of solutions relies on a stickiness
condition in case of collisions, in the spirit of previous works in the
literature. The result uses concepts from classical Hilbert space theory of
gradient flows (cf. Brezis [7]) and a trick used in [4]. We then consider a
large-time and large-damping scaled version of our system and prove convergence
to solutions to the corresponding first order system. Finally, we consider the
case of Newtonian potentials -- subject to symmetry of the cross-interaction
potentials -- and external convex potentials. After showing existence in the
sticky particles framework in the spirit of [4], we prove convergence for large

share a common technical framework in that solutions are considered in a
Lagrangian framework, which allows to estimate the behavior of solutions via
$L^2$ estimates of the pseudo-inverse variables corresponding to the two
densities. In particular, due to this technique, the large-damping result holds
under a rather weak condition on the initial data, which does not require

current sheet position. We find that the HMI runs are globally performing

runs perform better for the streamers' edges, GONG-ADAPT for polar coronal

metallicity in the local Universe, and that the grain size distributions of the
Milky Way (MW)-like sample become similar to the so-called MRN distribution
that reproduces the observed MW extinction curve. Our model, however, tends to
overpredict the dust mass function at the massive end at redshift $z\lesssim

properties (metallicity, specific star formation rate, gas fraction, and
stellar mass), and observe a clear trend of large-grain-dominated,

metallicity, the grain size distribution tends to have larger fractions of

they also show that with special initial conditions, loops of string can be
created for which classical field radiation is suppressed, and which behave
like Nambu-Goto (NG) strings with a dominant decay channel into gravitational

high-energy particles and gravitational waves. Here we adopt a simple
parametrisation of the AH string network allowing for both particle and
gravitational wave production. With a reference to a specific model for NG-like
loop distribution, this sets the basis for a ``multi-messenger'' investigation
of this model. We find that, in order to explain the NANOGrav detection of a
possible gravitational wave background, while satisfying the constraint on
NG-like loop production from simulations and bounds from the cosmic microwave

fraction of the NG-like loops $f_{\rm NG}$ should satisfy $G\mu f_{\rm

for such string tensions, constraints from the diffuse gamma-ray background
(DGRB) indicate that more than 97$\%$ of the total network energy should be
converted to dark matter (DM) or dark radiation. We also consider joint
constraints on the annihilation cross-section, the mass, and the relic
abundance of DM produced by decays of strings. For example, for a DM mass of
500 GeV, the observed relic abundance can be explained by decaying AH strings

the minimum number of function evaluations required to make the worst-case
error less than or equal to a tolerance $\varepsilon$ grows only polynomially
with respect to $\varepsilon^{-1}$ and $d$. It is important to remark that the
function space $F_d$ is unweighted, that is, all variables contribute equally
to the norm of functions. Our tractability result is in contrast to those for
most of the unweighted integration problems studied in the literature, in which
polynomial tractability does not hold and the problem suffers from the curse of

explicit quasi-Monte Carlo rule that attains a desired worst-case error bound.

a specially chosen cascade of both active and passive challenges to video
conference participants. Active challenges include inducing changes in face
occlusion, face expression, view angle, and ambiance; passive challenges
include digital manipulation of the webcam feed. The challenges are designed to
target vulnerabilities in the structure of modern deepfake generators and
create perceptible artifacts for the human eye while inducing robust signals
for ML-based automatic deepfake detectors. We present a comprehensive taxonomy
of a large set of challenge tasks, which reveals a natural hierarchy among
different challenges. Our system leverages this hierarchy by cascading
progressively more demanding challenges to a suspected deepfake. We evaluate

and it is often cited to explain the gravitational collapse of the wave
function and the localization of macroscopic objects. However, this model is
completely nonrelativistic. Thus, in order to study whether the relativistic
effects may spoil the properties of this system, we derive a modification of
the Schr\""odinger-Newton equation by considering certain relativistic
corrections up to the first post-Newtonian order. The construction of the model
begins by considering the Hamiltonian of a relativistic particle propagating on
a curved background. For simplicity, the background metric is assumed to be
spherically symmetric and it is then expanded up to the first post-Newtonian
order. After performing the canonical quantization of the system, and following
the usual interpretation, the square of the module of the wave function defines
a mass distribution, which in turn is the source of the Poisson equation for
the gravitational potential. As in the nonrelativistic case, this construction
couples the Poisson and the Schr\""odinger equations and leads to a complicated
nonlinear system. Hence, the dynamics of an initial Gaussian wave packet is
then numerically analyzed. We observe that the natural dispersion of the wave
function is slower than in the nonrelativistic case. Furthermore, for those
cases that reach a final localized stationary state, the peak of the wave
function happens to be located at a smaller radius. Therefore, the relativistic
corrections effectively contribute to increase the self-gravitation of the
particle and strengthen the validity of this model as an explanation for the
gravitational localization of the wave function.

additional assumptions such as considering the functional relations to be
constrained as nonlinear with additive noise. In this case, the Hessian of the
data log-likelihood can be used for finding leaf nodes in a causal graph.
Topological ordering approaches for causal discovery exploit this by performing
graph discovery in two steps, first sequentially identifying nodes in reverse
order of depth (topological ordering), and secondly pruning the potential
relations. This is more efficient since the search is performed over a
permutation rather than a graph space. However, existing computational methods
for obtaining the Hessian still do not scale as the number of variables and the
number of samples are increased. Therefore, inspired by recent innovations in
diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), we propose DiffAN, a topological
ordering algorithm that leverages DPMs. Further, we introduce theory for
updating the learned Hessian without re-training the neural network, and we
show that computing with a subset of samples gives an accurate approximation of
the ordering, which allows scaling to datasets with more samples and variables.
We show empirically that our method scales exceptionally well to datasets with
up to $500$ nodes and up to $10^5$ samples while still performing on par over
small datasets with state-of-the-art causal discovery methods. Implementation

scalability of Bayesian pseudocoresets is not yet validated in realistic

hand, dataset distillation methods similarly construct a small dataset such
that the optimization using the synthetic dataset converges to a solution with
performance competitive with optimization using full data. Although dataset
distillation has been empirically verified in large-scale settings, the
framework is restricted to point estimates, and their adaptation to Bayesian
inference has not been explored. This paper casts two representative dataset
distillation algorithms as approximations to methods for constructing
pseudocoresets by minimizing specific divergence measures: reverse KL

sizes simultaneously rather than using the nonlinear cascade mechanism to
obtain multi-scale structures, as it is the case for regular grids. The

findings stemming from the experimental and computational studies conducted on
these grids. This work presents experimental wind tunnel and computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) studies of the turbulent flow generated by a space-filling
fractal square grid. The experimental work includes Particle Image Velocimetry
(PIV) and hot-wire measurements. In addition, Delayed Detached Eddy Simulations
(DDES) with a Spalart-Allmaras background turbulence model are conducted using
the open-source package OpenFOAM. This is the first time DDES simulations are
used to simulate and characterize the turbulent flow generated by a fractal
grid. Finally, this article reports on the extensive statistical study and the
direct comparison between the experimentally and numerically acquired time

is to validate our computational results and provide enhanced insight into the
complexity of the multi-scale generation of turbulence using a fractal grid
with a low number of fractal iterations. In particular, we investigate the
different turbulent structures and their complex interaction in the near-grid
region or the production regime of the fractal grid flow.

successfully compress PLMs to extremely high sparsity with little performance

prune PLMs while fine-tuning the remaining weights. In this work, we argue
fine-tuning is redundant for first-order pruning, since first-order pruning is
sufficient to converge PLMs to downstream tasks without fine-tuning. Under this
motivation, we propose Static Model Pruning (SMP), which only uses first-order
pruning to adapt PLMs to downstream tasks while achieving the target sparsity

sparsity and outperforms zero-order methods. Meanwhile, SMP is more parameter
efficient than other methods due to it does not require fine-tuning.

radio imaging spectroscopy data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)
and complementary X-ray imaging and spectroscopy data. The radio QPPs, observed
by the VLA in the 1--2 GHz with a subsecond cadence, are shown as three
spatially distinct sources with different physical characteristics. Two radio
sources are located near the conjugate footpoints of the erupting magnetic flux
rope with opposite senses of polarization. One of the sources displays a QPP
behavior with a ~5 s period. The third radio source, located at the top of the
postflare arcade, coincides with the location of an X-ray source and shares a
similar period of ~25--45 s. We show that the two oppositely polarized radio
sources are likely due to coherent electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission. On
the other hand, the looptop QPP source, observed in both radio and X-rays, is
consistent with incoherent gyrosynchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission,
respectively. We conclude that the concurrent, but spatially distinct QPP
sources must involve multiple mechanisms which operate in different magnetic

previous methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on
the multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing

ignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by

features from various bio-signals that are indicators of stress. Recently, deep
learning models have also been proposed to detect stress. Typically, stress
models are trained and validated on the same dataset, often involving one
stressful scenario. However, it is not practical to collect stress data for
every scenario. So, it is crucial to study the generalizability of these models
and determine to what extent they can be used in other scenarios. In this
paper, we explore the generalization capabilities of Electrocardiogram
(ECG)-based deep learning models and models based on handcrafted ECG features,
i.e., Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features. To this end, we train three HRV
models and two deep learning models that use ECG signals as input. We use ECG
signals from two popular stress datasets - WESAD and SWELL-KW - differing in
terms of stressors and recording devices. First, we evaluate the models using
leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation using training and validation
samples from the same dataset. Next, we perform a cross-dataset validation of
the models, that is, LOSO models trained on the WESAD dataset are validated
using SWELL-KW samples and vice versa. While deep learning models achieve the
best results on the same dataset, models based on HRV features considerably
outperform them on data from a different dataset. This trend is observed for
all the models on both datasets. Therefore, HRV models are a better choice for
stress recognition in applications that are different from the dataset
scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to compare the
cross-dataset generalizability between ECG-based deep learning models and HRV

results, those algorithms resort to biased stochastic gradient descent
procedures and thus lack theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we formalize
and study the VR-IWAE bound, a generalization of the Importance Weighted
Auto-Encoder (IWAE) bound. We show that the VR-IWAE bound enjoys several
desirable properties and notably leads to the same stochastic gradient descent
procedure as the VR bound in the reparameterized case, but this time by relying
on unbiased gradient estimators. We then provide two complementary theoretical
analyses of the VR-IWAE bound and thus of the standard IWAE bound. Those
analyses shed light on the benefits or lack thereof of these bounds. Lastly, we
illustrate our theoretical claims over toy and real-data examples.

SILCC-Zoom molecular cloud simulations. Using a chemical network of 39 species
and 299 reactions (including freeze-out of CO and H$_2$O), and a novel
iterative algorithm to reconstruct a filled density grid from sparse tracer
particle data, we produce time-dependent density distributions for various
species. We focus upon the evolution of HCO$^+$, which is a critical formation
reactant of CO but is not typically modeled on-the-fly. We analyse the
evolution of the tracer particles to assess the regime in which HCO$^+$
production preferentially takes place. We find that the HCO$^+$ content of the
cold molecular gas forms in situ around $n_\textrm{HCO$^+$}\simeq10^3$-$10^4$
cm$^{-3}$, over a time-scale of approximately 1 Myr, rather than being
distributed to this density regime via turbulent mixing from deeper in the
cloud. We further show that the dominant HCO$^+$ formation pathway is dependent
on the visual extinction, with the reaction H$_3^+$ + CO contributing 90% of
the total HCO$^+$ production flux above $A_\textrm{V,3D}=3$. Using our novel
grid reconstruction algorithm, we produce the very first maps of the HCO$^+$
column density, $N$(HCO$^+$), and show that it reaches values as high as
$10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$. We find that 50% of the HCO$^+$ mass is located in an
$A_\textrm{V}$-range of $\sim$10-30, and in a density range of
$10^{3.5}$-$10^{4.5}$ cm$^{-3}$. Finally, we compare our $N$(HCO$^+$) maps to
recent observations of W49A and find good agreement.

a local controller only depends on the local system behavior. Regularity of

Horizontal Divergent Flow (HDF), can be confidently detected using data from
the Solar Dynamics Observatory's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI).
Initially, we follow previous studies using the thresholding method, which
searches for significant increases in the number of pixels that display a
specific line-of-sight velocity. We expand this method to more velocity windows
and conduct a basic parameter study investigating the effect of cadence on the
inferred results. Our findings agree with previous studies with $37.5$% of ARs
displaying a HDF, with average lead times between the HDF and flux emergence of
$58$ minutes. We present a new potential signature of flux emergence which
manifests as cadence-independent transient disruptions to the amplitudes of
multiple velocity windows and recover potential pre-emergence signatures for 10

To tackle the challenge, we propose a task prefix guided multi-task

extensive experiments on 40 datasets, which show that our model can not only
serve as the strong foundation backbone for a wide range of tasks but also be
feasible as a probing tool for analyzing task relationships. The task

in the nonlinear regime is investigated, highlighting its dependence on the PAS
block length and the interaction with carrier phase recovery (CPR). Different
PAS implementations are considered, based on different distribution matching
(DM) techniques-namely, sphere shaping, shell mapping with different number of
shells, and constant composition DM-and amplitude-to-symbol maps. When CPR is
not included, PAS with optimal block length provides a nonlinear shaping gain
with respect to a linearly optimized PAS (with infinite block length); among
the considered DM techniques, the largest gain is obtained with sphere shaping.
On the other hand, the nonlinear shaping gain becomes smaller, or completely
vanishes, when CPR is included, meaning that in this case all the considered
implementations achieve a similar performance for a sufficiently long block
length. Similar results are obtained in different link configurations (1x180km,
15x80km, and 27x80km single-mode-fiber links), and also including laser phase
noise, except when in-line dispersion compensation is used. Furthermore, we
define a new metric, the nonlinear phase noise (NPN) metric, which is based on
the frequency resolved logarithmic perturbation models and explains the
interaction of CPR and PAS. We show that the NPN metric is highly correlated
with the performance of the system. Our results suggest that, in general, the
optimization of PAS in the nonlinear regime should always account for the
presence of a CPR algorithm. In this case, the reduction of the rate loss
(obtained by using sphere shaping and increasing the DM block length) turns out
to be more important than the mitigation of the nonlinear phase noise (obtained
by using constant-energy DMs and reducing the block length), the latter being
already granted by the CPR algorithm.

a single spin-flip influences other spins not instantly but after some delay.
This implies that the sign of the exchange interaction changes, leading to

characterisation of a broad range of novel high-quality compounds that feature
increasing complexity. Determination of the band structure parameters of such
complex materials is a major ingredient required for quantitative theory. This
task currently presents a formidable challenge: ab initio methods often do not
provide quantitatively accurate values of parameters, whereas inferring band
structure parameters from experiments is hindered by the complexity of the band
structure and indirect nature of experimental probes. In this work we propose a
general framework for determination of band structure parameters from
experimental data based on deep neural networks. As a specific example we apply
our method to the penetration field capacitance measurement of trilayer
graphene that effectively probes its density of states. First, we demonstrate
that a trained deep network gives accurate predictions for the penetration
field capacitance as a function of tight-binding parameters. Next, we use the
fast and accurate predictions from the trained network to automatically
determine tight-binding parameters directly from experimental data, with
extracted parameters being in a good agreement with values in the literature.
We conclude by discussing potential applications of our method to other
materials and experimental techniques beyond penetration field capacitance.

existing approaches, the metric-based method aims to train an embedding network
that can make similar samples close while dissimilar samples as far as possible
and achieves promising results. FSL is characterized by using only a few images
to train a model that can generalize to novel classes in image classification
problems, but this setting makes it difficult to learn the visual features that
can identify the images' appearance variations. The model training is likely to
move in the wrong direction, as the images in an identical semantic class may
have dissimilar appearances, whereas the images in different semantic classes
may share a similar appearance. We argue that FSL can benefit from additional
semantic features to learn discriminative feature representations. Thus, this
study proposes a multi-task learning approach to view semantic features of
label text as an auxiliary task to help boost the performance of the FSL task.
Our proposed model uses word-embedding representations as semantic features to
help train the embedding network and a semantic cross-attention module to
bridge the semantic features into the typical visual modal. The proposed
approach is simple, but produces excellent results. We apply our proposed
approach to two previous metric-based FSL methods, all of which can
substantially improve performance. The source code for our model is accessible
from github.

Transformer architectures that their activation maps are sparse. By activation
map we refer to the intermediate output of the multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs)
after a ReLU activation function, and by ""sparse"" we mean that on average very
few entries (e.g., 3.0% for T5-Base and 6.3% for ViT-B16) are nonzero for each
input to MLP. Moreover, larger Transformers with more layers and wider MLP
hidden dimensions are sparser as measured by the percentage of nonzero entries.
Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that the emergence of sparsity is
a prevalent phenomenon that occurs for both natural language processing and
vision tasks, on both training and evaluation data, for Transformers of various
configurations, at layers of all depth levels, as well as for other
architectures including MLP-mixers and 2-layer MLPs. We show that sparsity also
emerges using training datasets with random labels, or with random inputs, or
with infinite amount of data, demonstrating that sparsity is not a result of a
specific family of datasets. We discuss how sparsity immediately implies a way
to significantly reduce the FLOP count and improve efficiency for Transformers.
Moreover, we demonstrate perhaps surprisingly that enforcing an even sparser
activation via Top-k thresholding with a small value of k brings a collection
of desired but missing properties for Transformers, namely less sensitivity to
noisy training data, more robustness to input corruptions, and better
calibration for their prediction confidence.

that have grown subcritically over geological time scales and under evolving
stress fields. In mechanically layered systems, such fractures can either
become layer-bound or penetrate into adjacent strata. The growth of fractures
in brittle materials is generally dependent on the energy release rate, however
no closed form analytical solutions exist for these when a crack tip is in the
proximity of a material interface. In this study, we present new empirical
formulas for calculating the energy release rate at the tip of a crack
perpendicular to a material interface in a symmetric 3-layer system. In these
formulas, the normalized energy release rate is expressed as the product of a
base term that integrates the normalized stiffness modulus over the crack
length, and a correction factor that accounts for the presence of a material
interface. The latter is assumed to be dependent on two quantities: the ratio
of the crack length to the inner layer thickness, and the contrast in material
stiffness between the inner and outer layers. The correction factors are
obtained by fitting the parameters of carefully chosen expressions to a set of
finite element solutions in order to yield predictions that are accurate to
within one percent of the numerical results.

topological insulators and Weyl semi-metals experimentally realized in 3D

quantum Hall effect in 4D. So far, topological properties linked with the 4D
Hall effect have been revealed via geometrical charge pump experiments in 2D
systems. A truly 4D Hall system has also been realized using electronic
circuits - however, no direct evidence of topological quantization has been
reported. Here, we engineer an atomic quantum Hall system evolving in 4D, by
coupling with light fields two spatial dimensions and two synthetic ones
encoded in the electronic spin $J = 8$ of dysprosium atoms. We measure the
characteristic properties of a 4D quantum Hall system, namely the quantization
of its electromagnetic non-linear response by a second Chern number, and the
special nature of its 3D hyperedge modes, which combine ballistic motion along
one orientation and insulating behaviour in the two remaining directions. We
also probe low-lying excitations, revealing non-planar cyclotron orbits in
contrast with their circular equivalents in $D\leq3$. Our findings pave the way
to the exploration of interacting quantum Hall systems in 4D, from the

of recovering ground-plane trajectories of pedestrians of a crowd and their
observer in the same crowd just from the observed ego-centric video. View
birdification becomes essential for mobile robot navigation and localization in
dense crowds where the static background is hard to see and reliably track. It
is challenging mainly for two reasons; i) absolute trajectories of pedestrians
are entangled with the movement of the observer which needs to be decoupled
from their observed relative movements in the ego-centric video, and ii) a
crowd motion model describing the pedestrian movement interactions is specific
to the scene yet unknown a priori. For this, we introduce a Transformer-based
network referred to as ViewBirdiformer which implicitly models the crowd motion
through self-attention and decomposes relative 2D movement observations onto
the ground-plane trajectories of the crowd and the camera through
cross-attention between views. Most important, ViewBirdiformer achieves view
birdification in a single forward pass which opens the door to accurate
real-time, always-on situational awareness. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that ViewBirdiformer achieves accuracy similar to or better than
state-of-the-art with three orders of magnitude reduction in execution time.

information about the process or phenomena that generated these patterns. In
manufacturing, these patterns can be intentionally introduced as a design
feature, or they can be a byproduct of a specific process. Since surface
texture has significant impact on the mechanical properties and the longevity
of the workpiece, it is important to develop tools for quantifying surface
patterns and, when applicable, comparing them to their nominal counterparts.
While existing tools may be able to indicate the existence of a pattern, they
typically do not provide more information about the pattern structure, or how
much it deviates from a nominal pattern. Further, prior works do not provide
automatic or algorithmic approaches for quantifying other pattern
characteristics such as depths' consistency, and variations in the pattern
motifs at different level sets. This paper leverages persistent homology from
Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to derive noise-robust scores for quantifying
motifs' depth and roundness in a pattern. Specifically, sublevel persistence is
used to derive scores that quantify the consistency of indentation depths at
any level set in Piezo Vibration Striking Treatment (PVST) surfaces. Moreover,
we combine sublevel persistence with the distance transform to quantify the
consistency of the indentation radii, and to compare them with the nominal
ones. Although the tool in our PVST experiments had a semi-spherical profile,
we present a generalization of our approach to tools/motifs of arbitrary shapes
thus making our method applicable to other pattern-generating manufacturing
processes.

we require (i) high generation quality, (ii) flexibility for manipulation and
applications such as conditional synthesis and shape interpolation, and (iii)
the ability to output smooth surfaces or meshes. To this end, we introduce the
hierarchical Latent Point Diffusion Model (LION) for 3D shape generation. LION
is set up as a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a hierarchical latent space
that combines a global shape latent representation with a point-structured
latent space. For generation, we train two hierarchical DDMs in these latent
spaces. The hierarchical VAE approach boosts performance compared to DDMs that
operate on point clouds directly, while the point-structured latents are still
ideally suited for DDM-based modeling. Experimentally, LION achieves
state-of-the-art generation performance on multiple ShapeNet benchmarks.
Furthermore, our VAE framework allows us to easily use LION for different
relevant tasks: LION excels at multimodal shape denoising and voxel-conditioned
synthesis, and it can be adapted for text- and image-driven 3D generation. We
also demonstrate shape autoencoding and latent shape interpolation, and we
augment LION with modern surface reconstruction techniques to generate smooth

multiple existing object detectors to build Quasi-Dense Tracking (QDTrack),
which does not require displacement regression or motion priors. We find that

effective instance similarity even from static input, enabling a competitive

We conduct extensive experiments on a wide variety of popular MOT benchmarks.

  Code-Switched Egyptian Arabic-English Text","Accepted to EACL 2023",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Data sparsity is one of the main challenges posed by code-switching (CS),
which is further exacerbated in the case of morphologically rich languages. For
the task of machine translation (MT), morphological segmentation has proven
successful in alleviating data sparsity in monolingual contexts; however, it
has not been investigated for CS settings. In this paper, we study the
effectiveness of different segmentation approaches on MT performance, covering
morphology-based and frequency-based segmentation techniques. We experiment on
MT from code-switched Arabic-English to English. We provide detailed analysis,
examining a variety of conditions, such as data size and sentences with
different degrees of CS. Empirical results show that morphology-aware
segmenters perform the best in segmentation tasks but under-perform in MT.
Nevertheless, we find that the choice of the segmentation setup to use for MT
is highly dependent on the data size. For extreme low-resource scenarios, a
combination of frequency and morphology-based segmentations is shown to perform
the best. For more resourced settings, such a combination does not bring
significant improvements over the use of frequency-based segmentation.

2017cbv, two Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) on the outskirts of the same host
galaxy, NGC 5643. This work utilizes new nebular-phase near-infrared (NIR)
spectra obtained by the Carnegie Supernova Project-II, in addition to
previously published optical and NIR spectra. By measuring nebular-phase [Fe
II] lines in both the optical and NIR, we examine the explosion kinematics and
test the efficacy of several emission line fitting techniques commonly used in
the literature. The NIR [Fe II] 1.644 $\mu$m line provides the most robust
velocity measurements against variations due to the choice of the fit method
and line blending. The resulting effects on velocity measurements due to
choosing different fit methods, initial fit parameters, continuum and line
profile functions, and fit region boundaries were also investigated. The NIR
[Fe II] velocities yield the same radial shift direction as velocities measured
using the optical [Fe II] 7155 A line, but the sizes of the shifts are
consistently and substantially lower, pointing to a potential issue in optical
studies. The NIR [Fe II] 1.644 $\mu$m emission profile shows a lack of
significant asymmetry in both SNe Ia, and the observed low velocities elevate
the importance for correcting for any radial velocity contribution from the
host galaxy's rotation. The low [Fe II] velocities measured in the NIR at
nebular phases disfavors most progenitor scenarios in close double-degenerate
systems for both SN 2013aa and SN 2017cbv. The time evolution of the NIR [Fe
II] 1.644 $\mu$m line also indicates moderately high progenitor white dwarf
central density and potentially high magnetic fields. These sibling SNe Ia were
well observed at both early and late times, providing an excellent opportunity
to study the intrinsic diversity of SNe Ia.

classification of two-dimensional CFTs, where the modular forms in the

study of the differential equations and their solutions for the Hecke groups
$\Gamma_{0}(N)$ and Fricke groups $\Gamma_{0}^{+}(N)$ would better our
understanding of CFT classification as there has not been significant work on
the MLDE analysis for subgroups of $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. In this paper, we
set up and solve MLDEs for Hecke and Fricke groups at levels $N\leq 12$ and
report on admissible character-like solutions obtained in each group. We find
that only the first four genus zero groups $\Gamma_{0}^{+}(p)$ where $p$ is a
prime divisor of the Monster group $\mathbb{M}$ possess admissible single
character solutions and we argue that the solutions for $\Gamma_{0}^{+}(11)$
are rendered inadmissible due to its Hauptmodul while those for
$\Gamma_{0}^{+}(13)$ are rendered inadmissible due to the nature of the basis
decomposition of the space of modular forms. We present a new quasi-character
solution at the single character level for the Hecke groups $\Gamma_{0}(2)$,
$\Gamma_{0}(7)$, and the subsequent group in its modular tower,
$\Gamma_{0}(49)$. We also extend all of the results for single character
solutions of Fricke groups to all prime divisor levels of $\mathbb{M}$ and
remark on favorable properties in each group that could play a role in
obtaining admissible solutions. Finally, we find the $\Theta$-series associated
with levels $p = 2,3,5,7$ and the corresponding lattice data of Kissing numbers
and lattice radii for each case. We find that the Fricke $\Theta$-series of
level $p = 2$ has distinctive ties to the odd Leech lattice in $24$-dimensions.

conservation. The problem of acquiring data of an underlying environment that
usually changes within time involves a proper formulation of the information.
The use of Autonomous Surface Vehicles equipped with water quality sensor
modules can serve as an early-warning system agents for contamination
peak-detection, algae blooms monitoring, or oil-spill scenarios. In addition to
information gathering, the vehicle must plan routes that are free of obstacles
on non-convex maps. This work proposes a framework to obtain a collision-free
policy that addresses the patrolling task for static and dynamic scenarios.
Using information gain as a measure of the uncertainty reduction over data, it
is proposed a Deep Q-Learning algorithm improved by a Q-Censoring mechanism for
model-based obstacle avoidance. The obtained results demonstrate the usefulness
of the proposed algorithm for water resource monitoring for static and dynamic
scenarios. Simulations showed the use of noise-networks are a good choice for
enhanced exploration, with 3 times less redundancy in the paths. Previous
coverage strategies are also outperformed both in the accuracy of the obtained
contamination model by a 13% on average and by a 37% in the detection of
dangerous contamination peaks. Finally, these results indicate the
appropriateness of the proposed framework for monitoring scenarios with

visualization of fluid motion, capable of reconstructing three-dimensional
trajectories of small tracer particles suspended in nearly any medium,
including fluids that are opaque or contained within opaque vessels. The
particles are labeled radioactively, and their positions are reconstructed from
the detection of pairs of back-to-back photons emitted by positron
annihilation. Current reconstruction algorithms are heuristic and typically
based on minimizing the distance between the particles and the so-called lines
of response (LoRs) joining the detection points, while accounting for spurious
LoRs generated by scattering. Here we develop a probabilistic framework for the
Bayesian inference and uncertainty quantification of particle positions from
PEPT data. We formulate a likelihood by describing the emission of photons and
their noisy detection as a Poisson process in the space of LoRs. We derive
formulas for the corresponding Poisson rate in the case of cylindrical
detectors, accounting for both undetected and scattered photons. We illustrate
the formulation by quantifying the uncertainty in the reconstruction of the
position of a single particle on a circular path from data generated by
state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations. The results show how the observation
time $\Delta t$ can be chosen optimally to balance the need for a large number
of LoRs with the requirement of small particle displacement imposed by the
assumption that the particle is static over $\Delta t$. We further show how
this assumption can be relaxed by inferring jointly the position and velocity
of the particle, with clear benefits for the accuracy of the reconstruction.

This general counting method can be applied to counting muons in existing

We therefore use the latter as a study case to test the performance of our
method and to compare it to other methods from literature. Our method proves to
perform with little bias, and also provides an estimate of the number of
particles as a function of time (as seen by the detector) to a single time-bin
resolution. In this context, the new method can be useful for reconstructing
parameters sensitive to cosmic ray mass, which are key to unveiling the origin
of cosmic rays.

way to address this would be to approach narrative design in a more abstract
layer, such as narrative structures. This paper presents Story Designer, a
mixed-initiative co-creative narrative structure tool built on top of the
Evolutionary Dungeon Designer (EDD) that uses tropes, narrative conventions
found across many media types, to design these structures. Story Designer uses
tropes as building blocks for narrative designers to compose complete narrative
structures by interconnecting them in graph structures called narrative graphs.
Our mixed-initiative approach lets designers manually create their narrative
graphs and feeds an underlying evolutionary algorithm with those, creating
quality-diverse suggestions using MAP-Elites. Suggestions are visually
represented for designers to compare and evaluate and can then be incorporated
into the design for further manual editions. At the same time, we use the
levels designed within EDD as constraints for the narrative structure,
intertwining both level design and narrative. We evaluate the impact of these
constraints and the system's adaptability and expressiveness, resulting in a
potential tool to create narrative structures combining level design aspects
with narrative.

Participants were assessed with 12 WM tasks, systematically varying the

activities to be performed at once: retention alone, ignoring distractors, and
dealing with dual tasks). We examined younger children, n = 501, Mage = 56.8

A Bayesian analytical approach was adopted. Our results suggested that a
four-factor model distinguishing between verbal, visual, spatial-simultaneous,

structure was very similar in the two groups. We further explored this result
with an additional model with a central executive factor loaded on high-control

only modest, however. Our findings demonstrate that it is important to
distinguish between WM components in young children.

standard 5m x 3m x 5m classroom is considered where 24 students are seated,
accompanied by a teacher. A computational fluid dynamics simulation based on
OpenFOAM is performed using a Eulerian-Lagrangian framework. Based on the
stochastic dose response framework, we have evaluated the infection risk in the
classroom for two distinct cases: (i) certain students are infected (ii) the
teacher is infected. If the teacher is infected, the probability of infection
could reach 100% for certain students. When certain students are infected, the
maximum infection risk for a susceptible person reaches 30%. The commonly used
cloth mask proves to be ineffective in providing protection against infection
transmission reducing the maximum infection probability by approximately 26%
only. Another commonly used solution in the form of shields installed on desks
have also failed to provide adequate protection against infection reducing the
infection risk only by 50%. Furthermore, the shields serves as a source of
fomite mode of infection. Screens suspended from the ceiling, which entrap
droplets, have been proposed as a novel solution that reduces the infection
risk by 90% and 95% compared to the no screen scenario besides being completely
devoid of fomite infection mode. As a result of the screens, the class-time can
be extended by 55 minutes.

records and economic information. However, most companies manipulate investors
and financial institutions by inflating their financial statements. Fraudulent
Financial Activities exist in any monetary or financial transaction scenario,
whether physical or electronic. A challenging problem that arises in this
domain is the issue that affects and troubles individuals and institutions.
This problem has attracted more attention in the field in part owing to the
prevalence of financial fraud and the paucity of previous research. For this
purpose, in this study, the main approach to solve this problem, an anomaly
detection-based approach based on a combination of feature selection based on
squirrel optimization pattern and classification methods have been used. The
aim is to develop this method to provide a model for detecting anomalies in
financial statements using a combination of selected features with the nearest
neighbor classifications, neural networks, support vector machine, and
Bayesian. Anomaly samples are then analyzed and compared to recommended
techniques using assessment criteria. Squirrel optimization's meta-exploratory
capability, along with the approach's ability to identify abnormalities in
financial data, has been shown to be effective in implementing the suggested
strategy. They discovered fake financial statements because of their expertise.

delicious dishes. Over centuries, cultures worldwide have evolved diverse
cooking practices ingrained in their culinary traditions. Recipes, thus, are
cultural capsules that capture culinary knowledge in elaborate cooking
protocols. While simple quantitative models have probed the patterns in recipe
composition and the process of cuisine evolution, unlike other cultural quirks
such as language, the principles of cooking remain hitherto unexplored. The
fundamental rules that drive the act of cooking, shaping recipe composition and
cuisine architecture, are unclear. Here we present a generative grammar of
cooking that captures the underlying culinary logic. By studying an extensive
repository of structured recipes, we identify core concepts and rules that
together forge a combinatorial system for culinary synthesis. Building on the
body of work done in the context of language, the demonstration of a logically
consistent generative framework offers profound insights into the act of
cooking. Given the central role of food in nutrition and lifestyle disorders,
culinary grammar provides leverage to improve public health through dietary
interventions beyond applications for creative pursuits such as novel recipe
generation.
