first-order transition in disordered athermal systems. The study focuses on the
zero temperature random field Ising model (ZTRFIM) above the critical disorder
for spatial dimensions $d=2,3,$ and $4$. We use Monte Carlo simulations to show
that disorder suppresses critical slowing down in phase ordering time for
finite-dimensional systems. The dynamic hysteresis scaling, the measure of
explicit finite-time scaling, is used to subsequently quantify the critical
slowing down. The scaling exponents in all dimensions increase with disorder
strength and finally reach a stable value where the transformation is no longer
critical. The associated critical behavior in the mean-field limit is very
different, where the exponent values for various disorders in all dimensions
are similar. The non-mean-field exponents asymptotically approach the
mean-field value ($\Upsilon \approx 2/3$) with increase in dimensions. The
results suggest that the critical features in the hysteretic metastable phase
are controlled by inherent mean-field spinodal instability that gets blurred by
disorder in low-dimension athermal systems.

quasars are radio-loud objects with extended radio lobes that indicate their
orientation close to the sky plane. Five of the eight QSOs are classified as
giant radio quasars. All quasars showed variability during our monitoring, with
magnitude variations between 0.3 and 1 mag for the least variable and the most
variable QSO, respectively. We performed both structure function (SF) analysis
and power spectrum density (PSD) analysis for the variability characterization
and search for characteristic timescales and periodicities. As a result of our
analysis, we obtained relatively steep SF slopes ($\alpha$ ranging from 0.49 to
0.75) that are consistent with the derived PSD slopes ($\sim$2--3). All the
PSDs show a good fit to single power law forms, indicating a red-noise
character of variability between $\sim$13 years and weeks timescales. We did
not measure reliable characteristic timescales of variability from the SF
analysis which indicates that the duration of the gathered data is too short to
reveal them. The absence of bends in the PSDs (change of slope from $\geq$1 to
$\sim$0) on longer timescales indicates that optical variations are most likely
caused by thermal instabilities in the accretion disk.

in which applicants for a finite set of positions must be interviewed or made
offers to. There is a finite time budget for interviewing or making offers, and
a stochastic realization after each decision, leading to
computationally-challenging problems. In the first problem, we study sequential
interviewing and show that a computationally-tractable, non-adaptive policy
that must make offers immediately after interviewing is approximately optimal,
assuming offerees always accept their offers. In the second problem, we assume
that applicants have already been interviewed but only accept offers with some
probability; we develop a computationally-tractable policy that makes offers
for the different positions in parallel, which can be used even if positions
are heterogeneous and is approximately optimal relative to a policy that can
make the same amount of offers not in parallel. In the third problem, we
introduce a model where the hiring firm is tightly time constrained and must
send all offers simultaneously in a single time step, with the possibility of
hiring over capacity at a cost; we provide nearly-tight bounds for the
performance of practically motivated value-ordered policies.
  All in all, our paper takes a unified approach to three different hiring

generalize and improve the guarantees from Purohit et al. (2019) that were
between 1/8 and 1/2 to new guarantees that are at least 1-1/e. We also
numerically compare three different settings of making offers to candidates

complete denial of service (DoS) to wireless communication protocols. Moreover,
jamming devices are getting smarter, making them difficult to detect. Forward
error correction, which adds redundancy to data, is commonly deployed to
protect communications against the deleterious effects of channel noise.
Soft-information error correction decoders obtain reliability information from
the receiver to inform their decoding, but in the presence of a jammer such
information is misleading and results in degraded error correction performance.
As decoders assume noise occurs independently to each bit, a bursty jammer will
lead to greater degradation in performance than a non-bursty one. Here we
establish, however, that such temporal dependencies can aid inferences on which
bits have been subjected to jamming, thus enabling counter-measures. In
particular, we introduce a pre-decoding processing step that updates
log-likelihood ratio (LLR) reliability information to reflect inferences in the
presence of a jammer, enabling improved decoding performance for any soft
detection decoder. The proposed method requires no alteration to the decoding
algorithm. Simulation results show that the method correctly infers a
significant proportion of jamming in any received frame. Results with one
particular decoding algorithm, the recently introduced ORBGRAND, show that the
proposed method reduces the block-error rate (BLER) by an order of magnitude
for a selection of codes, and prevents complete DoS at the receiver.

The most important factor in speed is the number of cache lines accessed during
updates and queries. This is especially important on PMEM, which is slower than
DRAM and in which writes are more expensive than reads.
  This paper proposes two stronger design objectives: stability and
low-associativity. A stable hash table doesn't move items around, and a hash
table has low associativity if there are only a few locations where an item can
be stored. Low associativity ensures that queries need to examine only a few
memory locations, and stability ensures that insertions write to very few cache
lines. Stability also simplifies scaling and crash safety.
  We present IcebergHT, a fast, crash-safe, concurrent, and space-efficient
hash table for PMEM based on the design principles of stability and low
associativity. IcebergHT combines in-memory metadata with a new hashing
technique, iceberg hashing, that is (1) space efficient, (2) stable, and (3)
supports low associativity. In contrast, existing hash-tables either modify
numerous cache lines during insertions (e.g. cuckoo hashing), access numerous
cache lines during queries (e.g. linear probing), or waste space (e.g.
chaining). Moreover, the combination of (1)-(3) yields several emergent
benefits: IcebergHT scales better than other hash tables, supports
crash-safety, and has excellent performance on PMEM (where writes are
particularly expensive).

adversarial attacks that perturb original samples to fool classifiers such as
an autonomous vehicle's road sign image classifier. CNNs also lack invariance
in the classification of symmetric samples because CNNs can classify symmetric
samples differently. Considered together, the CNN lack of adversarial
robustness and the CNN lack of invariance mean that the classification of
symmetric adversarial samples can differ from their incorrect classification.
Could symmetric adversarial samples revert to their correct classification?
This paper answers this question by designing a symmetry defense that inverts
or horizontally flips adversarial samples before classification against
adversaries unaware of the defense. Against adversaries aware of the defense,
the defense devises a Klein four symmetry subgroup that includes the horizontal
flip and pixel inversion symmetries. The symmetry defense uses the subgroup
symmetries in accuracy evaluation and the subgroup closure property to confine
the transformations that an adaptive adversary can apply before or after
generating the adversarial sample. Without changing the preprocessing,
parameters, or model, the proposed symmetry defense counters the Projected
Gradient Descent (PGD) and AutoAttack attacks with near-default accuracies for
ImageNet. Without using attack knowledge or adversarial samples, the proposed
defense exceeds the current best defense, which trains on adversarial samples.
The defense maintains and even improves the classification accuracy of

optimal sensor placement against an adversary in uncertain networked control

a malicious adversary and a detector. Given a protected performance vertex, we
consider a detector, with uncertain system knowledge, that selects another
vertex on which to place a sensor and monitors its output with the aim of
detecting the presence of the adversary. On the other hand, the adversary, also
with uncertain system knowledge, chooses a single vertex and conducts a
cyber-attack on its input. The purpose of the adversary is to drive the attack
vertex as to maximally disrupt the protected performance vertex while remaining
undetected by the detector. As our first contribution, the game payoff of the
above-defined zero-sum game is formulated in terms of the Value-at-Risk of the
adversary's impact. However, this game payoff corresponds to an intractable
optimization problem. To tackle the problem, we adopt the scenario approach to
approximately compute the game payoff. Then, the optimal monitor selection is
determined by analyzing the equilibrium of the zero-sum game. The proposed
approach is illustrated via a numerical example of a 10-vertex networked

of large-scale deep learning models, i.e., promoting their weight sparsity. As
illustrated by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH), pruning also has the
potential of improving their generalization ability. At the core of LTH,
iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) is the predominant pruning method to
successfully find 'winning tickets'. Yet, the computation cost of IMP grows
prohibitively as the targeted pruning ratio increases. To reduce the
computation overhead, various efficient 'one-shot' pruning methods have been
developed, but these schemes are usually unable to find winning tickets as good
as IMP. This raises the question of how to close the gap between pruning
accuracy and pruning efficiency? To tackle it, we pursue the algorithmic
advancement of model pruning. Specifically, we formulate the pruning problem
from a fresh and novel viewpoint, bi-level optimization (BLO). We show that the
BLO interpretation provides a technically-grounded optimization base for an
efficient implementation of the pruning-retraining learning paradigm used in
IMP. We also show that the proposed bi-level optimization-oriented pruning
method (termed BiP) is a special class of BLO problems with a bi-linear problem
structure. By leveraging such bi-linearity, we theoretically show that BiP can
be solved as easily as first-order optimization, thus inheriting the
computation efficiency. Through extensive experiments on both structured and
unstructured pruning with 5 model architectures and 4 data sets, we demonstrate
that BiP can find better winning tickets than IMP in most cases, and is
computationally as efficient as the one-shot pruning schemes, demonstrating 2-7
times speedup over IMP for the same level of model accuracy and sparsity.

large-scale and long-term GPS tracking datasets involving more than 600
individuals. Our experiments show that the proposed method significantly
outperforms other state-of-the-art next location prediction methods by a large
margin (8.05% and 5.60% relative increase in F1-score for the two datasets,
respectively). We conduct an extensive ablation study that quantifies the
influence of considering temporal features, travel mode information, and the
auxiliary task on the prediction results. Moreover, we experimentally determine
the performance upper bound when including the next mode prediction in our
model. Finally, our analysis indicates that the performance of location
prediction varies significantly with the chosen next travel mode by the
individual. These results show potential for a more systematic consideration of

exploration-exploitation trade-off in the vast design space of biological
sequences. Whereas it is possible to optimize the various properties of
interest jointly using a multi-objective acquisition function, such as the
expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI), this approach does not account for
objectives with a hierarchical dependency structure. We consider a common use
case where some regions of the Pareto frontier are prioritized over others
according to a specified $\textit{partial ordering}$ in the objectives. For
instance, when designing antibodies, we would like to maximize the binding
affinity to a target antigen only if it can be expressed in live cell culture
-- modeling the experimental dependency in which affinity can only be measured
for antibodies that can be expressed and thus produced in viable quantities. In
general, we may want to confer a partial ordering to the properties such that
each property is optimized conditioned on its parent properties satisfying some
feasibility condition. To this end, we present PropertyDAG, a framework that
operates on top of the traditional multi-objective BO to impose this desired
ordering on the objectives, e.g. expression $\rightarrow$ affinity. We
demonstrate its performance over multiple simulated active learning iterations
on a penicillin production task, toy numerical problem, and a real-world
antibody design task.

catastrophic population collapse in a class of predator-prey models with two
species of predators competing for their common prey, where the prey evolves on
a faster timescale than the predators. In a parameter regime near {\em{singular
Hopf bifurcation}} of a coexistence equilibrium point, we assume that the class
of models exhibits bistability between a periodic attractor and a boundary
equilibrium point, where the invariant manifolds of the coexistence equilibrium
play central roles in organizing the dynamics. To determine whether a solution
that starts in a vicinity of the coexistence equilibrium approaches the
periodic attractor or the point attractor, we reduce the equations to a
suitable normal form, which is valid near the singular Hopf bifurcation, and
study its geometric structure. A key component of our study includes an
analysis of the transient dynamics, characterized by their rapid oscillations
with a slow variation in amplitude, by applying a moving average technique. As
a result of our analysis, we could devise a method for identifying early
warning signals, significantly in advance, of a future crisis that could lead
to extinction of one of the predators. The analysis is applied to the
predator-prey model considered in [\emph{Discrete and Continuous Dynamical

been significantly enhanced by the development of on-line social networks.
Several theoretical and computational studies have been devoted to
understanding the dynamics and to control rumor spreading. In the present work,
a model of rumor-telling in opinion polarized networks was investigated through
extensive computer simulations. The key mechanism is the coupling between ones'
opinions and their leaning to spread a given information, either by supporting
or opposing its content. We report that a highly modular topology of polarized
networks strongly impairs rumor spreading, but the couplings between agent's
opinions and their spreading/stifling rates can either further inhibit or,
conversely, foster information propagation, depending on the nature of those
couplings. In particular, a controversy-seeking mechanism, in which agents are
stimulated to postpone their transitions to the stiffer state upon interactions
with other agents of confronting opinions, enhances the rumor spreading.
Therefore such a mechanism is capable of overcoming the propagation bottlenecks
imposed by loosely connected modular structures.

efforts have been focusing on infusing commonsense and domain-specific
knowledge to prepare LMs for downstream tasks. These works attempt to leverage
knowledge graphs, the de facto standard of symbolic knowledge representation,
along with pretrained LMs. While existing approaches have leveraged external
knowledge, it remains an open question how to jointly incorporate knowledge
graphs representing varying contexts, from local (e.g., sentence), to
document-level, to global knowledge, to enable knowledge-rich exchange across
these contexts. Such rich contextualization can be especially beneficial for
long document understanding tasks since standard pretrained LMs are typically
bounded by the input sequence length. In light of these challenges, we propose
KALM, a Knowledge-Aware Language Model that jointly leverages knowledge in
local, document-level, and global contexts for long document understanding.
KALM first encodes long documents and knowledge graphs into the three
knowledge-aware context representations. It then processes each context with
context-specific layers, followed by a context fusion layer that facilitates
knowledge exchange to derive an overarching document representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that KALM achieves state-of-the-art performance on six
long document understanding tasks and datasets. Further analyses reveal that
the three knowledge-aware contexts are complementary and they all contribute to
model performance, while the importance and information exchange patterns of
different contexts vary with respect to different tasks and datasets.

mammographic screening and increased risk of developing breast cancer. Accurate
and reliable automated density estimates can be used for direct risk prediction
and passing density related information to further predictive models. Expert
reader assessments of density show a strong relationship to cancer risk but
also inter-reader variation. The effect of label variability on model
performance is important when considering how to utilise automated methods for
both research and clinical purposes. Methods: We utilise subsets of images with
density labels to train a deep transfer learning model which is used to assess
how label variability affects the mapping from representation to prediction. We
then create two end-to-end deep learning models which allow us to investigate
the effect of label variability on the model representation formed. Results: We
show that the trained mappings from representations to labels are altered
considerably by the variability of reader scores. Training on labels with
distribution variation removed causes the Spearman rank correlation
coefficients to rise from $0.751\pm0.002$ to either $0.815\pm0.006$ when
averaging across readers or $0.844\pm0.002$ when averaging across images.
However, when we train different models to investigate the representation
effect we see little difference, with Spearman rank correlation coefficients of
$0.846\pm0.006$ and $0.850\pm0.006$ showing no statistically significant
difference in the quality of the model representation with regard to density
prediction. Conclusions: We show that the mapping between representation and
mammographic density prediction is significantly affected by label variability.
However, the effect of the label variability on the model representation is

the multi-scale nature of reconnection hinders studies on heavy-ion

time, our simulations demonstrate nonthermal acceleration of all available ion
species into power-law spectra. The reconnection layers consist of fragmented
kinking flux ropes as part of the reconnection-driven turbulence, which
produces field-line chaos critical for accelerating all species. The upstream
ion velocities influence the first Fermi reflection for injection. Then lower
charge/mass species initiate Fermi acceleration at later times as they interact

The PB2-A is the first of three telescopes in the Simon Array (SA), which is an
array of three cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization sensitive
telescopes located at the POLARBEAR (PB) site in Northern Chile. As the
successor to the PB experiment, each telescope and receiver combination is
named as PB2-A, PB2-B, and PB2-C. PB2-A and -B will have nearly identical
receivers operating at 90 and 150 GHz while PB2-C will house a receiver
operating at 220 and 270 GHz. Each receiver contains a focal plane consisting
of seven close-hex packed lenslet coupled sinuous antenna transition edge
sensor bolometer arrays. Each array contains 271 di-chroic optical pixels each
of which have four TES bolometers for a total of 7588 detectors per receiver.
We have produced a set of two types of candidate arrays for PB2-A. The first we
call Version 11 (V11) and uses a silicon oxide (SiOx) for the transmission
lines and cross-over process for orthogonal polarizations. The second we call
Version 13 (V13) and uses silicon nitride (SiNx) for the transmission lines and
cross-under process for orthogonal polarizations. We have produced enough of
each type of array to fully populate the focal plane of the PB2-A receiver. The
average wirebond yield for V11 and V13 arrays is 93.2% and 95.6% respectively.
The V11 arrays had a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 452 +/- 15
mK, a normal resistance (Rn) of 1.25 +/- 0.20 Ohms, and saturations powers of
5.2 +/- 1.0 pW and 13 +/- 1.2 pW for the 90 and 150 GHz bands respectively. The
V13 arrays had a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 456 +/-6 mK, a
normal resistance (Rn) of 1.1 +/- 0.2 Ohms, and saturations powers of 10.8 +/-
1.8 pW and 22.9 +/- 2.6 pW for the 90 and 150 GHz bands respectively.

shown great power in solving high-dimensional forward-backward stochastic
differential equations (FBSDEs), and inspired many applications. However, the
method solves backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) in a forward
manner, which can not be used for optimal stopping problems that in general
require running BSDE backwardly. To overcome this difficulty, a recent paper
[Wang, Chen, Sudjianto, Liu and Shen, arXiv:1807.06622, 2018] proposed the
backward deep BSDE method to solve the optimal stopping problem. In this paper,
we provide the rigorous theory for the backward deep BSDE method. Specifically,
1. We derive the a posteriori error estimation, i.e., the error of the
numerical solution can be bounded by the training loss function; and; 2. We
give an upper bound of the loss function, which can be sufficiently small
subject to universal approximations. We give two numerical examples, which
present consistent performance with the proved theory.

from, cognitive models instead of humans, thereby making their training process
both less costly and faster. Here, we leverage this idea in the context of

fairness through interacting with a cognitive model of the Ultimatum Game (UG),
a canonical task in behavioral and brain sciences for studying fairness.
Interestingly, these RL agents learn to rationally adapt their behavior

inheritance of the divergence-free property of solutions, so that it can
intrinsically be employed to construct and estimate solutions of the
Navier-Stokes equations. New regularity estimates of strong solutions of the
three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are obtained by deriving new explicit
a priori estimates for the heat kernel (i.e., the fundamental solution) of the
corresponding heterogeneous drift-diffusion operator. These new a priori
estimates are derived by using various functional integral representations of
the heat kernel in terms of the associated diffusion processes and their
conditional laws, including a Bismut-type formula for the gradient of the heat
kernel. Then the a priori estimates of solutions of the linearized vorticity
equations are established by employing a Feynman-Kac-type formula. The
existence of strong solutions and their regularity estimates up to a time
proportional to the reciprocal of the square of the maximum initial vorticity
are established. All the estimates established in this paper contain known

with accurate bounding box annotations are expensive to collect and use for
supervision at scale. In this work, we propose VoLTA (Vision-Language
Transformer with weakly-supervised local-feature Alignment), a new VLP paradigm
that only utilizes image-caption data but achieves fine-grained region-level
image understanding, eliminating the use of expensive box annotations. VoLTA
adopts graph optimal transport-based weakly-supervised alignment on local image
patches and text tokens to germinate an explicit, self-normalized, and
interpretable low-level matching criterion. In addition, VoLTA pushes
multi-modal fusion deep into the uni-modal backbones during pre-training and
removes fusion-specific transformer layers, further reducing memory
requirements. Extensive experiments on a wide range of vision- and
vision-language downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of VoLTA on
fine-grained applications without compromising the coarse-grained downstream
performance, often outperforming methods using significantly more caption and
box annotations.

interface between two-dimensional (2D) materials with different topological
invariants. Therefore, 1D chiral interface channels (CICs) can be created at
the boundary of two quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators with different
Chern numbers. Such a QAH junction can function as a chiral edge current
distributer at zero magnetic field, but its realization remains challenging.
Here, by employing an in-situ mechanical mask, we use molecular beam epitaxy
(MBE) to synthesize QAH insulator junctions, in which two QAH insulators with
different Chern numbers are connected along a 1D junction. For the junction
between C = 1 and C = -1 QAH insulators, we observe quantized transport and
demonstrate the appearance of the two parallel propagating CICs along the
magnetic domain wall at zero magnetic field. Moreover, since the Chern number
of the QAH insulators in magnetic topological insulator (TI)/TI multilayers can
be tuned by altering magnetic TI/TI bilayer periods, the junction between two
QAH insulators with arbitrary Chern numbers can be achieved by growing
different periods of magnetic TI/TI on the two sides of the sample. For the
junction between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH insulators, our quantized transport shows
that a single CIC appears at the interface. Our work lays down the foundation
for the development of QAH insulator-based electronic and spintronic devices,
topological chiral networks, and topological quantum computations.

recent solution to this problem is calibrating the distribution of these few

examples, where how to decide the transfer weights from base classes to novel

novel samples and base classes, we can view the learned transport plan as the
adaptive weight information for transferring the statistics of base classes.
The learning of the cost function between a base class and novel class in the
high-level OT leads to the introduction of the low-level OT, which considers
the weights of all the data samples in the base class. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed plug-and-play model
outperforms competing approaches and owns desired cross-domain generalization
ability, indicating the effectiveness of the learned adaptive weights.

improvement without modifying any weights of CLIP, and it can further improve a

today's deep models. In this work, we aim to re-investigate the training
process of residual networks from a novel social psychology perspective of
loafing, and further propose a new training strategy to strengthen the
performance of residual networks. As residual networks can be viewed as
ensembles of relatively shallow networks (i.e., \textit{unraveled view}) in
prior works, we also start from such view and consider that the final
performance of a residual network is co-determined by a group of sub-networks.
Inspired by the social loafing problem of social psychology, we find that
residual networks invariably suffer from similar problem, where sub-networks in
a residual network are prone to exert less effort when working as part of the
group compared to working alone. We define this previously overlooked problem
as \textit{network loafing}. As social loafing will ultimately cause the low
individual productivity and the reduced overall performance, network loafing
will also hinder the performance of a given residual network and its
sub-networks. Referring to the solutions of social psychology, we propose
\textit{stimulative training}, which randomly samples a residual sub-network
and calculates the KL-divergence loss between the sampled sub-network and the
given residual network, to act as extra supervision for sub-networks and make
the overall goal consistent. Comprehensive empirical results and theoretical
analyses verify that stimulative training can well handle the loafing problem,
and improve the performance of a residual network by improving the performance
of its sub-networks. The code is available at

well on unseen test domains. Great efforts have been made to learn
domain-invariant features by aligning distributions across domains. However,
existing works are often designed based on some relaxed conditions which are
generally hard to satisfy and fail to realize the desired joint distribution
alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel domain generalization method,
which originates from an intuitive idea that a domain-invariant classifier can
be learned by minimizing the KL-divergence between posterior distributions from
different domains. To enhance the generalizability of the learned classifier,
we formalize the optimization objective as an expectation computed on the
ground-truth marginal distribution. Nevertheless, it also presents two obvious
deficiencies, one of which is the side-effect of entropy increase in
KL-divergence and the other is the unavailability of ground-truth marginal
distributions. For the former, we introduce a term named maximum in-domain
likelihood to maintain the discrimination of the learned domain-invariant
representation space. For the latter, we approximate the ground-truth marginal
distribution with source domains under a reasonable convex hull assumption.
Finally, a Constrained Maximum Cross-domain Likelihood (CMCL) optimization
problem is deduced, by solving which the joint distributions are naturally
aligned. An alternating optimization strategy is carefully designed to
approximately solve this optimization problem. Extensive experiments on four
standard benchmark datasets, i.e., Digits-DG, PACS, Office-Home and
miniDomainNet, highlight the superior performance of our method.

adequately covers the state space -- play a fundamental role in determining the
sample complexity of offline reinforcement learning. While such conditions
might seem irrelevant to online reinforcement learning at first glance, we
establish a new connection by showing -- somewhat surprisingly -- that the mere
existence of a data distribution with good coverage can enable sample-efficient
online RL. Concretely, we show that coverability -- that is, existence of a
data distribution that satisfies a ubiquitous coverage condition called
concentrability -- can be viewed as a structural property of the underlying
MDP, and can be exploited by standard algorithms for sample-efficient
exploration, even when the agent does not know said distribution. We complement
this result by proving that several weaker notions of coverage, despite being
sufficient for offline RL, are insufficient for online RL. We also show that
existing complexity measures for online RL, including Bellman rank and
Bellman-Eluder dimension, fail to optimally capture coverability, and propose a
new complexity measure, the sequential extrapolation coefficient, to provide a
unification.

In recent
years, the techniques of video quality assessment (VQA) based on deep

existing works attempt to introduce the knowledge of the human visual system
(HVS) into VQA, there still exhibit limitations that prevent the full
exploitation of HVS, including an incomplete model by few characteristics and
insufficient connections among these characteristics. To overcome these
limitations, this paper revisits HVS with five representative characteristics,
and further reorganizes their connections. Based on the revisited HVS, a
no-reference VQA framework called HVS-5M (NRVQA framework with five modules
simulating HVS with five characteristics) is proposed. It works in a
domain-fusion design paradigm with advanced network structures. On the side of
the spatial domain, the visual saliency module applies SAMNet to obtain a
saliency map. And then, the content-dependency and the edge masking modules
respectively utilize ConvNeXt to extract the spatial features, which have been
attentively weighted by the saliency map for the purpose of highlighting those
regions that human beings may be interested in. On the other side of the
temporal domain, to supplement the static spatial features, the motion
perception module utilizes SlowFast to obtain the dynamic temporal features.
Besides, the temporal hysteresis module applies TempHyst to simulate the memory
mechanism of human beings, and comprehensively evaluates the quality score
according to the fusion features from the spatial and temporal domains.
Extensive experiments show that our HVS-5M outperforms the state-of-the-art VQA
methods. Ablation studies are further conducted to verify the effectiveness of
each module towards the proposed framework.

possibility of the planet being tidally locked due to spin-orbit

its orbital decay process, and we further identify that TOI-1807b is in a

currents flowing through the bulk when the system is driven by two reservoirs

suppression of transport due to the edge states, which couple to the reservoirs

recalibrated for new distributions. However, in practice, labeled data from new

we consider the problem of predicting the cutoff threshold for a new

developing the methods that can work in inter-subject classification scenario

of the transformer to the classification of SSVEP. Inspired by previous
studies, the model adopts the frequency spectrum of SSVEP data as input, and
explores the spectral and spatial domain information for classification.
Furthermore, to fully utilize the harmonic information, an extended SSVEPformer
based on the filter bank technology (FB-SSVEPformer) is proposed to further
improve the classification performance. Experiments were conducted using two
open datasets (Dataset 1: 10 subjects, 12-class task; Dataset 2: 35 subjects,
40-class task) in the inter-subject classification scenario. The experimental
results show that the proposed models could achieve better results in terms of

the electromagnetic spectrum of the accretion disk increases. Therefore, disks

them assume a static setting where both labeled and unlabeled data are given at
once for finding new categories. In this work, we focus on the application
scenarios where unlabeled data are continuously fed into the category discovery
system. We refer to it as the {\bf Continuous Category Discovery} ({\bf CCD})
problem, which is significantly more challenging than the static setting. A
common challenge faced by novel category discovery is that different sets of
features are needed for classification and category discovery: class
discriminative features are preferred for classification, while rich and
diverse features are more suitable for new category mining. This challenge
becomes more severe for dynamic setting as the system is asked to deliver good
performance for known classes over time, and at the same time continuously
discover new classes from unlabeled data. To address this challenge, we develop
a framework of {\bf Grow and Merge} ({\bf GM}) that works by alternating
between a growing phase and a merging phase: in the growing phase, it increases
the diversity of features through a continuous self-supervised learning for
effective category mining, and in the merging phase, it merges the grown model
with a static one to ensure satisfying performance for known classes. Our
extensive studies verify that the proposed GM framework is significantly more
effective than the state-of-the-art approaches for continuous category
discovery.

such as autonomous vehicles. However, they are fragile and are often
ill-behaved. Consequently, their behaviors should undergo rigorous guarantees
before deployment in practice. In this paper we propose a set-boundary
reachability method to investigate the safety verification problem of NNs from
a topological perspective. Given an NN with an input set and a safe set, the
safety verification problem is to determine whether all outputs of the NN
resulting from the input set fall within the safe set. In our method, the
homeomorphism property of NNs is mainly exploited, which establishes a
relationship mapping boundaries to boundaries. The exploitation of this
property facilitates reachability computations via extracting subsets of the
input set rather than the entire input set, thus controlling the wrapping
effect in reachability analysis and facilitating the reduction of computation
burdens for safety verification. The homeomorphism property exists in some
widely used NNs such as invertible NNs. Notable representations are invertible
residual networks (i-ResNets) and Neural ordinary differential equations
(Neural ODEs). For these NNs, our set-boundary reachability method only needs
to perform reachability analysis on the boundary of the input set. For NNs
which do not feature this property with respect to the input set, we explore
subsets of the input set for establishing the local homeomorphism property, and
then abandon these subsets for reachability computations. Finally, some
examples demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

a large amount of labeled data for training. However, it is difficult to
generalize the trained models to unseen sites due to different load
characteristics and operating patterns of appliances between data sets. For
addressing such problems, self-supervised learning (SSL) is proposed in this
paper, where labeled appliance-level data from the target data set or house is
not required. Initially, only the aggregate power readings from target data set
are required to pre-train a general network via a self-supervised pretext task
to map aggregate power sequences to derived representatives. Then, supervised
downstream tasks are carried out for each appliance category to fine-tune the
pre-trained network, where the features learned in the pretext task are
transferred. Utilizing labeled source data sets enables the downstream tasks to
learn how each load is disaggregated, by mapping the aggregate to labels.
Finally, the fine-tuned network is applied to load disaggregation for the
target sites. For validation, multiple experimental cases are designed based on
three publicly accessible REDD, UK-DALE, and REFIT data sets. Besides,
state-of-the-art neural networks are employed to perform NILM task in the
experiments. Based on the NILM results in various cases, SSL generally
outperforms zero-shot learning in improving load disaggregation performance

capability of the feature embedding network model since the embedding network
learned on training classes need to be evaluated on new test classes. To
address this challenge, in this paper, we introduce a new method called coded
residual transform (CRT) for deep metric learning to significantly improve its
generalization capability. Specifically, we learn a set of diversified
prototype features, project the feature map onto each prototype, and then
encode its features using their projection residuals weighted by their
correlation coefficients with each prototype. The proposed CRT method has the
following two unique characteristics. First, it represents and encodes the
feature map from a set of complimentary perspectives based on projections onto
diversified prototypes. Second, unlike existing transformer-based feature
representation approaches which encode the original values of features based on
global correlation analysis, the proposed coded residual transform encodes the
relative differences between the original features and their projected
prototypes. Embedding space density and spectral decay analysis show that this
multi-perspective projection onto diversified prototypes and coded residual
representation are able to achieve significantly improved generalization
capability in metric learning. Finally, to further enhance the generalization
performance, we propose to enforce the consistency on their feature similarity
matrices between coded residual transforms with different sizes of projection
prototypes and embedding dimensions. Our extensive experimental results and
ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed CRT method outperform the
state-of-the-art deep metric learning methods by large margins and improving
upon the current best method by up to 4.28% on the CUB dataset.

simultaneous measurement of particle image velocimetry (PIV) and CH*

(Re) or decreasing the equivalence ratio ({\Phi}) would facilitate the
emergence of CRZ. Further analysis demonstrates that the CRZ characteristics
and its emergence are strongly influenced by the inner shear layer (ISL)
surrounding the CRZ, while the swirl intensity remains unchanged. Dimensional
analysis is performed to understand the underlying mechanism, suggesting the
CRZ emergence is controlled by a non-dimensional parameter, Re_s=|{\gamma}|_max
D/{\nu}_s, defined based on the maximum ISL intensity (|{\gamma}|_max), the
exit diameter (D), and the kinematic viscosity ({\nu}_s) of the burnt gas. By
estimating the temperature and viscosity with a simple heat-loss model, we show
in the |{\gamma}|_max D-{\nu}_s regime diagram that the cases with and without
CRZ are separated by a single boundary line, corresponding to a critical Re_s
of about 424. This verifies the applicability of the proposed Re_s criterion to
lean-premixed V-shaped swirling flames under various conditions. Unlike most
previous works that attribute the CRZ of swirling flames to vortex breakdown,
the present work reveals the non-negligible effect of the ISL, especially the
CRZ suppression when the ISL is weakened by flame heating.

Our method performs joint masking on image-text input and integrates both
implicit and explicit targets for the masked signals to recover. The implicit
target provides a unified and debiased objective for vision and language, where
the model predicts latent multimodal representations of the unmasked input. The
explicit target further enriches the multimodal representations by recovering
high-level and semantically meaningful information: momentum visual features of
image patches and concepts of word tokens. Through such a masked modeling
process, our model not only learns fine-grained multimodal interaction, but
also avoids the semantic gap between high-level representations and low- or
mid-level prediction targets (e.g. image pixels), thus producing semantically
rich multimodal representations that perform well on both zero-shot and
fine-tuned settings. Our pre-trained model (named MAMO) achieves

This comes up in remote sensing applications such as pansharpening~(MS+PAN),
hyperspectral sharpening~(HS+PAN), and HS-MS fusion~(HS+MS). Remote sensing
images are textured and have repetitive structures. Motivated by nonlocal
patch-based methods for image restoration, we propose a convex regularizer that
(i) takes into account long-distance correlations, (ii) penalizes patch
variation, which is more effective than pixel variation for capturing texture
information, and (iii) uses the higher spatial resolution image as a guide
image for weight computation. We come up with an efficient ADMM algorithm for
optimizing the regularizer along with a standard least-squares loss function
derived from the imaging model. The novelty of our algorithm is that by
expressing patch variation as filtering operations and by judiciously splitting
the original variables and introducing latent variables, we are able to solve
the ADMM subproblems efficiently using FFT-based convolution and
soft-thresholding. As far as the reconstruction quality is concerned, our
method is shown to outperform state-of-the-art variational and deep learning

Semidefinite relaxation within the causal space. We compare the performance of

downscales high-resolution images to fit various display screens or to be
storage- and bandwidth-friendly, and afterward upscales the corresponding
low-resolution images to recover the original resolution or the details in the
zoom-in images. However, the non-injective downscaling mapping discards
high-frequency contents, leading to the ill-posed problem for the inverse
restoration task. This can be abstracted as a general image
degradation-restoration problem with information loss. In this work, we propose
a novel invertible framework to handle this general problem, which models the
bidirectional degradation and restoration from a new perspective, i.e.
invertible bijective transformation. The invertibility enables the framework to
model the information loss of pre-degradation in the form of distribution,
which could mitigate the ill-posed problem during post-restoration. To be
specific, we develop invertible models to generate valid degraded images and
meanwhile transform the distribution of lost contents to the fixed distribution
of a latent variable during the forward degradation. Then restoration is made
tractable by applying the inverse transformation on the generated degraded
image together with a randomly-drawn latent variable. We start from image
rescaling and instantiate the model as Invertible Rescaling Network (IRN),
which can be easily extended to the similar decolorization-colorization task.
We further propose to combine the invertible framework with existing
degradation methods such as image compression for wider applications.
Experimental results demonstrate the significant improvement of our model over
existing methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of
upscaling and colorizing reconstruction from downscaled and decolorized images,

close enough together to feel significant attraction, or repulsion, from the
strong, short-distance part of the nucleon-nucleon interaction. These strong
interactions lead to hard collisions between nucleons, generating pairs of
highly-energetic nucleons referred to as short-range correlations (SRCs). SRCs
are an important but relatively poorly understood part of nuclear structure and
mapping out the strength and isospin structure (neutron-proton vs proton-proton
pairs) of these virtual excitations is thus critical input for modeling a range
of nuclear, particle, and astrophysics measurements. Hitherto measurements used
two-nucleon knockout or ``triple-coincidence'' reactions to measure the
relative contribution of np- and pp-SRCs by knocking out a proton from the SRC
and detecting its partner nucleon (proton or neutron). These measurementsshow
that SRCs are almost exclusively np pairs, but had limited statistics and
required large model-dependent final-state interaction (FSI) corrections. We
report on the first measurement using inclusive scattering from the mirror
nuclei $^3$H and $^3$He to extract the np/pp ratio of SRCs in the A=3 system.
We obtain a measure of the np/pp SRC ratio that is an order of magnitude more
precise than previous experiments, and find a dramatic deviation from the
near-total np dominance observed in heavy nuclei. This result implies an
unexpected structure in the high-momentum wavefunction for $^3$He and $^3$H.
Understanding these results will improve our understanding of the short-range
part of the N-N interaction.

extragalactic transients of unclear physical origin. A variety of mechanisms
have been proposed including failed supernova explosion, shock interaction with
a dense medium, young magnetar, accretion onto a compact object, and stellar
tidal disruption event, but none is conclusive. Here we report the discovery of
a possible X-ray quasi-periodicity signal with a period of $\sim$250 second (at
a significance level of 99.76%) in the brightest FBOT AT2018cow through the
analysis of XMM-Newton/PN data. The signal is independently detected at the
same frequency in the average power density spectrum from data taken from the
Swift telescope, with observations covering from 6 to 37 days after the optical
discovery, though the significance level is lower (94.26%). This suggests that
the QPO frequency may be stable over at least 1.1$\times$ 10$^{4}$ cycles.
Assuming the $\sim$250 second QPO to be a scaled-down analogue of that
typically seen in stellar mass black holes, a black hole mass of
$\sim10^{3}-10^{5}$ solar masses could be inferred. The overall X-ray
luminosity evolution could be modeled with the stellar tidal disruption by a
black hole of $\sim10^4$ solar masses, providing a viable mechanism to produce
AT2018cow. Our findings suggest that other bright FBOTs may also harbor
intermediate-mass black holes.

state when the fraction of inactive oscillators surpasses a critical value.
However, the aging transition in quantum domain has not been studied yet. In
this paper we investigate the quantum manifestation of aging transition in a

oscillation but by sufficient reduction in the mean boson number. We identify a
critical ``knee"" value in the fraction of inactive oscillators around which
quantum aging occurs in two different ways. Further, in stark contrast to the

have demonstrated great potential in accelerating the simulations of coupled
fluid-structure systems for downstream optimization and control tasks. However,
these networks have to operate on a uniform Cartesian grid due to the inherent
restriction of convolutions, leading to difficulties in extracting fine
physical details along a fluid-structure interface without excessive
computational burden. In this work, we present a quasi-monolithic graph neural
network framework for the reduced-order modelling of fluid-structure
interaction systems. With the aid of an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian
formulation, the mesh and fluid states are evolved temporally with two
sub-networks. The movement of the mesh is reduced to the evolution of several
coefficients via proper orthogonal decomposition, and these coefficients are
propagated through time via a multi-layer perceptron. A graph neural network is
employed to predict the evolution of the fluid state based on the state of the
whole system. The structural state is implicitly modelled by the movement of
the mesh on the fluid-structure boundary; hence it makes the proposed
data-driven methodology quasi-monolithic. The effectiveness of the proposed
quasi-monolithic graph neural network architecture is assessed on a
prototypical fluid-structure system of the flow around an elastically-mounted
cylinder. We use the full-order flow snapshots and displacements as target
physical data to learn and infer coupled fluid-structure dynamics. The proposed
framework tracks the interface description and provides the state predictions
during roll-out with acceptable accuracy. We also directly extract the lift and
drag forces from the predicted fluid and mesh states, in contrast to existing
convolution-based architectures.

models. Recent progress in training methods has enabled successful deep SNNs on
large-scale tasks with low latency. Particularly, backpropagation through time
(BPTT) with surrogate gradients (SG) is popularly used to achieve high
performance in a very small number of time steps. However, it is at the cost of
large memory consumption for training, lack of theoretical clarity for
optimization, and inconsistency with the online property of biological learning
and rules on neuromorphic hardware. Other works connect spike representations
of SNNs with equivalent artificial neural network formulation and train SNNs by
gradients from equivalent mappings to ensure descent directions. But they fail
to achieve low latency and are also not online. In this work, we propose online
training through time (OTTT) for SNNs, which is derived from BPTT to enable
forward-in-time learning by tracking presynaptic activities and leveraging
instantaneous loss and gradients. Meanwhile, we theoretically analyze and prove
that gradients of OTTT can provide a similar descent direction for optimization
as gradients based on spike representations under both feedforward and
recurrent conditions. OTTT only requires constant training memory costs
agnostic to time steps, avoiding the significant memory costs of BPTT for GPU
training. Furthermore, the update rule of OTTT is in the form of three-factor
Hebbian learning, which could pave a path for online on-chip learning. With
OTTT, it is the first time that two mainstream supervised SNN training methods,
BPTT with SG and spike representation-based training, are connected, and
meanwhile in a biologically plausible form. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,

interests in industry and research communities. We present a new method for
real-time SR for computer graphics, namely Super-Resolution by Predicting
Offsets (SRPO). Our algorithm divides the image into two parts for processing,
i.e., sharp edges and flatter areas. For edges, different from the previous SR
methods that take the anti-aliased images as inputs, our proposed SRPO takes
advantage of the characteristics of rasterized images to conduct SR on the
rasterized images. To complement the residual between HR and low-resolution
(LR) rasterized images, we train an ultra-efficient network to predict the
offset maps to move the appropriate surrounding pixels to the new positions.
For flat areas, we found simple interpolation methods can already generate
reasonable output. We finally use a guided fusion operation to integrate the
sharp edges generated by the network and flat areas by the interpolation method
to get the final SR image. The proposed network only contains 8,434 parameters
and can be accelerated by network quantization. Extensive experiments show that
the proposed SRPO can achieve superior visual effects at a smaller
computational cost than the existing state-of-the-art methods.

logarithmic T-dependent electronic specific heat at low temperature are also
observed to coexist with the high thermopower, highlighting the strong
intercoupling of the non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) quantum critical behavior of
electrons with TE transports. Electronic structure analysis reveals the
existence of fluctuating Fe-eg-related local magnetic moments, Fe-Fe
antiferromagnetic (AFM) interaction at the nearest 4c-4d sites, and two-fold
degenerate eg orbitals antiferromagnetically coupled with the dual-type
itinerant electrons close to the Fermi level, all of which infer to a
competition between the AFM ordering and Kondo-like spin compensation as well
as a parallel two-channel Kondo effect. These effects are both strongly
meditated by the structural disorder due to the random filling of Fe/Cu at the
equivalent 4c/4d sites of the Heusler crystal lattice. The magnetic
susceptibility deviates from ideal antiferromagnetism but can be fitted well by
x(T) = 1/({\theta} + BT{\alpha}), seemingly being consistent with the quantum
critical scenario of strong local correlation as discussed before. Our work not
only breaks the dilemma that the promising TE materials should be heavily-doped

  Meta-Reinforcement Learning","NeurIPS 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Adapting to the changes in transition dynamics is essential in robotic
applications. By learning a conditional policy with a compact context,
context-aware meta-reinforcement learning provides a flexible way to adjust
behavior according to dynamics changes. However, in real-world applications,
the agent may encounter complex dynamics changes. Multiple confounders can
influence the transition dynamics, making it challenging to infer accurate
context for decision-making. This paper addresses such a challenge by
Decomposed Mutual INformation Optimization (DOMINO) for context learning, which
explicitly learns a disentangled context to maximize the mutual information
between the context and historical trajectories, while minimizing the state
transition prediction error. Our theoretical analysis shows that DOMINO can
overcome the underestimation of the mutual information caused by
multi-confounded challenges via learning disentangled context and reduce the
demand for the number of samples collected in various environments. Extensive
experiments show that the context learned by DOMINO benefits both model-based
and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms for dynamics generalization in
terms of sample efficiency and performance in unseen environments.

pure feedback system with pure state constraints on the state variables and
unknown time-varying bounded disturbances. An adaptive controller is presented
for such systems for the very first time. The controller is designed using the
backstepping method. While designing it, Barrier Lyapunov Functions is used so
that the state variables do not contravene its constraints. In order to cope
with the unknown dynamics of the system, an online approximator is designed
using a neural network with a novel adaptive law for its weight update. In the
stability analysis of the system, the time derivative of Lyapunov function
involves known virtual control coefficient with unknown direction and to deal
with such problem Nussbaum gain is used to design the control law. Furthermore,
to make the controller robust and computationally inexpensive, a novel
disturbance observer is designed to estimate the disturbance along with neural
network approximation error and the time derivative of virtual control input.
The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a simulation
study on the third-order nonlinear system.

of its original distribution makes different models hardly classify the image
correctly, which benefits the untargeted attack, and dragging the image into
the target distribution misleads the models to classify the image as the target
class, which benefits the targeted attack. Towards this end, we propose a novel
method that crafts adversarial examples by manipulating the distribution of the

demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our method can
significantly improve the transferability of the crafted attacks and achieves

set of input images taken from different viewpoints. The fewer the number of
viewpoints, the higher the likelihood of overfitting on them. This paper
mitigates such limitation by presenting a novel data augmentation approach to
generate geometrically consistent image transitions between viewpoints using
view morphing. View morphing is a highly versatile technique that does not
requires any prior knowledge about the 3D scene because it is based on general
principles of projective geometry. A key novelty of our method is to use the
very same depths predicted by NeRF to generate the image transitions that are
then added to NeRF training. We experimentally show that this procedure enables
NeRF to improve the quality of its synthesised novel views in the case of
datasets with few training viewpoints. We improve PSNR up to 1.8dB and 10.5dB
when eight and four views are used for training, respectively. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first data augmentation strategy for NeRF that
explicitly synthesises additional new input images to improve the model
generalisation.

an object from a set of posed multi-view images under unknown lighting. NReF
represents 3D geometry and appearance of objects in a disentangled manner, and
are hard to be estimated from images only. Our method solves this problem by
exploiting the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) as a proxy representation, from
which we perform further decomposition. A high-quality NeRF decomposition
relies on good geometry information extraction as well as good prior terms to
properly resolve ambiguities between different components. To extract
high-quality geometry information from radiance fields, we re-design a new
ray-casting based method for surface point extraction. To efficiently compute
and apply prior terms, we convert different prior terms into different type of
filter operations on the surface extracted from radiance field. We then employ
two type of auxiliary data structures, namely Gaussian KD-tree and octree, to
support fast querying of surface points and efficient computation of surface
filters during training. Based on this, we design a multi-stage decomposition
optimization pipeline for estimating neural reflectance field from neural
radiance fields. Extensive experiments show our method outperforms other

easily catch noisy words irrelevant to the current aspect category, which

are mutually noisy and confuse the classifier seriously. In this paper, we
resort to the label information of each aspect to tackle the above problems,

generating accurate and transferable potentials the most time-consuming and
arguably most important task is generating the training set, which still
requires significant expert user input. To accelerate this process, this work
presents \text{\it hyperactive learning} (HAL), a framework for formulating an
accelerated sampling algorithm specifically for the task of training database
generation. The key idea is to start from a physically motivated sampler (e.g.,
molecular dynamics) and add a biasing term that drives the system towards high
uncertainty and thus to unseen training configurations. Building on this
framework, general protocols for building training databases for alloys and
polymers leveraging the HAL framework will be presented. For alloys, ACE
potentials for AlSi10 are created by fitting to a minimal HAL-generated
database containing 88 configurations (32 atoms each) with fast evaluation
times of <100 microsecond/atom/cpu-core. These potentials are demonstrated to
predict the melting temperature with excellent accuracy. For polymers, a HAL
database is built using ACE, able to determine the density of a long
polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer formed of 200 monomer units with experimental
accuracy by only fitting to small isolated PEG polymers with sizes ranging from
2 to 32.

recognizing abnormal images to assist in diagnosis. Due to the high-cost
annotations of abnormal images, most methods utilize only known normal images
during training and identify samples deviating from the normal profile as
anomalies in the testing phase. Many readily available unlabeled images
containing anomalies are thus ignored in the training phase, restricting the
performance. To solve this problem, we introduce one-class semi-supervised
learning (OC-SSL) to utilize known normal and unlabeled images for training,
and propose Dual-distribution Discrepancy for Anomaly Detection (DDAD) based on
this setting. Ensembles of reconstruction networks are designed to model the
distribution of normal images and the distribution of both normal and unlabeled
images, deriving the normative distribution module (NDM) and unknown
distribution module (UDM). Subsequently, the intra-discrepancy of NDM and
inter-discrepancy between the two modules are designed as anomaly scores.
Furthermore, we propose a new perspective on self-supervised learning, which is
designed to refine the anomaly scores rather than detect anomalies directly.
Five medical datasets, including chest X-rays, brain MRIs and retinal fundus
images, are organized as benchmarks for evaluation. Experiments on these
benchmarks comprehensively compare a wide range of anomaly detection methods
and demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains and outperforms the
state-of-the-art. Code and organized benchmarks are available at

that has received minimal attention in the research literature. In light of
this, we consider a classical random access (RA) problem, where uncoordinated
users' equipment (UEs) transmit sporadically to an access point (AP).
Differently from previous works, we ponder how a RIS can be integrated into the
design of new medium access control (MAC) layer protocols to solve such a
problem. We consider that the AP is able to control a RIS to change how its
reflective elements are configured, namely, the RIS configurations. Thus, the
RIS can be opportunistically controlled to favor the transmission of some of
the UEs without the need to explicitly perform channel estimation (CHEST). We
embrace this observation and propose a RIS-assisted RA protocol comprised of
two modules: Channel Oracle and Access. During channel oracle, the UEs learn
how the RIS configurations affect their channel conditions. During the access,
the UEs tailor their access policies using the channel oracle knowledge. Our
proposed RIS-assisted protocol is able to increase the expected throughput by
approximately 60% in comparison to the slotted ALOHA (S-ALOHA) protocol.

multi-view images captured from a day-to-day commodity camera. Although
recently proposed Mip-NeRF could handle multi-scale imaging problems with NeRF,
it cannot handle camera pose estimation error. On the other hand, the newly
proposed BARF can solve the camera pose problem with NeRF but fails if the
images are multi-scale in nature. This paper presents a robust multi-scale
neural radiance fields representation approach to simultaneously overcome both
real-world imaging issues. Our method handles multi-scale imaging effects and
camera-pose estimation problems with NeRF-inspired approaches by leveraging the
fundamentals of scene rigidity. To reduce unpleasant aliasing artifacts due to
multi-scale images in the ray space, we leverage Mip-NeRF multi-scale
representation. For joint estimation of robust camera pose, we propose
graph-neural network-based multiple motion averaging in the neural volume
rendering framework. We demonstrate, with examples, that for an accurate neural
representation of an object from day-to-day acquired multi-view images, it is
crucial to have precise camera-pose estimates. Without considering robustness
measures in the camera pose estimation, modeling for multi-scale aliasing
artifacts via conical frustum can be counterproductive. We present extensive
experiments on the benchmark datasets to demonstrate that our approach provides
better results than the recent NeRF-inspired approaches for such realistic

generative QA models. First, we decompose multi-hop questions into multiple
corresponding single-hop questions, and find marked inconsistency in QA models'
answers on these pairs of ostensibly identical question chains. Second, we find
that models lack zero-shot multi-hop reasoning ability: when trained only on
single-hop questions, models generalize poorly to multi-hop questions. Finally,
we demonstrate that it is possible to improve models' zero-shot multi-hop
reasoning capacity through two methods that approximate real multi-hop natural

the resulting influence on its function due to oxidative damage of its

double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with its guanine bases being oxidized. The guanine
bases are more prone to oxidative damage due to the lowest value of redox
potential among all nucleobases. We have analyzed the local as well as global
mechanical properties of native and oxidized dsDNA and explained those results
by microscopic structural parameters and thermodynamic calculations. Our
results show that the oxidative damage of dsDNA does not deform the
Watson-Crick geometry; instead, the oxidized DNA structures are found to be
better stabilized through electrostatic interactions. Moreover, oxidative
damage changes the mechanical, helical, and groove parameters of dsDNA. The
persistence length, stretch modulus, and torsional stiffness are found to be
48.87 nm, 1239.26 pN, and 477.30 pN.nm^2, respectively, for native dsDNA, and
these values are 61.31 nm, 659.91 pN, and 407.79 pN.nm^2, respectively, when

Broadly, it distinguishes between spontaneous and posed smiles. Previous
approaches used hand-engineered features from facial landmarks or considered
raw smile videos in an end-to-end manner to perform smile classification tasks.
Feature-based methods require intervention from human experts on feature
engineering and heavy pre-processing steps. On the contrary, raw smile video
inputs fed into end-to-end models bring more automation to the process with the
cost of considering many redundant facial features (beyond landmark locations)
that are mainly irrelevant to smile veracity classification. It remains unclear
to establish discriminative features from landmarks in an end-to-end manner. We
present a MeshSmileNet framework, a transformer architecture, to address the
above limitations. To eliminate redundant facial features, our landmarks input
is extracted from Attention Mesh, a pre-trained landmark detector. Again, to
discover discriminative features, we consider the relativity and trajectory of
the landmarks. For the relativity, we aggregate facial landmark that
conceptually formats a curve at each frame to establish local spatial features.
For the trajectory, we estimate the movements of landmark composed features
across time by self-attention mechanism, which captures pairwise dependency on
the trajectory of the same landmark. This idea allows us to achieve
state-of-the-art performances on UVA-NEMO, BBC, MMI Facial Expression, and SPOS

These compact remnants of dead stars -- the Galactic underworld -- are found to
exhibit a fundamentally different distribution and structure to the visible
Galaxy. Compared to the visible Galaxy, concentration into a thin flattened
disk structure is much less evident with the scale height more than tripling to
1260 +- 30 pc. This difference arises from two primary causes. Firstly, the
distribution is in part inherited from the integration over the evolving
structure of the Galaxy itself (and hence the changing distribution of the
parent stars). Secondly, an even larger effect arises from the natal kick
received by the remnant at the event of its supernova birth. Due to this kick
we find 30% of remnants have sufficient kinetic energy to entirely escape the
Galactic potential (40% of neutron stars and 2% of black holes) leading to a
Galactic mass loss integrated to the present day of ~ 0.4% of the stellar mass
of the Galaxy. The black hole -- neutron star fraction increases near the
Galactic centre: a consequence of smaller kick velocities in the former (the
assumption made is that kick velocity is inversely proportional to mass). Our
simulated remnant distribution yields probable distances of 19 pc and 21 pc to
the nearest neutron star and black hole respectively, while our nearest
probable magnetar lies at 4.2 kpc. Although the underworld only contains of
order ~ 1% of the Galaxy's mass, observational signatures and physical traces
of its population, such as microlensing, will become increasingly present in
data ranging from gravitational wave detectors to high precision surveys from
space missions such as Gaia.

the lensless imaging model U-Net, the text detection model connectionist text

by enhancing factors related to character categories in the reconstruction

been several attempts to constrain the nature of clusters (accreted or formed
in the MW itself) through the analysis of kinematic spaces and to reconstruct
from this the properties of the accretions events experienced by the MW through
time. This work aims to test a widely-used assumption about the clustering of
the accreted populations of GCs in the integrals of motions space. We analyze a
set of dissipation-less N-body simulations that reproduce the accretion of one
or two satellites with their GC population on a MW-type galaxy. Our results
demonstrate that a significant overlap between accreted and
""kinematically-heated"" in-situ GCs is expected in kinematic spaces, for mergers
with mass ratios of 1:10. In contrast with standard assumptions made in the
literature so far, we find that accreted GCs do not show dynamical coherence,
that is they do not cluster in kinematic spaces. In addition, GCs can also be
found in regions dominated by stars which have a different origin (i.e.
different progenitor). This casts doubt on the association between GCs and
field stars that is generally made in the literature to assign them to a common
origin. Our findings severely question the recovered accretion history of the

unable to capture the associative semantics of the same distance and the
opposite directions, which in turn affects the performance of downstream tasks.
Secondly, we notice the BERT with Mask Language Modeling (MLM) pre-training

different tokens) and head representations (attention weights of different
heads), which may make the diversity of information expressed by different
tokens and heads limited. Motivated by the above investigation, we propose two
novel techniques to improve pre-trained language models: Decoupled Directional
Relative Position (DDRP) encoding and MTH pre-training objective. DDRP
decouples the relative distance features and the directional features in
classical relative position encoding. MTH applies two novel auxiliary
regularizers besides MLM to enlarge the dissimilarities between (a) last hidden
states of different tokens, and (b) attention weights of different heads. These
designs allow the model to capture different categories of information more
clearly, as a way to alleviate information confusion in representation learning

relatively wide direct band gap of a flat GeC nanosheet can be changed by
tuning the planar buckling. A GeC monolayer has an sp$^2$ hybridization in
which the contribution of an $s$-orbital is half of the contribution of a
$p$-orbital leading to stronger $\sigma\text{-}\sigma$ bonds compared to the
$\sigma\text{-}\pi$ bonds. Increasing the planar buckling, the contribution of
an $s$-orbital is decreased while the contribution of a $p$-orbital is
increased resulting in a sp$^3$-hybridization in which the $\sigma\text{-}\pi$
bond becomes stronger than the $\sigma\text{-}\sigma$ bond. As a result, the
band gap of a buckled GeC is reduced and thus the thermal and the optical
properties are significantly modified. We find that the heat capacity of the
buckled GeC is decreased at low values of planar buckling, which is caused by
the anticrossing of the optical and the acoustic phonon modes affecting phonon
scattering processes. The resulting optical properties, such as the dielectric
function, the refractive index, the electron energy loss spectra, the
absorption, and the optical conductivity show that a buckled GeC nanosheet has
increased optical activities in the visible light region compared to a flat
GeC. The optical conductivity is red shifted from the near ultraviolet to the
visible light region, when the planar buckling is increased. We can thus
confirm that the buckling can be seen as another parameter to improve GeC
monolayers for optoelectronic devices.

requires careful attention to be detected and removed from applications before
getting exploited and harming the system users. Symbolic execution is a
well-known method for analyzing programs and detecting various vulnerabilities,
e.g., memory corruption. Although this method is sound and complete in theory,
it faces some challenges, such as path explosion, when applied to real-world
complex programs. In this paper, we present a method for improving the
efficiency of symbolic execution and detecting four classes of memory
corruption vulnerabilities in executable codes, i.e., heap-based buffer
overflow, stack-based buffer overflow, use-after-free, and double-free. We
perform symbolic execution only on test units rather than the whole program to
avoid path explosion. In our method, test units are considered parts of the
program's code, which might contain vulnerable statements and are statically
identified based on the specifications of memory corruption vulnerabilities.
Then, each test unit is symbolically executed to calculate path and
vulnerability constraints of each statement of the unit, which determine the
conditions on unit input data for executing that statement or activating
vulnerabilities in it, respectively. Solving these constraints gives us input
values for the test unit, which execute the desired statements and reveal
vulnerabilities in them. Finally, we use machine learning to approximate the
correlation between system and unit input data. Thereby, we generate system
inputs that enter the program, reach vulnerable instructions in the desired
test unit, and reveal vulnerabilities in them. This method is implemented as a
plugin for angr framework and evaluated using a group of benchmark programs.
The experiments show its superiority over similar tools in accuracy and
performance.

  three-dimensional turbulence","36 pages, 19 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Modeling three-dimensional (3D) turbulence by neural networks is difficult
because 3D turbulence is highly-nonlinear with high degrees of freedom and the
corresponding simulation is memory-intensive. Recently, the attention mechanism
has been shown as a promising approach to boost the performance of neural
networks on turbulence simulation. However, the standard self-attention
mechanism uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to input dimension $n$, and
such quadratic complexity has become the main bottleneck for attention to be
applied on 3D turbulence simulation. In this work, we resolve this issue with
the concept of linear attention network. The linear attention approximates the
standard attention by adding two linear projections, reducing the overall
self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The
linear attention coupled Fourier neural operator (LAFNO) is developed for the
simulation of 3D turbulence. Numerical simulations show that the linear
attention mechanism provides 40\% error reduction at the same level of
computational cost, and LAFNO can accurately reconstruct a variety of
statistics and instantaneous spatial structures of 3D turbulence. The linear
attention method would be helpful for the improvement of neural network models
of 3D nonlinear problems involving high-dimensional data in other scientific
domains.

model to enhance the robustness of machine learning with ambiguous data.
However, the complexity of \textsf{WDRO} can be prohibitive in practice since
solving its ``minimax'' formulation requires a great amount of computation.
Recently, several fast \textsf{WDRO} training algorithms for some specific
machine learning tasks (e.g., logistic regression) have been developed.
However, the research on designing efficient algorithms for general large-scale
\textsf{WDRO}s is still quite limited, to the best of our knowledge.
\textit{Coreset} is an important tool for compressing large dataset, and thus
it has been widely applied to reduce the computational complexities for many
optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework to
construct the $\epsilon$-coreset for the general \textsf{WDRO} problems. Though
it is challenging to obtain a conventional coreset for \textsf{WDRO} due to the
uncertainty issue of ambiguous data, we show that we can compute a ``dual
coreset'' by using the strong duality property of \textsf{WDRO}. Also, the
error introduced by the dual coreset can be theoretically guaranteed for the
original \textsf{WDRO} objective. To construct the dual coreset, we propose a
novel grid sampling approach that is particularly suitable for the dual
formulation of \textsf{WDRO}. Finally, we implement our coreset approach and
illustrate its effectiveness for several \textsf{WDRO} problems in the
experiments.

overwhelming majority of work relies on N-grams. Limited efforts have been made
to evaluate how well N-gram methods perform, in part because it is unclear how

study uses the unique timeliness of historical news wires to create a 27,210

noise-robust de-duplication. The time-sensitivity of news makes comprehensive
hand labelling feasible - despite the massive overall size of the corpus - as

evaluates a range of de-duplication methods: hashing and N-gram overlap (which
predominate in the literature), a contrastively trained bi-encoder, and a
re-rank style approach combining a bi- and cross-encoder. The neural approaches
significantly outperform hashing and N-gram overlap. We show that the

continuous attention, which makes it possible to identify salient objects in

the existing RGB-T SOD models focus on how to perform cross-modality feature
fusion, ignoring whether thermal image is really always matter in SOD task.
Starting from the definition and nature of this task, this paper rethinks the
connotation of thermal modality, and proposes a network named TNet to solve the
RGB-T SOD task. In this paper, we introduce a global illumination estimation
module to predict the global illuminance score of the image, so as to regulate
the role played by the two modalities. In addition, considering the role of
thermal modality, we set up different cross-modality interaction mechanisms in
the encoding phase and the decoding phase. On the one hand, we introduce a
semantic constraint provider to enrich the semantics of thermal images in the
encoding phase, which makes thermal modality more suitable for the SOD task. On
the other hand, we introduce a two-stage localization and complementation
module in the decoding phase to transfer object localization cue and internal
integrity cue in thermal features to the RGB modality. Extensive experiments on
three datasets show that the proposed TNet achieves competitive performance

rate (FSR), defined as the expected fraction of erroneous classifications among

off a fraction of indecisions for fewer classification errors. We develop a new

in the context of high-dimensional linear discriminant analysis (LDA). LASS is
easy-to-analyze and has robust performance across sparse and dense regimes.
Theoretical guarantees on FSR control are established without strong

hyperspectral image (HSI) processing, the anomalous change detection task
focuses on detecting very small changes among different temporal images.

violates the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and smoothly connects to the previously

based on the most commonly-used Time Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (TLIF) model, we
develop the Location Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LLIF) model. Moreover, to
demonstrate the representation effectiveness of our proposed neurons and
capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in the event-driven tactile
data, we exploit the location spiking neurons to propose two hybrid models for
event-driven tactile learning. Specifically, the first hybrid model combines a
fully-connected SNN with TSRM neurons and a fully-connected SNN with LSRM
neurons. And the second hybrid model fuses the spatial spiking graph neural
network with TLIF neurons and the temporal spiking graph neural network with
LLIF neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements of
our models over the state-of-the-art methods on event-driven tactile learning.
Moreover, compared to the counterpart artificial neural networks (ANNs), our
SNN models are 10x to 100x energy-efficient, which shows the superior energy
efficiency of our models and may bring new opportunities to the spike-based
learning community and neuromorphic engineering.

scans requires the simultaneous segmentation of abdominal organs. Thanks to the
availability of high-performance computational resources, deep learning-based
methods have resulted in state-of-the-art performance for the segmentation of
3D abdominal CT scans. However, the complex characterization of organs with
fuzzy boundaries prevents the deep learning methods from accurately segmenting
these anatomical organs. Specifically, the voxels on the boundary of organs are
more vulnerable to misprediction due to the highly-varying intensity of
inter-organ boundaries. This paper investigates the possibility of improving
the abdominal image segmentation performance of the existing 3D encoder-decoder
networks by leveraging organ-boundary prediction as a complementary task. To
address the problem of abdominal multi-organ segmentation, we train the 3D
encoder-decoder network to simultaneously segment the abdominal organs and
their corresponding boundaries in CT scans via multi-task learning. The network
is trained end-to-end using a loss function that combines two task-specific
losses, i.e., complete organ segmentation loss and boundary prediction loss. We
explore two different network topologies based on the extent of weights shared
between the two tasks within a unified multi-task framework. To evaluate the
utilization of complementary boundary prediction task in improving the
abdominal multi-organ segmentation, we use three state-of-the-art
encoder-decoder networks: 3D UNet, 3D UNet++, and 3D Attention-UNet. The
effectiveness of utilizing the organs' boundary information for abdominal
multi-organ segmentation is evaluated on two publically available abdominal CT
datasets. A maximum relative improvement of 3.5% and 3.6% is observed in Mean
Dice Score for Pancreas-CT and BTCV datasets, respectively.

are difficult to train and suffer from mode collapse issue, which prevents the
hashing approaches from jointly training the generative models and the hash

blur kernel assumption. Since the kernel uncertainty (i.e. kernel error) is
inevitable in practice, semi-blind deblurring is suggested to handle it by
introducing the prior of the kernel (or induced) error. However, how to design
a suitable prior for the kernel (or induced) error remains challenging.
Hand-crafted prior, incorporating domain knowledge, generally performs well but
may lead to poor performance when kernel (or induced) error is complex.
Data-driven prior, which excessively depends on the diversity and abundance of
training data, is vulnerable to out-of-distribution blurs and images. To
address this challenge, we suggest a dataset-free deep residual prior for the
kernel induced error (termed as residual) expressed by a customized untrained
deep neural network, which allows us to flexibly adapt to different blurs and
images in real scenarios. By organically integrating the respective strengths
of deep priors and hand-crafted priors, we propose an unsupervised semi-blind
deblurring model which recovers the latent image from the blurry image and
inaccurate blur kernel. To tackle the formulated model, an efficient
alternating minimization algorithm is developed. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed method as compared to
data-driven and model-driven methods in terms of image quality and the
robustness to the kernel error.

graph-structured data based on graph original information, including node
features and graph structures, and have shown astonishing improvement in node
classification tasks. However, the expressive power of MPNNs is upper bounded
by the first-order Weisfeiler-Leman test and its accuracy still has room for
improvement. This work studies how to improve MPNNs' expressiveness and
generalizability by fully exploiting graph original information both
theoretically and empirically. It further proposes a new GNN model called INGNN

range is imperative for numerous applications such as RF photonic links for 5G

is found that that modulator spurious free dynamic range has a strong
