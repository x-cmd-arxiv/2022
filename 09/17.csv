for IoT data analytics. However, applying ML models to IoT data analytics tasks
still faces many difficulties and challenges, specifically, effective model
selection, design/tuning, and updating, which have brought massive demand for
experienced data scientists. Additionally, the dynamic nature of IoT data may
introduce concept drift issues, causing model performance degradation. To
reduce human efforts, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has become a popular
field that aims to automatically select, construct, tune, and update machine
learning models to achieve the best performance on specified tasks. In this
paper, we conduct a review of existing methods in the model selection, tuning,

summarize the optimal solutions for every step of applying ML algorithms to IoT

(BST) data structure: in STTs the underlying search space is an arbitrary tree,
whereas in BSTs it is a path. An optimal BST of size $n$ can be computed for a
given distribution of queries in $O(n^2)$ time [Knuth 1971] and centroid BSTs
provide a nearly-optimal alternative, computable in $O(n)$ time [Mehlhorn
1977].
  By contrast, optimal STTs are not known to be computable in polynomial time,
and the fastest constant-approximation algorithm runs in $O(n^3)$ time
[Berendsohn, Kozma 2022]. Centroid trees can be defined for STTs analogously to
BSTs, and they have been used in a wide range of algorithmic applications. In
the unweighted case (i.e., for a uniform distribution of queries), a centroid
tree can be computed in $O(n)$ time [Brodal et al. 2001; Della Giustina et al.
2019]. These algorithms, however, do not readily extend to the weighted case.
Moreover, no approximation guarantees were previously known for centroid trees
in either the unweighted or weighted cases.
  In this paper we revisit centroid trees in a general, weighted setting, and
we settle both the algorithmic complexity of constructing them, and the quality
of their approximation. For constructing a weighted centroid tree, we give an
output-sensitive $O(n\log h)\subseteq O(n\log n)$ time algorithm, where $h$ is
the height of the resulting centroid tree. If the weights are of polynomial
complexity, the running time is $O(n\log\log n)$. We show these bounds to be
optimal, in a general decision tree model of computation. For approximation, we
prove that the cost of a centroid tree is at most twice the optimum, and this
guarantee is best possible, both in the weighted and unweighted cases. We also
give tight, fine-grained bounds on the approximation-ratio for bounded-degree
trees and on the approximation-ratio of more general $\alpha$-centroid trees.

information retrieval. Nowadays, archiving is not enough anymore. The amount of
data that gets generated daily is beyond human comprehension, and appeals for
new information retrieval strategies. Instead of referencing every single data
piece as in traditional archival techniques, a more relevant approach consists
in understanding the overall ideas conveyed in data flows. To spot such general
tendencies, a precise comprehension of the underlying data generation
mechanisms is required. In the rich literature tackling this problem, the
question of information interaction remains nearly unexplored. First, we
investigate the frequency of such interactions. Building on recent advances
made in Stochastic Block Modelling, we explore the role of interactions in
several social networks. We find that interactions are rare in these datasets.
Then, we wonder how interactions evolve over time. Earlier data pieces should
not have an everlasting influence on ulterior data generation mechanisms. We
model this using dynamic network inference advances. We conclude that
interactions are brief. Finally, we design a framework that jointly models rare
and brief interactions based on Dirichlet-Hawkes Processes. We argue that this
new class of models fits brief and sparse interaction modelling. We conduct a
large-scale application on Reddit and find that interactions play a minor role
in this dataset. From a broader perspective, our work results in a collection
of highly flexible models and in a rethinking of core concepts of machine

  Methods: Generic nonlinear model-based reconstruction for quantitative MRI
estimates parametric maps directly from the acquired k-space by numerical
optimization. This requires numerically accurate and efficient methods to solve
the Bloch equations and their partial derivatives. In this work, we combine
direct sensitivity analysis and pre-computed state-transition matrices into a
generic framework for calibrationless model-based reconstruction that can be
applied to different pulse sequences. As a proof-of-concept, the method is
implemented and validated for quantitative $T_1$ and $T_2$ mapping with
single-shot inversion-recovery (IR) FLASH and IR bSSFP sequences in
simulations, phantoms, and the human brain.
  Results: The direct sensitivity analysis enables a highly accurate and
numerically stable calculation of the derivatives. The state-transition
matrices efficiently exploit repeating patterns in pulse sequences, speeding up
the calculation by a factor of 10 for the examples considered in this work,
while preserving the accuracy of native ODE solvers. The generic model-based
method reproduces quantitative results of previous model-based reconstructions
based on the known analytical solutions for radial IR FLASH. For IR bSFFP it
produces accurate $T_1$ and $T_2$ maps for the NIST phantom in numerical
simulations and experiments. Feasibility is also shown for human brain,

  Characterization","28 pages, 13 figures, published at NeurIPS 2022",,,,"cs.LG stat.ME stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The combinatorial problem of learning directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from
data was recently framed as a purely continuous optimization problem by
leveraging a differentiable acyclicity characterization of DAGs based on the
trace of a matrix exponential function. Existing acyclicity characterizations
are based on the idea that powers of an adjacency matrix contain information
about walks and cycles. In this work, we propose a new acyclicity
characterization based on the log-determinant (log-det) function, which
leverages the nilpotency property of DAGs. To deal with the inherent
asymmetries of a DAG, we relate the domain of our log-det characterization to
the set of $\textit{M-matrices}$, which is a key difference to the classical
log-det function defined over the cone of positive definite matrices. Similar
to acyclicity functions previously proposed, our characterization is also exact
and differentiable. However, when compared to existing characterizations, our
log-det function: (1) Is better at detecting large cycles; (2) Has
better-behaved gradients; and (3) Its runtime is in practice about an order of
magnitude faster. From the optimization side, we drop the typically used
augmented Lagrangian scheme and propose DAGMA ($\textit{DAGs via M-matrices for
Acyclicity}$), a method that resembles the central path for barrier methods.
Each point in the central path of DAGMA is a solution to an unconstrained
problem regularized by our log-det function, then we show that at the limit of
the central path the solution is guaranteed to be a DAG. Finally, we provide
extensive experiments for $\textit{linear}$ and $\textit{nonlinear}$ SEMs and
show that our approach can reach large speed-ups and smaller structural Hamming
distances against state-of-the-art methods. Code implementing the proposed
method is open-source and publicly available at

avoids atom collisions. With a high degree of parallelism, our algorithm offers
a reduced move complexity compared to both single-tweezer algorithms and
existing multi-tweezer algorithms. We further determine the optimal degree of
parallelism to be a balance between an algorithmic speedup and multi-tweezer
inhomogeneity effects. The defect-free probability for a 225-atom array is
demonstrated to be as high as 33(1)% in a room temperature setup after multiple

any target array geometry with an underlying periodic structure.

explain the data almost equally well. However, most learning algorithms return
only one of these models, leaving practitioners with no practical way to
explore alternative models that might have desirable properties beyond what
could be expressed within a loss function. The Rashomon set is the set of these
all almost-optimal models. Rashomon sets can be extremely complicated,
particularly for highly nonlinear function classes that allow complex
interaction terms, such as decision trees. We provide the first technique for
completely enumerating the Rashomon set for sparse decision trees; in fact, our
work provides the first complete enumeration of any Rashomon set for a
non-trivial problem with a highly nonlinear discrete function class. This
allows the user an unprecedented level of control over model choice among all
models that are approximately equally good. We represent the Rashomon set in a
specialized data structure that supports efficient querying and sampling. We
show three applications of the Rashomon set: 1) it can be used to study
variable importance for the set of almost-optimal trees (as opposed to a single
tree), 2) the Rashomon set for accuracy enables enumeration of the Rashomon
sets for balanced accuracy and F1-score, and 3) the Rashomon set for a full
dataset can be used to produce Rashomon sets constructed with only subsets of
the data set. Thus, we are able to examine Rashomon sets across problems with a
new lens, enabling users to choose models rather than be at the mercy of an

their interactions at both the largest and smallest scales of the universe.
This typically means probing very high energies or large distances or using
high-intensity beams, which often requires large-scale experiments. A
complementary approach is offered through high-precision measurements in small-
and mid-scale size experiments, often at lower energies. The field of such
high-precision experiments has seen tremendous progress and importance for
particle physics for at least two reasons. First, they exploit synergies to
adjacent areas of particle physics and benefit by many recent advances in
experimental techniques. Together with intensified phenomenological
explorations, these advances led to the realization that challenges associated
with weak couplings or the expected suppression factors from the mass scale of
new physics can be overcome with such methods. Second, many of these
measurements add a new set of particle physics phenomena and observables that
can be reached compared to the more conventional methodologies using high
energies. Combining high-precision, smaller-scale measurements with the
large-scale efforts therefore casts a wider and tighter net for possible
effects originating from physics beyond the Standard Model.
  This report presents a broad set of small-scale research projects that could
provide key new precision measurements in the areas of electric dipole moments,
magnetic dipole moments, fermion flavor violation, tests of spacetime
symmetries, and tests with gravity. The growing impact of these high-precision
studies in high energy physics and the complementary input they provide

In particular, EDM searches are expected to improve sensitivities by four or
more orders of magnitude in the next decade or two.

measures of Boolean functions is a thriving topic of research in computational
complexity. It is known that decision tree complexity is bounded above by the
cube of block sensitivity, and the cube of polynomial degree. However, the
widest separation between decision tree complexity and each of block
sensitivity and degree that is witnessed by known Boolean functions is
quadratic. In this work, we investigate the tightness of the existing cubic
upper bounds.
  We improve the cubic upper bounds for many interesting classes of Boolean
functions. We show that for graph properties and for functions with a constant
number of alternations, both of the cubic upper bounds can be improved to
quadratic. We define a class of Boolean functions, which we call the zebra
functions, that comprises Boolean functions where each monotone path from 0^n
to 1^n has an equal number of alternations. This class contains the symmetric
and monotone functions as its subclasses. We show that for any zebra function,
decision tree complexity is at most the square of block sensitivity, and
certificate complexity is at most the square of degree.
  Finally, we show using a lifting theorem of communication complexity by
G{\""{o}}{\""{o}}s, Pitassi and Watson that the task of proving an improved upper
bound on the decision tree complexity for all functions is in a sense
equivalent to the potentially easier task of proving a similar upper bound on
communication complexity for each bi-partition of the input variables, for all
functions. In particular, this implies that to bound the decision tree
complexity it suffices to bound smaller measures like parity decision tree
complexity, subcube decision tree complexity and decision tree rank, that are
defined in terms of models that can be efficiently simulated by communication
protocols.

severe symptoms. Furthermore, the framework accounts for the polarizing effect
of the decision to vaccinate and captures homophily, i.e., the tendency of
people to interact with like-minded individuals. By means of a mean-field
approach, we analytically derive the epidemic threshold. Our theoretical
results suggest that, while vaccination campaigns reduce pressure on hospitals,
they might facilitate resurgent outbreaks, highlighting the key role that
testing campaigns may have in eradicating the disease. Numerical simulations
are then employed to confirm and extend our theoretical findings to more
realistic scenarios. Our numerical and analytical results agree that
vaccination is not sufficient to achieve full eradication, without employing
massive testing campaigns or relying on the population's responsibility.
Furthermore, we show that homophily plays a critical role in the control of
local outbreaks, highlighting the peril of a polarized network structure.

of cosmic acceleration both in the modern universe and the inflationary epoch
would be provided by a new Stage V Spectroscopic Facility (Spec-S5) which would
combine a large telescope aperture, wide field of view, and high multiplexing.
Such a facility could simultaneously provide a dense sample of galaxies at
lower redshifts to provide robust measurements of the growth of structure at
small scales, as well as a sample at redshifts $2<z<5$ to measure cosmic
structure at the largest scales, spanning a sufficient volume to probe
primordial non-Gaussianity from inflation, to search for features in the
inflationary power spectrum on a broad range of scales, to test dark energy
models in poorly-explored regimes, and to determine the total neutrino mass and
effective number of light relics. A number of compelling opportunities at
smaller scales should also be pursued alongside Spec-S5. The science
collaborations analyzing DESI and LSST data will need funding for a variety of
activities, including cross-survey simulations and combined analyses. The
results from these experiments can be greatly improved by smaller programs to
obtain complementary data, including follow-up studies of supernovae and
spectroscopy to improve photometric redshift measurements. The best future use

utilized to handle both the spatial and temporal dimensions of the data. To

sizes within and across species, whilst maintaining archetypal qualities that
make it instantly recognisable as a ""brain"". Here we present a new way of
expressing the shape of a cortex explicitly as the hierarchical composition of
structures across spatial scales. In computational simulations, as one
successively removes sulci and gyri smaller than a specified scale, the
cortices of 11 primate species are gradually coarse-grained into less folded
brains until lyssencephaly (no folding). We show that this process, in all
cases, occurs along a common scale-free morphometric trajectory overlapping
with other mammalian species, indicating that these cortices are not only
approximately fractal in shape, but also, strikingly, are approximations of the
same archetypal fractal shape. These results imply the existence of a single
universal gyrification mechanism that operates in a scale-free manner on
cortical folds of all sizes, and that there are surprisingly few effective
degrees of freedom through which cortical shapes can be selected for by
evolution. Finally, we demonstrate that this new understanding can be of
practical use: biological processes can now be interrogated in a highly
scale-dependent way for increased sensitivity and precision. To our knowledge,
this is the most parsimonious universal description of the brain's shape that
is at the same time mechanistically insightful, practically useful, and in full
agreement with empirical data across species and individuals.

relaxation which results in a significant decrease in the electron mobility. We
report a new morphological evolution of a strained epitaxial SiGe nanolayer on
a silicon gate (mesa) driven by strain inhomogeneity due to finite-size

arises here due to the elastic inhomogeneity originating from the free
frontiers. We analyze the growth dynamics within the thermodynamic surface
diffusion framework accounting for elasticity and capillarity, the former being
solved in two dimensions thanks to the Airy formalism. The resulting dynamical
equation is solved with a decomposition on eigenmodes, and reveals different
developments depending upon the mesa geometric parameters. Mass transfer occurs
towards the relaxed areas and creates a beading at the nanolayers free surface
with either a W or V shape as a function of time and geometry. The evolution is
then controlled by the proportions of the structure as well as its scale.

a new path around the previous trajectory, with the risk of collision below the
threshold. Our method is well-suited to handle systems with uncertainties and
complicated dynamics as our data-driven approach does not need an analytical
form of the systems' dynamics and can estimate forward state density with an
arbitrary initial distribution of uncertainties. We design two challenging
scenarios (autonomous driving and hovercraft control) for safe motion planning
in environments with obstacles under system uncertainties. We first show that
our density estimation approach can reach a similar accuracy as the
Monte-Carlo-based method while using only 0.01X training samples. By leveraging
the estimated risk, our algorithm achieves the highest success rate in goal

a major issue for vehicular communication, specially, when the number of
vehicles increases at any given point. Vehicles also suffer some other problems
such as broadcast problem. Clustering can solve the issues of vehicular ad hoc
network (VANET); however, due to the high mobility of the vehicles, clustering
in VANET suffers stability issue. Previously proposed clustering algorithms for
VANET are optimized for either straight road or for intersection. Moreover, the
absence of the intelligent use of a combination of the mobility parameters,
such as direction, movement, position, velocity, degree of vehicle, movement at
the intersection etc., results in cluster stability issues. A dynamic
clustering algorithm considering the efficient use of all the mobility
parameters can solve the stability problem in VANET. To achieve higher
stability for VANET, a novel robust and dynamic clustering algorithm stable
dynamic predictive clustering (SDPC) for VANET is proposed in this paper. In
contrast to previous studies, vehicle relative velocity, vehicle position,
vehicle distance, transmission range, and vehicle density are considered in the
creation of a cluster, whereas relative distance, movement at the intersection,
degree of vehicles are considered to select the cluster head. From the mobility
parameters the future road scenario is constructed. The cluster is created, and
the cluster head is selected based on the future construction of the road. The
performance of SDPC is compared in terms of the average cluster head change
rate, the average cluster head duration, the average cluster member duration,
and the ratio of clustering overhead in terms of total packet transmission. The
simulation result shows SDPC outperforms the existing algorithms and achieved
better clustering stability.

across many research areas, including the modelling of migration, information

model are observed to deviate significantly from its mean-field approximation
even for large population sizes. We show that the disagreement between
deterministic and stochastic solutions stems from finite-size effects that
change the propagation speed and cause the position of the wave to fluctuate.
These effects are shown to decay anomalously as $(\log N)^{-2}$ and $(\log
N)^{-3}$, respectively -- much slower than the usual $N^{-1/2}$ factor. Our
results suggest that the accumulation of deleterious mutations in a Muller's
ratchet and the loss of awareness in a population may occur much faster than
predicted by the corresponding deterministic models. The general applicability
of our model suggests that this unexpected scaling could be important in a wide

since the interactions of photons and gluons are strongly constrained by the

experiments, which depend on the statistics of the collected data sample, the
experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties, and their correlations.
In addition it presents a combined interpretation of these results, together
with similar studies in the Higgs and top sector, in the Standard Model
effective field theory (SMEFT) framework. This framework provides a
model-independent prescription to put generic constraints on new physics and to
study and combine large sets of experimental observables, assuming that the new

models that only consider local pairs of spins. Associated to each pair is a
local quasi-conserved quantity, allowing us to describe the early time dynamics
of the system in terms of an integrable model similar to systems featuring
prethermalization. Since the dynamics of pairs are independent of the type of

systems have successfully grown single or low-density QDs, which are essential
for quantum light sources. In most other material systems, it is difficult to
realize low-density QDs, and the mesa-etching process is usually undergone in
order to reduce their density. Nevertheless, the etching process irreversibly
destroys the medium near the QD, which is detrimental to in-plane device
integration. In this study, we apply a nondestructive luminescence picking
method termed as nanoscale focus pinspot (NFP) using helium ion microscopy to
reduce the luminous QD density while retaining the surrounding medium. Given
that the NFP can precisely manipulate the luminescence at nanoscale resolution,
a photonic device can be deterministically fabricated on the target QD matched
from both spatial and spectral points of view. After applying the NFP, we
extract only a single QD emission out of the high-density ensemble QD emission.
Moreover, the photonic structure of a circular Bragg reflector is
deterministically integrated with the selected QD, and the extraction
efficiency of the QD emission has been improved 27 times. Furthermore, this
technique does not destroy the medium and only controls the luminescence.
Hence, it is highly applicable to various photonic structures, including
photonic waveguides or photonic crystal cavities regardless of their materials.

parameterizing the common circles in the two images. The second one assumes a
smooth motion over time and calculates the angular velocity of the rotational

using the stereographic projection, both methods can be reformulated as common

these constraints permits the application of embedding techniques like Cluster

physics of the pseudogap in cuprate high-temperature superconductors, namely
the existence or absence of Fermi arcs in the one-band Hubbard model. We study
the behavior of the Fermi surface and of the density of states as a function of
hole doping for clusters of up to 64 sites, well beyond the reach of modern
exact diagonalization solvers. We observe that the technique reliably captures
the transition from a Mott insulator at half filling to a pseudogap, evidenced
by the formation of Fermi arcs, and finally to a metallic state at large
doping. The ability to treat large clusters with quantum cluster methods helps
to minimize potential finite size effects and enables the study of systems with
long range orders, which will help extend the reach of these already powerful
methods and provide important insights on the nature of various strongly
correlated many-electron systems, including the high-T$_c$ cuprate

to overcome the problem of insufficient abnormal traffic labeled samples,

important role in deciphering the structure and composition of neutron stars

large-error bar, the recent mass estimate for the black-widow binary pulsar PSR
J0952-0607, i.e. $M=2.35\pm0.17~M_\odot$, provides the strongest lower bound on
$M_{\rm TOV}$ and suggests that neutron stars with very large masses can in
principle be observed. Adopting an agnostic modelling of the EOS, we study the
impact that large masses have on the neutron-star properties. In particular, we
show that assuming $M_{\rm TOV}\gtrsim 2.35\,M_\odot$ constrains tightly the
behaviour of the pressure as a function of the energy density and moves the
lower bounds for the stellar radii to values that are significantly larger than
those constrained by the NICER measurements, rendering the latter ineffective
in constraining the EOS. We also provide updated analytic expressions for the
lower bound on the binary tidal deformability in terms of the chirp mass and
show how larger bounds on $M_{\rm TOV}$ lead to tighter constraints for this
quantity. In addition, we point out a novel quasi-universal relation for the
pressure profile inside neutron stars that is only weakly dependent from the
EOS and the maximum-mass constraint. Finally, we study how the sound speed and
the conformal anomaly are distributed inside neutron stars and show how these
quantities depend on the imposed maximum-mass constraints.

black hole formation, but simultaneously explaining proximity zone sizes and
black hole masses has proved to be challenging. We study the robustness of some
of the assumptions that are usually made to infer quasar lifetimes from
proximity zone sizes. We show that small proximity zones can be readily
explained by quasars that vary in brightness with a short duty cycle of
$f_\mathrm{duty}\sim 0.1$ and short bright periods of $t_\mathrm{on}\sim 10^4$
yr, even for long lifetimes. We further show that reconciling this with black
hole mass estimates requires the black hole to continue to grow and accrete
during its obscured phase. The consequent obscured fractions of $\gtrsim$ 0.7
or higher are consistent with low-redshift measurements and models of black
hole accretion. Such short duty cycles and long obscured phases are also
consistent with observations of large proximity zones, thus providing a simple,
unified model for proximity zones of all sizes. The large dynamic range of our
simulation, and its calibration to the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, allows us to
investigate the influence of the large-scale topology of reionization and the
quasar's host halo mass on proximity zones. We find that incomplete
reionization can impede the growth of proximity zones and make them smaller up
to 30%, but the quasar host halo mass only affects proximity zones weakly and
indirectly. Our work suggests that high-redshift proximity zones can be an
effective tool to study quasar variability and black hole growth.

appropriate for its operation in realistic rotating stars. The linear growth of
the instability is characterized by a predominantly $m=1$ oscillation with
growth rates roughly following analytical expectations. The non-linear
saturation of the instability appears to be caused by secondary shear
instabilities and is also accompanied by a morphological change of the flow. We
argue, however, that non-linear saturation likely occurs via other mechanisms
in real stars where the separation of scales is larger than those reached by
our simulations. We also observe dynamo action via the amplification of the

annihilation in a density spike. The system serves as a laboratory for
comparing two different dynamical approaches, both of which have been widely

In our Fokker-Planck analysis we extend a previous analytic model to account
for a nonzero flux of DM particles into the BH, as well as a cut-off in the
distribution function near the BH due to relativistic effects or, further out,
possible DM annihilation. In our two-fluid analysis, following an approximate

this energy, upper limits have been reported. Observations or stringent limits
on the DGRB above this energy could have significant multi-messenger
implications, such as constraining the origin of TeV-PeV astrophysical
neutrinos detected by IceCube. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC)
Observatory, located in central Mexico at 4100 m above sea level, is sensitive
to gamma rays from a few hundred GeV to several hundred TeV and continuously
observes a wide field-of-view (2 sr). With its high-energy reach and large area
coverage, HAWC is well-suited to notably improve searches for the DGRB at TeV
energies. In this work, strict cuts have been applied to the HAWC dataset to
better isolate gamma-ray air showers from background hadronic showers. The
sensitivity to the DGRB was then verified using 535 days of Crab data and Monte

the observed circularization in the 150 Myr old M 35 cluster requires that
pre-main sequence stars are much more dissipative: $Q_\star' < 4\times10^4$. We
test for frequency dependence of the tidal dissipation, finding that for tidal
periods between 3 and 7.5 days, if a dependence exists, it is sub-linear for
main-sequence stars. Furthermore, by using a more complete physical model for
the evolution, and by accounting for the particular properties of each system,
we alleviate previously observed tensions in the circularization in the open

in daily communication. Accordingly, there has been much research on political
polarization, including many recent efforts that take a computational
perspective. By detecting political biases in a corpus of text, one can attempt
to describe and discern the polarity of that text. Intuitively, the named
entities (i.e., the nouns and the phrases that act as nouns) and hashtags in
text often carry information about political views. For example, people who use
the term ""pro-choice"" are likely to be liberal, whereas people who use the term
""pro-life"" are likely to be conservative. In this paper, we seek to reveal
political polarities in social-media text data and to quantify these polarities
by explicitly assigning a polarity score to entities and hashtags. Although
this idea is straightforward, it is difficult to perform such inference in a
trustworthy quantitative way. Key challenges include the small number of known
labels, the continuous spectrum of political views, and the preservation of
both a polarity score and a polarity-neutral semantic meaning in an embedding
vector of words. To attempt to overcome these challenges, we propose the
Polarity-aware Embedding Multi-task learning (PEM) model. This model consists
of (1) a self-supervised context-preservation task, (2) an attention-based
tweet-level polarity-inference task, and (3) an adversarial learning task that
promotes independence between an embedding's polarity dimension and its
semantic dimensions. Our experimental results demonstrate that our PEM model
can successfully learn polarity-aware embeddings that perform well
classification tasks. We examine a variety of applications and we thereby
demonstrate the effectiveness of our PEM model. We also discuss important
limitations of our work and encourage caution when applying the it to
real-world scenarios.

such that at least $h$ publications of the user have at least $h$ units of

  We design an algorithm that, given query access to the $n$ publications of a

probability at least $1-\delta$ in time \[

that this bound is in fact asymptotically optimal for this problem in all

  Our work is one of the first in sublinear time algorithms that addresses
obtaining asymptotically optimal bounds, especially in terms of the error and

showcase this, we also use our approach to prove an asymptotically optimal
lower bound for the problem of estimating the number of triangles in a graph in
sublinear time, which now is also optimal in the error and confidence
parameters. This result improves upon prior lower bounds of Eden, Levi, Ron,

the forward-backward asymmetry of charged leptons from the decay of the gauge

qualitative behaviour of the asymmetry depends strongly on the assumptions made

significantly. Consequently, the shape of the asymmetry observed at lower

because of the presence of experimental constraints, is not necessarily
reproduced at large masses where the PDFs are mostly unconstrained by data. It
follows that the shape of the asymmetry at high masses may depend on
assumptions made in the PDF parametrization, and thus deviations from the
traditionally expected behaviour cannot be taken as a reliable indication of
new physics. We demonstrate that forward-backward asymmetry measurements could
help in constraining PDFs at large $x$ and discuss the accuracy that would be
required to disentangle the effects of new physics from uncertainties in the

traditional work comprising structural and linear flow analysis. Such realistic
analysis is expensive, but critical since it can capture cascading failures
that result from transient instabilities introduced due to the attack. Our
model acknowledges the presence of hidden failures in the protection systems

for different levels of hidden failures. Our results show that: ($i$) the power
grid is vulnerable to both these attacks, ($ii$) the tactical attack has
significant social, economic and health damage but need not result in a
regional cascade; on the contrary the targeted attack can cause significant
cascade and lead to power outage over a large region. Our work shows the
necessity to harden the power grid not just to cyber-attacks but also to
physical attacks. Furthermore, we show that realistic representations and
analysis can lead to fundamentally new insights that simplified models are
unlikely to capture. Finally, the methods and results help us identify critical
elements in the grid; the system can then be hardened in a more precise manner

for more than a century, and is now taking on increasing relevance in condensed
matter physics. Recently, electrons were found to become spin polarized after
transmitting through chiral molecules, crystals, and their hybrids. This
phenomenon, called chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), presents broad
application potentials and far-reaching fundamental implications involving
intricate interplays among structural chirality, topological states, and
electronic spin and orbitals. However, the microscopic picture of how chiral
geometry influences electronic spin remains elusive. In this work, via a direct
comparison of magnetoconductance (MC) measurements on magnetic
semiconductor-based chiral molecular spin valves with normal metal electrodes
of contrasting strengths of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we unambiguously
identified the origin of the SOC, a necessity for the CISS effect, given the
negligible SOC in organic molecules. The experiments revealed that a
heavy-metal electrode provides SOC to convert the orbital polarization induced
by the chiral molecular structure to spin polarization. Our results evidence
the essential role of SOC in the metal electrode for engendering the CISS spin
valve effect. A tunneling model with a magnetochiral modulation of the
potential barrier is shown to quantitatively account for the unusual transport
behavior. This work hence produces critical new insights on the microscopic
mechanism of CISS, and more broadly, reveals a fundamental relation between
structure chirality, electron spin, and orbital.

baryon associated with the deformation of the complex structure modulus $b$ of

This deformation was studied to the leading order at small 3-form flux. In this
paper we study the back reaction of the nonzero 3-form flux on the metric and
the dilaton introducing ansatz with several warp factors and solving gravity
equations of motion. We show that 3-form flux produces a potential for the
conifold complex structure modulus $b$, which leads to the runaway vacuum. At
the runaway vacuum warp factors disappear, while the conifold degenerates. In
4D SQCD we relate this to the flow to the U(1) gauge theory upon switching on

particles. We can numerically calculate the pristine TeV CR distribution in the
local ISM with state-of-the-art heliosphere models. Only by subtracting the
heliospheric influence is it possible to use TeV CR observations to infer

be revolutionary. The wave-like nature opens special opportunities to gain

information on dark matter shortly after a first detection. To achieve these
goals requires continued strong support for the next generations of axion
experiments to probe significant axion parameter space this decade and to
realize the vision of a definitive axion search program in the next 20 years.
This needs to be complemented by strong and flexible support for a broad range
of smaller experiments, sensitive to the full variety of wave-like dark matter
candidates. These have their own discovery potential but can also be the test
bed for future larger scale searches. Strong technological support not only
allows for the optimal realization of the current and near future experiments

the next evolutionary jump enabling a broader and deeper sensitivity. Finally,
a theory effort ranging from fundamental model building over investigating

Deep Learning methods have been proposed for automatic tooth segmentation from
3D dental models or intraoral scans. These methods require annotated 3D
intraoral scans. Manually annotating 3D intraoral scans is a laborious task.
One approach is to devise self-supervision methods to reduce the manual
labeling effort. Compared to other types of point cloud data like scene point
cloud or shape point cloud data, 3D tooth point cloud data has a very regular
structure and a strong shape prior. We look at how much representative
information can be learnt from a single 3D intraoral scan. We evaluate this
quantitatively with the help of ten different methods of which six are generic
point cloud segmentation methods whereas the other four are tooth segmentation
specific methods. Surprisingly, we find that with a single 3D intraoral scan
training, the Dice score can be as high as 0.86 whereas the full training set
gives Dice score of 0.94. We conclude that the segmentation methods can learn a
great deal of information from a single 3D tooth point cloud scan under
suitable conditions e.g. data augmentation. We are the first to quantitatively
evaluate and demonstrate the representation learning capability of Deep
Learning methods from a single 3D intraoral scan. This can enable building
self-supervision methods for tooth segmentation under extreme data limitation

However, this can change dramatically when 180{\deg} domain walls are present,
as they are often found to be strongly conducting. Absolute conductivities
depend on the inclination angles of the walls with respect to the [001]
polarisation axis and so, if these inclination angles can be altered, then
electrical conductivities can be tuned, or even toggled on and off. In 500nm
thick z-cut ion-sliced thin films, localised wall angle variations can be
controlled by both the sense and magnitude of applied electrical bias. We show
that this results in a diode-like charge transport response which is effective
for half-wave rectification, albeit only at relatively low ac frequencies. Most
importantly, however, we also demonstrate that such domain wall diodes can be
used to construct ""AND"" and inclusive ""OR"" logic gates, where ""0"" and ""1""
output states are clearly distinguishable. Realistic device modelling allows an
extrapolation of results for the operation of these domain wall diodes in more
complex arrangements and, although non-ideal, output states can still be

averaging algorithm to compute refinable vector functions for wavelet methods
in numerical PDEs and to produce smooth curves in CAGD. In sharp contrast to
the well-studied scalar subdivision schemes, vector subdivision schemes are
much less well understood, e.g., Lagrange and (generalized) Hermite subdivision
schemes are the only studied vector subdivision schemes in the literature.
Because many wavelets used in numerical PDEs are derived from refinable vector
functions whose matrix masks are not from Hermite subdivision schemes, it is
necessary to introduce and study vector subdivision schemes for any general
matrix masks in order to compute wavelets and refinable vector functions
efficiently. For a general matrix mask, we show that there is only one
meaningful way of defining a vector subdivision scheme. Motivated by vector
cascade algorithms and recent study on Hermite subdivision schemes, we shall
define a vector subdivision scheme for any arbitrary matrix mask and then we
prove that the convergence of the newly defined vector subdivision scheme is
equivalent to the convergence of its associated vector cascade algorithm. We
also study convergence rates of vector subdivision schemes. The results of this
paper not only bridge the gaps and establish intrinsic links between vector
subdivision schemes and vector cascade algorithms but also strengthen and
generalize current known results on Lagrange and (generalized) Hermite
subdivision schemes. Several examples are provided to illustrate the results in
this paper on various types of vector subdivision schemes with convergence

  characteristic","32 pages, few misprints corrected and remark added",,,,"math.CO math.AC math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Much of the fascinating numerology surrounding finite reflection groups stems
from Solomon's celebrated 1963 theorem describing invariant differential forms.
Invariant differential derivations also exhibit interesting numerology over the
complex numbers. We explore the analogous theory over arbitrary fields, in
particular, when the characteristic of the underlying field divides the order
of the acting reflection group and the conclusion of Solomon's Theorem may
fail. Using results of Broer and Chuai, we give a Saito criterion (Jacobian
criterion) for finding a basis of differential derivations invariant under a
finite group that distinguishes certain cases over fields of characteristic 2.
We show that the reflecting hyperplanes lie in a single orbit and demonstrate a
duality of exponents and coexponents when the transvection root spaces of a
reflection group are maximal. A set of basic derivations are used to construct
a basis of invariant differential derivations with a twisted wedging in this
case. We obtain explicit bases for the special linear groups SL(n,q) and
general linear groups GL(n,q), and all groups in between.

appreciate and exploit the presence of extragalactic objects in the field of
view, the Aladin sky atlas and NED were employed to make a rudimentary census
of extragalactic objects that were serendipitously observed with the 100-m
Greenbank telescope observing at 1.1-1.9 GHz. For 469 target fields (assuming a
FWHM radial field-of-view of 4.2 arcminutes), NED identified a grand total of
143024 extragalactic objects, including various astrophysical exotica e.g. AGN
of various types, radio galaxies, interacting galaxies, and one confirmed
gravitational lens system. Several nearby galaxies, galaxy groups and galaxy
clusters are identified, permitting the parameter space probed by SETI surveys
to be significantly extended. Constraints are placed on the luminosity function
of potential extraterrestrial transmitters assuming it follows a simple power
law and limits on the prevalence of very powerful extraterrestrial transmitters
associated with these vast stellar systems are also determined. It is
demonstrated that the recent Breakthrough Listen Initiative, and indeed many
previous SETI radio surveys, place stronger limits on the prevalence of
extraterrestrial intelligence in the distant Universe than is often fully

the cost and time to build these detectors is currently large. Therefore,
advancements in the fundamental technology of tracking detectors may need to
look at a more transformative approach that enables extremely large area
coverage with minimal dead material and is easier and faster to build. The
advancement of thin film fabrication techniques has the potential to
revolutionize the next-to-next generation of particle detector experiments.
Some thin film deposition techniques have already been developed and widely
used in the industry to make LED screens for TV's and monitors. If large area
thin film detectors on the order of several square meters can be fabricated
with similar performance as current silicon technologies, they could be used in

on sorted uniforms and, consequently, can suffer from the confounded effect of
different locations and various signal frequencies in the deviations of the
distributions under the alternative hypothesis from those under the null. This
paper proposes circularly symmetric tests that are obtained by circularizing
reweighted Anderson-Darling tests, with the focus on the circularized versions
of Anderson-Darling and Zhang test statistics. Two specific types of
circularization are considered, one is obtained by taking the average of the
corresponding so-called scan test statistics and the other by using the
maximum. To a certain extent, this circularization technique effectively
eliminates the location effect and allows the weights to focus on the various
signal frequencies. A limited but arguably convincing simulation study on
finite-sample performance demonstrates that the circularized Zhang method
outperforms the circularized Anderson-Darling and that the circularized tests
outperform their parent methods. Large-sample theoretical results are also
obtained for the average type of circularization. The results show that both
the circularized Anderson-Darling and circularized Zhang have asymptotic
distributions that are a weighted sum of an infinite number of independent
squared standard normal random variables. In addition, the kernel matrices and
functions are circulant. As a result, asymptotic approximations are
computationally efficient via the fast Fourier transform.

experiments. For two competing population models, the Bayes factor reflects the
relative likelihood of observing some data under one model compared to the
other. In general, computing a Bayes factor is difficult, because computing the
marginal likelihood of each model requires integrating the product of the
likelihood and a prior distribution on the population parameter(s). In this
paper, we develop a new analytic formula for computing Bayes factors directly
from minimal summary statistics in repeated-measures designs. This work is an
improvement on previous methods for computing Bayes factors from summary
statistics (e.g., the BIC method), which produce Bayes factors that violate the
Sellke upper bound of evidence for smaller sample sizes. The new approach taken
in this paper extends requires knowing only the $F$-statistic and degrees of
freedom, both of which are commonly reported in most empirical work. In
addition to providing computational examples, we report a simulation study that
benchmarks the new formula against other methods for computing Bayes factors in

The few existing studies on this topic rather focus on specific attributes of
quality that can be easily quantified and measured. Existing techniques and
corresponding tools may also focus on comments bound to a specific programming
language, and may only deal with comments with specific scopes and clear goals
(e.g., Javadoc comments at the method level, or in-body comments describing

research questions: (i) What types of comments do researchers focus on when
assessing comment quality? (ii) What quality attributes (QAs) do they consider?
(iii) Which tools and techniques do they use to assess comment quality?, and
(iv) How do they evaluate their studies on comment quality assessment in
general? Our evaluation, based on the analysis of 2353 papers and the actual
review of 47 relevant ones, shows that (i) most studies and techniques focus on
comments in Java code, thus may not be generalizable to other languages, and
(ii) the analyzed studies focus on four main QAs of a total of 21 QAs
identified in the literature, with a clear predominance of checking consistency
between comments and the code. We observe that researchers rely on manual
assessment and specific heuristics rather than the automated assessment of the

importance in many applications. A well-known strategy to design such devices
is multi-scale topology optimization (MTO), where optimal microstructures are
designed within each cell of a discretized domain. Unfortunately, MTO is
computationally very expensive since one must perform homogenization of the
evolving microstructures, during each step of the homogenization process. As an
alternate, we propose here a graded multiscale topology optimization (GMTO) for
designing fluid-flow devices. In the proposed method, several pre-selected but
size-parameterized and orientable microstructures are used to fill the domain
optimally. GMTO significantly reduces the computation while retaining many of
the benefits of MTO.
  In particular, GMTO is implemented here using a neural-network (NN) since:
(1) homogenization can be performed off-line, and used by the NN during
optimization, (2) it enables continuous switching between microstructures
during optimization, (3) the number of design variables and computational
effort is independent of number of microstructure used, and, (4) it supports
automatic differentiation, thereby eliminating manual sensitivity analysis.
Several numerical results are presented to illustrate the proposed framework.

building protein structures from cryo-EM density maps, analyze their impact,
and discuss the challenges of preparing high-quality data sets for training

  Robust Loss",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Recent advances in deep learning algorithms have led to significant benefits
for solving many medical image analysis problems. Training deep learning models
commonly requires large datasets with expert-labeled annotations. However,
acquiring expert-labeled annotation is not only expensive but also is
subjective, error-prone, and inter-/intra- observer variability introduces
noise to labels. This is particularly a problem when using deep learning models
for segmenting medical images due to the ambiguous anatomical boundaries.
Image-based medical diagnosis tools using deep learning models trained with
incorrect segmentation labels can lead to false diagnoses and treatment
suggestions. Multi-rater annotations might be better suited to train deep
learning models with small training sets compared to single-rater annotations.
The aim of this paper was to develop and evaluate a method to generate
probabilistic labels based on multi-rater annotations and anatomical knowledge
of the lesion features in MRI and a method to train segmentation models using
probabilistic labels using normalized active-passive loss as a ""noise-tolerant
loss"" function. The model was evaluated by comparing it to binary ground truth
for 17 knees MRI scans for clinical segmentation and detection of bone marrow
lesions (BML). The proposed method successfully improved precision 14, recall
22, and Dice score 8 percent compared to a binary cross-entropy loss function.
Overall, the results of this work suggest that the proposed normalized
active-passive loss using soft labels successfully mitigated the effects of
noisy labels.

constructed a general candidate for the local Langlands correspondence, via a
geometric Langlands correspondence occurring over the Fargues-Fontaine curve.
We carry some of the theory of geometric Eisenstein series over to the
Fargues-Fontaine setting. Namely, given a quasi-split connected reductive group
$G/\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ with simply connected derived group and maximal torus $T$,
we construct an Eisenstein functor $\mathrm{nEis}(-)$, which takes sheaves on
$Bun_{T}$ to sheaves on $Bun_{G}$. We show that, given a sufficiently nice
$L$-parameter $\phi_{T}: W_{\mathbb{Q}_{p}} \rightarrow \phantom{}^{L}T$, there
is a Hecke eigensheaf on $Bun_{G}$ with eigenvalue $\phi$, given by applying
$\mathrm{nEis}(-)$ to the Hecke eigensheaf $\mathcal{S}_{\phi_{T}}$ on
$Bun_{T}$ attached to $\phi_{T}$ by Fargues and Zou. We show that
$\mathrm{nEis}(\mathcal{S}_{\phi_{T}})$ interacts well with Verdier duality,
and, assuming compatibility of the Fargues-Scholze correspondence with a
suitably nice form of the local Langlands correspondence, provide an explicit
formula for the stalks of the eigensheaf in terms of parabolic inductions of
the character $\chi$ attached to $\phi_{T}$. This has several surprising
consequences. First, it recovers special cases of an averaging formula of Shin
for the cohomology of local Shimura varieties with rational coefficients, and
generalizes it to the non-minuscule case. Second, it refines the averaging
formula in the cases where the parameter $\phi$ is sufficiently nice, giving an
explicit formula for the degrees of cohomology that certain parabolic
inductions sit in, and this refined formula holds even with torsion

model of the Sun. This dynamo model has been extensively studied in a
two-dimensional (2D) mean-field framework in both kinematic and non-kinematic
regimes. Recent three-dimensional (3D) models have been restricted to the
kinematic regime. In these models, the surface poloidal flux is produced by the
emergence of bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) that are tilted according to Joy's
law. We investigate the prescription for emergence of a BMR in 3D non-kinematic
simulations. We also report initial results of cyclic BL dynamo simulation. We
extend a conventional 2D mean-field model of the BL flux-transport dynamo into
3D non-kinematic regime. The large-scale mean flows are driven by the
parameterized $\Lambda$-effect in this model. For the induction equation, we
use a BL source term by which the surface BMRs are produced in response to the
dynamo-generated toroidal field inside the convection zone. We find that, in
the 3D non-kinematic regime, the tilt angle of a newly-emerged BMR is very
sensitive to the prescription for the subsurface structure of the BMR. Anti-Joy
tilt angles are found unless the BMR is deeply embedded in the convection zone.
We also find that the leading spot tends to become stronger than the following
spot. The anti-Joy's law trend and the morphological asymmetry of the BMRs can
be explained by the Coriolis force acting on the Lorentz-force-driven flows.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the solar-like magnetic cycles can be
successfully obtained if the Joy's law is explicitly given in the BL
$\alpha$-effect. In these cyclic dynamo simulation, a strong Lorentz force
feedback leads to cycle modulations in the differential rotation and meridional
circulation. The non-axisymmetric components of the flows are found to exist as
inertial modes such as the equatorial Rossby modes.

representing the graph as the 1-skeleton of a cell complex introduced to
capture higher order interactions. In particular, we exploit the lower and
upper neighborhoods, as encoded in the cell complex, to design two independent

attention strategy. The approach used in CANs is hierarchical and it
incorporates the following steps: i) a lifting algorithm that learns {\it edge
features} from {\it node features}; ii) a cell attention mechanism to find the
optimal combination of edge features over both lower and upper neighbors; iii)
a hierarchical {\it edge pooling} mechanism to extract a compact meaningful set
of features. The experimental results show that CAN is a low complexity

automatically tune the neighborhood size of a proposal distribution in a

large device resistance in the read path (RS) due to low mobility of WSe2 and
Schottky contacts deteriorates sense margin, offsetting the benefits of
VSH-MRAM. To address this limitation, we propose another flavor of VSH-based
MRAM that (while inheriting most of the benefits of VSH-MRAM) achieves lower RS

is enabled by coupling VSH with electrically-isolated but magnetically-coupled
PMA magnets via interlayer exchange-coupling. Designing the proposed devices

maintain a compact memory footprint, we share the read access transistor across

1.1X-1.3X larger sense margin at a comparable area. This comes at the cost of

registration at full resolution can yield a superior registration quality --
but not always. For example, downsampling a synthetic image from $1024^3$ to
$256^3$ decreases the Dice coefficient from 92% to 79%. However, the
differences are less pronounced for noisy or low-contrast high-resolution
images. CLAIRE allows us not only to register images of clinically relevant
size in a few seconds but also to register images at unprecedented resolution
in a reasonable time. The highest resolution considered is CLARITY images of
size $2816\times3016\times1162$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study on image registration quality at such resolutions.

partially unsolved. Comprehensive data regarding pressure-dependent changes of
the attenuation and sound speed of a bubbly medium are not available. Our
theoretical understanding of the problem is limited to linear or semi-linear
theoretical models, which are not accurate in the regime of large amplitude
bubble oscillations. Here, by controlling the size of the lipid coated bubbles
(mean diameter of ~5.4um), we report the first time observation and
characterization of the simultaneous pressure dependence of sound speed and
attenuation in bubbly water below, at and above MBs resonance (frequency range
between 1-3MHz). With increasing acoustic pressure (between 12.5-100kPa), the
frequency of the attenuation and sound speed peaks decreases while maximum and
minimum amplitudes of the sound speed increase. We propose a nonlinear model
for the estimation of the pressure dependent sound speed and attenuation with
good agreement with the experiments. The model calculations are validated by
comparing with the linear and semi-linear models predictions. One of the major
challenges of the previously developed models is the significant overestimation
of the attenuation at the bubble resonance at higher void fractions (e.g.
0.005). We addressed this problem by incorporating bubble-bubble interactions
and comparing the results to experiments. Influence of the bubble-bubble
interactions increases with increasing pressure. Within the examined exposure
parameters, we numerically show that, even for low void fractions (e.g.
5.1*10-6) with increasing pressure the sound speed may become 4 times higher
than the sound speed in the non-bubbly medium.

different effects on the shadows, such as non-monotonic properties and
intersection phenomena mentioned in this work. Using these characteristics, it
is possible to test the no-hair theorem in future EHT observations, so as to

a rich and surprising Landau spectrum measured in twisted bilayer graphene away
from the magic angle. Suspecting that such anisotropy could arise from
unintended uniaxial strain, we extend the Bistritzer-MacDonald model to include
uniaxial heterostrain. We find that such strain strongly influences band
structure, shifting the three otherwise-degenerate van Hove points to different
energies. Coupled to a Boltzmann magnetotransport calculation, this reproduces
previously-unexplained non-saturating $B^2$ magnetoresistance over broad ranges
of density near filling $\nu=\pm 2$, and predicts subtler features that had not
been noticed in the experimental data. In contrast to these distinctive
signatures in longitudinal resistivity, the Hall coefficient is barely
influenced by strain, to the extent that it still shows a single sign change on
each side of the charge neutrality point -- surprisingly, this sign change no
longer occurs at a van Hove point. The theory also predicts a marked rotation
of the electrical transport principal axes as a function of filling even for
fixed strain and for rigid bands. More careful examination of
interaction-induced nematic order versus strain effects in twisted bilayer
graphene could thus be in order.

added adapter is still easy to disregard the knowledge of the PLM especially
for few-shot natural language generation (NLG) since an entire sequence is

we develop a novel additive learning algorithm based on reinforcement learning
(RL) that selectively outputs language tokens between the task-general PLM and
the task-specific adapter during both training and inference. This output token
selection over the two generators allows the adapter to take into account
solely the task-relevant parts in sequence generation, and therefore makes it
more robust to overfitting as well as more stable in RL training. In addition,
to obtain the complementary adapter from the PLM for each few-shot task, we
exploit a separate selecting module that is also simultaneously trained using
RL. Experimental results on various few-shot NLG tasks including question

local field potential (LFP) features that responded to KT leave extracts and AD
flu. The features that responded to KT syrup had the highest similarity to
those that responded to the AD flu at 85.62 $\pm$ 0.29%. This finding presents
the higher feasibility of using KT syrup as an alternative substance for
depressant therapy than KT alkaloids and KT aqueous, which are the other
candidates in this study. Apart from the similarity measurement, we utilized
ANet as a multi-task AE and evaluated the performance in discriminating
multi-class LFP responses corresponding to the effect of different KT extracts
and AD flu simultaneously. Furthermore, we visualized learned latent features
among LFP responses qualitatively and quantitatively as t-SNE projection and
maximum mean discrepancy distance, respectively. The classification results
reported the accuracy and F1-score of 79.78 $\pm$ 0.39% and 79.53 $\pm$ 0.00%.
In summary, the outcomes of this research might help therapeutic design devices
for an alternative substance profile evaluation, such as Kratom-based form in
real-world applications.

30000-100000 over infrared wavelengths covered by JWST (2.9-12.8 $\mu$m). Two
new surveys with iSHELL and VISIR are combined with previous spectra from
CRIRES and TEXES to cover parts of multiple ro-vibrational and rotational bands
observable within telluric transmission bands, for a total of $\approx160$
spectra and 85 disks (30 of which are JWST targets in Cycle 1). The general
expectation of a range of regions and excitation conditions traced by infrared
water spectra is for the first time supported by the combined kinematics and
excitation as spectrally resolved at multiple wavelengths. The main findings
from this analysis are: 1) water lines are progressively narrower from the
ro-vibrational bands at 2-9 $\mu$m to the rotational lines at 12 $\mu$m, and
partly match a broad (BC) and narrow (NC) emission components, respectively, as
extracted from ro-vibrational CO spectra; 2) rotation diagrams of resolved
water lines from upper level energies of 4000-9500 K show vertical spread and
curvatures indicative of optically thick emission ($\approx 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$)
from a range of excitation temperatures ($\approx 800$-1100 K); 3) the new 5
$\mu$m spectra demonstrate that slab model fits to the rotational lines at $>

methods, where the critical bottleneck is identified as how to fulfill the
high-frequency structure and low-frequency texture information on the masked
regions with semantics. To this end, deep models exhibit powerful superiority
to capture them, yet constrained on the local spatial regions. In this paper,
we delve globally into texture and structure information to well capture the
semantics for image inpainting. As opposed to the existing arts trapped on the
independent local patches, the texture information of each patch is
reconstructed from all other patches across the whole image, to match the
coarsely filled information, specially the structure information over the
masked regions. Unlike the current decoder-only transformer within the pixel
level for image inpainting, our model adopts the transformer pipeline paired
with both encoder and decoder. On one hand, the encoder captures the texture
semantic correlations of all patches across image via self-attention module. On
the other hand, an adaptive patch vocabulary is dynamically established in the
decoder for the filled patches over the masked regions. Building on this, a
structure-texture matching attention module anchored on the known regions comes
up to marry the best of these two worlds for progressive inpainting via a
probabilistic diffusion process. Our model is orthogonal to the fashionable
arts, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Attention and Transformer
model, from the perspective of texture and structure information for image
inpainting. The extensive experiments over the benchmarks validate its
superiority. Our code is available at

achieving these properties include the generalized Ohm's law for electric field
such that the asymptotic-preserving discretization can be achieved, and a
proper decomposition of the effects of the electromagnetic fields such that a
Lagrange multiplier method can be appropriately employed for correcting the

  for Electric Vehicle AMoD Systems","8 pages",,,,"cs.MA cs.LG cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electric vehicles (EVs) play critical roles in autonomous mobility-on-demand
(AMoD) systems, but their unique charging patterns increase the model
uncertainties in AMoD systems (e.g. state transition probability). Since there
usually exists a mismatch between the training and test (true) environments,
incorporating model uncertainty into system design is of critical importance in
real-world applications. However, model uncertainties have not been considered
explicitly in EV AMoD system rebalancing by existing literature yet and remain
an urgent and challenging task. In this work, we design a robust and
constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework with transition
kernel uncertainty for the EV rebalancing and charging problem. We then propose
a robust and constrained MARL algorithm (ROCOMA) that trains a robust EV
rebalancing policy to balance the supply-demand ratio and the charging
utilization rate across the whole city under state transition uncertainty.
Experiments show that the ROCOMA can learn an effective and robust rebalancing
policy. It outperforms non-robust MARL methods when there are model
uncertainties. It increases the system fairness by 19.6% and decreases the
rebalancing costs by 75.8%.

achieved promising results on some evaluation metrics (e.g., CIDEr). However,
recent findings show that the captions generated by these methods tend to be
biased toward the ""average"" caption that only captures the most general mode
(a.k.a, language pattern) in the training corpus, i.e., the so-called mode
collapse problem. Affected by it, the generated captions are limited in
diversity and usually less informative than natural image descriptions made by
humans. In this paper, we seek to avoid this problem by proposing a Discrete
Mode Learning (DML) paradigm for image captioning. Our innovative idea is to
explore the rich modes in the training caption corpus to learn a set of ""mode
embeddings"", and further use them to control the mode of the generated captions
for existing image captioning models. Specifically, the proposed DML optimizes
a dual architecture that consists of an image-conditioned discrete variational
autoencoder (CdVAE) branch and a mode-conditioned image captioning (MIC)
branch. The CdVAE branch maps each image caption to one of the mode embeddings
stored in a learned codebook, and is trained with a pure non-autoregressive
generation objective to make the modes distinct and representative. The MIC
branch can be simply modified from an existing image captioning model, where
the mode embedding is added to the original word embeddings as the control
signal. In the experiments, we apply the proposed DML to two widely used image
captioning models, Transformer and AoANet. The results show that the learned
mode embedding successfully facilitates these models to generate high-quality
image captions with different modes, further leading to better performance for
both diversity and quality on the MSCOCO dataset.

general global-local spatial selection prior that extends a rich class of
well-studied selection priors. Unlike existing constructions, we achieve
simultaneous global (i.e, at covariate-level) and local (i.e., at
pixel/voxel-level) selection by introducing `participation rate' parameters
that measure the probability for the individual covariates to affect the
observed images. This along with a hard-thresholding strategy leads to
dependency between selections at the two levels, introduces extra sparsity at
the local level, and allows the global selection to be informed by the local
selection, all in a model-based manner. We design an efficient Gibbs sampler
that allows inference for large image data. We show on simulated data that
parameters are interpretable and lead to efficient selection. Finally, we
demonstrate performance of the proposed model by using data from the Autism

detection accuracy and computational cost of object detection depend on the
spatial resolution of an image, which may be constrained by both the camera and
storage considerations. Compression is often achieved by reducing either
spatial or amplitude resolution or, at times, both, both of which have
well-known effects on performance. Detection accuracy also depends on the
distance of the object of interest from the camera. Our work examines the
impact of spatial and amplitude resolution, as well as object distance, on
object detection accuracy and computational cost. We develop a
resolution-adaptive variant of YOLOv5 (RA-YOLO), which varies the number of
scales in the feature pyramid and detection head based on the spatial
resolution of the input image. To train and evaluate this new method, we
created a dataset of images with diverse spatial and amplitude resolutions by
combining images from the TJU and Eurocity datasets and generating different
resolutions by applying spatial resizing and compression. We first show that
RA-YOLO achieves a good trade-off between detection accuracy and inference time
over a large range of spatial resolutions. We then evaluate the impact of
spatial and amplitude resolutions on object detection accuracy using the
proposed RA-YOLO model. We demonstrate that the optimal spatial resolution that
leads to the highest detection accuracy depends on the 'tolerated' image size.
We further assess the impact of the distance of an object to the camera on the
detection accuracy and show that higher spatial resolution enables a greater
detection range. These results provide important guidelines for choosing the
image spatial resolution and compression settings predicated on available
bandwidth, storage, desired inference time, and/or desired detection range, in
practical applications.

requirement of high thermoreflectance coefficient restricts the choice of metal
coating and laser wavelength. The accuracy of the measurement is often limited
by the high sensitivity to the radii of the laser beams. We describe an
alternative frequency-domain pump-probe technique based on probe beam
deflection. The beam deflection is primarily caused by thermoelastic
deformation of the sample surface with a magnitude determined by the thermal
expansion coefficient of the bulk material to measure. We derive an analytical
solution to the coupled elasticity and heat diffusion equations for periodic
heating of a multilayer sample with anisotropic elastic constants, thermal
conductivity, and thermal expansion coefficients. In most cases, a simplified
model can reliably describe the frequency dependence of the beam deflection
signal without knowledge of the elastic constants and thermal expansion
coefficients of the material. The magnitude of the probe beam deflection signal
is larger than the maximum magnitude achievable by thermoreflectance detection
of surface temperatures if the thermal expansion coefficient is greater than
5x10^(-6) /K. The sensitivity to laser beam radii is suppressed when a larger
beam offset is used. We find nearly perfect matching of the measured signal and

as compressed sensing, variable selection in regression problems, and recently
neural network compression in machine learning. For example, the problem of
compressing a neural network is a bi-level, stochastic, and nonconvex problem
that can be cast into a sparse optimization problem. Hence, developing
efficient methods for sparse optimization plays a critical role in
applications. The goal of this paper is to develop analytical techniques for
general, large size sparse optimization problems using the hard thresholding
operator. To this end, we study the iterative hard thresholding (IHT)
algorithm, which has been extensively studied in the literature because it is
scalable, fast, and easily implementable. In spite of extensive research on the
IHT scheme, we develop several new techniques that not only recover many known
results but also lead to new results. Specifically, we first establish a new
and critical gradient descent property of the hard thresholding (HT) operator.
Our gradient descent result can be related to the distance between points that
are sparse. Also, our gradient descent property allows one to study the IHT
when the stepsize is less than or equal to 1/L, where L>0 is the Lipschitz
constant of the gradient of an objective function. Note that the existing
techniques in the literature can only handle the case when the stepsize is
strictly less than 1/L. By exploiting this we introduce and study HT-stable and
HT-unstable stationary points and show no matter how close an initialization is
to a HT-unstable stationary point (saddle point in sparse sense), the IHT
sequence leaves it. Finally, we show that no matter what sparse initial point
is selected, the IHT sequence converges if the function values at HT-stable
stationary points are distinct.

drives scattered light emission at non-conventional directions, leading to
scarce and complex experimental observations. Direct-irradiation campaigns at
the SG-II UP facility have measured the scattered light driven by SRSS over a
wide range of angles. It indicated an emission at large polar angles over a
broad azimuthal range, sensitive to the plasma profile and laser polarization,
resulting in a loss of about 5\% of the total laser energy. Direct comparison
with back-scattering measurement has evidenced SRSS as the dominant Raman
scattering process. The predominance of SRSS was confirmed by 2D
particle-in-cell simulations, and its angular spread has been corroborated by
ray-tracing simulations. The main implication is that a complete
characterization of the SRS instability and an accurate measurement of the
energy losses require the collection of the scattered light in a broad range of
directions. Otherwise, spatially limited measurement could lead to an
underestimation of the energetic importance of stimulated Raman scattering.

hoping that the model can generalize well to unseen target domains. The
distribution shift between domains contains the covariate shift and conditional
shift, both of which the model must be able to handle for better
generalizability. In this paper, a novel DG method is proposed to deal with the
distribution shift via Visual Alignment and Uncertainty-guided belief Ensemble
(VAUE). Specifically, for the covariate shift, a visual alignment module is
designed to align the distribution of image style to a common empirical
Gaussian distribution so that the covariate shift can be eliminated in the
visual space. For the conditional shift, we adopt an uncertainty-guided belief
ensemble strategy based on the subjective logic and Dempster-Shafer theory. The
conditional distribution given a test sample is estimated by the dynamic
combination of that of source domains. Comprehensive experiments are conducted
to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method on four widely

significantly reduce the times slots used for data synchronization compared

combines a synthetic diffusion-based label generator with a semantic image

occupancy voxel map to generate potential dynamic obstacle regions as
proposals. With the obstacle region proposals, the Kalman filter and our
continuity filter are applied to track each dynamic obstacle. Finally, the
environment-aware trajectory prediction method is proposed based on the Markov
chain using the states of tracked dynamic obstacles. We implemented the

simulation and physical experiments show that our methods can successfully
track and represent obstacles in dynamic environments in real-time and safely

magnetic refrigeration and calorimetric experiments at sub-millikevin (sub-mK)
temperatures. The specific application here is an adiabatic demagnetization
refrigerator with two PrNi$_{5}$ nuclear stages, which can keep a temperature
of 0.8 mK continuously, (CNDR) proposed by Toda et al. (J. Phys.: Conf. Ser.
969, 012093 (2018). The switch consists of six high-purity zinc foils of 0.25
mm thick which contact seven silver foils by diffusive bonding. The silver
foils are electron beam welded to silver rods that are thermal links to other
components. The choice of the thin zinc foils is due to reduce the magnetic
latent heat on switching and the contact thermal resistance under a constraint
on the aspect ratio of the switch element. The measured thermal conductance of
the whole switch assembly in the normal (closed) state, $K_\mathrm{closed}$,
agrees very well down to 70 mK with the value estimated from the residual
electrical resistance 114 n$\mathrm{\Omega}$ at 4.2 K, indicating the validity
of the Wiedemann-Franz law for zinc. The measured thermal conductance in the
superconducting (open) state, $K_\mathrm{open}$, follows nicely the prediction
from the BCS theory and approaches the value expected from the Debye model for
thermal phonons near 70 mK. The heat leak through the HSW from the higher
temperature side of 30 mK at most is estimated to be less than 0.5 nW, which is
much lower than the expected cooling power ($= 10$ nW) of the CNDR at 0.8 mK .
The switching ratio $K_\mathrm{closed}/K_\mathrm{open}$ extrapolated to 30 mK,
is as high as 5$\times10^4$. All the test results meet the requirements for the
CNDR and, for example, heat capacity measurements at sub-mK.

scalable 3D instance segmentation. Existing state-of-the-art methods produce
hard semantic predictions followed by grouping to obtain instance segmentation
results. However, the errors stemming from hard decisions propagate into
grouping that results in low overlaps of the predicted instances with the
ground truth and substantial false positives. To address the aforementioned
problems, SoftGroup allows each point to be associated with multiple classes to
mitigate the problem stemming from semantic prediction errors and suppresses
false positive instances by learning to categorize them as background.
Regarding scalability, the existing fast methods require computational time on
the order of tens of seconds on large-scale scenes, which is unsatisfactory and
far from applicable for real-time. Our finding is that the $k$-Nearest Neighbor
($k$-NN) module, which serves as the prerequisite of grouping, introduces
computational bottleneck. SoftGroup is extended to resolve this computational
bottleneck, which is referred to as SoftGroup++. The proposed SoftGroup++
reduces time complexity with octree $k$-NN and reduces search space with
class-aware pyramid scaling and late devoxelization. Experimental results on
various indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate the efficacy and generality of
the proposed SoftGroup and SoftGroup++. Their performances surpass the
strongest baseline by a large margin (6\% $\sim$ 16\%) in terms of AP$_{50}$.
On datasets with large-scale scenes, SoftGroup++ achieves 6$\times$ speed boost

researchers turn their attention to designing GNNs for heterophily graphs by
adjusting the message passing mechanism or enlarging the receptive field of the

heterophily from model design perspective, we propose to study heterophily
graphs from an orthogonal perspective by rewiring the graph structure to reduce
heterophily and making the traditional GNNs perform better. Through
comprehensive empirical studies and analysis, we verify the potential of the
rewiring methods. To fully exploit its potential, we propose a method named
Deep Heterophily Graph Rewiring (DHGR) to rewire graphs by adding homophilic
edges and pruning heterophilic edges. The detailed way of rewiring is
determined by comparing the similarity of label/feature-distribution of node
neighbors. Besides, we design a scalable implementation for DHGR to guarantee
high efficiency. DHRG can be easily used as a plug-in module, i.e., a graph
pre-processing step, for any GNNs, including both GNN for homophily and
heterophily, to boost their performance on the node classification task. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first work studying graph rewiring for
heterophily graphs. Extensive experiments on 11 public graph datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods.

patterns transit definitely over generations, so cooperators and defectors
persist definitely. This framework can be extended to explore games including
the snowdrift game, the public goods games (with or without loner, punishment),

commonly applied to calcium imaging data to estimate functional neuronal

Graph Quilting problem, as first introduced by (Vinci et.al. 2019), in which
the goal is to infer the structure of the full graph when only subsets of

address the challenges brought by the block-wise missingness and are the first
to investigate the problem in the context of graph learning. We discuss
theoretical properties of the two-step procedure, showing graph selection
consistency of one proposed approach by proving novel L infinity-norm error

bursts are detected during the {\it AstroSat} observations. During the bursts,
hard X-rays increased unlike previous observations where a reduction in hard
X-rays is observed during the bursts. Decrease in the electron temperature and

sparsely and irregularly distributed points. The MPSOs combination is guided by
the least square error metric to derive weighting coefficients on the fly to

outputs the corresponding micro-image's RGB values. Light field encoding in

been performed. The effects of the assumptions of the theory on the compression
process have been explored, and the detailed profiles of the FRC during
compression have been investigated. The pressure evolution agrees with the
theoretical prediction under various initial conditions. The axial contraction
of the FRC can be affected by the initial density profile and the ramping rate
of the compression magnetic field, but the theoretical predictions on the FRC's
length in general and the relation $r_s=\sqrt{2}r_o$ in particular hold
approximately well during the whole compression process, where $r_s$ is the
major radius of FRC separatrix and $r_o$ is that of the magnetic axis. The
evolutions of the density and temperature can be affected significantly by the
initial equilibrium profile and the ramping rate of the compression magnetic
field. During the compression, the major radius of the FRC is another parameter
that is susceptible to the ramping rate of the compression field. Basically,
for the same magnetic compression ratio, the peak density is higher and the
FRC's radius $r_s$ is smaller than the theoretical predictions.

its self-supervised training, GedankenNet successfully generalized to

self-supervised learning achieved complex-valued image reconstructions that are
consistent with the Maxwell's equations, meaning that its output inference and

considerable attention. However, very few researches address the issue of
emotional editing of these talking face videos with continuously controllable

speech-related expressions and emotion-related expressions are often highly
coupled. Meanwhile, traditional image-to-image translation methods cannot work
well in our application due to the coupling of expressions with other
attributes such as poses, i.e., translating the expression of the character in
each frame may simultaneously change the head pose due to the bias of the
training data distribution. In this paper, we propose a high-quality facial
expression editing method for talking face videos, allowing the user to control
the target emotion in the edited video continuously. We present a new
perspective for this task as a special case of motion information editing,
where we use a 3DMM to capture major facial movements and an associated texture
map modeled by a StyleGAN to capture appearance details. Both representations
(3DMM and texture map) contain emotional information and can be continuously
modified by neural networks and easily smoothed by averaging in
coefficient/latent spaces, making our method simple yet effective. We also
introduce a mouth shape preservation loss to control the trade-off between lip
synchronization and the degree of exaggeration of the edited expression.
Extensive experiments and a user study show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various evaluation criteria.

dual-camera high-speed imaging experiments were performed at 10, 15 and 20 bar

supervised learning models might exhibit bias towards the majority class and
under-perform in the minority class. Cost-sensitive learning tackles this
problem by treating the classes differently, formulated typically via a
user-defined fixed misclassification cost matrix provided as input to the
learner. Such parameter tuning is a challenging task that requires domain
knowledge and moreover, wrong adjustments might lead to overall predictive
performance deterioration. In this work, we propose a novel cost-sensitive
boosting approach for imbalanced data that dynamically adjusts the
misclassification costs over the boosting rounds in response to model's
performance instead of using a fixed misclassification cost matrix. Our method,
called AdaCC, is parameter-free as it relies on the cumulative behavior of the
boosting model in order to adjust the misclassification costs for the next
boosting round and comes with theoretical guarantees regarding the training
error. Experiments on 27 real-world datasets from different domains with high
class imbalance demonstrate the superiority of our method over 12
state-of-the-art cost-sensitive boosting approaches exhibiting consistent
improvements in different measures, for instance, in the range of [0.3%-28.56%]

of deep networks. By constructing classifiers with varying resource demands
(the exits), such networks allow easy samples to be output at early exits,
removing the need for executing deeper layers. While existing works mainly
focus on the architectural design of multi-exit networks, the training
strategies for such models are largely left unexplored. The current
state-of-the-art models treat all samples the same during training. However,
the early-exiting behavior during testing has been ignored, leading to a gap
between training and testing. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by
sample weighting. Intuitively, easy samples, which generally exit early in the
network during inference, should contribute more to training early classifiers.
The training of hard samples (mostly exit from deeper layers), however, should
be emphasized by the late classifiers. Our work proposes to adopt a weight
prediction network to weight the loss of different training samples at each
exit. This weight prediction network and the backbone model are jointly
optimized under a meta-learning framework with a novel optimization objective.
By bringing the adaptive behavior during inference into the training phase, we
show that the proposed weighting mechanism consistently improves the trade-off
between classification accuracy and inference efficiency. Code is available at

graphs, an iterative line graph construction where nodes in a De Bruijn graph
of order k represent walks of length k-1, while edges represent walks of length
k. We develop a graph neural network architecture that utilizes De Bruijn
graphs to implement a message passing scheme that follows a non-Markovian
dynamics, which enables us to learn patterns in the causal topology of a
dynamic graph. Addressing the issue that De Bruijn graphs with different orders
k can be used to model the same data set, we further apply statistical model
selection to determine the optimal graph topology to be used for message

DBGNNs can leverage temporal patterns in dynamic graphs, which substantially

Kahneman and Tversky, is the base rate neglect bias, according to which humans
fail to consider the base rate of the underlying phenomena when evaluating
conditional probabilities. In this paper, we explore the expression of the base

of students in an Introduction to ML course, from varied backgrounds (computer

Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) was critical for the characterization of the
black hole at the center of our Galaxy - leading to the 2020 Nobel prize in
physics. There is now significant effort to push these OPD limits even further,
in-particular achieving 100nm OPD RMS on the 8m unit telescopes (UT's) to allow
higher contrast and sensitivity at the VLTI. This work calculated the
theoretical atmospheric OPD limit of the VLTI as 5nm and 15nm RMS, with current
levels around 200nm and 100nm RMS for the UT and 1.8m auxillary telescopes
(AT's) respectively, when using bright targets in good atmospheric conditions.
We find experimental evidence for the $f^{-17/3}$ power law theoretically
predicted from the effect of telescope filtering in the case of the ATs which
is not currently observed for the UT's. Fitting a series of vibrating mirrors
modelled as dampened harmonic oscillators, we were able to model the UT OPD PSD
of the gravity fringe tracker to $<1nm/\sqrt{Hz}$ RMSE up to 100Hz, which could
adequately explain a hidden $f^{-17/3}$ power law on the UTs. Vibration
frequencies in the range of 60-90Hz and also 40-50Hz were found to generally
dominate the closed loop OPD residuals of Gravity. Cross correlating
accelerometer with Gravity data, it was found that strong contributions in the
40-50Hz range are coming from the M1-M3 mirrors, while a significant portion of
power from the 60-100Hz contributions are likely coming from between the
M4-M10. From the vibrating mirror model it was shown that achieving sub 100nm
OPD RMS for particular baselines (that have OPD$\sim$200nm RMS) required
removing nearly all vibration sources below 100Hz.

requires more computation power in comparison to other controllers, such as PID
or LQR, since it use cost functions, optimization methods and iteratively
predicts the output of the system and the control commands for some determined
steps in the future (prediction horizon). Thus, the computation power required
depends on the prediction horizon, the complexity of the cost functions and the
optimization. The more steps determined for the horizon the more efficient the
controller can be, but also more computation power is required. Since sometimes
robots are not capable of managing all the computing process locally, it is
important to offload some of the computing process from the robot to the cloud.
But then some disadvantages may occur, such as latency and safety issues. Cloud
computing may offer ""infinity"" computation power but the whole system suffers
in latency. A solution to this is the use of Edge Computing, which will reduce
time delays since the Edge device is much closer to the source of data.
Moreover, by using the Edge we can offload the demanding controller from the
UAV and set a longer prediction horizon and try to get a more efficient
controller.

various large-scale applications including phased arrays, quantum and neural

from a fundamental tradeoff between device length and optical loss that limits
their scaling capabilities. High-finesse ring resonators have been
traditionally used as compact intensity modulators, but their use for phase
modulation have been limited due to the high insertion loss associated with the
phase change. Here, we show that high-finesse resonators can achieve a strong
phase change with low insertion loss by simultaneous modulation of the real and
imaginary parts of the refractive index, to the same extent i.e. $\frac{\Delta
n}{\Delta k} \sim 1$. To implement this strategy, we utilize a hybrid platform
that combines a low-loss SiN ring resonator with electro-absorptive graphene

appreciate the phenomena related to those notions.
  As for Berry's phase, a general survey of the subject is presented using both
Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms.
  The canonical Hamiltonian formalism of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation,
when applied to the anomalous Hall effect, can incorporate the gauge symmetry
of Berry's connection but unable to incorporate the electromagnetic vector
potential simultaneously.
  Transformed to the Lagrangian formalism with a time-derivative term allowed,
the Born-Oppenheimer approximation can incorporate the electromagnetic vector
potential simultaneously with Berry's connection, but the consistent canonical
property is lost and thus becomes classical. The Lagrangian formalism can thus
incorporate both gauge symmetries simultaneously but spoils the basic quantum
symmetries, and thus results in classical anomalous Poisson brackets and the
classical Nernst effect as in the conventional formalism.
  As for chiral anomalies, we present basic materials by the path integral
formulation with an emphasis on fermions on the lattice. A chiral fermion
defined by $\gamma_{5}$ on the lattice does not contain the chiral anomaly for
the non-vanishing lattice spacing $a\neq0$.
  The idea of a spectral flow on the lattice does not lead to an anomaly for
each species doubler separately but rather to a pair production in a general
sense. We also mention that a specific construction called the Ginsparg-Wilson
fermion, which is free of species doublers, may practically be useful. We
discuss the representative applications of Berry's phase and chiral anomalies
in nuclear physics and related fields to illustrate the use of these two basic
notions.

the classic shadow volume technique in computer graphics, we propose a new
method to reduce the solution space effectively. Our method considers the
camera a light source that casts rays toward the object. Such light rays build
a reasonably constrained but sufficiently expressive basis for completion. The
completion process is then formulated as a point displacement optimization
problem. Points are initialized at the partial scan and then moved to their
goal locations with two types of movements for each point: directional
movements along the light rays and constrained local movement for shape
refinement. We design neural networks to predict the ideal point movements to
get the completion results. We demonstrate that our method is accurate, robust,
and generalizable through exhaustive evaluation and comparison. Moreover, it
outperforms state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively on MVP

performance in flocking control. However, methods based on traditional

multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm (SPA-MARL) to boost sample

designed or solved with a non-learning method to aid agents in learning, where
the performance of the policy can be sub-optimal. SPA-MARL recognizes the
difference in performance between the sub-optimal policy and itself, and then
imitates the sub-optimal policy if the sub-optimal policy is better. We
leverage SPA-MARL to solve the flocking control problem. A traditional control
method based on artificial potential fields is used to generate a sub-optimal
policy. Experiments demonstrate that SPA-MARL can speed up the training process

the quality role played by the practice in the method, and iii) noting those
quality practices that have persisted through the software development history.
The identified quality practices that have persisted throughout the history of
the software development processes include prototyping, iterative development,
incremental development, risk-driven development, phase planning, and phase
retrospection. These results would be useful to method engineers who seek to
design high-quality software development methods as these practices serve as

to a gravitational force, which is proportional to the relative surplus of the
cell density compared to the water density.
  We develop a new positivity preserving and high-resolution method for the

channels, we prevent interference between the two channels to achieve a stable

0.8, and a high contrast ratio of 28.8 dB is achieved. Moreover, the chirality
of the logic gate originated from the spin-valley locking effect allows using
different circularly polarized light as inputs, representing ""1"" or ""0"", which
is highly desired in quantum computing. The device's footprint is small,
allowing high-density on-chip integration. In addition, this design can be
experimentally fabricated using current nanofabrication techniques and will

evolved at a tremendous speed. Security and privacy are key concerns on the
IoMT, owing to the huge scale and deployment of IoMT networks. Machine learning
(ML) and blockchain (BC) technologies have significantly enhanced the
capabilities and facilities of healthcare 5.0, spawning a new area known as
""Smart Healthcare."" By identifying concerns early, a smart healthcare system
can help avoid long-term damage. This will enhance the quality of life for
patients while reducing their stress and healthcare costs. The IoMT enables a
range of functionalities in the field of information technology, one of which
is smart and interactive health care. However, combining medical data into a
single storage location to train a powerful machine learning model raises
concerns about privacy, ownership, and compliance with greater concentration.
Federated learning (FL) overcomes the preceding difficulties by utilizing a
centralized aggregate server to disseminate a global learning model.
Simultaneously, the local participant keeps control of patient information,
assuring data confidentiality and security. This article conducts a
comprehensive analysis of the findings on blockchain technology entangled with
federated learning in healthcare. 5.0. The purpose of this study is to
construct a secure health monitoring system in healthcare 5.0 by utilizing a
blockchain technology and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect any
malicious activity in a healthcare network and enables physicians to monitor
patients through medical sensors and take necessary measures periodically by

learning with its broad practical applications. A typical application of LP is
to retrieve the top scoring neighbors for a given source node, such as the
friend recommendation. These services desire the high inference scalability to
find the top scoring neighbors from many candidate nodes at low latencies.
There are two popular decoders that the recent LP models mainly use to compute
the edge scores from node embeddings: the HadamardMLP and Dot Product decoders.
After theoretical and empirical analysis, we find that the HadamardMLP decoders
are generally more effective for LP. However, HadamardMLP lacks the scalability
for retrieving top scoring neighbors on large graphs, since to the best of our
knowledge, there does not exist an algorithm to retrieve the top scoring
neighbors for HadamardMLP decoders in sublinear complexity. To make HadamardMLP
scalable, we propose the Flashlight algorithm to accelerate the top scoring
neighbor retrievals for HadamardMLP: a sublinear algorithm that progressively
applies approximate maximum inner product search (MIPS) techniques with
adaptively adjusted query embeddings. Empirical results show that Flashlight
improves the inference speed of LP by more than 100 times on the large
OGBL-CITATION2 dataset without sacrificing effectiveness. Our work paves the
way for large-scale LP applications with the effective HadamardMLP decoders by
greatly accelerating their inference.

well with time. It is believed that the considered particles are in high vacuum
conditions and forces acting on them are not dissipative, i.e. these particles
move without friction. Depending on whether the particles have an electric
(magnetic) dipole moment, a controlled electric (magnetic) field or nonresonant
laser radiation can be used to slow them down in this way. A detailed analysis
of the features and efficiency of the established particle deceleration
mechanism was carried out on the example of the one-dimensional rectangular

variety of academic fields. Implications of better understanding complexity
include increased knowledge of major evolutionary transitions and the
properties of living and technological systems. Genotype-phenotype (G-P) maps
are fundamental to evolution, and biologically-oriented G-P maps have been
shown to have interesting and often-universal properties that enable evolution
by following phenotype-preserving walks in genotype space. Here we use a
digital logic gate circuit G-P map where genotypes are represented by circuits
and phenotypes by the functions that the circuits compute. We compare two
mathematical definitions of circuit and phenotype complexity and show how these
definitions relate to other well-known properties of evolution such as
redundancy, robustness, and evolvability. Using both Cartesian and Linear
genetic programming implementations, we demonstrate that the logic gate circuit
shares many universal properties of biologically derived G-P maps, with the
exception of the relationship between one method of computing phenotypic
evolvability, robustness, and complexity. Due to the inherent structure of the
G-P map, including the predominance of rare phenotypes, large interconnected
neutral networks, and the high mutational load of low robustness, complex
phenotypes are difficult to discover using evolution. We suggest, based on this
evidence, that evolving complexity is hard and we discuss computational
strategies for genetic-programming-based evolution to successfully find
genotypes that map to complex phenotypes in the search space.

Consequently, the inferences that they have drawn are not true. Finally, we
would like to thank Allagui et al. because this subsequent Response to their
Comment has actually led to a further consolidation of our results that are
supposed to be significant for materials science as well as for fractional
control systems and engineering.

  deterministic Markov process",,,,,"stat.CO math.PR stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) can be used to model complex
dynamical industrial systems. The counterpart of this modeling capability is
their simulation cost, which makes reliability assessment untractable with
standard Monte Carlo methods. A significant variance reduction can be obtained
with an adaptive importance sampling (AIS) method based on a cross-entropy (CE)
procedure. The success of this method relies on the selection of a good family
of approximations of the committor function of the PDMP. In this paper original
families are proposed. They are well adapted to high-dimensional industrial
systems. Their forms are based on reliability concepts related to fault tree
analysis: minimal path sets and minimal cut sets. The proposed method is
discussed in detail and applied to academic systems and to a realistic system
from the nuclear industry.

self-similar solutions through the matter collineation approach. By introducing
the hypothesis of variable brane tension, $\lambda,$ we outline the new
effective field equation (EFE) in the most simple case (symmetric embedding)
under the assumption that the fundamental constants in 5D are constants. In
this case, we find the exact form that each physical quantity may take in order
that the EFE become invariant under scale transformations. By taking into
account such assumptions, we find that in 4D, the gravitational constant
$\kappa^{2}\thicksim\lambda$ while the cosmological constant
$\Lambda\thicksim\lambda^{2}$ are always decreasing. These results are quite
general and valid for any homogeneous self-similar metric. Nevertheless, the
study of the EFE under scale symmetries suggests that $\rho\thicksim\lambda$
(as a functional relationship). This allows to get a growing $\kappa^{2}$ but,
in this case, the fundamental constants in 5D must vary as well. We outline a
toy model allowing such a possibility.

requires to condense the prolix text data into a summary under the guidance of
the query information provided by users. The topic has been studied for a long
time and there are many existing interesting research related to query-based
text summarization. Yet much of the work is not systematically surveyed. This
survey aims at summarizing some interesting work in query-based text
summarization methods as well as related generic text summarization methods.
