  https://github.com/dedeswim/vits-robustness-torch",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we ask whether Vision Transformers (ViTs) can serve as an
underlying architecture for improving the adversarial robustness of machine
learning models against evasion attacks. While earlier works have focused on
improving Convolutional Neural Networks, we show that also ViTs are highly
suitable for adversarial training to achieve competitive performance. We
achieve this objective using a custom adversarial training recipe, discovered
using rigorous ablation studies on a subset of the ImageNet dataset. The
canonical training recipe for ViTs recommends strong data augmentation, in part
to compensate for the lack of vision inductive bias of attention modules, when
compared to convolutions. We show that this recipe achieves suboptimal
performance when used for adversarial training. In contrast, we find that
omitting all heavy data augmentation, and adding some additional bag-of-tricks
($\varepsilon$-warmup and larger weight decay), significantly boosts the
performance of robust ViTs. We show that our recipe generalizes to different
classes of ViT architectures and large-scale models on full ImageNet-1k.
Additionally, investigating the reasons for the robustness of our models, we
show that it is easier to generate strong attacks during training when using
our recipe and that this leads to better robustness at test time. Finally, we
further study one consequence of adversarial training by proposing a way to
quantify the semantic nature of adversarial perturbations and highlight its
correlation with the robustness of the model. Overall, we recommend that the
community should avoid translating the canonical training recipes in ViTs to
robust training and rethink common training choices in the context of
adversarial training.

simultaneously useful for multiple tasks: marginal queries and multitask

directly handle numerical features, in contrast to a number of related prior
approaches which require numerical features to be first converted into {high
cardinality} categorical features via {a binning strategy}. Higher binning
granularity is required for better accuracy, but this negatively impacts
scalability. Eliminating the need for binning allows us to produce synthetic
data preserving large numbers of statistical queries such as marginals on
numerical features, and class conditional linear threshold queries. Preserving
the latter means that the fraction of points of each class label above a
particular half-space is roughly the same in both the real and synthetic data.
This is the property that is needed to train a linear classifier in a multitask
setting. Our algorithm also allows us to produce high quality synthetic data
for mixed marginal queries, that combine both categorical and numerical
features. Our method consistently runs 2-5x faster than the best comparable
techniques, and provides significant accuracy improvements in both marginal
queries and linear prediction tasks for mixed-type datasets.

  Parameter: Optimal Rates for (Non-Smooth) Convex Losses and Extension to
  Non-Convex Losses",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CR math.OC stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study differentially private (DP) stochastic optimization (SO) with loss
functions whose worst-case Lipschitz parameter over all data points may be
extremely large. To date, the vast majority of work on DP SO assumes that the
loss is uniformly Lipschitz continuous over data (i.e. stochastic gradients are
uniformly bounded over all data points). While this assumption is convenient,
it often leads to pessimistic excess risk bounds. In many practical problems,
the worst-case Lipschitz parameter of the loss over all data points may be
extremely large due to outliers. In such cases, the error bounds for DP SO,
which scale with the worst-case Lipschitz parameter of the loss, are vacuous.
To address these limitations, this work provides near-optimal excess risk
bounds that do not depend on the uniform Lipschitz parameter of the loss.
Building on a recent line of work [WXDX20, KLZ22], we assume that stochastic
gradients have bounded $k$-th order moments for some $k \geq 2$. Compared with
works on uniformly Lipschitz DP SO, our excess risk scales with the $k$-th
moment bound instead of the uniform Lipschitz parameter of the loss, allowing
for significantly faster rates in the presence of outliers and/or heavy-tailed
data. For convex and strongly convex loss functions, we provide the first
asymptotically optimal excess risk bounds (up to a logarithmic factor). In
contrast to [WXDX20, KLZ22], our bounds do not require the loss function to be
differentiable/smooth. We also devise an accelerated algorithm for smooth
losses that runs in linear time and has excess risk that is tight in certain
practical parameter regimes. Additionally, our work is the first to address
non-convex non-uniformly Lipschitz loss functions satisfying the Proximal-PL
inequality; this covers some practical machine learning models. Our Proximal-PL
algorithm has near-optimal excess risk.

Although reported in numerical investigations, the shearless bifurcation, i.e.,

this work, we derive an area-preserving map as a local approximation of a
particle transport model for confined plasmas. Multiple shearless curves are
found in this area-preserving map, with the same shearless bifurcation scenario

commercial automotive data, xLPLM wmt21-dense-24-wide-en-X indeed shows much
better evaluation scores using SacreBLEU and hLEPOR metrics than smaller-sized
Marian, even though its score increase rate is lower than Marian after
fine-tuning; 2) on relatively larger-size well prepared clinical data

Marian on two sub-tasks (clinical terms and ontology concepts) using ClinSpEn
offered metrics METEOR, COMET, and ROUGE-L, and totally lost to Marian on

projection-aware convolution layers. Further, the corresponding indexes between
different sensor signals are established in advance in the data preprocessing,
which enables faster cross-modal feature fusion. To address LiDAR points and
image pixels misalignment problems, two new plug-and-play fusion modules,
LiCamFuse and BiLiCamFuse, are proposed. In LiCamFuse, soft query weights with

BiLiCamFuse, the fusion module with dual attention is proposed to deeply
correlate the geometric and textural features of the scene. The quantitative
results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
better feature-level fusion. In addition, the proposed network shows a shorter

However, the mean-field model is violated by the nature of real systems with

approximation guarantees for general mean-field control both in continuous

approach outperforms multi-agent reinforcement learning and allows for

effective method to define fold lines and alleviate stress concentrations at

non-rigid-foldable origami bellows (e.g. Miura-ori, Kresling patterns) the
introduction of small cut-outs at the vertices results in up to an order of
magnitude reduction of the bellows' stiffness under axial compression. Further,
the cut-outs at vertices impact the nonlinear response, e.g. the position and
magnitude of a force limit point and presence of bistable configurations. As
the origami bellows are not rigid foldable, an axial compression will
necessarily result in facet deformations; the small cut-outs at the vertices
are found to provide an unexpectedly large stress alleviation, resulting in
disproportionate changes in mechanical properties of the bellows. In order to
accurately model the mechanics of origami bellows, such manufacturing details
must therefore be captured accurately. Lastly, introducing vertex cut-outs can
be offered as a novel approach to tailoring the stiffness of non-rigid foldable

wide, to explore as much motivated DM parameter space as possible. A diverse,
continuous portfolio of experiments at large, medium, and small scales that

been proposed as a key mechanism supporting generalization in humans, but
evidence of its neural implementation and impact on behavior is still scarce.
Here we study the computational properties associated with compositional
generalization in both humans and artificial neural networks (ANNs) on a highly
compositional task. First, we identified behavioral signatures of compositional
generalization in humans, along with their neural correlates using whole-cortex
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Next, we designed
pretraining paradigms aided by a procedure we term {\em primitives pretraining}
to endow compositional task elements into ANNs. We found that ANNs with this
prior knowledge had greater correspondence with human behavior and neural
compositional signatures. Importantly, primitives pretraining induced abstract
internal representations, excellent zero-shot generalization, and
sample-efficient learning. Moreover, it gave rise to a hierarchy of abstract
representations that matched human fMRI data, where sensory rule abstractions
emerged in early sensory areas, and motor rule abstractions emerged in later
motor areas. Our findings give empirical support to the role of compositional
generalization in human behavior, implicate abstract representations as its
neural implementation, and illustrate that these representations can be
embedded into ANNs by designing simple and efficient pretraining procedures.

Specifically, we employ the notion of `efficiency ordering', a well-analyzed
tool for comparing the performance of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers,
for SGD algorithms in the form of Loewner ordering of covariance matrices
associated with the scaled iterate errors in the long term. Using this
ordering, we show that input sequences that are more efficient for MCMC
sampling also lead to smaller covariance of the errors for SGD algorithms in
the limit. This also suggests that an arbitrarily weighted MSE of SGD iterates
in the limit becomes smaller when driven by more efficient chains. Our finding
is of particular interest in applications such as decentralized optimization
and swarm learning, where SGD is implemented in a random walk fashion on the
underlying communication graph for cost issues and/or data privacy. We
demonstrate how certain non-Markovian processes, for which typical mixing-time
based non-asymptotic bounds are intractable, can outperform their Markovian
counterparts in the sense of efficiency ordering for SGD. We show the utility
of our method by applying it to gradient descent with shuffling and mini-batch
gradient descent, reaffirming key results from existing literature under a
unified framework. Empirically, we also observe efficiency ordering for
variants of SGD such as accelerated SGD and Adam, open up the possibility of
extending our notion of efficiency ordering to a broader family of stochastic

  Minor edits in this version",,,,"math.PR cs.GT econ.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study random-turn resource-allocation games. In the Trail of Lost Pennies,
a counter moves on $\mathbb{Z}$. At each turn, Maxine stakes $a \in [0,\infty)$
and Mina $b \in [0,\infty)$. The counter $X$ then moves adjacently, to the
right with probability $\tfrac{a}{a+b}$. If $X_i \to -\infty$ in this
infinte-turn game, Mina receives one unit, and Maxine zero; if $X_i \to
\infty$, then these receipts are zero and $x$. Thus the net receipt to a given
player is $-A+B$, where $A$ is the sum of her stakes, and $B$ is her terminal
receipt. The game was inspired by unbiased tug-of-war in~[PSSW] from 2009 but
in fact closely resembles the original version of tug-of-war, introduced
[HarrisVickers87] in the economics literature in 1987. We show that the game
has surprising features. For a natural class of strategies, Nash equilibria
exist precisely when $x$ lies in $[\lambda,\lambda^{-1}]$, for a certain
$\lambda \in (0,1)$. We indicate that $\lambda$ is remarkably close to one,
proving that $\lambda \leq 0.999904$ and presenting clear numerical evidence
that $\lambda \geq 1 - 10^{-4}$. For each $x \in [\lambda,\lambda^{-1}]$, we
find countably many Nash equilibria. Each is roughly characterized by an
integral {\em battlefield} index: when the counter is nearby, both players
stake intensely, with rapid but asymmetric decay in stakes as it moves away.
Our results advance premises [HarrisVickers87,Konrad12] for fund management and
the incentive-outcome relation that plausibly hold for many player-funded
stake-governed games. Alongside a companion treatment [HP22] of games with
allocated budgets, we thus offer a detailed mathematical treatment of an
illustrative class of tug-of-war games. We also review the separate
developments of tug-of-war in economics and mathematics in the hope that
mathematicians direct further attention to tug-of-war in its original
resource-allocation guise.

sequence of decisions subject to $m$ long-term constraints. The goal of the
decision maker is to maximize their total reward, while at the same time
achieving small cumulative constraints violation across the $T$ rounds. We
present the first best-of-both-world type algorithm for this general class of
problems, with no-regret guarantees both in the case in which rewards and
constraints are selected according to an unknown stochastic model, and in the
case in which they are selected at each round by an adversary. Our algorithm is
the first to provide guarantees in the adversarial setting with respect to the
optimal fixed strategy that satisfies the long-term constraints. In particular,
it guarantees a $\rho/(1+\rho)$ fraction of the optimal reward and sublinear
regret, where $\rho$ is a feasibility parameter related to the existence of
strictly feasible solutions. Our framework employs traditional regret
minimizers as black-box components. Therefore, by instantiating it with an
appropriate choice of regret minimizers it can handle the full-feedback as well
as the bandit-feedback setting. Moreover, it allows the decision maker to
seamlessly handle scenarios with non-convex rewards and constraints. We show
how our framework can be applied in the context of budget-management mechanisms
for repeated auctions in order to guarantee long-term constraints that are not
packing (e.g., ROI constraints).

continuous couplings on the quantum annealer, which then give rise via quantum
annealing to the set of corresponding phenotypes that represent attempted

can enhance its performance in various ways. Two crucial enhancements come from
the continuous couplings having strengths that are inherited from the fitness
of the parents (so-called nepotism) and from the annealer couplings allowing
the entire population to be influenced by the fittest individuals (so-called

grasping problems. Existing works generally encode the input images into
low-resolution representations via sub-networks and then recover
high-resolution representations. This will lose spatial information, and errors
introduced by the decoder will be more serious when multiple types of objects
are considered or objects are far away from the camera. To address these
issues, we revisit the design paradigm of CNN for robotic perception tasks. We
demonstrate that using parallel branches as opposed to serial stacked
convolutional layers will be a more powerful design for robotic visual grasping
tasks. In particular, guidelines of neural network design are provided for
robotic perception tasks, e.g., high-resolution representation and lightweight
design, which respond to the challenges in different manipulation scenarios. We
then develop a novel grasping visual architecture referred to as HRG-Net, a
parallel-branch structure that always maintains a high-resolution
representation and repeatedly exchanges information across resolutions.
Extensive experiments validate that these two designs can effectively enhance
the accuracy of visual-based grasping and accelerate network training. We show

cosmology. Large galaxy cluster surveys rely on scaling laws that relate
cluster observables to their masses. From the high resolution observations of ~
45 galaxy clusters with NIKA2 and XMM-Newton instruments, the NIKA2 SZ Large
Program should provide an accurate scaling relation between the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and the hydrostatic mass. In this paper, we present
an exhaustive analysis of the hydrostatic mass of the well known galaxy cluster
CL J1226.9+3332, the highest-redshift cluster in the NIKA2 SZ Large Program at
z = 0.89. We combine the NIKA2 observations with thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
data from NIKA, Bolocam and MUSTANG instruments and XMM-Newton X-ray
observations and test the impact of the systematic effects on the mass
reconstruction. We conclude that slight differences in the shape of the mass
profile can be crucial when defining the integrated mass at R500, which
demonstrates the importance of the modeling in the mass determination. We prove
the robustness of our hydrostatic mass estimates by showing the agreement with
all the results found in the literature. Another key information for cosmology
is the bias of the masses estimated assuming hydrostatic equilibrium
hypothesis. Based on the lensing convergence maps from the Cluster Lensing And
Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) data, we obtain the lensing mass estimate
for CL J1226.9+3332. From this we are able to measure the
hydrostatic-to-lensing mass bias for this cluster, that spans from 1 -

by the models used to translate spectra into atmospheric properties.
Limitations stemming from our stellar and atmospheric models have already been
highlighted. Here, we show that the current limitations of the opacity models
used to decode exoplanet spectra propagate into an accuracy wall at ~0.5-1.0
dex (i.e., 3 to 10x) on the atmospheric properties, which is an order of
magnitude above the precision targeted by JWST Cycle 1 programs and needed for,
e.g., meaningful C/O-ratio constraints and biosignatures identification. We
perform a sensitivity analysis using nine different opacity models and find
that most of the retrievals produce harmonious fits owing to compensations in
the form of >5$\sigma$ biases on the derived atmospheric parameters translating
in the aforementioned accuracy wall. We suggest a two-tier approach to
alleviate this problem involving a new retrieval procedure and guided
improvements in opacity data, their standardization and optimal dissemination.

to the turbulent heat flux. As a result, the turbulent heat flux depends
explicitly not only on the gradients of the large-scale temperature, but it
also depends on the gradients of the large-scale velocity. This is because the
nonuniform large-scale flows produce anisotropic velocity fluctuations which
modify the turbulent heat flux. This effect causes an excitation of a
convective-wind instability and formation of large-scale semi-organised
coherent structures (large-scale convective cells). We perform mean-field
numerical simulations of shear-free convection which take into account the
modification of the turbulent heat flux by nonuniform large-scale flows. The
redistribution of the turbulent heat flux by the nonuniform large-scale motions
in turbulent convection plays a crucial role in the formation of the
large-scale semi-organised coherent structures. This effect results in a strong
reduction of the critical effective Rayleigh number (based on the eddy
viscosity and turbulent temperature diffusivity) required for the formation of
the large-scale convective cells. The convective-wind instability is excited

convective cells, there are local regions with the positive vertical gradient
of the potential temperature which implies that these regions are stably

to large images is still computationally difficult. A large reason for this is
that self-attention scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which in
turn, scales quadratically with the image size. On larger images (e.g., 1080p),
over 60% of the total computation in the network is spent solely on creating
and applying attention matrices. We take a step toward solving this issue by
introducing Hydra Attention, an extremely efficient attention operation for
Vision Transformers (ViTs). Paradoxically, this efficiency comes from taking
multi-head attention to its extreme: by using as many attention heads as there
are features, Hydra Attention is computationally linear in both tokens and
features with no hidden constants, making it significantly faster than standard
self-attention in an off-the-shelf ViT-B/16 by a factor of the token count.
Moreover, Hydra Attention retains high accuracy on ImageNet and, in some cases,
actually improves it.

Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RBPFs), which exactly solve inference
problems when possible and fall back on sampling approximations when necessary.
While RBPFs can be implemented by hand to provide efficient inference, the goal
of streaming probabilistic programming is to automatically generate such
efficient inference implementations given input probabilistic programs.
  In this work, we propose semi-symbolic inference, a technique for executing
probabilistic programs using a runtime inference system that automatically
implements Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering. To perform exact and
approximate inference together, the semi-symbolic inference system manipulates
symbolic distributions to perform exact inference when possible and falls back
on approximate sampling when necessary. This approach enables the system to
implement the same RBPF a developer would write by hand. To ensure this, we
identify closed families of distributions -- such as linear-Gaussian and finite
discrete models -- on which the inference system guarantees exact inference. We
have implemented the runtime inference system in the ProbZelus streaming
probabilistic programming language. Despite an average $1.6\times$ slowdown
compared to the state of the art on existing benchmarks, our evaluation shows
that speedups of $3\times$-$87\times$ are obtainable on a new set of

server unavailable to legitimate clients. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a
frequent target of DDoS attacks. Since DNS is a critical infrastructure
service, protecting it from DoS is imperative. Many prior approaches have
focused on specific filters or anti-spoofing techniques to protect generic
services. DNS root nameservers are more challenging to protect, since they use
fixed IP addresses, serve very diverse clients and requests, receive
predominantly UDP traffic that can be spoofed, and must guarantee high quality
of service. In this paper we propose a layered DDoS defense for DNS root
nameservers. Our defense uses a library of defensive filters, which can be
optimized for different attack types, with different levels of selectivity. We
further propose a method that automatically and continuously evaluates and
selects the best combination of filters throughout the attack. We show that
this layered defense approach provides exceptional protection against all
attack types using traces of ten real attacks from a DNS root nameserver. Our
automated system can select the best defense within seconds and quickly reduces
traffic to the server within a manageable range, while keeping collateral
damage lower than 2%. We can handle millions of filtering rules without

technique to generate image sequences of the flow of a contrast material inside

the esophagus has only been demonstrated in few feasibility studies and is
relatively unexplored. In this work, we present a computational framework
called mechanics-informed MRI (MRI-MECH) that enhances that capability thereby
increasing the applicability of dynamic MRI for diagnosing esophageal
disorders. Pineapple juice was used as the swallowed contrast material for the
dynamic MRI and the MRI image sequence was used as input to the MRI-MECH. The
MRI-MECH modeled the esophagus as a flexible one-dimensional tube and the
elastic tube walls followed a linear tube law. Flow through the esophagus was
then governed by one-dimensional mass and momentum conservation equations.
These equations were solved using a physics-informed neural network (PINN). The
PINN minimized the difference between the measurements from the MRI and model
predictions ensuring that the physics of the fluid flow problem was always
followed. MRI-MECH calculated the fluid velocity and pressure during esophageal
transit and estimated the mechanical health of the esophagus by calculating
wall stiffness and active relaxation. Additionally, MRI-MECH predicted missing
information about the lower esophageal sphincter during the emptying process,
demonstrating its applicability to scenarios with missing data or poor image
resolution. In addition to potentially improving clinical decisions based on
quantitative estimates of the mechanical health of the esophagus, MRI-MECH can
also be enhanced for application to other medical imaging modalities to enhance
their functionality as well.

downstream applications, such as node classification. One popular pre-training
method is to mask out a proportion of the edges, and a GNN is trained to
recover them. However, such a generative method suffers from graph mismatch.
That is, the masked graph inputted to the GNN deviates from the original graph.
To alleviate this issue, we propose DiP-GNN (Discriminative Pre-training of

identities of the masked edges, and simultaneously, we train a discriminator to
distinguish the generated edges from the original graph's edges. In our

Extensive experiments on large-scale homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs

filtering to line-intensity mapping (LIM) signal reconstructions. Originally
introduced for reconstruction of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect in the
cosmic microwave background, the LCB filter is an optimal map estimator that
extends the simple Wiener filter by leveraging external correlated data. Given
a detectable strong LIM-galaxy or LIM-LIM cross power spectrum, we show
recovery of high-redshift, large-scale line-intensity fluctuations -- even in
the presence of bright interloper emission -- in simulations of a futuristic [C
II] LIM survey as well as simulated future iterations of the CO Mapping Array
Project (COMAP). With sufficient galaxy abundances or low LIM survey noise,
normalised cross-correlation between the LCB reconstruction and the true signal
reaches 70-90% on large, linear comoving scales corresponding to $k\sim0.1$
Mpc$^{-1}$. This suggests the possible use of such signal reconstructions in
astrophysical or cosmological contexts that require identifying the locations
of line emissivity peaks and voids, although clear shortcomings exist on
smaller scales. The successful application of the LCB filter in simulated LIM
contexts highlights the importance of cross-correlations to studies of the
reionising and reionised high-redshift universe with LIM and other large-scale
structure surveys.

balance between change and stability, order and chaos -- is usually found for a
very narrow region in the parameter space, close to a phase transition. Using
random Boolean networks -- a general model of discrete dynamical systems -- we

objective function by only leveraging a static dataset of designs and their
scores. This problem setting arises in numerous fields including the design of
materials, robots, DNA sequences, and proteins. Recent approaches train a deep
neural network (DNN) on the static dataset to act as a proxy function, and then
perform gradient ascent on the existing designs to obtain potentially
high-scoring designs. This methodology frequently suffers from the
out-of-distribution problem where the proxy function often returns poor
designs. To mitigate this problem, we propose BiDirectional learning for
offline Infinite-width model-based optimization (BDI). BDI consists of two
mappings: the forward mapping leverages the static dataset to predict the
scores of the high-scoring designs, and the backward mapping leverages the
high-scoring designs to predict the scores of the static dataset. The backward
mapping, neglected in previous work, can distill more information from the
static dataset into the high-scoring designs, which effectively mitigates the
out-of-distribution problem. For a finite-width DNN model, the loss function of
the backward mapping is intractable and only has an approximate form, which
leads to a significant deterioration of the design quality. We thus adopt an
infinite-width DNN model, and propose to employ the corresponding neural
tangent kernel to yield a closed-form loss for more accurate design updates.
Experiments on various tasks verify the effectiveness of BDI. The code is

despite different initialisations, the solutions found by SGD lie in the same
loss valley after taking into account the permutation invariance of neural
networks. Concretely, they hypothesise that any two solutions found by SGD can
be permuted such that the linear interpolation between their parameters forms a
path without significant increases in loss. Here, we use a simple but powerful
algorithm to find such permutations that allows us to obtain direct empirical
evidence that the hypothesis is true in fully connected networks. Strikingly,
we find that two networks already live in the same loss valley at the time of

zero-shot generalization in many downstream tasks with properly designed text

prompts using the training data from downstream tasks. While effective,
training on domain-specific data reduces a model's generalization capability to
unseen new domains. In this work, we propose test-time prompt tuning (TPT), a
method that can learn adaptive prompts on the fly with a single test sample.
For image classification, TPT optimizes the prompt by minimizing the entropy
with confidence selection so that the model has consistent predictions across
different augmented views of each test sample. In evaluating generalization to
natural distribution shifts, TPT improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP
by 3.6% on average, surpassing previous prompt tuning approaches that require
additional task-specific training data. In evaluating cross-dataset
generalization with unseen categories, TPT performs on par with the
state-of-the-art approaches that use additional training data. Project page:

outflows remain collimated and successfully emerge through the environment.
However, they fail to attain relativistic velocities and only reach a mean
maximum speed of ~0.7c for the realistic jet, and ~0.6c for the analytical jet.
We also find that the realistic jet has a much more complex structure. The lack
of highly relativistic speeds, that makes these jets unsuitable as short GRB

  Polytope of (Bipartite) Graphs",,,,,"cs.DS cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present new results for online contention resolution schemes for the
matching polytope of graphs, in the random-order (RCRS) and adversarial (OCRS)
arrival models. Our results include improved selectability guarantees (i.e.,
lower bounds), as well as new impossibility results (i.e., upper bounds). By
well-known reductions to the prophet (secretary) matching problem, a
$c$-selectable OCRS (RCRS) implies a $c$-competitive algorithm for adversarial
(random order) edge arrivals. Similar reductions are also known for the
query-commit matching problem. For the adversarial arrival model, we present a
new analysis of the OCRS of Ezra et al.~(EC, 2020). We show that this scheme is
$0.344$-selectable for general graphs and $0.349$-selectable for bipartite
graphs, improving on the previous $0.337$ selectability result for this
algorithm. We also show that the selectability of this scheme cannot be greater
than $0.361$ for general graphs and $0.382$ for bipartite graphs. We further
show that no OCRS can achieve a selectability greater than $0.4$ for general
graphs, and $0.433$ for bipartite graphs.
  For random-order arrivals, we present two attenuation-based schemes which use
new attenuation functions. Our first RCRS is $0.474$-selectable for general
graphs, and our second is $0.476$-selectable for bipartite graphs. These
results improve upon the recent $0.45$ (and $0.456$) selectability results for
general graphs (respectively, bipartite graphs) due to Pollner et al.~(EC,
2022). On general graphs, our 0.474-selectable RCRS provides the best known
positive result even for offline contention resolution, and also for the
correlation gap. We conclude by proving a fundamental upper bound of 0.5 on the
selectability of RCRS, using bipartite graphs.

networks. This problem is critical to on-device machine learning applications
but has been overlooked in the literature where research has been merely
focused on large models. Tiny neural networks have much fewer parameters and
lower complexity and therefore should not be trained the same way as their
large counterparts for DG applications. By conducting extensive experiments, we
find that knowledge distillation (KD), a well-known technique for model
compression, is much better for tackling the on-device DG problem than
conventional DG methods. Another interesting observation is that the
teacher-student gap on out-of-distribution data is bigger than that on
in-distribution data, which highlights the capacity mismatch issue as well as
the shortcoming of KD. We further propose a method called out-of-distribution
knowledge distillation (OKD) where the idea is to teach the student how the
teacher handles out-of-distribution data synthesized via disruptive data
augmentation. Without adding any extra parameter to the model -- hence keeping
the deployment cost unchanged -- OKD significantly improves DG performance for
tiny neural networks in a variety of on-device DG scenarios for image and
speech applications. We also contribute a scalable approach for synthesizing
visual domain shifts, along with a new suite of DG datasets to complement
existing testbeds.

in computer science and combinatorial optimization. Tree edit distance is a
natural generalization of edit distance in which the task is to compute a
measure of dissimilarity between two (unweighted) rooted trees with node
labels. Perhaps the most notable recent application of tree edit distance is in
NoSQL big databases, such as MongoDB, where each row of the database is a JSON
document represented as a labeled rooted tree, and finding dissimilarity
between two rows is a basic operation. Until recently, the fastest algorithm
for tree edit distance ran in cubic time (Demaine, Mozes, Rossman, Weimann;
TALG'10); however, Mao (FOCS'21) broke the cubic barrier for the tree edit
distance problem using fast matrix multiplication.
  Given a parameter $k$ as an upper bound on the distance, an $O(n+k^2)$-time
algorithm for edit distance has been known since the 1980s due to the works of
Myers (Algorithmica'86) and Landau and Vishkin (JCSS'88). The existence of an
$\tilde{O}(n+\mathrm{poly}(k))$-time algorithm for tree edit distance has been
posed as an open question, e.g., by Akmal and Jin (ICALP'21), who gave a
state-of-the-art $\tilde{O}(nk^2)$-time algorithm. In this paper, we answer
this question positively.

large distances, the most reasonable way to have significant modifications is
to introduce one or more light scalars that mediate a new long-range force.
Most existing studies of such scalars invoke models that exhibit some kind of
""screening"" at short distances to hide the force from solar system tests.
However, as is well known, such modifications also exhibit superluminality,
which can be interpreted as a form of acausality. In this work we explore
explicitly subluminal and causal scalar field models. In particular, we study a
conformally coupled scalar $\phi$, with a small coupling to matter to obey
solar system bounds, and a non-canonical kinetic term $K(X)$
($X=(\partial\phi)^2/2$) that obeys all subluminality constraints and is
hyperbolic. We consider $K(X)$ that is canonical for small $X$, but beyond some
nonlinear scale enters a new scaling regime of power $p$, with $1/2<p<1$ (the
DBI kinetic term is the limit $p=1/2$ and a canonical scalar is $p=1$). As
opposed to screening (and superluminality), this new force becomes more and
more important in the regime of high densities (and subluminality). We then
turn to the densest environments to put bounds on this new interaction. We
compute constraints from precession in binary systems such as Hulse-Taylor, we
compute corrections to neutron star hydrostatic equilibrium, and we compute
power in radiation, both tensor mode corrections and the new scalar mode, which
can be important during mergers.

cross-modal alignment tasks (e.g., image/video-text retrieval), and multi-modal

and an extended polar wind. It is also a member of a close binary system with
an early A-type dwarf companion. We aim to determine the orbital parameters of
the Achernar system and to estimate the physical properties of the components.
We monitored the relative position of Achernar B using a broad range of high
angular resolution instruments of the VLT/VLTI (VISIR, NACO, SPHERE, AMBER,
PIONIER, GRAVITY, and MATISSE) over a period of 13 years (2006-2019). These
astrometric observations are complemented with a series of more than 700
optical spectra for the period from 2003 to 2016. We determine that Achernar B
orbits the Be star on a seven-year period, eccentric orbit (e = 0.7255 +/-
0.0014) which brings the two stars within 2 au at periastron. The mass of the
Be star is found to be mA = 6.0 +/- 0.6 Msun for a secondary mass of mB = 2.0
+/- 0.1 Msun. We find a good agreement of the parameters of Achernar A with the
evolutionary model of a critically rotating star of 6.4 Msun at an age of 63
million years. We also identify a resolved comoving low-mass star, which leads
us to propose that Achernar is a member of the Tucana-Horologium moving group.
Achernar A is presently in a short-lived phase of its evolution following the
turn-off, during which its geometrical flattening ratio is the most extreme.
Considering the orbital parameters, no significant interaction occurred between
the two components, demonstrating that Be stars may form through a direct,
single-star evolution path without mass transfer. Since component A will enter
the instability strip in a few hundred thousand years, Achernar appears to be a
promising progenitor of the Cepheid binary systems.

completely or partially destroyed by tides. In a partial tidal disruption event
(TDE) the high-density core of the star remains intact, and the low-density,
outer envelope of the star is stripped and feeds a luminous accretion episode.
The TDE AT2018fyk, with an inferred black hole mass of $10^{7.7\pm0.4}$
M$_{\odot}$, experienced an extreme dimming event at X-ray (factor of $>$6000)
and UV (factor $\sim$15) wavelengths $\sim$500--600 days after discovery. Here
we report on the re-emergence of these emission components roughly 1200 days
after discovery. We find that the source properties are similar to those of the
pre-dimming accretion state, suggesting that the accretion flow was rejuvenated
to a similar state. We propose that a repeating partial TDE, where the
partially disrupted star is on a $\sim 1200$ day orbit about the SMBH and is
periodically stripped of mass during each pericenter passage, powers its unique
lightcurve. This scenario provides a plausible explanation for AT2018fyk's
overall properties, including the rapid dimming event and the rebrightening at
late times. We also provide testable predictions for the behavior of the
accretion flow in the future: if the second encounter was also a partial
disruption then we predict another strong dimming event around day 1800 (August
2023), and a subsequent rebrightening around day 2400 (March 2025). This source
provides strong evidence of the partial disruption of a star by a SMBH.

persistent experimental anomalies. Upcoming multi-messenger detections of
neutron-star merger remnants could provide indirect constraints on the
existence of these particles. We explore the active-sterile flavor conversion
phenomenology in a two-flavor scenario (1 active + 1 sterile species) as a
function of the sterile neutrino mixing parameters, neutrino emission angle
from the accretion torus, and temporal evolution of the merger remnant. The
torus geometry and the neutron richness of the remnant are responsible for the
occurrence of multiple resonant active-sterile conversions. The number of
resonances strongly depends on the neutrino emission direction above or inside
the remnant torus and leads to large production of sterile neutrinos (and no
antineutrinos) in the proximity of the polar axis as well as more sterile
antineutrinos than neutrinos in the equatorial region. As the black hole torus
evolves in time, the shallower baryon density is responsible for more adiabatic
flavor conversion, leading to larger regions of the mass-mixing parameter space
being affected by flavor mixing. Our findings imply that the production of
sterile states could have indirect implications on the disk cooling rate, its
outflows, and related electromagnetic observables which remain to be assessed.

procedure for finding acceptbale model parameters. This allows for the first
comprehensive scan of parameter space consistent with recent Planck and
BICEP/Keck 2018 measurements. Even for trans--Planckian field values the
tensor--to--scalar ratio $r$ can be as small as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-8})$, but the
model can also saturate the current upper bound. In contrast to the
small--field version of this model, radiative stability does not lead to strong
constraints on the parameters of the inflaton potential. For very large field
values the potential can be approximated by the quartic term; as well known,
this allows eternal inflation even for field energy well below the reduced
Planck mass $M_{\rm Pl}$, with Hubble parameter $H \sim 10^{-2} M_{\rm Pl}$.
More interestingly, we find a region of parameter space that even supports {\em
two phases of eternal inflation}. The second epoch only occurs if the slope at
the would--be saddle point is very small, and has $H \sim 10^{-5} M_{\rm Pl}$;
it can only be realized if $r \sim 10^{-2}$, within the sensitivity range of

networks (GANs) is promising to reduce the effort needed for collecting image
data with pixel-wise annotations. However, to learn high-fidelity image-mask
synthesis, existing GAN approaches first need a pre-training phase requiring
large amounts of image data, which limits their utilization in restricted image
domains. In this work, we take a step to reduce this limitation, introducing
the task of one-shot image-mask synthesis. We aim to generate diverse images
and their segmentation masks given only a single labelled example, and
assuming, contrary to previous models, no access to any pre-training data. To
this end, inspired by the recent architectural developments of single-image
GANs, we introduce our OSMIS model which enables the synthesis of segmentation
masks that are precisely aligned to the generated images in the one-shot
regime. Besides achieving the high fidelity of generated masks, OSMIS
outperforms state-of-the-art single-image GAN models in image synthesis quality
and diversity. In addition, despite not using any additional data, OSMIS
demonstrates an impressive ability to serve as a source of useful data
augmentation for one-shot segmentation applications, providing performance
gains that are complementary to standard data augmentation techniques. Code is

coexistence equilibrium we apply a quasi steady-state argument to reduce the
full model to a two-dimensional one that exhibits a global asymptotically
stable established-strain-only equilibrium or global asymptotically stable
coexistence equilibrium. Our results indicate that the basic reproduction
numbers of both strains govern the overall dynamics, but in nontrivial ways due
to the inclusion of cross-immunity. The model is applied to study the emergence

that may explain the dark matter usually involves a dark Higgs field which is a
singlet under the standard model (SM) gauge group. The dark sector can couple
to the SM particles via the portal coupling between the SM-like Higgs and dark
Higgs fields. Through this coupling, the dark sector particles can be produced
in either the early universe or the collider experiments. Interestingly, not
only the SM-like Higgs boson can decay into the light dark bosons, but also a
light dark Higgs boson may be produced and decay into the dark bosons in a
collider. In this paper, we perform the first collider search for invisible
decays by taking both the Higgs bosons into account. We use a multivariate
technique to best discriminate the signal from the background. We find that a
large parameter region can be {probed} at the International Linear Collider
(ILC) operating at the center-of-mass energy of 250 GeV. In particular, even
when the SM-like Higgs invisible decay is a few orders of magnitude below the
planned sensitivity reaches of the ILC and the high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC),
the scenario can be probed by the invisible decay of the dark Higgs boson
produced via a similar diagram. Measuring the dark Higgs boson decay into the
dark sector will be a smoking gun signal of the light dark sector. A similar
search of the dark sector would be expected in, e.g., Cool Copper Collider
(C$^3$), Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), Compact Linear Collider
(CLIC) and {Future Circular electron-positron Collider (FCC-ee).

the reflection/emission spectra over multiple orbits using the Planetary

clouds affect the simulated observations. We show that inter-annual climate
variations, as well short-term variations due to clouds, can be observed in our
simulated atmospheres with a telescope concept such as LUVOIR or HabEx. Annual
variability and seasonal variability can change the planet's reflected flux
(including the reflected flux of key spectral features such as O$_2$ and
H$_2$O) by up to factors of 5 and 20, respectively, for the same orbital phase.
This variability is best observed with a high-throughput coronagraph. For
example, HabEx (4 m) with a starshade performs up to a factor of two times
better than a LUVOIR B (6 m) style telescope. The variability and
signal-to-noise ratio of some spectral features depends non-linearly on
atmospheric O$_2$ concentration. This is caused by temperature and chemical
column depth variations, as well as generally increased liquid and ice cloud
content for atmospheres with O$_2$ concentrations of $<$1% PAL.

describing the emission of electrons from a model metal surface by a classical
oscillating electric field. Placing the metal in the half-space $x\leqslant 0$,
the Schr\""odinger equation of the system is
$i\partial_t\psi=-\frac12\partial_x^2\psi+\Theta(x) (U-E x \cos\omega t)\psi$,
$t>0$, $x\in\mathbb R$, where $\Theta(x)$ is the Heaviside function and $U>0$
is the effective confining potential (we choose units so that $m=e=\hbar=1$).
The amplitude $E$ of the external electric field and the frequency $\omega$ are
arbitrary. We prove existence and uniqueness of classical solutions of this
equation for general initial conditions $\psi(x,0)=f(x)$, $x\in\mathbb R$. When
the initial condition is in $L^2$ the evolution is unitary and the wave
function goes to zero at any fixed $x$ as $t\to\infty$. To show this we prove a
RAGE type theorem and show that the discrete spectrum of the quasienergy
operator is empty. To obtain positive electron current we consider non-$L^2$
initial conditions containing an incoming beam from the left. The beam is
partially reflected and partially transmitted for all $t>0$. For these we show
that the solution approaches in the large $t$ limit a periodic state that
satisfies an infinite set of equations formally derived by Faisal, et. al. Due
to a number of pathological features of the Hamiltonian (among which
unboundedness in the physical as well as the spatial Fourier domain) the
existing methods to prove such results do not apply, and we introduce new, more
general ones. The actual solution exhibits a very complex behavior. It shows a
steep increase in the current as the frequency passes a threshold value
$\omega=\omega_c$, with $\omega_c$ depending on the strength of the electric
field. For small $E$, $\omega_c$ represents the threshold in the classical
photoelectric effect.

originates from the strain-induced renormalization of the Ir-O-Ir superexchange

metaphor known as Butterfly Mating Optimization (BMO). In BMO, the Bfly follows
the patrolling mating phenomena and simultaneously captures all the local
optima of multimodal functions. To imitate this algorithm, a mobile robot
(Bflybot) was designed to meet the features of the Bfly in the BMO algorithm.
Also, the multi-Bflybot swarm is designed to act like butterflies in nature and
follow the algorithm's rules. The real-time experiments were performed on the
BMO algorithm in the multi-robotic arena and considered the signal source as
the light source. The experimental results show that the BMO algorithm is
applicable to detect multiple signal sources with significant variations in
their movements i.e., static and dynamic. In the case of static signal sources,
with varying initial locations of Bflybots, the convergence is affected in
terms of time and smoothness. Whereas the experiments with varying step-size
leads to their variation in the execution time and speed of the bots. In this
work, experiments were performed in a dynamic environment where the movement of
the signal source in both maneuvering and non-maneuvering scenarios. The
Bflybot swarm is able to detect the single and multi-signal sources, moving
linearly in between two fixed points, in circular, up and down movements.To
evaluate the BMO phenomenon, various ongoing and prospective works such as

Chapter 4, we introduce order-forcing, a tool for constraining convex

with no local obstructions. In Chapter 5, we relate oriented matroids to convex
neural codes, showing that a code has a realization with convex polytopes iff
it is the image of a representable oriented matroid under a neural code
morphism. We also show that determining whether a code is convex is at least as
difficult as determining whether an oriented matroid is representable, implying
that the problem of determining whether a code is convex is NP-hard. Next, we
turn to the problem of the underlying rank of a matrix. This problem is
motivated by the problem of determining the dimensionality of (neural) data
which has been corrupted by an unknown monotone transformation. In Chapter 6,
we introduce two tools for computing underlying rank, the minimal nodes and the
Radon rank. We apply these to analyze calcium imaging data from a larval
zebrafish. In Chapter 7, we explore the underlying rank in more detail,
establish connections to oriented matroid theory, and show that computing
underlying rank is also NP-hard. Finally, we study the dynamics of
threshold-linear networks (TLNs), a simple model of the activity of neural
circuits. In Chapter 9, we describe the nullcline arrangement of a threshold
linear network, and show that a subset of its chambers are an attracting set.
In Chapter 10, we focus on combinatorial threshold linear networks (CTLNs),

understanding often uses query rewriting to disambiguate user-input queries.
While using e-commerce search tools, users tend to enter multiple searches,
which we call context, before purchasing. These history searches contain
contextual insights about users' true shopping intents. Therefore, modeling
such contextual information is critical to a better query rewriting model.
However, existing query rewriting models ignore users' history behaviors and
consider only the instant search query, which is often a short string offering
limited information about the true shopping intent.
  We propose an end-to-end context-aware query rewriting model to bridge this
gap, which takes the search context into account. Specifically, our model
builds a session graph using the history search queries and their contained
words. We then employ a graph attention mechanism that models cross-query
relations and computes contextual information of the session. The model
subsequently calculates session representations by combining the contextual
information with the instant search query using an aggregation network. The
session representations are then decoded to generate rewritten queries.
Empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of our method to state-of-the-art
approaches under various metrics. On in-house data from an online shopping
platform, by introducing contextual information, our model achieves 11.6%
improvement under the MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) metric and 20.1% improvement

considerable promise in various applications. Prior work has demonstrated that
deep learning models that take advantage of the data's 3D structure can
outperform standard machine learning on several learning tasks. However, most
prior research in this area has focused on neuroimaging data from adults.
Within the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, a large
longitudinal development study, we examine structural MRI data to predict
gender and identify gender-related changes in brain structure. Results
demonstrate that gender prediction accuracy is exceptionally high (>97%) with
training epochs >200 and that this accuracy increases with age. Brain regions
identified as the most discriminative in the task under study include
predominantly frontal areas and the temporal lobe. When evaluating gender
predictive changes specific to a two-year increase in age, a broader set of
visual, cingulate, and insular regions are revealed. Our findings show a robust
gender-related structural brain change pattern, even over a small age range.
This suggests that it might be possible to study how the brain changes during
adolescence by looking at how these changes are related to different behavioral
and environmental factors.

robustness of deep neural networks separately. In practice, however, models
need to enjoy both types of robustness to ensure reliability. In this work, we
bridge this gap and show that in fact, explicit tradeoffs exist between
adversarial and natural distributional robustness. We first consider a simple
linear regression setting on Gaussian data with disjoint sets of core and
spurious features. In this setting, through theoretical and empirical analysis,
we show that (i) adversarial training with $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms
increases the model reliance on spurious features; (ii) For $\ell_\infty$
adversarial training, spurious reliance only occurs when the scale of the
spurious features is larger than that of the core features; (iii) adversarial
training can have an unintended consequence in reducing distributional
robustness, specifically when spurious correlations are changed in the new test
domain. Next, we present extensive empirical evidence, using a test suite of
twenty adversarially trained models evaluated on five benchmark datasets
(ObjectNet, RIVAL10, Salient ImageNet-1M, ImageNet-9, Waterbirds), that
adversarially trained classifiers rely on backgrounds more than their
standardly trained counterparts, validating our theoretical results. We also
show that spurious correlations in training data (when preserved in the test
domain) can improve adversarial robustness, revealing that previous claims that
adversarial vulnerability is rooted in spurious correlations are incomplete.

late Universe, obtained with radio telescopes through the hydrogen 21cm line
emission, has the potential to become a key cosmological probe in the upcoming
years. We explore the constraining power of 21cm intensity mapping observations
on the full set of cosmological parameters that describe the $\Lambda$CDM
model. We assume a single-dish survey for the SKA Observatory and simulate the
21cm linear power spectrum monopole and quadrupole within six redshift bins in
the range $z=0.25-3$. Forecasted constraints are computed numerically through
Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. We extend the sampler \texttt{CosmoMC} by
implementing the likelihood function for the 21cm power spectrum multipoles. We
assess the constraining power of the mock data set alone and combined with
Planck 2018 CMB observations. We include a discussion on the impact of
extending measurements to non-linear scales in our analysis. We find that 21cm
multipoles observations alone are enough to obtain constraints on the
cosmological parameters comparable with other probes. Combining the 21cm data
set with CMB observations results in significantly reduced errors on all the
cosmological parameters. The strongest effect is on $\Omega_ch^2$ and $H_0$,
for which the error is reduced by almost a factor four. The percentage errors
we estimate are $\sigma_{\Omega_ch^2} = 0.25\%$ and $\sigma_{H_0} = 0.16\%$, to
be compared with the Planck only results $\sigma_{\Omega_ch^2} = 0.99\%$ and
$\sigma_{H_0} = 0.79\%$. We conclude that 21cm SKAO observations will provide a
competitive cosmological probe, complementary to CMB and, thus, pivotal for
gaining statistical significance on the cosmological parameters constraints,
allowing a stress test for the current cosmological model.

involution $I$ of the 3-sphere $S^3$. But exactly how wild is it, analytically?
We prove that any involution $I^h$, topologically conjugate to $I$, must have a
nearly exponential modulus of continuity. Specifically, given any $\alpha>0$,
there exists a sequence of $\delta$'s converging to zero, $\delta > 0$, and
points $x,y \in S^3$ with dist$(x,y) < \delta$, yet dist$(I^h(x), I^h(y)) >
\epsilon$, where $\delta^{-1} =
e^{\left(\frac{\epsilon^{-1}}{\log^{(1+\alpha)}(\epsilon^{-1})}\right)}$, and
dist is the usual Riemannian distance on $S^3$. In particular, $I^h$ stretches
distance much more than a Lipschitz function ($\delta^{-1} = c\epsilon^{-1}$)
or a H\""{o}lder function ($\delta^{-1} = c^\prime(\epsilon^{-1})^{p}$, $1 < p <
\infty$). Bing's original construction and known alternatives (see text) for
$I$ have a modulus of continuity $\delta^{-1} > c \sqrt{2}^{\epsilon^{-1}}$, so
the theorem is reasonably tight -- we prove the modulus must be at least
exponential up to a polylog, whereas the truth may be fully exponential.
Actually, the functional for $\delta^{-1}$ coming out of the proof can be
chosen slightly closer to exponential than stated here (see Theorem 1). Using
the same technique we analyze a large class of ``ramified'' Bing involutions
and show, as a scholium, that given any function $f: \mathbb{R}^+ \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}^+$, no matter how rapid its growth, we can find a corresponding
involution $J$ of the 3-sphere such that any topological conjugate $J^h$ of $J$
must have a modulus of continuity $\delta^{-1}(\epsilon^{-1})$ growing faster
than $f$ (near infinity). There is a literature on inherent differentiability
(references in text) but as far as the authors know the subject of inherent
modulus of continuity is new.

improve the model performance. Therefore, the model consists of two sets of

such models, especially in safety-critical environments, be highly accurate and
well-calibrated. Although some techniques addressing DNN calibration have been
proposed, they are only limited to visual classification applications and
in-domain predictions. Unfortunately, very little to no attention is paid
towards addressing calibration of DNN-based visual object detectors, that
occupy similar space and importance in many decision making systems as their
visual classification counterparts. In this work, we study the calibration of
DNN-based object detection models, particularly under domain shift. To this
end, we first propose a new, plug-and-play, train-time calibration loss for
object detection (coined as TCD). It can be used with various
application-specific loss functions as an auxiliary loss function to improve
detection calibration. Second, we devise a new implicit technique for improving
calibration in self-training based domain adaptive detectors, featuring a new
uncertainty quantification mechanism for object detection. We demonstrate TCD
is capable of enhancing calibration with notable margins (1) across different
DNN-based object detection paradigms both in in-domain and out-of-domain
predictions, and (2) in different domain-adaptive detectors across challenging
adaptation scenarios. Finally, we empirically show that our implicit
calibration technique can be used in tandem with TCD during adaptation to
further boost calibration in diverse domain shift scenarios.

data stored at a central server, where $K$ users, each with some prior linear
side-information, wish to retrieve various linear combinations of the data. The
goal is to determine the minimum amount of information that must be broadcast
to satisfy all the users. The reciprocal of the optimal broadcast cost is the
capacity of LCBC. The capacity is known for up to $K=3$ users. Since LCBC
includes index coding as a special case, large $K$ settings of LCBC are at
least as hard as the index coding problem. Instead of the general setting (all
instances), by focusing on the generic setting (almost all instances) this work
shows that the generic capacity of the symmetric LCBC (where every user has
$m'$ dimensions of side-information and $m$ dimensions of demand) for large
number of users ($K>d$ suffices) is $C_g=1/\Delta_g$, where
$\Delta_g=\min\left\{\max\{0,d-m'\}, \frac{dm}{m+m'}\right\}$, is the broadcast
cost that is both achievable and unbeatable asymptotically almost surely for
large $n$, among all LCBC instances with the given parameters $p,K,d,m,m'$.
Relative to baseline schemes of random coding or separate transmissions, $C_g$
shows an extremal gain by a factor of $K$ as a function of number of users, and
by a factor of $\approx d/4$ as a function of data dimensions, when optimized
over remaining parameters. For arbitrary number of users, the generic capacity
of the symmetric LCBC is characterized within a factor of $2$.

synthetic data. Building on the recent HyperSARA approach, Faceted HyperSARA
leverages the splitting functionality inherent to the underlying primal-dual
forward-backward algorithm to decompose the image reconstruction over multiple
spatio-spectral facets. The approach allows complex regularization to be
injected into the imaging process while providing additional parallelization
flexibility compared to HyperSARA. The present paper introduces new algorithm
functionalities to address real datasets, implemented as part of a fully
fledged MATLAB imaging library made available on Github. A large scale
proof-of-concept is proposed to validate Faceted HyperSARA in a new data and
parameter scale regime, compared to the state-of-the-art. The reconstruction of
a 15 GB wideband image of Cyg A from 7.4 GB of VLA data is considered,
utilizing 1440 CPU cores on a HPC system for about 9 hours. The conducted
experiments illustrate the reconstruction performance of the proposed approach
on real data, exploiting new functionalities to leverage known
direction-dependent effects (DDEs), for an accurate model of the measurement
operator, and an effective noise level accounting for imperfect calibration.
They also demonstrate that, when combined with a further dimensionality
reduction functionality, Faceted HyperSARA enables the recovery of a 3.6 GB
image of Cyg A from the same data using only 91 CPU cores for 39 hours. In this
setting, the proposed approach is shown to provide a superior reconstruction
quality compared to the state-of-the-art wideband CLEAN-based algorithm of the

that selects a single teacher per input image based on a curriculum driven by
the difficulty in classifying the image. In this work, we empirically verify

central to quantum information processing. In this work we show that
Concentratable Entanglement (CE), an operationally motivated entanglement
measure, induces a hierarchy upon pure states from which different entanglement
structures can be certified. In particular, we find that nearly all genuine
multipartite entangled states can be verified through CE. In the process we
find the exact maximal value of CE and corresponding states for up to 18 qubits
and show that these correspond to extremal quantum error correcting codes. The
latter allows us to unravel a deep connection between CE and coding theory.
Finally, our results also offer an alternative proof, on up to 31 qubits, that
absolutely maximally entangled states do not exist.

To construct a dynamical system $(X,\varphi)$ with interesting dynamical

transitivity. By now, various examples of continua $X$ have been constructed in
such a way that the dynamical system $(X,\varphi)$ is transitive. Mostly, they
are examples of continua that are not path-connected, such as the pseudo-arc or

  In this paper, we present an example of a dynamical system $(X,\varphi)$,
where $\varphi$ is a homeomorphism on the continuum $X$ and $X$ is a
path-connected but not locally connected continuum. We construct a transitive
homeomorphism on the Lelek fan. As a by-product, a non-invertible transitive

and AR devices. However, the power efficiency of head-mounted displays is
naturally at odds with growing computational requirements driven by better
resolution, refresh rate, and dynamic ranges, all of which reduce the sustained
usage time of untethered AR/VR devices. For instance, the Oculus Quest 2, under
a fully-charged battery, can sustain only 2 to 3 hours of operation time. Prior
display power reduction techniques mostly target smartphone displays. Directly
applying smartphone display power reduction techniques, however, degrades the
visual perception in AR/VR with noticeable artifacts. For instance, the
""power-saving mode"" on smartphones uniformly lowers the pixel luminance across
the display and, as a result, presents an overall darkened visual perception to
users if directly applied to VR content.
  Our key insight is that VR display power reduction must be cognizant of the
gaze-contingent nature of high field-of-view VR displays. To that end, we
present a gaze-contingent system that, without degrading luminance, minimizes
the display power consumption while preserving high visual fidelity when users
actively view immersive video sequences. This is enabled by constructing a
gaze-contingent color discrimination model through psychophysical studies, and
a display power model (with respect to pixel color) through real-device
measurements. Critically, due to the careful design decisions made in
constructing the two models, our algorithm is cast as a constrained
optimization problem with a closed-form solution, which can be implemented as a
real-time, image-space shader. We evaluate our system using a series of
psychophysical studies and large-scale analyses on natural images. Experiment
results show that our system reduces the display power by as much as 24% with
little to no perceptual fidelity degradation.

rapid quenching in late stage mergers has been recently called into question
with modern simulations and has never been tested observationally. Here we
perform the first empirical assessment of the long-predicted end phase in the
merger sequence. Based on a sample of ~500 post-mergers identified from the
Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), we show that the
frequency of post-merger galaxies that have rapidly shutdown their star
formation following a previous starburst is 30-60 times higher than expected
from a control sample of non-merging galaxies. No such excess is found in a
sample of close galaxy pairs, demonstrating that mergers can indeed lead to a
rapid halt to star formation, but that this process only manifests after
coalescence.

Better-positioned members not only benefit from (faster) access to diverse
information, but innately have more potential influence on information spread.
Structural biases often arise from network formation, and can lead to
significant disparities in information access based on position. Further,
processes such as link recommendation can exacerbate this inequality by relying
on network structure to augment connectivity.
  We argue that one can understand and quantify this social capital through the
lens of information flow in the network. We consider the setting where all
nodes may be sources of distinct information, and a node's (dis)advantage deems
its ability to access all information available on the network. We introduce
three new measures of advantage (broadcast, influence, and control), which are
quantified in terms of position in the network using \it{access signatures} --
vectors that represent a node's ability to share information. We then consider
the problem of improving equity by making interventions to increase the access
of the least-advantaged nodes. We argue that edge augmentation is most
appropriate for mitigating bias in the network structure, and frame a budgeted
intervention problem for maximizing minimum pairwise access.
  Finally, we propose heuristic strategies for selecting edge augmentations and
empirically evaluate their performance on a corpus of real-world social
networks. We demonstrate that a small number of interventions significantly
increase the broadcast measure of access for the least-advantaged nodes (over 5
times more than random), and also improve the minimum influence. Additional
analysis shows that these interventions can also dramatically shrink the gap in
advantage between nodes (over \%82) and reduce disparities between their access
signatures.

aims to maximize their own gain by anticipating and manipulating the
equilibrium state at which followers settle by playing a congestion game.
Large-scale SCGs are well known for their intractability and complexity. This
study approaches SCGs through differentiable programming, which marries the
latest developments in machine learning with conventional methodologies. The
core idea centers on representing the lower-level equilibrium problem using an
evolution path formed by the imitative logit dynamics. It enables the use of
automatic differentiation over the evolution path towards equilibrium, leading
to a double-loop gradient descent algorithm. We further show the fixation on
the lower-level equilibrium may be a self-imposed computational obstacle.
Instead, the leader may only look ahead along the followers' evolution path for
a few steps, while updating their decisions in sync with the followers through
a co-evolution process. The revelation gives rise to a single-loop algorithm
that is more efficient in terms of both memory consumption and computation
time. Through numerical experiments that cover a wide range of benchmark
problems, we find the single-loop algorithm consistently strikes a good balance
between solution quality and efficiency, outperforming not only the standard
double-loop implementation but also other methods from the literature.
Importantly, our results highlight both the wastefulness of ""full anticipation""
and the peril of ""zero anticipation"". If a quick-and-dirty heuristic is needed
for solving a really large SCG, the proposed single-loop algorithm with a
one-step look-ahead makes an ideal candidate.

instructors improve student learning and educational outcomes. Yet, the
information produced may not even reach the educators it is intended to
influence. Prior work has found that instructors often face barriers to
implementing practices in peer-reviewed literature. Some of these barriers are
related to accessing the knowledge in the first place such as difficulty
finding and understanding research and a lack of time to do so. To lower these
barriers, we created an online blog, PERbites, that summarizes recent
discipline-based education research in short posts that use plain language.
Having covered nearly 100 papers to date, we conducted a survey to see if we
were addressing the need we had originally set out to address. We posted a
23-item survey on our website and received 24 usable responses. The results
suggested that readers do generally agree that we are meeting our original
goals. Readers reported that our articles were easier to understand and used
more plain language than a typical discipline-based education research (DBER)
journal article. At the same time, readers thought that all the important
information was still included. Finally, readers said that this approach helped
them keep up with DBER studies and read about papers they otherwise would not
have. However, most readers did not indicate they changed their teaching and
research practice as a result of reading our blog. Our results suggest that
alternative methods of sharing research (e.g., non-peer reviewed publications
or conference talks) can be an effective method of connecting research with
practitioners, and future work should consider how we as a community might
build on these efforts to ensure education research can make meaningful changes
in the classroom.

and cities, occurs over vastly different spatial and temporal scales. Although
research in different fields has developed detailed, system-specific models to
understand each individual system, a unified analysis of different complex
populations is lacking; such an analysis could deepen our understanding of each
system and facilitate cross-pollination of tools and insights across fields.
Here, we analyze time-series data of the human gut microbiome, tropical forest,
and urban employment using a shared framework. We demonstrate that a single,
three-parameter model of stochastic population dynamics can reproduce the
empirical distributions of population abundances and fluctuations in all three
data sets. The three parameters characterizing a species measure its mean
abundance, deterministic stability, and stochasticity. Our analysis reveals
that, despite the vast differences in scale, all three systems occupy a similar
region of parameter space when time is measured in generations. In other words,
although the fluctuations observed in these systems may appear different, this
difference is primarily due to the different observation periods for each
system. Further, we show that the distribution of temporal abundance
fluctuations is described by just two parameters and derive a two-parameter
functional form for abundance fluctuations to improve risk estimation and
forecasting.

commonly used in radiation heat transfer and computer graphics. We use a format
inspired by the hierarchical off-diagonal low rank format, where elements are
recursively partitioned using a quadtree or octree and blocks are compressed
using a sparse singular value decomposition -- the hierarchical matrix is
assembled using dynamic programming. The motivating application is
time-dependent thermal modeling on vast planetary surfaces, with a focus on
permanently shadowed craters which receive energy through indirect irradiance.
In this setting, shape models are comprised of a large number of triangular
facets which conform to a rough surface. At each time step, a quadratic number
of triangle-to-triangle scattered fluxes must be summed; that is, as the sun
moves through the sky, we must solve the same view factor system of equations
for a potentially unlimited number of time-varying righthand sides. We first
conduct numerical experiments with a synthetic spherical cap-shaped crater,
where the equilibrium temperature is analytically available. We also test our
implementation with triangle meshes of planetary surfaces derived from digital
elevation models recovered by orbiting spacecrafts. Our results indicate that
the compressed view factor matrix can be assembled in quadratic time, which is
comparable to the time it takes to assemble the full view matrix itself. Memory
requirements during assembly are reduced by a large factor. Finally, for a
range of compression tolerances, the size of the compressed view factor matrix
and the speed of the resulting matrix vector product both scale linearly (as
opposed to quadratically for the full matrix), resulting in orders of magnitude
savings in processing time and memory space.

of great controversy for decades. Here, we develop a generalized percolation
framework that describes both electrical and thermal conductivity within a
remarkably wide range of filler-to-matrix conductivity ratios (Y_f/Y_m),
covering 20 orders of magnitude. Our unified theory provides a genuine
classification of electrical conductivity with typical Y_f/Y_m >= 10^10 as
insulator-conductor percolation with the standard power-law behavior, and of
thermal conductivity with 10^2<= Y_f/Y_m <= 10^4 as poor-good conductor
percolation characterized by two universal critical exponents. Experimental
verification of the universal and unified features of our theoretical framework
is conducted by constructing a 3D segregated and well-extended network of
multi-walled carbon nanotubes in polypropylene as a model polymer matrix under
a carefully designed fabrication method. We study the evolution of the
electrical and thermal conductivity in our fabricated composites at different
loading levels up to 5 vol%. Significantly, we find an ultralow electrical
percolation threshold at 0.02 vol% and a record-low thermal percolation
threshold at 1.5 vol%. We also apply our theoretical model to a number of 23
independent experimental and numerical datasets reported in the literature,

planets, which scales inversely with the inner working angle. The Vortex Fiber
Nuller (VFN) is an instrument concept designed to characterize exoplanets
within a single beam-width. It requires few optical elements and is compatible
with many coronagraph designs as a complementary characterization tool.
However, the peak throughput for planet light is limited to about 20%, and the
measurement places poor constraints on the planet location and flux ratio. We
propose to augment the VFN design by replacing its single-mode fiber with a
six-port mode-selective photonic lantern, retaining the original functionality
while providing several additional ports that reject starlight but couple
planet light. We show that the photonic lantern can also be used as a nuller
without a vortex. We present monochromatic simulations characterizing the
response of the Photonic Lantern Nuller (PLN) to astrophysical signals and
wavefront errors, and show that combining exoplanet flux from the nulled ports
significantly increases the overall throughput of the instrument. We show using
synthetically generated data that the PLN detects exoplanets more effectively

localized, and its flux ratio constrained. The PLN has the potential to be a
powerful characterization tool complementary to traditional coronagraphs in

reduces the dimension of nonlinear systems in a manner that accounts for either

Two computational challenges have so far prevented its deployment on
large-scale systems: (a) the energy functions required for characterization of
controllability and observability are solutions of high-dimensional
Hamilton-Jacobi-(Bellman) equations, and (b) efficient model reduction and
subsequent reduced-order model (ROM) simulation on the resulting nonlinear

open-loop balancing or a variety of closed-loop balancing options. To solve for
coefficients of the Taylor-series approximation to the energy functions, the

solve structured linear systems with billions of unknowns. The strength and

derive the optimal control policy for a single relay via a semi-Markov decision

outer decisions on radial wait velocities and end positions optimize the

angular wait velocities, service schedules, and UAV trajectories greedily
minimize the instantaneous delay-power costs. Next, generalizing to UAV swarms
via replication and consensus-driven command-and-control, this policy is
embedded with spread maximization and conflict resolution heuristics. We
demonstrate that our framework offers superior performance with respect to
average service latencies and average per-UAV power consumption: 11x faster

eye-movements. For the EyeLink family of eye-trackers, these two filters are

access to unfiltered, STD filtered and EXTRA filtered data for the exact same
recording. Based on the literature, which has employed various eye-tracking
technologies, and our analysis of our EyeLink-1000 data, we conclude that the
highest signal frequency content needed for most eye-tracking studies (i.e.,
saccades, microsaccades and smooth pursuit) is around 100 Hz, excluding
fixation microtremor. For those who collect their data at 1000 Hz or higher, we
test two zero-phase low-pass digital filters, one with a cutoff of 50 Hz and
one with a cutoff of 100 Hz. We perform a Fourier (FFT) analysis to examine the
frequency content for unfiltered data, STD data, EXTRA filtered data, and data
filtered by low-pass digital filters. We also examine the frequency response of
these filters. The digital filter with the 100 Hz cutoff dramatically
outperforms both heuristic filters because the heuristic filters leave noise

(ALP) weakly coupled to degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium by obtaining
its reduced density matrix. Its time evolution is determined by the in-in
effective action which we obtain to leading order in the (ALP) coupling but to
\emph{all orders} in the couplings of the bath to other fields within or beyond
the standard model. The effective equation of motion for the (ALP) is a
Langevin equation with noise and friction kernels obeying the fluctuation
dissipation relation. A ``misaligned'' initial condition yields damped coherent
oscillations, however, the (ALP) population increases towards thermalization
with the bath. As a result, the energy density features a mixture of a cold
component from misalignment and a hot component from thermalization with
proportions that vary in time $(cold)\,e^{-\Gamma t}+(hot)\,(1-e^{-\Gamma t})$,
providing a scenario wherein the ``warmth'' of the dark matter evolves in time
from colder to hotter. As a specific example we consider the (ALP)-photon
coupling $g a \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}$ to lowest order, valid from recombination
onwards. For $T \gg m_a$ the long-wavelength relaxation rate is substantially
enhanced $\Gamma_T = \frac{g^2\,m^2_a\,T}{16\pi} $. The ultraviolet divergences
of the (ALP) self-energy require higher order derivative terms in the effective
action. We find that at high temperature, the finite temperature effective mass
of the (ALP) is $m^2_a(T) = m^2_a(0)\Big[ 1-(T/T_c)^4\Big]$, with $T_c \propto
\sqrt{m_a(0)/g}$, \emph{suggesting} the possibility of an inverted phase
transition, which when combined with higher derivatives may possibly indicate
exotic new phases. We discuss possible cosmological consequences on structure
formation, the effective number of relativistic species and birefringence of

of a feature map and thereby reduce inference compute and memory footprint for
resource-constrained computer vision applications have recently gained
significant traction. However, prior pooling works extract only the local
context of the activation maps, limiting their effectiveness. In contrast, we
propose a novel non-local self-attentive pooling method that can be used as a
drop-in replacement to the standard pooling layers, such as max/average pooling
or strided convolution. The proposed self-attention module uses patch
embedding, multi-head self-attention, and spatial-channel restoration, followed
by sigmoid activation and exponential soft-max. This self-attention mechanism
efficiently aggregates dependencies between non-local activation patches during
down-sampling. Extensive experiments on standard object classification and
detection tasks with various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed mechanism over the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) pooling techniques. In particular, we surpass the test accuracy of
existing pooling techniques on different variants of MobileNet-V2 on ImageNet
by an average of 1.2%. With the aggressive down-sampling of the activation maps
in the initial layers (providing up to 22x reduction in memory consumption),
our approach achieves 1.43% higher test accuracy compared to SOTA techniques
with iso-memory footprints. This enables the deployment of our models in
memory-constrained devices, such as micro-controllers (without losing
significant accuracy), because the initial activation maps consume a
significant amount of on-chip memory for high-resolution images required for
complex vision tasks. Our proposed pooling method also leverages the idea of
channel pruning to further reduce memory footprints.

address the challenges in real-time control of power systems. However, its
deployment in real-world power systems has been hindered by a lack of explicit
stability and safety guarantees. In this paper, we propose a
stability-constrained reinforcement learning (RL) method for real-time voltage
control, that guarantees system stability both during policy learning and
deployment of the learned policy. The key idea underlying our approach is an
explicitly constructed Lyapunov function that leads to a sufficient structural
condition for stabilizing policies, i.e., monotonically decreasing policies
guarantee stability. We incorporate this structural constraint with RL, by
parameterizing each local voltage controller using a monotone neural network,
thus ensuring the stability constraint is satisfied by design. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach in both single-phase and three-phase IEEE
test feeders, where the proposed method can reduce the transient control cost
by more than 25% and shorten the voltage recovery time by 21.5% on average
compared to the widely used linear policy, while always achieving voltage
stability. In contrast, standard RL methods often fail to achieve voltage
stability.

estimation can cause instability and overestimation of the maximal target

several recent ensemble methods, however none have shown success in
sample-efficient learning through addressing estimation variance as the root

method that estimates target values as ensemble means. Despite its simplicity,
MeanQ shows remarkable sample efficiency in experiments on the Atari Learning

sufficiently reduces estimation variance to obviate the lagging target network,
eliminating it as a source of bias and further gaining sample efficiency. We
justify intuitively and empirically the design choices in MeanQ, including the
necessity of independent experience sampling. On a set of 26 benchmark Atari
environments, MeanQ outperforms all tested baselines, including the best
available baseline, SUNRISE, at 100K interaction steps in 16/26 environments,

ultrafast data links that can be applied in a variety of 6G applications,
including heterogeneous networks with enormous connectivity and wireless
backhauls for cellular systems. In this study, we perform video signal
transmissions via an FPGA-based FSO communication prototype to investigate the
feasibility of an FSO link with a distance of up to 20~km. We use a channel
emulator to reliably model turbulence, scintillation, and power attenuation of
the long-range FSO channel. We use the FPGA-based real-time SDR prototype to
process the transmitted and received video signals. Our study also presents the
channel-generation process of a given long-distance FSO link. To enhance the

use sampling-based pointing, acquisition, and tracking to compensate for it by
improving the signal-to-noise ratio. For the main video signal transmission

representation theory of $G$, the (specialized) Hecke algebra
$H=\End_G(\ind_B^G1_B)$ has played a important role. In particular, when
$G=GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ is a finite general linear group, this approach led to
the Dipper-James theory of $q$-Schur algebras $A$. These algebras can be
constructed over $\sZ:=\mathbb Z[t,t^{-1}]$ as the $q$-analog (with $q=t^2$) of
an endomorphism algebra larger than $H$, involving parabolic subgroups. The
algebra $A$ is quasi-hereditary over $\sZ$. An analogous algebra, still denoted
$A$, can always be constructed in other types. However, these algebras have so
far been less useful than in the $GL_n$ case, in part because they are not
generally quasi-hereditary.
  Several years ago, reformulating a 1998 conjecture, the authors proposed (for
all types) the existence of a $\sZ$-algebra $A^+$ having a stratified derived
module category, with strata constructed via Kazhdan-Lusztig cell theory. The
algebra $A$ is recovered as $A=eA^+e$ for an idempotent $e\in A^+$. A main goal
of this monograph is to prove this conjecture completely. The proof involves
several new homological techniques using exact categories. Following the proof,
we show that $A^+$ does become quasi-hereditary after the inversion of the bad
primes. Some first applications of the result -- e.g., to decomposition
matrices -- are presented, together with several open problems.

optimism or posterior sampling (PSRL) is ensured to attain the global
optimality asymptotically by introducing the complexity measure of the model.
However, the complexity might grow exponentially for the simplest nonlinear
models, where global convergence is impossible within finite iterations. When
the model suffers a large generalization error, which is quantitatively
measured by the model complexity, the uncertainty can be large. The sampled
model that current policy is greedily optimized upon will thus be unsettled,
resulting in aggressive policy updates and over-exploration. In this work, we
propose Conservative Dual Policy Optimization (CDPO) that involves a
Referential Update and a Conservative Update. The policy is first optimized
under a reference model, which imitates the mechanism of PSRL while offering
more stability. A conservative range of randomness is guaranteed by maximizing
the expectation of model value. Without harmful sampling procedures, CDPO can
still achieve the same regret as PSRL. More importantly, CDPO enjoys monotonic
policy improvement and global optimality simultaneously. Empirical results also
validate the exploration efficiency of CDPO.

such as the radial distribution function, through molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. The interaction potentials are then learned directly by stochastic
gradient descent, using backpropagation to calculate the gradient of the
structural loss metric with respect to the interaction potential through the MD
simulation. This gradient-based method is flexible and can be configured to
simulate and optimize multiple systems simultaneously. For example, it is
possible to simultaneously learn potentials for different temperatures or for
different compositions. We demonstrate the approach by recovering simple pair
potentials, such as Lennard-Jones systems, from radial distribution functions.
We find that DiffSim can be used to probe a wider functional space of pair
potentials compared to traditional methods like Iterative Boltzmann Inversion.
We show that our methods can be used to simultaneously fit potentials for

been accelerated by the advent of few-shot techniques such as chain of thought

models in a few-shot setup by augmenting the prompts with intermediate steps.
Despite impressive results across various tasks, the reasons behind their
success have not been explored. This work uses counterfactual prompting to
develop a deeper understanding of CoT-based few-shot prompting mechanisms in
large language models. We first systematically identify and define the key
components of a prompt: symbols, patterns, and text. Then, we devise and
conduct an exhaustive set of experiments across four different tasks, by
querying the model with counterfactual prompts where only one of these

conventional wisdom around few-shot prompting. First, the presence of factual

our results conclude that the primary role of intermediate steps may not be to
facilitate learning how to solve a task. The intermediate steps are rather a
beacon for the model to realize what symbols to replicate in the output to form
a factual answer. Further, text imbues patterns with commonsense knowledge and
meaning. Our empirical and qualitative analysis reveals that a symbiotic
relationship between text and patterns explains the success of few-shot
prompting: text helps extract commonsense from the question to help patterns,
and patterns enforce task understanding and direct text generation.

multiple models need to be stored for serving different tasks. To address this
issue, we develop a unified deep learning enabled semantic communication system

with multiple modalities. As the difficulty varies from different tasks,
different numbers of neural network layers are required for various tasks. We
develop a multi-exit architecture in U-DeepSC to provide early-exit results for
relatively simple tasks. To reduce the transmission overhead, we design a
unified codebook for feature representation for serving multiple tasks, in
which only the indices of these task-specific features in the codebook are
transmitted. Moreover, we propose a dimension-wise dynamic scheme that can
adjust the number of transmitted indices for different tasks as the number of
required features varies from task to task. Furthermore, our dynamic scheme can
adaptively adjust the numbers of transmitted features under different channel
conditions to optimize the transmission efficiency. According to simulation
results, the proposed U-DeepSC achieves comparable performance to the
task-oriented semantic communication system designed for a specific task but
with significant reduction in both transmission overhead and model size.

Tests with mock catalogs demonstrate that our estimator provides unbiased HI

the SDSS spectroscopic sample to estimate the local HI mass function (HIMF),
the conditional HI mass function (CHIMF) in galaxy groups and the HI-halo mass

$M_{HI}\gtrsim 5\times 10^9M_{\odot}$, but with higher amplitude and a steeper

cosmic variance which is corrected for the SDSS sample but not for the ALFALFA.
The CHIMFs for all halo masses can be described by a single Schechter function,
and this is true for red, blue and satellite galaxies. For central galaxies the
CHIMFs show a double-Gaussian profile, with the two components contributed by
the red and blue galaxies, respectively. The total HI mass in a group increases
monotonically with halo mass. The HI mass of central galaxies in galaxy groups
increases rapidly with halo mass only at $M_h\lesssim10^{12}M_{\odot}$, while

(DB). However, for dense prediction tasks such as domain adaptive semantic
segmentation (DASS), existing solutions have mostly relied on rough style
transfer and how to elegantly bridge domains is still under-explored. In this
work, we resort to data mixing to establish a deliberated domain bridging (DDB)

are aligned and interacted with each in the intermediate space. At the heart of
DDB lies a dual-path domain bridging step for generating two intermediate
domains using the coarse-wise and the fine-wise data mixing techniques,
alongside a cross-path knowledge distillation step for taking two complementary
models trained on generated intermediate samples as 'teachers' to develop a
superior 'student' in a multi-teacher distillation manner. These two
optimization steps work in an alternating way and reinforce each other to give
rise to DDB with strong adaptation power. Extensive experiments on adaptive

  Approach in Markov Decision Processes","Preprint version",,,,"cs.LG cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lying on the heart of intelligent decision-making systems, how policy is
represented and optimized is a fundamental problem. The root challenge in this
problem is the large scale and the high complexity of policy space, which
exacerbates the difficulty of policy learning especially in real-world
scenarios. Towards a desirable surrogate policy space, recently policy
representation in a low-dimensional latent space has shown its potential in
improving both the evaluation and optimization of policy. The key question
involved in these studies is by what criterion we should abstract the policy
space for desired compression and generalization. However, both the theory on
policy abstraction and the methodology on policy representation learning are
less studied in the literature. In this work, we make very first efforts to
fill up the vacancy. First, we propose a unified policy abstraction theory,
containing three types of policy abstraction associated to policy features at
different levels. Then, we generalize them to three policy metrics that
quantify the distance (i.e., similarity) of policies, for more convenient use
in learning policy representation. Further, we propose a policy representation
learning approach based on deep metric learning. For the empirical study, we
investigate the efficacy of the proposed policy metrics and representations, in
characterizing policy difference and conveying policy generalization
respectively. Our experiments are conducted in both policy optimization and
evaluation problems, containing trust-region policy optimization (TRPO),
diversity-guided evolution strategy (DGES) and off-policy evaluation (OPE).
Somewhat naturally, the experimental results indicate that there is no a
universally optimal abstraction for all downstream learning problems; while the
influence-irrelevance policy abstraction can be a generally preferred choice.

contrastive learning (GCL) has been one of the most prevalent approaches to
this problem. Despite the remarkable performance those GCL methods have
achieved, existing GCL methods that heavily depend on various manually designed
augmentation techniques still struggle to alleviate the feature suppression
issue without risking losing task-relevant information. Consequently, the
learned representation is either brittle or unilluminating. In light of this,
we introduce the Graph Contrastive Learning with Cross-View Reconstruction
(GraphCV), which follows the information bottleneck principle to learn minimal
yet sufficient representation from graph data. Specifically, GraphCV aims to
elicit the predictive (useful for downstream instance discrimination) and other
non-predictive features separately. Except for the conventional contrastive
loss which guarantees the consistency and sufficiency of the representation
across different augmentation views, we introduce a cross-view reconstruction
mechanism to pursue the disentanglement of the two learned representations.
Besides, an adversarial view perturbed from the original view is added as the
third view for the contrastive loss to guarantee the intactness of the global
semantics and improve the representation robustness. We empirically demonstrate
that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art on graph
classification task over multiple benchmark datasets.

the traditional field of space weather research and could also provide us with

Based on 5-years huge amount of flight data, here we comprehensively analyze
the flight departure delays during 57 solar flares. It is found that the

Flight delays during dayside solar flares are more serious than those during
nightside flares, and the longer (shorter) delays tend to occur in the lower

delay rate would be directly modulated by the solar intensity (soft X-ray flux)

topic. It has been commonly accepted that the flight time of the polar flights
may increase during solar proton events because the flights have to change
their route to avoid the high-energy particles. However, apart from such
phenomenon, researches related to the flight time during space weather events
is very rare. Based on the analyses of 39 representative international air
routes around westerlies, it is found that 97.44% (94.87%) of the commercial
airplanes on the westbound (eastbound) air routes reveal shorter (longer)
flight time during solar proton events compared to those during quiet periods,
and the averaged magnitude of change in flight time is ~10 min or 0.21%-4.17%
of the total flight durations. Comparative investigations reassure the
certainty of such phenomenon that the directional differences in flight time
are still incontrovertible regardless of over-land routes (China-Europe) or
over-sea routes (China-Western America). Further analyses suggest that the
solar proton events associated atmospheric heating will change the flight
durations by weakening certain atmospheric circulations, such as the polar jet
stream. While the polar jet stream will not be obviously altered during solar
flares so that the directional differences in flight time are not found.
Besides the conventional space weather effects already known, this paper is the
first report that indicates a distinct new scenario of how the solar proton
events affect flight time. These analyses are also important for aviation since
our discoveries could help the airways optimize the air routes to save
passenger time costs, reduce fuel costs and even contribute to the global
warming issues.

include regions such as the normal high uptake organs, inflammation, and other
infections. In this study, we introduce a false positive reduction network to
overcome this limitation. We firstly introduced a self-supervised pre-trained
global segmentation module to coarsely delineate the candidate tumor regions
using a self-supervised pre-trained encoder. The candidate tumor regions were
then refined by removing false positives via a local refinement module. Our
experiments with the MICCAI 2022 Automated Lesion Segmentation in Whole-Body
FDG-PET/CT (AutoPET) challenge dataset showed that our method achieved a dice
score of 0.9324 with the preliminary testing data and was ranked 1st place in
dice on the leaderboard. Our method was also ranked in the top 7 methods on the
final testing data, the final ranking will be announced during the 2022 MICCAI
AutoPET workshop. Our code is available at:

market and the development of blockchain techniques, which leads to an emerging
NFT market that has become prosperous rapidly then followed by a cooldown.
Nevertheless, the overall rise procedure of the NFT market has not been well
understood. To this end, we consider that social media communities evolving
alongside the market growth, are worth exploring and reasoning about, as the
mineable information might unveil the market behaviors. We explore the
procedure from the perspective of NFT Twitter communities and its impact on the
NFT price moves with two experiments. We perform a Granger causality test on
the number of tweets and the NFT price time series and find that the number of
tweets has a positive impact on (Granger-causes) the price or reversely for
larger part of the 19 top authentic projects but seldom copycat projects.
Besides, to investigate the price moves predictability, we experiment on
predicting Markov normalized NFT price (representing the direction and
magnitude of price moves) given tweets-extracted word features and interpret
the feature importance to find insights. Our results show that social media
words as the predictors result in all 19 top projects having a testing accuracy
evidently above the baseline. Based on the feature importance analysis, we find
that both general market-related words and NFT event-related words have a
markedly positive contribution in predicting price moves. We summarize the
characteristics including categorization and sentiment for the words with the
top and least feature importance.

recently designed for remote sensing object detection (RSOD). However, most of

which may not be efficient due to a lot of precision losses and may not be able
to detect oriented bounding boxes (OBB). Also, the existing OBB detection
methods are difficult to constrain the shape of objects predicted by CNNs
accurately. In this paper, we propose an effective lightweight oriented object
detector (LO-Det). Specifically, a channel separation-aggregation (CSA)
structure is designed to simplify the complexity of stacked separable
convolutions, and a dynamic receptive field (DRF) mechanism is developed to
maintain high accuracy by customizing the convolution kernel and its perception
range dynamically when reducing the network complexity. The CSA-DRF component
optimizes efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Then, a diagonal support
constraint head (DSC-Head) component is designed to detect OBBs and constrain
their shapes more accurately and stably. Extensive experiments on public

usually produced by mergers and massive accretion. Our visual inspection shows
that approximately half of SF satellites have encountered shocks in their host
clusters at $z\leq0.11$. After a satellite crosses a shock front and enters the
postshock region, the ram pressure on it is boosted significantly. Both the CGM
and ISM can be severely impacted, either by striping or compression. The
stripping of the ISM is particularly important for low-mass galaxies with $\log
(M_{*}/M_{\odot})<10$ and can occur even in the outskirts of galaxy clusters.
In comparison, satellites that do not interact with shocks lose their ISM only
in the inner regions of clusters. About half of the ISM is stripped within
about 0.6 Gyr after it crosses the shock front. Our results show that
shock-induced stripping plays an important role in quenching satellite galaxies

goal, neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting if data distributions
across sequential tasks are not stationary over the course of learning. An
effective approach to address such continual learning (CL) problems is to use
hypernetworks which generate task dependent weights for a target network.
However, the continual learning performance of existing hypernetwork based
approaches are affected by the assumption of independence of the weights across
the layers in order to maintain parameter efficiency. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel approach that uses a dependency preserving
hypernetwork to generate weights for the target network while also maintaining
the parameter efficiency. We propose to use recurrent neural network (RNN)
based hypernetwork that can generate layer weights efficiently while allowing
for dependencies across them. In addition, we propose novel regularisation and
network growth techniques for the RNN based hypernetwork to further improve the
continual learning performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed methods, we conducted experiments on several image classification
continual learning tasks and settings. We found that the proposed methods based
on the RNN hypernetworks outperformed the baselines in all these CL settings

framework introduced over a decade ago, using it in applications such as robust
SGD where we need many adaptive robust queries is challenging. This is mainly
due to the lack of Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP) analysis, an essential
ingredient underlying the moments accountant approach for differentially
private deep learning. In this work, we generalize the standard PTR and derive
the first RDP bound for it when the target function has bounded global
sensitivity. We show that our RDP bound for PTR yields tighter DP guarantees
than the directly analyzed $(\eps, \delta)$-DP. We also derive the
algorithm-specific privacy amplification bound of PTR under subsampling. We
show that our bound is much tighter than the general upper bound and close to
the lower bound. Our RDP bounds enable tighter privacy loss calculation for the

velocity up to $\sim$140 km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$ and allows us to estimate the
distance to BP Psc system as $D=135\pm40$ pc. This distance leads to an
estimation of the central source luminosity $L_*\approx1.2L_{\odot}$,
indicating that it is the $\approx$1.3$M_{\odot}$ T Tauri star with an age
$t\lesssim$ 7 Myr. We measured the electron density of order $N_e\sim10^2$

estimated upper limit of the mass-loss rate in NE lobe as
$\dot{M}_{out}\approx1.2\cdot10^{-8}M_{\odot}\cdot yr^{-1}$. The physical
characteristics of the outflow are typical for the low-excitation YSO jets and
consistent with the magnetocentrifugal mechanism of its launching and
collimation. Prominent wiggling pattern revealed in $H\alpha$ images allowed us
to suppose the existence of a secondary substellar companion in a non-coplanar

cut sparsifier of an unweighted undirected graph by taking a near-linear number
of linear measurements on the graph. Subsequent works also studied computing
other graph sparsifiers using linear sketching, and obtained near-linear upper
bounds for spectral sparsifiers [Kapralov-Lee-Musco-Musco-Sidford, FOCS'14] and
first non-trivial upper bounds for spanners [Filtser-Kapralov-Nouri, SODA'21].
All these linear sketching algorithms, however, only work on unweighted graphs.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of weighted graph sparsification by
linear sketching by investigating a natural class of linear sketches that we
call incidence sketches, in which each measurement is a linear combination of
the weights of edges incident on a single vertex. Our results are:
  1. Weighted cut sparsification: We give an algorithm that computes a $(1 +
\epsilon)$-cut sparsifier using $\tilde{O}(n \epsilon^{-3})$ linear
measurements, which is nearly optimal.
  2. Weighted spectral sparsification: We give an algorithm that computes a $(1

linear measurements. Complementing our algorithm, we then prove a superlinear
lower bound of $\Omega(n^{21/20-o(1)})$ measurements for computing some
$O(1)$-spectral sparsifier using incidence sketches.
  3. Weighted spanner computation: We focus on graphs whose largest/smallest

in the context of supersymmetry. The action is then decomposed to the bosonic
sector, which is compared with the $\sigma$-model in string theory at a low
energy limit $\alpha'\xrightarrow{}0$. The dilaton in the $D=10$ string theory
can be realised from the dimensional reduction of $D=11$ supergravity, which
gives the scalar contribution in the action to form the single-charge action.
The field equation of the single-charged action is then derived. An
$SO(D-d)\times Poincare_{d}$ ansatz is introduced to simplify the field
equation. The solution of the field equation bifurcates into the electric
ansatz and the magnetic ansatz. These ansatzes are called p-branes which are
string-like objects that exist in their p-dimensional world volume embedded in
the ambient spacetime. The BPS bounds are saturated for these p-branes, and
upon dimensional reduction, they are similar to extremal Riessner-Nordstrom
black holes up to the scalar. The branic motion is then derived and a special
case of parallel brane orbit is explored. Similar to the Riessner-Nordstrom
black hole, the circular orbit is found to require a specific angular momentum
that increases further from the central brane. The circular orbit always exists
for the extremal case, but the black branes that do not saturate the BPS bound
may not have a circular orbit below a threshold angular momentum.

to simulate low-speed rarefied gas flows. However, in the near-continuum flow
regime, due to limitations on the time step and spatial cell size, it takes
plenty of time to find the steady-state solution. Here we remove these
deficiencies by coupling the LVDSMC with the general synthetic iterative scheme
(GSIS) which permits the simulation at the hydrodynamic scale rather than the
much smaller kinetic scale. As a proof of concept, we propose the
stochastic-deterministic coupling method based on the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook
kinetic model. First, macroscopic synthetic equations are derived exactly from
the kinetic equation, which not only contain the Navier-Stokes-Fourier
constitutive relation, but also encompass the higher-order terms describing the
rarefaction effects. Then, the high-order terms are extracted from LVDSMC and
fed into synthetic equations to predict macroscopic properties which are closer
to the steady-state solution than LVDSMC. Finally, the state of simulation
particles in LVDSMC is updated to reflect the change of macroscopic properties.
As a result, the convergence to steady state is greatly accelerated, and the
restriction on cell size and the time step are removed: after simulating
several canonical rarefied gas flows, we demonstrate that the LVDSMC-GSIS
reduces the computational cost by two orders of magnitude in the near-continuum
flow regime.

form mesophases, in-between ordinary liquids and anisotropic crystals. At each
point, the molecules collectively orient themselves along a privileged
direction, which locally defines an orientational order. Sometimes, this order
is broken and singularities appear in the form of topological defects. This
tutorial article is dedicated to the geometry, topology and physics of these
defects. We introduce the main models used to describe the nematic phase and
discuss the isotropic-nematic phase transition. Then, we present the different
families of defects in nematics and examine some of their physical outcomes.
Finally, we show that topological defects are universal patterns of nature,
appearing not only in soft matter, but also in biology, cosmology, geology and

neutrality, the unbalanced resource production of intermittent wind and
photovoltaic (PV) power is a critical issue for peer-to-peer (P2P) power
trading. To address this issue, a reinforcement learning (RL) technique is
introduced in this paper. For RL, a graph convolutional network (GCN) and a
bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network are jointly applied to
P2P power trading between nanogrid clusters, based on cooperative game theory.
The flexible and reliable DC nanogrid is suitable for integrating renewable
energy for a distribution system. Each local nanogrid cluster takes the
position of prosumer, focusing on power production and consumption
simultaneously. For the power management of nanogrid cluster, multi-objective
optimization is applied to each local nanogrid cluster with the Internet of
Things (IoT) technology. Charging/discharging of an electric vehicle (EV) is
executed considering the intermittent characteristics of wind and PV power
production. RL algorithms, such as GCN- convolutional neural network (CNN)
layers for deep Q-learning network (DQN), GCN-LSTM layers for deep recurrent
Q-learning network (DRQN), GCN-Bi-LSTM layers for DRQN, and GCN-Bi-LSTM layers
for proximal policy optimization (PPO), are used for simulations. Consequently,
the cooperative P2P power trading system maximizes the profit by considering
the time of use (ToU) tariff-based electricity cost and the system marginal
price (SMP), and minimizes the amount of grid power consumption. Power
management of nanogrid clusters with P2P power trading is simulated on a
distribution test feeder in real time, and the proposed GCN-Bi-LSTM-PPO
technique achieving the lowest electricity cost among the RL algorithms used
for comparison reduces the electricity cost by 36.7%, averaging over nanogrid
clusters.

better closure and algorithmic properties. This state of affairs motivates the
study of intermediate forms of nondeterminism. Here, we investigate
history-deterministic Parikh automata, i.e., automata whose nondeterminism can

for applications which classically call for determinism, e.g., solving games

breakthrough bottlenecks in the understanding of luminescence mechanisms.
Unfortunately, long-standing disputes about the exciton recombination mechanism

nanocrystals (Si NCs) can realize fast direct-bandgap-like optical transitions.
Here, using ground-state and excited-state density functional theory (DFT), we
obtained intrinsic phonon-free optical transitions at sizes from Si22 to Si705,
showing that very small Si NCs can realize a strong direct optical transition.
Orbital labeling results show that this rapid transition does not come from the
{\Gamma}-{\Gamma} -like transition, contrary to the conclusions from the
effective mass approximation (EMA) and that {\Gamma}-X mixing leads to a
quasi-direct bandgap. This anomalous transition is particularly intense with
decreasing size (or enhancement of quantum confinement). By investigating
electron and hole distributions generated in the optical transition, localized
state-induced enhanced emission (LIEE) in Si NCs was proposed. Quantum
confinement (QC) distorts the excited-state electron spatial distribution by
localizing Bloch waves into the NC core, resulting in increased hole and
electron overlap, thus inducing a fast optical process. This work resolves
important debates and proposes LIEE to explain the anomalous luminescence--a
phase transition from weak (or none) luminescent state to strong optical
transition, which will aid attempts at realizing high-radiative-rate NCs
materials and application-level Si lasers.

Secondly, we consider individual psychological mechanism and introduce

Finally, the natural evolution coefficient of opinion is introduced to modify

show that the change of network structure cannot eliminate the echo chamber

down the echo chamber effect. Opinion leaders can aggregate opinions within

opinion leaders can change their opinions over time, they can well guide
opinions to converge to neutral opinions, thus achieving the purpose of

historical policies when training models. This opens questions regarding not

regarding the impact of different data collection protocols on the performance
of various policies trained on the data, or the robustness of policy
performance with respect to changes in problem characteristics such as action-

questions for the problem of optimizing sales channel allocations at LinkedIn,
where sales accounts (leads) need to be allocated to one of three channels,
with the goal of maximizing the number of successful conversions over a period
of time. A key problem feature constitutes the presence of stochastic delays in
observing allocation outcomes, whose distribution is both channel- and outcome-

functions or feedback loops that process perception outputs (e.g.,from object

input several example language commands (formatted as comments) followed by
corresponding policy code (via few-shot prompting), LLMs can take in new
commands and autonomously re-compose API calls to generate new policy code
respectively. By chaining classic logic structures and referencing third-party
libraries (e.g., NumPy, Shapely) to perform arithmetic, LLMs used in this way
can write robot policies that (i) exhibit spatial-geometric reasoning, (ii)
generalize to new instructions, and (iii) prescribe precise values (e.g.,

A previous study analyzing follow-up observation data obtained by Suzaku on 31
January to 3 February 2014 reported that an annular emission of ~3'-9' radius
was found around the transient source. The most plausible origin of the annular
emission is a dust scattering echo by the outburst of MAXI J1421-613. In this
paper, we confirm the annular emission by analyzing the data of the Swift
follow-up observation which was conducted by the photon counting mode on 18
January 2014. In a radial profile, we found an annular emission at ~2'.5-4'.5.
Its spectrum was well explained by an absorbed power law, and the photon index
was higher than that of MAXI J1421-613 itself by delta Gamma~2. The flux and
radius of the annular emission observed by Swift are explained by dust
scattering of the same outburst as is responsible for the annular emission
observed by Suzaku. Assuming that the dust layer causing the annular emission
found by Swift is located at the same position as the CO cloud in front of MAXI
J1421-613, the distance to the transient source was estimated to be ~3 kpc,
which is consistent with the value estimated by the previous study of Suzaku.

However, there are no studies so far that explain a possible theoretical

causes high-dimensional changes to cell phenotype. Here, we show that a
correlation exists between fitness change in stress tolerance evolution and

do not focus on situated commonsense reasoning under multiple possible
scenarios. This study frames this task by asking multiple questions with the
same set of possible endings as candidate answers, given a short story text.
Our resulting dataset, Possible Stories, consists of more than 4.5K questions
over 1.3K story texts in English. We discover that even current strong
pretrained language models struggle to answer the questions consistently,
highlighting that the highest accuracy in an unsupervised setting (60.2%) is
far behind human accuracy (92.5%). Through a comparison with existing datasets,
we observe that the questions in our dataset contain minimal annotation
artifacts in the answer options. In addition, our dataset includes examples
that require counterfactual reasoning, as well as those requiring readers'
reactions and fictional information, suggesting that our dataset can serve as a
challenging testbed for future studies on situated commonsense reasoning.

  Segmentation","NeurIPS2022 accepted",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generating precise class-aware pseudo ground-truths, a.k.a, class activation
maps (CAMs), is essential for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. The
original CAM method usually produces incomplete and inaccurate localization
maps. To tackle with this issue, this paper proposes an Expansion and Shrinkage
scheme based on the offset learning in the deformable convolution, to
sequentially improve the recall and precision of the located object in the two
respective stages. In the Expansion stage, an offset learning branch in a
deformable convolution layer, referred as ""expansion sampler"" seeks for
sampling increasingly less discriminative object regions, driven by an inverse
supervision signal that maximizes image-level classification loss. The located
more complete object in the Expansion stage is then gradually narrowed down to
the final object region during the Shrinkage stage. In the Shrinkage stage, the
offset learning branch of another deformable convolution layer, referred as
""shrinkage sampler"", is introduced to exclude the false positive background
regions attended in the Expansion stage to improve the precision of the
localization maps. We conduct various experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS
COCO 2014 to well demonstrate the superiority of our method over other
state-of-the-art methods for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. Code will

the sphere of radius $\|T\|$ centred at the origin in $Y^*$. This notion is
inspired by the quasi-norm attainment of operators introduced and studied in

approximating operator can be chosen with additional properties. This allows us
to distinguish the properties of weak-star quasi norm attaining operators from
those of quasi norm attaining operators. It is also shown that, under certain
conditions, weak-star quasi norm attaining operators share numbers of
equivalent properties with other types of norm attaining operators, but that
there are also a number of situations in which they behave differently from the
others.

$1.35\times 10^{28}$~yr. To reach this sensitivity, the design goal for nEXO is
$\leq$1\% energy resolution at the decay $Q$-value ($2458.07\pm 0.31$~keV).
Reaching this resolution requires the efficient collection of both the

or fewer labels, hoping to realize almost the same performance as fully
supervised approaches, which recently, have attracted extensive research
attention. A typical solution in this framework is to use self-training or
pseudo labeling to mine the supervision from the point cloud itself, but ignore
the critical information from images. In fact, cameras widely exist in LiDAR
scenarios and this complementary information seems to be greatly important for
3D applications. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modality weakly
supervised method for 3D segmentation, incorporating complementary information
from unlabeled images. Basically, we design a dual-branch network equipped with
an active labeling strategy, to maximize the power of tiny parts of labels and
directly realize 2D-to-3D knowledge transfer. Afterwards, we establish a
cross-modal self-training framework in an Expectation-Maximum (EM) perspective,
which iterates between pseudo labels estimation and parameters updating. In the
M-Step, we propose a cross-modal association learning to mine complementary
supervision from images by reinforcing the cycle-consistency between 3D points
and 2D superpixels. In the E-step, a pseudo label self-rectification mechanism
is derived to filter noise labels thus providing more accurate labels for the
networks to get fully trained. The extensive experimental results demonstrate
that our method even outperforms the state-of-the-art fully supervised

previous work concentrates on either spatial-discriminative features or
temporal-repetitive features, with little attention to the synergy between
spatial and temporal cues. To address this issue, we propose a
spatial-then-temporal self-supervised learning method. Specifically, we firstly
extract spatial features from unlabeled images via contrastive learning, and
secondly enhance the features by exploiting the temporal cues in unlabeled
videos via reconstructive learning. In the second step, we design a global
correlation distillation loss to ensure the learning not to forget the spatial
cues, and a local correlation distillation loss to combat the temporal
discontinuity that harms the reconstruction. The proposed method outperforms
the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, as established by the

paper, we address these issues by introducing a nonlinear disturbance observer

of the closed-loop multirotor system with an adaptive controller in augmented
state space using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis. Then, we derive a
closed-form expression that over-approximates the FRS as an ellipsoid, allowing
for real-time computation. By compensating for disturbances with the adaptive

over-approximations. Numerical examples validate the computational efficiency

combustor are investigated numerically at atmospheric pressure for pure CH4
fueling and for a CH4/H2 fuel blend in 24:1 mass ratio using Large Eddy
Simulation (LES). Pure CH4 fueling results in a turbulent propagating flame
anchored by the hot gas recirculation zone developed near the inlet of the
sequential combustion chamber. Conversely, CH4/H2 fueling results in a drastic
change of the combustion process, with multiple auto-ignition kernels produced
upstream of the main flame brush. Chemical Explosive Mode Analysis indicates
that, when H2 is added, flame stabilization in the combustion chamber is
strongly supported by auto-ignition chemistry. The analysis of fuel
decomposition pathways highlights that radicals advected from the first stage
flame, in particular OH, induce a rapid fuel decomposition and cause the
reactivity enhancement that leads to auto-ignition upstream of the sequential
flame. This behavior is promoted by the relatively large mass fraction of OH
radicals found in the flow reaching the second stage, which is approximately
one order of magnitude greater than it would be at chemical equilibrium. The
importance of the out-of-equilibrium vitiated air on the ignition behavior is
proven via an additional LES that features weak auto-ignition kernel formation
when equilibrium is artificially imposed. It is concluded, therefore, that
parameters affecting the relaxation towards chemical equilibrium of the
vitiated flow can have an important influence on the operability of sequential
combustors fueled with varying fractions of H2 blending.

infrared imaging, we investigate the droplet lifetime, breakup and boiling
modes, as well as the cooling performance of different substrates. The post
substrate leads to a shorter droplet lifetime and a 20{\deg}C higher
Leidenfrost temperature compared to a flat substrate, attributed to mixed
boiling modes along the height of the post and additional pinning. For
temperatures below the Leidenfrost point, in the nucleate boiling regime, the
post substrate also provides a larger maximum temperature drop than its flat
counterpart. The enhanced cooling capacity can be attributed to better droplet
pinning and an enlarged droplet-substrate contact area. The post's superior
cooling performance becomes especially clear for impact on an inclined surface,
where the post successfully prevents the rolling and bouncing of the droplet,
providing a 51% to 180% increase in the maximum local temperature drop.
Interestingly, at temperatures slightly above the Leidenfrost point and for a
relatively narrow range of Weber numbers, droplets on the post substrate
rebound rather than break up due to a complex interplay of inertial, capillary,
and bubble (thin film) dynamics. Overall, the findings show that a large-scale
structure increases the Leidenfrost temperature and enhances droplet breakup
and interfacial heat transfer efficiency during non-isothermal droplet impact.

centralizing losses with the dynamic prototype guidance to avoid these features
deviating from their belonging category clusters. To provide the more
challenging corrupted point clouds, we adversarially train a noise generator

another sub-optimal bounding box may be detected around the attacked bounding
box to be the new true positive one. To settle this challenge, we propose to
minimize the true positive rate and maximize the false positive rate, which can
encourage more false positive objects to block the generation of new true
positive bounding boxes. It is modeled as a multi-objective optimization (MOP)
problem, of which the generic algorithm can search the Pareto-optimal. However,
our task has more than two million decision variables, leading to low searching
efficiency. Thus, we extend the standard Genetic Algorithm with Random Subset

the efficiency. Moreover, to alleviate the sensitivity to population quality in
generic algorithms, we generate a gradient-prior initial population, utilizing
the transferability between different detectors with similar backbones.

loosely connected neural crest cells (NCCs) lead us to hypothesize that NCC
remodeling of an initially punctate ECM creates a scaffold for trailing cells,
enabling them to form robust and coherent stream patterns. We evaluate this
idea in a theoretical setting by developing an individual-based computational
model that incorporates reciprocal interactions between NCCs and their ECM. ECM
remodeling, haptotaxis, contact guidance, and cell-cell repulsion are
sufficient for cells to establish streams in silico, however additional
mechanisms, such as chemotaxis, are required to consistently guide cells along
the correct target corridor. Further model investigations imply that contact
guidance and differential cell-cell repulsion between leader and follower cells
are key contributors to robust collective cell migration by preventing stream
breakage. Global sensitivity analysis and simulated gain- and loss-of-function
experiments suggest that long-distance migration without jamming is most likely
to occur when leading cells specialize in creating ECM fibers, and trailing
cells specialize in responding to environmental cues by upregulating mechanisms
such as contact guidance.

A unique sample of luminous X-ray selected AGNs above $z>2$ was constructed by
matching the XMM-SERVS X-ray point-source catalog with a PSF-convolved
photometric catalog covering from $u^*$ to 4.5$\mu \mathrm{m}$ bands.
Photometric redshift, hydrogen column density, and 2-10 keV AGN luminosity of

absorption functions. The results suggest that $76_{-3}^{+4}\%$ of luminous
quasars ($\log L_X\ (\rm erg\ s^{-1}) >44.5$) above redshift 2 are obscured.

(or quantum) advantage for classifying supervised datasets (e.g., satellite
images) over some conventional deep learning (DL) techniques due to their
expressive power via their local effective dimension. There are, however, two
main challenges regardless of the promised quantum advantage: 1) Currently
available quantum bits (qubits) are very small in number, while real-world
datasets are characterized by hundreds of high-dimensional elements (i.e.,
features). Additionally, there is not a single unified approach for embedding
real-world high-dimensional datasets in a limited number of qubits. 2) Some
real-world datasets are too small for training intricate QML networks. Hence,
to tackle these two challenges for benchmarking and validating QML networks on
real-world, small, and high-dimensional datasets in one-go, we employ quantum
transfer learning composed of a multi-qubit QML network, and a very deep
convolutional network (a with VGG16 architecture) extracting informative
features from any small, high-dimensional dataset. We use real-amplitude and
strongly-entangling N-layer QML networks with and without data re-uploading
layers as a multi-qubit QML network, and evaluate their expressive power
quantified by using their local effective dimension; the lower the local
effective dimension of a QML network, the better its performance on unseen
data. Our numerical results show that the strongly-entangling N-layer QML
network has a lower local effective dimension than the real-amplitude QML
network and outperforms it on the hard-to-classify three-class labelling
problem. In addition, quantum transfer learning helps tackle the two challenges
mentioned above for benchmarking and validating QML networks on real-world,
small, and high-dimensional datasets.

mortality prediction for COVID-19 patients in intensive care units using
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Despite their initial success in certain

achieve a fair comparison so that we can select the optimal model for clinical

length-of-stay prediction and Early mortality prediction for COVID-19 patients

length-of-stay and mortality prediction tasks to accommodate the clinical

on two tasks, including 5 machine learning models, 6 basic deep learning models

provide benchmarking results using data from two real-world COVID-19 EHR

contrastive learning can lead to powerful point-wise features, the learned
correspondences commonly lack smoothness and consistency, owing to the purely
combinatorial nature of the standard contrastive losses. To overcome this

highly discriminative across individual points, and, at the same time, lead to
robust and consistent correspondences, through simple proximity queries. Our
framework is general and is applicable to local feature learning in both the 3D

individuals (nodes). Since relational data are often sensitive, there is an
urgent need to evaluate the privacy risks in graph data. One famous privacy
attack against data analysis models is the model inversion attack, which aims
to infer sensitive data in the training dataset and leads to great privacy
concerns. Despite its success in grid-like domains, directly applying model
inversion attacks on non-grid domains such as graph leads to poor attack
performance. This is mainly due to the failure to consider the unique
properties of graphs. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic study on
model inversion attacks against Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), one of the
state-of-the-art graph analysis tools in this paper. Firstly, in the white-box
setting where the attacker has full access to the target GNN model, we present
GraphMI to infer the private training graph data. Specifically, in GraphMI, a
projected gradient module is proposed to tackle the discreteness of graph edges
and preserve the sparsity and smoothness of graph features; a graph
auto-encoder module is used to efficiently exploit graph topology, node
attributes, and target model parameters for edge inference; a random sampling
module can finally sample discrete edges. Furthermore, in the hard-label
black-box setting where the attacker can only query the GNN API and receive the
classification results, we propose two methods based on gradient estimation and
reinforcement learning (RL-GraphMI). Our experimental results show that such
defenses are not sufficiently effective and call for more advanced defenses

consistency and local cross-view complementarity preserving regularization to
comprehensively learn representations from multiple views. On the global stage,
we reckon that the crucial knowledge is implicitly shared among views, and
enhancing the encoder to capture such knowledge from data can improve the
discriminability of the learned representations. Hence, preserving the global
consistency of multiple views ensures the acquisition of common knowledge.
CoCoNet aligns the probabilistic distribution of views by utilizing an
efficient discrepancy metric measurement based on the generalized sliced
Wasserstein distance. Lastly on the local stage, we propose a heuristic
complementarity-factor, which joints cross-view discriminative knowledge, and
it guides the encoders to learn not only view-wise discriminability but also
cross-view complementary information. Theoretically, we provide the
information-theoretical-based analyses of our proposed CoCoNet. Empirically, to
investigate the improvement gains of our approach, we conduct adequate
experimental validations, which demonstrate that CoCoNet outperforms the

nucleated by the quasi-static growth of localized slip patches. After reaching
a certain critical size, these patches become unstable and continue growing
dynamically, eventually causing the sliding of the entire interface. Two
different theories have been used to compute the nucleation length of such
patches depending on the dominant process driving their growth. If it is only
the yielding of contact asperities (large-scale yielding), a stress criterion
is applied, based on linear stability analysis, whereas if fracture dominates,
an energy criterion is applied, based on fracture mechanics and classical
nucleation theory. Both approaches contain important underlying assumptions
that are well-suited to describe either one situation or the other. However,
what happens in-between is not captured by any of them. In this work, we use
numerical simulations to study what is the dominant underlying process driving
nucleation for different conditions of heterogeneity and what are the
implications for nucleation dynamics and the onset of frictional sliding. We
show that large frictional heterogeneities enable a transition from a
yielding-driven nucleation phase to a fracture-driven one. This transition
occurs only above a certain level of heterogeneity and can either be
quasi-static (stable) or dynamic (unstable), depending on the correlation
length of frictional strength along the interface and the difference in
strength between the strongest and the weakest point (the amplitude). Unstable
transitions generate localized dynamic slip events, whose magnitude increases
with higher correlation length and decreases with larger amplitude. Our work
sheds new light on the role of heterogeneity and fracture in the nucleation of
frictional slip, bridging the gap between the two main governing theories for
nucleation.

following properties via some appropriate design of the computation and payment

it is important to learn both representation of neighboring nodes, i.e.,

methods have been developed for this goal. However, most of the existing
pooling methods utilize k-hop neighborhood without considering explicit
structural information in a graph. In this paper, we propose Structure
Prototype Guided Pooling (SPGP) that utilizes prior graph structures to
overcome the limitation. SPGP formulates graph structures as learnable
prototype vectors and computes the affinity between nodes and prototype

properly, it is necessary to make a prototype. The prototype consists of 5
(steps): 1) Quick plan, 2) Modeling Quick Design, 3) Construction of prototype,
4) Deployment Delivery & feedback, and 5) Communication. In this research, the
InVision design tool is used which can help design prototypes for both mobile

nuclear systems. As the number of particles in a many-body system increases,
the size of the space if the associated Hamiltonian increases exponentially.
This presents a challenge when performing calculations on large systems when
using classical computing methods. By using a quantum computer, one may be able
to overcome this difficulty thanks to the exponential way the Hilbert space of
a quantum computer grows with the number of quantum bits (qubits). Our aim is
to develop quantum computing algorithms which can reproduce and predict nuclear
structure such as level schemes and level densities. As a sample Hamiltonian,
we use the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. We use an efficient encoding of the
Hamiltonian onto many-qubit systems, and have developed an algorithm allowing
the full excitation spectrum of a nucleus to be determined with a variational
algorithm capable of implementation on today's quantum computers with a limited
number of qubits. Our algorithm uses the variance of the Hamiltonian, $\langle
H^2\rangle - \langle H\rangle ^2$, as a cost function for the widely-used
variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). In this work we present a variance based
method of finding the excited state spectrum of a small nuclear system using a

This constrained formulation includes consensus or single-task optimization as

multitask smoothness and coupled optimization. In order to cope with
communication constraints, we propose and study an adaptive decentralized
strategy where the agents employ differential randomized quantizers to compress
their estimates before communicating with their neighbors. The analysis shows
that, under some general conditions on the quantization noise, and for
sufficiently small step-sizes $\mu$, the strategy is stable both in terms of
mean-square error and average bit rate: by reducing $\mu$, it is possible to
keep the estimation errors small (on the order of $\mu$) without increasing
indefinitely the bit rate as $\mu\rightarrow 0$. Simulations illustrate the
theoretical findings and the effectiveness of the proposed approach, revealing
that decentralized learning is achievable at the expense of only a few bits.

method for reconstructing material models from measured wave signals. In the
field of seismic exploration, FWI has proven particularly successful in the
reconstruction of smoothly varying material deviations. In contrast,
non-destructive testing (NDT) often requires the detection and specification of
sharp defects in a specimen. If the contrast between materials is low, FWI can
be successfully applied to these problems as well. However, so far the method
is not fully suitable to image defects such as voids, which are characterized
by a high contrast in the material parameters. In this paper, we introduce a
dimensionless scaling function $\gamma$ to model voids in the forward and
inverse scalar wave equation problem. Depending on which material parameters
this function $\gamma$ scales, different modeling approaches are presented,
leading to three formulations of mono-parameter FWI and one formulation of
two-parameter FWI. The resulting problems are solved by first-order
optimization, where the gradient is computed by an ajdoint state method. The
corresponding Fr\'echet kernels are derived for each approach and the
associated minimization is performed using an L-BFGS algorithm. A comparison
between the different approaches shows that scaling the density with $\gamma$
is most promising for parameterizing voids in the forward and inverse problem.
Finally, in order to consider arbitrary complex geometries known a priori, this
approach is combined with an immersed boundary method, the finite cell method
(FCM).

labels as supervision, highly rely on the initial class activation map (CAM)
generated from the standard classification network. In this paper, a novel
""Progressive Patch Learning"" approach is proposed to improve the local details
extraction of the classification, producing the CAM better covering the whole
object rather than only the most discriminative regions as in CAMs obtained in
conventional classification models. ""Patch Learning"" destructs the feature maps
into patches and independently processes each local patch in parallel before
the final aggregation. Such a mechanism enforces the network to find weak
information from the scattered discriminative local parts, achieving enhanced
local details sensitivity. ""Progressive Patch Learning"" further extends the
feature destruction and patch learning to multi-level granularities in a
progressive manner. Cooperating with a multi-stage optimization strategy, such
a ""Progressive Patch Learning"" mechanism implicitly provides the model with the
feature extraction ability across different locality-granularities. As an
alternative to the implicit multi-granularity progressive fusion approach, we
additionally propose an explicit method to simultaneously fuse features from
different granularities in a single model, further enhancing the CAM quality on
the full object coverage. Our proposed method achieves outstanding performance
on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset e.g., with 69.6$% mIoU on the test set), which

model overpredicts the necessary argon concentrations for LFS divertor
detachment by about a factor of 5-10 relative to the SOLPS-ITER simulations.
Therefore, while the Lengyel model predicts that plasmas with accetable
divertor heat loads in EU-DEMO would exceed the tolerable upstream impurity
concentrations by a large margin, there are several SOLPS-ITER solutions within
an acceptable operational space. The SOLPS-ITER simulations indicate that,
unlike assumed by the standard Lengyel model, there are significant heat
dissipation mechanisms other than argon radiation, such as cross-field
transport, that reduce the role of argon radiation by a factor of 2 to 3.
Furthermore, the Lengyel model assumes that the radiation front is powered by
parallel heat conduction only, which tends to lead to a narrow radiation front
as the radiative efficiency increases strongly with reducing thermal
conductivity. As a result, the radiative volume and total impurity radiation
are suppressed for a given impurity concentration. However, the SOLPS-ITER
simulations indicate that other mechanisms, such as cross-field transport, can
compete with parallel heat conduction within the radiative front and increase
the radiative volume. Due to these findings, usage of the standard Lengyel
model for analyzing scaling between divertor conditions and configurations for
devices such as EU-DEMO is strongly discouraged.

While the need for biomedical fact-checking has been recognized in recent

At the same time, models for other text genres might not be reusable, because
the claims they have been trained with are substantially different. For
instance, claims in the SciFact dataset are short and focused: ""Side effects
associated with antidepressants increases risk of stroke"". In contrast, social
media holds naturally-occurring claims, often embedded in additional context:
""`If you take antidepressants like SSRIs, you could be at risk of a condition
called serotonin syndrome' Serotonin syndrome nearly killed me in 2010. Had
symptoms of stroke and seizure."" This showcases the mismatch between real-world
medical claims and the input that existing fact-checking systems expect. To
make user-generated content checkable by existing models, we propose to
reformulate the social-media input in such a way that the resulting claim

our method condenses the claim with the help of relational entity information

extracts the shortest phrase that contains these elements. We show that the

  Detection",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is the key to deploying models safely in
the open world. For OOD detection, collecting sufficient in-distribution (ID)
labeled data is usually more time-consuming and costly than unlabeled data.
When ID labeled data is limited, the previous OOD detection methods are no
longer superior due to their high dependence on the amount of ID labeled data.
Based on limited ID labeled data and sufficient unlabeled data, we define a new
setting called Weakly-Supervised Out-of-Distribution Detection (WSOOD). To
solve the new problem, we propose an effective method called Topological
Structure Learning (TSL). Firstly, TSL uses a contrastive learning method to
build the initial topological structure space for ID and OOD data. Secondly,
TSL mines effective topological connections in the initial topological space.
Finally, based on limited ID labeled data and mined topological connections,
TSL reconstructs the topological structure in a new topological space to
increase the separability of ID and OOD instances. Extensive studies on several
representative datasets show that TSL remarkably outperforms the
state-of-the-art, verifying the validity and robustness of our method in the
new setting of WSOOD.

attractive for different industrial sectors. In this work, the influence of
mechanical properties on the notch fracture resistance of Ti-6Al-4V produced by
Selective Laser Melting is numerically investigated. Literature data is used to
inform material behaviour. The as-built brittle behaviour is compared to the
enhanced ductile response after heat treatment (HT) and hot isostatic pressing
(HIP) post-processes. A Phase Field framework is adopted to capture damage
nucleation and propagation from two different notch geometries and a discussion
on the influence of fracture energy and the characteristic length is carried
out. In addition, the influence of oxygen uptake is analysed by reproducing
non-inert atmospheres during HT and HIP, showing that oxygen shifts fracture to
brittle failures due to the formation of an alpha case layer, especially for
the V-notch geometry. Results show that a pure elastic behaviour can be assumed
for the as-built SLM condition, whereas elastic-plastic phenomena must be
modelled for specimens subjected to heat treatment or hot isostatic pressing.
The present brittle Phase Field framework coupled with an elastic-plastic
constitutive analysis is demonstrated to be a robust prediction tool for notch
fracture after different post-processing routes.

ambiguity is a typical feature of many medical image labels. It can be caused
by many factors, such as the imaging properties, pathological anatomy, and the
weak representation of the binary masks, which brings challenges to accurate 3D

generated by image matting to characterize lesions can provide rich semantic

comprehensively, and thus benefit the subsequent diagnoses and analyses. In
this work, we introduce image matting into the 3D scenes to describe the
lesions in 3D medical images. The study of image matting in 3D modality is

adapt the four selected state-of-the-art 2D image matting algorithms to 3D

Nevertheless, in set theory we may define an explicit association of definable

to realize Frege's Basic Law V as a ZF theorem scheme, Russell notwithstanding.
A similar analysis applies to the Cantor-Hume principle and to Fregean

definable, they provide a deflationary account of Fregean abstraction, one
expressible in and reducible to set theory -- every assertion in the language
of set theory allowing the extension and abstraction operators $\varepsilon F$,

thus sidesteps Russell's argument, which is revealed not as a refutation of

contraction through low-energy electrical signals. FES can animate paralysed
limbs. Yet, an open challenge remains on how to apply FES to achieve desired
movements. This challenge is accentuated by the complexities of human bodies
and the non-stationarities of the muscles' responses. The former causes
difficulties in performing inverse dynamics, and the latter causes control
performance to degrade over extended periods of use. Here, we engage the
challenge via a data-driven approach. Specifically, we learn to control FES
through Reinforcement Learning (RL) which can automatically customise the
stimulation for the patients. However, RL typically has Markovian assumptions
while FES control systems are non-Markovian because of the non-stationarities.
To deal with this problem, we use a recurrent neural network to create
Markovian state representations. We cast FES controls into RL problems and
train RL agents to control FES in different settings in both simulations and
the real world. The results show that our RL controllers can maintain control
performances over long periods and have better stimulation characteristics than
PID controllers.

challenging due to the strong astrophysical foregrounds, ionospheric effects,
radio frequency interference and instrumental effects. Understanding and
calibrating these effects are crucial for the detection. In this work, we
introduce a newly developed direction-dependent (DD) calibration algorithm
DDECAL and compare its performance with an existing algorithm, SAGECAL, in the
context of the LOFAR-EoR 21-cm power spectrum experiment. In our data set, the
North Celestial Pole (NCP) and its flanking fields were observed
simultaneously. We analyse the NCP and one of its flanking fields. The NCP
field is calibrated by the standard pipeline, using SAGECAL with an extensive
sky model and 122 directions, and the flanking field is calibrated by DDECAL
and SAGECAL with a simpler sky model and 22 directions. Additionally, two
strategies are used for subtracting Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A. The results show
that DDECAL performs better at subtracting sources in the primary beam region
due to the application of a beam model, while SAGECAL performs better at
subtracting Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A. This indicates that including a beam
model during DD calibration significantly improves the performance. The benefit
is obvious in the primary beam region. We also compare the 21-cm power spectra
on two different fields. The results show that the flanking field produces
better upper limits compared to the NCP in this particular observation. Despite
the minor differences between DDECAL and SAGECAL due to the beam application,
we find that the two algorithms yield comparable 21-cm power spectra on the
LOFAR-EoR data after foreground removal. Hence, the current LOFAR-EoR 21-cm
power spectrum limits are not likely to depend on the DD calibration method.

applications. This paper proposes an attention-based graph model named GATraj
with a much higher prediction speed. Spatial-temporal dynamics of agents, e.g.,
pedestrians or vehicles, are modeled by attention mechanisms. Interactions
among agents are modeled by a graph convolutional network. We also implement a
Laplacian mixture decoder to mitigate mode collapse and generate diverse
multimodal predictions for each agent. Our model achieves performance on par
with the state-of-the-art models at a much higher prediction speed tested on
multiple open datasets.

  Augmentation",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Connectivity augmentation problems are among the most elementary questions in
Network Design. Many of these problems admit natural $2$-approximation
algorithms, often through various classic techniques, whereas it remains open
whether approximation factors below $2$ can be achieved. One of the most basic
examples thereof is the Weighted Connectivity Augmentation Problem (WCAP). In
WCAP, one is given an undirected graph together with a set of additional
weighted candidate edges, and the task is to find a cheapest set of candidate
edges whose addition to the graph increases its edge-connectivity. We present a
$(1.5+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for WCAP, showing for the first
time that factors below $2$ are achievable.
  On a high level, we design a well-chosen local search algorithm, inspired by
recent advances for Weighted Tree Augmentation. To measure progress, we
consider a directed weakening of WCAP and show that it has highly structured
planar solutions. Interpreting a solution of the original problem as one of
this directed weakening allows us to describe local exchange steps in a clean
and algorithmically amenable way. Leveraging these insights, we show that we
can efficiently search for good exchange steps within a component class for
link sets that is closely related to bounded treewidth subgraphs of circle
graphs. Moreover, we prove that an optimum solution can be decomposed into
smaller components, at least one of which leads to a good local search step as
long as we did not yet achieve the claimed approximation guarantee.

this language. The tension between time-symmetry and time-asymmetry is then
captured by the tension between two of the key structures that are used in this

asymmetry is captured by a condition involving discarding which, ultimately, is
responsible for the theory being compatible with relativistic causality.
  Next we consider three different ways in which we this tension can be
resolved. The first of these is closely related to recent work of Lucien Hardy,
where the tension is resolved by adding in a time reversed version of
discarding together with a suitable consistency condition. The second is, to
our knowledge, a new approach. Here the tension is resolved by adding in new
systems which propagate backwards in time, and imposing a consistency condition
to avoid running into well known time-travel paradoxes. The final approach that
we explore is closely related to work of Oreshkov and Cerf, where the tension
is resolved by removing the constraint associated with discarding. We show two
equivalent ways in which this can be done whilst ensuring that the resulting
theory still makes sensible operational predictions.

utilize machine learning algorithms including deep learning models to detect
system anomalies. These anomalies are often identified as violations of
quantitative relational patterns or sequential patterns of log events in log

research. Based on the 2-norm of dual quaternion vectors, we propose a new dual
quaternion optimization method for the hand-eye calibration problem. The dual
quaternion optimization problem is decomposed to two quaternion optimization
subproblems. The first quaternion optimization subproblem governs the rotation
of the robot hand. It can be solved efficiently by the eigenvalue decomposition
or singular value decomposition. If the optimal value of the first quaternion
optimization subproblem is zero, then the system is rotationwise noiseless,
i.e., there exists a ``perfect'' robot hand motion which meets all the testing
poses rotationwise exactly. In this case, we apply the regularization technique
for solving the second subproblem to minimize the distance of the translation.
Otherwise we apply the patching technique to solve the second quaternion
optimization subproblem. Then solving the second quaternion optimization
subproblem turns out to be solving a quadratically constrained quadratic
program. In this way, we give a complete description for the solution set of
hand-eye calibration problems. This is new in the hand-eye calibration
literature. The numerical results are also presented to show the efficiency of
the proposed method.

location of the sinkage of heavier grains at the top layer is triggered with
certain randomness in the flat-bottom container, whereas it first occurs at
either of the lateral edges of the bottom in the circular-bottom container. The
quantified segregation factors in simulations show that the transition from the
RBNE segregation state to the BNE segregation state happens faster in the
circular-bottom container than that in the flat-bottom container. The
occurrence of standing-wave resonant spots of higher and lower granular
temperature accelerates the RBNE-BNE segregation inversion. From the elastic
collision model of single grain, the bottom with a larger angle leads to more
energy transfer from the vertical direction to the horizontal direction. The
theoretical predictions are confirmed by the simulations of a monodisperse
granular bed. The flat-bottom container has a uniform distribution with a
standing-wave period of granular temperature and packing density, whereas the
circular-bottom container possesses a higher granular temperature in the
horizontal direction and a lower packing density at the lateral edges of the

bias mitigation may leave a gap between intrinsic properties and the underlying

suggest extending bias mitigation into feature space. Therefore, a novel model,
Recovering Intended-Feature Subspace with Knowledge-Free (RISK) is developed.
Assuming that shortcut features caused by various biases are unintended for
prediction, RISK views them as redundant features. When delving into a lower

scenarios, since it could generate the predicted control sequence only relying
on the historical input and output data. Recently, based on cloud computing,
data-driven predictive cloud control system (DPCCS) has been proposed with the
advantage of sufficient computational resources. However, the existing
computation mode of DPCCS is centralized. This computation mode could not
utilize fully the computing power of cloud computing, of which the structure is
distributed. Thus, the computation delay could not been reduced and still
affects the control quality. In this paper, a novel cloud-edge collaborative
containerised workflow-based DPC system with disturbance observer (DOB) is
proposed, to improve the computation efficiency and guarantee the control
accuracy. First, a construction method for the DPC workflow is designed, to
match the distributed processing environment of cloud computing. But the
non-computation overheads of the workflow tasks are relatively high. Therefore,
a cloud-edge collaborative control scheme with DOB is designed. The low-weight
data could be truncated to reduce the non-computation overheads. Meanwhile, we
design an edge DOB to estimate and compensate the uncertainty in cloud workflow
processing, and obtain the composite control variable. The UUB stability of the
DOB is also proved. Third, to execute the workflow-based DPC controller and
evaluate the proposed cloud-edge collaborative control scheme with DOB in the
real cloud environment, we design and implement a practical workflow-based
cloud control experimental system based on container technology. Finally, a
series of evaluations show that, the computation times are decreased by 45.19%
and 74.35% for two real-time control examples, respectively, and by at most
85.10% for a high-dimension control example.

halo. Using this sample, the metallicity distribution function (MDF) as a
function of $r$ and the velocity anisotropy parameter $\beta$ profiles (for
different metallicity populations) are derived for the stellar halo. Both the
chemical and kinematic results suggest that the Galactic halo is composed of
two distinct parts, the inner halo and outer halo. The cutoff radius ($\sim$ 30
kpc) is similar to the previous break radius found in the density distribution
of the stellar halo. We find that the inner part is dominated by a metal-rich
population with extremely radial anisotropy ($\beta \sim 0.9$). These features
are in accordance with those of ``{\it Gaia}-Enceladus-Sausage'' (GES) and we
attribute this inner halo component as being dominantly composed of stars
deposited from this ancient merged satellite. We find that GES probably has a
slightly negative metallicity gradient. The metal-poor populations in the inner
halo are characterized as a long-tail in MDF with an anisotropy of $\beta \sim
0.5$, which is similar to that of the outer part. The MDF for the outer halo is
very broad with several weak peaks and the value of $\beta$ is around 0.5 for
all metallicities.

techniques exist for estimating light spectra out of multispectral images by
exploiting properties about the spectrum. Unfortunately, especially when
capturing multispectral videos, the images are heavily affected by noise due to
the nature of limited exposure times in videos. Therefore, models that
explicitly try to lower the influence of noise on the reconstructed spectrum
are highly desirable. Hence, a novel reconstruction algorithm is presented.
This novel estimation method is based on the guided filtering technique which
preserves basic structures, while using spatial information to reduce the
influence of noise. The evaluation based on spectra of natural images reveals
that this new technique yields better quantitative and subjective results in

Specifically, the proposed algorithm lowers the mean squared error and the

even more bands, for example in the infrared and ultraviolet area of the light

disadvantages like not being able to record videos. Therefore, multispectral
cameras with wide-band filters are used, which are much cheaper and are often
able to capture videos. However, using multispectral cameras requires an
additional reconstruction step to yield spectral information. Usually, this
reconstruction step has to be done in the presence of imaging noise, which
degrades the reconstructed spectra severely. Typically, same or similar pixels
are found across the image with the advantage of having independent noise. In
contrast to state-of-the-art spectral reconstruction methods which only exploit
neighboring pixels by block-based processing, this paper introduces non-local
filtering in spectral reconstruction. First, a block-matching procedure finds
similar non-local multispectral blocks. Thereafter, the hyperspectral pixels
are reconstructed by filtering the matched multispectral pixels collaboratively
using a reconstruction Wiener filter. The proposed novel procedure even works
under very strong noise. The method is able to lower the spectral angle up to

its spinodal temperature, around 573 K for water. Here, we employ molecular
dynamics simulations to show that nanoscale boiling is an heterogenous

solid surface is weakly wetting water. In addition, we show that boiling is a
slow process controlled by the solid-liquid interfacial thermal conductance,
which turns out to decrease significantly prior to phase change yielding long

dimensional redundancy and dimensional confounder are the intrinsic issues
behind the phenomena, and provide experimental evidence to support our
viewpoint. We further propose a simple yet effective approach MetaMask, short
for the dimensional Mask learned by Meta-learning, to learn representations
against dimensional redundancy and confounder. MetaMask adopts the
redundancy-reduction technique to tackle the dimensional redundancy issue and
innovatively introduces a dimensional mask to reduce the gradient effects of
specific dimensions containing the confounder, which is trained by employing a
meta-learning paradigm with the objective of improving the performance of
masked representations on a typical self-supervised task. We provide solid
theoretical analyses to prove MetaMask can obtain tighter risk bounds for
downstream classification compared to typical contrastive methods. Empirically,
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.

information learned from a labeled source domain to facilitate the

typically jointly trained on data from both domains, accessing the labeled
source domain data is often restricted, due to concerns over patient data
privacy or intellectual property. To sidestep this, we propose ""off-the-shelf

trained in a source domain to a target domain, in the absence of source domain

normalization (BN) statistics adaptation framework. In particular, we gradually
adapt the domain-specific low-order BN statistics, e.g., mean and variance,
through an exponential momentum decay strategy, while explicitly enforcing the
consistency of the domain shareable high-order BN statistics, e.g., scaling and
shifting factors, via our optimization objective. We also adaptively quantify
the channel-wise transferability to gauge the importance of each channel, via
both low-order statistics divergence and a scaling factor.~Furthermore, we
incorporate unsupervised self-entropy minimization into our framework to boost
performance alongside a novel queued, memory-consistent self-training strategy
to utilize the reliable pseudo label for stable and efficient unsupervised
adaptation. We evaluated our OSUDA-based framework on both cross-modality and
cross-subtype brain tumor segmentation and cardiac MR to CT segmentation tasks.

cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, and the energy scale for the emergence of
cosmological classicality. The fact that $\Lambda$ and unimodular time are
complementary quantum variables implies a perennially quantum Universe should
$\Lambda$ be zero (or, indeed, fixed at any value). Likewise, the smallness of
$\Lambda$ puts an upper bound on its uncertainty, and so a lower bound on the
unimodular clock's uncertainty or the cosmic time for the emergence of
classicality. Far from being the Planck scale, classicality arises at around $7
\times 10^{11}$ GeV for the observed $\Lambda$, and taking the region of
classicality to be our Hubble volume. We confirm this argument with a direct
evaluation of the wavefunction of the Universe in the connection representation
for unimodular theory. Our argument is robust, with the only leeway being in
the comoving volume of our cosmological classical patch, which should be bigger
than that of the observed last scattering surface. Should it be taken to be the
whole of a closed Universe, then the constraint depends weakly on $\Omega_k$:
for $-\Omega_k < 10^{-3}$ classicality is reached at $ > 4 \times 10^{12}$ GeV.
If it is infinite, then this energy scale is infinite, and the Universe is
always classical within the minisuperspace approximation. It is a remarkable
coincidence that the only way to render the Universe classical just below the
Planck scale is to define the size of the classical patch as the scale of
non-linearity for a red spectrum with the observed spectral index $n_s =
0.967(4)$ (about $10^{11}$ times the size of the current Hubble volume). In the
context of holographic cosmology, we may interpret this size as the scale of
confinement in the dual 3D quantum field theory, which may be probed (directly
or indirectly) with future cosmological surveys.

dynamic and complex. Besides, risky and non-risky traffic agents can be similar
in their appearance. These make risky object localization in the driving video
particularly challenging. To this end, this paper proposes an attention-guided
multistream feature fusion network (AM-Net) to localize dangerous traffic
agents from dashcam videos. Two Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks use object
bounding box and optical flow features extracted from consecutive video frames
to capture spatio-temporal cues for distinguishing dangerous traffic agents. An
attention module coupled with the GRUs learns to attend to the traffic agents
relevant to an accident. Fusing the two streams of features, AM-Net predicts
the riskiness scores of traffic agents in the video. In supporting this study,
the paper also introduces a benchmark dataset called Risky Object Localization
(ROL). The dataset contains spatial, temporal, and categorical annotations with
the accident, object, and scene-level attributes. The proposed AM-Net achieves
a promising performance of 85.73% AUC on the ROL dataset. Meanwhile, the AM-Net
outperforms current state-of-the-art for video anomaly detection by 6.3% AUC on
the DoTA dataset. A thorough ablation study further reveals AM-Net's merits by
evaluating the contributions of its different components.

To be published in ECCV 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In video analysis, background models have many applications such as
background/foreground separation, change detection, anomaly detection,
tracking, and more. However, while learning such a model in a video captured by
a static camera is a fairly-solved task, in the case of a Moving-camera
Background Model (MCBM), the success has been far more modest due to
algorithmic and scalability challenges that arise due to the camera motion.
Thus, existing MCBMs are limited in their scope and their supported
camera-motion types. These hurdles also impeded the employment, in this
unsupervised task, of end-to-end solutions based on deep learning (DL).
Moreover, existing MCBMs usually model the background either on the domain of a
typically-large panoramic image or in an online fashion. Unfortunately, the
former creates several problems, including poor scalability, while the latter
prevents the recognition and leveraging of cases where the camera revisits
previously-seen parts of the scene. This paper proposes a new method, called
DeepMCBM, that eliminates all the aforementioned issues and achieves
state-of-the-art results. Concretely, first we identify the difficulties
associated with joint alignment of video frames in general and in a DL setting
in particular. Next, we propose a new strategy for joint alignment that lets us
use a spatial transformer net with neither a regularization nor any form of
specialized (and non-differentiable) initialization. Coupled with an
autoencoder conditioned on unwarped robust central moments (obtained from the
joint alignment), this yields an end-to-end regularization-free MCBM that
supports a broad range of camera motions and scales gracefully. We demonstrate
DeepMCBM's utility on a variety of videos, including ones beyond the scope of
other methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/DeepMCBM .

enables recording topographic images in the absence of any component of the
electrostatic force. Our approach is based on a close loop z-spectroscopy
operated in data cube mode. Curves of the tip-sample distance as a function of
time are recorded onto a 2D grid. A dedicated circuit holds the KPFM
compensation bias and subsequently cut off the modulation voltage during
well-defined time-windows within the spectroscopic acquisition. Topographic
images are recalculated from the matrix of spectroscopic curves. This approach
is applied to the case of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) monolayers
grown by chemical vapour deposition on silicon oxide substrates. In addition,
we check to what extent a proper stacking height estimation can also be
performed by recording series of images for decreasing values of the bias
modulation amplitude. The outputs of both approaches are shown to be fully
consistent. The results exemplify how in the operating conditions of
non-contact AFM under ultra-high vacuum, the stacking height values can
dramatically be overestimated due to variations in the tip-surface capacitive
gradient, even though the KPFM controller nullifies the potential difference.
We show that the number of atomic layers of a TMD can be safely assessed, only
if the KPFM measurement is performed with a modulated bias amplitude reduced at
its strict minimum or, even better, without any modulated bias. Last, the
spectroscopic data reveal that defects at the TMD/oxide interface can have a
counterintuitive impact on the electrostatic landscape, resulting in an
apparent decrease of the measured stacking height by conventional nc-AFM/KPFM
compared to non-defective sample areas. Hence, electrostatic free z-imaging
proves to be a promising tool to assess the existence of defects in atomically
thin TMD layers grown on oxides

have well constrained the demographics of disks, such as their millimetre
luminosities, spectral indices, and disk radii. Additionally, several
high-resolution observations have revealed an abundance of substructures in the
disks dust continuum. The most prominent are ring like structures, likely due
to pressure bumps trapping dust particles. The origins and characteristics of
these bumps, nevertheless, need to be further investigated. The purpose of this
work is to study how dynamic pressure bumps affect observational properties of
protoplanetary disks. We further aim to differentiate between the planetary-
versus zonal flow-origin of pressure bumps. We perform one-dimensional gas and
dust evolution simulations, setting up models with varying pressure bump
features. We subsequently run radiative transfer calculations to obtain
synthetic images and the different quantities of observations. We find that the
outermost pressure bump determines the disks dust size across different
millimetre wavelengths. Our modelled dust traps need to form early (< 0.1 Myr),
fast (on viscous timescales), and must be long lived (> Myr) to obtain the
observed high millimetre luminosities and low spectral indices of disks. While
the planetary bump models can reproduce these observables irrespectively of the
opacity prescription, the highest opacities are needed for the zonal flow bump
model to be in line with observations. Our findings favour the planetary- over
the zonal flow-origin of pressure bumps and support the idea that planet
formation already occurs in early class 0-1 stages of circumstellar disks. The
determination of the disks effective size through its outermost pressure bump
also delivers a possible answer to why disks in recent low-resolution surveys
appear to have the same sizes across different millimetre wavelengths.

a commensurate charge density wave (CCDW) at temperatures below 165~K where it
also becomes insulating. The low temperature CCDW phase can be driven into a
metastable ""mosaic"" phase by means of either laser or voltage pulses which
shows a large density of CDW domain walls as well as a closing of the
electronic band gap. The exact origins of this pulse-induced metallic mosaic
are not yet fully understood. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy and
spectroscopy (STM/STS), we observe the occurrence of such a metallic mosaic
phase on the surface of TaS$_2$ without prior pulse excitation over continuous
areas larger than $100 \times 100$~nm$^2$ and macroscopic areas on the
millimetre scale. We attribute the appearance of the mosaic phase to the
presence of surface defects which cause the formation of the characteristic
dense domain wall network. Based on our STM measurements, we further argue how
the appearance of the metallic behaviour in the mosaic phase could be explained
by local stacking differences of the top layer. Thus, we provide a potential
avenue to explain the origin of the pulse induced mosaic phase.

in which external inputs can alter the evolving states of a system. These
paradigms are used in information processing, machine learning, and
computation. A fundamental question that needs to be addressed in this
framework is the statistical relationship between the input and the system
states. This paper provides conditions that guarantee the existence and
uniqueness of asymptotically invariant measures for driven systems and shows
that their dependence on the input process is continuous when the set of input
and output processes are endowed with the Wasserstein distance. The main tool
in these developments is the characterization of those invariant measures as
fixed points of naturally defined Foias operators that appear in this context
and which have been profusely studied in the paper. Those fixed points are
obtained by imposing a newly introduced stochastic state contractivity on the
driven system that is readily verifiable in examples. Stochastic state
contractivity can be satisfied by systems that are not state-contractive, which
is a need typically evoked to guarantee the echo state property in reservoir
computing. As a result, it may actually be satisfied even if the echo state
property is not present.

the common training paradigm of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Instead, recent research in dynamic convolution shows that learning a linear
combination of $n$ convolutional kernels weighted with their input-dependent

maintaining efficient inference. However, we observe that existing works endow
convolutional kernels with the dynamic property through one dimension
(regarding the convolutional kernel number) of the kernel space, but the other
three dimensions (regarding the spatial size, the input channel number and the
output channel number for each convolutional kernel) are overlooked. Inspired
by this, we present Omni-dimensional Dynamic Convolution (ODConv), a more
generalized yet elegant dynamic convolution design, to advance this line of
research. ODConv leverages a novel multi-dimensional attention mechanism with a
parallel strategy to learn complementary attentions for convolutional kernels
along all four dimensions of the kernel space at any convolutional layer. As a
drop-in replacement of regular convolutions, ODConv can be plugged into many
CNN architectures. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets
show that ODConv brings solid accuracy boosts for various prevailing CNN
backbones including both light-weight and large ones, e.g.,
3.77%~5.71%|1.86%~3.72% absolute top-1 improvements to MobivleNetV2|ResNet
family on the ImageNet dataset. Intriguingly, thanks to its improved feature
learning ability, ODConv with even one single kernel can compete with or
outperform existing dynamic convolution counterparts with multiple kernels,
substantially reducing extra parameters. Furthermore, ODConv is also superior
to other attention modules for modulating the output features or the
convolutional weights.

overcome these challenges, we here report the development of an incoherent

the ADF and EDX incoherence from scattering physics suggesting a linear

Taking EDX as a perfect incoherent reference mode, we quantitatively examine
the ADF longitudinal incoherence under different microscope conditions using
multislice simulations. Based on incoherent imaging, the atomic lensing model
previously developed for ADF is now expanded to EDX, which yields ADF-EDX
scattering cross-section predictions in good agreement with multislice

ancillary two-level system, interacting with the bosonic mode of interest via a
driven quantum Rabi model, and show that it is sufficient to induce the
deterministic realization of a large class of Gaussian and non-Gaussian gates,

large phase-space Wigner negativities. The universal control is further
illustrated by generating a cubic-phase gate. Finally, we address the

information into a common high-dimensional space and thereby improving
inter-subject analysis. Though successful, current hyperalignment algorithms
have a number of shortcomings, including difficulties interpreting the
transformations, a lack of uniqueness of the procedure, and difficulties
performing whole-brain analysis. To resolve these issues, we propose the
ProMises (Procrustes von Mises-Fisher) model. We reformulate functional
alignment as a statistical model and impose a prior distribution on the
orthogonal parameters (the von Mises-Fisher distribution). This allows for the
embedding of anatomical information into the estimation procedure by penalizing
the contribution of spatially distant voxels when creating the shared
functional high-dimensional space. Importantly, the transformations, aligned
images, and related results are all unique. In addition, the proposed method
allows for efficient whole-brain functional alignment. In simulations and
application to data from four fMRI studies we find that ProMises improves

diffusive crack is introduced and modelled using the phase variable. Owing to
the non-convexity of the energy functional, the derived partial differential
equations are usually solved in a staggered manner. However, this method
suffers from a low convergence rate, and a large number of staggered iterations
are needed, especially at the fracture nucleation and propagation. In this
study, we propose novel staggered schemes, which are inspired by the
fixed-stress split scheme in poromechanics. By fixing the stress when solving
the damage evolution, the displacement increment is expressed in terms of the
increment of the phase variable. The relation between these two increments
enables a prediction of the displacement and the active energy based on the
increment of the phase variable. Thus, the maximum number of staggered
iterations is reduced, and the computational efficiency is improved. We present
three staggered schemes by fixing the first invariant, second invariant, or
both invariants of the stress, denoted by S1, S2, and S3 schemes. The
performance of the schemes is then verified by comparing with the standard
staggered scheme through three benchmark examples, i.e., tensile, shear, and
L-shape panel tests. The results exhibit that the force-displacement relations
and the crack patterns computed using the fast schemes are consistent with the
ones based on the standard staggered scheme. Moreover, the proposed S1 and S2
schemes can largely reduce the maximum number of staggered iterations and total
CPU time in all benchmark tests. The S2 scheme performs comparably except in
the shear test, where the underlying assumption is violated in the region close
to the crack.

that the use of the repeated randomness assumption can be justified in the

coarse, two properties we will define rigorously. Then, our derivation will
invoke essentially only the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and typicality
arguments. While the assumption of a slow observable is subtle, as it provides
only a necessary but not sufficient condition, it also offers a unifying
perspective applicable to, e.g., open systems as well as collective observables
of many-body systems. All our ideas are numerically verified by studying
density waves in spin chains.

crucial for predicting flux tube emergence on the solar surface, an important
ingredient for space weather. The sensitivity of helioseismic mode-amplitude
cross-correlation to $p$- and $f$-mode oscillations enable formal inversion of
such sub-photospheric perturbations. It is well-known that such problems are
written in the form of an integral equation that connects the perturbations to
the observations via ``sensitivity kernels"". While the sensitivity kernels for
flow and sound-speed have been known for decades and have been used
extensively, formulating kernels for general magnetic perturbations had been
elusive. A recent study proposed sensitivity kernels for Lorentz-stresses
corresponding to global magnetic fields of general geometry. The present study
is devoted to proposing kernels for inferring Lorentz-stresses as well as the
solenoidal magnetic field in a local patch on the Sun via Cartesian
mode-coupling. Moreover, for the first time in solar physics, Slepian functions
are employed to parameterize perturbations in the horizontal dimension. This is
shown to increase the number of data constraints in the inverse problem,
implying an increase in the precision of inferred parameters. This paves the
path to reliably imaging sub-surface solar magnetic features in, e.g.,
supergranules, sunspots and (emerging) active regions.

supercooling continue to attract significant attention as there is still no
sufficient understanding of the connection between the structural changes and
the dynamic slowdown. Previously, liquids' structures were usually discussed
from the local perspective of individual particles. Here, we report on the
structural evolutions of the binary Kob-Andersen (KA) (4:1) and Wahnstr\""{o}m
(1:1) model liquids using a different approach. The approach is based on the
previously not discussed observation that in the liquid and supercooled liquid
states some particles form nearly linear chains in the temperature region where
the crystallization process has not been observed. Depending on the chain
definition, it is possible to speak about the chains containing more than 8
particles. The average number of chains monotonically increases as the
temperature of the liquid decreases. Considerations of the inherent structures
show that the number of chains remains nearly constant in the inherent
structures (IS) obtained from the parent structures (PS) above the potential
energy landscape (PEL) crossover temperature (PELCT). Below the PELCT, the
average number of chains in the IS increases, as the temperature of the PS
decreases. Counter-intuitively, for the KA system, below the PELCT the number
of chains in the PS can be larger than the number of chains in the
corresponding IS. The distributions of the potential energies (PE) of the
particles in chains show that the particles forming the chains tend to have
higher PE than the particles which are not in the chains. We also found that
the particles forming the chains diffuse at a slightly lower rate than the
global average. We also discuss the lifetimes of the chains. We compare some of

the optical activity in the chiral medium is not self-consistent, we conduct a
thorough investigation into the nature of the polarization of a plane light
wave. We demonstrate that the polarization of light is the reflection of one of
its quantum-mechanical properties, called the quasi-spin. Unexpectedly, the
quasi-spin is not an observable with respect to the laboratory coordinate
system. Instead, it is with respect to the momentum-dependent local coordinate
system. The representative operators for the quasi-spin are the Pauli matrices.
The wavefunction is the Jones vector. In order to completely determine a state
of polarization, two different kinds of degrees of freedom are needed. One is
the degrees of freedom to characterize the state of quasi-spin. They are the
Stokes parameters, the expectation values of the Pauli matrices in the state
described by the Jones vector. The other is the degrees of freedom to specify
the local coordinate system, including the propagation direction and an angle
of rotation about it. Accordingly, there are two independent mechanisms to
change the state of polarization. One is to change the state of quasi-spin in a
fixed local coordinate system. This is the traditional mechanism that can be
expressed as an SU(2) rotation of the Jones vector. The other is to change the
local coordinate system with the state of quasi-spin remaining fixed in it. At
last, we show that it is the newly-identified mechanism that accounts for the
optical activity.

problem, the Razumikhin approach is applied to the proposed method since it
includes a Lyapunov function with the original nonaugmented state space of
system models compared to Krasovskii formula. On the other hand, the Razumikhin
method act better and avoids the inherent complexity of the Krasovskii

output results, the model predictive control (MPC) is designed for the system

has better estimation of the dynamic model of the system. Here, online
optimization problems are solved by the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which

sectors is related to the kernel of the Laplacian. Based on this analysis, we
further show that the ground state degeneracy is given by $\bigl[N\times

the Laplacian that are greater than one and gcd stands for the greatest common

stopping theory with extensive applications to mechanism design and online
optimization. We study the \emph{cost minimization} counterpart of the
classical prophet inequality: a decision maker is facing a sequence of costs
$X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ drawn from known distributions in an online manner and
\emph{must} ``stop'' at some point and take the last cost seen. The goal is to
compete with a ``prophet'' who can see the realizations of all $X_i$'s upfront
and always select the minimum, obtaining a cost of $\mathbb{E}[\min_i X_i]$.
  If the $X_i$'s are not identically distributed, no strategy can achieve a
bounded approximation, even for random arrival order and $n = 2$. This leads us
to consider the case where the $X_i$'s are independent and identically
distributed (I.I.D.). For the I.I.D. case, we show that if the distribution
satisfies a mild condition, the optimal stopping strategy achieves a
(distribution-dependent) constant-factor approximation to the prophet's cost.
Moreover, for MHR distributions, this constant is at most $2$. All our results
are tight. We also demonstrate an example distribution that does not satisfy
the condition and for which the competitive ratio of any algorithm is infinite.
  Turning our attention to single-threshold strategies, we design a threshold
that achieves a $O\left(polylog{n}\right)$-factor approximation, where the
exponent in the logarithmic factor is a distribution-dependent constant, and we
show a matching lower bound. Finally, we note that our results can be used to
design approximately optimal posted price-style mechanisms for procurement
auctions which may be of independent interest.
  Our techniques utilize the \emph{hazard rate} of the distribution in a novel
way, allowing for a fine-grained analysis which could find further applications
in prophet inequalities.

CNN and Transformer-based methods usually first generate a bird's-eye-view
(BEV) feature map from the front view image, and then use a sub-network with
BEV feature map as input to predict 3D lanes. Such approaches require an
explicit view transformation between BEV and front view, which itself is still
a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose CurveFormer, a single-stage
Transformer-based method that directly calculates 3D lane parameters and can
circumvent the difficult view transformation step. Specifically, we formulate
3D lane detection as a curve propagation problem by using curve queries. A 3D
lane query is represented by a dynamic and ordered anchor point set. In this
way, queries with curve representation in Transformer decoder iteratively
refine the 3D lane detection results. Moreover, a curve cross-attention module
is introduced to compute the similarities between curve queries and image
features. Additionally, a context sampling module that can capture more
relative image features of a curve query is provided to further boost the 3D
lane detection performance. We evaluate our method for 3D lane detection on
both synthetic and real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that
our method achieves promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art
approaches. The effectiveness of each component is validated via ablation

from large amounts of data using tasks that do not require costly labeling.
Mode collapse, i.e., the model producing identical representations for all
inputs, is a central problem to many self-supervised learning approaches,
making self-supervised tasks, such as matching distorted variants of the
inputs, ineffective. In this article, we argue that a straightforward
application of information maximization among alternative latent
representations of the same input naturally solves the collapse problem and
achieves competitive empirical results. We propose a self-supervised learning
method, CorInfoMax, that uses a second-order statistics-based mutual
information measure that reflects the level of correlation among its arguments.
Maximizing this correlative information measure between alternative
representations of the same input serves two purposes: (1) it avoids the
collapse problem by generating feature vectors with non-degenerate covariances;
(2) it establishes relevance among alternative representations by increasing
the linear dependence among them. An approximation of the proposed information
maximization objective simplifies to a Euclidean distance-based objective
function regularized by the log-determinant of the feature covariance matrix.
The regularization term acts as a natural barrier against feature space
degeneracy. Consequently, beyond avoiding complete output collapse to a single
point, the proposed approach also prevents dimensional collapse by encouraging
the spread of information across the whole feature space. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that CorInfoMax achieves better or competitive performance results
relative to the state-of-the-art SSL approaches.

developing detectors that verify the authenticity of multimedia objects.
However, the vast majority of these tools only analyze one modality at a time.
This was not a problem as long as still images were considered the most widely

performing monomodal analyses could be reductive. Nonetheless, there is a lack

technical challenge is to develop a regularizer that can accurately model
realistic images and be optimized efficiently along with the loss function.
Motivated by the recent plug-and-play paradigm for image regularization, we
construct a quadratic regularizer whose reconstruction capability is
competitive with state-of-the-art regularizers. The novelty of the regularizer
is that, unlike classical regularizers, the quadratic objective function is
derived from the observed data. Since the regularizer is quadratic, we can
reduce the optimization to solving a linear system for applications such as
superresolution, deblurring, inpainting, etc. In particular, we show that using
iterative Krylov solvers, we can converge to the solution in a few iterations,
where each iteration requires an application of the forward operator and a
linear denoiser. The surprising finding is that we can get close to deep
learning methods in terms of reconstruction quality. To the best of our
knowledge, the possibility of achieving near state-of-the-art performance using
a linear solver is novel.

be corrupted by noise that prohibits traditional affinity matrices from
correctly assessing similarities, especially if the noise magnitudes vary
considerably across the data, e.g., under heteroskedasticity or outliers. An
alternative approach that provides a more stable behavior under noise is the
doubly stochastic normalization of the Gaussian kernel. In this work, we
investigate this normalization in a setting where points are sampled from an
unknown density on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in high-dimensional
space and corrupted by possibly strong, non-identically distributed,
sub-Gaussian noise. We establish the pointwise concentration of the doubly
stochastic affinity matrix and its scaling factors around certain population
forms. We then utilize these results to develop several tools for robust
inference. First, we derive a robust density estimator that can substantially
outperform the standard kernel density estimator under high-dimensional noise.
Second, we provide estimators for the pointwise noise magnitudes, the pointwise
signal magnitudes, and the pairwise Euclidean distances between clean data
points. Lastly, we derive robust graph Laplacian normalizations that
approximate popular manifold Laplacians, including the Laplace Beltrami
operator, showing that the local geometry of the manifold can be recovered

materials, most of the focus in this materials class has been on the rare earth
manganites, $R$MnO$_3$ ($R$ = rare earth); these materials display coupled
ferroelectricity and antiferromagnetic order. In this review, we focus on the
thin film manifestations of the hexagonal $AB$O$_3$ oxides. We cover the
stability of the hexagonal oxides and substrates which can be used to template
the hexagonal structure. We show how the thin film geometry not only allows for
further tuning of the bulk-stable manganites but also the realization of
metastable hexagonal oxides such as the $R$FeO$_3$ that combine
ferroelectricity with weak ferromagnetic order. The thin film geometry is a
promising platform to stabilize additional metastable hexagonal oxides to
search for predicted high-temperature superconductivity and topological phases
in this materials class.

overcoming the effects of catastrophic forgetting, which describes the sudden

  Image Denoising",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Color image denoising is frequently encountered in various image processing
and computer vision tasks. One traditional strategy is to convert the RGB image
to a less correlated color space and denoise each channel of the new space
separately. However, such a strategy can not fully exploit the correlated
information between channels and is inadequate to obtain satisfactory results.
To address this issue, this paper proposes a new multi-channel optimization
model for color image denoising under the nuclear norm minus Frobenius norm
minimization framework. Specifically, based on the block-matching, the color
image is decomposed into overlapping RGB patches. For each patch, we stack its
similar neighbors to form the corresponding patch matrix. The proposed model is
performed on the patch matrix to recover its noise-free version. During the
recovery process, a) a weight matrix is introduced to fully utilize the noise
difference between channels; b) the singular values are shrunk adaptively
without additionally assigning weights. With them, the proposed model can
achieve promising results while keeping simplicity. To solve the proposed
model, an accurate and effective algorithm is built based on the alternating
direction method of multipliers framework. The solution of each updating step
can be analytically expressed in closed-from. Rigorous theoretical analysis
proves the solution sequences generated by the proposed algorithm converge to
their respective stationary points. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real noise datasets demonstrate the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art
models.

approaches were designed to be independent of the patient-specific geometries
and directly applicable to surface ECG signals, while also delivering a binary
transmural position. One method outputs ranked alternative solutions. Results
can be visualized either on a generic or patient geometry. The CNNs were
trained on a data set containing only simulated data and evaluated both on
simulated and clinical test data. On simulated data, the median test error was
below 3mm. The median localization error on the clinical data was as low as
32mm. The transmural position was correctly detected in up to 82% of all
clinical cases. Using the ranked alternative solutions, the top-3 median error
dropped to 20mm on clinical data. These results demonstrate a proof of
principle to utilize CNNs to localize the activation source without the
intrinsic need of patient-specific geometrical information. Furthermore,
delivering multiple solutions can help the physician to find the real
activation source amongst more than one possible locations. With further
optimization, these methods have a high potential to speed up clinical
interventions. Consequently they could decrease procedural risk and improve VT

particularly vulnerable to model stealing attacks due to the high
dimensionality of vector representations they output. Yet, encoders remain
undefended: existing mitigation strategies for stealing attacks focus on
supervised learning. We introduce a new dataset inference defense, which uses
the private training set of the victim encoder model to attribute its ownership

on test data if it is stolen from the victim, but not if it is independently

attributes, and relationships between objects in a scene. Scene graphs play an
important role in many cross modality tasks, as they are able to capture the
interactions between images and texts. In this paper, we focus on scene graph
modification (SGM), where the system is required to learn how to update an
existing scene graph based on a natural language query. Unlike previous
approaches that rebuilt the entire scene graph, we frame SGM as a graph
expansion task by introducing the incremental structure expanding (ISE). ISE
constructs the target graph by incrementally expanding the source graph without
changing the unmodified structure. Based on ISE, we further propose a model
that iterates between nodes prediction and edges prediction, inferring more
accurate and harmonious expansion decisions progressively. In addition, we
construct a challenging dataset that contains more complicated queries and
larger scene graphs than existing datasets. Experiments on four benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by large margins.

investigated the efficiency of 3d transitional metal (from Sc to Zn) SACs in
adsorption for the Cr(VI) removal via a theoretical approach. DFT calculations
were used to measure the structural and energetic of Cr(VI) (H2CrO4 and
Cr2O72-) adsorption behavior on the SACs systems. The Ti-N-C has a good
performance for the H2CrO4 and Cr2O72- removal and has important environmental
protection significance for water purification. In addition, our results show
that the binding energy of the SACs systems for H2CrO4 adsorption is found to
be much less than that for Cr2O72- adsorption, indicating that reduction of
Cr(VI) in Cr2O72- is energetically favorable than that of Cr(VI) in H2CrO4.

  Models",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Active inference is a first principles approach for understanding the brain
in particular, and sentient agents in general, with the single imperative of
minimizing free energy. As such, it provides a computational account for
modelling artificial intelligent agents, by defining the agent's generative
model and inferring the model parameters, actions and hidden state beliefs.
However, the exact specification of the generative model and the hidden state
space structure is left to the experimenter, whose design choices influence the
resulting behaviour of the agent. Recently, deep learning methods have been
proposed to learn a hidden state space structure purely from data, alleviating
the experimenter from this tedious design task, but resulting in an entangled,
non-interpreteable state space. In this paper, we hypothesize that such a
learnt, entangled state space does not necessarily yield the best model in
terms of free energy, and that enforcing different factors in the state space
can yield a lower model complexity. In particular, we consider the problem of
3D object representation, and focus on different instances of the ShapeNet
dataset. We propose a model that factorizes object shape, pose and category,
while still learning a representation for each factor using a deep neural
network. We show that models, with best disentanglement properties, perform
best when adopted by an active agent in reaching preferred observations.

to natural language, describing temporal and logical relations hidden in the

to learn formula structures and accomplish a multiclass TSC task. The proposed
smooth activation functions for wSTL allow the model to be learned in an
end-to-end fashion. We test NSTSC on a real-world wound healing dataset from

that NSTSC achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art models.

consider the deployment population. When the population of patients with
observed labels is only a subset of the deployment population (label
selection), standard model performance estimates on the observed population may
be misleading. In this study we describe three classes of label selection and
simulate five causally distinct scenarios to assess how particular selection
mechanisms bias a suite of commonly reported binary machine learning model
performance metrics. Simulations reveal that when selection is affected by
observed features, naive estimates of model discrimination may be misleading.
When selection is affected by labels, naive estimates of calibration fail to
reflect reality. We borrow traditional weighting estimators from causal
inference literature and find that when selection probabilities are properly
specified, they recover full population estimates. We then tackle the
real-world task of monitoring the performance of deployed machine learning
models whose interactions with clinicians feed-back and affect the selection
mechanism of the labels. We train three machine learning models to flag
low-yield laboratory diagnostics, and simulate their intended consequence of
reducing wasteful laboratory utilization. We find that naive estimates of AUROC
on the observed population undershoot actual performance by up to 20%. Such a
disparity could be large enough to lead to the wrongful termination of a
successful clinical decision support tool. We propose an altered deployment
procedure, one that combines injected randomization with traditional weighted

itself may not be adequate for such tasks; therefore, recent methods attempted
to incorporate other intrinsic signals such as user behavior and the underlying
graph structure. Oftentimes, the `public wisdom' expressed through the
comments/replies to a social-text acts as a surrogate of crowd-sourced view and
may provide us with complementary signals. State-of-the-art methods on
social-text classification tend to ignore such a rich hierarchical signal.
Here, we propose Hyphen, a discourse-aware hyperbolic spectral co-attention
network. Hyphen is a fusion of hyperbolic graph representation learning with a
novel Fourier co-attention mechanism in an attempt to generalise the
social-text classification tasks by incorporating public discourse. We parse
public discourse as an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph and use the
powerful hyperbolic geometric representation to model graphs with hierarchical
structure. Finally, we equip it with a novel Fourier co-attention mechanism to
capture the correlation between the source post and public discourse. Extensive
experiments on four different social-text classification tasks, namely
detecting fake news, hate speech, rumour, and sarcasm, show that Hyphen
generalises well, and achieves state-of-the-art results on ten benchmark
datasets. We also employ a sentence-level fact-checked and annotated dataset to
evaluate how Hyphen is capable of producing explanations as analogous evidence
to the final prediction.

attention in the wireless networks domain. They are considered promising
approaches for solving dynamic radio resource management (RRM) problems in
next-generation networks. Given their capabilities to build an approximate and
continuously updated model of the wireless network environments, DRL algorithms
can deal with the multifaceted complexity of such environments. Nevertheless,
several challenges hinder the practical adoption of DRL in commercial networks.
In this article, we first discuss two key practical challenges that are faced
but rarely tackled when developing DRL-based RRM solutions. We argue that it is
inevitable to address these DRL-related challenges for DRL to find its way to
RRM commercial solutions. In particular, we discuss the need to have safe and
accelerated DRL-based RRM solutions that mitigate the slow convergence and
performance instability exhibited by DRL algorithms. We then review and
categorize the main approaches used in the RRM domain to develop safe and
accelerated DRL-based solutions. Finally, a case study is conducted to
demonstrate the importance of having safe and accelerated DRL-based RRM
solutions. We employ multiple variants of transfer learning (TL) techniques to
accelerate the convergence of intelligent radio access network (RAN) slicing
DRL-based controllers. We also propose a hybrid TL-based approach and sigmoid
function-based rewards as examples of safe exploration in DRL-based RAN
slicing.

layer, ensuring reliable data transfer over noisy channels. Recently, neural
decoders have demonstrated their advantage over classical decoding techniques.
However, recent state-of-the-art neural decoders suffer from high complexity
and lack the important iterative scheme characteristic of many legacy decoders.
In this work, we propose to employ denoising diffusion models for the soft
decoding of linear codes at arbitrary block lengths. Our framework models the
forward channel corruption as a series of diffusion steps that can be reversed
iteratively. Three contributions are made: (i) a diffusion process suitable for
the decoding setting is introduced, (ii) the neural diffusion decoder is
conditioned on the number of parity errors, which indicates the level of
corruption at a given step, (iii) a line search procedure based on the code's
syndrome obtains the optimal reverse diffusion step size. The proposed approach
demonstrates the power of diffusion models for ECC and is able to achieve state
of the art accuracy, outperforming the other neural decoders by sizable
margins, even for a single reverse diffusion step.

connectivity acceptance using the false discovery rate method for multiple

Information Rate, discuss the statistical significance tests and the false
discovery rate. Further on, we present results for correlated normal-variates

coupled stochastic Kuramoto phase oscillators. Following up, we study the
effect of noise on the presented methodology in networks of coupled stochastic
Kuramoto phase oscillators and of coupling heterogeneity degree on networks of
coupled circle maps. We show that the method can infer the correct number and
pairs of connected nodes, by means of receiver operating characteristic curves.
In the more realistic case of stochastic data, we demonstrate its ability to
infer the structure of the initial connectivity matrices. The method is also
shown to recover the initial connectivity matrices for dynamics on the nodes of
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and small-world networks with varying coupling heterogeneity

proposed competing constitutive models to best characterize the behavior of
natural and man-made materials in response to mechanical loading. Now, computer
science offers a universal solution: Neural Networks. Neural Networks are
powerful function approximators that can learn constitutive relations from
large data without any knowledge of the underlying physics. However, classical
Neural Networks ignore a century of research in constitutive modeling, violate
thermodynamic considerations, and fail to predict the behavior outside the
training regime. Here we design a new family of Constitutive Artificial Neural
Networks that inherently satisfy common kinematic, thermodynamic, and physic
constraints and, at the same time, constrain the design space of admissible
functions to create robust approximators, even in the presence of sparse data.
We revisit the non-linear field theories of mechanics and reverse-engineer the
network input to account for material objectivity, symmetry, and
incompressibility; the network output to enforce thermodynamic consistency; the
activation functions to implement physically reasonable restrictions; and the
network architecture to ensure polyconvexity. We demonstrate that this new
class of models is a generalization of the classical neo Hooke, Blatz Ko,
Mooney Rivlin, Yeoh, and Demiray models and that the network weights have a
clear physical interpretation. When trained with classical benchmark data for
rubber, our network autonomously selects the best constitutive model and learns
its parameters. Our findings suggests that Constitutive Artificial Neural
Networks have the potential to induce a paradigm shift in constitutive
modeling, from user-defined model selection to automated model discovery. Our

quantum networks to perform massively complex computational tasks. However, DQC
faces problems sharing quantum information because it cannot be cloned or
duplicated between quantum computers. Thanks to advanced quantum mechanics,
quantum computers can teleport quantum information across quantum networks.
However, challenges to utilizing efficiently quantum resources, e.g., quantum
computers and quantum channels, arise in DQC due to their capabilities and
properties, such as uncertain qubit fidelity and quantum channel noise. In this
paper, we propose a resource allocation scheme for DQC based on stochastic
programming to minimize the total deployment cost for quantum resources.
Essentially, the two-stage stochastic programming model is formulated to handle
the uncertainty of quantum computing demands, computing power, and fidelity in
quantum networks. The performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and
ability of the proposed scheme to balance the utilization of quantum computers
and on-demand quantum computers while minimizing the overall cost of
provisioning under uncertainty.

between healthy children and those who are diagnosed with ADHD. Specifically,
ME-SpecVar model will be used to formally test for significant connectivity
structure obtained using filtered EEG signals in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and
gamma frequency bands. The suggested model allows one-stage procedure for
deriving Granger causality in common group structure and variation of subject
specific random effects in different frequency oscillations. The model revealed
novel results and showed more significant connections in all frequency bands
and especially in slow waves in control group. In contrast, children with ADHD
shared a pattern of diminished connectivity and variability of random effects.
The results are consistent with previous findings about decreased
anterior-posterior connectivity in children with ADHD. Moreover, the novel
finding is that the most diverse subject specific effective connectivity
parameters in healthy children belong to parietal-occipital region that is
associated with conscious visual attention.

several tokenization techniques, demonstrating how these improve performance on
the low resource translation task of Text to Gloss. We introduce Text to

sign and use this as additional supervision during training, further increasing
the performance on T2H. Assembling best practise, we achieve a BLEU-4 score of
