  Classification","COLING 2022",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Few-shot text classification aims to classify the text under the few-shot
scenario. Most of the previous methods adopt optimization-based meta learning
to obtain task distribution. However, due to the neglect of matching between
the few amount of samples and complicated models, as well as the distinction
between useful and useless task features, these methods suffer from the
overfitting issue. To address this issue, we propose a novel Adaptive
Meta-learner via Gradient Similarity (AMGS) method to improve the model
generalization ability to a new task. Specifically, the proposed AMGS
alleviates the overfitting based on two aspects: (i) acquiring the potential
semantic representation of samples and improving model generalization through
the self-supervised auxiliary task in the inner loop, (ii) leveraging the
adaptive meta-learner via gradient similarity to add constraints on the
gradient obtained by base-learner in the outer loop. Moreover, we make a
systematic analysis of the influence of regularization on the entire framework.
Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed AMGS
consistently improves few-shot text classification performance compared with
the state-of-the-art optimization-based meta-learning approaches.

was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It has resulted in an ongoing
pandemic that caused infected cases including some deaths. Coronavirus is
primarily spread between people during close contact. Motivating to this
notion, this research proposes an artificial intelligence system for social
distancing classification of persons by using thermal images. By exploiting
YOLOv2 (you look at once), a deep learning detection technique is developed for
detecting and tracking people in indoor and outdoor scenarios. An algorithm is
also implemented for measuring and classifying the distance between persons and
automatically check if social distancing rules are respected or not. Hence,
this work aims at minimizing the spread of the COVID-19 virus by evaluating if
and how persons comply with social distancing rules. The proposed approach is
applied to images acquired through thermal cameras, to establish a complete AI
system for people tracking, social distancing classification, and body
temperature monitoring. The training phase is done with two datasets captured
from different thermal cameras. Ground Truth Labeler app is used for labeling
the persons in the images. The achieved results show that the proposed method
is suitable for the creation of a smart surveillance system in smart cities for
people detection, social distancing classification, and body temperature
analysis.

assessments do not quantitatively measure patient-performed motions, which
makes it difficult to track progress for incremental changes. Assessing motor

because they can be nervous or excited during experiments, or simply be too
young to follow precise instructions. These challenges translate to confounding
factors such as performing different parts of the arm curl slower or faster

curve registration and shape analysis to temporally align trajectories while
simultaneously extracting a mean reference shape. Distances from this mean
shape are used to assess the quality of motion. The proposed metric is
invariant to confounding factors, such as phase variability, while suggesting
several clinically relevant insights. First, there are statistically
significant differences between functional scores for the control and patient

chromium (Cr) intercalated chiral disulfide Cr$_x$Nb$_3$S$_6$ in order to
optimize the synthesis condition for the intercalation-controlled single

$T_{c}$ take different values depending on the samples. We systematically grew
single crystals of Cr$_{x}$Nb$_{3}$S$_{6}$ with $x$ ranged from 0.89 to 1.03

controlling the magnetic properties of the grown crystals. The magnetization
anomaly, which appears in the temperature dependence as evidence of the
formation of chiral magnetic soliton lattice (CSL), was observed only in a
narrow region of $x$ from 0.98 to 1.03. The single crystals with $x$ being 0.98

each latent variable was sampled from the distribution associated with a single
kernel of the last encoder's convolution layer, as an individual distribution
was created for each kernel. Therefore, choosing relevant features on the
sampled latent variables makes it possible to perform kernel selection,
filtering the uninformative features and kernels. Such leads to a reduction in
the number of the model's parameters. Both wrapper and filter methods were
evaluated for feature selection. The second was of particular relevance as it
is based only on the distributions of the kernels. It was assessed by measuring
the Kullback-Leibler divergence between all distributions, hypothesizing that
the kernels whose distributions are more similar can be discarded. This

Huntington's disease clinical trial is problematic since time to diagnosis, a
key covariate, can be heavily censored. Imputation is an appealing strategy
where censored covariates are replaced with their conditional means, but
existing methods saw over 200% bias under heavy censoring. Calculating these
conditional means well requires estimating and then integrating over the
survival function of the censored covariate from the censored value to
infinity. To flexibly estimate the survival function, existing methods use the
semiparametric Cox model with Breslow's estimator. Then, for integration, the
trapezoidal rule is used, but the trapezoidal rule is not designed for improper
integrals and leads to bias. We propose calculating the conditional mean with
adaptive quadrature instead, which can handle the improper integral. Yet, even
with adaptive quadrature, the integrand (the survival function) is undefined
beyond the observed data, so we identify the ""Weibull extension"" as the best
method to extrapolate and then integrate. In simulation studies, we show that
replacing the trapezoidal rule with adaptive quadrature and adopting the
Weibull extension corrects the bias seen with existing methods. We further show
how imputing with corrected conditional means helps to prioritize patients for
future clinical trials.

instructions to reach a specific target. The large discrepancy between seen and
unseen environments makes it challenging for the agent to generalize well.
Previous studies propose data augmentation methods to mitigate the data bias
explicitly or implicitly and provide improvements in generalization. However,
they try to memorize augmented trajectories and ignore the distribution shifts
under unseen environments at test time. In this paper, we propose an Unseen
Discrepancy Anticipating Vision and Language Navigation (DAVIS) that learns to
generalize to unseen environments via encouraging test-time visual consistency.
Specifically, we devise: 1) a semi-supervised framework DAVIS that leverages
visual consistency signals across similar semantic observations. 2) a two-stage
learning procedure that encourages adaptation to test-time distribution. The
framework enhances the basic mixture of imitation and reinforcement learning
with Momentum Contrast to encourage stable decision-making on similar
observations under a joint training stage and a test-time adaptation stage.
Extensive experiments show that DAVIS achieves model-agnostic improvement over
previous state-of-the-art VLN baselines on R2R and RxR benchmarks. Our source

into frequent outages (for some applications) when such diverse traffics

In this paper, we explore the design space of a simple, practical and

different agents' choices that violate the assumptions of independence on which

emerge when agents are rewarded solely based on their individual accuracy, and
the impact of this on collective accuracy. I then demonstrate how a simple
competitive reward scheme, where agents' rewards are greater if they correctly
choose options that few have already chosen, can induce rational agents to make
independent choices, returning the group to optimal levels of collective
accuracy. I further show that this reward scheme is robust, offering
improvements to collective accuracy across of wide range of competition
strengths, suggesting that such schemes could be effectively implemented in

allows superluminal propagations, dramatically alters the causal structure of
the spacetime and modifies the notion of black holes. In particular, instead of
metric horizons, now {\it universal horizons} define the boundaries of black
holes, within which a particle cannot escape to spatial infinities even with an
infinitely large speed. Then, a natural question is how the quasi-normal modes
(QNMs) of a black hole are modified, if one considers the universal horizon as
its causal boundary. In this paper, we study in detail this problem in
Einstein-aether theory, a vector-tensor theory that violates LI but yet is
self-consistent and satisfies all observations carried out so far. Technically,
this poses several challenges, including singularities of the perturbation
equations across metric horizons and proper identifications of ingoing modes at
universal horizons. After overcoming these difficulties, we show that the QNMs
of the Schwarzschild black hole, also a solution of Einstein-aether theory,
consist of two parts, the metric and aether parts. The QNMs of the metric
perturbations are quite similar to those obtained in general relativity and are
consistent with current observations of gravitational waves. But the ones from
aether perturbations are different, and our numerical studies indicate that
they are even not stable. The latter is consistent with our previous studies,
which showed that the stealth Schwarzschild black hole suffers a Laplacian
instability along the angular direction. The method and techniques developed in
this paper can be applied to the studies of QNMs in other theories of gravity
with broken LI.

stochasticity due to the finite number of sensing proteins limits the accuracy
of galvanotaxis via electrophoresis. Using maximum likelihood estimation, we
show how cells can best interpret this noisy signal, and how their accuracy
should depend on the cell size and electric field strength. Our model can be
fit well to data measuring galvanotaxis of keratocytes, neural crest cells, and
granulocytes. Our results show that eukaryotic cells can likely achieve
experimentally observed directionalities with either a relatively small number
(around 100) of highly-polarized proteins, or a large number (~10,000) of
proteins with a relatively small change in concentration across the cell (~7%
change from cathode to anode). This may explain why identifying the sensor
species has been difficult, as candidates need not be strongly polarized even

large, making an exhaustive search infeasible, experimental design strategies
are needed. In this context, encoding the causal relationships between the
variables, and thus the effect of interventions on the system, is critical in
order to identify desirable interventions efficiently. We develop an iterative
causal method to identify optimal interventions, as measured by the discrepancy
between the post-interventional mean of the distribution and a desired target
mean. We formulate an active learning strategy that uses the samples obtained
so far from different interventions to update the belief about the underlying
causal model, as well as to identify samples that are most informative about
optimal interventions and thus should be acquired in the next batch. The
approach employs a Bayesian update for the causal model and prioritizes
interventions using a carefully designed, causally informed acquisition
function. This acquisition function is evaluated in closed form, allowing for
efficient optimization. The resulting algorithms are theoretically grounded
with information-theoretic bounds and provable consistency results. We
illustrate the method on both synthetic data and real-world biological data,
namely gene expression data from Perturb-CITE-seq experiments, to identify
optimal perturbations that induce a specific cell state transition; the
proposed causal approach is observed to achieve better sample efficiency
compared to several baselines. In both cases we observe that the causally
informed acquisition function notably outperforms existing criteria allowing
for optimal intervention design with significantly less experiments.

vision, demonstrating remarkable results in the area of generative modeling. A
diffusion model is a deep generative model that is based on two stages, a
forward diffusion stage and a reverse diffusion stage. In the forward diffusion
stage, the input data is gradually perturbed over several steps by adding
Gaussian noise. In the reverse stage, a model is tasked at recovering the
original input data by learning to gradually reverse the diffusion process,
step by step. Diffusion models are widely appreciated for the quality and
diversity of the generated samples, despite their known computational burdens,
i.e. low speeds due to the high number of steps involved during sampling. In
this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of articles on denoising
diffusion models applied in vision, comprising both theoretical and practical
contributions in the field. First, we identify and present three generic
diffusion modeling frameworks, which are based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models, noise conditioned score networks, and stochastic
differential equations. We further discuss the relations between diffusion
models and other deep generative models, including variational auto-encoders,
generative adversarial networks, energy-based models, autoregressive models and
normalizing flows. Then, we introduce a multi-perspective categorization of
diffusion models applied in computer vision. Finally, we illustrate the current
limitations of diffusion models and envision some interesting directions for
future research.

algorithmic bidding (or autobidding) in online advertising markets, and has
enabled online ad platforms to produce signals through machine learning
techniques (i.e., ML advice) on advertisers' true perceived values for ad
conversions. Previous works have studied the auction design problem while
incorporating ML advice through various forms to improve total welfare of
advertisers. Yet, such improvements could come at the cost of individual
bidders' welfare, consequently eroding fairness of the ad platform. Motivated
by this, we study how ad platforms can utilize ML advice to improve welfare
guarantees and fairness on the individual bidder level in the autobidding
world. We focus on a practical setting where ML advice takes the form of lower
confidence bounds (or confidence intervals). We motivate a simple approach that
directly sets such advice as personalized reserve prices when the platform
consists of value-maximizing autobidders who are subject to return-on-ad spent
(ROAS) constraints competing in multiple parallel auctions. Under parallel VCG
auctions with ML advice-based reserves, we present a worst-case welfare
lower-bound guarantee for individual agents, and show that platform fairness is
positively correlated with ML advice quality. We also present an instance that
demonstrates our welfare guarantee is tight. Further, we prove an impossibility
result showing that no truthful, and possibly randomized mechanism with
anonymous allocations and ML advice as personalized reserves can achieve
universally better fairness guarantees than VCG when coupled with ML advice of
the same quality. Finally, we extend our fairness guarantees with ML advice to
generalized first price (GFP) and generalized second price (GSP) auctions.

study their impact on the phenomenology of the singlet vector leptoquark
($U_1$) model addressing the hints of lepton flavor universality violation in
the semileptonic decays of $B$ mesons ($B$ meson anomalies), by carrying out a
global fit analysis. In general, we found that a minimal version of the $U_1$
model with a mass of 1.8 TeV can successfully explain the $B$ meson anomalies,
while being compatible with all other flavor observables and LHC bounds.
Interestingly, our study shows that the new observables $R(\Lambda_c)$ and
$R_{\Upsilon(3S)}$ generate strong tension, leading to non-trivial effects on
the global fit. Future improvements at the LHCb and Belle II experiments would
help to understand their complementarity. Moreover, we also analyze the impact
of the expected sensitivity on flavor observables at Belle II to provide a
further test of the $U_1$ model. Finally, we study the minimal assumptions
under which the $U_1$ model could, in addition, provide a combined explanation
of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.

room temperature, the supercooled state is extremely sensitive to pressure such

significant reduction of visible light transmittance from about 95% to a few

parameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and
inference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and
memory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes
and edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model
compression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has
been mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks
such as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize
two state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2)
sparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs. We evaluate
and compare the efficiency of both methods in terms of accuracy, training
sparsity, and training FLOPs on real-world graphs. Our experimental results
show that on the ia-email, wiki-talk, and stackoverflow datasets for link
prediction, sparse training with much lower training FLOPs achieves a
comparable accuracy with the train and prune method. On the brain dataset for
node classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7
FLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy
performance under extreme model sparsity.

nonparametric as the null hypothesis only assumes the time series concerned is
martingale difference without specifying any parametric forms of its

robust to the cross-series dependence of unknown magnitude. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first valid test for the martingale difference

physical origin is still unknown. Outstandingly, the first repeater FRB 121102
appears extremely high burst rate with the maximum value reaching
$122\,\mathrm{h^{-1}}$ or even higher. In this work, we propose that the high
burst rate of an FRB repeater may be due to plate collisions in the crust of
young neutron stars (NSs). In the crust of an NS, vortex lines are pinned to
the lattice nuclei. When the relative angular velocity between the superfluid
neutrons and the NS lattices is nonzero, a pinned force will act on the vortex
lines, which will cause the lattice displacement and the strain on the NS crust
growing. With the spin evolution, the crustal strain reaches a critical value,
then the crust may crack into plates, and each of plates will collide with its
adjacent ones. The Aflv\'en wave could be launched by the plate collisions and
further produce FRBs. In this scenario, the predicted burst rate can reach
$\sim 770\,\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ for an NS with the magnetic field of
$10^{13}\,\rm{G}$ and the spin period of $0.01\,\rm{s}$. We further apply this
model to FRB 121102, and predict the waiting time and energy distribution to be
$P(t_{\mathrm{w}}) \propto t_{\text{w}}^{\alpha_{t_{\text{w}}}}$ with
$\alpha_{t_{\text{w}}} \simeq -1.75$ and $N(E)\text{d}E \propto
E^{\alpha_{E}}\text{d}E$ with $\alpha_{E} \simeq -1.67$, respectively. These
properties are consistent with the observations of FRB 121102.

superconductivity and Majorana fermions. In this paper, we carry out a
comprehensive study of the band topology and topological surface states of a
number of iron-based superconductors using a combination of density functional
theory (DFT) and dynamical mean field theory. We find that the strong
electronic correlation of Fe 3d electrons plays a crucial role in determining
the band topology and topological surface states of iron-based superconductors.
Electronic correlation not only strongly renormalizes the bandwidth of Fe 3d
electrons, but also shifts the band positions of both Fe 3d and As/Se p
electrons. As a result, electronic correlation moves the DFT-calculated
topological surface states of many iron-based superconductors much closer to
the Fermi level, which is crucial for realizing topological superconducting
surface states and observing Majorana zero modes as well as achieving practical
applications, such as quantum computation. More importantly, electronic
correlation can change the band topology and make some iron-based
superconductors topologically nontrivial with topological surface states
whereas they have trivial band topology and no topological surface states in
DFT calculations. Our paper demonstrates that it is important to take into
account electronic correlation effects in order to accurately determine the
band topology and topological surface states of iron-based superconductors and
other strongly correlated materials.

Target Recognition (ATR) systems have shown to be highly vulnerable to
adversarial perturbations that are deliberately designed yet almost
imperceptible but can bias DNN inference when added to targeted objects. This
leads to serious safety concerns when applying DNNs to high-stake SAR ATR
applications. Therefore, enhancing the adversarial robustness of DNNs is
essential for implementing DNNs to modern real-world SAR ATR systems. Toward
building more robust DNN-based SAR ATR models, this article explores the domain
knowledge of SAR imaging process and proposes a novel Scattering Model Guided
Adversarial Attack (SMGAA) algorithm which can generate adversarial
perturbations in the form of electromagnetic scattering response (called
adversarial scatterers). The proposed SMGAA consists of two parts: 1) a
parametric scattering model and corresponding imaging method and 2) a
customized gradient-based optimization algorithm. First, we introduce the
effective Attributed Scattering Center Model (ASCM) and a general imaging
method to describe the scattering behavior of typical geometric structures in
the SAR imaging process. By further devising several strategies to take the
domain knowledge of SAR target images into account and relax the greedy search
procedure, the proposed method does not need to be prudentially finetuned, but
can efficiently to find the effective ASCM parameters to fool the SAR
classifiers and facilitate the robust model training. Comprehensive evaluations
on the MSTAR dataset show that the adversarial scatterers generated by SMGAA
are more robust to perturbations and transformations in the SAR processing
chain than the currently studied attacks, and are effective to construct a
defensive model against the malicious scatterers.

and time-to-event processes and they are assumed to be conditionally
independent given these latent random variables. Under this assumption, the
joint likelihood of the two processes can be easily derived and the association
between them, as well as heterogeneity among population are naturally
introduced by the unobservable latent random variables. However, because of the
unobservable nature of these latent variables, the conditional independence
assumption is difficult to verify. Therefore, a bivariate functional copula is
introduced into a regular joint model to account for the cases where there
could be extra association between the two processes which cannot be captured
by the latent random variables. Our proposed model includes a regular joint
model as a special case when the correlation function, which is modelled
continuously by B-spline basis functions as a function of time $t,$ is constant
at 0 under the bivariate Gaussian copula. Simulation studies and dynamic
prediction of survival probabilities are conducted to compare the performance
of the proposed model with the regular joint model and a real data application
on the Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) data is performed.

efficiently reduces to computing the rank of a matrix whose entries are linear
polynomials in noncommuting variables\cite{HW15}. This rank computation problem
has deterministic polynomial-time white-box algorithms \cite{GGOW16, IQS18} and
a randomized polynomial-time algorithm in the black-box setting \cite{DM17}. In
this paper, we propose a new approach for efficient derandomization of
\emph{black-box} RIT. Additionally, we obtain results for matrix rank
computation over the free skew field, and construct efficient linear pencil
representations for a new class of rational expressions. More precisely, we
show the following results:
  1. Under the hardness assumption that the ABP (algebraic branching program)
complexity of every polynomial identity for the $k\times k$ matrix algebra is
$2^{\Omega(k)}$ \cite{BW05}, we obtain a subexponential-time black-box
algorithm for RIT in almost general setting. This can be seen as the first
""hardness implies derandomization"" type theorem for rational formulas.
  2. We show that the noncommutative rank of any matrix over the free skew
field whose entries have small linear pencil representations can be computed in
deterministic polynomial time. Prior to this, an efficient rank computation was
only known for matrices with noncommutative formulas as entries\cite{GGOW20}.
As special cases of our algorithm, we obtain the first deterministic
polynomial-time algorithms for rank computation of matrices whose entries are
noncommutative ABPs or rational formulas.
  3. Motivated by the definition given by Bergman\cite{Ber76}, we define a new
class that contains noncommutative ABPs and rational formulas. We obtain a
polynomial-size linear pencil representation for this class. As a by-product,
we obtain a white-box deterministic polynomial-time identity testing algorithm
for the class.

planning framework designed to operate in a user-defined task space, as opposed
to the robot's workspace, that intentionally trades off workspace generality
for planning and execution time efficiency. Our framework automatically
constructs trajectory libraries that are queried online, similar to previous
methods that exploit offline computation. Importantly, our method also offers
bounded suboptimality guarantees on trajectory length. The key idea is to
establish approximate isometries known as $\epsilon$-Gromov-Hausdorff
approximations such that points that are close by in task space are also close
in configuration space. These bounding relations further imply that
trajectories can be smoothly concatenated, which enables our framework to
address batch-query scenarios where the objective is to find a minimum length
sequence of trajectories that visit an unordered set of goals. We evaluate our

retargeting methods create outputs that suffer from artifacts and distortions.
Besides, most previous works attempt to retarget the background and foreground
of the input image simultaneously. Simultaneous resizing of the foreground and
background causes changes in the aspect ratios of the objects. The change in
the aspect ratio is specifically not desirable for human objects. We propose a
retargeting method that overcomes these problems. The proposed approach
consists of the following steps. Firstly, an inpainting method uses the input
image and the binary mask of foreground objects to produce a background image
without any foreground objects. Secondly, the seam carving method resizes the
background image to the target size. Then, a super-resolution method increases
the input image quality, and we then extract the foreground objects. Finally,
the retargeted background and the extracted super-resolued objects are fed into
a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). The PSO algorithm uses aesthetic
quality assessment as its objective function to identify the best location and
size for the objects to be placed in the background. We used image quality
assessment and aesthetic quality assessment measures to show our superior
results compared to popular image retargeting techniques.

learning (DL)-based method called CDAE-DNN is proposed for hybrid analog and
digital (HAD) massive MIMO receive array with overlapped subarray (OSA)
architecture in this paper. In the proposed method, the sample covariance
matrix (SCM) is first input to a convolution denoise autoencoder (CDAE) to
remove the approximation error, then the output of CDAE is imported to a
fully-connected (FC) network to get the estimation result. Based on the
simulation results, the proposed CDAE-DNN has great performance advantages over
traditional MUSIC algorithm and CNN-based method, especially in the situations
with low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and low snapshot numbers. And the OSA
architecture has also been shown to significantly improve the estimation
accuracy compared to non-overlapped subarray (NOSA) architecture. In addition,
the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the HAD-OSA architecture is presented.

great capacity to solve large-scale control problems with homogeneous agents.
To break the homogeneity restriction of mean-field theory, a recent interest is
to introduce graphon theory to the mean-field paradigm. In this paper, we
propose a graphon mean-field control (GMFC) framework to approximate
cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with nonuniform
interactions and show that the approximate order is of
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$, with $N$ the number of agents. By
discretizing the graphon index of GMFC, we further introduce a smaller class of
GMFC called block GMFC, which is shown to well approximate cooperative MARL.
Our empirical studies on several examples demonstrate that our GMFC approach is
comparable with the state-of-art MARL algorithms while enjoying better
scalability.

  and non-inertial quantum systems","PhD Thesis, 222 pages",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Geometric phase plays a fundamental role in quantum theory and accounts for
wide phenomena ranging from the Aharanov-Bohm effect, the integer and
fractional quantum hall effects, and topological phases of matter, including
topological insulators, to name a few. In this thesis, we have proposed a fresh
perspective of geodesics and null phase curves, which are key ingredients in
understanding the geometric phase. We have also looked at a number of
applications of geometric phases in topological phases, quantum walks, and
non-inertial quantum systems.
  The shortest curve between any two points on a given surface is a (minimal)
geodesic. They are also the curves along which a system does not acquire any
geometric phase. In the same context, we can generalize geodesics to define a
larger class of curves, known as null phase curves (NPCs), along which also the
acquired geometric phase is zero; however, they need not be the shortest curves
between the two points. We have proposed a geometrical decomposition of
geodesics and null phase curves on the Bloch sphere, which is crucial in
improving our understanding of the geometry of the state space and the
intrinsic symmetries of geodesics and NPCs.
  We have also investigated the persistence of topological phases in quantum
walks in the presence of an external (lossy) environment. We show that the
topological order in one and two-dimensional quantum walks persist against
moderate losses. Further, we use the geometric phase to detect the non-inertial
modifications to the field correlators perceived by a circularly rotating
two-level atom placed inside a cavity.

enhancements of the cavities. Here, we show that whispering gallery modes
(WGMs) of a subwavelength dielectric cavity can not only greatly boost the
emission rate of a MD emitter but also bring efficient couplings between
coherent MD emitters. In a WGM cavity, the maximal emission rate ({\gamma}max)
of a single emitter occurs at an antinode of the field pattern. The emission of
the MD emitter can also be greatly affected by another coherent one depending
on the magnetic field response of the WGM. The maximal contribution can also
reach {\gamma}max. Notably, the cooperative emission rate of the coherent MD
emitters does not decay with distance in the considered range due to the
high-quality feature of a WGM. In contrast to the emission, the absorption of
an emitter is hardly affected by the coherent couplings between emitters
mediated by a WGM. The difference between the performances of emission and
absorption is highly related to the excitation behaviors of WGMs. Our results
are important for enhanced magnetic light-matter interactions.

branch for local feature representations. The attention branches focus on the
relevant features of the image while suppressing the irrelevant backgrounds. In
order to overcome the weakness of the attention mechanisms, equivariant to
pixel shuffling, we integrate relative positional encodings into the spatial
attention module to capture the spatial positions of pixels. The global branch
intends to preserve the global context or structural information. For the the
local branch, which intends to capture the fine-grained information, we perform
uniform partitioning to generate stripes on the conv-layer horizontally. We
retrieve the parts by conducting a soft partition without explicitly

examples are Ramsey's theorem on monochromatic subgraphs and the Erd\H{o}s-Rado
sunflower lemma. Implicit versions of the corresponding total search problems
are known to be PWPP-hard; here ""implici"" means that the collection is
represented by a poly-sized circuit inducing an exponentially large number of
objects.
  We show that several other well-known theorems from extremal combinatorics -
including Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado, Sperner, and Cayley's formula - give rise to
complete problems for PWPP and PPP. This is in contrast to the Ramsey and
Erd\H{o}s-Rado problems, for which establishing inclusion in PWPP has remained
elusive. Besides significantly expanding the set of problems that are complete
for PWPP and PPP, our work identifies some key properties of combinatorial
proofs of existence that can give rise to completeness for these classes.
  Our completeness results rely on efficient encodings for which finding
collisions allows extracting the desired substructure. These encodings are made
possible by the tightness of the bounds for the problems at hand (tighter than
what is known for Ramsey's theorem and the sunflower lemma). Previous
techniques for proving bounds in TFNP invariably made use of structured
algorithms. Such algorithms are not known to exist for the theorems considered
in this work, as their proofs ""from the book"" are non-constructive.

framework based on the multi-antenna ambient backscatter communication (AmBSC)
assisted cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for next-generation
(NG) internet-of-things (IoT) enabled communication networks. Specifically, the
energy-efficiency maximization is achieved for the considered AmBSC-enabled
multi-cluster cooperative IoT NOMA system by optimizing the active-beamforming
vector and power-allocation coefficients (PAC) of IoT NOMA users at the
transmitter, as well as passive-beamforming vector at the multi-antenna
assisted backscatter node. Usually, increasing the number of IoT NOMA users in
each cluster results in inter-cluster interference (ICI) (among different
clusters) and intra-cluster interference (among IoT NOMA users). To combat the
impact of ICI, we exploit a zero-forcing (ZF) based active-beamforming, as well
as an efficient clustering technique at the source node. Further, the effect of
intra-cluster interference is mitigated by exploiting an efficient
power-allocation policy that determines the PAC of IoT NOMA users under the
quality-of-service (QoS), cooperation, SIC decoding, and power-budget
constraints. Moreover, the considered non-convex passive-beamforming problem is
transformed into a standard semi-definite programming (SDP) problem by
exploiting the successive-convex approximation (SCA) approximation, as well as
the difference of convex (DC) programming, where Rank-1 solution of
passive-beamforming is obtained based on the penalty-based method. Furthermore,
the numerical analysis of simulation results demonstrates that the proposed
energy-efficiency maximization algorithm exhibits an efficient performance by
achieving convergence within only a few iterations.

Specifically, we adopt the Fourier transform variant of LIED (FT-LIED) to show

does not preclude structure retrieval from strong-field diffractive patterns.
This theoretical investigation shows that LIED can be well described by the

namely determine all the possible poses (positions and orientations) of a depth

decomposition of $W\times S^1$, which is an extension of the celebrated
trapezoidal decomposition, and which we call rotational trapezoidal
decomposition and present an efficient data structure, which computes the
preimage in an output-sensitive fashion relative to this decomposition: if $k$

residuals. We solve the joint lossy and residual compression problem in the
approach of VAEs, and add autoregressive context modeling of the residuals to
enhance lossless compression performance. In the near-lossless mode, we
quantize the original residuals to satisfy a given $\ell_\infty$ error bound,
and propose a scalable near-lossless compression scheme that works for variable
$\ell_\infty$ bounds instead of training multiple networks. To expedite the
DLPR coding, we increase the degree of algorithm parallelization by a novel
design of coding context, and accelerate the entropy coding with adaptive
residual interval. Experimental results demonstrate that the DLPR coding system
achieves both the state-of-the-art lossless and near-lossless image compression
performance with competitive coding speed.

Joule of laser energy, still limiting its use for a wider range of
applications. The possibility of generating high charge beam while keeping a
good beam quality, stays to be explored. Moreover, despite previous studies
focused on separate physical processes such as beam loading which affects the
uniformity of the acceleration field and thus the energy spread of the trapped
electrons, repulsive force from the rear spike of the bubble which reduces the
transverse momentum $p_\perp$ of the trapped electrons and results in small
beam emmittance, and the laser evolution when travelling in plasma. A more
general investigation of the plasma density parameters on the final beam

of the injected electron beam is directly correlated with the density
transition parameters, which further affects the beam charge and energy spread.
By fine-tuning the plasma density parameters, high-charge (up to several
hundreds of pC) and low-energy-spread (around 1\% FWHM) electron beams can be
obtained. All these results are supported by large-scale three-dimensional

to find defects. However, as the number and possible values of input parameters
increase, the cost of dynamic testing rises.
  This paper examines whether quantum computers (QCs) can help speed up the
dynamic testing of programs written for classical computers (CCs). To
accomplish this, an approach is devised involving the following three steps:
(1) converting a classical program to a quantum program; (2) computing the
number of inputs causing errors, denoted by $K$, using a quantum counting
algorithm; and (3) obtaining the actual values of these inputs using Grover's
search algorithm.
  This approach can accelerate exhaustive and non-exhaustive dynamic testing
techniques. On the CC, the computational complexity of these techniques is
$O(N)$, where $N$ represents the count of combinations of input parameter
values passed to the software under test. In contrast, on the QC, the
complexity is $O(\varepsilon^{-1} \sqrt{N/K})$, where $\varepsilon$ is a
relative error of measuring $K$.
  The paper illustrates how the approach can be applied and discusses its
limitations. Moreover, it provides a toy example executed on a simulator and an
actual QC. This paper may be of interest to academics and practitioners as the
approach presented in the paper may serve as a starting point for exploring the
use of QC for dynamic testing of CC code.

algorithm maintains an ordered list of $n$ elements. An input is a stream of
preferred sets $R_1, R_2, \dots, R_t, \dots$. Upon seeing $R_t$ and without
knowledge of any future sets, an algorithm has to rerank elements (change the
list ordering), so that at least one element of $R_t$ is found near the list
front. The incurred cost is a sum of the list update costs (the number of swaps
of neighboring list elements) and access costs (position of the first element
of $R_t$ on the list). This scenario occurs naturally in applications such as
ordering items in an online shop using aggregated preferences of shop
customers. The theoretical underpinning of this problem is known as Min-Sum Set
Cover.
  Unlike previous work (Fotakis et al., ICALP 2020, NIPS 2020) that mostly
studied the performance of an online algorithm ALG against the static optimal
solution (a single optimal list ordering), in this paper, we study an arguably
harder variant where the benchmark is the provably stronger optimal dynamic
solution OPT (that may also modify the list ordering). In terms of an online
shop, this means that the aggregated preferences of its user base evolve with
time. We construct a computationally efficient randomized algorithm whose
competitive ratio (ALG-to-OPT cost ratio) is $O(r^2)$ and prove the existence
of a deterministic $O(r^4)$-competitive algorithm. Here, $r$ is the maximum
cardinality of sets $R_t$. This is the first algorithm whose ratio does not
depend on $n$: the previously best algorithm for this problem was $O(r^{3/2}
\cdot \sqrt{n})$-competitive and $\Omega(r)$ is a lower bound on the
performance of any deterministic online algorithm.

meteorological services issue weather warnings to the general public. These
warnings rely heavily on forecasts issued by underlying prediction systems.
When deciding which prediction system(s) to utilise to construct warnings, it
is important to compare systems in their ability to forecast the occurrence and
severity of extreme weather events. However, evaluating forecasts for extreme
events is known to be a challenging task. This is exacerbated further by the
fact that high-impact weather often manifests as a result of several
confounding features, a realisation that has led to considerable research on
so-called compound weather events. Both univariate and multivariate methods are
therefore required to evaluate forecasts for high-impact weather. In this
paper, we discuss weighted verification tools, which allow particular outcomes
to be emphasised during forecast evaluation. We review and compare different
approaches to construct weighted scoring rules, both in a univariate and
multivariate setting, and we leverage existing results on weighted scores to
introduce weighted probability integral transform (PIT) histograms, allowing
forecast calibration to be assessed conditionally on particular outcomes having
occurred. To illustrate the practical benefit afforded by these weighted

Recent high precision measurements of jet substructure in proton-proton (pp)

gravitational theories whose emergent space is the target space of a
holographic dual. In the well studied duality of two-dimensional non-critical
string theory and $c=1$ matrix model, this question has been studied earlier
using fermionic many-body theory in the space of eigenvalues. The entanglement
entropy of a subregion of the eigenvalue space, which is the target space
entanglement in the matrix model, is finite, with the scale being provided by
the local Fermi momentum. The Fermi momentum is, however, a position-dependent
string coupling, as is clear in the collective field theory formulation. This
suggests that the finiteness is a non-perturbative effect. We provide evidence
for this expectation by an explicit calculation in the collective field theory
of matrix quantum mechanics with vanishing potential. The leading term in the
cumulant expansion of the entanglement entropy is calculated using exact
eigenstates and eigenvalues of the collective Hamiltonian, yielding a finite
result, in precise agreement with the fermion answer. Treating the theory
perturbatively, we show that each term in the perturbation expansion is UV
divergent. However the series can be resummed, yielding the exact finite
result. Our results indicate that the finiteness of the entanglement entropy
for higher dimensional string theories is non-perturbative as well, with the
scale provided by the Newton constant.

clarifying fundamental aspects of deep learning. Yet the ultimate goal remains
elusive: we lack a complete theoretical framework to predict practically
relevant scores, such as the train and test accuracy, from knowledge of the

the number of units $N_\ell$ in each hidden layer far exceeds the number $P$ of
training examples. This idealisation, however, blatantly departs from the
reality of deep learning practice, where training sets are larger than the
widths of the networks. Here, we show one way to overcome these limitations.
The partition function for fully-connected architectures, which encodes
information about the trained models, can be computed analytically with the
toolset of statistical mechanics. The computation holds in the ""thermodynamic
limit'' where both $N_\ell$ and $P$ are large and their ratio $\alpha_\ell =
P/N_\ell$, which vanishes in the infinite-width limit, is now finite and
generic. This advance allows us to obtain (i) a closed formula for the

behavior of polycrystalline metals, where microstructural variations dictate
the expected material strength. Until now, the lack of microstructural
variability in available datasets precluded the development of robust
physics-based theoretical models that account for randomness of
microstructures. To address this, we have developed a probabilistic machine
learning framework to predict the flow stress as a function of variations in
the microstructural features. In this framework, we first generated an
extensive database of flow stress for a set of over a million randomly sampled
microstructural features, and then applied a combination of mixture models and
neural networks on the generated database to quantify the flow stress
distribution and the relative importance of microstructural features. The
results show excellent agreement with experiments and demonstrate that across a
wide range of grain size, the conventional Hall-Petch relationship is
statistically valid for correlating the strength to the average grain size and
its comparative importance versus other microstructural features. This work
demonstrates the power of the machine-learning based probabilistic approach for
predicting polycrystalline strength, directly accounting for microstructural
variations, resulting in a tool to guide the design of polycrystalline metallic
materials with superior strength, and a method for overcoming sparse data
limitations.

always robust in practice. For instance, a convolutional neuron network (CNN)
model for classification tasks often performs unsatisfactorily in classifying
some particular classes of objects. In this work, we are concerned with
patching the weak part of a CNN model instead of improving it through the
costly retraining of the entire model. Inspired by the fundamental concepts of
modularization and composition in software engineering, we propose a compressed
modularization approach, CNNSplitter, which decomposes a strong CNN model for
$N$-class classification into $N$ smaller CNN modules. Each module is a
sub-model containing a part of the convolution kernels of the strong model. To
patch a weak CNN model that performs unsatisfactorily on a target class (TC),
we compose the weak CNN model with the corresponding module obtained from a
strong CNN model. The ability of the weak CNN model to recognize the TC can
thus be improved through patching. Moreover, the ability to recognize non-TCs
is also improved, as the samples misclassified as TC could be classified as
non-TCs correctly. Experimental results with two representative CNNs on three
widely-used datasets show that the averaged improvement on the TC in terms of
precision and recall are 12.54% and 2.14%, respectively. Moreover, patching
improves the accuracy of non-TCs by 1.18%. The results demonstrate that
CNNSplitter can patch a weak CNN model through modularization and composition,
thus providing a new solution for developing robust CNN models.

scales that need to be factored in simulation. Kinetic models using statistical
methods and fluid methods are examined. Both have their advantages, and
Vlasiator uses a combination of these methods. Modeling electrons kinetically
requires a resolution orders of magnitude greater than ions, so ions are
modeled kinetically and electrons as a fluid. Targeted refinement used in
Vlasiator is introduced as a method to save memory and computation. Due to the
structure of the magnetosphere, the required resolution isn't uniform in the
simulation region. Regions where a higher resolution is required can be refined
such that the refined area is given as simulation parameters. Adaptive mesh
refinement based on the simulation data is introduced as an evolution of this
method. Refinement is done based on dimensionless gradients of different
variables; regions where the examined variables change rapidly are refined, and
conversely regions with little change are coarsened. Test results show adaptive
refinement to be a promising way to improve Vlasiator. Refinement parameters
produce results similar to the static method, while giving somewhat different
refinement regions. A further goal is runtime refinement.

Since, not all nodes are connected directly to each other, they can use a

frozen during the channel's lifespan. Spending and receiving transactions will
shift the balance to one side of the channel. A channel becomes unbalanced when
there is not sufficient balance in one direction. In this case, we say the
effective lifespan of the channel has ended.
  In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to predict the expected

channels. We also discuss the effect of certain characteristics of payment
channels on their lifespan. Our case study on a snapshot of the Lightning
