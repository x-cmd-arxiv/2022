is therefore relevant to find efficient ways of using insureds' driving data.
Applying anomaly detection to vehicles' trip summaries, we develop a method
allowing to derive a ""routine"" and a ""peculiarity"" anomaly profile for each
vehicle. To this end, anomaly detection algorithms are used to compute a
routine and a peculiarity anomaly score for each trip a vehicle makes. The
former measures the anomaly degree of the trip compared to the other trips made
by the concerned vehicle, while the latter measures its anomaly degree compared
to trips made by any vehicle. The resulting anomaly scores vectors are used as
routine and peculiarity profiles. Features are then extracted from these
profiles, for which we investigate the predictive power in the claim
classification framework. Using real data, we find that features extracted from
the vehicles' peculiarity profile improve classification.

ultra-massive Machine Type Communications(umMTC). In particular, wireless power
transfer (WPT) assisted communication is deployed in non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) downlink networks to realize spectrum and energy cooperation.
This paper focuses on joint robust beamforming design to maximize the energy
efficiency of WPT-assisted D2D communications in multiple-input single-output
(MISO)-NOMA downlink networks. To efficiently address the formulated
non-concave energy efficiency maximization problem, a pure fractional
programming (PFP) algorithm is proposed, where the time switching coefficient
of the WPT device and the beamforming vectors of the base station are
alternatively optimized by applying the Dinkelbach method and quadratic
transform respectively. To prove the optimality of the proposed algorithm, the
partial exhaustive search algorithm is proposed as a benchmark. A deep
reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method is also applied to directly solve the
non-concave problem. The proposed PFP algorithm and the DDPG-based algorithm
are compared in the presence of different channel estimation errors. Simulation
results show that the proposed PFP algorithm outperforms the DDPG-based
algorithm if perfect channel state information (CSI) can be obtained or just
have minor errors, while the DDPG-based algorithm is more robust when the
channel estimation accuracy is unsatisfactory. On the other hand, one can
conclude that the NOMA scheme can provide a higher gain than OMA on the energy
efficiency of the WPT-assisted D2D communication in legacy multi-user downlink
networks.

autonomous driving. LiDAR point clouds have accurate spatial and geometry
information, while RGB images provide textural and color data for context
reasoning. To exploit LiDAR and cameras jointly, existing fusion methods tend
to align each 3D point to only one projected image pixel based on calibration,
namely one-to-one mapping. However, the performance of these approaches highly
relies on the calibration quality, which is sensitive to the temporal and
spatial synchronization of sensors. Therefore, we propose a Dynamic Cross
Attention (DCA) module with a novel one-to-many cross-modality mapping that
learns multiple offsets from the initial projection towards the neighborhood
and thus develops tolerance to calibration error. Moreover, a \textit{dynamic
query enhancement} is proposed to perceive the model-independent calibration,
which further strengthens DCA's tolerance to the initial misalignment. The
whole fusion architecture named Dynamic Cross Attention Network (DCAN) exploits
multi-level image features and adapts to multiple representations of point
clouds, which allows DCA to serve as a plug-in fusion module. Extensive
experiments on nuScenes and KITTI prove DCA's effectiveness. The proposed DCAN
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the nuScenes detection challenge.

frequency radio luminosity from the extended jet, maximum speed of radio knots
observed in the VLBA monitoring of the pc-scale jets, kinetic energy of
electrons in the jet deduced from the best-fit theoretical models of their
spectral energy distribution, and gamma-ray luminosity with and without beaming

probe the intrinsic correlation between the disk and jet power, we compute the
partial correlation coefficient as well as the correlation in small redshift

weaker. In the cases, in which the common redshift dependence does not affect

decision processes (MDPs), with preferences over temporally extended goals.
Prior work on temporal planning with preferences assumes that the user
preferences form a total order, meaning that every pair of outcomes are
comparable with each other. In this work, we consider the case where the
preferences over possible outcomes are a partial order rather than a total
order. We first introduce a variant of deterministic finite automaton, referred
to as a preference DFA, for specifying the user's preferences over temporally
extended goals. Based on the order theory, we translate the preference DFA to a
preference relation over policies for probabilistic planning in a labeled MDP.
In this treatment, a most preferred policy induces a weak-stochastic
nondominated probability distribution over the finite paths in the MDP. The
proposed planning algorithm hinges on the construction of a multi-objective
MDP. We prove that a weak-stochastic nondominated policy given the preference
specification is Pareto-optimal in the constructed multi-objective MDP, and
vice versa. Throughout the paper, we employ a running example to demonstrate
the proposed preference specification and solution approaches. We show the
efficacy of our algorithm using the example with detailed analysis, and then
discuss possible future directions.

non-smooth regularizers, such as the commonly used $\ell_1$, elastic net, or
nuclear norm penalties. We also provide generalization, deletion capacity, and
unlearning guarantees that are consistent with state of the art methods. Across
a variety of benchmark datasets, our algorithm empirically improves upon the
runtime of prior methods while maintaining the same memory requirements and
test accuracy. Finally, we open a new direction of inquiry by proving that all
approximate unlearning algorithms introduced so far fail to unlearn in problem
settings where common hyperparameter tuning methods, such as cross-validation,
have been used to select models.

set of a given graph is partitioned into safe and unsafe edges. A vertex pair
$(s,t)$ is $(p,q)$-flex-connected if $s$ and $t$ have $p$ edge-connectivity
even after the removal of any $q$ unsafe edges. Given a graph $G$, the goal is
to choose a min-cost subgraph $H$ of $G$ that has desired flex-connectivity for
a given set of vertex pairs. This model generalizes the well-studied
edge-connectivity based network design, however, even special cases are
provably much harder to approximate.
  The approximability of network design in this model has been mainly studied
for two settings of interest: (i) single pair setting under the names FTP and
FTF (fault tolerant path and fault tolerant flow), (ii) spanning setting under
the name FGC (flexible graph connectivity). There have been several positive
results in these papers. However, despite similarity to the well-known network
design problems, this new model has been challenging to design approximation
algorithms for, especially when $p,q \ge 2$. We obtain two results that advance
our understanding of algorithm design in this model.
  1. We obtain a $5$-approximation for the $(2,2)$-flex-connectivity for a
single pair $(s,t)$. Previously no non-trivial approximation was known for this
setting.
  2. We obtain $O(p)$ approximation for $(p,2)$ and $(p,3)$-FGC for any $p \ge

transform the inexplicit global loss minimization problem into a tractable one

comprehend and are especially detrimental to classes of applications that are
iterative and/or long-running, and therefore their timely mitigation is
important for quantum advantage in real-world applications. The most popular
examples of iterative long-running quantum applications are variational quantum
algorithms (VQAs). Iteratively, VQA's classical optimizer evaluates circuit
candidates on an objective function and picks the best circuits towards
achieving the application's target. Noise fluctuation can cause a significant
transient impact on the objective function estimation of the VQA iterations /
tuning candidates. This can severely affect VQA tuning and, by extension, its
accuracy and convergence.
  This paper proposes QISMET: Quantum Iteration Skipping to Mitigate Error
Transients, to navigate the dynamic noise landscape of VQAs. QISMET actively
avoids instances of high fluctuating noise which are predicted to have a
significant transient error impact on specific VQA iterations. To achieve this,
QISMET estimates transient error in VQA iterations and designs a controller to
keep the VQA tuning faithful to the transient-free scenario. By doing so,
QISMET efficiently mitigates a large portion of the transient noise impact on
VQAs and is able to improve the fidelity by 1.3x-3x over a traditional VQA
baseline, with 1.6-2.4x improvement over alternative approaches, across
different applications and machines. Further, to diligently analyze the effects
of transients, this work also builds transient noise models for target VQA
applications from observing real machine transients. These are then integrated
with the Qiskit simulator.

Approach (2SA) that estimates the legitimacy of robots based on received trust
observations, and provably minimizes the probability of detection error in the
worst-case malicious attack. Here, the proportion of malicious robots is known
but arbitrary. For the case of an unknown proportion of malicious robots, we
develop the Adversarial Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (A-GLRT) that uses
both the reported robot measurements and trust observations to estimate the
trustworthiness of robots, their reporting strategy, and the correct hypothesis
simultaneously. We exploit special problem structure to show that this approach
remains computationally tractable despite several unknown problem parameters.
We deploy both algorithms in a hardware experiment where a group of robots

our queries we use a model called Annotated Automata, an extension of regular
automata that allows annotations on letters. This model extends the notion of
Regular Spanners as it allows arbitrarily long outputs. Our main result is an
algorithm which evaluates such a query by enumerating all results with
output-linear delay after a preprocessing phase which takes linear time on the
size of the SLP, and cubic time over the size of the automaton. This is an
improvement over Schmid and Schweikardt's result, which, with the same
preprocessing time, enumerates with a delay which is logarithmic on the size of
the uncompressed document. We achieve this through a persistent data structure
named Enumerable Compact Sets with Shifts which guarantees output-linear delay
under certain restrictions. These results imply constant-delay enumeration
algorithms in the context of regular spanners. Further, we use an extension of
annotated automata which utilizes succinctly encoded annotations to save an
exponential factor from previous results that dealt with constant-delay
enumeration over vset automata. Lastly, we extend our results in the same

The equilibrium turbulence spectrum is determined by a balance of CR excitation

powders. The samples had a coarse-grained (CG) surface layers of ~0.3 mm in
thickness and ultrafine-grained (UFG) central parts consisting of WC with a
small fraction of W2C. The creep tests were conducted in two regimes: (Mode #1)
holding at different temperatures (1300-1375C) at 70 MPa; (Mode #2) tests at
different stresses (50, 70, 90 MPa) at 1325C. Tests in Mode #1 were done to
determine the effective creep activation energy Qcr while tests in Mode #2 - to
determine the coefficient n in the power law creep equation. The increasing of
the fraction of the W2C particles from 1.7 up to 4% was found to result in a
decrease in the Qcr from 17.5 down to 13 kTm. The coefficient n equals to
3.1-3.7. The Qcr in the WC sintered from nanopowders was shown to be 31 kTm.
This value is 1.5-2 times greater than the Qcr in the UFG samples obtained by
SPS from commercial powders. The increased fraction of the W2C formed when
sintering the nanopowders with increased adsorbed oxygen concentration was
suggested to be one of the origins of the increase in the Qcr when testing the
UFG samples. The mechanical removing of the CG layers from the surfaces of the
tungsten carbide sample was shown to result in an accelerated creep,
insufficient decrease in the Qcr and coefficient n to 2.5-2.6. The creep rate
of the samples was suggested to be determined simultaneously by the creep
process in the CG surface layers and the creep process in the UFG central parts

intensity of carbon diffusion in the WC crystal lattice while the creep rate in

normalization for numeric. The presented study sought to validate those
defaults by way of benchmarking on a series of diverse data sets by encoding
variations with tuned gradient boosted learning. We found that on average our
chosen defaults were top performers both from a tuning duration and a model
performance standpoint. Another key finding was that one hot encoding did not
perform in a manner consistent with suitability to serve as a categoric default
in comparison to categoric binarization. We present here these and further
benchmarks.

Although efficient sequential convex hull algorithms exist, and are constantly

image processing for virtual reality, among others, where fast response times
are required. In this work we propose a parallel GPU-based adaptation of
heaphull, which is a state of the art CPU algorithm that computes the convex
hull by first doing a efficient filtering stage followed by the actual convex
hull computation. More specifically, this work parallelizes the filtering
stage, adapting it to the GPU programming model as a series of parallel
reductions. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed implementation
significantly improves the performance of the convex hull computation, reaching
up to $4\times$ of speedup over the sequential CPU-based heaphull and between
$3\times \sim 4\times$ over existing GPU based approaches.

  We find various topologically nontrivial configurations of the confined
Clebsch field responsible for vortex sheets and lines. In particular, a stable
vortex sheet family is discovered, but its anomalous dissipation vanishes as
$\sqrt{\nu}$.
  Topologically stable stationary singular flows, which we call Kelvinons, are
introduced. They have a conserved velocity circulation $\Gamma_\alpha$ around
the loop $C$ and another one $\Gamma_\beta$ for an infinitesimal closed loop
$\tilde C$ encircling $C$, leading to a finite helicity. The anomalous
dissipation has a finite limit, which we computed analytically.
  The Kelvinon is responsible for asymptotic PDF tails of velocity circulation,
\textbf{perfectly matching numerical simulations}.
  The loop equation for circulation PDF as functional of the loop shape is
derived and studied. This equation is \textbf{exactly} equivalent to the
Schr\""odinger equation in loop space, with viscosity $\nu$ playing the role of
Planck's constant.
  Kelvinons are fixed points of the loop equation at WKB limit $\nu \rightarrow
0$. The anomalous Hamiltonian for the Kelvinons contains a large parameter
$\log \frac{|\Gamma_\beta|}{\nu}$. The leading powers of this parameter can be
summed up, leading to familiar asymptotic freedom, like in QCD. In particular,
the so-called multifractal scaling laws are, as in QCD, modified by the powers
of the logarithm.

system with two classes of arrivals: requests for entangled pair of qubits
between two nodes, and qubits from each node that can be used to serve the
requests. An important feature of this model is that qubits decohere and so
abandon over time. In contrast to classical server-based queueing models, the
combination of queueing, server-less multi-way matching, and abandonment make
the analysis a challenging problem. The primary focus of this paper is to study
a simple system consisting of two types of requests and three types of qubits
operating under a Max-Weight policy.
  In this setting, we characterize the stability region under the Max-Weight
policy by adopting a two-time scale fluid limit to get a handle on the
abandonments. In particular, we show that Max-Weight is throughput optimal and
that it can achieve throughputs larger than the ones that can be achieved by
non-idling policies when the requests are infinitely backlogged. Moreover,
despite the use of the Max-Weight policy, we show that there can be a
counter-intuitive behavior in the system: the longest requests queue can have a
positive drift for some time even if the overall system is stable.

such, t-SR directly considers the time horizon of temporally extended action

that in environments with dynamic reward structure, t-SR is able to leverage
both the flexibility of the successor representation and the abstraction

gridworld environments, t-SR optimally adapts learnt policies far faster than
comparable value-based, model-free reinforcement learning methods. We also show

many-body systems and quantum circuits. Most tensor methods rely on the fact
that we can eventually contract the tensor network to obtain the final result.
While the contraction operation itself is trivial, its execution time is highly
dependent on the order in which the contractions are performed. To this end,
one tries to find beforehand an optimal order in which the contractions should
be performed. However, there is a drawback: the general problem of finding the
optimal contraction order is NP-complete. Therefore, one must settle for a
mixture of exponential algorithms for small problems, e.g., $n \leq 20$, and
otherwise hope for good contraction orders. For this reason, previous research

structures of type III radio bursts observed in the metric to decametric
wavelengths. Majority of explanations of the structured radio emission involve
the propagation of electron beam through the strongly inhomogeneous plasma in
the low corona. Until now only few studies of single type III bursts with fine
structures, observed in the hecto-kilometric wavelengths, were reported. Aims:
Herein we report about existence of numerous structured type III radio bursts
observed during the STEREO era by all three WAVES instruments on board STEREO
A, B, and Wind. The aim of the study is to report, classify structured type III
bursts, and present the characteristics of their fine structures. The final
goal is to try to understand the physical mechanism responsible for the
generation of structured radio emission. Methods: In this study we used data
from all available spacecraft, specifically the STEREO and the Wind spacecraft.
We employ 1D density models to obtain the speed of the source of type III radio
emission, the electron beam. We also perform spectral analysis of the fine
structures in order to compare their characteristics with the metric-decametric
fine structures. Results: The presented similarities of the type III fine
structures in the metric to decametric and interplanetary wavelengths indicate
that the physical processes responsible for the generation of structured type
III radio bursts could be the same, at the heights, all the way from the low
corona to the interplanetary range. We show that the observed structuring and
intermittent nature of the type III bursts can be explained by the variation in
the level of density fluctuations, at different distances from the Sun.

slip bond behavior), nature has developed bonds that do the opposite: their
lifetime increases as force is applied. While such catch bonds have been
studied quite extensively at the single molecule level and in adhesive
contacts, recent work has shown that they are also abundantly present as
crosslinkers in the actin cytoskeleton. However, their role and the mechanism
by which they operate in these networks have remained unclear. Here, we present
computer simulations that show how polymer networks crosslinked with either
slip or catch bonds respond to mechanical stress. Our results reveal that catch
bonding may be required to protect dynamic networks against fracture, in
particular for mobile linkers that can diffuse freely after unbinding. While
mobile slip bonds lead to networks that are very weak at high stresses, mobile
catch bonds accumulate in high stress regions and thereby stabilize cracks,
leading to a more ductile fracture behavior. This allows cells to combine
structural adaptivity at low stresses with mechanical stability at high
stresses.

becoming increasingly important. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is
a popular formal verification tool for providing these guarantees, since it can
handle general nonlinear system dynamics, bounded adversarial system
disturbances, and state and input constraints. However, it involves solving a
PDE, whose computational and memory complexity scales exponentially with
respect to the state dimensionality, making its direct use on large-scale
systems intractable. A recently proposed method called DeepReach overcomes this
challenge by leveraging a sinusoidal neural PDE solver for high-dimensional
reachability problems, whose computational requirements scale with the
complexity of the underlying reachable tube rather than the state space
dimension. Unfortunately, neural networks can make errors and thus the computed
solution may not be safe, which falls short of achieving our overarching goal
to provide formal safety assurances. In this work, we propose a method to
compute an error bound for the DeepReach solution. This error bound can then be
used for reachable tube correction, resulting in a safe approximation of the
true reachable tube. We also propose a scenario-based optimization approach to
compute a probabilistic bound on this error correction for general nonlinear
dynamical systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in
obtaining probabilistically safe reachable tubes for high-dimensional
rocket-landing and multi-vehicle collision-avoidance problems.

methods when numerous instances are to be solved. Previous works that
concentrate on solving the wave equation by neural networks consider either a
single velocity model or multiple simple velocity models, which is restricted
in practice. Instead, inspired by the idea of operator learning, this work
leverages the Fourier neural operator (FNO) to effectively learn the frequency
domain seismic wavefields under the context of variable velocity models. We
also propose a new framework paralleled Fourier neural operator (PFNO) for
efficiently training the FNO-based solver given multiple source locations and
frequencies. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high accuracy of both FNO
and PFNO with complicated velocity models in the OpenFWI datasets. Furthermore,
the cross-dataset generalization test verifies that PFNO adapts to
out-of-distribution velocity models. Moreover, PFNO has robust performance in
the presence of random noise in the labels. Finally, PFNO admits higher
computational efficiency on large-scale testing datasets than the traditional
finite-difference method. The aforementioned advantages endow the FNO-based

present Paraphrasing-to-Captioning (P2C), a two-stage learning framework for

With P2C, the captioning model first learns paraphrasing from a language model
pre-trained on text-only corpus, allowing expansion of the word bank for
improving linguistic fluency. To further enforce the output caption
sufficiently describing the visual content of the input image, we perform
self-paraphrasing for the captioning model with fidelity and adequacy

local, sequential decision-making problem under incomplete information,
formulating AMR as a partially observable Markov decision process. Using a deep
reinforcement learning approach, we train policy networks for AMR strategy
directly from numerical simulation. The training process does not require an
exact solution or a high-fidelity ground truth to the partial differential
equation at hand, nor does it require a pre-computed training dataset. The
local nature of our reinforcement learning formulation allows the policy
network to be trained inexpensively on much smaller problems than those on
which they are deployed. The methodology is not specific to any particular
partial differential equation, problem dimension, or numerical discretization,
and can flexibly incorporate diverse problem physics. To that end, we apply the
approach to a diverse set of partial differential equations, using a variety of

understand such interactions, computers need to reconstruct these from cameras

occlusion between the body and objects, motion blur, depth/scale ambiguities,
and the low image resolution of hands and graspable object parts. To make the

the body, or on interacting bodies, ignoring hands. The GRAB dataset addresses
dexterous whole-body interaction but uses marker-based MoCap and lacks images,
while BEHAVE captures video of body object interaction but lacks hand detail.
We address the limitations of prior work with InterCap, a novel method that
reconstructs interacting whole-bodies and objects from multi-view RGB-D data,
using the parametric whole-body model SMPL-X and known object meshes. To tackle
the above challenges, InterCap uses two key observations: (i) Contact between
the hand and object can be used to improve the pose estimation of both. (ii)
Azure Kinect sensors allow us to set up a simple multi-view RGB-D capture
system that minimizes the effect of occlusion while providing reasonable
inter-camera synchronization. With this method we capture the InterCap dataset,
which contains 10 subjects (5 males and 5 females) interacting with 10 objects
of various sizes and affordances, including contact with the hands or feet. In
total, InterCap has 223 RGB-D videos, resulting in 67,357 multi-view frames,

ratio: 1) previous work demonstrated the Q/S ratio increases at smaller sizes
down to H<16, but we find a sharp increase near H=19 after which the ratio
decreases monotonically 2) in agreement with many previous studies, the Q/S
ratio increases with decreasing perihelion distance, and we find it is non-zero
for larger perihelia greater than 1.2AU, 3) as a new finding our work reveals
the Q/S ratio has a sharp, significant peak near 5 degrees orbital inclination,
and 4) we confirm previous findings that the Q/S ratio is higher for objects
that have the possibility of encounter with Earth and Venus versus those that
don't, however this finding cannot be distinguished from the perihelion trend.
No single resurfacing mechanism can explain all of these trends, so multiple
mechanisms are required. It is likely that a combination of all four

units, also known as subplots, nested within groups known as whole plots. It
assigns the whole-plot intervention by a cluster randomization at the

randomization at the subplot level. The randomization mechanism guarantees
covariate balance on average at both the whole-plot and subplot levels, and
ensures consistent inference of the average treatment effects by the
Horvitz--Thompson and Hajek estimators. However, covariate imbalance often
occurs in finite samples and subjects subsequent inference to possibly large
variability and conditional bias. Rerandomization is widely used in the design
stage of randomized experiments to improve covariate balance. The existing
literature on rerandomization nevertheless focuses on designs with treatments
assigned at either the unit or the group level, but not both, leaving the
corresponding theory for rerandomization in split-plot designs an open problem.
To fill the gap, we propose two strategies for conducting rerandomization in
split-plot designs based on the Mahalanobis distance and establish the
corresponding design-based theory. We show that rerandomization can improve the
asymptotic efficiency of the Horvitz--Thompson and Hajek estimators. Moreover,
we propose two covariate adjustment methods in the analysis stage, which can
further improve the asymptotic efficiency when combined with rerandomization.

reconstructing such local activity that, while small in signal strength, is the
cause of subsequent global activities that have larger signal strength. Our
central innovation is to approach this by explicitly modeling and disentangling
how the latent state of a system is influenced by potential hidden internal
interventions. In a novel neural formulation of state-space models (SSMs), we
first introduce causal-effect modeling of the latent dynamics via a system of
interacting neural ODEs that separately describes 1) the continuous-time
dynamics of the internal intervention, and 2) its effect on the trajectory of
the system's native state. Because the intervention can not be directly
observed but have to be disentangled from the observed subsequent effect, we
integrate knowledge of the native intervention-free dynamics of a system, and
infer the hidden intervention by assuming it to be responsible for differences
observed between the actual and hypothetical intervention-free dynamics. We

the latent scores, we utilize the Continuum Regression (CR), which provides a
unified framework that covers the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), the Partial

high-performance devices, in 5d-oxides devices remains far behind their
3d-oxides analogs. The carriers mobility in these oxides is significantly
hampered by the inevitable presence of defects generated during the growth
process. Here, we report very high mobility ($\sim$ 22650
cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) of 5d-2DES confined at the LaAlO$_3$/KTaO$_3$

LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ and $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ systems in the same
carrier-density range, is achieved using the ionic-liquid gating at room
temperature. We postulate that the ionic-liquid gating affects the oxygen
vacancies and efficiently reduces any disorder at the interface. Investigating
density and mobility in a broad range of back-gate voltage, we reveal that the
mobility follows the power-law $\mu \propto n^{1.2}$, indicating the very high
quality of ionic-liquid-gated LaAlO$_3$/KTaO$_3$ devices, consistent with our

automatically mining accurate structure information. However, most of existing
CNNs depend on enlarging depth of designed networks to obtain better denoising
performance, which may cause training difficulty. In this paper, we propose a
multi-stage image denoising CNN with the wavelet transform (MWDCNN) via three
stages, i.e., a dynamic convolutional block (DCB), two cascaded wavelet
transform and enhancement blocks (WEBs) and a residual block (RB). DCB uses a
dynamic convolution to dynamically adjust parameters of several convolutions
for making a tradeoff between denoising performance and computational costs.
WEB uses a combination of signal processing technique (i.e., wavelet
transformation) and discriminative learning to suppress noise for recovering
more detailed information in image denoising. To further remove redundant
features, RB is used to refine obtained features for improving denoising
effects and reconstruct clean images via improved residual dense architectures.
Experimental results show that the proposed MWDCNN outperforms some popular
denoising methods in terms of quantitative and qualitative analysis. Codes are

particularly true when complex, time-dependent models are considered. Motivated
by improvements in the computational efficiency of the current PWN models that
were obtained in the last years, we here explore the inclusion of automatic
fitting algorithms into a fully time-dependent model. Incorporating an
efficient fitting tool based on the Nelder-Mead algorithm, we blindly find
fitting solutions for the Crab nebula and 3C 58 with a time-dependent radiation
model to compute the spectral and dynamical evolution of young and middle-aged
PWNe. This inclusion allows us, in addition of more faithfully determining the
quality of the fit, to tackle whether there exist degeneracy in the selected
PWNe models. We find both for Crab and 3C58, that the fits are well determined,
and that no other significantly different set of model parameters is able to
cope with experimental data equally well. The code is also able to consider the
system's age as a free parameter, recursively determining all other needed
magnitudes depending on age accordingly. We use this feature to consider
whether a detailed multi-frequency spectra can constrain the nebula age,
finding that in fact this is the case for the two PWNe studied.

through the ""collapse"" of the state of a system when it is measured. Among
other interpretational problems, this conception is particularly unappealing
for relativistic quantum mechanics, since such a ""collapse"" violates the
relativity of simultaneity. As a result, interpretations of relativistic
quantum mechanics often take an Everettian ""many worlds"" approach in which
collapse does not happen. But this then leads to difficulties in how to even
define probabilities over different possible ""worlds"". The present paper
addresses this difficulty by providing a relativistic model of measurement, in
which the state of the universe is decomposed into decoherent histories of
measurements recorded within it. Zurek's concept of envariance can be
generalized to this context of relativistic spacetime, giving an objective
definition of the probability of any one of these quantum histories, consistent
with Born's rule. This then leads to the statistics of any repeated experiment
also tending to follow the Born rule as the number of repetitions increases.
The wave functions that we actually use for such experiments are local
reductions of very coarse-grained superpositions of universal eigenstates, and
their ""collapse"" can be re-interpreted as simply an update based on additional

ensemble learning to neural networks and to reinforcement learning (RL).
However, there is still much to be done to improve the efficiency of such
ensemble models. In this work, we present Diverse Ensembles for Fast Transfer
in RL (DEFT), a new ensemble-based method for reinforcement learning in highly
multimodal environments and improved transfer to unseen environments. The
algorithm is broken down into two main phases: training of ensemble members,
and synthesis (or fine-tuning) of the ensemble members into a policy that works
in a new environment.
  The first phase of the algorithm involves training regular policy gradient or
actor-critic agents in parallel but adding a term to the loss that encourages
these policies to differ from each other. This causes the individual unimodal
agents to explore the space of optimal policies and capture more of the
multimodality of the environment than a single actor could. The second phase of
DEFT involves synthesizing the component policies into a new policy that works
well in a modified environment in one of two ways. To evaluate the performance
of DEFT, we start with a base version of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
algorithm and extend it with the modifications for DEFT. Our results show that
the pretraining phase is effective in producing diverse policies in multimodal
environments. DEFT often converges to a high reward significantly faster than
alternatives, such as random initialization without DEFT and fine-tuning of
ensemble members.
  While there is certainly more work to be done to analyze DEFT theoretically
and extend it to be even more robust, we believe it provides a strong framework
for capturing multimodality in environments while still using RL methods with
simple policy representations.

is based on treating PBH as a perturbation term, by assuming that the PBH is
far away from the Earth-Moon binary (far greater than 1 AU) and the mass of the
PBH is small (less than the lunar mass). This perturbation treatment allows us
to develop a framework to calculate the orbits of a generic binary system such
as the Earth-Moon binary system. Our numerical results show that the Earth-Moon
distance is sensitive to the initial values of the system. In most cases, the
long-duration interactions between the PBH and the Earth-Moon system can induce
lasting imprints on the Earth-Moon's orbit, and these imprints can accumulate
over time, eventually giving rise to observable deviations which can be used to
infer the properties of the PBH.

$\imath$quiver, the $\imath$Hall algebra is commutative and connections to
$\imath$Hall-Littlewood symmetric functions are developed. In case of
$\imath$quivers of diagonal type, our construction amounts to a reformulation
of Bridgeland-Hall algebra realization of the Drinfeld double quantum groups

code starting from a 20~$M_\odot$ progenitor with different rotation rates, and
using the RDF equation of state from \textit{Bastian} 2021 that prescribes the
HQPT. Rotation is found to delay the onset of the HQPT and the resulting
dynamical collapse of the protocompact star (PCS) due to the centrifugal
support. All models with the HQPT experience a second bounce shock which leads
to a successful explosion. The oblate PCS as deformed by rotation gives rise to
strong gravitational-wave (GW) emission around the second bounce with a peak
amplitude larger by a factor of $\sim10$ than that around the first bounce. The
breakout of the second bounce shock at the neutrinosphere produces a
$\bar{\nu}_e$-rich neutrino burst with a luminosity of serveral
10$^{53}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. In rapidly rotating models the PCS pulsation following
the second bounce generates oscillations in the neutrino signal after the
burst. In the fastest rotating model with the HQPT, a clear correlation is
found between the oscillations in the GW and neutrino signals immediately after
the second bounce. In addition, the HQPT-induced collapse leads to a jump in
the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational energy ($\beta$) of the
PCS, for which persistent GW emission may arise due to secular nonaxisymmetric
instabilities.

attracting attention in the context of smart cities. In smart monitoring,
object detection from point cloud data acquired by 3D image sensors is
implemented for detecting moving objects such as vehicles and pedestrians to
ensure safety on the road. However, the features of point cloud data are
diversified due to the characteristics of light detection and ranging (LIDAR)
units used as 3D image sensors or the install position of the 3D image sensors.
Although a variety of deep learning (DL) models for object detection from point
cloud data have been studied to date, no research has considered how to use
multiple DL models in accordance with the features of the point cloud data. In
this work, we propose a feature-based model selection framework that creates
various DL models by using multiple DL methods and by utilizing training data
with pseudo incompleteness generated by two artificial techniques: sampling and
noise adding. It selects the most suitable DL model for the object detection
task in accordance with the features of the point cloud data acquired in the
real environment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework,
we compare the performance of multiple DL models using benchmark datasets
created from the KITTI dataset and present example results of object detection
obtained through a real outdoor experiment. Depending on the situation, the
detection accuracy varies up to 32% between DL models, which confirms the
importance of selecting an appropriate DL model according to the situation.

it with a prototype-based model. BRAIxProtoPNet++ distills the knowledge of the
global model when training the prototype-based model with the goal of
increasing the classification accuracy of the ensemble. Moreover, we propose an

consistency. Direct comparison with the measured meteorological data of
temperature and precipitation distributions reveals that integrating
climatologically important physical information improves the downscaling

systems. In the design of cellular automata, the most difficult task is to find
the transformation rules that describe the temporal evolution or pattern of a
modelled system. A CA with weights(CAW) yields transition rules algorithm is
proposed in this paper, which have ample physical meanings and extend the
category of CA. Firstly, the weights are increased to connect the updated cell
and its neighbours, and the output of each cell depends on the states of cells
in the neighbourhood and their respective weights. Secondly, the error
correction algorithm is adopted to find correct transition rules by adjusting
weights. When the error is zero, the required transition rules with correct
weights will be found to describe the fixed configuration. The CAW with the
correct rules will relax to the fixed configuration regardless of the initial
states. Finally, the mathematical analysis and simulation are carried out with
one-dimensional CAW, and the results show that the proposed algorithm has the
ability to find correct transition rules as the error converges exponentially.

descriptor (STD) for 3D place recognition. For a triangle, its shape is
uniquely determined by the length of the sides or included angles. Moreover,
the shape of triangles is completely invariant to rigid transformations. Based
on this property, we first design an algorithm to efficiently extract local key
points from the 3D point cloud and encode these key points into triangular
descriptors. Then, place recognition is achieved by matching the side lengths
(and some other information) of the descriptors between point clouds. The point
correspondence obtained from the descriptor matching pair can be further used
in geometric verification, which greatly improves the accuracy of place
recognition. In our experiments, we extensively compare our proposed system

  Detection","13 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Unsupervised anomaly detection is a challenging task in industrial
applications since it is impracticable to collect sufficient anomalous samples.
In this paper, a novel Self-Supervised Guided Segmentation Framework (SGSF) is
proposed by jointly exploring effective generation method of forged anomalous
samples and the normal sample features as the guidance information of
segmentation for anomaly detection. Specifically, to ensure that the generated
forged anomaly samples are conducive to model training, the Saliency
Augmentation Module (SAM) is proposed. SAM introduces a saliency map to
generate saliency Perlin noise map, and develops an adaptive segmentation
strategy to generate irregular masks in the saliency region. Then, the masks
are utilized to generate forged anomalous samples as negative samples for
training. Unfortunately, the distribution gap between forged and real anomaly
samples makes it difficult for models trained based on forged samples to
effectively locate real anomalies. Towards this end, the Self-supervised
Guidance Network (SGN) is proposed. It leverages the self-supervised module to
extract features that are noise-free and contain normal semantic information as
the prior knowledge of the segmentation module. The segmentation module with
the knowledge of normal patterns segments out the abnormal regions that are
different from the guidance features. To evaluate the effectiveness of SGSF for
anomaly detection, extensive experiments are conducted on three anomaly
detection datasets. The experimental results show that SGSF achieves
state-of-the-art anomaly detection results.

unsupervised visual anomaly detection method to jointly learn effective normal

detailed features with semantic integrity of normal samples. It develops a new
partition mechanism and a unique query generation method to preserve the

make the reconstruction of abnormal samples worse. To obtain more precise
anomaly localization results and solve the problem of cumulative reconstruction
error, a novel Histogram Error Estimation module is proposed to adaptively
eliminate the unfavorable errors by the histogram of the difference image. It
improves the anomaly localization performance without increasing the cost. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method for anomaly detection and

in loops. Automatically proving safety properties of such programs that
manipulate arrays is challenging. We present a novel verification technique,
called full-program induction, for proving (a sub-class of) quantified as well
as quantifier-free properties of programs manipulating arrays of parametric
size $N$. Instead of inducting over individual loops, our technique inducts
over the entire program (possibly containing multiple loops) directly via the
program parameter $N$. The technique performs non-trivial transformations of
the given program and pre-conditions during the inductive step. The
transformations assist in effectively reducing the assertion checking problem
by transforming a program with multiple loops to a program which has fewer and
simpler loops or is loop-free. Significantly, full-program induction does not
require generation or use of loop-specific invariants. To assess the efficacy
of our technique, we have developed a prototype tool called Vajra. We
demonstrate the performance of Vajra vis-a-vis several state-of-the-art tools
on a large set of array manipulating benchmarks from the international software
verification competition (SV-COMP) and on several programs inspired by
algebraic functions that perform polynomial computations.

The detection scheme uses linear matrix inequalities as constraints with

faults and robustness against disturbances or parametric uncertainties. We
explore a nonlinear inverter model formulation based on the less-restrictive
one-sided Lipschitz and quadratic inner-boundedness conditions instead of the
state-of-the-art formulation based on the Lipschitz condition. In this sense,
we aim to overcome the sensitivity of observer-based schemes to the Lipschitz
constant. The relation between these two formulations for fault detection is
analyzed theoretically. We find the deterministic matrix expressions of
different internal faults, including busbar, actuator, and inverter bridge
faults. The performance of the proposed detection method is tested on an
islanded AC microgrid with four grid-forming inverters and compared against the
state-of-the-art nonlinear detection based on the Lipschitz condition. Most
importantly, this method requires no additional sensors, a crucial advantage
over many proposed solutions in the literature.

the classical notion of Clarke stationarity is computationally intractable up
to some sufficiently small constant tolerance, the randomized first-order
algorithms find a $(\delta, \epsilon)$-Goldstein stationary point with the
complexity bound of $\tilde{O}(\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$, which is independent
of dimension $d \geq 1$~\citep{Zhang-2020-Complexity, Davis-2022-Gradient,
Tian-2022-Finite}. However, the deterministic algorithms have not been fully
explored, leaving open several problems in nonsmooth nonconvex optimization.
Our first contribution is to demonstrate that the randomization is
\textit{necessary} to obtain a dimension-independent guarantee, by proving a
lower bound of $\Omega(d)$ for any deterministic algorithm that has access to
both $1^{st}$ and $0^{th}$ oracles. Furthermore, we show that the $0^{th}$
oracle is \textit{essential} to obtain a finite-time convergence guarantee, by
showing that any deterministic algorithm with only the $1^{st}$ oracle is not
able to find an approximate Goldstein stationary point within a finite number
of iterations up to sufficiently small constant parameter and tolerance.
Finally, we propose a deterministic smoothing approach under the
\textit{arithmetic circuit} model where the resulting smoothness parameter is
exponential in a certain parameter $M > 0$ (e.g., the number of nodes in the
representation of the function), and design a new deterministic first-order
algorithm that achieves a dimension-independent complexity bound of

fields are ready for ground state catalyst discovery. Our key finding is that
relaxation using forces from a learned potential yields structures with similar
or lower energy to those relaxed using the RPBE functional in over 50\% of
evaluated systems, despite the fact that the predicted forces differ
significantly from the ground truth. This has the surprising implication that
learned potentials may be ready for replacing DFT in challenging catalytic
systems such as those found in the Open Catalyst 2020 dataset. Furthermore, we
show that a force field trained on a locally harmonic energy surface with the
same minima as a target DFT energy is also able to find lower or similar energy
structures in over 50\% of cases. This ``Easy Potential'' converges in fewer
steps than a standard model trained on true energies and forces, which further
accelerates calculations. Its success illustrates a key point: learned
potentials can locate energy minima even when the model has high force errors.
The main requirement for structure optimisation is simply that the learned
potential has the correct minima. Since learned potentials are fast and scale
linearly with system size, our results open the possibility of quickly finding
ground states for large systems.

Quantification of retinal fluids is necessary for OCT-guided treatment
management, which relies on a precise image segmentation step. As manual
analysis of retinal fluids is a time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone
task, there is increasing demand for fast and robust automatic solutions. In
this study, a new convolutional neural architecture named RetiFluidNet is
proposed for multi-class retinal fluid segmentation. The model benefits from
hierarchical representation learning of textural, contextual, and edge features
using a new self-adaptive dual-attention (SDA) module, multiple self-adaptive
attention-based skip connections (SASC), and a novel multi-scale deep self
supervision learning (DSL) scheme. The attention mechanism in the proposed SDA
module enables the model to automatically extract deformation-aware
representations at different levels, and the introduced SASC paths further
consider spatial-channel interdependencies for concatenation of counterpart
encoder and decoder units, which improve representational capability.
RetiFluidNet is also optimized using a joint loss function comprising a
weighted version of dice overlap and edge-preserved connectivity-based losses,
where several hierarchical stages of multi-scale local losses are integrated
into the optimization process. The model is validated based on three publicly
available datasets: RETOUCH, OPTIMA, and DUKE, with comparisons against several
baselines. Experimental results on the datasets prove the effectiveness of the
proposed model in retinal OCT fluid segmentation and reveal that the suggested
method is more effective than existing state-of-the-art fluid segmentation
algorithms in adapting to retinal OCT scans recorded by various image scanning

for real raw videos. Considering the superiority of raw image SR over sRGB
image SR, we construct a real-world raw video SR (Real-RawVSR) dataset and
propose a corresponding SR method. We utilize two DSLR cameras and a
beam-splitter to simultaneously capture low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution
(HR) raw videos with 2x, 3x, and 4x magnifications. There are 450 video pairs
in our dataset, with scenes varying from indoor to outdoor, and motions
including camera and object movements. To our knowledge, this is the first
real-world raw VSR dataset. Since the raw video is characterized by the Bayer
pattern, we propose a two-branch network, which deals with both the packed RGGB
sequence and the original Bayer pattern sequence, and the two branches are
complementary to each other. After going through the proposed co-alignment,
interaction, fusion, and reconstruction modules, we generate the corresponding
HR sRGB sequence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms benchmark real and synthetic video SR methods with either raw or

further research on the CPV problem in the standard model (SM) with thirty-two
candidate sets of the ten ""natural"" parameters that exhibit the same CKM
performance. These parameters are considered ""natural"" because they consist
solely of the Yukawa couplings and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the
unique Higgs doublet in the SM. We then investigate the CPV problem and the BAU
problem using the Jarlskog measure of CPV, $\Delta_{CP}=J(m^2_t -m^2_c)(m^2_t
-m^2_u)(m^2_c -m^2_u)(m^2_b -m^2_s)(m^2_b -m^2_d)(m^2_s -m^2_d)/ T^{12}$, given
that CP symmetry is violated following the breakdowns of $S_N$ symmetries.
Subsequently, we perform numerical tests in a simplified scenario where eight
of the ten parameters are fixed, and the remaining two parameters are allowed
to vary from their $S_2$-symmetric values ${\bf (x,~y)}=(-1,~1)$ to their
current values in all thirty-two parameter sets. To estimate the enhancement of
CPV in such processes, we propose a ratio $R_{\Delta} \equiv \Delta_{CP} /

denoted by $\Delta^{(0)}_{CP}$, which is approximately $10^{-20}$. In all
thirty-two cases, the three-dimensional (3D) plots of $R_{\Delta}$ exhibit many
regions that stick out of the $R_{\Delta}=10^{10}$ plane, especially in regions
very close to ${\bf (x,~y)}=(-1,~1)$. These results demonstrate that the
$S_N$-breaking Standard Model is already sufficient to violate CP symmetry

both the content and emotion views, and then generate the empathetic response
based on the disentangled representations, thereby both the content and emotion

universities and the influence of transformative agreements is measured by
combining several data sources (incl. Web of Science, Unpaywall, an authority
file of standardised German affiliation information, the ISSN-Gold-OA 4.0 list,
and lists of publications covered by transformative agreements). For managerial
self-governance, a structured data collection was created by harvesting
different sources of information and by manual online search. To determine the
explanatory power of the different factors, a series of regression analyses was
performed for different periods and for both Full as well as Hybrid OA. As a
result of the regression analyses, the most determining factor for the
explanation of differences in the uptake of both OA-types turned out to be
academic self-governance. For the year 2020, Hybrid OA transformative
agreements have become a second relevant factor. However, all variables that
reflect local infrastructural support and services for OA (managerial
self-governance) turned out to be non-significant. To deepen the understanding
of the adoption of OA on the level of institutions, the outcomes of the

are found to depend on the lattice parameters of the original layer. The
absence of the ${\alpha}$-U (001) orientation in the transition products
suggests that the transitions in these layers are mediated by mechanisms other
than the [110] transverse acoustic phonon mode previously suggested for the
cubic ${\gamma}$-U(110) to hcp-U(00.1) to ${\alpha}$-U(001) displacive phase

  and Computation (ISAAC 2022). Added the references due to Al-Thani and Lee",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the Determinant Maximization problem, given an $n\times n$ positive
semi-definite matrix $\bf{A}$ in $\mathbb{Q}^{n\times n}$ and an integer $k$,
we are required to find a $k\times k$ principal submatrix of $\bf{A}$ having
the maximum determinant. This problem is known to be NP-hard and further proven
to be W[1]-hard with respect to $k$ by Koutis. However, there is still room to
explore its parameterized complexity in the restricted case, in the hope of
overcoming the general-case parameterized intractability. In this study, we
rule out the fixed-parameter tractability of Determinant Maximization even if
an input matrix is extremely sparse or low rank, or an approximate solution is
acceptable. We first prove that Determinant Maximization is NP-hard and
W[1]-hard even if an input matrix is an arrowhead matrix; i.e., the underlying
graph formed by nonzero entries is a star, implying that the structural
sparsity is not helpful. By contrast, Determinant Maximization is known to be
solvable in polynomial time on tridiagonal matrices. Thereafter, we demonstrate
the W[1]-hardness with respect to the rank $r$ of an input matrix. Our result
is stronger than Koutis' result in the sense that any $k\times k$ principal
submatrix is singular whenever $k>r$. We finally give evidence that it is
W[1]-hard to approximate Determinant Maximization parameterized by $k$ within a
factor of $2^{-c\sqrt{k}}$ for some universal constant $c>0$. Our hardness
result is conditional on the Parameterized Inapproximability Hypothesis posed
by Lokshtanov, Ramanujan, Saurab, and Zehavi, which asserts that a gap version
of Binary Constraint Satisfaction Problem is W[1]-hard. To complement this
result, we develop an $\epsilon$-additive approximation algorithm that runs in
$\epsilon^{-r^2}\cdot r^{O(r^3)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time for the rank $r$ of an
input matrix, provided that the diagonal entries are bounded.

useful information about the graphs to which they are associated, but complete
invariants can be used to distinguish between non-isomorphic graphs. Polynomial
invariants for graphs such as the well-known Tutte polynomial have been studied
for several years, and recently there has been interest to also define such
invariants for phylogenetic networks, a special type of graph that arises in
the area of evolutionary biology. Recently Liu gave a complete invariant for
(phylogenetic) trees. However, the polynomial invariants defined thus far for
phylogenetic networks that are not trees require vertex labels and either
contain a large number of variables, or they have exponentially many terms in
the number of reticulations. This can make it difficult to compute these
polynomials and to use them to analyse unlabelled networks. In this paper, we
shall show how to circumvent some of these difficulties for rooted cactuses and
cactuses. As well as being important in other areas such as operations
research, rooted cactuses contain some common classes of phylogenetic networks
such phylogenetic trees and level-1 networks. More specifically, we define a
polynomial $F$ that is a complete invariant for the class of rooted cactuses
without vertices of indegree 1 and outdegree 1 that has 5 variables, and a
polynomial $Q$ that is a complete invariant for the class of rooted cactuses
that has 6 variables \vince{whose degree can be bounded linearly in terms of
the size of the rooted cactus}. We also explain how to extend the $Q$
polynomial to define a complete invariant for leaf-labelled rooted cactuses as

  ALOHA-Driven Backscatter Communications",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In conventional backscatter communication (BackCom) systems, time division
multiple access (TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA) are
generally adopted for multiuser backscattering due to their simplicity in
implementation. However, as the number of backscatter devices (BDs)
proliferates, there will be a high overhead under the traditional centralized
control techniques, and the inter-user coordination is unaffordable for the
passive BDs, which are of scarce concern in existing works and remain unsolved.
To this end, in this paper, we propose a slotted ALOHA-based random access for
BackCom systems, in which each BD is randomly chosen and is allowed to coexist
with one active device for hybrid multiple access. To excavate and evaluate the
performance, a resource allocation problem for max-min transmission rate is
formulated, where transmit antenna selection, receive beamforming design,
reflection coefficient adjustment, power control, and access probability
determination are jointly considered. To deal with this intractable problem, we
first transform the objective function with the max-min form into an equivalent
linear one, and then decompose the resulting problem into three sub-problems.
Next, a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based greedy algorithm with a penalty
function, successive convex approximation, and linear programming are designed
to obtain sub-optimal solutions for tractable analysis. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark algorithms in
terms of transmission rate and fairness.

train a shared model over decentralized data. To address privacy concerns, FL
systems need to safeguard the clients' data from disclosure during training and
control data leakage through trained models when exposed to untrusted domains.
Distributed differential privacy (DP) offers an appealing solution in this
regard as it achieves a balanced tradeoff between privacy and utility without a
trusted server. However, existing distributed DP mechanisms are impractical in
the presence of client dropout, resulting in poor privacy guarantees or
degraded training accuracy. In addition, these mechanisms suffer from severe
efficiency issues.
  We present Hyades, a distributed differentially private FL framework that is
highly efficient and resilient to client dropout. Specifically, we develop a
novel 'add-then-remove' scheme that enforces a required noise level precisely
in each training round, even if some sampled clients drop out. This ensures
that the privacy budget is utilized prudently, despite unpredictable client
dynamics. To boost performance, Hyades operates as a distributed parallel
architecture via encapsulating the communication and computation operations
into stages. It automatically divides the global model aggregation into several
chunk-aggregation tasks and pipelines them for optimal speedup. Large-scale
deployment evaluations demonstrate that Hyades efficiently handles client
dropout in various realistic FL scenarios, achieving the optimal
privacy-utility tradeoff and accelerating training by up to 2.4$\times$
compared to existing solutions.

in non-Hermitian systems during the past few years. In this work, we discuss
the energy dependence of NHSE by introducing nonreciprocity beyond the
nearest-neighboring hopping in the one-dimensional lattices. The direction of
NHSE reverses as the eigenenergy of the system under open boundary conditions
(OBCs) sweeps across some critical energies. To characterize such a phenomenon,
we introduce the concept of non-Hermitian skin effect edges, which separate the
eigenstates localized at opposite ends of the lattice in the OBC spectrum. We
find the skin effect edges are determined by the self-intersections in the
spectrum under periodic boundary conditions (PBCs), which are topological as
the winding number of the PBC spectrum changes sign when crossing them.
Moreover, the NHSE edges will disappear when the self-intersections merge into
a single point by tuning the system parameters. Our work reveals the intricate
interplay between NHSE and nonreciprocal hopping in non-Hermitian systems.

the description of graphene and some other materials with external potential.

natural extension of the Fomin-Zelevinsky cluster complex coming from finite
type cluster algebras. In this work, to each face of this complex we associate
a parabolic conjugacy class of the underlying finite Coxeter group. We show
that the refined enumeration of faces (respectively, positive faces) according
to this data gives an explicit formula in terms of the corresponding
characteristic polynomial (equivalently, in terms of Orlik-Solomon exponents).
This characteristic polynomial originally comes from the theory of hyperplane
arrangements, but it is conveniently defined via the parabolic Burnside ring.
This makes a connection with the theory of parking spaces: our results
eventually rely on some enumeration of chains of noncrossing partitions that
were obtained in this context. As consequences of our enumeration of faces, we
completely explain some observations by Fomin and Reading about f -vectors, we
obtain identities that essentially refine the transformation between f -vectors
and h-vectors, and introduce new kinds of parking spaces that we call cluster
parking spaces.

based on their variable-length historical vision records.
  Methods: From October 2019 to March 2022, we examined binocular uncorrected
visual acuity, axial length, corneal curvature, and axial of 75,172 eyes from
37,586 adolescents aged 6-20 years in Chengdu, China. 80\% samples consist of
the training set and the remaining 20\% form the testing set. Time-Aware Long
Short-Term Memory was used to quantitatively predict the adolescents' spherical
equivalent within two and a half years.
  Result: The mean absolute prediction error on the testing set was 0.273-0.257
for spherical equivalent, ranging from 0.189-0.160 to 0.596-0.473 if we
consider different lengths of historical records and different prediction

with the characteristics of real data and thus has higher applicability, and
helps to identify the progression of myopia earlier. The overall error 0.273 is

algorithm does not guarantee the generalization performance of the trained TTS
model in synthesizing voices of unseen speakers who are not included in the
training data. Our algorithm alternatively trains two deep neural networks:
multi-task discriminator and multi-speaker neural TTS model (i.e., generator of
GANs). The discriminator is trained not only to distinguish between natural and
synthetic speech but also to verify the speaker of input speech is existent or
non-existent (i.e., newly generated by interpolating seen speakers' embedding
vectors). Meanwhile, the generator is trained to minimize the weighted sum of
the speech reconstruction loss and adversarial loss for fooling the
discriminator, which achieves high-quality multi-speaker TTS even if the target
speaker is unseen. Experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm improves
the quality of synthetic speech better than a conventional GANSpeech algorithm.

Europe, this transition has been led by wind energy, which is one of the
fastest growing energy sources. However, energy demand and production are
sensitive to meteorological conditions and atmospheric variability at multiple
time scales. To accomplish the required balance between these two variables,
critical conditions of high demand and low wind energy supply must be
considered in the design of energy systems. We describe a methodology for
modeling joint distributions of meteorological variables without making any
assumptions about their marginal distributions. In this context, Gaussian
copulas are used to model the correlated nature of cold and weak-wind events.
The marginal distributions are modeled with logistic regressions defining two
sets of binary variables as predictors: four large-scale weather regimes and
the months of the extended winter season. By applying this framework to ERA5
data, we can compute the joint probabilities of co-occurrence of cold and
weak-wind events on a high-resolution grid (0.25 deg). Our results show that a)
weather regimes must be considered when modeling cold and weak-wind events, b)

commissioning to identify and analyse potentially hazardous system states that
may arise during operation. Currently, hazard analysis is mainly based on human
reasoning, past experiences, and simple tools such as checklists and
spreadsheets. Increasing system complexity makes such approaches decreasingly
suitable. Furthermore, testing-based hazard analysis is often not suitable due
to high costs or dangers of physical faults. A remedy for this are model-based
hazard analysis methods, which either rely on formal models or on simulation
models, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. This paper proposes a
two-layer approach that combines the benefits of exhaustive analysis using
formal methods with detailed analysis using simulation. Unsafe behaviours that
lead to unsafe states are first synthesised from a formal model of the system
using Supervisory Control Theory. The result is then input to the simulation
where detailed analyses using domain-specific risk metrics are performed.
Though the presented approach is generally applicable, this paper demonstrates
the benefits of the approach on an industrial human-robot collaboration system.

generated trajectories are updated by Kernelized Movement Primitives, which are
based on human catching demonstrations to ensure a smooth transition around the

to the robot's Cartesian impedance controller to absorb the post-impact forces

$\mathcal{O}(NM^3)$, where $N$ and $M$ are the number of time instants and

show that by exploring the Kronecker structure of the state-space model

reduce the computational complexity to $\mathcal{O}(M^3+NM^2)$ and thus the

large $M$. The proposed implementation is illustrated over applications in
weather data prediction and spatially-distributed system identification. Our

process efficiency, with the long-term goal of full automation. This implies
automatic resolutions of emotionally charged scheduling conflicts. In the

set theory and of Peano arithmetic PA has a pointwise-definable end extension.
In the arithmetic case, I use the universal algorithm and its $\Sigma_n$
generalizations to build a progressively elementary tower making any desired
individual $a_n$ definable at each stage $n$, while preserving these
definitions through to the limit model, which can thus be arranged to be
pointwise definable. A similar method works in set theory, and one can moreover
achieve $V=L$ in the extension or indeed any other suitable theory holding in
an inner model of the original model, thereby fulfilling the resurrection
phenomenon. For example, every countable model of ZF with an inner model with a

be done between time and accuracy. Indeed, R-HANLS is fast and accurate for
large problems, while R-ANLS is more accurate, but also more resources
demanding, both in time and memory. R-NLS is very accurate but only for small

information-theoretic methods have been developed and are being continually
refined in the earth sciences. Here we show that transfer entropy-based causal
graphs, which have recently become popular in the earth sciences with

  Averaging for Better Generalization",,,,,"stat.ML cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Tail Averaging improves on Polyak averaging's non-asymptotic behaviour by
excluding a number of leading iterates of stochastic optimization from its
calculations. In practice, with a finite number of optimization steps and a
learning rate that cannot be annealed to zero, Tail Averaging can get much
closer to a local minimum point of the training loss than either the individual
iterates or the Polyak average. However, the number of leading iterates to
ignore is an important hyperparameter, and starting averaging too early or too
late leads to inefficient use of resources or suboptimal solutions. Our work
focusses on improving generalization, which makes setting this hyperparameter
even more difficult, especially in the presence of other hyperparameters and
overfitting. Furthermore, before averaging starts, the loss is only weakly
informative of the final performance, which makes early stopping unreliable. To
alleviate these problems, we propose an anytime variant of Tail Averaging
intended for improving generalization not pure optimization, that has no
hyperparameters and approximates the optimal tail at all optimization steps.
Our algorithm is based on two running averages with adaptive lengths bounded in
terms of the optimal tail length, one of which achieves approximate optimality
with some regularity. Requiring only the additional storage for two sets of
weights and periodic evaluation of the loss, the proposed Two-Tailed Averaging
algorithm is a practical and widely applicable method for improving
generalization.

the case by computing cosmological constraints. While our analysis tends to

for a non-vanishing momentum transfer in the dark sector. Since upcoming galaxy
surveys will deliver information on scales and red-shift relevant for testing
models allowing momentum transfer in the dark sector, we also carried out
forecasts using different survey configurations. We assessed the relevance of
neglecting lensing convergence $\kappa$ when modelling the angular power

$L_q$, which recover the Kerr spacetime in the absence of quantum effects ($L_q

increases monotonically, while the shape gets more distorted, allowing us to
constrain the fundamental parameter $L_q$. We use the astrophysical observables
shadow area $A$ and oblateness $D$ to estimate the BH parameters. It may be
useful in extracting additional information about LIRBHs. While the EHT
observational results completely rule out the wormhole region in the LIRBH-2, a

encapsulates important clues on the interplay between supermassive black hole
(SMBH) and galaxy growth. This paper presents the demography, mean power and
cosmic evolution of radio AGN across star-forming galaxies (SFGs) of different
stellar masses (${M_{*}}$). We exploit deep VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz data to build the
rest-frame 1.4 GHz AGN luminosity functions at 0.1$\leq$$z$$\leq$4.5 hosted in
SFGs. Splitting the AGN luminosity function into different ${M_{*}}$ bins
reveals that, at all redshifts, radio AGN are both more frequent and more
luminous in higher ${M_*}$ than in lower ${M_*}$ galaxies. The cumulative
kinetic luminosity density exerted by radio AGN in SFGs peaks at $z$$\sim$2,
and it is mostly driven by galaxies with
10.5$\leq$$\log$(${M_{*}}$/${M_{\odot}}$)$<$11. Averaging the cumulative radio
AGN activity across all SFGs at each (${M_{*}}$,$z$) results in a ""radio-AGN
main sequence"" that links the time-averaged radio-AGN power
$\langle$$L_{1.4}^{{AGN}}$$\rangle$ and galaxy stellar mass, in the form:
$\log$$\langle$[$L_{1.4}^{{AGN}}$/ W Hz$^{-1}]\rangle$ = (20.97$\pm$0.16) +
(2.51$\pm$0.34)$\cdot$$\log$(1+$z$) +
(1.41$\pm$0.09)$\cdot$($\log$[${M_{*}}$/${M_{\odot}}$] -10). The super-linear
dependence on ${M_{*}}$, at fixed redshift, suggests enhanced radio-AGN
activity in more massive SFGs, as compared to star formation. We ascribe this
enhancement to both a higher radio AGN duty cycle and a brighter radio-AGN
phase in more massive SFGs. A remarkably consistent ${M_{*}}$ dependence is
seen for the evolving X-ray AGN population in SFGs. This similarity is
interpreted as possibly driven by secular cold gas accretion fueling both radio
and X-ray AGN activity in a similar fashion over the galaxy's lifetime.

performance is prone to both channel estimation errors and potential
eavesdropping. Hence, we investigate the effective secrecy throughput of the
UAV-aided uplink, in which rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is employed by
each legitimate user for secure transmission under the scenario of massive
access. To maximize the effective network secrecy throughput in the uplink, the
transmission rate vs. power allocation relationship is formulated as a max-min
optimization problem, relying on realistic imperfect CSI of both the legitimate
users and of the potential eavesdroppers (Eves). We then propose a novel
transformation of the associated probabilistic constraints for decoupling the
variables, so that our design problem can be solved by alternatively activating
the related block coordinate decent programming. In the model considered, each
user transmits a superposition of two messages to a UAV-BS, each having
different transmit power and the UAV-BS uses a SIC technique to decode the
received messages. Given the non-convexity of the problem, it is decoupled into
a pair of sub-problems. In particular, we derive a closed form expression for
the optimal rate-splitting fraction of each user. Then, given the optimal
rate-splitting fraction of each user, the \epsilon-constrainted transmit power
of each user is calculated by harnessing SPCA programming.

to detect the correct rotation period. Recently, Shapiro et al. (2020) showed
that the periods of such stars could still be measured by considering the
Gradient of the Power Spectrum (GPS) instead of the power spectrum itself. In
this study, the GPS method is applied to model light curves of solar-like stars
covering all possible inclination angles and a large range of metallicities and
observational noise levels. The model parameters are chosen such that they
resemble those of many stars in the Kepler field. We show that the GPS method
is able to detect the correct rotation period in 40% of all considered cases,
which is more than ten times higher than the detection rate of standard
techniques. Thus, we conclude that the GPS method is ideally suited to measure
periods of those Kepler stars lacking such a measurement so far. We also show
that the GPS method is significantly superior to auto-correlation methods when
starspot lifetimes are shorter than a few rotation periods. GPS begins to yield
rotation periods that are too short when dominant spot lifetimes are shorter
than one rotation period. We conclude that new methods are generally needed to
reliably detect rotation periods from sufficiently aperiodic time series --
these periods will otherwise remain undetected.

retrieval into three sub-problems and building one simple yet efficiency model
for each sub-problem. Specifically, the first model is constructed for
obtaining modality-invariant features by complementing semi-paired data based
on manifold learning, whereas the second model and the third model aim to learn
hash codes and hash functions respectively. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our DMH compared with the
state-of-the-art fully-paired and semi-paired unsupervised cross-modal hashing
methods.

in the last 10 years. Most of the pretrained speaker embeddings are trained on
English corpora, because it is easily accessible. Thus, language dependency can
be an important factor in automatic forensic voice comparison, especially when
the target language is linguistically very different. There are numerous
commercial systems available, but their models are mainly trained on a
different language (mostly English) than the target language. In the case of a
low-resource language, developing a corpus for forensic purposes containing
enough speakers to train deep learning models is costly. This study aims to
investigate whether a model pre-trained on English corpus can be used on a
target low-resource language (here, Hungarian), different from the model is
trained on. Also, often multiple samples are not available from the offender
(unknown speaker). Therefore, samples are compared pairwise with and without
speaker enrollment for suspect (known) speakers. Two corpora are applied that
were developed especially for forensic purposes, and a third that is meant for
traditional speaker verification. Two deep learning based speaker embedding
vector extraction methods are used: the x-vector and ECAPA-TDNN. Speaker
verification was evaluated in the likelihood-ratio framework. A comparison is
made between the language combinations (modeling, LR calibration, evaluation).
The results were evaluated by minCllr and EER metrics. It was found that the
model pre-trained on a different language but on a corpus with a huge amount of
speakers performs well on samples with language mismatch. The effect of sample
durations and speaking styles were also examined. It was found that the longer
the duration of the sample in question the better the performance is. Also,
there is no real difference if various speaking styles are applied.

proposes a novel method by first ranking samples within each cluster based on
the confidence in their belonging to the current cluster and then using the
ranking to formulate a weighted cross-entropy loss to train the model. For
ranking the samples, we developed a method for computing the likelihood of

strategy for weighting the ranked samples. We present extensive experimental

a structure. However, numerous fundamental and practical restrictions have been
found and led to the formulation of Chu-Harrington, Geyi, and other limits,
which provide an upper bound to scattering efficiencies. Here we introduce a 2D
array of near-field coupled split-ring resonators and optimize its scattering
performances with the aid of a genetic algorithm, operating in 19th-dimensional
space. Experimental realization of the device is demonstrated to surpass the
theoretical single-channel limit by a factor of >2, motivating the development
of tighter bounds of scattering performances. A super-radiant criterion is
suggested to compare maximal scattering cross-sections versus the
single-channel dipolar limit multiplied by the number of elements within the
array. This new empirical criterion, which aims on addressing performances of
subwavelength arrays formed by near-field coupled elements, was found to be
rather accurate in application to the superscatterer, reported here.
Furthermore, the super-radiant bound was empirically verified with a
Monte-Carlo simulation, collecting statistics on scattering cross sections of a
large set of randomly distributed dipoles. The demonstrated flat superscatterer
can find use as a passive electromagnetic beacon, making miniature airborne and

anomalies. These might include bad data caused by gross measurement errors or
communication system failures. Sudden changes in load or generation can be
considered as anomaly depending on the implemented state estimation method.
Additionally, considering power grid as a cyber physical system, state
estimation becomes vulnerable to false data injection attacks. The existing
methods for anomaly classification cannot accurately classify (discriminate
between) the above mentioned three types of anomalies, especially when it comes
to discrimination between sudden load changes and false data injection attacks.
This paper presents a new algorithm for detecting anomaly presence, classifying
the anomaly type and identifying the origin of the anomaly, i.e., measurements
that contain gross errors in case of bad data, or buses associated with loads
experiencing a sudden change, or state variables targeted by false data
injection attack. The algorithm combines analytical and machine learning (ML)
approaches. The first stage exploits an analytical approach to detect anomaly
presence by combining $\chi^2$-test and anomaly detection index. The second
stage utilizes ML for classification of anomaly type and identification of its
origin, with particular reference to discrimination between sudden load changes
and false data injection attacks. The proposed ML based method is trained to be
independent of the network configuration which eliminates retraining of the
algorithm after network topology changes. The results obtained by implementing
the proposed algorithm on IEEE 14 bus test system demonstrate the accuracy and
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

manifestly-symmetric, local, lattice regularization in the same spacetime
dimensionality only if (i) the symmetry action is offsite, or (ii) if the
continuum anomaly is reproduced exactly on the lattice. We consider lattice
regularizations of a class of prototype models of QCD: the (1+1)-dimensional
asymptotically-free Grassmannian nonlinear sigma models (NLSMs) with a $\theta$
term. Using the Grassmannian NLSMs as a case study, we provide examples of
lattice regularizations in which both possibilities are realized. For
possibility (i), we argue that Grassmannian NLSMs can be obtained from
$\mathrm{SU}(N)$ antiferromagnets with a well-defined continuum limit,
reproducing both the infrared physics of $\theta$ vacua and the ultraviolet
physics of asymptotic freedom. These results enable the application of new
classical algorithms to lattice Monte Carlo studies of these quantum field
theories, and provide a viable realization suited for their quantum simulation.
On the other hand, we show that, perhaps surprisingly, the conventional lattice
regularization of $\theta$ vacua due to Berg and L\""uscher reproduces the
anomaly exactly on the lattice, providing a realization of the second
possibility.

worldwide. However, research grade EEG (32/64ch) systems are expensive and have
cumbersome setup designed for clinical usage not suited for rugged environment
of field-studies outside lab. Further, the long setup-time of EEG can be
intimidating to those who are restless subjects e.g., children or elderly.
Off-the-shelf, low-cost, dry EEG devices (LCDE) have been proposed as promising
options. However, small number of electrodes in LCDE limit the detection
scalp-area reducing the utility of an LCDE only to a specific set of cognitive
tasks based on the brain lobe scanned. This paper proposes a novel methodology
for calibration of an LCDE (e.g., DREEM Headband) to identify the specific
class of cognitive tasks a LCDE is likely suited for. The methodology involves
comparative analysis of the recorded data using LCDE with EEG-like signals
simulated (using BESA Simulator software) by embedding dipole in a brain lobe.
The simulated scalp activity and corresponding source analysis helps identify
the approximate regions of brain scanned by the LCDE device. On further
comparative analysis of brain lobes source localized using Brain Electrical
Source Analysis (BESA software) helps characterize LCDE for cognitive tasks.
The major findings conclude a list of psychological studies which can be
performed using various LCDE, capable of replacing traditional and expensive
wet EEG systems in both inside and outside-lab settings.

It would facilitate a better understanding of how differences and similarities

widely used to make decisions in choosing the loan portfolio of a bank. Banks

However, in most of the model formulation, limited liability is not taken into
consideration. Accordingly, to address this, we have, in this article, analyzed
the effect of including it in the model formulation. We formulate four models,
two of them are maximizing the expected return with risk constraint, including
and excluding limited-liability, and other two are minimization of risk with
threshold level of return with and without limited-liability. Our theoretical
results show that the solutions of the models with limited-liability produce
better results than the others, in both minimizing risk and maximizing expected

other model. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to support the

each column of $W$ are bounded, that is, they belong to given intervals, and
the columns of $H$ belong to the probability simplex, that is, $H$ is column
stochastic. BSSMF generalizes nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), and
simplex-structured matrix factorization (SSMF). BSSMF is particularly well
suited when the entries of the input matrix $X$ belong to a given interval; for
example when the rows of $X$ represent images, or $X$ is a rating matrix such
as in the Netflix and MovieLens datasets where the entries of $X$ belong to the
interval $[1,5]$. The simplex-structured matrix $H$ not only leads to an easily
understandable decomposition providing a soft clustering of the columns of $X$,
but implies that the entries of each column of $WH$ belong to the same
intervals as the columns of $W$. In this paper, we first propose a fast
algorithm for BSSMF, even in the presence of missing data in $X$. Then we
provide identifiability conditions for BSSMF, that is, we provide conditions
under which BSSMF admits a unique decomposition, up to trivial ambiguities.
Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of BSSMF on two applications:
extraction of features in a set of images, and the matrix completion problem

perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the rewards. Our method, depending
on the number of sigma points employed, can propagate either mean and
covariance with minimal points, or higher-order moments with more points
similarly to Monte Carlo. The whole framework is implemented as a computational
graph for online training. Furthermore, in order to prevent explosion in the
number of sigma points when propagating through a generic state-dependent
uncertainty model, we add sigma-point expansion and contraction layers to our
graph, which are designed using the principle of moment matching. Finally, we
propose gradient descent inspired by Sequential Quadratic Programming to update
policy parameters in the presence of state constraints. We demonstrate the
proposed method with two applications in simulation. The first one designs a
stabilizing controller for the cart-pole problem when the dynamics is known

mediated entanglement between two otherwise isolated optomechanical systems can
be significantly increased by modulating the optomechanical coupling. This is
most pronounced for low mass, high frequency systems - convenient for reaching
the quantum regime - and can lead to improvements of several orders of
magnitude, as well as a broadening of the measurement window. Nevertheless,
significant obstacles still remain. In particular, we find that modulations
increase decoherence effects at the same rate as the entanglement improvements.
This adds to the growing evidence that the constraint on noise (acting on the

of the environment and cannot be improved by novel quantum control. Finally, we
highlight the close connection between the observation of quantum correlations

support users' tasks. Recently, machine learning techniques have enabled the
transition to more powerful and complex adaptive UIs. However, a core challenge
for adaptive user interfaces is the reliance on high-quality user data that has
to be collected offline for each task. We formulate UI adaptation as a
multi-agent reinforcement learning problem to overcome this challenge. In our
formulation, a user agent mimics a real user and learns to interact with a UI.
Simultaneously, an interface agent learns UI adaptations to maximize the user
agent's performance. The interface agent learns the task structure from the
user agent's behavior and, based on that, can support the user agent in
completing its task. Our method produces adaptation policies that are learned
in simulation only and, therefore, does not need real user data. Our
experiments show that learned policies generalize to real users and achieve on
par performance with data-driven supervised learning baselines.

polarization experiments is the detection of primordial gravitational waves
through an unbiased measurement of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Robust
detection of this signal will require mitigating all possible contamination to
the $B$-mode polarization from astrophysical origins. One such extragalactic
contamination arises from the patchiness in the electron density during the
reionization epoch. Along with the signature on CMB polarization, the patchy
reionization can source secondary anisotropies on the CMB temperature through
the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect. In order to study the impact of
this foreground for the upcoming CMB missions, we present a self-consistent
framework to compute the CMB anisotropies based on a physically motivated model
of reionization. We show that the value of $r$ can bias towards a higher value
if the secondary contribution from reionization is neglected. However,
combining small-scale kSZ signal, large-scale $E$-mode polarization, and
$B$-mode polarization measurements, we can put constraints on the patchiness in
electron density during reionization and can mitigate its impact on the value
of $r$. CMB missions such as CMB-S4 and PICO may experience a bias of
$>0.17\sigma$ which can go as high as $\sim 0.73\sigma$ for extreme
reionization models allowed by the Planck and SPT CMB measurements. As future
experiments target to measure $r$ at $5\sigma$, this is likely to affect the
measurement significance and hence possibly affect the claim of detection of
$r$, if not mitigated properly by using joint estimations of different
reionization observables.

decomposition with actor-critic enables agents to learn stochastic policies,
which are more suitable for the partially observable environment. Given the
goal of learning local policies that enable decentralized execution, agents are
commonly assumed to be independent of each other, even in centralized training.
However, such an assumption may prohibit agents from learning the optimal joint
policy. To address this problem, we explicitly take the dependency among agents
into centralized training. Although this leads to the optimal joint policy, it
may not be factorized for decentralized execution. Nevertheless, we
theoretically show that from such a joint policy, we can always derive another
joint policy that achieves the same optimality but can be factorized for
decentralized execution. To this end, we propose multi-agent conditional policy
factorization (MACPF), which takes more centralized training but still enables
decentralized execution. We empirically verify MACPF in various cooperative
MARL tasks and demonstrate that MACPF achieves better performance or faster
convergence than baselines. Our code is available at

route toward magnetic and photonic materials for information processing due to
their defect-immune and low-driven energy. However, the practical application
of magnetic skyrmions is severely hindered by their harsh cryogenic environment
and complex carriers. In addition, the narrowband nature of magnetic and
photonic skyrmions leads to lower data rate transmissions, restricting the
development of high-speed information processing technologies. Here, we
introduce and demonstrate the concept of phononic skyrmion as new topological
structures to break the above barriers. The phononic skyrmion can be produced
in any solid structure at room temperature, including chip-scale structures,
with high robustness and ultra-bandwidth, which could pave a new path for
high-speed and topological information processing technologies. We
experimentally demonstrate the existence of phononic skyrmion formed by
breaking the rotational symmetry of the three-dimensional hybrid spin of
elastic waves. The frequency-independent spin configuration leads to the
remarkable ultra-broadband and tunable feature of phononic skyrmions. We
further experimentally show the excellent robustness of the flexibly movable
phononic skyrmion lattices against local defects of disorder, sharp corners,
and even rectangular holes. Our research also opens a vibrant horizon towards
an unprecedented way for elastic wave manipulation and structuration by spin
configuration, and offers a promising lever for alternative phononic
technologies, including quantum information, biomedical testing, and wave
engineering.

various kinds of compact binaries, such as compact main-sequence white-dwarf
binaries, and transients, such as double white-dwarf mergers and luminous red
novae. Despite its importance, only very few systematic studies of the
stability of mass transfer exist. Using the 1D stellar evolution code MESA, we
study the behaviour of mass-losing post-main-sequence donor stars with masses
between $1 M_{\odot}$ and $8 M_{\odot}$ in binaries, without assuming that the
donor star responds to mass loss adiabatically . We treat the accretor as a
point mass, which we do not evolve, and assume the mass transfer is
conservative. We find that the criterion that best predicts the onset of
runaway mass transfer is based on the transition to an effectively adiabatic
donor response to mass loss. We find that the critical mass ratio $q_{\rm qad}
\sim 0.25$ for stars crossing the Hertzsprung gap, while for convective giants
$q_{\rm qad}$ decreases from $\sim 1$ at the base of the RGB to $\sim 0.1$ at
the the onset of thermal pulses on the AGB. An effectively adiabatic response
of the donor star only occurs at a very high critical mass-transfer rate due to
the short local thermal timescale in the outermost layers of a red giant. For
$q > q_{\rm qad}$ mass transfer is self-regulated, but for evolved giants the
resulting mass-transfer rates can be so high that the evolution becomes
dynamical and/or the donor can overflow its outer lobe. Our results indicate
that mass transfer is stable for a wider range of binary parameter space than
typically assumed in rapid binary population synthesis and found in recent
similar studies. Moreover, we find a systematic dependence of the critical mass
ratio on the donor star mass and radius which may have significant consequences
for predictions of post-mass-transfer populations.

coordinated behavior can be learned. Some existing work communicates predicted
future trajectory with others, hoping to get clues about what others would do
for better coordination. However, circular dependencies sometimes can occur
when agents are treated synchronously so it is hard to coordinate
decision-making. In this paper, we propose a novel communication scheme,
Sequential Communication (SeqComm). SeqComm treats agents asynchronously (the
upper-level agents make decisions before the lower-level ones) and has two
communication phases. In negotiation phase, agents determine the priority of
decision-making by communicating hidden states of observations and comparing
the value of intention, which is obtained by modeling the environment dynamics.
In launching phase, the upper-level agents take the lead in making decisions
and communicate their actions with the lower-level agents. Theoretically, we
prove the policies learned by SeqComm are guaranteed to improve monotonically
and converge. Empirically, we show that SeqComm outperforms existing methods in
various multi-agent cooperative tasks.

denoising methods require a large-scale dataset or focus on supervised
settings, in which single/pairs of clean images or a set of noisy images are
required. This poses a significant burden on the image acquisition process.
Moreover, denoisers trained on datasets of limited scale may incur
over-fitting. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a new self-supervised
framework for image denoising based on the Tucker low-rank tensor
approximation. With the proposed design, we are able to characterize our
denoiser with fewer parameters and train it based on a single image, which
considerably improves the model generalizability and reduces the cost of data

and the equivalence of (SAC) and (SACC) for rings with positive depth, where
(SACC) is the symmetric Auslander condition for modules with constant rank. The
latter assertion affirmatively answers a question posed by Celikbas and

  Secondly, for a ring homomorphism $R \to S$, we prove that if $S$ satisfies
(SAC) (resp. (ARC)), then $R$ also satisfies (SAC) (resp. (ARC)) if the flat

BS estimates the complete target response matrix, and we consider three
different sensing performance metrics including the trace, the maximum
eigenvalue, and the determinant of the CRB matrix for target response matrix
estimation. For each of the four scenarios with different CRB measures, we
investigate the fundamental tradeoff between the CRB for estimation and the
data rate for communication, by characterizing the Pareto boundary of the
achievable CRB-rate (C-R) region. In particular, we formulate a new MIMO rate
maximization problem for each scenario, by optimizing the transmit covariance
matrix at the BS, subject to a different form of maximum CRB constraint and its
maximum transmit power constraint. For these problems, we obtain their optimal
solutions in semi-closed forms by using advanced convex optimization
techniques. For the point target case, the optimal solution is obtained by
diagonalizing a \emph{composite channel matrix} via singular value

these decomposed subchannels. For the three scenarios in the extended target

  Supervised Machine Learning Models","Submitted to IEEE Journal",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV cs.NE cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Performance comparison of supervised machine learning (ML) models are widely
done in terms of different confusion matrix based scores obtained on test
datasets. However, a dataset comprises several instances having different
difficulty levels. Therefore, it is more logical to compare effectiveness of ML
models on individual instances instead of comparing scores obtained for the
entire dataset. In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed for direct
comparison of supervised ML models in terms of individual instances within the
dataset. A direct comparison matrix called \emph{Prayatul Matrix} is
introduced, which accounts for comparative outcome of two ML algorithms on
different instances of a dataset. Five different performance measures are
designed based on prayatul matrix. Efficacy of the proposed approach as well as
designed measures is analyzed with four classification techniques on three
datasets. Also analyzed on four large-scale complex image datasets with four
deep learning models namely ResNet50V2, MobileNetV2, EfficientNet, and
XceptionNet. Results are evident that the newly designed measure are capable of
giving more insight about the comparing ML algorithms, which were impossible
with existing confusion matrix based scores like accuracy, precision and
recall.

noises, including low-frequency (1/f) noises, medium-frequency noises, and
high-frequency noises, are generated in Simulink by translating the Gaussian
white noise with different band-pass filters. While impulsive noise is studied
as an example of frequency-non stationary noises. Our simulated results
demonstrate that 1/f noises and impulsive noises have greater disturbance on
the AWVA measurements. In addition, adding one kind of frequency-stationary
noise, clamping the detected signals, and dominating the measurement range may
{have} the potential to improve the precision of the AWVA technique with both a
smaller deviation of the mean value and a smaller error bar in the presence of
many hostile non-Gaussian noises.

with degenerate dissipative or diffusive terms. This is the case for example in
gas dynamics, where the mass is conserved during the evolution, but the
momentum balance includes a diffusion (viscosity) or damping (relaxation) term,
or, in numerical simulations, of conservation laws by relaxation schemes. Such
so-called partially dissipative systems have been first pointed out by S.K.
Godunov in a short note in Russian in 1961. Much later, in 1984, S. Kawashima
highlighted in his PhD thesis a simple criterion ensuring the existence of
global strong solutions in the vicinity of a linearly stable constant state.
This criterion has been revisited in a number of research works. In particular,
K. Beauchard and E. Zuazua proposed in 2010 an explicit method for constructing
a Lyapunov functional allowing to refine Kawashima's results and to establish
global existence results in some situations that were not covered before. These
notes originate essentially from the PhD thesis of T. Crin-Barat that was
initially motivated by an earlier observation of the author in a Chapter of the
handbook coedited by Y. Giga and A. Novotn{\'y}. Our main aim is to adapt the
method of Beauchard and Zuazua to a class of symmetrizable quasilinear
hyperbolic systems (containing the compressible Euler equations), in a critical
regularity setting that allows to keep track of the dependence with respect to
e.g. the relaxation parameter. Compared to Beauchard and Zuazua's work, we
exhibit a 'damped mode' that will have a key role in the construction of global
solutions with critical regularity, in the proof of optimal time-decay
estimates and, last but not least, in the study of the strong relaxation limit.
For simplicity, we here focus on a simple class of partially dissipative

networks which a priori obey physical laws. We start with a simple single-layer
neural network (NN) but refrain from choosing the activation functions yet.
Under certain conditions and in the infinite-width limit, we may apply the
central limit theorem, upon which the NN output becomes Gaussian. We may then
investigate and manipulate the limit network by falling back on Gaussian
process (GP) theory. It is observed that linear operators acting upon a GP
again yield a GP. This also holds true for differential operators defining
differential equations and describing physical laws. If we demand the GP, or
equivalently the limit network, to obey the physical law, then this yields an
equation for the covariance function or kernel of the GP, whose solution
equivalently constrains the model to obey the physical law. The central limit
theorem then suggests that NNs can be constructed to obey a physical law by
choosing the activation functions such that they match a particular kernel in
the infinite-width limit. The activation functions constructed in this way
guarantee the NN to a priori obey the physics, up to the approximation error of
non-infinite network width. Simple examples of the homogeneous 1D-Helmholtz
equation are discussed and compared to naive kernels and activations.

eccentricity in the disk. We found that the combination of an eccentric orbital

Previous works on MBSs in planar Josephson junctions have focused on electron
gases, where SOI is linear in momentum. In contrast, a two-dimensional hole gas
in planar germanium (Ge) exhibits SOI that is cubic in momentum. Nevertheless,
we show here that due to the particularly large SOI, Ge is a favorable
material. Using a discretized model, we numerically simulate a Ge planar
Josephson junction and demonstrate that also cubic SOI can lead to the
emergence of MBSs. Interestingly, we find that the cubic SOI yields an
asymmetric phase diagram as a function of the superconducting phase difference
across the junction. We also find that trivial Andreev bound states can imitate
the signatures of MBSs in a Ge planar Josephson junction, therefore making the
experimental detection of MBSs difficult. We use experimentally realistic

limitations. Our analysis shows that two-dimensional Ge is an auspicious

step is Image Embedding, in which an encoder or optimization process embeds

to refine the inversion and editing results, which we named Result Refinement.
Although the second step significantly improves fidelity, perception and
editability are almost unchanged, deeply dependent on inverse latent codes
attained in the first step. Therefore, a crucial problem is gaining the latent
codes with better perception and editability while retaining the reconstruction
fidelity. In this work, we first point out that these two characteristics are
related to the degree of alignment (or disalignment) of the inverse codes with
the synthetic distribution. Then, we propose Latent Space Alignment Inversion
Paradigm (LSAP), which consists of evaluation metric and solution for this

important insights into a range of physical and chemical properties of various
molecular and solid-state systems. Their importance to various fields,
including materials science, chemical sciences, computational chemistry and
device physics, is underscored by the large fraction of available public
supercomputing resources devoted to these calculations. As we enter the
exascale era, exciting new opportunities to increase simulation numbers, sizes,
and accuracies present themselves. In order to realize these promises, the
community of electronic structure software developers will however first have
to tackle a number of challenges pertaining to the efficient use of new
architectures that will rely heavily on massive parallelism and hardware
accelerators. This roadmap provides a broad overview of the state-of-the-art in
electronic structure calculations and of the various new directions being
pursued by the community. It covers 14 electronic structure codes, presenting
their current status, their development priorities over the next five years,
and their plans towards tackling the challenges and leveraging the
opportunities presented by the advent of exascale computing.

development of emerging intelligent transportation systems. Nevertheless, the
limited resources and massive transmission demands bring great challenges on
implementing vehicular applications with stringent deadline requirements. This
work presents a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based architecture in
VEC, where heterogeneous edge nodes are cooperated for real-time task
processing. We derive a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) transmission model by
considering both intra-edge and inter-edge interferences and formulate a
cooperative resource optimization (CRO) problem by jointly optimizing the task
offloading and resource allocation, aiming at maximizing the service ratio.
Further, we decompose the CRO into two subproblems, namely, task offloading and
resource allocation. In particular, the task offloading subproblem is modeled
as an exact potential game (EPG), and a multi-agent distributed distributional
deep deterministic policy gradient (MAD4PG) is proposed to achieve the Nash
equilibrium. The resource allocation subproblem is divided into two independent
convex optimization problems, and an optimal solution is proposed by using a
gradient-based iterative method and KKT condition. Finally, we build the
simulation model based on real-world vehicle trajectories and give a
comprehensive performance evaluation, which conclusively demonstrates the
superiority of the proposed solutions.

of quasiparticle types in the gapped domain walls; we also find the $S$ and $T$

dissipating magnetic energy in collisionless plasmas. However, their existence

Landau damping and difficulties in resolving the Debye length scale in the
laboratory. Here we report a sudden onset of ion acoustic bursts measured by
collective Thomson scattering in the exhaust of anti-parallel magnetically

followed by electron acoustic bursts with electron heating and bulk
acceleration. We reproduce these observations with 1D and 2D particle-in-cell
simulations in which electron outflow jet drives ion-acoustic instabilities,
forming double layers. These layers induce electron two-stream instabilities
that generate electron acoustic bursts and energize electrons. Our results
demonstrate the importance of ion and electron acoustic dynamics during
reconnection when ion Landau damping is ineffective, a condition applicable to
a range of astrophysical plasmas including near-Earth space, stellar flares,

fine-structure line features are generated using the configuration-interaction
approach. These actinide opacities display similar trends to those observed for
lanthanide opacities, such as the lighter actinides producing higher opacity
than the heavier ones for relevant conditions in the dynamical ejecta. A
line-binned treatment is employed to pre-compute opacity tables for 14 actinide
elements $(89 \le Z \le 102)$ over a grid of relevant temperatures and
densities. These tabular opacities will be made publicly available for general
usage in kilonova modeling. We demonstrate the usefulness of these opacities in
kilonova simulations by exploring the sensitivity of light curves and spectra
to different actinide abundance distributions that are predicted by different
nuclear theories, as well as to different choices of ejecta mass and velocity.
We find very little sensitivity to the two considered distributions, indicating
that opacities for actinides with $Z \ge 99$ do not contribute strongly. On the
other hand, a single actinide element, protactinium, is found to produce faint
spectral features in the far infrared at late times (5-7 days post merger).
More generally, we find that the choice of ejecta mass and velocity have the
most significant effect on KN emission for this study.

forward uncertainty propagation and allows for fast, real-time risk estimation.
The paper also proposes a novel, asymmetric loss function and shows that models
trained using the asymmetric loss perform better than those using symmetric

assessing the risk of insufficient operating reserves, the risk of load

the capability of registration with unknown scale is necessary in tasks such as
CAD model-based object localization, yet no such support exists in functional
registration. In this work, we propose a scale-invariant, linear time
complexity functional registration algorithm. We achieve linear time complexity
through an efficient approximation of L2-distance between functions using
orthonormal basis functions. The use of orthonormal basis functions leads to a
formulation that is compatible with least-squares registration. Benefited from
the least-square formulation, we use the theory of
translation-rotation-invariant measurement to decouple scale estimation and
therefore achieve scale-invariant registration. We evaluate the proposed
algorithm, named FLS (functional least-squares), on standard 3D registration
benchmarks, showing FLS is an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art
functional registration algorithm without compromising accuracy and robustness.
FLS also outperforms state-of-the-art correspondence-based least-squares
registration algorithm on accuracy and robustness, with known and unknown

recent years, while it has bias towards higher degree nodes in the sample. To
overcome this deficiency, classical methods such as GMD modify the topology of
target graphs so that the long-term behavior of Markov chain can achieve
uniform distribution. This modification, however, reduces the conductance of
graphs, thus makes the sampler stay in the same node for long time, resulting
in undersampling. To address this issue, we propose a new way of modifying

improve the performance. We prove that WJRW can unify Simple Random Walk and
uniform distribution through C, and we also conduct extensive experiments on

data-parallel distributed training. Unlike most deep learning compilers that
focus on training or inference on a single device, DisCo optimizes a DNN model
for distributed training over multiple GPU machines. Existing single-device
compilation strategies do not work well in distributed training, due mainly to
communication inefficiency that they incur. DisCo generates optimized, joint
computation operator and communication tensor fusion strategies to enable
highly efficient distributed training. A GNN-based simulator is built to
effectively estimate per-iteration training time achieved by operator/tensor
fusion candidates. A backtracking search algorithm is driven by the simulator,
navigating efficiently in the large strategy space to identify good
operator/tensor fusion strategies that minimize distributed training time. We
compare DisCo with existing DL fusion schemes and show that it achieves good
training speed-up close to the ideal, full computation-communication overlap
case.

engineering, and construction due to their high-quality object representation
and efficient acquisition methods. Consequently, many point cloud feature
detection methods have been proposed in the literature to automate some
workflows, such as their classification or part segmentation. Nevertheless, the
performance of point cloud automated systems significantly lags behind their
image counterparts. While part of this failure stems from the irregularity,
unstructuredness, and disorder of point clouds, which makes the task of point
cloud feature detection significantly more challenging than the image one, we
argue that a lack of inspiration from the image domain might be the primary
cause of such a gap. Indeed, given the overwhelming success of Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) in image feature detection, it seems reasonable to
design their point cloud counterparts, but none of the proposed approaches
closely resembles them. Specifically, even though many approaches generalise
the convolution operation in point clouds, they fail to emulate the CNNs
multiple-feature detection and pooling operations. For this reason, we propose
a graph convolution-based unit, dubbed Shrinking unit, that can be stacked
vertically and horizontally for the design of CNN-like 3D point cloud feature
extractors. Given that self, local and global correlations between points in a
point cloud convey crucial spatial geometric information, we also leverage them
during the feature extraction process. We evaluate our proposal by designing a
feature extractor model for the ModelNet-10 benchmark dataset and achieve
90.64% classification accuracy, demonstrating that our innovative idea is
effective. Our code is available at github.com/albertotamajo/Shrinking-unit.

Here, we show that the TIR of Bloch waves can be directly obtained based on the
generalized Fresnel equations proposed. If each of these Bloch waves picks up a
phase with integer multiples of 2pi for traveling a round trip, light can be
perfectly guided in the slab, namely, forming a BIC. A BIC solver with low
computational complexity and fast convergence speed is developed, which can
also work efficiently at high frequencies beyond the diffraction limit where
multiple radiation channels exist. Two examples of multi-channel BICs are
shown, and their topological nature in momentum space is also revealed. Both
can be attributed to the coincidence of the topological charges of far-field
radiations from different radiation channels. The concept of the generalized
TIR and the TIR-based BIC solver developed offer highly effective approaches
for explorations of BICs which could have many potential applications in
guided-wave optics and enhanced light-matter interactions.

has been studied with graph theoretical tools. One such approach is community
detection which is fundamental for uncovering the localized networks. Existing
methods focus on networks constructed from a single frequency band while
ignoring multi-frequency nature of functional connectivity. Therefore, there is
a need to study multi-frequency functional connectivity to be able to capture
the full view of neuronal connectivity. Methods: In this paper, we use
multilayer networks to model multi-frequency functional connectivity. In the
proposed model, each layer corresponds to a different frequency band. We then
extend the definition of modularity to multilayer networks to develop a new
community detection algorithm. Results} The proposed approach is applied to
electroencephalogram data collected during a study of error monitoring in the
human brain. The differences between the community structures within and across
different frequency bands for two response types, i.e. error and correct, are
studied. Conclusion: The results indicate that following an error response, the
brain organizes itself to form communities across frequencies, in particular
between theta and gamma bands while a similar cross-frequency community
formation is not observed for the correct response. Moreover, the community
structures detected for the error response were more consistent across subjects
compared to the community structures for correct response. Significance: The
multi-frequency functional connectivity network models combined with multilayer
community detection algorithms can reveal changes in cross-frequency functional
connectivity network formation across different tasks and response types.

from reporting bias: texts rarely report on common facts, instead focusing on
the unusual aspects of a situation. If LMs are only trained on text corpora and
naively memorise local co-occurrence statistics, they thus naturally would
learn a biased view of the physical world. While prior studies have repeatedly
verified that LMs of smaller scales (e.g., RoBERTa, GPT-2) amplify reporting
bias, it remains unknown whether such trends continue when models are scaled
up. We investigate reporting bias from the perspective of colour in larger
language models (LLMs) such as PaLM and GPT-3. Specifically, we query LLMs for
the typical colour of objects, which is one simple type of perceptually
grounded physical common sense. Surprisingly, we find that LLMs significantly
outperform smaller LMs in determining an object's typical colour and more
closely track human judgments, instead of overfitting to surface patterns
stored in texts. This suggests that very large models of language alone are
able to overcome certain types of reporting bias that are characterized by
local co-occurrences.

nonlinear evolution are extracted. On the one side, by perturbing the scalar
source, an isolated seed nucleus is injected into an initial homogeneous state
in the supercooled region. For critical parameters of the seed nucleus, the
real-time dynamics reveal that the system will converge to a critically
unstable state. For supercritical parameters, the system exhibits a phase
separation, while for subcritical parameters falls back to homogeneous. The
shape independence of the seed nucleus is also investigated, which implies that
the critical phenomena are universal. On the other side, we propose a novel
mechanism to render the critical phenomena via a collision of two gravitational
shock waves on the dual geometries. Specifying a collision velocity, the
initial system can be also attracted to a critically unstable state. Aside from
these dynamical constructions, we also quantitatively analyze the critical

the depth of the critical nucleus increases almost linearly with the

by warm, entrained dust. Previous analyses of near- and mid-IR interferometric

accretion disk with a moderate ($i < 40$ degrees) inclination. We have obtained
5-40 micron images of MWC 297 with FORCAST on SOFIA, as well as near-infrared
spectra acquired with SpeX on the IRTF and radio data obtained with the VLA and
BIMA, and supplemented these with archival data from Herschel/PACS and SPIRE.
The FORCAST images, combined with the VLA data, indicate that the outflow lobes
are aligned nearly north-south and are well separated. Simple geometrical
modeling of the FORCAST images suggests that the disk driving the outflow has
an inclination of $55\pm 5$ degrees, in disagreement with the results of the
interferometric analyses. Analysis of the SpeX data, with a wind model,
suggests the the mass loss rate is on the order of $6.0 \pm ^{3.7}_{1.7} \times

$0.35~ \mu$m to $6$ cm and estimate the total luminosity. We find the total
luminosity to be about $7900 ~ L_\odot$, if we include emission from an
extended region around the star, only slightly below that expected for a B1.5V

considered a promising solution. A major concern is the poor recognition
accuracy on low-resolution frames. We thus start by analyzing the underlying
causes of performance degradation on low-resolution frames. Our key finding is
that the major cause of degradation is not information loss in the
down-sampling process, but rather the mismatch between network architecture and
input scale. Motivated by the success of knowledge distillation (KD), we
propose to bridge the gap between network and input size via cross-resolution
KD (ResKD). Our work shows that ResKD is a simple but effective method to boost
recognition accuracy on low-resolution frames. Without bells and whistles,
ResKD considerably surpasses all competitive methods in terms of efficiency and
accuracy on four large-scale benchmark datasets, i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID,
Mini-Kinetics, Something-Something V2. In addition, we extensively demonstrate
its effectiveness over state-of-the-art architectures, i.e., 3D-CNNs and Video

suggest ResKD can serve as a general inference acceleration method for

of the currently available data, especially from the $E_g$ data, the
reconstruction of Newton's constant is consistent with a constant value within
the errors. On the other hand, the anisotropic stress deviates strongly from
unity due to the sparsity and the systematics of the $E_g$ data. Finally, we
also create synthetic data based on a next-generation survey and forecast the
limits of any possible detection of deviations from GR. In particular, we use
two fiducial models: one based on the cosmological constant $\Lambda$CDM model
and another on a model with an evolving Newton's constant, dubbed $\mu$CDM. We
find that the GA reconstructions of $\mu(z)$ and $\eta(z)$ can be constrained
to within a few percent of the fiducial models and in the case of the $\mu$CDM

subfield occupied with such a problem is termed site response analysis (SRA),
its one-dimensional flavor (1D-SRA) being particularly popular given its
simplicity. Despite the simple geometrical setting, a paramount challenge
remains when it comes to numerically consider intense shaking in the soft upper
soil strata of the crust: how to mathematically model the high-strain,
dissipative, potentially rate-dependent soil behavior. Both heuristics models
and phenomenological constitutive laws have been developed to meet the
challenge, neither of them being exempt of either numerical limitations or
physical inadequacies or both. We propose herein to bring the novel data-driven
paradigm to bear, thus giving away with the need to construct constitutive
behavior models altogether. Data-driven computational mechanics (DDCM) is a
novel paradigm in solid mechanics that is gaining popularity; in particular,
the multiscale version of it relies on studying the response of the
microstructure (in the case of soil, representative volumes containing grains)
to populate a dataset that is later used to inform the response at the
macroscale. This manuscript presents the first application of multiscale DDCM
to 1D-SRA: first, we demonstrate its capacity to handle wave propagation
problems using discrete datasets, obtained via sampling grain ensembles using
the discrete element method (DEM), in lieu of a constitutive law and then we
apply it specifically to analyze the propagation of harmonic waves in a soft
soil deposit that overlies rigid bedrock. We validate the implementation via
comparison to regular finite elements analyses (FEA) and demonstrate that
traditional amplification functions are recovered when using the DDCM.

algorithm which calculates the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian based on
parametrized quantum circuits, while a classical optimizer is used to find
optimal parameter values. However, quantum hardware is affected by noise, and
it needs to be understood to which extent it can degrade the performance of the
VQE algorithm. In this paper, we study the impact of noise on the example of
the hydrogen molecule. First, we compare the VQE performance for a set of
various optimizers, from which we find NFT to be the most suitable one. Next,
we quantify the effect of different noise sources by systematically increasing
their strength. The noise intensity is varied around values common to
superconducting devices of IBM Q, and curve fitting is used to model the
relationship between the obtained energy values and the noise magnitude. Since
the amount of noise in a circuit highly depends on its architecture, we perform
our studies for different ansatzes, including both hardware-efficient and

paper studies the effects of PLMs in TVG and assesses the applicability of
parameter-efficient training with NLP adapters. We couple popular PLMs with a
selection of existing approaches and test different adapters to reduce the
impact of the additional parameters. Our results on three challenging datasets
show that, without changing the visual inputs, TVG models greatly benefited
from the PLM integration and fine-tuning, stressing the importance of sentence
query representation in this task. Furthermore, NLP adapters were an effective
alternative to full fine-tuning, even though they were not tailored to our
task, allowing PLM integration in larger TVG models and delivering results
comparable to SOTA models. Finally, our results shed light on which adapters
work best in different scenarios.

inspection, search, and rescue operations by the virtue of low-cost,
large-coverage, real-time, and high-resolution data acquisition capacities.
Massive volumes of aerial videos are produced in these processes, in which
normal events often account for an overwhelming proportion. It is extremely
difficult to localize and extract abnormal events containing potentially
valuable information from long video streams manually. Therefore, we are
dedicated to developing anomaly detection methods to solve this issue. In this
paper, we create a new dataset, named DroneAnomaly, for anomaly detection in
aerial videos. This dataset provides 37 training video sequences and 22 testing
video sequences from 7 different realistic scenes with various anomalous
events. There are 87,488 color video frames (51,635 for training and 35,853 for
testing) with the size of $640 \times 640$ at 30 frames per second. Based on
this dataset, we evaluate existing methods and offer a benchmark for this task.
Furthermore, we present a new baseline model, ANomaly Detection with
Transformers (ANDT), which treats consecutive video frames as a sequence of
tubelets, utilizes a Transformer encoder to learn feature representations from
the sequence, and leverages a decoder to predict the next frame. Our network
models normality in the training phase and identifies an event with
unpredictable temporal dynamics as an anomaly in the test phase. Moreover, To
comprehensively evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we use not
only our Drone-Anomaly dataset but also another dataset. We will make our
dataset and code publicly available. A demo video is available at

backpropagation when there are fewer training samples or unpredictable

achieve the desired 2D power profile. The pump power optimization framework
includes a convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by differential
evolution (DE) technique, applied online to the amplifier setup to
automatically achieve the target 2D power profiles. The results on achievable

Moreover, the framework is tested in a multi-objective design scenario where
the goal is to achieve the 2D profiles with flat gain levels at the end of the

this case, the experimental results assert that for 2D profiles with the target
flat gain levels, the DE obtains less than 1 dB maximum gain deviation, when
the setup is not physically limited in the pump power values. The simulation

capabilities, their functioning does not allow a detailed explanation of their
behavior. Opaque deep learning models are increasingly used to make important
predictions in critical environments, and the danger is that they make and use
predictions that cannot be justified or legitimized. Several eXplainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods that separate explanations from machine
learning models have emerged, but have shortcomings in faithfulness to the
model actual functioning and robustness. As a result, there is a widespread
agreement on the importance of endowing Deep Learning models with explanatory
capabilities so that they can themselves provide an answer to why a particular
prediction was made. First, we address the problem of the lack of universal
criteria for XAI by formalizing what an explanation is. We also introduced a
set of axioms and definitions to clarify XAI from a mathematical perspective.
Finally, we present the Greybox XAI, a framework that composes a DNN and a
transparent model thanks to the use of a symbolic Knowledge Base (KB). We
extract a KB from the dataset and use it to train a transparent model (i.e., a
logistic regression). An encoder-decoder architecture is trained on RGB images
to produce an output similar to the KB used by the transparent model. Once the
two models are trained independently, they are used compositionally to form an

speaker usually begins with an intention and motivation of what is to be
communicated, and what effects are expected from the communication, while
taking into consideration the listener's mental model to concoct an appropriate
sentence. The listener likewise has to interpret what the speaker means, and
respond accordingly, also with the speaker's mental state in mind. To do this
successfully, conceptual, motivational, and affective processes have to be
represented appropriately to drive the language generation and understanding
processes. Language processing has succeeded well with the big data approach in
applications such as chatbots and machine translation. However, in human-robot
collaborative social communication and in using natural language for delivering
precise instructions to robots, a deeper representation of the conceptual,
motivational, and affective processes is needed. This paper capitalizes on the
UGALRS (Unified General Autonomous and Language Reasoning System) framework and
the CD+ (Conceptual Representation Plus) representational scheme to illustrate
how social communication through language is supported by a knowledge
representational scheme that handles conceptual, motivational, and affective
processes in a deep and general way. Though a small set of concepts,
motivations, and emotions is treated in this paper, its main contribution is in
articulating a general framework of knowledge representation and processing to
link these aspects together in serving the purpose of natural language
communication for an intelligent system.

prediction models typically show systematic errors and require post-processing

crucial in many practical applications, and various approaches to multivariate
post-processing have been proposed where ensemble predictions are first
post-processed separately in each margin and multivariate dependencies are then
restored via copulas. These two-step methods share common key limitations, in
particular the difficulty to include additional predictors in modeling the
dependencies. We propose a novel multivariate post-processing method based on
generative machine learning to address these challenges. In this new class of
nonparametric data-driven distributional regression models, samples from the
multivariate forecast distribution are directly obtained as output of a
generative neural network. The generative model is trained by optimizing a
proper scoring rule which measures the discrepancy between the generated and
observed data, conditional on exogenous input variables. Our method does not
require parametric assumptions on univariate distributions or multivariate
dependencies and allows for incorporating arbitrary predictors. In two case
studies on multivariate temperature and wind speed forecasting at weather
