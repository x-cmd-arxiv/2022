which requires solving hard constrained optimization problems iteratively. For
uncertain dynamics, analytical model based robust MPC imposes additional
constraints, increasing the hardness of the problem. The problem exacerbates in
performance-critical applications, when more compute is required in lesser
time. Data-driven regression methods such as Neural Networks have been proposed
in the past to approximate system dynamics. However, such models rely on high
volumes of labeled data, in the absence of symbolic analytical priors. This
incurs non-trivial training overheads. Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
have gained traction for approximating non-linear system of ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), with reasonable accuracy. In this work, we
propose a Robust Adaptive MPC framework via PINNs (RAMP-Net), which uses a
neural network trained partly from simple ODEs and partly from data. A physics
loss is used to learn simple ODEs representing ideal dynamics. Having access to
analytical functions inside the loss function acts as a regularizer, enforcing
robust behavior for parametric uncertainties. On the other hand, a regular data
loss is used for adapting to residual disturbances (non-parametric
uncertainties), unaccounted during mathematical modelling. Experiments are
performed in a simulated environment for trajectory tracking of a quadrotor. We
report 7.8% to 43.2% and 8.04% to 61.5% reduction in tracking errors for speeds
ranging from 0.5 to 1.75 m/s compared to two SOTA regression based MPC methods.

dynamics (CFD) studies in resource constrained settings are limited by the
available imaging modalities for geometry and velocity data acquisition.
Doppler echocardiography has been seen as a suitable velocity acquisition
modality due to its higher availability and safety. This study aimed to
investigate the application of classical machine learning (ML) methods to
create an adequate and robust approach for obtaining boundary conditions (BCs)
from Doppler Echocardiography images, for haemodynamic modeling using CFD.
  Methods- Our proposed approach combines ML and CFD to model haemodynamic flow
within the region of interest. With the key feature of the approach being the
use of ML models to calibrate the inlet and outlet boundary conditions (BCs) of
the CFD model. The key input variable for the ML model was the patients heart
rate as this was the parameter that varied in time across the measured vessels
within the study. ANSYS Fluent was used for the CFD component of the study
whilst the scikit-learn python library was used for the ML component.
  Results- We validated our approach against a real clinical case of severe CoA
before intervention. The maximum coarctation velocity of our simulations were
compared to the measured maximum coarctation velocity obtained from the patient
whose geometry is used within the study. Of the 5 ML models used to obtain BCs
the top model was within 5\% of the measured maximum coarctation velocity.
  Conclusion- The framework demonstrated that it was capable of taking
variations of the patients heart rate between measurements into account. Thus,
enabling the calculation of BCs that were physiologically realistic when the
heart rate was scaled across each vessel whilst providing a reasonably accurate
solution.

robustness and relatively inexpensive fabrication. An important dictator of
membrane performance are free volume elements (FVEs), microporous void spaces
created by the inefficient packing of bulky groups along the polymer chain.
FVEs tend to degrade over time as polymer chains reorganize irreversibly;
relating local chain dynamics to the distribution of FVEs can help control
phenomena like plasticization and aging. In this work, we implement all-atom
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study three polymers with different
glass transition temperatures (Tg): polymethylpentene (PMP), polystyrene (PS),
and HAB-6FDA thermally rearranged polymer (TRP). We observe that chain segments
near FVEs have higher mobility compared to the atoms in the bulk; the extent of
this difference is a function of Tg. To capture penetrant diffusion through the
polymer matrix, hydrogen is inserted, and the mean squared displacement is
calculated; penetrant mobility is dependent on both FVE distribution and
polymer chain dynamics.

a long secondary period, 5 to 10 times the pulsation period. The long secondary
periods were recently ascribed to eclipses of the red giant by a low-mass
dust-enshrouded companion. Long secondary periods have been known for over a
century. In this paper, I use primarily American Association of Variable Star
Observers visual and photoelectric observations to look for evidence of long
secondary periods in 103 red giant stars listed by Nancy Houk in 1963 as having
long secondary periods, based mostly on photographic photometry. I have
determined long secondary periods in 37 stars, and upper limits (some of them
not very stringent) in 25. In the former, the ratio of long secondary period to
pulsation period peaks strongly at 10, which suggests that most of the stars
are pulsating in the first overtone. The loong secondary periods are consistent
with those o0f Houk in 33 of the 37 stars. I have identified 16 stars as
bimodal pulsaters;their period ratios are consistent with previous
observational and theoretical results. For 14 stars,the periods in the General

and planar defects observed in our experiments, we performed atomic-scale ab
initio calculations focusing on the solute interactions with generalized
stacking faults in hcp $\alpha$-Zr and fcc zirconium hydrides. Our calculations
showed that an increase in Sn concentration leads to a stabilisation of
stacking faults in both $\alpha$-Zr and hydride phases. However, the solution
enthalpy of Sn is lower in the $\alpha$-Zr as compared to the other hydride
phases indicative of two competing processes of Sn depletion/enrichment at the
Zr hydride/matrix interface. This is corroborated by experimental findings,
where Sn is repelled by hydrides and is mostly found trapped at interfaces and
planar defects indicative of stacking faults inside the hydride phases. Our
systematic investigation enables us to understand the presence and distribution
of solutes in the hydride phases, which provides a deeper insight into the
microstructural evolution of such alloy's properties during its service

First of all, based on the property of semi-Markov chain, DM-SMCRFs can encode
segment-level features and sequentially classify the phrase in the sentence as
keyphrase or non-keyphrase. Second, by assuming the independence between state
transition and state duration, DM-SMCRFs model the distribution of duration
(length) of keyphrases to further explore state duration information, which can
help identify the size of keyphrase. Based on the convexity of parametric
duration feature derived from duration distribution, a constrained Viterbi

thoroughly evaluate the performance of DM-SMCRFs on the datasets from various

statement audits. Recently, novel methods derived from Deep-Learning (DL) have
been proposed to audit the large volumes of a statement's underlying accounting
records. However, due to their vast number of parameters, such models exhibit
the drawback of being inherently opaque. At the same time, the concealing of a
model's inner workings often hinders its real-world application. This
observation holds particularly true in financial audits since auditors must
reasonably explain and justify their audit decisions. Nowadays, various
Explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been proposed to address this challenge,
e.g., SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). However, in unsupervised DL as
often applied in financial audits, these methods explain the model output at
the level of encoded variables. As a result, the explanations of Autoencoder
Neural Networks (AENNs) are often hard to comprehend by human auditors. To
mitigate this drawback, we propose (RESHAPE), which explains the model output
on an aggregated attribute-level. In addition, we introduce an evaluation
framework to compare the versatility of XAI methods in auditing. Our
experimental results show empirical evidence that RESHAPE results in versatile
explanations compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We envision such
attribute-level explanations as a necessary next step in the adoption of
unsupervised DL techniques in financial auditing.

for three-dimensional Riemannian quantum gravity. First, we discuss aspects of
the topology of coloured graphs with non-empty boundaries. Using a modification
of the standard rooting procedure of coloured tensor models, we then write
transition amplitudes systematically as topological expansions. We analyse the
transition amplitudes for the simplest boundary topology, the 2-sphere, and
prove that they factorize into a sum entirely given by the combinatorics of the
boundary spin network state and that the leading order is given by graphs
representing the closed 3-ball in the large N limit. This is the first step
towards a more detailed study of the holographic nature of coloured
Boulatov-type GFT models for topological field theories and quantum gravity.

particularly, the lifting of some action invariants. The work is encouraged by
recent results of Austin, Glasner, Thouvenot, and Weiss. We prove that the
P-entropy of the generic extensions with finite P-entropy, which is an
invariant of the Kushnirenko entropy type, is infinite. A different approach is
exploited to obtain the result of the above-mentioned authors that the generic
extension of an deterministic action is not isomorphic to this action. We have
proved that generic cocycles are recurrent. It is shown that typical extensions
preserve the singularity of the spectrum, partial rigidity, mildly mixing,
mixing (we announced similar stability for multiple mixing and PID property of
actions). At the same time, the lifting of some algebraic properties under the
generic extension may depend on the statistical properties of the base. Typical
measurable families of automorphisms are considered as well. The dynamic
behavior of such families is a bit unusual. It is characterized by both dynamic
conformism and dynamic individualism of the representatives of the generic
family.

cell division, intracellular transport and motility. Recent experiments have
shown that microtubule severing proteins and molecular motors stimulate the
direct and localized incorporation of free tubulin into the shaft. However, a
mechanistic picture how microtubule associated proteins affect the lattice is
completely missing. Here we theoretically explore a potential mechanism of
lattice turnover stimulated by processive molecular motors in which a weak
transient destabilization of the lattice by the motor stepping promotes the
formation of mobile vacancies. In the absence of free tubulin the defect
rapidly propagates leading to a complete fracture. In the presence of free
tubulin, the motor walk induces a vacancy drift in the direction opposite of
the motor walk. The drift is accompanied by the direct and localized
incorporation of free tubulin along the trajectory of the vacancy. Our results
are consistent with experiments and strongly suggest that a weak lattice-motor
interaction is responsible for an augmented microtubule shaft plasticity.

functions has been an active area of research in the field of machine learning.
Prior work has shown that the noise of stochastic gradient descent improves
optimization by overcoming undesirable obstacles in the landscape. Moreover,
injecting artificial Gaussian noise has become a popular idea to quickly escape
saddle points. Indeed, in the absence of reliable gradient information, the
noise is used to explore the landscape, but it is unclear what type of noise is
optimal in terms of exploration ability. In order to narrow this gap in our
knowledge, we study a general type of continuous-time non-Markovian process,
based on fractional Brownian motion, that allows for the increments of the
process to be correlated. This generalizes processes based on Brownian motion,
such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We demonstrate how to discretize such
processes which gives rise to the new algorithm fPGD. This method is a
generalization of the known algorithms PGD and Anti-PGD. We study the
properties of fPGD both theoretically and empirically, demonstrating that it
possesses exploration abilities that, in some cases, are favorable over PGD and
Anti-PGD. These results open the field to novel ways to exploit noise for
training machine learning models.

as-synthesized AuNPs were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light

FE-SEM micrographs revealed spherical AuNPs with an average diameter of approx.
55 nm and rod-shaped AuNPs with an average length of approx. 170 nm for sample

unsupervised-learning method for heat, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC)
load disaggregation using low-resolution (e.g., 15 minutes) smart meter data.
We first demonstrate that electricity consumption profiles on mild-temperature
days can be used to estimate the non-HVAC base load on hot days. A residual
load profile can then be calculated by subtracting the mild-day load profile
from the hot-day load profile. The residual load profiles are processed using
ICA for HVAC load extraction. An optimization-based algorithm is proposed for
post-adjustment of the ICA results, considering two bounding factors for
enhancing the robustness of the ICA algorithm. First, we use the hourly HVAC
energy bounds computed based on the relationship between HVAC load and
temperature to remove unrealistic HVAC load spikes. Second, we exploit the
dependency between the daily nocturnal and diurnal loads extracted from
historical meter data to smooth the base load profile. Pecan Street data with
sub-metered HVAC data were used to test and validate the proposed
methods.Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method is
computationally efficient and robust across multiple customers.

surprisingly robust even for heavily disordered samples because of an
anomalously small edge state decay length and additional protection related to
the large direct gap allowed by glide symmetry. From the simulation of
temperature-dependent resistance, we find that moderate disorder enhances the

finding prospects for physics beyond linear helical Luttinger liquids in

processes in the physical and life sciences. Examples at the microscopic level
range from artificial membranes for reverse osmosis to lipid bilayers
regulating molecular transport in biological cells to chemical and electrical
gap junctions. There are also macroscopic analogs such as animal migration in
heterogeneous landscapes. It has recently been shown that one-dimensional
diffusion through a barrier with constant permeability $\kappa_0$ is equivalent
to snapping out Brownian motion (BM). The latter sews together successive
rounds of partially reflecting BMs that are restricted to either the left or
right of the barrier. Each round is killed when its Brownian local time exceeds
an exponential random variable parameterized by $\kappa_0$. A new round is then
immediately started in either direction with equal probability. In this paper
we use a combination of renewal theory, Laplace transforms and Green's function
methods to show how an extended version of snapping out BM provides a general
probabilistic framework for modeling diffusion through a semipermeable barrier.
This includes modifications of the diffusion process away from the barrier (eg.
stochastic resetting) and non-Markovian models of membrane absorption that kill
each round of partially reflected BM. The latter leads to time-dependent
permeabilities.

the confidential information of all users. Assuming that both the legitimate
receiver and Eve jointly decode their interested messages, we aim to maximize
the sum secrecy rate of the system by precoder design. Although this problem
could be solved by first using the iterative majorization minimization (MM)
based algorithm to get a sequence of convex log-determinant optimization
subproblems and then using some general tools, e.g., the interior point method,
to deal with each subproblem, this strategy involves quite high computational
complexity. Therefore, we propose a simultaneous diagonalization based
low-complexity (SDLC) method to maximize the secrecy rate of a simple one-user
wiretap channel, and then use this method to iteratively optimize the
covariance matrix of each user. Simulation results show that in contrast to the
existing approaches, the SDLC scheme achieves similar secrecy performance but
requires much lower complexity.

straight rods preferentially diffuse along their long axis, but exhibit
significantly suppressed rotational diffusion. Entangled helical filaments
escape their confining tube by corkscrewing through the dense obstacles created

that shape-diblocks become permanently jammed at exceedingly low densities. We
also measure the rheological properties of semi-dilute suspensions and relate
their mechanical properties to the microscopic dynamics of constituent

removing noise from images, the best denoising performance has been reported in
a supervised learning setup that requires a large set of paired noisy images

unsupervised learning techniques, however, accurate modelling of images or
noise variance is still crucial for high-quality solutions. The learning
problem is ill-posed for unknown noise distributions. This paper investigates
the tasks of image denoising and noise variance estimation in a single, joint
learning framework. To address the ill-posedness of the problem, we present
deep variation prior (DVP), which states that the variation of a properly
learnt denoiser with respect to the change of noise satisfies some smoothness
properties, as a key criterion for good denoisers. Building upon DVP, an
unsupervised deep learning framework, that simultaneously learns a denoiser and
estimates noise variances, is developed. Our method does not require any clean
training images or an external step of noise estimation, and instead,
approximates the minimum mean squared error denoisers using only a set of noisy
images. With the two underlying tasks being considered in a single framework,
we allow them to be optimised for each other. The experimental results show a
denoising quality comparable to that of supervised learning and accurate noise

modes are analytically determined. On the other hand, for models IV and V,
massive modes are all obtained: a finite number of massive states is identified
for model IV, while an infinite but discrete number of massive states bounded

the naked singularities of models IV and V, at edges of space, are made

process regression to derive the simplest time-dependent magnetic topology
consistent with the data. Assuming a linear relation between the Stokes $V$
data and the reconstructed magnetic image, TIMeS is currently applicable to
cases in which the magnetic field is not too strong (with an upper limit
depending on $v\sin{i}$). We applied TIMeS to several simulated data sets to
investigate its ability to retrieve the poloidal and toroidal components of
large-scale magnetic topologies. We find that the proposed method works best in
conditions similar to those needed for ZDI, reconstructing reliable topologies
with minor discrepancies at very low latitudes whose contribution to the data
is small. We however note that TIMeS can fail at reconstructing the input
topology when the field evolves on a timescale much shorter than the stellar
rotation cycle

cumbersome cables to read the force values from the sensors. Finally, we need

Secondly, it introduces a new mechanism to transduce the force information on
ambient RF radiations that can be read by a remotely located reader wirelessly

interfacing the sensors with COTS RFID systems. The sensor can detect forces in
the range of $0$-$6$~N with sensing accuracy of $<0.5$~N across multiple

providing more structural information in a scene to refine and generate more

quantum processing device depends on the availability of high-quality
entangling gates. Two important goals in the design and implementation of any
entangling gate are low error rates and high connectivity. The former minimizes
unintended perturbations to the quantum state during application of that gate,
while the latter maximizes the set of qubits that can interact directly without
remapping the QIP task through intermediary qubits -- a step that can require
many additional gates. Unfortunately, these goals can sometimes conflict,
necessitating a careful trade-off. In this work, we study that trade-off in
two-dimensional (2D) arrays of neutral atoms interacting through two-qubit
gates mediated by the Rydberg blockade effect. The connectivity associated with
Rydberg mediated gates on a 2D array is limited by the strength of the Rydberg
blockade shift, which decays with distance. Whereas a common strategy to
improving connectivity is to use Rydberg levels with larger dipole moments,
doing so also leaves the atom more susceptible to electric field noise. Here,
we simulate the performance of various logical QIP operations under realistic
noise sources and for a variety of Rydberg levels in order to evaluate the
connectivity versus gate error trade-off. We find that under many noise
regimes, a preferred range of interaction emerges that best satisfies that
trade-off. While the exact optimum interaction range depends closely on the
details of the atomic implementation, we present simple scaling arguments with
broad applicability that should inform future hardware and compiler design
choices.

frame, and only requires a constant time update each frame. Based on this idea,
we build TeSTra, a Temporal Smoothing Transformer, that takes in arbitrarily
long inputs with constant caching and computing overhead. Specifically, it runs
$6\times$ faster than equivalent sliding-window based transformers with 2,048
frames in a streaming setting. Furthermore, thanks to the increased temporal
span, TeSTra achieves state-of-the-art results on THUMOS'14 and
EPIC-Kitchen-100, two standard online action detection and action anticipation

reshaping of the Fermi surface, and a pseudogap regime at low doping in which
quasiparticle excitations are selectively destroyed near the antinodal regions

show that it forms both at weak coupling when the magnetic correlation length

elements of this discussion are as follows:
  1. We provide an illustration of how linear coaddition schemes can produce a

choices of weight functions.
  2. We provide a more formal demonstration of the fact that a linear coadd

  3. We discuss some reasons that two plausible nonlinear coaddition algorithms

  4. We demonstrate that all nonlinear coaddition procedures fail to produce a
well-defined PSF for extended objects.
  In the end, we conclude that, for any purpose where a well-defined PSF is
desired, one should use a linear coaddition scheme with weights that do not

production of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in a reducing, predominantly H$_2$
atmosphere. HCN is crucial for the origin of life as it is a possible precursor
to several biomolecules that make up RNA and proteins including nucleobases,
nucleotides, amino acids, and ribose. In this work, we perform an in depth
experimental and theoretical investigation of HCN production in reducing
atmospheric conditions (89-95% H$_2$) possibly representing the earliest stages
of the Hadean eon, ~4.5-4.3 billion years ago. We make use of cold plasma
discharges - a laboratory analog to shortwave UV radiation - to simulate HCN
production in the upper layers of the atmosphere for CH$_4$ abundances ranging
from 0.1-6.5%. We then combine experimental mass spectrum measurements with our
theoretical plasma models to estimate the HCN concentrations produced in our
experiments. We find that upper atmospheric HCN production scales linearly with
CH$_4$ abundance with the relation [HCN] = 0.13 $\pm$ 0.01[CH$_4$].
Concentrations of HCN near the surface of the Hadean Earth are expected to be
about 2-3 orders of magnitude lower. The addition of 1% water to our
experiments results in a ~50% reduction in HCN production. We find that four
reactions are primarily responsible for HCN production in our experiments: (i)
$^4$N + CH$_3$ -> H$_2$CN + H -> HCN + H$_2$, (ii) $^4$N + CH -> CN + H
followed by CN + CH$_4$ -> HCN + CH$_3$, (iii) C$_2$H$_4$ + $^4$N -> HCN +
CH$_3$, and (iv) $^4$N + $^3$CH$_2$ -> HCN + H. The most prebiotically
favorable Hadean atmosphere would have been very rich in CH$_4$ (> 5%), and as
a result of greenhouse effects the surface would be likely very hot. In such a
prebiotic scenario, it may have been important to incorporate HCN into organic
hazes that could later release biomolecules and precursors into the first
ponds.

tangential discontinuity known as a cold front, superimposed on a universal
radial entropy profile with a linear $K(r)\propto T\rho^{-2/3}\propto r$

solution for the mixed intracluster medium (ICM), introducing a modest pressure
spiral that confines the locally buoyant or heavy plasma phases. The solution
persists in the presence of uniform or differential rotation, and can
accommodate both an inflow and an outflow. Hydrodynamic adiabatic simulations
with perturbations that deposit angular momentum and mix the plasma thus
asymptote to a self-similar spiral structure. We find similar spirals in
Eulerian and Lagrangian simulations of 2D and 3D, merger and offset, clusters.
The discontinuity surface is given in spherical coordinates $\{r,\theta,\phi\}$
by $\phi(r,\theta)\propto \Phi(r)$, where $\Phi$ is the gravitational
potential, combining a trailing spiral in the equatorial ($\theta=\pi/2$) plane
and semicircles perpendicular to the plane, in resemblance of a snail shell. A
local convective instability can develop between spiral windings, driving a
modified global instability in sublinear $K(r)$ regions; evolved spirals thus
imprint the observed $K\propto r$ onto the ICM even after they dissipate. The
spiral structure brings hot and cold phases to close proximity, suggesting that
the observed fast outflows could sustain the structure even in the presence of

These temperature and density profiles are in disagreement with an adiabatic

additional physics such as mass loading and non-spherical outflow geometry. Our

satellite galaxies (Antlia and Antlia B), both of which are HI deficient

that they could not have been quenched solely by direct ram pressure stripping

find that separation of the satellites from pristine gas inflows, coupled with
stellar-feedback-driven outflows from the satellites (jointly referred to as
the starvation quenching model), can quench the satellites on timescales
consistent with their likely infall times into NGC 3109's halo. It is currently
believed that starvation is caused by ""weak"" ram pressure that prevents
low-density, weakly-bound gas from being accreted onto the dwarf satellite, but
cannot directly remove the denser interstellar medium. This suggests that
star-formation-driven outflows serve two purposes in quenching satellites in
low-mass environments: outflows from the host form a low-density circumgalactic
medium that cannot directly strip the interstellar media from its satellites,
but is sufficient to remove loosely-bound gaseous outflows from the dwarf
satellites driven by their own star formation.

This behaviour is in strike contrast to previous conjectural accounts in the

the logarithm of the Sudakov form factor is identical to twice the logarithm of
the null octagon $\mathbb{O}_0$, which was recently introduced within the
context of integrability-based approaches to four point correlation functions
with infinitely-large R-charges. The null octagon $\mathbb{O}_0$ is known in a
closed form for all values of the 't Hooft coupling constant and kinematical

of the host star, and by extension the planet. Several theoretical,
semi-empirical, and nearly empirical methods have been used to break this
degeneracy and independently measure the mass and radius of the host star and
planets(s). As we approach an era of few percent precisions on some of these
properties, it is critical to assess whether these different methods are
providing accuracies that are of the same order, or better than, the stated
statistical precisions. We investigate the differences in the planet parameter
estimates inferred when using the Torres empirical relations, YY isochrones,
MIST isochrones, and a nearly-direct empirical measurement of the radius of the
host star using its spectral energy distribution, effective temperature, and
\textit{Gaia} parallax. We focus our analysis on modelling KELT-15b, a fairly

implies that the gas responsible for NH$_3$ emission is broadly tracing the

the 'mode' of star formation, this hints that the nature of star formation in
extreme starbursts in the early Universe is similar to that of Galactic
star-forming regions, with a large fraction of the cold interstellar medium in

inform us on both internal (e.g. outflows) and external (e.g. mergers, tidal
interactions, ram pressure stripping) processes that shape galaxy evolution.
Understanding which of these primarily drive HI profile asymmetry is of
particular interest. In the lead-up to SKA pathfinder and SKA HI emission
surveys, hydrodynamical simulations have proved to be a useful resource for
such studies. Here we present the methodology behind, as well as first results,
of ASymba: Asymmetries in HI of Simba galaxies, the first time this simulation
suite has been used for this type of study. We generate mock observations of
the HI content of these galaxies and calculate the profile asymmetries using
three different methods. We find that $M_{\rm HI}$ has the strongest
correlation with all asymmetry measures, with weaker correlations also found
with the number of mergers a galaxy has undergone, and gas and galaxy rotation.
We also find good agreement with the xGASS sample, in that galaxies with highly
asymmetric profiles tend to have lower HI gas fractions than galaxies with
symmetric profiles, and additionally find the same holds in sSFR parameter
space. For low HI mass galaxies, it is difficult to distinguish between
asymmetric and symmetric galaxies, but this becomes achievable in the high HI
mass population. These results showcase the potential of ASymba and provide the
groundwork for further studies, including comparison to upcoming large HI

hosts of jetted NLS1 galaxies, a particular subclass of these sources hosting a
relativistic jet, are disk-like, or elliptical, as the hosts of more powerful
jetted AGN. We studied the host morphologies of 14 NLS1 galaxies, 11 of which
have been detected at 37 GHz indicating that these sources harbour relativistic
jets. The J- and Ks-band data used in this study were obtained with the Nordic
Optical Telescope (NOT). We performed the photometric decomposition of the host
galaxy using the band that gave a better fit, and additionally, created colour
maps of all sources that had both a J- and a Ks-band observation. We were able
to successfully model 12 sources, nine of which most likely have disk-like
morphology. Of the remaining sources, one source could possibly be hosted
either in a disk-like or a dwarf galaxy, and in two cases the results are
inconclusive. Only one of our sources shows clear signs of interaction, but the
colour maps of most of our sources hint at ample dust in the nuclei, possibly
indicating earlier minor mergers, that can go unnoticed due to the limited
resolution of these observations. Our results further support disk-like
galaxies as the predominant host type of jetted NLS1 galaxies. Most
importantly, with the number of modelled hosts of jetted NLS1s now exceeding
50, with only a few elliptical hosts, it seems to be safe to conclude that also
disk-like galaxies are able to launch and maintain relativistic jets, and that
the traditional jet paradigm stating that only massive elliptical galaxies are
capable of hosting relativistic jets is severely outdated.

Investigating the statistical properties of massive binary stars is essential
to trace the formation of massive stars and constrain the evolution of stellar
populations. However, no consensus has been achieved on the statistical
properties of massive binary stars, mainly due to the lack of a large and
homogeneous sample of spectroscopic observations. We study the intrinsic binary
fraction $f_{\rm b}^{\rm in}$ and distributions of mass ratio $f(q)$ and
orbital period $f(P)$ of early-type stars (comprised of O-, B-, and A-type
stars) and investigate their dependences on effective temperature $T_{\rm
eff}$, stellar metallicity [M/H], and the projection velocity $v\sin{i}$, based
on the homogeneous spectroscopic sample from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object
Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) Data Release Eight (DR8). We found that
$f_{\rm b}^{\rm in}$ increases with increasing $T_\mathrm{eff}$. The binary
fraction is positively correlated with metallicity for spectra in the sample.
Over all the $v\sin{i}$ values we considered, the $f_{\rm b}^{\rm in}$ have
constant values of $\sim$50\%. It seems that the binary population is
relatively evenly distributed over a wide range of $v\sin{i}$ values, while the
whole sample shows that most of the stars are concentrated at low values of
$v\sin{i}$ (probably from strong wind and magnetic braking of single massive
stars) and at high values of $v\sin{i}$ (likely from the merging of binary
stars). Stellar evolution and binary interaction may be partly responsible for
this.There are no correlations found between $\pi$($\gamma$) and $T_{\rm eff}$,
nor for $\pi$($\gamma$) and [M/H]. The uncertainties of the distribution
decrease toward a larger sample size with higher observational cadence.

ostensibly quantum regime where both matter and light exhibit non-classical
features. This paper shows that the interaction which gives rise to the
light-bending also induces photon-matter entanglement as long as gravity and
matter are treated at par with quantum mechanics. The quantum light-bending
interaction within the framework of perturbative quantum gravity highlights
this point by showing that the entangled states can be generated already with
coherent states of light and matter exploiting the non-linear coupling induced
by graviton exchange. Furthermore, the quantum light-bending interaction is
capable of discerning between the spin-2 and spin-0 gravitons thus also
providing a test for alternative theories of gravity at short distances and at
the quantum level. We will conclude by estimating the order of magnitude of the
entanglement generated by employing the linear entropy. In particular, we find
that a ring cavity of radius $0.25$ m placed around a $10$ kg mechanical
oscillator operating at $150$ Hz ($0.1$ Hz), could be used to generate linear

study of the AGN feedback's influence in the intra-group medium (IGrM). Our
results showcase a prominent, extended distribution of cool gas along the
group's NE-SW direction, correlating with the direction along which the
supermassive black hole in the group's central galaxy is known to interact with
the IGrM. Our analysis indicates gas being uplifted from the group's centre as
the probable origin of the cool gas, although alternative scenarios, such as
in-situ cooling can not be explicitly ruled out. Regarding the chemical
structure of the IGrM, and unlike previous findings in massive clusters, we
find no evidence for recent metal transport by jets/lobes from the central AGN.
Instead, elemental abundances remain near Solar on average across the group.
The distribution of elements appears to be independent of galactocentric
radius, azimuth and the thermodynamics of the gas, suggesting that the IGrM has
been efficiently mixed. The large scale uniformity of the abundance
distribution implies the presence of complex dynamical processes in NGC 5813,
despite its overall relaxed morphology. Past events of extreme AGN feedback or
sloshing could be the primary mechanisms behind this.

  scenarios: subjective perspectives of agents within a single quantum circuit","33 + 14 pages, 10 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It is natural to expect a complete physical theory to have the ability to
consistently model agents as physical systems of the theory. In [Nat. Comms. 9,
3711 (2018)], Frauchiger and Renner (FR) claim to show that when agents in
quantum theory reason about each other's knowledge in a certain Wigner's friend
scenario, they arrive at a logical contradiction. In light of this, Renner
often poses the challenge: provide a set of reasoning rules that can be used to
program quantum computers that may act as agents, which are (a) logically
consistent (b) generalise to arbitrary Wigner's friend scenarios (c)
efficiently programmable and (d) consistent with the temporal order of the
protocol. Here we develop a general framework where we show that every logical
Wigner's friend scenario (LWFS) can be mapped to a single temporally ordered
quantum circuit, which allows agents in any LWFS to reason in a way that meets
all four criteria of the challenge. Importantly, our framework achieves this
general resolution without modifying classical logic or unitary quantum
evolution or the Born rule, while allowing agents' perspectives to be
fundamentally subjective. We analyse the FR protocol in detail, showing how the
apparent paradox is resolved there. We show that apparent logical
contradictions in any LWFS only arise when ignoring the choice of Heisenberg
cut in scenarios where this choice does matter, and taking this dependence into
account will always resolve the apparent paradox. Our results establish that
universal applicability of quantum theory does not pose any threat to
multi-agent logical reasoning and we discuss the implications of these results
for FR's no-go theorem. Moreover, our formalism suggests the possibility of a
truly relational and operational description of Wigner's friend scenarios that
is consistent with quantum theory as well as probability theory applied to
measurement outcomes.

disks are crucial ingredients for our understanding of planet formation.
Measuring the gas mass is complicated, since H$_2$ cannot be detected in the
cold bulk of the disk and the elemental abundances with respect to hydrogen are
degenerate with gas mass in all disk models. We present new NOEMA observations
of CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O and optically thin C$^{17}$O $J$=2-1 lines, and use
additional high angular resolution Atacama Large Millimeter Array millimeter
continuum and CO data to construct a representative model of LkCa 15. The
transitions that constrain the gas mass and carbon abundance most are C$^{17}$O
2-1, N${_2}$H$^+$ 3-2 and HD 1-0. Using these three molecules we find that the
gas mass in the LkCa 15 disk is $M_\mathrm{g}=0.01 ^{+0.01}_{-0.004}
M_{\odot}$, a factor of six lower than estimated before. The carbon abundance
is C/H = ($3 \pm 1.5) \times10^{-5}$, implying a moderate depletion of
elemental carbon by a factor of 3-9. All other analyzed transitions also agree
with these numbers, within a modeling uncertainty of a factor of two. Using the
resolved \ce{C2H} image we find a C/O ratio of $\sim$1, which is consistent
with literature values of H$_2$O depletion in this disk. The lack of severe
carbon depletion in the LkCa 15 disk is consistent with the young age of the
disk, but contrasts with the higher depletions seen in older cold transition
disks. Combining optically thin CO isotopologue lines with N$_2$H$^+$ is
promising to break the degeneracy between gas mass and CO abundance. The
moderate level of depletion for this source with a cold, but young disk,
suggests that long carbon transformation timescales contribute to the
evolutionary trend seen in the level of carbon depletion among disk
populations, rather than evolving temperature effects and presence of dust
traps alone.

there is a bijection $\phi:E(F)\to [m]$ such that $e\in E(H_{\phi(e)})$ for
each $e\in E(F)$. How large does the minimum degree of each $H_i$ need to be so
that $\textbf{H}$ necessarily contains a copy of $F$ that is a transversal?
Each $H_i$ in the collection could be the same hypergraph, hence the minimum
degree of each $H_i$ needs to be large enough to ensure that $F\subseteq H_i$.
Since its general introduction by Joos and Kim [Bull. Lond. Math. Soc., 2020,
52(3):498-504], a growing body of work has shown that in many cases this lower
bound is tight. In this paper, we give a unified approach to this problem by
providing a widely applicable sufficient condition for this lower bound to be
asymptotically tight. This is general enough to recover many previous results
in the area and obtain novel transversal variants of several classical
Dirac-type results for (powers of) Hamilton cycles. For example, we derive that
any collection of $rn$ graphs on an $n$-vertex set, each with minimum degree at
least $(r/(r+1)+o(1))n$, contains a transversal copy of the $r$-th power of a
Hamilton cycle. This can be viewed as a rainbow version of the P\'osa-Seymour

We avoid to introduce symmetries only useful for addressing the axion quality

supersymmetry, $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ and the discrete R-symmetry $Z_{NR}$. We show
that the interplay among these guarantees the high quality of the axion even
for the gravitino mass and axion decay constant as large as
$m_{3/2}=\mathcal{O}(10){\rm TeV}$ and $F_{a}=\mathcal{O}(10^{15}){\rm GeV}$
respectively. The key point of this work relies on the observation that the
MSSM contribution to the mixed anomalies $Z_{NR}-[SU(2)_{L}]^{2}$ and
$Z_{NR}-[SU(3)_{c}]^{2}$ is not enough for gauging $Z_{NR}$ for $N\neq6$, which
necessitates the introduction of new matter fields. We make the introduction to
achieve zero mixed anomalies, which logically supports a desired large enough
$N$ for $Z_{NR}$. This mechanism effectively makes $Z_{NR}$ equal to $U(1)_{R}$
and thus offers a logically complete solution to the axion quality problem.

materials for catalysis and solid oxide fuel cell applications. Their
functionality often depends on oxygen diffusivity and mobility through complex
oxide heterostructures, which can be significantly impacted by structural and
chemical modifications, such as doping. Further, when utilized within
electrochemical cells, interfacial reactions with other components (e.g. Ni-
and Cr-based alloy electrodes and interconnects) can influence the perovskite's
reactivity and ion transport, leading to complex dependencies that are
difficult to control in real-world environments. Here we use isotopic tracers
and atom probe tomography to directly visualize oxygen diffusion and transport
pathways across perovskite and metal-perovskite heterostructures, i.e. (Ni-Cr
coated) Sr-doped lanthanum ferrite (LSFO). Annealing in 18O2(g) results in
elemental and isotopic redistributions through oxygen exchange (OE) in the LSFO
while Ni-Cr undergoes oxidation via multiple mechanisms and transport pathways.
Complementary density functional theory (DFT) calculations at experimental
conditions provide rationale for OE reaction mechanisms and reveal a complex
interplay of different thermodynamic and kinetic drivers. Our results shed
light on the fundamental coupling of defects and oxygen transport in an
important class of catalytic materials.

frequencies k/n for all integer phases k. The space U is closed under a
commutative and associative binary operation ${\bf u}_m \odot{\bf u}_n={\bf

Brownian Motions. The longtime behavior of all SBM exhibits a dichotomy between
coexistence and non-coexistence of the two populations depending on the
recurrence and transience of the migration and also in many cases on the
branching rate. The most significant gap in the understanding of the longtime
behavior of SBM is for positive correlations in the transient regime. In this
article we give a precise description of the longtime behavior of the SBM with
$\rho=1$ with not necessarily identical initial conditions.

to the Schwarzschild case, converge very quickly to the asymptotic formulas
previously obtained by analytic monodromy techniques. In addition, we find a

  Contrast and Complementarity","10 pages, 5 figures",,,,"hep-lat hep-ph nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although equivalent in the infinite-momentum limit, large-momentum effective
theory (LaMET) and short-distance operator product expansion (SD-OPE) are two
different approaches to extract parton distribution functions (PDFs) from
coordinate-space correlation functions in large-momentum hadrons. LaMET
implements a momentum-space expansion in $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/[x(1-x)P^z]$ to
directly calculate PDFs $f(x)$ in a middle region of Bjorken $x\in [x_{\rm
min}\sim \Lambda_{\rm QCD}/P^z, x_{\rm max}\sim 1-x_{\min}]$. SD-OPE applies
perturbative QCD at small Euclidean distances $z$ to extract a range
$[0,\lambda_{\rm max}]$ of leading-twist correlations, $h(\lambda=zP^z)$,
corresponding to the Fourier transformation of PDFs. Similar to the quantum
mechanical uncertainty principle, an incomplete leading-twist correlation
cannot be readily converted to a momentum-space local distribution, and the
methods to solve the ``inverse problem'' involve essentially modelling of the
missing information beyond $\lambda_{\rm max}$. On the other hand,
short-distance correlations, along with the expected end-point asymptotics, can
be used to phenomenologically fit the PDFs in the LaMET-complementary regions:
$x\in [0,x_{\rm min}]$ and $[x_{\rm max}, 1]$. We use the recent results of the
pion valence quark distribution from the ANL/BNL collaboration to demonstrate
this point.

discovery of the ferromagnetic long-range order in the Tb-based QC. The
difficulty in past theoretical studies on the QC was lack of the microscopic
theory of the crystalline electric field (CEF), which is crucially important in
the rare-earth systems. By analyzing the CEF in the Tb-based QC, we clarify
that magnetic anisotropy plays a key role in realizing unique magnetic textures
in the Tb-based QC and approximant crystal (AC). By constructing the minimal
model, we show that various magnetic textures on the icosahedron at whose
vertices Tb atoms are located. We find that the hedgehog state is characterized
by the topological charge of one and the whirling-moment state is characterized
by unusually large topological charge of three. The hedgehog and
whirling-moment states are shown to be realized as antiferromagnetic orders
transcribed as the emergent monopole and antimonopole in the 1/1 AC. We find
that these states exhibit the topological Hall effect under applied magnetic
field accompanied by the topological as well as metamagnetic transition. Our
model and the determined phase diagram are expected to be relevant to the broad
range of the rare-earth based QCs and ACs with strong magnetic anisotropy,

a political conspiracy that started out on social media but turned mainstream,
in part due to public endorsement by influential political figures. Nowadays,
QAnon conspiracies often appear in the news, are part of political rhetoric,
and are espoused by significant swaths of people in the United States. It is
therefore crucial to understand how such a conspiracy took root online, and
what led so many social media users to adopt its ideas. In this work, we
propose a framework that exploits both social interaction and content signals
to uncover evidence of user radicalization or support for QAnon. Leveraging a
large dataset of 240M tweets collected in the run-up to the 2020 US
Presidential election, we define and validate a multivariate metric of
radicalization. We use that to separate users in distinct, naturally-emerging,
classes of behaviors associated to radicalization processes, from self-declared
QAnon supporters to hyper-active conspiracy promoters. We also analyze the
impact of Twitter's moderation policies on the interactions among different
classes: we discover aspects of moderation that succeed, yielding a substantial
reduction in the endorsement received by hyper-active QAnon accounts. But we
also uncover where moderation fails, showing how QAnon content amplifiers are
not deterred or affected by Twitter intervention. Our findings refine our
understanding of online radicalization processes, reveal effective and
ineffective aspects of moderation, and call for the need to further investigate
the role social media play in the spread of conspiracies.

directly using the neighboring agents' information as observation generally
outperforms the more widely used raycasting. Similarly, using nonholonomic

than holonomic controls with absolute observations. Each of these choices has a
significant, and potentially nontrivial impact on the results, and so

supernova feedback. This likely helps regulate star formation inside of

supernova-driven galactic winds and explore the contributions of different
phases of galaxy evolution to cosmic metal enrichment in the high-redshift (z >
6) Universe. We show that models calibrated to the observed galaxy luminosity
function at z~6-8 have filling factors ~1% at z~6 and ~0.1% at z~12, with
different star formation prescriptions providing about an order of magnitude
uncertainty. Despite the small fraction of space filled by winds, these
scenarios predict an upper limit to the abundance of metal-line absorbers in
quasar spectra at z>5 which is comfortably above that currently observed. We
also consider enrichment through winds driven by Pop III star formation in
minihalos. We find that these can dominate the total filling factor at z>10 and
even compete with winds from normal galaxies at z~6, at least in terms of the
total enriched volume. But these regions have much lower overall metallicities,
because each one is generated by a small burst of star formation. Finally, we
show that Compton cooling of these supernova-driven winds at z>6 has only a
small effect on the cosmic microwave background.

bending rigidity increases, while the in-plane elastic constants reduce with
universal power law exponents. For sheets under uniaxial tension,

differently along the axis of uni-axial stress and orthogonal to it. The
bending rigidities on the other hand will not exhibit any anomalous behavior

approaches where optics are not merely observed, but built with their internal
setups in mind. We identify operational differences between denotationally
isomorphic categories of cartesian optics and lenses: their different
composition rule and corresponding space-time tradeoffs, positioning them at
two opposite ends of a spectrum. With these motivations we lift the existing
categorical constructions and their relationships to the 2-categorical level,
showing that the relevant operational concerns become visible. We define the
2-category $\textbf{2-Optic}(\mathcal{C})$ whose 2-cells explicitly track
optics' internal configuration. We show that the 1-category
$\textbf{Optic}(\mathcal{C})$ arises by locally quotienting out the connected
components of this 2-category. We show that the embedding of lenses into
cartesian optics gets weakened from a functor to an oplax functor whose
oplaxator now detects the different composition rule. We determine the
difficulties in showing this functor forms a part of an adjunction in any of
the standard 2-categories. We establish a conjecture that the well-known
isomorphism between cartesian lenses and optics arises out of the lax
2-adjunction between their double-categorical counterparts. In addition to
presenting new research, this paper is also meant to be an accessible

warping. Nonetheless, those methods heavily suffer from the ghosting effect. On
the other hand, some of kernel-based VFI methods that only use frames as input,
have shown that deformable convolutions, when backed up with transformers, can

event-based video frame interpolation with attention (E-VFIA), as a lightweight

explainable AI (XAI) practices. Machine learning (ML) is increasingly important
in financial services, such as pre-approval, credit underwriting, investments,
and various front-end and back-end activities. Machine Learning can
automatically detect non-linearities and interactions in training data,
facilitating faster and more accurate credit decisions. However, machine
learning models are opaque and hard to explain, which are critical elements
needed for establishing a reliable technology. The study compares various
machine learning models, including single classifiers (logistic regression,
decision trees, LDA, QDA), heterogeneous ensembles (AdaBoost, Random Forest),
and sequential neural networks. The results indicate that ensemble classifiers
and neural networks outperform. In addition, two advanced post-hoc model
agnostic explainability techniques - LIME and SHAP are utilized to assess
ML-based credit scoring models using the open-access datasets offered by
US-based P2P Lending Platform, Lending Club. For this study, we are also using
machine learning algorithms to develop new investment models and explore
portfolio strategies that can maximize profitability while minimizing risk.

considerations of ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal droplets coexisting with
the isotropic melt. We find that the droplets have flat pancake-like shapes
that are thinner than the sample thickness as long as there is a room to
increase the lateral droplet size. In the center of the droplets a wing shaped
defect with low birefringence is present that moves perpendicular to a weak
in-plane electric field, and then extends and splits in two at higher fields.
Parallel to the defect motion and extension, the entire droplet drifts along
the electric field with speed that is independent of the size of the droplet
and is proportional to the amplitude of the electric field. After the field is
increased above 1V/mm the entire droplet gets deformed and oscillates with the
field. These observations led us to determine the polarization field and
revealed the presence of a pair of positive and negative bound electric charge
due to divergences of polarization around the defect volume.

as a possible scenario for the production of electromagnetic radiation, we
compute the two-gluon one-photon vertex in the presence of an intense magnetic
field at one-loop order. The quarks in the loop are taken such that two of them
occupy the lowest Landau level, with the third one occupying the first exited
Landau level. When the field strength is the largest of the energy (squared)
scales, the tensor basis describing this vertex corresponds to two of the three
vector particles polarized in the longitudinal direction whereas the third one
is polarized in the transverse direction. However, when the photon energy is of
order or larger than the field strength, the explicit one-loop computation
contains extra tensor structures that spoil the properties of the basis,
compared to the case when the field strength is the largest of the energy
scales, which signals that the calculation is incomplete. Nevertheless, by
projecting the result onto the would-be basis, we show that the squared
amplitude for processes involving two gluons and one photon exhibits the
expected properties such as a preferred in-plane photon emission and a slightly
decreasing strength for an increasing magnetic field strength. We comment on
possible venues to improve the one-loop calculation that include accounting for
progressive occupation of the three quarks of the lowest and first excited
Landau levels such that, still working in the large field limit, a more
complete description can be achieved when the photon energy increases.

the dependence of LG kinematics on the simulation box size to argue that
cosmological simulations need a box size on the order of 1 Gpc in order to

certain computational problems. Yet, many existing quantum algorithms with
notable asymptotic speedups require a degree of fault tolerance that is
currently unavailable. The quantum algorithm for topological data analysis
(TDA) by Lloyd et al. is believed to be one such algorithm. TDA is a powerful
technique for extracting complex and valuable shape-related summaries of
high-dimensional data. However, the computational demands of classical TDA
algorithms are exorbitant, and become impractical for high-order
characteristics. In this paper, we present NISQ-TDA, the first fully
implemented end-to-end quantum machine learning algorithm needing only a short
circuit-depth, that is applicable to non-handcrafted high-dimensional classical
data, and with provable asymptotic speedup for certain classes of problems. The
algorithm neither suffers from the data-loading problem nor does it need to
store the input data on the quantum computer explicitly. Our approach includes
three key innovations: an efficient realization of the full boundary operator;
a quantum rejection sampling and projection approach to restrict a quantum
state to the simplices of the desired order in the given complex; and a
stochastic rank estimation method to estimate the topological features in the
form of approximate Betti numbers. We present theoretical results that
establish additive error guarantees, along with computational cost and
circuit-depth complexities for normalized output estimates, up to the error
tolerance. The algorithm was successfully executed on quantum computing
devices, as well as on noisy quantum simulators, applied to small datasets.
Preliminary empirical results suggest that the algorithm is robust to noise.
Finally, we provide target depths and noise level estimates to realize
near-term, non-fault-tolerant quantum advantage.

cardinality of any set $S$ of vertices on which repeated applications of the
forcing rule results in all vertices being in $S$. The forcing rule is: if a
vertex $v$ is in $S$, and exactly one neighbor $u$ of $v$ is not in $S$, then
$u$ is added to $S$ in the next iteration. Hence the failed zero forcing number
of a graph was defined to be the size of the largest set of vertices which
fails to force all vertices in the graph. A similar property called skew zero
forcing was defined so that if there is exactly one neighbor $u$ of $v$ is not
in $S$, then $u$ is added to $S$ in the next iteration. The difference is that
vertices that are not in $S$ can force other vertices. This leads to the failed
skew zero forcing number of a graph, which is denoted by $F^{-}(G)$. In this

with an average, maximum Do$\delta$ of 72$\%$. Compared to $\beta$-spots,
$\delta$-spots have 2.6$\times$ the maximum umbral flux, 1.9$\times$ the flux
emergence rate, 2.6$\times$ the rotation, and 72$\times$ the flare energy. On
average, the magnetic knots rotate 17$^{\circ}$ day$^{-1}$ while the

84$\%$ of the $\delta$-spots are formed by single flux emergence events and

big challenge for both students and lecturers. A novel chemical structure
teaching (CST) method was developed based on our long-term teaching experience
to cope with these challenges. It has been shown in practice that this CST
method can significantly unload the stress of students and lecturers
simultaneously. The survey about the improvement of students' interests was
carried out and listed in the form of questionnaire. The outcome of CST also
indicates that it can help them to form abilities of critical and logical
thinking as independent learners, motivate them to discuss with their peers and
lecturers, and eventually improve average grades. Furthermore, CST can be
beneficial for lecturers who instruct other relevant curriculum in chemical or
pharmaceutical engineering to improve the teaching outcome, such as organic
chemistry, spectrum analysis, pharmaceutical synthesis and medicinal chemistry.
This CST model can also help students cultivate lifelong learning ability as
active learners and habit from the cognitive perspective view.

associated with distributed representations. Furthermore, we argue that the
vocabulary of discrete substructure patterns induced over drug sets is not
dramatically large due to the limited set of atom types and constraints on
bonding patterns enforced by chemistry. Under this pretext, we explore the
effectiveness of distributed representations of the molecular graphs of drugs
in drug pair scoring tasks such as drug synergy, polypharmacy, and drug-drug
interaction prediction. To achieve this, we present a methodology for learning
and incorporating distributed representations of graphs within a unified
framework for drug pair scoring. Subsequently, we augment a number of recent
and state-of-the-art models to utilise our embeddings. We empirically show that
the incorporation of these embeddings improves downstream performance of almost
every model across different drug pair scoring tasks, even those the original

segmentation are usually implemented in specialized networks with distinctive
architectures that are difficult to adapt to each other. This paper presents
LidarMultiNet, a LiDAR-based multi-task network that unifies these three major
LiDAR perception tasks. Among its many benefits, a multi-task network can
reduce the overall cost by sharing weights and computation among multiple
tasks. However, it typically underperforms compared to independently combined
single-task models. The proposed LidarMultiNet aims to bridge the performance
gap between the multi-task network and multiple single-task networks. At the
core of LidarMultiNet is a strong 3D voxel-based encoder-decoder architecture
with a Global Context Pooling (GCP) module extracting global contextual
features from a LiDAR frame. Task-specific heads are added on top of the
network to perform the three LiDAR perception tasks. More tasks can be
implemented simply by adding new task-specific heads while introducing little
additional cost. A second stage is also proposed to refine the first-stage
segmentation and generate accurate panoptic segmentation results. LidarMultiNet
is extensively tested on both Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes dataset,
demonstrating for the first time that major LiDAR perception tasks can be
unified in a single strong network that is trained end-to-end and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Notably, LidarMultiNet reaches the official 1st
place in the Waymo Open Dataset 3D semantic segmentation challenge 2022 with
the highest mIoU and the best accuracy for most of the 22 classes on the test
set, using only LiDAR points as input. It also sets the new state-of-the-art
for a single model on the Waymo 3D object detection benchmark and three
nuScenes benchmarks.

factor-as-piece approximation that divides the linear-chain graph structure
into the set of pieces, which preserves the basic Markov Random Field structure

the model to address different contributions of candidate labels, which enables
the ground-truth label information to be utilized in parameter learning. Based
on the derived lower bound of the variational lower bound of the proposed
model, variational parameters and confidence measures are estimated in the
framework of alternating optimization. Moreover, weighted Viterbi algorithm is
proposed to incorporate confidence measure to sequence prediction, which
considers label ambiguity arose from multiple annotations in the training data

Recent studies show two striking features of this region: 1) a very large
population of objects in distant mean-motion resonances with Neptune, and 2)
the existence of a substantial detached population (non-resonant objects
largely decoupled from Neptune). Neptune migration models are able to implant
some resonant and detached objects during the planet migration era, but many
fail to match a variety of aspects of the orbital distribution. In this work,
we report simulations carried out using an improved version of the GPU-based
code GLISSE, following 100,000 test particles per simulation in parallel while
handling their planetary close encounters. We demonstrate for the first time
that a 2 Earth-mass rogue planet temporarily present during planet formation
can abundantly populate both the distant resonances and the detached
populations, surprisingly even without planetary migration. We show how weak
encounters with the rogue greatly increase the efficiency of filling the
resonances, while also dislodging TNOs out of resonance once they reach high
perihelia. The rogue's secular gravitational influence simultaneously generates
numerous detached objects observed at all semimajor axes. These results suggest
that the early presence of additional planet(s) reproduces the observed TNO
orbital structure in the distant Kuiper Belt.

sequence-to-sequence models, enabling free-form generation and larger label
search space; (2) We propose label sequences -- phrases with indefinite lengths
to verbalize the labels -- which eliminate the need of manual templates and are
more expressive than single label words; (3) We use beam search to
automatically generate a large amount of label sequence candidates and propose
contrastive re-ranking to get the best combinations. AutoSeq significantly
outperforms other no-manual-design methods, such as soft prompt tuning, adapter
tuning, and automatic search on single label words; the generated label
sequences are even better than curated manual ones on a variety of tasks. Our
method reveals the potential of sequence-to-sequence models in few-shot
learning and sheds light on a path to generic and automatic prompting. The

  Asteroseismology in the Era of Space Missions"" (eds. J. Pascual Granado, T.
  Campante, A. Garc\'ia Hern\'andez, Z. Guo)",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Asteroseismology has opened a window on the internal physics of thousands of
stars, by relating oscillation spectra properties to the internal physics of
stars. Mode identification, namely the process of associating a measured
oscillation frequency to the corresponding mode geometry and properties, is the
cornerstone of this analysis of seismic spectra. In rapidly rotating stars this
identification is a challenging task that remains incomplete, as modes assume
complex geometries and regular patterns in frequencies get scrambled under the
influence of the Coriolis force and centrifugal flattening.
  In this article, I will first discuss the various classes of mode geometries
that emerge in rapidly-rotating stars and the related frequency and period
patterns, as predicted by ray dynamics, complete (non-)adiabatic calculations,
or using the traditional approximation of rotation. These patterns scale with
structural quantities and help us derive crucial constraints on the structure
and evolution of these stars. I will summarize the amazing progress
accomplished over the last few years for the deciphering of gravity-mode
pulsator oscillation spectra, and recent developments based on machine-learning
classification techniques to distinguish oscillation modes and pattern analysis
strategies that let us access the underlying physics of pressure-mode
pulsators. These approaches pave the way to ensemble asteroseismology of
classical pulsators.
  Finally, I will highlight how these recent progress can be combined to
improve forward seismic modelling. I will focus on the example of Rasalhague, a
well-known rapid rotator, to illustrate the process and the needed advances to
obtain \`a-la-carte modelling of such stars.

the coiling ratio tends to infinity: the gradient will diverge in opposing
directions depending on whether the radius is less than or greater than
$\frac{1}{2}$.
  We conclude by discussing the implications to the more general
M\""obius-Plateau energy, where the energy of a curve, or pair of curves,
includes the area of the minimal surface bounded by them. Symmetric helix pairs
bound a helicoid between them, and applying our result shows that stationary

optimization model that explicitly considers a sampled subset of followers and
exploits a machine learning model to estimate the objective values of unsampled
followers. Unlike existing approaches, we embed machine learning model training
into the optimization problem, which allows us to employ general follower
features that can not be represented using leader decisions. We prove bounds on
the optimality gap of the generated leader decision as measured by the original
objective function that considers the full follower set. We then develop
follower sampling algorithms to tighten the bounds and a representation
learning approach to learn follower features, which can be used as inputs to
the embedded machine learning model. Using synthetic instances of a cycling
network design problem, we compare the computational performance of our
approach versus baseline methods. Our approach provides more accurate
predictions for follower objective values, and more importantly, generates
leader decisions of higher quality. Finally, we perform a real-world case study
on cycling infrastructure planning, where we apply our approach to solve a
network design problem with over one million followers. Our approach presents
favorable performance compared to the current cycling network expansion

DetCLIP, a paralleled visual-concept pre-training method for open-world

explicitly build the relationships among various concepts to facilitate the

provide sufficient negative concepts for the construction of the word-region

accelerate each iteration of optimization. The experimental results on several

the problem is that the time spent to reproduce space weathering in these

December 2010, the T-type asteroid 596 Scheila underwent a collision with a
few-tens-of-meters impactor. A decade later, there is an opportunity to study
how the surface layer of this asteroid is being altered by space weathering
after the impact. To do so, we performed visible spectrophotometric and
near-infrared spectroscopic observations of 596 Scheila. The acquired spectrum
is consistent with those observed shortly after the 2010 impact event within
the observational uncertainty range. This indicates that the surface color of
dark asteroids is not noticeably changed by space weathering over a 10-year
period. This study is the first to investigate color changes due to space
weathering on an actual asteroid surface in the Solar System. Considering that
fresh layers are regularly created on asteroid surfaces by collisions, we

Compression (NVC). First, we reveal a fundamental relationship between bit
allocation in NVC and Semi-Amortized Variational Inference (SAVI).
Specifically, we show that SAVI with GoP (Group-of-Picture)-level likelihood is
equivalent to pixel-level bit allocation with precise rate \& quality
dependency model. Based on this equivalence, we establish a new paradigm of bit
allocation using SAVI. Different from previous bit allocation methods, our
approach requires no empirical model and is thus optimal. Moreover, as the
original SAVI using gradient ascent only applies to single-level latent, we
extend the SAVI to multi-level such as NVC by recursively applying
back-propagating through gradient ascent. Finally, we propose a tractable
approximation for practical implementation. Our method can be applied to
scenarios where performance outweights encoding speed, and serves as an
empirical bound on the R-D performance of bit allocation. Experimental results
show that current state-of-the-art bit allocation algorithms still have a room
of $\approx 0.5$ dB PSNR to improve compared with ours. Code is available at

two important desiderata required of modern machine learning models. While
these two desiderata seem related, the connection between them is often unclear
in practice. Here, we discuss these connections through a causal lens, focusing
on anti-causal prediction tasks, where the input to a classifier (e.g., an
image) is assumed to be generated as a function of the target label and the
protected attribute. By taking this perspective, we draw explicit connections
between a common fairness criterion - separation - and a common notion of
robustness - risk invariance. These connections provide new motivation for
applying the separation criterion in anticausal settings, and inform old
discussions regarding fairness-performance tradeoffs. In addition, our findings
suggest that robustness-motivated approaches can be used to enforce separation,
and that they often work better in practice than methods designed to directly
enforce separation. Using a medical dataset, we empirically validate our
findings on the task of detecting pneumonia from X-rays, in a setting where
differences in prevalence across sex groups motivates a fairness mitigation.
Our findings highlight the importance of considering causal structure when
choosing and enforcing fairness criteria.

privacy and security concerns. To mitigate these issues, secure multi-party

computation. In practice, they often come at very high computation and
communication overhead, and potentially prohibit their popularity in large
scale systems. Two orthogonal research trends have attracted enormous interests
in addressing the energy efficiency in secure deep learning, i.e., overhead
reduction of MPC comparison protocol, and hardware acceleration. However, they
either achieve a low reduction ratio and suffer from high latency due to
limited computation and communication saving, or are power-hungry as existing
works mainly focus on general computing platforms such as CPUs and GPUs.
  In this work, as the first attempt, we develop a systematic framework,
PolyMPCNet, of joint overhead reduction of MPC comparison protocol and hardware
acceleration, by integrating hardware latency of the cryptographic building
block into the DNN loss function to achieve high energy efficiency, accuracy,
and security guarantee. Instead of heuristically checking the model sensitivity
after a DNN is well-trained (through deleting or dropping some non-polynomial
operators), our key design principle is to em enforce exactly what is assumed
in the DNN design -- training a DNN that is both hardware efficient and secure,
while escaping the local minima and saddle points and maintaining high
accuracy. More specifically, we propose a straight through polynomial
activation initialization method for cryptographic hardware friendly trainable
polynomial activation function to replace the expensive 2P-ReLU operator. We
develop a cryptographic hardware scheduler and the corresponding performance

from Okayama Planet Search Program, a precise radial velocity survey,
undertaken at Okayama Astrophysical Observatory between 2004 April and 2021
June. The star is K0 type and located at beginning of the red-giant branch. It
has a mass of $1.35_{-0.21}^{+0.19} M_{\odot}$, a radius of
$4.86_{-0.49}^{+0.55} R_{\odot}$, and a surface gravity $\log g$ of
$3.18_{-0.07}^{+0.08}$. The planetary system is composed of three giant planets
in a compact configuration: The planets have minimum masses of $M_{\rm{b}}\sin
i = 0.31_{-0.04}^{+0.03} M_{\rm{J}}$, $M_{\rm{c}}\sin i = 0.30_{-0.05}^{+0.04}
M_{\rm{J}}$, and $M_{\rm{d}}\sin i = 0.45_{-0.06}^{+0.04} M_{\rm{J}}$, and

three sets of radial velocity data. The ratio of orbital periods are close to
$P_{\rm{d}}:P_{\rm{c}}:P_{\rm{b}} \sim 21:12:7$, which means the period ratios
between neighboring planets are both lower than $2:1$. The dynamical stability
analysis reveals that the planets should have near-circular orbits. The system
could remain stable over 1 Gyr, initialized from co-planar orbits, low
eccentricities ($e=0.05$), and planet masses equal to the minimum mass derived
from the best-fit circular orbit fitting. Besides, the planets are not likely
in mean motion resonance. HD 184010 system is unique: it is the first system
discovered to have a highly evolved star ($\log g < 3.5$ cgs) and more than two
giant planets all with intermediate orbital periods ($10^2\ \rm{d} < P < 10^3\
\rm{d}$).

relies on the expertise level of annotators in capturing internal dependencies
for each token in the sequence. In this paper, we propose Modeling sequential

probabilistic model is developed to jointly model sequential data and
annotators' expertise, in which categorical distribution is introduced to
estimate the reliability of each annotator in capturing local and non-local

of the proposed model, a valid label sequence inference (VLSE) method is
proposed to derive the valid ground-truth label sequences from crowd sequential
annotations. VLSE derives possible ground-truth labels from the token-wise
level and further prunes sub-paths in the forward inference for label sequence
decoding. VLSE reduces the number of candidate label sequences and improves the
quality of possible ground-truth label sequences. The experimental results on
several sequence labeling tasks of Natural Language Processing show the
effectiveness of the proposed model.

encoders can be improved by training with multi-modal multi-task losses, using
unpaired examples from another modality (e.g., sentences and unrelated

our framework on unpaired non-linguistic data makes it language-agnostic,
enabling it to be widely applicable beyond English NLP. Experiments on 7
semantic textual similarity benchmarks reveal that models trained with the
additional non-linguistic (images/audio) contrastive objective lead to higher

In this work, we lift the limitation of the magnon topology control on the bulk
non-electronic manipulation by proposing a scheme to manipulate magnonic
topological phases by electronic boundary operations of spin chirality
injection. More specifically, we consider a ferromagnetic honeycomb lattice and
show that a finite spin chirality injected from the boundary of the system via
the spin Hall effects introduces a tunable sublattice-symmetry-breaking mass
term to the bosonic counterpart of the Haldane model for the Chern insulators
and thereby allows us to electronically manipulate the bulk topology of magnons
from the boundary. The ""shoulder"" in the thermal Hall conductivity profile is
proposed as an experimental probe of the chirality-induced topological phase
transition. The scheme for the boundary manipulation of the magnon topology is
shown to work for a honeycomb antiferromagnet as well. We envisage that the
interfacial chirality injection may offer a nonintrusive electronic means to
tune the static and the dynamical bulk properties of general magnetic systems.

hole doping plays a key role in stabilizing the polar phases in binary metal

that holes in these oxides mainly occupy one of the two oxygen sublattices.
This hole localization, which is more pronounced in the polar phase than in the
nonpolar phase, lowers the electrostatic energy of the system, and makes the
polar phase more stable at sufficiently large concentrations. We demonstrate
that this electrostatic mechanism is responsible for stabilization of the
ferroelectric phase of HfO2 aliovalently doped with elements that introduce
holes to the system, such as La and N. Finally, we show that the spontaneous

can improve generalization. To this end, we propose locally constrained
representations, where an auxiliary loss forces the state representations to be
predictable by the representations of the neighbouring states. This encourages
the representations to be driven not only by the value/policy learning but also
self-supervised learning, which constrains the representations from changing
too rapidly. We evaluate the proposed method on several known benchmarks and
observe strong performance. Especially in continuous control tasks, our
experiments show a significant advantage over a strong baseline.

Magnetic topological insulators are promising candidates due to their tunable
magnetic order by electrical currents with high energy efficiency. Here, we
utilize magnetic topological insulators as memristors (termed magnetic
topological memristors) and introduce a chiral edge state-based cryogenic
in-memory computing scheme. On the one hand, the chiral edge state can be tuned
from left-handed to right-handed chirality through spin-momentum locked
topological surface current injection. On the other hand, the chiral edge state
exhibits giant and bipolar anomalous Hall resistance, which facilitates the
electrical readout. The memristive switching and reading of the chiral edge
state exhibit high energy efficiency, high stability, and low stochasticity. We
achieve high accuracy in a proof-of-concept classification task using four
magnetic topological memristors. Furthermore, our algorithm-level and
circuit-level simulations of large-scale neural networks based on magnetic
topological memristors demonstrate a software-level accuracy and lower energy

existing memristor technologies. Our results may inspire further topological

level of performance that -- though possibly suboptimal -- should be
maintained. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that rely on extensive
exploration of the state and action space can be used to optimize a control
policy. However, fully exploratory RL algorithms may decrease performance below
a baseline level during training. In this paper, we address the issue of online
optimization of a control policy while minimizing regret w.r.t a baseline
policy performance. We present a joint imitation-reinforcement learning
framework, denoted JIRL. The learning process in JIRL assumes the availability
of a baseline policy and is designed with two objectives in mind \textbf{(a)}
leveraging the baseline's online demonstrations to minimize the regret w.r.t
the baseline policy during training, and \textbf{(b)} eventually surpassing the
baseline performance. JIRL addresses these objectives by initially learning to
imitate the baseline policy and gradually shifting control from the baseline to
an RL agent. Experimental results show that JIRL effectively accomplishes the
aforementioned objectives in several, continuous action-space domains. The
results demonstrate that JIRL is comparable to a state-of-the-art algorithm in
its final performance while incurring significantly lower baseline regret
during training in all of the presented domains. Moreover, the results show a
reduction factor of up to $21$ in baseline regret over a state-of-the-art

homogenous across different cities and communities, and various heterogeneous
features can influence the spread trajectories. Hence, for predictive pandemic
monitoring, it is essential to explore latent heterogeneous features in cities
and communities that distinguish their specific pandemic spread trajectories.
To this end, this study creates a network embedding model capturing
cross-county visitation networks, as well as heterogeneous features to uncover
clusters of counties in the United States based on their pandemic spread
transmission trajectories. We collected and computed location intelligence
features from 2,787 counties from March 3 to June 29, 2020 (initial wave).
Second, we constructed a human visitation network, which incorporated county
features as node attributes, and visits between counties as network edges. Our
attributed network embeddings approach integrates both typological
characteristics of the cross-county visitation network, as well as
heterogeneous features. We conducted clustering analysis on the attributed
network embeddings to reveal four archetypes of spread risk trajectories
corresponding to four clusters of counties. Subsequently, we identified four
features as important features underlying the distinctive transmission risk
patterns among the archetypes. The attributed network embedding approach and
the findings identify and explain the non-homogenous pandemic risk trajectories
across counties for predictive pandemic monitoring. The study also contributes
to data-driven and deep learning-based approaches for pandemic analytics to
complement the standard epidemiological models for policy analysis in

introduces a model predictive control scheme, where a neural network constantly
updates the cost function of a quadratic program based on sensory inputs,
aiming to minimize a general non-convex task loss without solving a non-convex
problem online. By updating the cost, the robot is able to adapt to changes in
the environment directly from sensor measurement without requiring a new cost
design. Furthermore, since the quadratic program can be solved efficiently with
hard constraints, a safe deployment on the robot is ensured. Experiments with a
wide variety of reaching tasks on an industrial robot manipulator demonstrate
that our method can efficiently solve complex non-convex problems with
high-dimensional visual sensory inputs, while still being robust to external

EEG signals is challenging owing to the following issues: 1) sleep-related EEG
patterns occur on different temporal and frequency scales and 2) sleep stages
share similar EEG patterns. To address these issues, we propose a deep learning

supervised contrastive learning for automatic sleep scoring. For the feature
pyramid, we propose a backbone network named SleePyCo-backbone to consider
multiple feature sequences on different temporal and frequency scales.
Supervised contrastive learning allows the network to extract class
discriminative features by minimizing the distance between intra-class features
and simultaneously maximizing that between inter-class features. Comparative

models are roughly a dozen parameters with a realistic one requiring more than
100. Realistic radiative transfer models require tens of CPU minutes for a
single evaluation making the problem computationally intractable with
traditional means requiring millions of MCMC samples for such a problem. A new
method for accelerating simulations known as surrogate models or emulators

to understand progenitors/explosions from spectral time series. There exist
emulators for the TARDIS supernova radiative transfer code but they only
perform well on simplistic low-dimensional models (roughly a dozen parameters)

radial velocity precisions. One shortcoming is the highly variable brightness
of the comb lines across the spectrum (up to 4-5 orders of magnitude). This can
result in some lines saturating while others are at low signal and lost in the
noise. Losing lines to either of these effects reduces the precision and hence
effectiveness of the comb. In addition, the brightness of the comb lines can
vary with time which could drive comb lines with initially reasonable SNR's
into the two regimes described above. To mitigate these two effects, laser
frequency combs use optical flattener's.
  Flattener's are typically bulk optic setups that disperse the comb light with
a grating, and then use a spatial light modulator to control the amplitude
across the spectrum before recombining the light into another single mode fiber
and sending it to the spectrograph. These setups can be large (small bench
top), expensive (several hundred thousand dollars) and have limited stability.
To address these issues, we have developed an all-photonic spectrum flattener
on a chip. The device is constructed from optical waveguides on a SiN chip. The
light from the laser frequency comb's output optical fiber can be directly
connected to the chip, where the light is first dispersed using an arrayed
waveguide grating. To control the brightness of each channel, the light is
passed through a Mach-Zehnder interferometer before being recombined with a
second arrayed waveguide grating. Thermo-optic phase modulators are used in
each channel before recombination to path length match the channels as needed.

propose Rowan, an efficient RDMA abstraction to handle replication writes in PM
KVSs; it aggregates concurrent remote writes from different servers, and lands
these writes to PM in a sequential (thus low DLWA) and one-sided (thus low
latency) manner. We realize Rowan with off-the-shelf RDMA NICs. Further, we

in the hot accretion flows around black holes. Most of those studies focus only
on the region close to the central black hole, therefore it is unclear whether
the wind production stops at large radii around Bondi radius. Bu et al. 2016
studied the hot accretion flow around the Bondi radius in the presence of
nuclear star gravity. They find that when the nuclear stars gravity is
important/comparable to the black hole gravity, winds can not be produced
around the Bondi radius. However, for some galaxies, the nuclear stars gravity
around Bondi radius may not be strong. In this case, whether winds can be
produced around Bondi radius is not clear. We study the hot accretion flow
around Bondi radius with and without thermal conduction by performing
hydrodynamical simulations. We use the virtual particles trajectory method to
study whether winds exist based on the simulation data. Our numerical results
show that in the absence of nuclear stars gravity, winds can be produced around
Bondi radius, which causes the mass inflow rate decreasing inwards. We confirm
the results of Yuan et al. which indicates this is due to the mass loss of gas
via wind rather convectional motions.

topic into a description of four key elements. (1) We start by describing THz
spectroscopy of spin excitations for probing magnetic phase transitions in
thermal equilibrium. While acoustic magnons are useful indicators of spin
reorientation transitions, electromagnons that arise from dynamic
magnetoelectric couplings serve as a signature of inversion-symmetry-breaking
phases at low temperatures. (2) We then review the strong laser driving
scenario, where the system is excited far from equilibrium and thereby subject
to modifications to the free energy landscape. Microscopic pathways for
ultrafast laser manipulation of magnetic order are discussed. (3) Furthermore,
we review a variety of protocols to manipulate coherent THz magnons in time and

applications. (4) Finally, new insights on the connection between dynamic

science. In such teaching activities, tool support can be highly beneficial.
While there are already several tools for assisting with development of the
front end of compilers, tool support tapers off towards the back end, or
requires more background experience than is expected of undergraduate students.
  Structural operational semantics is a useful and mathematically simple
formalism for specifying the behaviour of programs and a specification lends
itself well to implementation; in particular big-step or natural semantics is
often a useful and simple approach. However, many students struggle with
learning the notation and often come up with ill-defined and meaningless
attempts at defining a structural operational semantics. A survey shows that
students working on programming language projects feel that tool support is
lacking and would be useful.
  Many of these problems encountered when developing a semantic definition are
similar to problems encountered in programming, in particular ones that are
essentially the result of type errors.
  We present a pedagogical metalanguage based on natural semantics, and its
implementation, as an attempt to marry two notions: a syntax similar to
textbook notation for natural semantics on the one hand, and automatic
verification of some correctness properties on the other by means of a strong
type discipline. The metalanguage and the tool provide the facilities for
writing and executing specifications as a form of programming. The user can
check that the specification is not meaningless as well as execute programs, if
the specification makes sense.

security of consistency maintenance protocols usually have been established for
the ideal setting only, it is vital to show that these properties carry over to

simplification is that we consider only a concrete pair of network topologies,

corresponding model checking problem is to determine whether such a winning

following such strategies does not necessarily involve an optimal use of

truth assignment that maximises the number of satisfied clauses of the encoding
a cost-optimal winning strategy as well as a cost-optimal system can be

sparsity to enable cost-effective continual learning on edge devices. SparCL
achieves both training acceleration and accuracy preservation through the
synergy of three aspects: weight sparsity, data efficiency, and gradient
sparsity. Specifically, we propose task-aware dynamic masking (TDM) to learn a
sparse network throughout the entire CL process, dynamic data removal (DDR) to
remove less informative training data, and dynamic gradient masking (DGM) to
sparsify the gradient updates. Each of them not only improves efficiency, but
also further mitigates catastrophic forgetting. SparCL consistently improves
the training efficiency of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) CL methods by at
most 23X less training FLOPs, and, surprisingly, further improves the SOTA
accuracy by at most 1.7%. SparCL also outperforms competitive baselines

governing equations, the time discretisation is tantamount to achieving an
accurate numerical method. To this end, the EP system is viewed as a
differential algebraic equation system (DAEs) via the method of lines. As a
consequence of this vantage point, high order linearly semi-implicit (SI) time
discretisation are realised by employing a novel combination of the direct
approach used for implicit discretisation of DAEs and, two different classes of
IMEX-RK schemes: the additive and the multiplicative. For both the time
discretisation strategies, in order to account for rapid plasma oscillations in
quasineutral regimes, the nonlinear Euler fluxes are split into two different
combinations of stiff and non-stiff components. The high order scheme resulting
from the additive approach is designated as a classical scheme while the one
generated by the multiplicative approach possesses the asymptotic preserving
(AP) property. Time discretisations for the classical and the AP schemes are
performed by standard IMEX-RK and SI-IMEX-RK methods, respectively so that the
stiff terms are treated implicitly and the non-stiff ones explicitly. In order
to discretise in space a Rusanov-type central flux is used for the non-stiff
part, and simple central differencing for the stiff part. AP property is also
established for the space-time fully-discrete scheme obtained using the
multiplicative approach. Results of numerical experiments are presented, which
confirm that the high order schemes based on the SI-IMEX-RK time discretisation
achieve uniform second order convergence with respect to the Debye length and
are AP in the quasineutral limit.

simultaneously with a team of robots: first, the guidance and navigation of

displacements between robots on the path or surface. Such a desired
displacement is achieved by controlling the virtual coordinates, which
correspond to the path or surface's parameters, between guiding vector fields.
  Rigorous mathematical guarantees underpinned by dynamical systems theory and
Lyapunov theory are provided for the effective distributed motion coordination
and navigation of robots on paths or surfaces from all initial positions. As an
example for practical robotic applications, we derive a control algorithm from
the proposed coordinating guiding vector fields for a Dubins-car-like model

  Our proposed algorithm is distributed and scalable to an arbitrary number of

differentiable blocks/layers with a prediction module connected only to its
last layer. DNNs can be attached with prediction modules at multiple points
along the backbone where inference can stop at an intermediary stage without
passing through all the modules. The last exit point may offer a better
prediction error but also involves more computational resources and latency. An
exit point that is `optimal' in terms of both prediction error and cost is
desirable. The optimal exit point may depend on the latent distribution of the
tasks and may change from one task type to another. During neural inference,
the ground truth of instances may not be available and error rates at each exit
point cannot be estimated. Hence one is faced with the problem of selecting the
optimal exit in an unsupervised setting. Prior works tackled this problem in an
offline supervised setting assuming that enough labeled data is available to
estimate the error rate at each exit point and tune the parameters for better
accuracy. However, pre-trained DNNs are often deployed in new domains for which
a large amount of ground truth may not be available. We model the problem of
exit selection as an unsupervised online learning problem and use bandit theory
to identify the optimal exit point. Specifically, we focus on Elastic BERT, a
pre-trained multi-exit DNN to demonstrate that it `nearly' satisfies the Strong
Dominance (SD) property making it possible to learn the optimal exit in an
online setup without knowing the ground truth labels. We develop upper
confidence bound (UCB) based algorithm named UEE-UCB that provably achieves
sub-linear regret under the SD property. Thus our method provides a means to
adaptively learn domain-specific optimal exit points in multi-exit DNNs. We

characterise all such pairs, and we further generalise this characterisation to

avoid a bounded number of elements of each group. This unifies almost all known

phenomena such as selection and mutation in evolving populations, and the
generation and distribution of wealth within social systems. Population
heterogeneity in stochastic growth rates has been shown to be the critical
driver of diversity dynamics and of the emergence of wealth inequality over
long time scales. However, we still lack a general statistical framework that
systematically explains the origins of these heterogeneities from the
adaptation of agents to their environment. In this paper, we derive population
growth parameters resulting from the interaction between agents and their
knowable environment, conditional on subjective signals each agent receives. We
show that average growth rates converge, under specific conditions, to their
maximal value as the mutual information between the agent's signal and the
environment, and that sequential Bayesian learning is the optimal strategy for
reaching this maximum. It follows that when all agents access the same
environment using the same inference model, the learning process dynamically
attenuates growth rate disparities, reversing the long-term effects of
heterogeneity on inequality. Our approach lays the foundation for a unified
general quantitative modeling of social and biological phenomena such as the
dynamical effects of cooperation, and the effects of education on life history

training perceptron neural networks. Synapse weights are found using Grover's
algorithm with a modified oracle function. The results of running these
parametrically synthesized circuits for training perceptrons of three different
topologies are described. The circuits were run on a 100-qubit IBM quantum
simulator. The synthesis of quantum circuits is carried out using quantum
synthesizer ""Naginata"", which was developed in the scope of this work, the
source code of which is published and further documented on GitHub. The article
describes the quantum circuit synthesis algorithm for training single-layer
perceptrons. At the moment, quantum circuits are created mainly by manually
placing logic elements on lines that symbolize quantum bits. The purpose of
creating Quantum Circuit Synthesizer ""Naginata"" was due to the fact that even
with a slight increase in the number of operations in a quantum algorithm,
leads to the significant increase in size of the corresponding quantum circuit.
This causes serious difficulties both in creating and debugging these quantum
circuits. The purpose of our quantum synthesizer is enabling users an
opportunity to implement quantum algorithms using higher-level commands. This
is achieved by creating generic blocks for frequently used operations such as:
the adder, multiplier, digital comparator (comparison operator), etc. Thus, the
user could implement a quantum algorithm by using these generic blocks, and the
quantum synthesizer would create a suitable circuit for this algorithm, in a
format that is supported by the chosen quantum computation environment. This
approach greatly simplifies the processes of development and debugging a
quantum algorithm.

experience. While positive reviews are beneficial to the stores, negative ones
will largely influence consumers' decision and may lead to a decline in sales.
Therefore, it is of vital importance to carefully and persuasively reply to
each negative review and minimize its disadvantageous effect. Recent studies
consider leveraging generation models to help the sellers respond. However,
this problem is not well-addressed as the reviews may contain multiple aspects
of issues which should be resolved accordingly and persuasively. In this work,
we propose a Multi-Source Multi-Aspect Attentive Generation model for
persuasive response generation. Various sources of information are
appropriately obtained and leveraged by the proposed model for generating more
informative and persuasive responses. A multi-aspect attentive network is
proposed to automatically attend to different aspects in a review and ensure
most of the issues are tackled. Extensive experiments on two real-world
datasets, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods and online tests prove that our deployed system significantly enhances
the efficiency of the stores' dealing with negative reviews.

state-of-the-art results in various image deblurring tasks. However, one major
drawback of deep learning-based deblurring networks is that large amounts of
blurry-clean image pairs are required for training to achieve good performance.
Moreover, deep networks often fail to perform well when the blurry images and
the blur kernels during testing are very different from the ones used during
training. This happens mainly because of the overfitting of the network
parameters on the training data. In this work, we present a method that
addresses these issues. We view the non-blind image deblurring problem as a
denoising problem. To do so, we perform Wiener filtering on a pair of blurry
images with the corresponding blur kernels. This results in a pair of images
with colored noise. Hence, the deblurring problem is translated into a
denoising problem. We then solve the denoising problem without using explicit
clean target images. Extensive experiments are conducted to show that our
method achieves results that are on par to the state-of-the-art non-blind
deblurring works.

that aims to learn a multi-class classifier from only complementary labels,
which indicate a class to which an instance does not belong. Existing
approaches mainly adopt the paradigm of reduction to ordinary classification,
which applies specific transformations and surrogate losses to connect CLL back
to ordinary classification. Those approaches, however, face several
limitations, such as the tendency to overfit or be hooked on deep models. In
this paper, we sidestep those limitations with a novel perspective--reduction
to probability estimates of complementary classes. We prove that accurate
probability estimates of complementary labels lead to good classifiers through
a simple decoding step. The proof establishes a reduction framework from CLL to
probability estimates. The framework offers explanations of several key CLL
approaches as its special cases and allows us to design an improved algorithm
that is more robust in noisy environments. The framework also suggests a
validation procedure based on the quality of probability estimates, leading to
an alternative way to validate models with only complementary labels. The
flexible framework opens a wide range of unexplored opportunities in using deep
and non-deep models for probability estimates to solve the CLL problem.
Empirical experiments further verified the framework's efficacy and robustness

scenes with a single dominant object (e.g., images from ImageNet). On the other
hand, natural scenes include multiple dominant objects that are semantically
related. Thus, it is crucial to explore designing attack strategies that look
beyond learning on single-object scenes or attack single-object victim
classifiers. Due to their inherent property of strong transferability of
perturbations to unknown models, this paper presents the first approach of
using generative models for adversarial attacks on multi-object scenes. In
order to represent the relationships between different objects in the input
scene, we leverage upon the open-sourced pre-trained vision-language model CLIP
(Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), with the motivation to exploit the
encoded semantics in the language space along with the visual space. We call
this attack approach Generative Adversarial Multi-object scene Attacks (GAMA).
GAMA demonstrates the utility of the CLIP model as an attacker's tool to train
formidable perturbation generators for multi-object scenes. Using the joint
image-text features to train the generator, we show that GAMA can craft potent
transferable perturbations in order to fool victim classifiers in various
attack settings. For example, GAMA triggers ~16% more misclassification than
state-of-the-art generative approaches in black-box settings where both the
classifier architecture and data distribution of the attacker are different

electron temperature and density profiles for RCS J2319+0038. This is one of
the first such measurements for an individual cluster at $z \gtrsim 0.9$. We
find that the inner pressure profile of both clusters is much shallower than
that of local cool-core clusters. Our results consistently suggest that RCS
J2319+0038 hosts a weak cool core, where radiative cooling is less significant
than in local cool cores. On the other hand, HSC J0947-0119 exhibits an even
shallower pressure profile than RCS J2319+0038 and is more likely a
non-cool-core cluster. The SZE centroid position is offset by more than 140
$h_{70}^{-1}$kpc from the peaks of galaxy distribution in HSC J0947-0119,
suggesting a stronger influence of mergers in this cluster. We conclude that
these distant clusters are at a very early stage of developing the cool cores

complexity of orbits (periods of attractors, transients, etc) as well as
hardness of the standard well-studied decision problems for automata networks

orthogonality results for these problems: the hardness of a single one does not

all of them. As a complement, we develop a proof technique to establish
intrinsic simulation and universality results which is suitable to deal with
families of symmetric networks were connections are non-oriented. It is based
on an operation of glueing of networks, which allows to produce complex orbits
in large networks from compatible pseudo-orbits in small networks. As an

  If $b$ lies in a $\tilde \gamma$-H\""older space, $\tilde \gamma>1-\gamma$, we

Partial Differential Equation. Thanks to our analysis, we also get a H\""older

that have dense stellar regions in their background, these events may occur
several time a year, warranting their continuous or recurrent monitoring.
Resolved imaging and spectroscopy of the evolving morphology of an Einstein

the Einstein ring amounts to a direct measurement of the lens mass. The
changing orientation of the major and minor images of the source offers
astrometric information related to the mutual orientation of the objects. The

  Case Study",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conformance checking is a process mining technique that allows verifying the
conformance of process instances to a given model. Thus, this technique is
predestined to be used in the medical context for the comparison of treatment
cases with clinical guidelines. However, medical processes are highly variable,
highly dynamic, and complex. This makes the use of imperative conformance
checking approaches in the medical domain difficult. Studies show that
declarative approaches can better address these characteristics. However, none
of the approaches has yet gained practical acceptance. Another challenge are
alignments, which usually do not add any value from a medical point of view.
For this reason, we investigate in a case study the usability of the HL7
standard Arden Syntax for declarative, rule-based conformance checking and the
use of manually modeled alignments. Using the approach, it was possible to
check the conformance of treatment cases and create medically meaningful
alignments for large parts of a medical guideline.

because it allows for modular design and facilitates data reuse through
knowledge transfer. In control theory, prioritized composition is realized by
null-space control, where low-priority control actions are projected into the
null-space of high-priority control actions. Such a method is currently
unavailable for Reinforcement Learning. We propose a novel, task-prioritized
composition framework for Reinforcement Learning, which involves a novel
concept: The indifferent-space of Reinforcement Learning policies. Our
framework has the potential to facilitate knowledge transfer and modular design
while greatly increasing data efficiency and data reuse for Reinforcement
Learning agents. Further, our approach can ensure high-priority constraint
satisfaction, which makes it promising for learning in safety-critical domains
like robotics. Unlike null-space control, our approach allows learning globally
optimal policies for the compound task by online learning in the
indifference-space of higher-level policies after initial compound policy
construction.

solutions to a stochastic nonlinear optimization problem that in general cannot
be obtained in closed form. The optimization problem describes the
counterfactual state of a system after an intervention, and the solutions
represent the optimal decisions in that counterfactual state. In particular, we
develop a counterfactual mean-variance optimization approach, which can be used
for optimal allocation of resources after an intervention. We propose a
doubly-robust nonparametric estimator for the optimal solution of the
counterfactual mean-variance program. We go on to analyze rates of convergence
and provide a closed-form expression for the asymptotic distribution of our
estimator. Our analysis shows that the proposed estimator is robust against
nuisance model misspecification, and can attain fast $\sqrt{n}$ rates with
tractable inference even when using nonparametric methods. This result is
applicable to general nonlinear optimization problems subject to linear
constraints whose coefficients are unknown and must be estimated. In this way,
our findings contribute to the literature in optimization as well as causal
inference. We further discuss the problem of calibrating our counterfactual
covariance estimator to improve the finite-sample properties of our proposed
optimal solution estimators. Finally, we evaluate our methods via simulation,

Three
mechanisms are assessed at the ECAC-wide level: 4D trajectory adjustments (a
combination of actively waiting for connecting passengers and dynamic cost
indexing), flight prioritisation (enabling ATFM slot swapping at arrival
regulations), and flight arrival coordination (where flights are sequenced in
extended arrival managers based on an advanced cost-driven optimisation).
Classical and new metrics, designed to capture network effects, are used to
analyse the results of a micro-level agent-based model. A scenario with
congestion at three hubs is used to assess the 4D trajectory adjustment and the
flight prioritisation mechanisms. Two different scopes for the extended arrival
manager are modelled to analyse the impact of the flight arrival coordination
mechanism. Results show that the 4D trajectory adjustments mechanism succeeds
in reducing costs and delays for connecting passengers. A trade-off between the
interests of the airlines in reducing costs and those of non-connecting
passengers emerges, although passengers benefit overall from the mechanism.
Flight prioritisation is found to have no significant effects at the network
level, as it is applied to a small number of flights. Advanced flight arrival
coordination, as implemented, increases delays and costs in the system. The
arrival manager optimises the arrival sequence of all flights within its scope
but does not consider flight uncertainties, thus leading to sub-optimal
actions.

on a wide range of computer vision tasks. The progressive advances on this
topic have been made through the employment of the transformer framework with
the help of the multi-head attention mechanism. However, the attention-based
image patch interaction potentially suffers from problems of redundant
interactions of intra-class patches and unoriented interactions of inter-class
patches. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Reasoning Transformer (GReaT)
for image parsing to enable image patches to interact following a relation
reasoning pattern. Specifically, the linearly embedded image patches are first
projected into the graph space, where each node represents the implicit visual
center for a cluster of image patches and each edge reflects the relation
weight between two adjacent nodes. After that, global relation reasoning is
performed on this graph accordingly. Finally, all nodes including the relation
information are mapped back into the original space for subsequent processes.
Compared to the conventional transformer, GReaT has higher interaction
efficiency and a more purposeful interaction pattern. Experiments are carried
out on the challenging Cityscapes and ADE20K datasets. Results show that GReaT
achieves consistent performance gains with slight computational overheads on
the state-of-the-art transformer baselines.

Bug assignment is one of the main tasks for resolving bugs. Some Bugs cannot be
fixed properly without making design decisions and have to be assigned to
designers, rather than programmers, to avoid emerging bad smells that may cause
subsequent bug reports. Hence, it is important to refer some bugs to the
designer to check the possible design flaws. Based on our best knowledge, there
are a few works that have considered referring bugs to designers. Hence, this
issue is considered in this work. In this paper, a dataset is created, and a
CNN-based model is proposed to predict the need for assigning a bug to a
designer by learning the peculiarities of bug reports effective in creating bad
smells in the code. The features of each bug are extracted from CNN based on
its textual features, such as a summary and description. The number of bad
samples added to it in the fixing process using the PMD tool determines the bug
tag. The summary and description of the new bug are given to the model and the
model predicts the need to refer to the designer. The accuracy of 75% (or more)
was achieved for datasets with a sufficient number of samples for deep
learning-based model training. A model is proposed to predict bug referrals to
the designer. The efficiency of the model in predicting referrals to the
designer at the time of receiving the bug report was demonstrated by testing
the model on 10 projects.

fundamental vision-language task. Despite lots of works that have achieved
considerable progress for RIS, in this work, we explore an essential question,
""what if the description is wrong or misleading of the text description?"". We
term such a sentence as a negative sentence. However, we find that existing
works cannot handle such settings. To this end, we propose a novel formulation
of RIS, named Robust Referring Image Segmentation (R-RIS). It considers the
negative sentence inputs besides the regularly given text inputs. We present
three different datasets via augmenting the input negative sentences and a new
metric to unify both input types. Furthermore, we design a new
transformer-based model named RefSegformer, where we introduce a token-based
vision and language fusion module. Such module can be easily extended to our
R-RIS setting by adding extra blank tokens. Our proposed RefSegformer achieves
the new state-of-the-art results on three regular RIS datasets and three R-RIS

reliabilities for a large-scale Galactic plane RRL survey with FAST aiming to
investigate the ionized environment in the Galaxy. The data shows that the
bandpass of the FAST 19 beam L-band is severely affected by radio frequency
interferences (RFIs) and standing wave ripples, which can hardly be corrected
by traditional low order polynomials. In this paper, we investigate a series of
penalized least square (PLS) based baseline correction methods for radio
astronomical spectra that usually contain weak signals with high level of
noise. Three promising penalized least squares based methods, AsLS, arPLS, and
asPLS are evaluated. Adopting their advantages, a modified method named rrlPLS
is developed to optimize the baseline fitting to our RRL spectra. To check
their effectiveness, the four methods are tested by simulations and further
verified using observed data sets. It turns out that the rrlPLS method, with
optimized parameter $\lambda = 2 \times 10^8$ , reveals the most sensitive and
reliable emission features in the RRL map. By injecting artificial line
profiles into the real data cube, a further evaluation of profile distortion is
conducted for rrlPLS. Comparing to simulated signals, the processed lines with
low signal-to-noise ratio are less affected, of which the uncertainties are
mainly caused by the rms noise. The rrlPLS method will be applied for baseline
correction in future data processing pipeline of FAST RRL survey. Configured
with proper parameters, the rrlPLS technique verified in this work may also be

Methods: We focus on the nearby star Altair which is known as a very rapidly
rotating star with an equatorial velocity estimated recently at 313 km/s. We
observed this star with the high-resolution spectropolarimeter Neo-Narval
during six nights, with one night of interruption, in September 2020. Results:
We detect significant line profile variations on the mean line profile of the
spectra. Their time-frequency analysis shows that these variations are induced
by gravito-inertial waves propagating at Altair's surface with azimuthal
wavenumbers of order $m=10-15$. With a preliminary computation of the
eigenspectrum using the most recent concordance model of Altair we can give a
first modelling of the observed waves. Conclusions: Altair was known as the
brightest $\delta$ Scuti star. We now see that it is the brightest hybrid
oscillating star with excited gravito-inertial waves and acoustic waves.

behaviour, called 'over-diffusive' propagation, is probably present for such a
complex structure. The (continuum) Guyer-Krumhansl equation stands as a
promising candidate to model such transient thermal behaviour. In order to
obtain a reliable evaluation and thus reliable thermal parameters, we utilize a
novel, state-of-the-art evaluation procedure developed recently using an
analytical solution of the Guyer-Krumhansl equation. Based on our observations,
it turned out that the presence of high porosity alone is necessary but not
satisfactory for non-Fourier behaviour. Additionally, the mentioned non-Fourier

Fourier law. These data serve as a basis to correctly identify the
characteristic heat transfer mechanisms and their corresponding time scales,

that the implementation of CR-NOMA causes little disruption to the legacy OMA

Closed-form expressions for the AoI achieved by the proposed NOMA protocols are
developed to facilitate performance evaluation, and asymptotic studies are
carried out to identify two benefits of using NOMA to reduce the AoI in
wireless networks. One is that the use of NOMA provides users more
opportunities to transmit, which means that the users can update their base

  Effects",,,"10.3389/fphy.2022.1006451",,"physics.plasm-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A one dimensional Vlasov Poisson simulation code is employed to investigate
the plasma sheath considering electron induced secondary electron emission
(SEE) and backscattering. The SEE coefficient is commonly treated as constant
in a range of plasma simulations, here improved SEE model of a charged
dielectric wall is constructed which includes the wall charging effect on SEE
coefficient and the energy dependency of SEE coefficient. Pertinent algorithms
to implement above SEE model in plasma simulation are studied in detail. It is
found that the SEE coefficient increases with the amount of negative wall
charges, which in turn reduces the emissive sheath potential. With energy
dependent SEE coefficient, the sheath potential is a nonlinear function of the
plasma electron temperature, as opposed to the linear relation predicted by
classic emissive sheath theory. Simulation combining both wall charging effect
and SEE coefficient energy dependency suggests that the space charged limited
sheath is formed at high plasma electron temperature levels, where both sheath
potential and surface charging saturate. Additionally, different algorithms to
implement the backscattering in kinetic simulation are tested and compared.
Converting backscattered electron to secondary electron via an effective SEE
coefficient barely affects the sheath properties. The simulation results are
shown to be commensurate with the upgraded sheath theory predictions.

Despite their excellent algorithmic performance, the use of the attention
mechanism and feed-forward network (FFN) demands excessive computational and
memory resources, which often compromises their hardware performance. Although
various sparse variants have been introduced, most approaches only focus on
mitigating the quadratic scaling of attention on the algorithm level, without
explicitly considering the efficiency of mapping their methods on real hardware
designs. Furthermore, most efforts only focus on either the attention mechanism
or the FFNs but without jointly optimizing both parts, causing most of the
current designs to lack scalability when dealing with different input lengths.
This paper systematically considers the sparsity patterns in different variants
from a hardware perspective. On the algorithmic level, we propose FABNet, a
hardware-friendly variant that adopts a unified butterfly sparsity pattern to
approximate both the attention mechanism and the FFNs. On the hardware level, a
novel adaptable butterfly accelerator is proposed that can be configured at
runtime via dedicated hardware control to accelerate different butterfly layers
using a single unified hardware engine. On the Long-Range-Arena dataset, FABNet
achieves the same accuracy as the vanilla Transformer while reducing the amount
of computation by 10 to 66 times and the number of parameters 2 to 22 times. By
jointly optimizing the algorithm and hardware, our FPGA-based butterfly
accelerator achieves 14.2 to 23.2 times speedup over state-of-the-art
accelerators normalized to the same computational budget. Compared with
optimized CPU and GPU designs on Raspberry Pi 4 and Jetson Nano, our system is
up to 273.8 and 15.1 times faster under the same power budget.

this enables an equivalent sparse reformulation of the GMP, where the single

measure variables supported on the maximal cliques of the graph. We explore the
resulting hierarchies of moment-based relaxations for the original dense
formulation of GMP and this new, equivalent ideal-sparse reformulation, when
applied to the problem of bounding nonnegative- and completely positive matrix
factorization ranks. We show that the ideal-sparse hierarchies provide bounds
that are at least as good (and often tighter) as those obtained from the dense
hierarchy. This is in sharp contrast to the situation when exploiting
correlative sparsity, as is most common in the literature, where the resulting
bounds are weaker than the dense bounds. Moreover, while correlative sparsity
requires the underlying graph to be chordal, no such assumption is needed for
ideal-sparsity. Numerical results show that the ideal-sparse bounds are often
tighter and much faster to compute than their dense analogs.

Traditionally, such models are based on principal component analysis (PCA) and

population-based, applying the same deformations to all patients. We present a
hybrid approach which, based on population data, allows to predict
patient-specific inter-fraction variations for an individual patient. We
propose a deep learning probabilistic framework that generates deformation
vector fields (DVFs) warping a patient's planning computed tomography (CT) into
possible patient-specific anatomies. This daily anatomy model (DAM) uses few
random variables capturing groups of correlated movements. Given a new planning
CT, DAM estimates the joint distribution over the variables, with each sample
from the distribution corresponding to a different deformation. We train our
model using dataset of 312 CT pairs from 38 prostate cancer patients. For 2
additional patients (22 CTs), we compute the contour overlap between real and
generated images, and compare the sampled and ground truth distributions of
volume and center of mass changes. With a DICE score of 0.86 and a distance
between prostate contours of 1.09 mm, DAM matches and improves upon PCA-based
models. The distribution overlap further indicates that DAM's sampled movements
match the range and frequency of clinically observed daily changes on repeat
CTs. Conditioned only on a planning CT and contours of a new patient without
any pre-processing, DAM can accurately predict CTs seen during following
treatment sessions, which can be used for anatomically robust treatment

to enable wireless monitoring and interaction with bioparticles, facilitating

Opportunely, the scientific and technical requirements of microfluidics and
microwave techniques converge to the need of system miniaturization to achieve
the required sensitivity levels. This work, therefore, presents the design and
optimization of a measurement system for the detection of bioparticles over the
frequency range $0.01$ to $10$ $\mathrm{GHz}$, with different coplanar
electrodes configurations on a microfluidic platform. The design of the
measurement signal-chain setup is optimized for a novel real-time
superheterodyne microwave detection system. In particular, signal integrity is
achieved by means of a microwave-shielded chamber, which is protected from
external electromagnetic interference that may potentially impact the coplanar
electrodes mounted on the microfluidic device. Additionally, analytical
expressions and experimental validation of the system-level performance are
provided and discussed for the different designs of the coplanar electrodes.
This technique is applied to measure the electrical field perturbation produced
by $10$ $\mathrm{\mu m}$ polystyrene beads with a concentration of $10^5$
$\mathrm{beads/mL}$, and flowing at a rate of $10$ $\mathrm{\mu L/m}$. The
achieved SNR is in the order of $40$ $\mathrm{dB}$ for the three coplanar
electrodes considered.

The standard framework for solving the considered problem is to separately
solve two subproblems: the receiver filter coefficient design and the power
control problem. While the former has a closed-form solution, the latter has
been solved using either second-order methods of high computational complexity
or a first-order method that provides an approximate solution. To deal with
these drawbacks of the existing methods, we propose a mirror prox based method
for the power control problem by equivalently reformulating it as a
convex-concave problem and applying the mirror prox algorithm to find a saddle
point. The simulation results establish the optimality of the proposed solution
and demonstrate that it is more efficient than the known methods. We also
conclude that for large-scale cell-free massive MIMO, joint optimization of
linear receive combining and power control provides significantly better user
fairness than the power control only scheme in which receiver coefficients are
fixed to unity.

orbits of 9.57 and 4.04 days, respectively. In this work, we validate the two
planets and recover an additional single transit-like signal in the light
curve, which suggests the presence of a third transiting planet with a longer
period of about 46 days.We assess the veracity of the TESS transit signals and
use follow-up imaging and time series photometry to rule out false positive
scenarios, including unresolved binary systems, nearby eclipsing binaries or
background/foreground stars contaminating the light curves. Parallax
measurements from Gaia EDR3, together with broad-band photometry and
spectroscopic follow-up by TFOP allowed us to constrain the stellar parameters
of TOI-411, including its radius of$1.157\pm0.025R_\odot$. Adopting this value,
we determined the radii for the three exoplanet candidates and found that
planet $b$ is a super-Earth, with a radius of $1.72\pm0.10R_\oplus$, while
planet $c$ and $d$ are sub-Neptunian planets, with radii
of$2.74\pm0.14R_\oplus$ and $3.23\pm0.19R_\oplus$ respectively. By using
dynamical simulations, we assessed the stability of the system and evaluated
the possibility of the presence of other undetected, non-transiting planets by
investigating its dynamical packing. We find that the system is dynamically
stable and potentially unpacked, with enough space to host at least one more
planet between $c$ and $d$.(Abridged)

(YSR) bound states at the atomic scale. These experiments have been realized
with the help of a scanning tunneling microscope where a superconducting tip is
functionalized with a magnetic impurity and is used to probe another magnetic
impurity deposited on a superconducting substrate. In this way it has become
possible to study for the first time the spin-dependent transport between
individual superconducting bound states. Motivated by these experiments, we
present here a comprehensive theoretical study of the tunneling processes
between YSR bound states in a system in which two magnetic impurities are
coupled to superconducting leads. Our theory is based on a combination of an
Anderson model with broken spin degeneracy to describe the impurities and
nonequilibrium Green's function techniques to compute the current-voltage
characteristics. This combination allows us to describe the spin-dependent
transport for an arbitrary strength of the tunnel coupling between the
impurities. We first focus on the tunnel regime and show that our theory
naturally explains the experimental observations of the appearance of current
peaks in the subgap region due to both the direct and thermal tunneling between
the YSR states in both impurities. Then, we study in detail the case of
junctions with increasing transparency, which has not been experimentally
explored yet, and predict the occurrence of a large variety of (multiple)
Andreev reflections mediated by YSR states that give rise to a very rich
structure in the subgap current. In particular, we predict the occurrence of
multiple Andreev reflections that involve YSR states in different impurities.
These processes have no analogue in single-impurity junctions and they are
manifested as current peaks with negative differential conductance for subgap
voltages.

the internal structure of galaxy clusters. The intra-cluster gas resides in
hydrostatic equilibrium within the Dark Matter gravitational potential.
However, this equilibrium may be perturbed, e.g. as a consequence of thermal
energy losses, feedback and non-thermal pressure supports. Accurate measures of
the gas pressure over the cosmic times are crucial to constrain the cluster
evolution as well as the contribution of astrophysical processes. In this work
we presented a novel algorithm to derive the pressure profiles of galaxy
clusters from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal measured on a combination of
Planck and South Pole Telescope (SPT) observations. The synergy of the two
instruments made it possible to track the profiles on a wide range of spatial
scales. We exploited the sensitivity to the larger scales of the Planck
High-Frequency Instrument to observe the faint peripheries, and the higher
spatial resolution of SPT to solve the innermost regions. We developed a
two-step pipeline to take advantage of the specifications of each instrument.
We first performed a component separation on the two data-sets separately to
remove the background (CMB) and foreground (galactic emission) contaminants.
Then we jointly fitted a parametric pressure profile model on a combination of
Planck and SPT data. We validated our technique on a sample of 6 CHEX-MATE
clusters detected by SPT. We compare the results of the SZ analysis with
profiles derived from X-ray observations with XMM-Newton. We find an excellent
agreement between these two independent probes of the gas pressure structure.

and of star formation. The observed polarization, however, is a product of
magnetic field structure, dust grain properties and grain alignment efficiency,
as well as their variations in the line of sight, making it difficult to
interpret polarization unambiguously. The comparison of polarimetry at multiple
wavelengths is a possible way of mitigating this problem. We use data from
HAWC+/SOFIA and from SCUBA-2/POL-2 (from the BISTRO survey) to analyse the NGC
2071 molecular cloud at 154, 214 and 850 $\mu$m. The polarization angle changes
significantly with wavelength over part of NGC 2071, suggesting a change in
magnetic field morphology on the line of sight as each wavelength best traces
different dust populations. Other possible explanations are the existence of
more than one polarization mechanism in the cloud or scattering from very large
grains. The observed change of polarization fraction with wavelength, and the
214-to-154 $\mu$m polarization ratio in particular, are difficult to reproduce
with current dust models under the assumption of uniform alignment efficiency.
We also show that the standard procedure of using monochromatic intensity as a
proxy for column density may produce spurious results at HAWC+ wavelengths.
Using both long-wavelength (POL-2, 850 $\mu$m) and short-wavelength (HAWC+,
$\lesssim 200\, \mu$m) polarimetry is key in obtaining these results. This
study clearly shows the importance of multi-wavelength polarimetry at
submillimeter bands to understand the dust properties of molecular clouds and
the relationship between magnetic field and star formation.

(UAVs) in maritime communications introduces an aerial dimension to wireless
connectivity going above and beyond current deployments, which are mainly
relying on shore-based base stations with limited coverage and satellite links
with high latency. Considering the potential of UAV-aided wireless
communications, this survey presents the state-of-the-art in UAV-aided maritime
communications, which, in general, are based on both conventional optimization
and machine-learning-aided approaches. More specifically, relevant UAV-based
network architectures are discussed together with the role of their building
blocks. Then, physical-layer, resource management, and cloud/edge computing and
caching UAV-aided solutions in maritime environments are discussed and grouped
based on their performance targets. Moreover, as UAVs are characterized by
flexible deployment with high re-positioning capabilities, studies on UAV
trajectory optimization for maritime applications are thoroughly discussed. In
addition, aiming at shedding light on the current status of real-world
deployments, experimental studies on UAV-aided maritime communications are
presented and implementation details are given. Finally, several important open

various combinatorial search domains, such as two-player games and scientific
discovery. However, directly applying deep RL in planning domains is still
challenging. One major difficulty is that without a human-crafted heuristic
function, reward signals remain zero unless the learning framework discovers
any solution plan. Search space becomes \emph{exponentially larger} as the
minimum length of plans grows, which is a serious limitation for planning
instances with a minimum plan length of hundreds to thousands of steps.
Previous learning frameworks that augment graph search with deep neural
networks and extra generated subgoals have achieved success in various
challenging planning domains. However, generating useful subgoals requires
extensive domain knowledge. We propose a domain-independent method that
augments graph search with graph value iteration to solve hard planning
instances that are out of reach for domain-specialized solvers. In particular,
instead of receiving learning signals only from discovered plans, our approach
also learns from failed search attempts where no goal state has been reached.
The graph value iteration component can exploit the graph structure of local
search space and provide more informative learning signals. We also show how we
use a curriculum strategy to smooth the learning process and perform a full
analysis of how graph value iteration scales and enables learning.

countries, where imaging data, IT infrastructures and clinical expertise are
plentiful. However, slower progress has been made in limited-resource
environments where medical imaging is needed. For example, in Sub-Saharan
Africa the rate of perinatal mortality is very high due to limited access to
antenatal screening. In these countries, AI models could be implemented to help
clinicians acquire fetal ultrasound planes for diagnosis of fetal
abnormalities. So far, deep learning models have been proposed to identify
standard fetal planes, but there is no evidence of their ability to generalise
in centres with limited access to high-end ultrasound equipment and data. This
work investigates different strategies to reduce the domain-shift effect for a
fetal plane classification model trained on a high-resource clinical centre and
transferred to a new low-resource centre. To that end, a classifier trained
with 1,792 patients from Spain is first evaluated on a new centre in Denmark in
optimal conditions with 1,008 patients and is later optimised to reach the same
performance in five African centres (Egypt, Algeria, Uganda, Ghana and Malawi)
with 25 patients each. The results show that a transfer learning approach can
be a solution to integrate small-size African samples with existing large-scale
databases in developed countries. In particular, the model can be re-aligned
and optimised to boost the performance on African populations by increasing the
recall to $0.92\pm0.04$ and at the same time maintaining a high precision
across centres. This framework shows promise for building new AI models
generalisable across clinical centres with limited data acquired in challenging
and heterogeneous conditions and calls for further research to develop new
solutions for usability of AI in countries with less resources.

run hierarchical search, when, on the high level the tree of solutions
candidates is explored, and on the low-level an individual planning for a
specific agent (subject to certain constraints) is carried out. To trade-off
optimality for running time different variants of bounded sub-optimal CBS were
designed, which alter both high- and low-level search routines of CBS.
Moreover, anytime variant of CBS does exist that applies Focal Search (FS) to
the high-level of CBS - Anytime BCBS. However, no comprehensive analysis of how

Meta-Learning (MAML) is a benchmark algorithm comprising two optimization
loops. The inner loop is dedicated to learning a new task and the outer loop
leads to meta-initialization. However, ANIL (almost no inner loop) algorithm
shows that feature reuse is an alternative to rapid learning in MAML. Thus, the
meta-initialization phase makes MAML primed for feature reuse and obviates the
need for rapid learning. Contrary to ANIL, we hypothesize that there may be a
need to learn new features during meta-testing. A new unseen task from
non-similar distribution would necessitate rapid learning in addition reuse and
recombination of existing features. In this paper, we invoke the width-depth
duality of neural networks, wherein, we increase the width of the network by
adding extra computational units (ACU). The ACUs enable the learning of new
atomic features in the meta-testing task, and the associated increased width
facilitates information propagation in the forwarding pass. The newly learnt
features combine with existing features in the last layer for meta-learning.

automation challenging. Large amounts of data recorded by sensors need to be
processed to adequately perform tasks such as diagnosis in case of fault. A
promising approach to deal with this complexity is the concept of causality.
However, most research on causality has focused on inferring causal relations
between parts of an unknown system. Engineering uses causality in a
fundamentally different way: complex systems are constructed by combining
components with known, controllable behavior. As CPS are constructed by the
second approach, most data-based causality models are not suited for industrial
automation. To bridge this gap, a Uniform Causality Model for various
application areas of industrial automation is proposed, which will allow better
communication and better data usage across disciplines. The resulting model
describes the behavior of CPS mathematically and, as the model is evaluated on

dopants around the junction, since the sharpness of the dopant transition
directly influences the built-in potential and the maximum electric field.
Here, a contacted silicon p-n junction is studied through in-situ biased
4D-STEM. Measurements of electric field, built-in voltage, depletion region
width and charge density in the space charge region are combined with
analytical equations as well as finite-element simulations in order to evaluate
the quality of the junction interface. The nominally-symmetric, highly doped
($N_A = N_D = 9\space x \space10^{18} cm^{-3}$) junction presents an electric
field and built-in voltage much lower than expected for an abrupt junction.
These experimental results are consistent with electron holography data. All
measured junction parameters are compatible with the presence of an
intermediate region with a graded profile of the dopants at the p-n interface.
This hypothesis is also consistent with the evolution of the electric field
with bias. These results demonstrate that in-situ biased 4D-STEM enables a

decentralized execution (CTDE) has achieved remarkable success. Individual
Global Max (IGM) decomposition, which is an important element of CTDE, measures
the consistency between local and joint policies. The majority of IGM-based
research focuses on how to establish this consistent relationship, but little
attention has been paid to examining IGM's potential flaws. In this work, we
reveal that the IGM condition is a lossy decomposition, and the error of lossy
decomposition will accumulated in hypernetwork-based methods. To address the
above issue, we propose to adopt an imitation learning strategy to separate the
lossy decomposition from Bellman iterations, thereby avoiding error
accumulation. The proposed strategy is theoretically proved and empirically
verified on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge benchmark problem with zero
sight view. The results also confirm that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art IGM-based approaches.

refractive index gradient orthogonal to the edges may support Floquet bound
states in continuum (BICs). The gradient of the refractive index leads to
strong asymmetry of the Floquet-Bloch spectrum. The mechanism of creation of
such Floquet BICs is understood as emergence of crossings and avoided crossings
of the branches supported by spatially limited stripe array. The whole spectrum
of a finite array is split into the bulk branches being continuation of the
edge states in the extended zone revealing multiple self-crossings and bulk
modes disconnected from the gap states by avoided crossing. Nearly all states
in the system are localized due to the gradient, but topological edge states
manifest much stronger localization than other states. Such strongly localized
Floquet BICs coexist with localized Wannier-Stark-like bulk modes. Robustness
of the edge Floquet states is confirmed by their passage through a localized

expensive black-box functions such as tuning hyperparameter, and designing new

analyzing the inherent hardness of the problem although, given its extensive
use, it is important to understand the fundamental limits of efficient global
optimization algorithms. In this paper, we study the worst-case complexity of
the efficient global optimization problem and, in contrast to existing
kernel-specific results, we derive a unified lower bound for the complexity of
efficient global optimization in terms of the metric entropy of a ball in its
corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space~(RKHS). Specifically, we show
that if there exists a deterministic algorithm that achieves suboptimality gap
smaller than $\epsilon$ for any function $f\in S$ in $T$ function evaluations,
it is necessary that $T$ is at least
$\Omega\left(\frac{\log\mathcal{N}(S(\mathcal{X}),
4\epsilon,\|\cdot\|_\infty)}{\log(\frac{R}{\epsilon})}\right)$, where
$\mathcal{N}(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)$ is the covering number, $S$ is the ball
centered at $0$ with radius $R$ in the RKHS and $S(\mathcal{X})$ is the
restriction of $S$ over the feasible set $\mathcal{X}$. Moreover, we show that
this lower bound nearly matches the upper bound attained by non-adaptive search
algorithms for the commonly used squared exponential kernel and the Mat\'ern
kernel with a large smoothness parameter $\nu$, up to a replacement of $d/2$ by
$d$ and a logarithmic term $\log\frac{R}{\epsilon}$. That is to say, our lower
bound is nearly optimal for these kernels.

computer vision. Traditionally pose estimation is concerned with the
determination of a single best estimate. However, a single estimate is unable
to express visual ambiguity, which in many cases is unavoidable due to object
symmetries or occlusion of identifying features. Inability to account for
ambiguities in pose can lead to failure in subsequent methods, which is
unacceptable when the cost of failure is high. Estimates of full pose
distributions are, contrary to single estimates, well suited for expressing
uncertainty on pose. Motivated by this, we propose a novel pose distribution
estimation method. An implicit formulation of the probability distribution over
object pose is derived from an intermediary representation of an object as a
set of keypoints. This ensures that the pose distribution estimates have a high
level of interpretability. Furthermore, our method is based on conservative
approximations, which leads to reliable estimates. The method has been
evaluated on the task of rotation distribution estimation on the YCB-V and
T-LESS datasets and performs reliably on all objects.

period, in order to produce a consistent catalogue of reliable and precise
ephemerides. This work presents a homogenous catalogue of updated ephemerides
for 450 planets, generated by the integration of $\sim$18000 data points from
multiple sources. These sources include observations from ground-based
telescopes (ExoClock network and ETD), mid-time values from the literature and
light-curves from space telescopes (Kepler/K2 and TESS). With all the above, we
manage to collect observations for half of the post-discovery years (median),
with data that have a median uncertainty less than one minute. In comparison
with literature, the ephemerides generated by the project are more precise and
less biased. More than 40\% of the initial literature ephemerides had to be
updated to reach the goals of the project, as they were either of low precision
or drifting. Moreover, the integrated approach of the project enables both the
monitoring of the majority of the Ariel candidates (95\%), and also the
identification of missing data. The dedicated ExoClock network effectively
supports this task by contributing additional observations when a gap in the
data is identified. These results highlight the need for continuous monitoring
to increase the observing coverage of the candidate planets. Finally, the
extended observing coverage of planets allows us to detect trends (TTVs -
Transit Timing Variations) for a sample of 19 planets. All products, data, and
codes used in this work are open and accessible to the wider scientific
community.

spacings taken from random matrix theory. We see how the spacings between
neighbouring eigenvalues from certain collections of random matrices has some
potential for modelling the spacing between active origins. This suitability
can be further augmented with the use of uniform thinning which acts as a
continuous deformation between correlated eigenvalue spacings and exponential
(Poissonian) spacings. We model the process as a modified 2D Poisson process
with an added exclusion rule to identify active points based on their position
on the chromosome and trigger time relative to other origins. We see how this
can be reduced to a stochastic geometry problem and show analytically that two
active origins are unlikely to be close together, regardless of how many
non-active points are between them. In particular, we see how these active
origins repel linearly. We then see how data from various DNA datasets match

to be aggregated per transmission which realized a significant enhancement in
the throughput performance of WLAN. However, it is difficult to efficiently
utilize the benefits of frame aggregation in the downlink MU-MIMO channels as
stations have heterogeneous transmission demands and data transmission rates.
As a result of this, wasted space channel time will occur which degrades
transmission efficiency. In addressing these challenges, the existing studies
have proposed different approaches. However, most of these approaches did not
consider a machine-Learning based optimization solution. The main contribution
of this paper is to propose a machine-learning-based frame size optimization

throughput measurement and collected frame size-system throughput patterns
which contain knowledge about the effects of traffic patterns, channel

uses a neural network to correctly model the system throughput as a function of
the system frame size. After training the neural network, we obtain the
gradient information to adjust the frame size. the performance of the proposed

  Amongst those tasks, link prediction is one of the fundamental problems for

  However, GNNs are not immune to adversarial attacks, i.e., carefully crafted
malicious examples that are designed to fool the predictive model.
  In this work, we focus on a specific, white-box attack to GNN-based link
prediction models, where a malicious node aims to appear in the list of
recommended nodes for a given target victim.
  To achieve this goal, the attacker node may also count on the cooperation of
other existing peers that it directly controls, namely on the ability to inject
a number of ``vicious'' nodes in the network.
  Specifically, all these malicious nodes can add new edges or remove existing
ones, thereby perturbing the original graph.
  Thus, we propose SAVAGE, a novel framework and a method to mount this type of
link prediction attacks.
  SAVAGE formulates the adversary's goal as an optimization task, striking the
balance between the effectiveness of the attack and the sparsity of malicious
resources required.
  Extensive experiments conducted on real-world and synthetic datasets
demonstrate that adversarial attacks implemented through SAVAGE indeed achieve
high attack success rate yet using a small amount of vicious nodes.
  Finally, despite those attacks require full knowledge of the target model, we
show that they are successfully transferable to other black-box methods for
link prediction.

To mitigate potential underestimation for individuals with severe disease

against the mountain and initiate jumping maneuvers. Between jumps, a hoist is
used to wind/unwind the rope to move vertically and affect the lateral motion.
This simple (yet effective) two-fold actuation allows the system to achieve
high safety and energy efficiency. Indeed, the rope prevents the robot from

results show that the thermal conductivity of graphene can be tailored in the
range of 1559 W/m-K (49%) to 4093 W/m-K (128%), compared with the intrinsic

The results are obtained through both ab initio calculations and molecular

prenatal counseling and diagnosis in disorders affecting the brain. Machine
learning based segmentation plays an important role in the quantification of
brain development. However, a limiting factor is the lack of sufficiently
large, labeled training data. Our study explored the application of SPADE, a
conditional general adversarial network (cGAN), which learns the mapping from
the label to the image space. The input to the network was super-resolution
T2-weighted cerebral MRI data of 120 fetuses (gestational age range: 20-35
weeks, normal and pathological), which were annotated for 7 different tissue
categories. SPADE networks were trained on 256*256 2D slices of the
reconstructed volumes (image and label pairs) in each orthogonal orientation.
To combine the generated volumes from each orientation into one image, a simple
mean of the outputs of the three networks was taken. Based on the label maps
only, we synthesized highly realistic images. However, some finer details, like
small vessels were not synthesized. A structural similarity index (SSIM) of
0.972+-0.016 and correlation coefficient of 0.974+-0.008 were achieved. To
demonstrate the capacity of the cGAN to create new anatomical variants, we
artificially dilated the ventricles in the segmentation map and created
synthetic MRI of different degrees of fetal hydrocephalus. cGANs, such as the
SPADE algorithm, allow the generation of hypothetically unseen scenarios and
anatomical configurations in the label space, which data in turn can be
utilized for training various machine learning algorithms. In the future, this
algorithm would be used for generating large, synthetic datasets representing
fetal brain development. These datasets would potentially improve the
performance of currently available segmentation networks.

grounded on the fact that, according to these models, the dynamics is driven by
a noise that, besides collapsing the wave function in space, generates a
diffusive motion with characteristic signatures, which, though small, can be
tested. The non-interferometric approach might seem applicable only to those
models which implement the collapse through a noisy dynamics, not to any model,
which collapses the wave function in space. Here we show that this is not the

diffusive. Specifically, we prove that any space-translation invariant dynamics
which complies with the no-signaling constraint, if collapsing the wave
function in space, must change the average momentum of the system, and/or its

resulting in destructive tissue damage and incomplete tissue repair. Scar
formation is generally considered as a barrier for regeneration in central
nervous system (CNS), while the intrinsic mechanism of scar-forming after
spinal cord injury has not been completed deciphered. Methods: We assessed
cholesterol hemostasis in spinal cord lesions and injured peripheral nerves
using confocal reflection microscopy and real-time PCR analyses. The
involvement of the proteins, which were predicted to promote cholesterol efflux
in spinal cord lesions, were assessed with Liver X receptor (LXR) agonist and
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) deficiency. The role of reverse cholesterol transport
(RCT) in cholesterol clearance was examined in APOE KO mice injured sciatic
nerves and myelin-overloaded macrophages in vitro. Finally, we determined the
consequence of excess cholesterol accumulation in CNS by transplantation of
myelin into neonatal spinal cord lesions. Results: We found that excess
cholesterol accumulates in phagocytes and is inefficiently removed in spinal
cord lesions in young-adult mice. Interestingly, we observed that excessive
cholesterol also accumulates in injured peripheral nerves, but is subsequently
removed by RCT. Meanwhile, preventing RCT led to macrophage accumulation and
fibrosis in injured peripheral nerves. Furthermore, the neonatal mouse spinal
cord lesions are devoid of myelin-derived lipids, and able to heal without
excess cholesterol accumulation. We found that transplantation of myelin into
neonatal lesions disrupts healing with excessive cholesterol accumulation,
persistent macrophage activation and fibrosis, indicating myelin-derived
cholesterol plays a critical role in impaired wound healing.

proving safety of hybrid systems possibly over an infinite time horizon. We
present a novel condition on barrier certificates, termed the invariant
barrier-certificate condition, that witnesses unbounded-time safety of
differential dynamical systems. The proposed condition is the weakest possible
one to attain inductive invariance. We show that discharging the invariant
barrier-certificate condition -- thereby synthesizing invariant barrier
certificates -- can be encoded as solving an optimization problem subject to
bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). We further propose a synthesis algorithm
based on difference-of-convex programming, which approaches a local optimum of
the BMI problem via solving a series of convex optimization problems. This
algorithm is incorporated in a branch-and-bound framework that searches for the
global optimum in a divide-and-conquer fashion. We present a weak completeness
result of our method, namely, a barrier certificate is guaranteed to be found
(under some mild assumptions) whenever there exists an inductive invariant (in
the form of a given template) that suffices to certify safety of the system.
Experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency

differential elasticity in the second lineage segregation of the embryonic
inner cell mass into epiblast (EPI) cells - that will develop into the fetus -

significantly more elastic than EPI-primed cells. Using a model of two cell
types differing only in elasticity we show that differential elasticity alone

with MegaCam on CFHT and measure effective radii of $1.7-1.9$ kpc, central
surface brightnesses of $24.7-25.7$ mag and a stellar mass of $\sim7 \times
10^7 M_{\odot}$. Assuming a symmetric feature on the other side of the galaxy,
we calculate that $30-36$% of F8D1's present-day luminosity is contained in the
tail. We argue that the most likely origin of F8D1's disruption is a recent
close passage to M81, which would have stripped its gas and quenched its star
formation. As the only UDG that has so far been studied to such faint surface
brightness depths, the unveiling of F8D1's tidal disruption is important. It
leaves open the possibility that many other UDGs could be the result of similar
processes, with the most telling signatures of this lurking below current
detection limits.

Protection Regulation (GDPR) through data processing agreements (DPAs).
Checking the compliance of DPAs contributes to the compliance verification of
software systems as DPAs are an important source of requirements for software
development involving the processing of personal data. However, manually
checking whether a given DPA complies with GDPR is challenging as it requires
significant time and effort for understanding and identifying DPA-relevant
compliance requirements in GDPR and then verifying these requirements in the
DPA. In this paper, we propose an automated solution to check the compliance of
a given DPA against GDPR. In close interaction with legal experts, we first
built two artifacts: (i) the ""shall"" requirements extracted from the GDPR
provisions relevant to DPA compliance and (ii) a glossary table defining the
legal concepts in the requirements. Then, we developed an automated solution
that leverages natural language processing (NLP) technologies to check the
compliance of a given DPA against these ""shall"" requirements. Specifically, our
approach automatically generates phrasal-level representations for the textual
content of the DPA and compares it against predefined representations of the
""shall"" requirements. Over a dataset of 30 actual DPAs, the approach correctly
finds 618 out of 750 genuine violations while raising 76 false violations, and
further correctly identifies 524 satisfied requirements. The approach has thus
an average precision of 89.1%, a recall of 82.4%, and an accuracy of 84.6%.
Compared to a baseline that relies on off-the-shelf NLP tools, our approach
provides an average accuracy gain of ~20 percentage points. The accuracy of our
approach can be improved to ~94% with limited manual verification effort.

driving but is extremely challenging due to staggering motion uncertainty.
Recently, most motion forecasting methods resort to the goal-based strategy,
i.e., predicting endpoints of motion trajectories as conditions to regress the
entire trajectories, so that the search space of solution can be reduced.
However, accurate goal coordinates are hard to predict and evaluate. In
addition, the point representation of the destination limits the utilization of
a rich road context, leading to inaccurate prediction results in many cases.
Goal area, i.e., the possible destination area, rather than goal coordinate,
could provide a more soft constraint for searching potential trajectories by
involving more tolerance and guidance. In view of this, we propose a new goal
area-based framework, named Goal Area Network (GANet), for motion forecasting,
which models goal areas rather than exact goal coordinates as preconditions for
trajectory prediction, performing more robustly and accurately. Specifically,
we propose a GoICrop (Goal Area of Interest) operator to effectively extract
semantic lane features in goal areas and model actors' future interactions,
which benefits a lot for future trajectory estimations. GANet ranks the 1st on
the leaderboard of Argoverse Challenge among all public literature (till the

transforms an arbitrary LPG dataset into a representation that can be directly

the features of the laser operation mode they use. However, at high repetition
rates of laser pulses or when pulses are generated at a bias current close to
the threshold, the phase randomization condition may be violated. This paper
describes theoretical and experimental methods for estimating the degree of
phase randomization in a gain-switched laser. We consider in detail different
situations of laser pulse interference and show that the interference signal
remains quantum in nature even in the presence of classical phase drift in the
interferometer provided that the phase diffusion in a laser is efficient
enough. Moreover, we formulate the relationship between the previously
introduced quantum reduction factor and the leftover hash lemma. Using this
relationship, we develop a method to estimate the quantum noise contribution to
the interference signal in the presence of phase correlations. Finally, we
introduce a simple experimental method based on the analysis of statistical
interference fringes, providing more detailed information about the
probabilistic properties of laser pulse interference.

the benefit of relaxed attention across several tasks with clear improvement in

the discrete Riesz transforms arising from discretizing singular integrals on

$\ell^p$ norm as the continuous Riesz transforms on $\mathbb{R}^d$ which is
dimension independent and equals the norm of the classical Hilbert transform on

tunable VP-QAHE attributes to light-induced trigonal warping and multiple band

Nevertheless, there is still little work to be completed. By virtue of the
novel technique, this paper focuses on the mean-square convergence and
stability of the backward Euler method (BEM) for SDDEs whose drift and
diffusion coefficients can both grow polynomially. The upper mean-square error
bounds of BEM are obtained. Then the convergence rate, which is one-half, is
revealed without using the moment boundedness of numerical solutions.
Furthermore, under fairly general conditions, the novel technique is applied to
prove that the BEM can inherit the exponential mean-square stability with a

constraining the glassy membrane matrix while relaxing the brush-like membrane

nonequilibrium morphologies of a model triblock copolymer, and we correlate
diffusivity with structural descriptors of the morphologies. We also compare
the model's predictions to alternative approaches based on simple lattice

assigned to axiomatic theories. According to conventional wisdom, ordinal
analysis measures the strength of theories. Yet what is the attendant notion of
strength? In this paper we present abstract characterizations of ordinal
analysis that address this question.
  First, we characterize ordinal analysis as a partition of
$\Sigma^1_1$-definable and $\Pi^1_1$-sound theories, namely, the partition
whereby two theories are equivalent if they have the same proof-theoretic
ordinal. We show that no equivalence relation $\equiv$ is finer than the
ordinal analysis partition if both: (1) $T\equiv U$ whenever $T$ and $U$ prove
the same $\Pi^1_1$ sentences; (2) $T\equiv T+U$ for every set $U$ of true
$\Sigma^1_1$ sentences. In fact, no such equivalence relation makes a single
distinction that the ordinal analysis partition does not make.
  Second, we characterize ordinal analysis as an ordering on
arithmetically-definable and $\Pi^1_1$-sound theories, namely, the ordering
wherein $T< U$ if the proof-theoretic ordinal of $T$ is less than the
proof-theoretic ordinal of $U$. The standard ways of measuring the strength of
theories are consistency strength and inclusion of $\Pi^0_1$ theorems. We
introduce analogues of these notions -- $\Pi^1_1$-reflection strength and
inclusion of $\Pi^1_1$ theorems -- in the presence of an oracle for
$\Sigma^1_1$ truths, and prove that they coincide with the ordering induced by
ordinal analysis.

minimize charging cost while guarantee that the EV's battery

this paper formulates the EV charging scheduling problem as a constrained

repeater stations are minimal: Each repeater uses only $\Theta(\log^2 R)$
qubits with a lifetime of order $O(t_{\textrm{local}})$. We prove a converse
bound $\Omega(\log R)$ on the number of qubits per repeater among all
low-latency schemes for fault-tolerant quantum communication over distance $R$.
Furthermore, all operations within a repeater are local when the qubits are
arranged in a square lattice.
  The noise-resilience of our scheme relies on the fault-tolerance properties
of the underlying cluster state. We give a full error analysis, establishing a
fault-tolerance threshold against general (circuit-level) local stochastic
noise affecting preparation, entangling operations and measurements. This
includes, in particular, errors correlated in time and space. Our conservative
analytical estimates are surprisingly optimistic, suggesting that the scheme is
suited for long-range entanglement generation both in and between near-term
quantum computing devices.

  Figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.DC cs.GT cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Incentives that compensate for the involved costs in the decentralized
training of a Federated Learning (FL) model act as a key stimulus for clients'
long-term participation. However, it is challenging to convince clients for
quality participation in FL due to the absence of: (i) full information on the
client's data quality and properties; (ii) the value of client's data
contributions; and (iii) the trusted mechanism for monetary incentive offers.
This often leads to poor efficiency in training and communication. While
several works focus on strategic incentive designs and client selection to
overcome this problem, there is a major knowledge gap in terms of an overall
design tailored to the foreseen digital economy, including Web 3.0, while
simultaneously meeting the learning objectives. To address this gap, we propose
a contribution-based tokenized incentive scheme, namely \texttt{FedToken},
backed by blockchain technology that ensures fair allocation of tokens amongst
the clients that corresponds to the valuation of their data during model
training. Leveraging the engineered Shapley-based scheme, we first approximate
the contribution of local models during model aggregation, then strategically
schedule clients lowering the communication rounds for convergence and anchor
ways to allocate \emph{affordable} tokens under a constrained monetary budget.
Extensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.

(MEC) has been recognized as a promising technology to support emerging
computation-intensive applications. Besides, non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA)-aided MEC system can further enhance the spectral-efficiency with
massive tasks offloading. However, with more dynamic devices brought online and
the uncontrollable stochastic channel environment, it is even desirable to
deploy appealing technique, i.e., intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), in the
MEC system to flexibly tune the communication environment and improve the
system energy efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the joint offloading,
communication and computation resource allocation for IRS-assisted NOMA MEC
system. We firstly formulate a mixed integer energy efficiency maximization
problem with system queue stability constraint. We then propose the
Lyapunov-function-based Mixed Integer Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(LMIDDPG) algorithm which is based on the centralized reinforcement learning
(RL) framework. To be specific, we design the mixed integer action space
mapping which contains both continuous mapping and integer mapping. Moreover,
the award function is defined as the upper-bound of the Lyapunov
drift-plus-penalty function. To enable end devices (EDs) to choose actions
independently at the execution stage, we further propose the Heterogeneous
Multi-agent LMIDDPG (HMA-LMIDDPG) algorithm based on distributed RL framework
with homogeneous EDs and heterogeneous base station (BS) as heterogeneous
multi-agent. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms can achieve
superior energy efficiency performance to the benchmark algorithms while
maintaining the queue stability. Specially, the distributed structure
HMA-LMIDDPG can acquire more energy efficiency gain than centralized structure
LMIDDPG.

lens samples: a sample of Luminous red galaxies, redMaGiC, and a sample with a
redshift-dependent magnitude limit, MagLim. We account for the effect of
magnification on both the flux and size selection of galaxies, accounting for
systematic effects using the Balrog image simulations. We estimate the impact
of magnification on the galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing cosmology
analysis, finding it to be a significant systematic for the MagLim sample. We
show cosmological constraints from the galaxy clustering auto-correlation and
galaxy-galaxy lensing signal with different magnifications priors, finding
broad consistency in cosmological parameters in $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM.
However, when magnification bias amplitude is allowed to be free, we find the
two-point correlations functions prefer a different amplitude to the fiducial
input derived from the image simulations. We validate the magnification
analysis by comparing the cross-clustering between lens bins with the
prediction from the baseline analysis, which uses only the auto-correlation of
the lens bins, indicating systematics other than magnification may be the cause
of the discrepancy. We show adding the cross-clustering between lens redshift
bins to the fit significantly improves the constraints on lens magnification
parameters and allows uninformative priors to be used on magnification
coefficients, without any loss of constraining power or prior volume concerns.

high-temperature velocities are much higher than previous experimental-based

particles coherently hop on a one-dimensional lattice and are subject to
dissipative processes analogous to those of classical reaction-diffusion
models. Particles can either annihilate in pairs, $A+A \to \emptyset$,
coagulate upon contact, $A+A \to A$, and possibly also branch, $A \to A+A$. In
classical settings, the interplay between these processes and particle
diffusion leads to critical dynamics as well as to absorbing-state phase
transitions. Here, we analyze the impact of coherent hopping and of quantum
superposition, focusing on the so-called reaction-limited regime. Here, spatial
density fluctuations are quickly smoothed out due to fast hopping, which for
classical systems is described by a mean-field approach. By exploiting the
time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble method, we demonstrate that quantum
coherence and destructive interference play a crucial role in these systems and
are responsible for the emergence of locally protected dark states and
collective behavior beyond mean-field. This can manifest both at stationarity
and during the relaxation dynamics. Our results highlight fundamental
differences between classical nonequilibrium dynamics and their quantum
counterpart and show that quantum effects indeed change collective universal
behavior.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stac2686",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  MAXI J1820+070 is a low-mass X-ray binary with a black hole as a compact
object. This binary underwent an exceptionally bright X-ray outburst from March
to October 2018, showing evidence of a non-thermal particle population through
its radio emission during this whole period. The combined results of 59.5 hours
of observations of the MAXI J1820+070 outburst with the H.E.S.S., MAGIC and
VERITAS experiments at energies above 200 GeV are presented, together with
Fermi-LAT data between 0.1 and 500 GeV, and multiwavelength observations from
radio to X-rays. Gamma-ray emission is not detected from MAXI J1820+070, but
the obtained upper limits and the multiwavelength data allow us to put
meaningful constraints on the source properties under reasonable assumptions
regarding the non-thermal particle population and the jet synchrotron spectrum.
In particular, it is possible to show that, if a high-energy gamma-ray emitting
region is present during the hard state of the source, its predicted flux
should be at most a factor of 20 below the obtained Fermi-LAT upper limits, and
closer to them for magnetic fields significantly below equipartition. During
the state transitions, under the plausible assumption that electrons are
accelerated up to ~ 500 GeV, the multiwavelength data and the gamma-ray upper
limits lead consistently to the conclusion that a potential high-energy and
very-high-energy gamma-ray emitting region should be located at a distance from
the black hole ranging between 10^11 and 10^13 cm. Similar outbursts from
low-mass X-ray binaries might be detectable in the near future with upcoming
instruments such as CTA.

fringe platforms with lower moderation standards and where antisocial behaviors

often remain co-active across mainstream and fringe platforms, antisocial
behaviors may spill over onto the mainstream platform. We study this possible
spillover by analyzing around 70,000 users from three banned communities that
migrated to fringe platforms: r/The_Donald, r/GenderCritical, and r/Incels.
Using a difference-in-differences design, we contrast co-active users with

participation on users' antisocial behavior on Reddit. Our results show that
participating in the fringe communities increases users' toxicity on Reddit (as
measured by Perspective API) and involvement with subreddits similar to the

intensifies with time and exposure to the fringe platform. In short, we find
evidence for a spillover of antisocial behavior from fringe platforms onto

matter electronic structure calculations. In this work, we employ
multi-objective optimization to maximize pseudopotential softness while
maintaining high accuracy and transferability. To accomplish this, we develop a
formulation in which softness and accuracy are simultaneously maximized, with
accuracy determined by the ability to reproduce all-electron energy differences
between Bravais lattice structures, whereupon the resulting Pareto frontier is
scanned for the softest pseudopotential that provides the desired accuracy in
established transferability tests. We employ an evolutionary algorithm to solve
the multi-objective optimization problem and apply it to generate a
comprehensive table of optimized norm-conserving Vanderbilt (ONCV)
pseudopotentials (https://github.com/SPARC-X/SPMS-psps). We show that the
resulting table is softer than existing tables of comparable accuracy, while
more accurate than tables of comparable softness. The potentials thus afford
the possibility to speed up calculations in a broad range of applications areas
while maintaining high accuracy.

combined effect of low-light and glare from vehicle headlight or tail-light

State-of-the-art GAN models have attempted to improve vehicle detection

However, these models have been found to under-perform during night-time
conditions compared to day-time conditions. Therefore, this study attempts to
alleviate this shortcoming by proposing three different approaches based on
combination of GAN models at two different levels that tries to reduce the
feature distribution gap between day-time and night-time infrared images.
Quantitative analysis to compare the performance of the proposed models with

discriminant power of discretized data, while overlooking the fact that the
primary target of data discretization in classification is to improve the
generalization performance. As a result, the data tend to be over-split into
many small bins since the data without discretization retain the maximal
discriminant information. Thus, we propose a Max-Dependency-Min-Divergence
(MDmD) criterion that maximizes both the discriminant information and
generalization ability of the discretized data. More specifically, the
Max-Dependency criterion maximizes the statistical dependency between the
discretized data and the classification variable while the Min-Divergence
criterion explicitly minimizes the JS-divergence between the training data and
the validation data for a given discretization scheme. The proposed MDmD
criterion is technically appealing, but it is difficult to reliably estimate
the high-order joint distributions of attributes and the classification

Max-Relevance-Min-Divergence (MRmD) discretization scheme, where each attribute
is discretized separately, by simultaneously maximizing the discriminant

been proposed to predict the optical field solution of a single instance of a

In this work, for the first time, a physics-agnostic neural operator-based

Maxwell PDEs for ultra-fast parametric photonic device simulation. We balance
the efficiency and generalization of NeurOLight via several novel techniques.
Specifically, we discretize different devices into a unified domain, represent
parametric PDEs with a compact wave prior, and encode the incident light via
masked source modeling. We design our model with parameter-efficient
cross-shaped NeurOLight blocks and adopt superposition-based augmentation for
data-efficient learning. With these synergistic approaches, NeurOLight
generalizes to a large space of unseen simulation settings, demonstrates
2-orders-of-magnitude faster simulation speed than numerical solvers, and
outperforms prior neural network models by ~54% lower prediction error with
~44% fewer parameters. Our code is available at

ratios of neutrino and heavier particle masses. For processes with a
neutrino-antineutrino pair of the same flavor in the final state, we formulate

On short timescales it varies due to the superposition of intensity
fluctuations produced by turbulent convection and acoustic oscillations. On
longer scale times, it changes due to photospheric magnetic activity, mainly
because of the facular brightenings and dimmings caused by sunspots. While
modern TSI variations have been monitored from space since 1970s, TSI
variations over much longer periods can only be estimated using either
historical observations of magnetic features, possibly supported by flux
transport models, or from the measurements of the cosmogenic isotope (e.g.,
\textsuperscript{14}C or \textsuperscript{10}Be) concentrations in tree rings
and ice cores. The reconstruction of the TSI in the last few centuries,
particularly in the 17th/18th centuries during the Maunder minimum, is of
primary importance for studying climatic effects. To separate the temporal
components of the irradiance variations, specifically the magnetic cycle from
secular variability, we decomposed the signals associated with historical
observations of magnetic features and the solar modulation potential $\Phi$ by
applying an Empirical Mode Decomposition algorithm. Thus, the reconstruction is
empirical and does not require any feature contrast or field transport model.
The assessed difference between the mean value during the Maunder minimum and
the present value is $\simeq2.5 Wm^{-2}$. Moreover it shows, in the first half
of the last century, a growth of $\simeq 1.5 W m^{-2}$ which stops around the
middle of the century to remain constant for the next 50 years, apart from the
modulation due to the solar cycle.

subset of features in the packing pattern for classification purposes. SSA is a
recently proposed algorithm that has not been systematically applied to feature
selection problems. After verification by the CEC2020 benchmark function, TFSSA
is used to select the best feature combination to maximize classification
accuracy and minimize the number of selected features. The proposed TFSSA is
compared with nine algorithms in the literature. Nine evaluation metrics are
used to properly evaluate and compare the performance of these algorithms on
twenty-one datasets from the UCI repository. Furthermore, the approach is
applied to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) dataset, yielding the best
average classification accuracy and the average number of feature selections,
respectively, of 93.47% and 2.1. Experimental results confirm the advantages of
the proposed algorithm in improving classification accuracy and reducing the
number of selected features compared to other wrapper-based algorithms.

have played an important role in monitoring and analyzing weather and climate
changes. However, satellite imagery is a kind of observation data and exists a
significant time delay when transmitting the data back to Earth. It is
important to make accurate predictions for meteorological satellite images,
especially the nowcasting prediction up to 2 hours ahead. In recent years,
there has been growing interest in the research of nowcasting prediction
applications of weather radar images based on deep learning. Compared to the
weather radar images prediction problem, the main challenge for meteorological
satellite images prediction is the large-scale observation areas and therefore
the large sizes of the observation products. Here we present a deep
multi-scales extrapolation fusion method, to address the challenge of the
meteorological satellite images nowcasting prediction. First, we downsample the
original satellite images dataset with large size to several images datasets
with smaller resolutions, then we use a deep spatiotemporal sequences
prediction method to generate the multi-scales prediction images with different
resolutions separately. Second, we fuse the multi-scales prediction results to
the targeting prediction images with the original size by a conditional
generative adversarial network. The experiments based on the FY-4A
meteorological satellite data show that the proposed method can generate
realistic prediction images that effectively capture the evolutions of the
weather systems in detail. We believe that the general idea of this work can be
potentially applied to other spatiotemporal sequence prediction tasks with a
large size.

maximum allowable delays of vehicle-borne sensor network is derived backwards.
Simulations verify that while considering various non-ideal factors above, the
proposed DFK algorithm produces more accurate and robust fusion estimation

applications. Simultaneously, a mobile car trajectory tracking experiment is
carried out, which further verifies the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

(AoI) and transmit power consumption in a vehicular network, where a roadside
unit (RSU) provides timely updates about a set of physical processes to
vehicles. Each vehicle is interested in maintaining the freshness of its
information status about one or more physical processes. A framework is
proposed to optimize the decisions to unicast, multicast, broadcast, or not
transmit updates to vehicles as well as power allocations to minimize the AoI
and the RSU's power consumption over a time horizon. The formulated problem is
a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP), thus a global optimal
solution is difficult to achieve. In this context, we first develop an ant
colony optimization (ACO) solution which provides near-optimal performance and
thus serves as an efficient benchmark. Then, for real-time implementation, we
develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that captures the
vehicles' demands and channel conditions in the state space and assigns
processes to vehicles through dynamic unicast-multicast scheduling actions.
Complexity analysis of the proposed algorithms is presented. Simulation results
depict interesting trade-offs between AoI and power consumption as a function
of the network parameters.

into smaller groups which allow for partial transaction processing, relaying
and storage. Hence, instead of running one blockchain, we will run multiple
blockchains in parallel, and call each one a shard. Sharding can be applied to
address shortcomings due to compulsory duplication of three resources in
blockchains, i.e., computation, communication and storage. The most pressing
issue in blockchains today is throughput. Hence, usually the main focus is to
shard computation which leads to concurrent transaction processing. In this
report, we propose new queueing-theoretic models to derive the maximum
throughput of sharded blockchains. We consider two cases, a fully sharded
blockchain and a computation sharding. In the former nodes are exclusive to
each shard in terms of their responsibilities, i.e., block production, relaying
and storage. In the latter though, only block production is exclusive and nodes
relay and store every piece of information. We model each with a queueing
network that exploits signals to account for block production as well as
multi-destination cross-shard transactions. We make sure quasi-reversibility
for every queue in our models is satisfied so that they fall into the category
of product-form queueing networks. We then obtain a closed-form solution for
the maximum stable throughput of these systems with respect to block size,
block rate, number of destinations in transactions and the number of shards.
Comparing the results obtained from the two introduced sharding systems, we
conclude that the extent of sharding in different domains plays a significant
role in scalability.

the forecasting models take a sequence of numerical values as input and yield

Transformer architecture, modified with multiple encoding mechanisms to
incorporate the context and semantics around the historical data. In this
paper, we approach representation learning of time-series from the paradigm of
prompt-based natural language modeling. Inspired by the successes of
pre-trained language foundation models, we pose a question about whether these
models can also be adapted to solve time-series forecasting. Thus, we propose a
new forecasting paradigm: prompt-based time series forecasting (PromptCast). In
this novel task, the numerical input and output are transformed into prompts.
We frame the forecasting task in a sentence-to-sentence manner which makes it
possible to directly apply language models for forecasting purposes. To support
and facilitate the research of this task, we also present a large-scale dataset
(PISA) that includes three real-world forecasting scenarios. We evaluate
different SOTA numerical-based forecasting methods and language generation
models such as Bart. The benchmark results with single- and multi-step
forecasting settings demonstrate that the proposed prompt-based time series
forecasting with language generation models is a promising research direction.
In addition, in comparison to conventional numerical-based forecasting,
PromptCast shows a much better generalization ability under the zero-shot
setting. We believe that the proposed PromptCast task as well as our PISA
dataset could provide novel insights and further lead to new research
directions in the domain of time-series representation learning and
forecasting.
