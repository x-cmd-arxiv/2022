turning sensor inputs (i.e., images) captured in an adverse condition into a
benign one (i.e., sunny), upon which the downstream tasks (e.g., semantic
segmentation) can attain high accuracy. Prior work primarily formulates this as
an unpaired image-to-image translation problem due to the lack of paired images
captured under the exact same camera poses and semantic layouts. While
perfectly-aligned images are not available, one can easily obtain
coarsely-paired images. For instance, many people drive the same routes daily
in both good and adverse weather; thus, images captured at close-by GPS
locations can form a pair. Though data from repeated traversals are unlikely to
capture the same foreground objects, we posit that they provide rich contextual
information to supervise the image translation model. To this end, we propose a
novel training objective leveraging coarsely-aligned image pairs. We show that
our coarsely-aligned training scheme leads to a better image translation
quality and improved downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation, monocular
depth estimation, and visual localization.

can be inferred from precise observations and modelling of their X-ray light
curves. In the present study, we model the thermal X-ray signals originated in
MSPs, all the way from numerically solving the surrounding magnetospheres up to
the ray tracing of the emitted photons and the final computation of their light
curves and spectra. Our modelled X-ray signals are then compared against a set
of very accurate NICER observations of four target pulsars: PSR J0437-4715, PSR
J1231-1411, PSR J2124-3358 and PSR J0030+0451. We find very good simultaneous
fits for the light curve and spectral distribution in all these pulsars. The
magnetosphere is solved by performing general relativistic force-free
simulations of a rotating neutron star (NS) endowed with a simple centered
dipolar magnetic field, for many different stellar compactness and pulsar
misalignments. From these solutions, we derive an emissivity map over the
surface of the star, which is based on the electric currents in the
magnetosphere. In particular, the emission regions (ERs) are determined in this
model by spacelike four-currents that reach the NS. We show that this
assumption, together with the inclusion of the gravitational curvature on the
force-free simulations, lead to non-standard ERs facing the closed-zone of the
pulsar, in addition to other ERs within the polar caps. The combined X-ray
signals from these two kinds of ERs (both antipodal) allow to approximate the
non-trivial interpulses found in all the target MSPs light curves.

  Conference on Robotics and Automation 2023 (ICRA 2023)",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Recently neural scene representations have provided very impressive results
for representing 3D scenes visually, however, their study and progress have
mainly been limited to visualization of virtual models in computer graphics or
scene reconstruction in computer vision without explicitly accounting for
sensor and pose uncertainty. Using this novel scene representation in robotics
applications, however, would require accounting for this uncertainty in the
neural map. The aim of this paper is therefore to propose a novel method for
training {\em probabilistic neural scene representations} with uncertain
training data that could enable the inclusion of these representations in
robotics applications. Acquiring images using cameras or depth sensors contains
inherent uncertainty, and furthermore, the camera poses used for learning a 3D
model are also imperfect. If these measurements are used for training without
accounting for their uncertainty, then the resulting models are non-optimal,
and the resulting scene representations are likely to contain artifacts such as
blur and un-even geometry. In this work, the problem of uncertainty integration
to the learning process is investigated by focusing on training with uncertain
information in a probabilistic manner. The proposed method involves explicitly
augmenting the training likelihood with an uncertainty term such that the
learnt probability distribution of the network is minimized with respect to the
training uncertainty. It will be shown that this leads to more accurate image
rendering quality, in addition to more precise and consistent geometry.
Validation has been carried out on both synthetic and real datasets showing
that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results
show notably that the proposed method is capable of rendering novel
high-quality views even when the training data is limited.

observed approaching 20~K from above, while for a few branches a weak softening
is visible upon further cooling to 2~K. The observed dispersion relations of

measuring the 2D momentum distribution of photoelectrons generated by strong
laser fields. There has been continued interest in expanding it into 3D
measurements either through reconstructive or direct methods. Recently much
work has been devoted to the latter of these, particularly by relating the
electron time-of-flight (TOF) to the third momentum component. The technical
challenge here is having timing resolution sufficient to resolve structure in
the narrow (< 10 ns) electron TOF spread. Here we build upon work in the fields
of VMI lens design and 3D VMI measurement by using a plano-convex thick-lens
VMI in conjunction with an event-driven camera (TPX3CAM) providing TOF
information for high resolution 3D electron momentum measurements. We perform
simulations to show that, with the addition of a mesh electrode to the
thick-lens VMI geometry, a plano-convex electrostatic field is formed which
extends the detectable electron cutoff energy range while retaining high
resolution. Further, the thick-lens also extends the electron TOF range which
allows for better resolution of the momentum along this axis. We experimentally
demonstrate these capabilities by examining above-threshold ionization in Xenon
where the apparatus is shown to collect electrons of energy up to $\sim$7 eV
with a TOF spread of $\sim$30 ns, both of which are improvements on previous
work by factors of $\sim$1.4 and $\sim$3.75 respectively. Finally, the PCTL-VMI
is equipped with a coincident ion TOF spectrometer which is shown to
effectively extract unique 3D momentum distributions for different ionic
species within a gas mixture. These techniques have potential to lend
themselves to more advanced measurements, particularly involving systems where
the electron momentum distributions possess non-trivial symmetries and require
high resolution.

standard two-dimensional panel methods when the structure of the interactive

us to shed light on the mechanism of PL modulation in monolayer WS2. We have

are several other unwanted signals as well as instrumental noise, contaminating
the target signal. There are many component separation methods to reconstruct
signals. Here, we used just three blind methods (FastICA, GNILC and GMCA),

trials with time to event outcomes. Under NPH, the hazard ratio does not stay
constant over time and the log-rank test is no longer the most powerful test.
The weighted log-rank test (WLRT) has been introduced to deal with the presence
of non-proportionality. We focus our attention on the WLRT and the
complementary Cox model based on the time-varying treatment effect proposed by
Lin and Le\'on (2017) (doi: 10.1016/j.conctc.2017.09.004). We will investigate
whether the proposed weighted hazard ratio (WHR) approach is unbiased in
scenarios where the WLRT statistic is the most powerful test. In the
diminishing treatment effect scenario where the WLRT statistic would be most
optimal, the time-varying treatment effect estimated by the Cox model estimates
the treatment effect very close to the true one. However, when the true hazard
ratio is large we note that the proposed model overestimates the treatment
effect and the treatment profile over time. However, in the delayed treatment
scenario, the estimated treatment effect profile over time is typically close
to the true profile. For both scenarios, we have demonstrated analytically that
the hazard ratio functions are approximately equal under certain constraints.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that in certain scenarios where a given
WLRT would be most powerful, we observe that the WHR from the corresponding Cox

proposed system takes advantage of a wider field of view (fov) of the camera as
well as the stochastic nature of the object detection algorithms to guide the
miniUGV in the hidden space to find the object. Upon finding the object the
miniUGV grabs it using visual servoing and then returns back to its start point
from where the UAV retracts it back and transports the object to a safe place.
In case there is no object found in the hidden space, UAV continues the aerial
search. The tethered miniUGV gives the UAV an ability to act beyond its reach

any of the robots individually. The system has a wide range of applications and

difficult task. Most algorithms used for this purpose can be classified into
two broad categories: distance-based or model-based approaches. Distance-based
approaches typically utilize a distance function between pairs of data objects
and group similar objects together into clusters. Model-based approaches are
based on using the mixture-modeling framework. Compared to distance-based
approaches, model-based approaches offer better interpretability because each
cluster can be explicitly characterized in terms of the proposed model.
However, these models present a particular difficulty in identifying a correct
multivariate distribution that a mixture can be based upon. In this manuscript,
we review some of the approaches used to select a distribution for the needed
mixture model first. Then, we propose avoiding this problem altogether by using
a nonparametric MSL (Maximum Smoothed Likelihood) algorithm. This algorithm was
proposed earlier in statistical literature but has not been, to the best of our
knowledge, applied to transcriptomics data. The salient feature of this
approach is that it avoids explicit specification of distributions of
individual biological samples altogether, thus making the task of a
practitioner easier. When used on a real dataset, the algorithm produces a
large number of biologically meaningful clusters and compares favorably to the
two other mixture-based algorithms commonly used for RNA-seq data clustering.

training. The model corrupted in this way functions normally, but when

Existing defenses usually rely on the assumption of the universal backdoor
setting in which poisoned samples share the same uniform trigger. However,
recent advanced backdoor attacks show that this assumption is no longer valid
in dynamic backdoors where the triggers vary from input to input, thereby
defeating the existing defenses.
  In this work, we propose a novel technique, Beatrix (backdoor detection via
Gram matrix). Beatrix utilizes Gram matrix to capture not only the feature
correlations but also the appropriately high-order information of the
representations. By learning class-conditional statistics from activation
patterns of normal samples, Beatrix can identify poisoned samples by capturing
the anomalies in activation patterns. To further improve the performance in
identifying target labels, Beatrix leverages kernel-based testing without
making any prior assumptions on representation distribution. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through extensive evaluation and comparison with
state-of-the-art defensive techniques. The experimental results show that our
approach achieves an F1 score of 91.1% in detecting dynamic backdoors, while
the state of the art can only reach 36.9%.

attainment of field strengths approaching the Schwinger critical field

dependent on behavior ID features, which are learned based on the historical
user-ad interactions. Nevertheless, behavior ID features relying on historical
user behaviors are not feasible to describe new ads without previous
interactions with users. To overcome the limitations of behavior ID features in
modeling new ads, we exploit the visual content in ads to boost the performance
of CTR prediction models. Specifically, we map each ad into a set of visual IDs
based on its visual content. These visual IDs are further used for generating
the visual embedding for enhancing CTR prediction models. We formulate the
learning of visual IDs into a supervised quantization problem. Due to a lack of
class labels for commercial images in advertisements, we exploit image textual
descriptions as the supervision to optimize the image extractor for generating
effective visual IDs. Meanwhile, since the hard quantization is
non-differentiable, we soften the quantization operation to make it support the
end-to-end network training. After mapping each image into visual IDs, we learn
the embedding for each visual ID based on the historical user-ad interactions
accumulated in the past. Since the visual ID embedding depends only on the
visual content, it generalizes well to new ads. Meanwhile, the visual ID
embedding complements the ad behavior ID embedding. Thus, it can considerably
boost the performance of the CTR prediction models previously relying on
behavior ID features for both new ads and ads that have accumulated rich user
behaviors. After incorporating the visual ID embedding in the CTR prediction
model of Baidu online advertising, the average CTR of ads improves by 1.46%,
and the total charge increases by 1.10%.

Starting from stochastic orders, specifically, likelihood ratio dominance, that
obtain for resulting distributions of posteriors, we consider monotonicity
properties of the posterior probabilities as a function of the sample size when
data arrive sequentially. While the $\theta_{0}$-posterior is monotonically
increasing (i.e., it is a submartingale) when the data are generated under that
same $\theta_{0}$, it need not be monotonically decreasing in general, not even
in terms of its overall expectation, when the data are generated under a
different $\theta_{1}.$ In fact, it may keep going up and down many times, even
in simple cases such as iid coin tosses. We obtain precise asymptotic rates
when the data come from the wide class of exponential families of
distributions; these rates imply in particular that the expectation of the
$\theta_{0}$-posterior under $\theta_{1}\neq\theta_{0}$ is eventually strictly
decreasing. Finally, we show that in a number of interesting cases this
expectation is a log-concave function of the sample size, and thus unimodal. In
the Bernoulli case we obtain this by developing an inequality that is related

observed, which is currently prohibited in most semi-supervised methods, 2)
takes unaligned sequences as input and thus, allows learning for widely diverse

Gelfand--Tsetlin patterns, and describe the set of all ergodic central measures

that an ergodic central measure on a subgraph of a Pascal-type graph can often
be obtained as the restriction of the standard Bernoulli measure to the path
space of the subgraph. This observation dramatically changes the approach to
finding central measures also on discrete graphs, such as the famous Young
graph.
  The simplest example of this type is given by the theorem on the weak limits
of normalized Lebesgue measures on simplices; these are the so-called Ces\`aro
measures, which are concentrated on the sequences with prescribed Ces\`aro
limits (this limit parametrizes the corresponding measure).
  More complicated examples are the graphs of continuous Young diagrams with
fixed number of rows and the graphs of spectra of infinite Hermitian matrices
of finite rank. We prove existence and uniqueness theorems for ergodic central
measures and describe their structure. In particular, our results 1) give a new
spectral description of the so-called infinite-dimensional Wishart
measures~\cite{W}~ -- ergodic unitarily invariant measures of discrete type on
the set of infinite Hermitian matrices; 2) describe the structure of continuous
analogs of measures on discrete graded graphs.

study of (well-separated) completely semidistributive lattices. Such lattices
come equipped with a bijection between their completely join-irreducible and
completely meet-irreducible elements, known as rowmotion or simply the
""$\kappa$-map"". Generalizing known results for finite semidistributive
lattices, we show that the $\kappa$-map determines exactly when a set of
completely join-irreducible elements forms a ""canonical join representation"". A
consequence is that the corresponding ""canonical join complex"" is a flag
simplicial complex, as has been shown for finite semidistributive lattices and
lattices of torsion classes of finite-dimensional algebras. Finally, in the

demonstrate how Jasso's $\tau$-tilting reduction can be encoded using the

and (ii) their Doppler shifts, by introducing a new method that exploits the
very high spectral resolution of our observations. We confirm a previous
detection of FeI emission and demonstrate a combined precision of 0.5 km s-1 on
the orbital properties of KELT-9b. By studying the phase-resolved Doppler shift
of FeI lines, we detect an anomaly in the planet's orbital radial velocity
well-fitted with a slightly eccentric orbit (e = 0.016$\pm$0.003, w =
150$^{+13\circ}_{-11},~5\sigma$ preference). However, we argue that such
anomaly can be explained by a day-night wind of a few km s-1 blowing neutral
iron gas. Additionally, we find that the FeI emission line depths are symmetric
around the substellar point within 10 deg ($2\sigma$). We show that these
results are qualitatively compatible with predictions from general circulation
models for ultra-hot Jupiter planets. Very high-resolution spectroscopy phase
curves have the sensitivity to reveal a phase dependence in both the line
depths and their Doppler shifts throughout the orbit. They are highly

jigsaw puzzle, one can reliably self-assemble arbitrary structures if all the

Combining experiments, simulations, and theory, we show that designing the

fMRI dataset of human brain responses elicited by complex natural scenes. Using
semantic embeddings obtained by applying linguistic deep learning models to
human-generated scene descriptions, we identify a widely distributed network of
brain regions that encode semantic scene descriptions. Importantly, these
semantic embeddings better explain activity in these regions than traditional
object category labels. In addition, they are effective predictors of activity
despite the fact that the participants did not actively engage in a semantic
task, suggesting that visuo-semantic transformations are a default mode of
vision. In support of this view, we then show that highly accurate
reconstructions of scene captions can be directly linearly decoded from
patterns of brain activity. Finally, a recurrent convolutional neural network
trained on semantic embeddings further outperforms semantic embeddings in
predicting brain activity, providing a mechanistic model of the brain's
visuo-semantic transformations. Together, these experimental and computational
results suggest that transforming visual input into rich semantic scene

depending on the configuration of the system, electrons can rotate in two

  No-Regret, PAC, and Reward-Free Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI math.ST stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Finding unified complexity measures and algorithms for sample-efficient
learning is a central topic of research in reinforcement learning (RL). The
Decision-Estimation Coefficient (DEC) is recently proposed by Foster et al.
(2021) as a necessary and sufficient complexity measure for sample-efficient
no-regret RL. This paper makes progress towards a unified theory for RL with
the DEC framework. First, we propose two new DEC-type complexity measures:
Explorative DEC (EDEC), and Reward-Free DEC (RFDEC). We show that they are
necessary and sufficient for sample-efficient PAC learning and reward-free
learning, thereby extending the original DEC which only captures no-regret
learning. Next, we design new unified sample-efficient algorithms for all three
learning goals. Our algorithms instantiate variants of the
Estimation-To-Decisions (E2D) meta-algorithm with a strong and general model
estimation subroutine. Even in the no-regret setting, our algorithm E2D-TA
improves upon the algorithms of Foster et al. (2021) which require either
bounding a variant of the DEC which may be prohibitively large, or designing
problem-specific estimation subroutines. As applications, we recover existing
and obtain new sample-efficient learning results for a wide range of tractable
RL problems using essentially a single algorithm. We also generalize the DEC to
give sample-efficient algorithms for all-policy model estimation, with
applications for learning equilibria in Markov Games. Finally, as a connection,
we re-analyze two existing optimistic model-based algorithms based on Posterior
Sampling or Maximum Likelihood Estimation, showing that they enjoy similar
regret bounds as E2D-TA under similar structural conditions as the DEC.

novel transport behaviour, which is absent in the static regimes. Here we
consider a quantum pumping protocol, such that the quasiparticles of
Weyl/multi-Weyl and nodal-line semimetals are subjected to a time-periodic
rectangular potential well. The presence of an oscillating potential of
frequency $\omega$ creates equispaced Floquet side-bands with spacing $\hbar
\omega$. As a result, a Fano resonance is observed when the difference in the
Fermi energy (i.e., the energy of the incident quasiparticle), and the energy
of one of the (quasi)bound state levels of the well, coincides with the energy
of an integer number of photons (each carrying energy quantum $\hbar \omega$,
equal to the side-band spacing). Using the Floquet theory and the scattering
matrix approach, in the zero-temperature non-adiabatic pumping limit, we find
characteristic Fano resonance patterns in the transmission coefficients, which
depend on the nature of the dispersion. The inflection points in the pumped
shot noise spectra also serve as a proxy for the corresponding Fano resonances.
Therefore, we also numerically evaluate the pumped shot noise. Finally, we
correlate the existence of the Fano resonance points to the (quasi)bound states
of the well, by explicitly calculating the bound states of the static well
(which are a subset of the bound states of the driven system). Since we
consider semimetals with anisotropic dispersions, all the features observed
depend on the orientation of the potential well. We believe that our results
will serve as a guide for future experiments investigating quantum transmission
in nonequilibrium settings.

robots remains mainly a manual task. We seek to provide design tools to
automate the design of robots themselves. An important challenge in robot
design automation is the large and complex design search space which grows
exponentially with the number of components, making optimization difficult and
sample inefficient. In this work, we present Grammar-guided Latent Space
Optimization (GLSO), a framework that transforms design automation into a
low-dimensional continuous optimization problem by training a graph variational
autoencoder (VAE) to learn a mapping between the graph-structured design space
and a continuous latent space. This transformation allows optimization to be
conducted in a continuous latent space, where sample efficiency can be
significantly boosted by applying algorithms such as Bayesian Optimization.
GLSO guides training of the VAE using graph grammar rules and robot world space
features, such that the learned latent space focus on valid robots and is
easier for the optimization algorithm to explore. Importantly, the trained VAE
can be reused to search for designs specialized to multiple different tasks
without retraining. We evaluate GLSO by designing robots for a set of
locomotion tasks in simulation, and demonstrate that our method outperforms
related state-of-the-art robot design automation methods.

micro-scale and then validating them using meso-scale experimental results. The
advent of Machine Learning (ML) and AI in recent years has provided an
opportunity to construct quick surrogate ML models to replace high fidelity
multi-physics models, which have a high computational cost and may not be
applicable for high nonlinear equations. This serves as the motivation for the
introduction of innovative Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) to simulate
multiple stiff, and semi-stiff ODEs that govern Pyrolysis and Ablation. Our
Engine is particularly developed to calculate the char formation and degree of
burning in the course of pyrolysis of crosslinked polymeric systems. A
multi-task learning approach is hired to assure the best fitting to the

finite element high fidelity solutions on different examples. We developed PINN

two-dimensional examples. By decoupling thermal and mechanical equations, we
can predict the loss of performance in the system by predicting the char

asymptotic average injective norm is known analytically. Having established
that our proposed normalized gradient descent algorithm generally performs
best, we then use it to provide approximate numerical values for the average

that there are many diverse and unique retrieval tasks, each targeting
different search intents, queries, and search domains. In this paper, we
suggest to work on Few-shot Dense Retrieval, a setting where each task comes
with a short description and a few examples. To amplify the power of a few
examples, we propose Prompt-base Query Generation for Retriever (Promptagator),
which leverages large language models (LLM) as a few-shot query generator, and
creates task-specific retrievers based on the generated data. Powered by LLM's
generalization ability, Promptagator makes it possible to create task-specific
end-to-end retrievers solely based on a few examples {without} using Natural

Surprisingly, LLM prompting with no more than 8 examples allows dual encoders
to outperform heavily engineered models trained on MS MARCO like ColBERT v2 by
more than 1.2 nDCG on average on 11 retrieval sets. Further training
standard-size re-rankers using the same generated data yields another 5.0 point

due to a combination of tidal stripping in all dwarfs plus a stochastic

of galaxy clusters, and thus on the derived cluster masses. Using new
information on their structural parameters (from HST imaging) and kinematics
(from MUSE data), we build the Fundamental Plane (FP) for the early-type
galaxies of the cluster Abell S1063. We take advantage of the calibrated FP to
develop an improved SL model of the total mass of the cluster core. The new
method allows us to obtain more accurate and complex relations between the
observables describing cluster members, and to completely fix their mass from
their observed magnitudes and effective radii. Compared to the power-law
approach, we find a different relation between the mass and the velocity
dispersion of members, which shows a significant scatter. Thanks to a new
estimate of the stellar mass of the cluster members from HST data, we measure
the cumulative projected mass profiles out to a radius of 350 kpc, for all
baryonic and DM components of the cluster. Finally, we compare the physical
properties of the sub-haloes in our model and those predicted by
high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations. We obtain compatible results in
terms of the stellar-over-total mass fraction of the members. On the other
hand, we confirm the recently reported discrepancy in terms of sub-halo
compactness: at a fixed total mass value, simulated sub-haloes are less compact
than what our SL model predicts.

ratio for our resulting chemical abundances. The derived iron abundance is
sub-solar with [Fe/H] = $-0.74\pm0.05$. In relation to the scaled solar

$\text{[<Mg,Si,Ca,Ti>/Fe]}=+0.25\pm$0.11, with a particularly high Ti abundance
of +0.49$\pm$0.05. Other super-solar elements include

from evolving stars. Almost half of these quiescent systems today have gas
masses much smaller than that expected for their mass. We find that
gas-deficient galaxies originate from 1) past interactions with massive hosts,
in which a dwarf loses gas and dark matter via tidal and ram-pressure forces;
and 2) from hydrodynamic interactions with the gaseous filaments and sheets of
the cosmic web, in which a dwarf loses gas via ram-pressure. We refer to these
systems as ``flybys'' and ``COSWEBs''. Flybys locate in high-density regions,
tracing the location of the most massive galaxies in the simulation. In
contrast, COSWEBs are dispersed throughout the volume and trace the cosmic web.
For sub-critical systems, $M_{200} < M_{\rm crit}$, the fraction of COSWEB
galaxies can be as high as $35 \%$, and much higher for flybys, which make up
100 per cent of the galaxies with $M_{200}<3\times 10^8 \ \rm M_{\odot}$. The
deficit of gas caused by these mechanisms may preclude the detection of a large
fraction of field dwarfs in future HI surveys. For galaxies inhabiting halos

problems with these (and revisiting key criticisms raised by other authors). I
then show that all these problems can be resolved by reformulating macrorealism
within the framework of generalized probabilistic theories. In particular, I
argue that a theory should be considered to be macrorealist if and only if it
describes every macroscopic system by a strictly classical (i.e., simplicial)
generalized probabilistic theory. This approach brings significant clarity and
precision to our understanding of macrorealism, and provides us with a host of
new tools -- both conceptual and technical -- for studying macrorealism. I
leverage this approach i) to clarify in what sense macrorealism is a notion of
classicality, ii) to propose a new test of macrorealism that is maximally
informative and theory-independent (unlike all prior tests of macrorealism),
and iii) to show that every proof of generalized contextuality on a macroscopic
system implies the failure of macrorealism.

formation histories of a complete sample of 332 massive galaxies
($\mathrm{>10^{10}M_{\odot}}$) at redshift $1\leq z \leq 1.5$ in the GOODS-N
field. We find that massive galaxies in this redshift range avoid the lowest
density environments. Moreover, we observed that the oldest galaxies in our
sample with with mass-weighted formation redshift $\mathrm{\overline{z}_{M-w}

environments. Younger galaxies, including those with active star formation,
tend to live in denser environments ($\Sigma = \mathrm{5.0_{1.1}^{24.8}\times

galaxies starting their formation first would merge with neighbors and sweep
their environment earlier. On the other hand, galaxies formed more recently
($\overline{z}_{M-w} < 2.5$) are accreted into large scale structures at later
times and we are observing them before sweeping their environment or,
alternatively, they are less likely to affect their environment. However, given
that both number and mass surface densities of neighbor galaxies is relatively
low for the oldest galaxies, our results reveal a very weak correlation between
environment and the first formation stages of the earliest massive galaxies.

localization-free and metric-free autonomous exploration using a group of
sensing-limited and communication-limited robots in a GPS-denied environment.
To ensure rapid and complete exploration, existing works make assumptions on
the density and distribution of landmarks in the environment. These assumptions
may be overly restrictive, especially in hazardous environments where landmarks
may be destroyed or completely missing. In this paper, we first propose a deep
reinforcement learning framework for multi-agent cooperative exploration in
environments with sparse landmarks while reducing client-server communication.
By leveraging recent development on partial observability and credit
assignment, our framework can train the exploration policy efficiently for
multi-robot systems. The policy receives individual rewards from actions based
on a proximity sensor with limited range and resolution, which is combined with
group rewards to encourage collaborative exploration and construction of the
Landmark Complex through observation of 0-, 1- and 2-dimensional simplices. In
addition, we employ a three-stage curriculum learning strategy to mitigate the
reward sparsity by gradually adding random obstacles and destroying random
landmarks. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that our method outperforms
the state-of-the-art landmark complex exploration method in efficiency among
different environments with sparse landmarks.

computer vision. Recently, many existing works focus on training various
descriptor learning networks by minimizing a triplet loss (or its variants),
which is expected to decrease the distance between each positive pair and
increase the distance between each negative pair. However, such an expectation
has to be lowered due to the non-perfect convergence of network optimizer to a
local solution. Addressing this problem and the open computational speed
problem, we propose a Descriptor Distillation framework for local descriptor
learning, called DesDis, where a student model gains knowledge from a
pre-trained teacher model, and it is further enhanced via a designed
teacher-student regularizer. This teacher-student regularizer is to constrain
the difference between the positive (also negative) pair similarity from the
teacher model and that from the student model, and we theoretically prove that
a more effective student model could be trained by minimizing a weighted
combination of the triplet loss and this regularizer, than its teacher which is
trained by minimizing the triplet loss singly. Under the proposed DesDis, many
existing descriptor networks could be embedded as the teacher model, and
accordingly, both equal-weight and light-weight student models could be
derived, which outperform their teacher in either accuracy or speed.
Experimental results on 3 public datasets demonstrate that the equal-weight
student models, derived from the proposed DesDis framework by utilizing three
typical descriptor learning networks as teacher models, could achieve
significantly better performances than their teachers and several other
comparative methods. In addition, the derived light-weight models could achieve
8 times or even faster speeds than the comparative methods under similar patch

Observations with MeerKAT and, in future, the SKA can greatly improve the

better measurement of Shapiro delay parameter s and improved mass measurements

confirmation of the NLO signal propagation effects and already surpass the
previous measurement from 16-yr data by a factor of 1.65. These effects include
the retardation effect due to the movement of B and the deflection of the
signal by the gravitational field of B. We also investigate novel effects which
are expected. For instance, we search for potential profile variations near
superior conjunctions caused by shifts of the line-of-sight due to latitudinal
signal deflection and find insignificant evidence with our current data. With
simulations, we find that the latitudinal deflection delay is unlikely to be
measured with timing because of its correlation with Shapiro delay.
Furthermore, although it is currently not possible to detect the expected
lensing correction to the Shapiro delay, our simulations suggest that this
effect may be measured with the full SKA. Finally, we provide an improved
analytical description for the signal propagation in the Double Pulsar system

  Decision-Making",,,,,"cs.HC cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Proponents of explainable AI have often argued that it constitutes an
essential path towards algorithmic fairness. Prior works examining these claims
have primarily evaluated explanations based on their effects on humans'
perceptions, but there is scant research on the relationship between
explanations and distributive fairness of AI-assisted decisions. In this paper,
we conduct an empirical study to examine the relationship between feature-based
explanations and distributive fairness, mediated by human perceptions and
reliance on AI recommendations. Our findings show that explanations influence
fairness perceptions, which, in turn, relate to humans' tendency to adhere to
AI recommendations. However, our findings suggest that such explanations do not
enable humans to discern correct and wrong AI recommendations. Instead, we show
that they may affect reliance irrespective of the correctness of AI
recommendations. Depending on which features an explanation highlights, this
can foster or hinder distributive fairness: when explanations highlight
features that are task-irrelevant and evidently associated with the sensitive
attribute, this prompts overrides that counter stereotype-aligned AI
recommendations. Meanwhile, if explanations appear task-relevant, this induces
reliance behavior that reinforces stereotype-aligned errors. These results show
that feature-based explanations are not a reliable mechanism to improve
distributive fairness, as their ability to do so relies on a human-in-the-loop
operationalization of the flawed notion of ""fairness through unawareness"".
Finally, our study design provides a blueprint to evaluate the suitability of
other explanations as pathways towards improved distributive fairness of
AI-assisted decisions.

GPU-accelerated open source Python package MPoL to explore the influence of
various RML prior distributions (maximum entropy, sparsity, total variation,
and total squared variation) on images reconstructed from ALMA continuum
observations of the protoplanetary disk hosted by HD 143006. We developed a
K-fold process for the image validation procedure cross-validation (CV) and
explored both uniform and ""dartboard"" styles of visibility sampling within the
validation process. Using CV to find optimal hyperparameter values for the test
case of total squared variation regularization, we discovered that a wide range
of hyperparameter values (spanning roughly an order of magnitude) correspond to
models with strong predictive power for visibilities across unsampled or
sparsely sampled spatial frequencies. We also provide a comparison of RML and
CLEAN images for the protoplanetary disk around HD 143006, finding that RML
imaging improves the spatial resolution of the image by about a factor of 3.
Lastly, we distill general recommendations for building an RML workflow for
image synthesis of ALMA protoplanetary disk observations, including
recommendations for incorporating CV most effectively. Using RML methods to
improve the resolution of protoplanetary disk observations will enable new
science requiring high resolution images, including the detection of
protoplanets embedded within disks.

of two black holes depends exclusively on the mass ratio and spins of the
coalescing black holes, and on the eccentricity of the binary. If matter is
present, accretion by the merging black holes may modify significantly their
masses and spins, altering both the dynamics of the binary and the
gravitational recoil of the remnant black hole. This paper considers such
scenario. We investigate the effects on the kick of the final black hole from
immersing the binary in a scalar field cloud. We consider two types of
configurations: one with non-spinning and unequal-mass black holes, and a
second with equal mass and spinning holes. For both types, we investigate how
the gravitational recoil of the final black hole changes as we vary the energy
density of the scalar field. We find that the accretion of scalar field by the
merging black holes could have a profound effect. For the non-spinning,
unequal-mass binary black holes, the kicks are in general larger than in the
vacuum case, with speeds of approximately 1,200 km/s for binaries with mass
ratio 2:1, one order of magnitude larger than in vacuum. For equal mass,
binaries with black holes with spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum,
kicks larger than in vacuum are also found. For systems with spins in the
super-kick configuration, the scalar field triggers a similar dependence of the
kicks with the entrance angle at merger as in the vacuum case but in this case
depending on the strength of the scalar field.

processes necessitates the characterization of the forces between charged
macromolecules beyond the point-ion description. From the field theoretic
partition function of an electrolyte confined between two anionic membranes, we
derive a contact-value identity valid for general intramolecular solute
structure and electrostatic coupling strength. In the electrostatic mean-field
(MF) regime, the inner charge spread of the solute particles is shown to induce
the twofold enhancement of the short-range Poisson-Boltzmann (PB)-level
membrane repulsion, and a longer-range depletion attraction. Our contact
theorem indicates that the twofold repulsion enhancement by solute size is
equally present in the opposite strong-coupling (SC) regime of linear and
spherical solute molecules. Upon the inclusion of the dielectric contrast
between the electrolyte and the interacting membranes, the emerging
polarization forces substantially amplify the solute specificity of the
macromolecular interactions. Namely, the finite size of the solute particles
composed of similar terminal charges such as putrescine molecules weaken the
intermembrane repulsion. However, the extended structure of the solute
molecules carrying opposite elementary charges such as ionized atoms and
zwitterionic molecules enhance the membrane repulsion by several factors. We
also show that these polarization forces can extend the range of the solute
structure effects up to intermembrane distances exceeding the solute size by an
order of magnitude. This radical alteration of the intermembrane interactions
by the salt structure identifies the solute specificity as a key ingredient of
the thermodynamic stability in colloidal systems.

learn shared representations of diverse item attributes. During inference, new

attributes they share with items previously observed during training, and thus
will have similar representations with those items, enabling recommendations of
even cold-start and sparse items. Additionally, M2TRec is trained in a
multi-task setting to predict the next item in the session along with its
primary category and subcategories. Our multi-task strategy makes the model

absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) and a multidimensional linear regression
algorithm are employed to enable interference-free measurements of the target
species. The laser wavelength was tuned over 673.8-675.1 cm-1 by a sine-wave
injection current (1 kHz scan rate). Minimum detection limits of 0.11, 4.16,
and 2.96 ppm were achieved for benzene, acetylene, and carbon dioxide,
respectively. The developed sensor is insensitive to interference from
overlapping absorbance spectra, and its performance was demonstrated by
measuring known mixture samples prepared in the lab. The sensor can be used to
detect tiny leaks of the target species in petrochemical facilities and to
monitor air quality in residential and industrial areas.

engineering electronic and optical properties through strain control because of
their extremely high mechanical elasticity and sensitive dependence of material
properties on mechanical strain. In this paper, a combined experimental and
theoretical effort is made to investigate the effects of mechanical strain on
various spectral features of bilayer MoTe2 photoluminescence (PL). We found
that bilayer MoTe2 can be converted from an indirect-to direct-bandgap material
through strain engineering, resulting in a photoluminescence enhancement by a
factor of 2.24. Over 90% of the PL comes from photons emitted by the direct
excitons at the maximum strain applied. Importantly, we show that strain
effects lead to a reduction of the overall linewidth of PL by as much as 36.6%.
We attribute the dramatic decrease of linewidth to a strain-induced complex
interplay among various excitonic varieties such as direct bright excitons,
trions, and indirect excitons. Our experimental results on direct and indirect
exciton emission features are explained by theoretical exciton energies that
are based on first-principle electronic band structure calculations. The
consistent theory-experimental trend shows that the enhancement of PL and the
reduction of linewidth are the consequences of the increasing direct exciton
contribution with the increase of strain. Our results demonstrate that strain
engineering can lead to a PL quality of the bilayer MoTe2 comparable to that of
the monolayer counterpart. The additional benefit of a longer emission
wavelength makes the bilayer MoTe2 more suitable for Silicon-photonics
integration due to the reduced Silicon absorption.

these claims, we derive the estimands obtained from the difference-in-means
estimator in a matched-pair design both when the observations from pairs with
an attrited unit are retained and when they are dropped. We find limited
evidence to support the claims that dropping pairs helps recover the average
treatment effect, but we find that it may potentially help in recovering a
convex weighted average of conditional average treatment effects. We report
similar findings for stratified designs when studying the estimands obtained
from a regression of outcomes on treatment with and without strata fixed

(FL) is an ML paradigm where the training is performed locally on the users'

privacy leaks can still occur. For instance, an attacker accessing the final
trained model can successfully perform unwanted inference of the data belonging
to the users who participated in the training process. In this paper, we
propose a privacy-preserving FL framework for online content moderation that
incorporates Differential Privacy (DP). To demonstrate the feasibility of our
approach, we focus on detecting harmful content on Twitter - but the overall
concept can be generalized to other types of misbehavior. We simulate a text
classifier - in FL fashion - which can detect tweets with harmful content. We
show that the performance of the proposed FL framework can be close to the
centralized approach - for both the DP and non-DP FL versions. Moreover, it has
a high performance even if a small number of clients (each with a small number
of data points) are available for the FL training. When reducing the number of
clients (from 50 to 10) or the data points per client (from 1K to 0.1K), the
classifier can still achieve ~81% AUC. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation to
four other Twitter datasets that capture different types of user misbehavior
and still obtain a promising performance (61% - 80% AUC). Finally, we explore
the overhead on the users' devices during the FL training phase and show that
the local training does not introduce excessive CPU utilization and memory
consumption overhead.

electron injection, and electron transit-time Dto from hard X-ray (GRB) to
optical emitting energies, a (true) POC may appear during the GRB pulse (of
duration dtg) or after (delayed OC). The signature of counterparts arising from
the cooling of GRB electrons is that true POC pulses (Dto < dtg) last as long
as the corresponding GRB pulse (dto ~ dtg) while delayed OC pulses (Dto > dtg)
last as long as the transit-time (dto ~ Dto). If OC variability can be
measured, then another signature for this OC mechanism is that the GRB
variability is ""passed"" only to POCs but is lost for delayed OCs. Within the
GRB electron cooling model for counterparts, POCs should be on average dimmer
than delayed one (which is found to be consistent with the data), and harder
GRB low-energy slopes bLE should be associated more often with the dimmer POCs
The range of low-energy slopes bLE in [-1/2,1/3] produced by electron cooling
and the average burst brightness of 1 mJy (with 1 dex dispersion) imply that
POCs of hard GRBs can be dimmer than R=20 and difficult to detect by robotic
telescopes (unless there is another mechanism that overshines the emission from
cooling electrons) and that the POCs of soft GRBs can be brighter than R=10,

approach, optimization is applied to the equations of magnetohydrodynamic
equilibrium and quasisymmetry, expanded in the small distance from the magnetic
axis, as formulated by Garren and Boozer [Phys. Fluids B, 3, 2805 (1991)]. Due
to the reduction of the equations by the expansion, the computational cost is
significantly reduced, to times on the order of 1 cpu-second, enabling wide and
high-resolution scans over parameter space. In contrast to traditional
stellarator optimization, here the cost function serves to maximize the volume
in which the expansion is accurate. A key term in the cost function is $||
\nabla\mathbf B ||$, to maximize scale lengths in the field. Using this method,
a database of $5\times 10^5$ optimized configurations is calculated and
presented. Quasisymmetric configurations are observed to exist in continuous

radius. Several qualitatively new types of configuration are found, including
quasi-helically symmetric fields in which the number of field periods is two or

interest in population genetics. While the classical Moran model is formulated
for a well-mixed population, it has long been recognized that in real-world
applications, the population usually has an explicit spatial structure which
can significantly influence the dynamics. In the context of cancer initiation
in epithelial tissue, several recent works have analyzed the dynamics of
advantageous mutant spread on integer lattices, using the biased voter model
from particle systems theory. In this spatial version of the Moran model,
individuals first reproduce according to their fitness and then replace a
neighboring individual. From a biological standpoint, the opposite dynamics,
where individuals first die and are then replaced by a neighboring individual
according to its fitness, are equally relevant. Here, we investigate this
death-birth analogue of the biased voter model. We construct the process
mathematically, derive the associated dual process, establish bounds on the
survival probability of a single mutant, and prove that the process has an
asymptotic shape. We also briefly discuss alternative birth-death and
death-birth dynamics, depending on how the mutant fitness advantage affects the
dynamics. We show that birth-death and death-birth formulations of the biased
voter model are equivalent when fitness affects the former event of each update

with integrated spin quantum memories using diamond color center spin-photon
interfaces. However, this approach introduces a challenge in the microwave
control of individual spins within closely packed registers. Here, we present a
quantum-memory-integrated photonics platform capable of (i) the integration of
multiple diamond color center spins into a cryogenically compatible, high-speed
programmable PIC platform; (ii) selective manipulation of individual spin
qubits addressed via tunable magnetic field gradients; and (iii) simultaneous
control of multiple qubits using numerically optimized microwave pulse shaping.
The combination of localized optical control, enabled by the PIC platform,
together with selective spin manipulation opens the path to scalable quantum
networks on intra-chip and inter-chip platforms.

  How","Wide-Area Geolocalization with a Limited Field of View Camera","7 pages, 10 figures. Accepted to ICRA 2023",,,,"cs.RO cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cross-view geolocalization, a supplement or replacement for GPS, localizes an
agent within a search area by matching images taken from a ground-view camera
to overhead images taken from satellites or aircraft. Although the viewpoint
disparity between ground and overhead images makes cross-view geolocalization
challenging, significant progress has been made assuming that the ground agent
has access to a panoramic camera. For example, our prior work (WAG) introduced
changes in search area discretization, training loss, and particle filter
weighting that enabled city-scale panoramic cross-view geolocalization.
However, panoramic cameras are not widely used in existing robotic platforms
due to their complexity and cost. Non-panoramic cross-view geolocalization is
more applicable for robotics, but is also more challenging. This paper presents
Restricted FOV Wide-Area Geolocalization (ReWAG), a cross-view geolocalization
approach that generalizes WAG for use with standard, non-panoramic ground
cameras by creating pose-aware embeddings and providing a strategy to
incorporate particle pose into the Siamese network. ReWAG is a neural network
and particle filter system that is able to globally localize a mobile agent in
a GPS-denied environment with only odometry and a 90 degree FOV camera,
achieving similar localization accuracy as what WAG achieved with a panoramic
camera and improving localization accuracy by a factor of 100 compared to a
baseline vision transformer (ViT) approach. A video highlight that demonstrates
ReWAG's convergence on a test path of several dozen kilometers is available at

discovered from radio wavelengths to TeV gamma-rays, the majority of which were
first identified in radio or X-ray surveys. An increasing number of PWNe are
being identified in the TeV band by ground-based air Cherenkov Telescopes such
as HESS, MAGIC, and VERITAS such that they constitute the dominant source class
of Galactic TeV emitters. Combining available MeV-GeV data with observations in
the TeV band is critical for precise characterization of high-energy emission
from the relativistic particle population in PWNe, thus revealing the
capability to produce a significant fraction of the detected Galactic CR flux.
However, MeV-GeV PWN counterparts are still largely lacking even after 12 years
of continuous observation of the entire sky. Less than a dozen PWNe are
currently identified by the Fermi-LAT in the MeV-GeV band. Most PWNe are
located along the Galactic plane embedded within the prominent, diffuse
Galactic gamma-ray emission, which makes these sources difficult to disentangle
from the bright diffuse background. We present a systematic search for
gamma-ray counterparts to known PWNe in the 300MeV - 2TeV energy band using
11.5 years of Fermi-LAT data. For the first part of this search, we target the
locations of PWNe previously identified across the electromagnetic spectrum
that are not powered by pulsars previously detected by the Fermi-LAT as
pulsating gamma-ray signals, which includes 6 Fermi PWNe and 7 Fermi PWN
associations. We report the analysis of 58 total regions of interest and
provide all firm and tentative detections along with their morphological and
spectral characteristics. There are 11 unidentified gamma-ray sources that we
classify as firm PWN counterparts, which doubles the PWN population detected by
the Fermi-LAT, and 22 gamma-ray sources that are PWN candidates.

employs the localization of echogenic microbubbles (MBs) to finely sample and
image the microcirculation beyond the diffraction limit of ultrasound imaging.
Conventional MB localization methods are mainly based on considering a specific
Point Spread Function (PSF) for MBs, which leads to loss of information caused
by overlapping MBs, non-stationary PSFs, and harmonic MB echoes. Therefore, it
is imperative to devise methods that can accurately localize MBs while being
resilient to MB nonlinearities and variations of MB concentrations that distort
MB PSFs. This paper proposes a transformer-based MB localization approach to
address this issue. We adopted DEtection TRansformer (DETR) arXiv:2005.12872 ,
which is an end-to-end object recognition method that detects a unique bounding
box for each of the detected objects using set-based Hungarian loss and
bipartite matching. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time
transformers have been used for MB localization. To appraise the proposed
strategy, the pre-trained DETR network's performance has been tested for
detecting MBs using transfer learning principles. We have fine-tuned the
network on a subset of randomly selected frames of the dataset provided by the
IEEE IUS Ultra-SR challenge organizers and then tested on the rest using
cross-validation. For the simulation dataset, the paper supports the deployment
of transformer-based solutions for MB localization at high accuracy.

critical in deploying VC systems in many application scenarios. Existing
studies, however, either only provide utterance-level global control or lack
interpretability on the controls. In this paper, we propose ControlVC, the
first neural voice conversion system that achieves time-varying controls on
pitch and speed. ControlVC uses pre-trained encoders to compute pitch and
linguistic embeddings from the source utterance and speaker embeddings from the
target utterance. These embeddings are then concatenated and converted to
speech using a vocoder. It achieves speed control through TD-PSOLA
pre-processing on the source utterance, and achieves pitch control by
manipulating the pitch contour before feeding it to the pitch encoder.
Systematic subjective and objective evaluations are conducted to assess the
speech quality and controllability. Results show that, on non-parallel and
zero-shot conversion tasks, ControlVC significantly outperforms two other
self-constructed baselines on speech quality, and it can successfully achieve
time-varying pitch and speed control.

the property of differential flatness has enabled efficient, effective planning

problem is easily solved, since a given trajectory for the group variables will
fully determine the trajectory for the shape variables that exactly achieves
this motion. We provide a partial catalog of robotic systems with geometric

to expect more companies, including untrustworthy or untrustworthy or

to use less expensive but less reliable or trustworthy hardware. Less trusted

providing the user with a sub-optimal solution or incurring a cost of higher

mission, will result in measurement of the momentum transfer efficiency
accurate to ~10% and characterization of the Didymos binary system. But DART is
a single experiment; how could these results be used in a future planetary
defense necessity involving a different asteroid? We examine what aspects of
Dimorphos's response to kinetic impact will be constrained by DART results; how
these constraints will help refine knowledge of the physical properties of
asteroidal materials and predictive power of impact simulations; what
information about a potential Earth impactor could be acquired before a
deflection effort; and how design of a deflection mission should be informed by
this understanding. We generalize the momentum enhancement factor $\beta$,
showing that a particular direction-specific $\beta$ will be directly
determined by the DART results, and that a related direction-specific $\beta$
is a figure of merit for a kinetic impact mission. The DART $\beta$
determination constrains the ejecta momentum vector, which, with hydrodynamic
simulations, constrains the physical properties of Dimorphos's near-surface. In
a hypothetical planetary defense exigency, extrapolating these constraints to a
newly discovered asteroid will require Earth-based observations and benefit
from in-situ reconnaissance. We show representative predictions for momentum
transfer based on different levels of reconnaissance and discuss strategic
targeting to optimize the deflection and reduce the risk of a counterproductive
deflection in the wrong direction.

Variational Bounds are Not Necessarily Better"" (T Rainforth et al., 2018). We
provide theoretical and empirical evidence that increasing the number of
importance samples $K$ in the importance weighted autoencoder (IWAE) (Burda et
al., 2016) degrades the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the gradient estimator
in the inference network and thereby affecting the full learning process. In
other words, even though increasing $K$ decreases the standard deviation of the
gradients, it also reduces the magnitude of the true gradient faster, thereby
increasing the relative variance of the gradient updates. Extensive experiments
are performed to understand the importance of $K$. These experiments suggest
that tighter variational bounds are beneficial for the generative network,
whereas looser bounds are preferable for the inference network. With these
insights, three methods are implemented and studied: the partially importance
weighted autoencoder (PIWAE), the multiply importance weighted autoencoder
(MIWAE) and the combination importance weighted autoencoder (CIWAE). Each of
these three methods entails IWAE as a special case but employs the importance
weights in different ways to ensure a higher SNR of the gradient estimators. In
our research study and analysis, the efficacy of these algorithms is tested on
multiple datasets such as MNIST and Omniglot. Finally, we demonstrate that the
three presented IWAE variations are able to generate approximate posterior
distributions that are much closer to the true posterior distribution than for
the IWAE, while matching the performance of the IWAE generative network or
potentially outperforming it in the case of PIWAE.

which a spacecraft intentionally impacts an asteroid to change its trajectory.
DART represents an important first step for planetary defense technology
demonstration, providing a realistic assessment of the effectiveness of the
kinetic impact approach on a near-Earth asteroid. The momentum imparted to the
asteroid is transferred from the impacting spacecraft and enhanced by the
momentum of material ejected from the impact site. However, the magnitude of
the ejecta contribution is dependent on the material properties of the target.
These properties, such as strength and shear modulus, are unknown for the DART
target asteroid, Dimorphos, as well as most asteroids since such properties are
difficult to characterize remotely.
  This study examines how hydrocode simulations can be used to estimate
material properties from information available post-impact, specifically the
asteroid size and shape, the velocity and properties of the impacting
spacecraft, and the final velocity change imparted to the asteroid. Across >300
three-dimensional simulations varying seven material parameters describing the
asteroid, we found many combinations of properties could reproduce a particular
asteroid velocity. Additional observations, such as asteroid mass or crater
size, are required to further constrain properties like asteroid strength or
outcomes like the momentum enhancement provided by impact ejecta. Our results
demonstrate the vital importance of having as much knowledge as possible prior
to an impact mission, with key material parameters being the asteroid's mass,
porosity, strength, and elastic properties.

problems using kinematic and dynamic models linearized along nominal

are solvable via the use of Quadratic Programming; therefore, we significantly
reduce the computation time of the proposed MPC framework so the resulting
update frequency is higher than 1 kHz. Our proposed MPC framework is more
efficient in reducing task tracking errors than a baseline based on operational

our method in two practical scenarios for robotic logistics: 1) controlling a
robot carrying heavy payloads while accounting for torque limits, and 2)
controlling the end-effector while avoiding singularities.

Such a strategy even though effective to certain extent leads to substantial
negative transfer, meaning the existence of large portion of tasks for which

by only jointly training tasks that are potentially beneficial to each other.
The proposed method exploits the network weights associated with task specific
classification heads that can be cheaply obtained by one-time joint training of
all tasks. Our results using a dataset consisting of 367 epigenetic profiles
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its superiority over
baseline methods.

is essential to minimize drift when recognizing previously visited places.
Visual Bag-of-Words (vBoW) has been an LCD algorithm of choice for many
state-of-the-art SLAM systems. It uses a set of visual features to provide
robust place recognition but fails to perceive the semantics or spatial
relationship between feature points. Previous work has mainly focused on
addressing these issues by combining vBoW with semantic and spatial information
from objects in the scene. However, they are unable to exploit spatial
information of local visual features and lack a structure that unifies semantic
objects and visual features, therefore limiting the symbiosis between the two
components. This paper proposes SymbioLCD2, which creates a unified graph
structure to integrate semantic objects and visual features symbiotically. Our
novel graph-based LCD system utilizes the unified graph structure by applying a
Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel with temporal constraints to robustly predict
loop closure candidates. Evaluation of the proposed system shows that having a
unified graph structure incorporating semantic objects and visual features
improves LCD prediction accuracy, illustrating that the proposed graph
structure provides a strong symbiosis between these two complementary
components. It also outperforms other Machine Learning algorithms - such as
SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network and GNN based Graph Matching
Networks. Furthermore, it has shown good performance in detecting loop closure
candidates earlier than state-of-the-art SLAM systems, demonstrating that
extended semantic and spatial awareness from the unified graph structure
significantly impacts LCD performance.

success and potential in many privacy-sensitive applications such as personal

unexplored. In this paper, we take an initial attempt towards this and develop
$\textit{CryptoGCN}$--a homomorphic encryption (HE) based GCN inference
framework. A key to the success of our approach is to reduce the tremendous
computational overhead for HE operations, which can be orders of magnitude
higher than its counterparts in the plaintext space. To this end, we develop an
approach that can effectively take advantage of the sparsity of matrix
operations in GCN inference to significantly reduce the computational overhead.
Specifically, we propose a novel AMA data formatting method and associated
spatial convolution methods, which can exploit the complex graph structure and
perform efficient matrix-matrix multiplication in HE computation and thus
greatly reduce the HE operations. We also develop a co-optimization framework
that can explore the trade offs among the accuracy, security level, and
computational overhead by judicious pruning and polynomial approximation of
activation module in GCNs. Based on the NTU-XVIEW skeleton joint dataset, i.e.,
the largest dataset evaluated homomorphically by far as we are aware of, our
experimental results demonstrate that $\textit{CryptoGCN}$ outperforms

have been conducted to enhance speech via operations either in time-domain on
the inner-domain learned from the speech mixture or in time--frequency domain
on the fixed full-band short time Fourier transform (STFT) spectrograms. Very
recently, a few studies on sub-band based speech enhancement have been
proposed. By enhancing speech via operations on sub-band spectrograms, those
studies demonstrated competitive performances on the benchmark dataset of
DNS2020. Despite attractive, this new research direction has not been fully
explored and there is still room for improvement. As such, in this study, we
delve into the latest research direction and propose a sub-band based speech
enhancement system with perceptually-motivated optimization and dual
transformations, called PT-FSE. Specially, our proposed PT-FSE model improves
its backbone, a full-band and sub-band fusion model, by three efforts. First,
we design a frequency transformation module that aims to strengthen the global
frequency correlation. Then a temporal transformation is introduced to capture
long range temporal contexts. Lastly, a novel loss, with leverage of properties
of human auditory perception, is proposed to facilitate the model to focus on
low frequency enhancement. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed model,
extensive experiments are conducted on the DNS2020 dataset. Experimental
results show that our PT-FSE system achieves substantial improvements over its

scenario of multi-party conversion. Despite numerous research efforts and
progresses, comparing with speech activity detection (VAD), OSD remains an open
challenge and its overall performance is far from satisfactory. The majority of
prior research typically formulates the OSD problem as a standard
classification problem, to identify speech with binary (OSD) or three-class
label (joint VAD and OSD) at frame level. In contrast to the mainstream, this
study investigates the joint VAD and OSD task from a new perspective. In
particular, we propose to extend traditional classification network with
multi-exit architecture. Such an architecture empowers our system with unique
capability to identify class using either low-level features from early exits
or high-level features from last exit. In addition, two training schemes,
knowledge distillation and dense connection, are adopted to further boost our
system performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (AMI and
DIHARD-III) validated the effectiveness and generality of our proposed system.
Our ablations further reveal the complementary contribution of proposed
schemes. With $F_1$ score of 0.792 on AMI and 0.625 on DIHARD-III, our proposed
system outperforms several top performing models on these datasets, but also
surpasses the current state-of-the-art by large margins across both datasets.
Besides the performance benefit, our proposed system offers another appealing
potential for quality-complexity trade-offs, which is highly preferred for
efficient OSD deployment.

Lagrangian method. Two-dimensional configuration is considered, and the effects
of droplet diameter and liquid equivalence ratio on detonation propagation,
structure, and dynamics are investigated. The results show that the average
detonation propagation speed first increases and then decreases as liquid
equivalence ratio changes, and the speed peaks at higher liquid equivalence
ratio for larger droplets. The triple points and transverse detonations
vaporize or aerodynamically expel the droplets from their trajectories,
resulting in non-uniform distributions of fuel vapor and reaction zones behind
the detonation. In addition, droplet dispersion distance in the post-detonation
area increases for larger droplets due to lower evaporation. Moreover, small
droplets generally lead to higher detonated n-heptane fraction, and fuel
detonative combustion directly affects the variations of detonated fuel
fraction. For larger droplets, V shaped dependence on liquid equivalence ratio
is seen for large droplets, dominated by variations of post-detonation
deflagration. It is found that spray detonation structure is significantly
influenced by liquid fuel equivalence ratio and droplet diameter. The
dependence of key locations in spray detonation structure on liquid fuel
properties is also evaluated, e.g., reaction front and sonic plane.

pronounced unsteadiness, such as instantaneous or complete extinction. Either

have revealed the existence of red giants with [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios that are
anomalously high, given their relatively young ages. We revisit the GALAH DR3
survey to look for both dwarfs and giants with extreme [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios,
that is, the upper 1% in the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane over the range in
[Fe/H] between -1.1 and +0.4 dex. We refer to these outliers as ""ex$\alpha$fe""
stars. We used the GALAH DR3 data and their value-added catalog to trace the
properties (abundances, masses, ages, and kinematics) of the ex$\alpha$fe
stars. We investigated the effects of secular evolution and the magnitude
limitations of GALAH to understand the mass and metallicity distributions of
the sample stars. We also discuss the corresponding biases in previous studies
of stars with high [$\alpha$/Fe] in other surveys. We find both dwarf and giant
ex$\alpha$fe stars younger than 3 Gyr, which we refer to as ""y-ex$\alpha$fe""
stars. Dwarf y-ex$\alpha$fe stars exhibit lithium abundances similar to those
of young [$\alpha$/Fe]-normal dwarfs at the same age and [Fe/H]. In particular,
the youngest and most massive stars of both populations exhibit the highest Li
abundances, A(Li)~3.5 dex (i.e., a factor of 2 above the protosolar value),
while cooler/older stars exhibit the same Li depletion patterns increasing with
both decreasing mass and increasing age. In addition, the [Fe/H] and mass
distributions of both the dwarf and giant y-ex$\alpha$fe stars do not differ
from those of their [$\alpha$/Fe]-normal counterparts found in the thin disk
and they share the same kinematic properties. We conclude that y-ex$\alpha$fe
dwarfs and giants are indeed young, their mass distribution shows no
peculiarity, and they differ from young [$\alpha$/Fe]-normal stars by their
extreme [$\alpha$/Fe] content only. However, their origin remains unclear.

uncertainty in either gradient evaluation or iteration updates. For strongly
convex quadratic problems, we use the steady-state variance of the error in the
optimization variable to quantify noise amplification and identify fundamental
stochastic performance tradeoffs. Our approach utilizes the Jury stability
criterion to provide a novel geometric characterization of conditions for
linear convergence, and it clarifies the relation between the noise
amplification and convergence rate as well as their dependence on the condition
number and the constant algorithmic parameters. This geometric insight leads to
simple alternative proofs of standard convergence results and allows us to
establish analytical lower bounds on the product between the settling time and
noise amplification that scale quadratically with the condition number. Our
analysis also identifies a key difference between the gradient and iterate
noise models: while the amplification of gradient noise can be made arbitrarily
small by sufficiently decelerating the algorithm, the best achievable variance
amplification for the iterate noise model increases linearly with the settling
time in decelerating regime. Furthermore, we introduce two parameterized
families of algorithms that strike a balance between noise amplification and
settling time while preserving order-wise Pareto optimality for both noise

whose suitable discretization yields the two-step momentum algorithm, we
establish that stochastic performance tradeoffs also extend to continuous time.

and structural assumptions (e.g., conditional independence) to identify the

Can interventional data facilitate causal representation learning? We explore
this question in this paper. The key observation is that interventional data
often carries geometric signatures of the latent factors' support (i.e. what
values each latent can possibly take). For example, when the latent factors are
causally connected, interventions can break the dependency between the
intervened latents' support and their ancestors'. Leveraging this fact, we
prove that the latent causal factors can be identified up to permutation and
scaling given data from perfect $do$ interventions. Moreover, we can achieve
block affine identification, namely the estimated latent factors are only
entangled with a few other latents if we have access to data from imperfect
interventions. These results highlight the unique power of interventional data
in causal representation learning; they can enable provable identification of
latent factors without any assumptions about their distributions or dependency
structure.

Recently, it has gained a growing interest to manipulate such topological

radial positions of red blood cells (RBCs) with major diameter of 8 $\mu$m
under a Newtonian fluid in a circular channel with 50-$\mu$m diameter. Each
RBC, modelled as a biconcave capsule whose membrane satisfies strain-hardening
characteristics, is simulated for different Reynolds numbers $Re$ and capillary
numbers $Ca$, the latter of which indicate the ratio of the fluid viscous force
to the membrane elastic force. The effects of initial orientation angles and
positions on the equilibrium radial position of an RBC centroid are also
investigated. The numerical results show that depending on their initial
orientations, RBCs have bistable flow modes, so-called rolling and tumbling
motions. Most RBCs have a rolling motion. These stable modes are accompanied by
different equilibrium radial positions, where tumbling RBCs are further away
from the channel axis than rolling ones. The inertial migration of RBCs is
achieved by alternating orientation angles, which are primarily affected by the
initial orientation angles. Then the RBCs assume the aforementioned bistable
modes during the migration, followed by further migration to the equilibrium
radial position at much longer time periods. The power (or energy dissipation)
associated with membrane deformations is introduced to quantify the state of

online arriving items of different sizes and values into a capacity-limited
knapsack. In this paper, we study a general version that includes item
departures, while also considering multiple knapsacks and multi-dimensional
item sizes. We design a threshold-based online algorithm and prove that the
algorithm can achieve order-optimal competitive ratios. Beyond worst-case
performance guarantees, we also aim to achieve near-optimal average performance
under typical instances. Towards this goal, we propose a data-driven online
algorithm that learns within a policy-class that guarantees a worst-case
performance bound. In trace-driven experiments, we show that our data-driven
algorithm outperforms other benchmark algorithms in an application of online
knapsack to job scheduling for cloud computing.

is crucial for robotics applications. The existing solution, pose graph
optimization, though it is time-efficient, does not directly optimize the
mapping consistency. LiDAR bundle adjustment (BA) has been recently proposed to
resolve this issue; however, it is too time-consuming on large-scale maps. To
mitigate this problem, this paper presents a globally consistent and efficient
mapping method suitable for large-scale maps. Our proposed work consists of a
bottom-up hierarchical BA and a top-down pose graph optimization, which
combines the advantages of both methods. With the hierarchical design, we solve
multiple BA problems with a much smaller Hessian matrix size than the original
BA; with the pose graph optimization, we smoothly and efficiently update the
LiDAR poses. The effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach have
been validated on multiple spatially and timely large-scale public spinning
LiDAR datasets, i.e., KITTI, MulRan and Newer College, and self-collected
solid-state LiDAR datasets under structured and unstructured scenes. With
proper setups, we demonstrate our work could generate a globally consistent map

effect of pileup and initial volume fluctuations on these observables and the

calculations from the hadronic transport UrQMD model as well as a hydrodynamic

$C_4/C_2$ is negative, drastically different from the values observed in Au+Au

continuous gravitational wave (GW) observations. The r-mode frequencies for
slowly rotating Newtonian stars are well-known and independent of the equation
of state (EOS) but for neutron stars, several mechanisms can alter the r-mode
frequency of which the relativistic correction is dominant and relevant for
most of the neutron stars. The most sensitive searches for continuous GWs are
those for known pulsars for which GW frequencies are in targeted narrow
frequency bands of few Hz. In this study, we investigate the effect of several
state-of-the-art multi-messenger constraints on the r-mode frequency for
relativistic, slowly rotating, barotropic stars. Imposing these recent
constraints on the EOS, we find that the r-mode frequency range is slightly
higher from the previous study and the narrow band frequency range can increase
upto 8-25% for the most promising candidate PSR J0537-6910 depending on the
range of compactness. We also derive universal relations between r-mode
frequency and dimensionless tidal deformability which can be used to estimate
the dynamical tide of the r-mode resonant excitation during the inspiral
signal. These results can be used to construct the parameter space for r-mode
searches in gravitational wave data and also constrain the nuclear equation of
state following a successful r-mode detection.

heavy ball (CHB) method for distributed learning in a server-worker
architecture. Each worker self-censors unless its local gradient is
sufficiently different from the previously transmitted one. The significant
practical advantages of the HB method for learning problems are well known, but
the question of reducing communications has not been addressed. CHB takes
advantage of the HB smoothing to eliminate reporting small changes, and
provably achieves a linear convergence rate equivalent to that of the classical
HB method for smooth and strongly convex objective functions. The convergence
guarantee of CHB is theoretically justified for both convex and nonconvex
cases. In addition we prove that, under some conditions, at least half of all
communications can be eliminated without any impact on convergence rate.
Extensive numerical results validate the communication efficiency of CHB on
both synthetic and real datasets, for convex, nonconvex, and nondifferentiable
cases. Given a target accuracy, CHB can significantly reduce the number of
communications compared to existing algorithms, achieving the same accuracy
without slowing down the optimization process.

resources, MP systems often rely on vast amount of open-source code to learn
interesting properties about code and programming and solve problems in the
areas of debugging, code recommendation, auto-completion, etc. Unfortunately,
several of the existing MP systems either do not consider quality of code
repositories or use atypical quality measures than those typically used in
software engineering community to select them. As such, impact of quality of
code repositories on the performance of these systems needs to be studied.
  In this preliminary paper, we evaluate impact of different quality
repositories on the performance of a candidate MP system. Towards that
objective, we develop a framework, named GitRank, to rank open-source
repositories on quality, maintainability, and popularity by leveraging existing
research on this topic. We then apply GitRank to evaluate correlation between
the quality measures used by the candidate MP system and the quality measures
used by our framework. Our preliminary results reveal some correlation between
the quality measures used in GitRank and ControlFlag's performance, suggesting
that some of the measures used in GitRank are applicable to ControlFlag. But it
also raises questions around right quality measures for code repositories used

operation and arbitrary control of beam polarizations. Although most of the
previous designs of PCSELs employ spatially uniform photonic crystals, it is
expected that lasing performance can be further improved if it becomes possible
to optimize the spatial distribution of photonic crystals. In this paper, we
investigate the structural optimization of PCSELs via quantum annealing towards
high-power, narrow-beam-divergence operation with linear polarization. The
optimization of PCSELs is performed by the iteration of the following three
steps: (1) time-dependent 3D coupled-wave analysis of lasing performance, (2)
formulation of the lasing performance via a factorization machine, and (3)
selection of optimal solution(s) via quantum annealing. By using this approach,
we successfully discover an advanced PCSEL with a non-uniform spatial
distribution of the band-edge frequency and injection current, which
simultaneously enables higher output power, a narrower divergence angle, and a
higher linear polarization ratio than conventional uniform PCSELs. Our results
potentially indicate the universal applicability of quantum annealing, which
has been mainly applied to specific types of discrete optimization problems so
far, for various physics and engineering problems in the field of smart

require quantum key distribution-secured semantic information communication
(QKD-SIC). In QKD-SIC systems, edge devices connected via quantum channels can
efficiently encrypt semantic information from the semantic source, and securely
transmit the encrypted semantic information to the semantic destination. In
this paper, we consider an efficient resource (i.e., QKD and KM wavelengths)
sharing problem to support QKD-SIC systems under the uncertainty of semantic
information generated by edge devices. In such a system, QKD service providers
offer QKD services with different subscription options to the edge devices. As
such, to reduce the cost for the edge device users, we propose a QKD resource
management framework for the edge devices communicating semantic information.
The framework is based on a two-stage stochastic optimization model to achieve
optimal QKD deployment. Moreover, to reduce the deployment cost of QKD service
providers, QKD resources in the proposed framework can be utilized based on
efficient QKD-SIC resource management, including semantic information
transmission among edge devices, secret-key provisioning, and cooperation
formation among QKD service providers. In detail, the formulated two-stage
stochastic optimization model can achieve the optimal QKD-SIC resource
deployment while meeting the secret-key requirements for semantic information
transmission of edge devices. Moreover, to share the cost of the QKD resource
pool among cooperative QKD service providers forming a coalition in a fair and
interpretable manner, the proposed framework leverages the concept of Shapley
value from cooperative game theory as a solution. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework can reduce the deployment cost by about
40% compared with existing non-cooperative baselines.

S-stabilizability of a group of multi-agent systems with general linear

the S-stabilizability can be described in some way that the stabilizability
region and feedback gain can evaluate the performance of the protocol. Firstly,
a new distributed event-triggered protocol is proposed. Under this protocol, a
kind of hybrid static and dynamic event-triggered strategy are presented,
respectively. In particular, by using Lyapunov stability theory and graph
partition tool, it is proved that the proposed event-triggered control strategy
can guarantee the closed-loop system achieve S-stabilizability effectively, if
at least one vertex in each iSCC cell receives information from the leader,
which reflects the ability of distributed control law. Further, we demonstrate
that the stabilizability can be realized if the initial system matrix A is
Hurwitz. Moreover, it is confirmed that the designed static event-triggered
condition is a limit case of dynamic event condition and can guarantee
Zeno-free behavior. Finally, the validity of the theoretical results is proved

Shifted samples as points which are visually different but semantically akin to

robustness of deep neural networks. The popular adversarial attack algorithms
maximize the non-concave loss function using the gradient ascent. However, the
performance of each attack is usually sensitive to, for instance, minor image
transformations due to insufficient information (only one input example, few
white-box source models and unknown defense strategies). Hence, the crafted
adversarial examples are prone to overfit the source model, which limits their
transferability to unidentified architectures. In this paper, we propose
Multiple Asymptotically Normal Distribution Attacks (MultiANDA), a novel method
that explicitly characterizes adversarial perturbations from a learned
distribution. Specifically, we approximate the posterior distribution over the
perturbations by taking advantage of the asymptotic normality property of
stochastic gradient ascent (SGA), then apply the ensemble strategy on this
procedure to estimate a Gaussian mixture model for a better exploration of the
potential optimization space. Drawing perturbations from the learned
distribution allow us to generate any number of adversarial examples for each
input. The approximated posterior essentially describes the stationary
distribution of SGA iterations, which captures the geometric information around
the local optimum. Thus, the samples drawn from the distribution reliably
maintain the transferability. Our proposed method outperforms nine
state-of-the-art black-box attacks on deep learning models with or without
defenses through extensive experiments on seven normally trained and seven
defence models.

which is a regression on ordered categorical data as the response variable.
``Outlier"" means that the combination of ordered categorical data and its
covariates is heterogeneous compared to other pairs. Although the ordinal
response model is important for data analysis in various fields such as
medicine and social sciences, it is known that the maximum likelihood method
with probit, logit, log-log and complementary log-log link functions, which are
often used, is strongly affected by outliers, and statistical analysts are
forced to limit their analysis when there may be outliers in the data. To solve
this problem, this paper provides inference methods with two robust divergences
(the density-power and $\gamma$-divergences). We also derive influence
functions for the proposed methods and show conditions on the link function for
them to be bounded and to redescendence. Since the commonly used link functions
satisfy these conditions, the analyst can perform robust and flexible analysis
with our methods. In addition, and this is a result that further highlights our
contributions, we show that the influence function in the maximum likelihood
method does not have redescendence for any link function in the ordinal
response model. Through numerical experiments using artificial and two real
data, we show that the proposed methods perform better than the maximum
likelihood method with and without outliers in the data for various link

direction-sensitive detectors with a high resolution for optimal tracking of

Therefore, they are easily
influenced by external factors. EEG artifact removal is crucial in neuroscience
because artifacts have a significant impact on the results of EEG analysis. The
removal of ocular artifacts is the most challenging among these artifacts. In
this study, a novel ocular artifact removal method is presented by developing
bidirectional long-short term memory (BiLSTM)-based deep learning (DL) models.
We created a benchmarking dataset to train and test proposed DL models by
combining the EEGdenoiseNet and DEAP datasets. We also augmented the data by
contaminating ground-truth clean EEG signals with EOG at various SNR levels.
The BiLSTM network is then fed to features extracted from augmented signals
using highly-localized time-frequency (TF) coefficients obtained by wavelet
synchrosqueezed transform (WSST). We also compare the WSST-based DL model
results with traditional TF analysis (TFA) methods namely short-time Fourier
transformation (STFT) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) as well as
augmented raw signals. The best average MSE value of 0.3066 was obtained by the
first time-proposed BiLSTM-based WSST-Net model. Our results demonstrated the
WSST-Net model significantly improves artifact removal performance compared to
traditional TF and raw signal methods. Also, the proposed EOG removal approach
reveals that it outperforms many conventional and DL-based ocular artifact
removal methods in the literature.

consistently, exist for stationary ergodic sources over finite alphabets but
not over countably infinite ones. We generalize universal coding as the problem
of universal densities with respect to a fixed reference measure on a countably
generated measurable space. We show that universal densities, which estimate
the differential entropy rate consistently, exist for finite reference
measures. Thus finite alphabets are not necessary in some sense. To exhibit a
universal density, we adapt the non-parametric differential (NPD) entropy rate
estimator by Feutrill and Roughan. Our modification is analogous to Ryabko's
modification of prediction by partial matching (PPM) by Cleary and Witten.
Whereas Ryabko considered a mixture over Markov orders, we consider a mixture
over quantization levels. Moreover, we demonstrate that any universal density
induces a strongly consistent Ces\`aro mean estimator of conditional density
given an infinite past. This yields a universal predictor with the $0-1$ loss
for a countable alphabet. Finally, we specialize universal densities to
processes over natural numbers and on the real line. We derive sufficient
conditions for consistent estimation of the entropy rate with respect to
infinite reference measures in these domains.

generic mechanism to account for the early-time anomalous relaxations in such

fascinating interplay between persistence and interaction is quantified in
terms of two length scales - ``mean free path"" and persistence length
$l_p=v/\gamma$, with $v$ being the self-propulsion speed. Indeed we show that
the bulk-diffusion coefficient has a scaling form $D(\rho, \gamma) = D^{(0)}
{\cal F}(\rho v/\gamma)$, where $D^{(0)}$ is proportional to the diffusivity of
noninteracting particles; the scaling function ${\cal F}(\psi)$ is calculated
analytically for one model and numerically for the other. In this limit, we
find that the bulk-diffusion coefficient varies as a power law in a wide range
of density: $D \propto \rho^{-\alpha}$, with exponent $\alpha$ gradually
crossing over from $\alpha=2$ at high densities to $\alpha=0$ at low densities.
As a result, the density relaxation is governed by a nonlinear diffusion
equation with anomalous spatiotemporal scaling that can even be ballistic in
certain regimes. Our arguments, as demonstrated in simulations, are rather
generic, being independent of dimensions and microscopic details.

event-by-event collisions where nucleon positions fluctuate from the smooth

Triangular flows of the bulk medium and heavy flavor particles can be developed
due to the initial fluctuations. In the longitudinal direction, the
rapidity-odd distribution of the initial energy density is induced by the
rotation of the medium in non-central heavy-ion collisions. Charmonium suffers
biased dissociation along positive and negative $x$-directions in forward
(backward) rapidity. The directed flow of charmonium becomes non-zero. The
directed, elliptic and triangular flows ($v_1, v_2, v_3$) of charmonium come
from the anisotropic initial distributions of the medium energy density in the

other financial assets, due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of its transacting
entities. An ideal detection model is expected to achieve all the three
properties of (I) early detection, (II) good interpretability, and (III)
versatility for various illicit activities. However, existing solutions cannot
meet all these requirements, as most of them heavily rely on deep learning
without satisfying interpretability and are only available for retrospective
analysis of a specific illicit type.
  First, we present asset transfer paths, which aim to describe addresses'
early characteristics. Next, with a decision tree based strategy for feature
selection and segmentation, we split the entire observation period into
different segments and encode each as a segment vector. After clustering all
these segment vectors, we get the global status vectors, essentially the basic
unit to describe the whole intention. Finally, a hierarchical self-attention
predictor predicts the label for the given address in real time. A survival
module tells the predictor when to stop and proposes the status sequence,
namely intention. %
  With the type-dependent selection strategy and global status vectors, our
model can be applied to detect various illicit activities with strong
interpretability. The well-designed predictor and particular loss functions
strengthen the model's prediction speed and interpretability one step further.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our proposed

studies justify our model can not only explain existing illicit patterns but
can also find new suspicious characters.

difficult since such agents are often trained in complex environments using
highly complex decision making procedures. This has given rise to a variety of
approaches to explainability in RL that aim to reconcile discrepancies that may
arise between the behavior of an agent and the behavior that is anticipated by
an observer. Most recent approaches have relied either on domain knowledge that
may not always be available, on an analysis of the agent's policy, or on an
analysis of specific elements of the underlying environment, typically modeled
as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our key claim is that even if the
underlying model is not fully known (e.g., the transition probabilities have
not been accurately learned) or is not maintained by the agent (i.e., when
using model-free methods), the model can nevertheless be exploited to
automatically generate explanations. For this purpose, we suggest using formal
MDP abstractions and transforms, previously used in the literature for
expediting the search for optimal policies, to automatically produce
explanations. Since such transforms are typically based on a symbolic
representation of the environment, they can provide meaningful explanations for
gaps between the anticipated and actual agent behavior. We formally define the
explainability problem, suggest a class of transforms that can be used for
explaining emergent behaviors, and suggest methods that enable efficient search
for an explanation. We demonstrate the approach on a set of standard
benchmarks.

fracture propagation regimes, as correspond to the different coupling of
predominant mechanisms depending on material parameters and fracture

regimes dictate the propagation of finite fractures of simple geometries (e.g.
2D plane-strain, or 3D radial cracks) driven by fluid injection at the center
of the crack. These notes are not a review of the research on the topic, which
has seen tremendous renewed interest in the last 20 years or so, (for a review

pose and reconstructing their shapes from depth point cloud sequences in the
wild, given the initial poses at frame 0. We for the first time propose a point
cloud based hand joint tracking network, HandTrackNet, to estimate the
inter-frame hand joint motion. Our HandTrackNet proposes a novel hand pose
canonicalization module to ease the tracking task, yielding accurate and robust
hand joint tracking. Our pipeline then reconstructs the full hand via
converting the predicted hand joints into a template-based parametric hand
model MANO. For object tracking, we devise a simple yet effective module that
estimates the object SDF from the first frame and performs optimization-based
tracking. Finally, a joint optimization step is adopted to perform joint hand
and object reasoning, which alleviates the occlusion-induced ambiguity and
further refines the hand pose. During training, the whole pipeline only sees
purely synthetic data, which are synthesized with sufficient variations and by
depth simulation for the ease of generalization. The whole pipeline is
pertinent to the generalization gaps and thus directly transferable to real
in-the-wild data. We evaluate our method on two real hand object interaction
datasets, e.g. HO3D and DexYCB, without any finetuning. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art depth-based hand and object pose estimation and tracking
methods, running at a frame rate of 9 FPS.

tracking benchmarks including OTB2013, OTB2015, VOT2015, VOT2016, and UAV123

original SiamFC++. Compared with the existing SNN-based target tracker, e.g.,
the SiamSNN, the precision (succession) of the proposed Spiking SiamFC++
reaches 85.24% (64.37%), which is much higher than that of 52.78% (44.32%)

decision-making under uncertainty that incorporates resource consumption
constraints. In each round, the decision-maker observes an outcome consisting
of a reward and a vector of nonnegative resource consumptions, and the budget
of each resource is decremented by its consumption. In this paper we introduce
a natural generalization of the stochastic BwK problem that allows
non-monotonic resource utilization. In each round, the decision-maker observes
an outcome consisting of a reward and a vector of resource drifts that can be
positive, negative or zero, and the budget of each resource is incremented by
its drift. Our main result is a Markov decision process (MDP) policy that has
constant regret against a linear programming (LP) relaxation when the
decision-maker knows the true outcome distributions. We build upon this to
develop a learning algorithm that has logarithmic regret against the same LP
relaxation when the decision-maker does not know the true outcome
distributions. We also present a reduction from BwK to our model that shows our
regret bound matches existing results.

Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can succeed but require large amounts of

unsupervised RL proposes to employ self-supervised interaction and learning,
for adapting faster to future tasks. Yet, as shown in the Unsupervised RL
Benchmark (URLB; Laskin et al. 2021), whether current unsupervised strategies
can improve generalization capabilities is still unclear, especially in visual

task-aware fine-tuning strategy combined with a new proposed hybrid planner,
Dyna-MPC, to adapt the agent for downstream tasks. On URLB, our method obtains
93.59% overall normalized performance, surpassing previous baselines by a

binary structures, initiated in the previous paper of the series. We first
introduce the notion of parity and linear minors of a matrix, which consists of
iteratively replacing consecutive rows or consecutive columns with a linear
combination of them. We show that a matrix class has bounded twin-width if and
only if its linear-minor closure does not contain all matrices. We observe that
the fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for first-order model checking on
structures given with an $O(1)$-sequence (certificate of bounded twin-width)
and the fact that first-order transductions of bounded twin-width classes have
bounded twin-width, both established in Twin-width I, extend to first-order
logic with modular counting quantifiers. We make explicit a win-win argument
obtained as a by-product of Twin-width IV, and somewhat similar to
bidimensionality, that we call rank-bidimensionality. Armed with the
above-mentioned extension to modular counting, we show that the twin-width of
the product of two conformal matrices $A, B$ over a finite field is bounded by
a function of the twin-width of $A$, of $B$, and of the size of the field.
Furthermore, if $A$ and $B$ are $n \times n$ matrices of twin-width $d$ over
$\mathbb F_q$, we show that $AB$ can be computed in time $O_{d,q}(n^2 \log n)$.
We finally present an ad hoc algorithm to efficiently multiply two matrices of
bounded twin-width, with a single-exponential dependence in the twin-width
bound: If the inputs are given in a compact tree-like form, called
twin-decomposition (of width $d$), then two $n \times n$ matrices $A, B$ over
$\mathbb F_2$, a twin-decomposition of $AB$ with width $2^{d+o(d)}$ can be
computed in time $4^{d+o(d)}n$ (resp. $4^{d+o(d)}n^{1+\varepsilon}$), and
entries queried in doubly-logarithmic (resp. constant) time.

for qubit performance that consider the design and layout of the qubit devices.
This approach, has recently been adopted for superconducting qubits, but has
received little attention for spin qubits in semiconductors. Here, we employ
models for both the device and the quantum mechanical states in the valence
band to theoretically investigate the properties of hole spin qubits in
laterally gated quantum dots in group-IV materials, which have received
significant recent attention. We find that device design impacts qubit
properties in unexpected ways. First, the presence of optimal operation points
where coherence times are long and qubits can be rapidly manipulated results
not only from gate-voltage-induced changes to the Rashba coefficient, but also
from gate-voltage-induced changes to quantum dot radius in real devices, which
impacts g-factor even when inversion symmetry is preserved (Rashba coupling is
zero). Second, the qubit electric manipulation is substantially higher in the
realistic anharmonic potential, by an order of magnitude in the device design
we consider, compared with a harmonic potential assumption, because the
transverse electric dipole of the qubit depends on electrically mediated
couplings to many excited states. Finally, we show that the rapid electric
drive, compatible with long coherence times, can be achieved in the single-hole
regime, with and without strain. These results establish the need for realistic
description of both the device and the quantum mechanical states to support the
design of spin qubit devices, identify new ways to control hole qubit
properties.

segmentation requires long execution time and is prone to variability,
impairing the realisation of radiomic studies and their robustness. In this
study, a deep-learning automatic segmentation method was applied on computed
tomography images of non-small-cell lung cancer patients. The use of manual vs
automatic segmentation in the performance of survival radiomic models was
assessed, as well. METHODS A total of 899 NSCLC patients were included (2
proprietary: A and B, 1 public datasets: C). Automatic segmentation of lung
lesions was performed by training a previously developed architecture, the
nnU-Net, including 2D, 3D and cascade approaches. The quality of automatic
segmentation was evaluated with DICE coefficient, considering manual contours
as reference. The impact of automatic segmentation on the performance of a
radiomic model for patient survival was explored by extracting radiomic
hand-crafted and deep-learning features from manual and automatic contours of
dataset A, and feeding different machine learning algorithms to classify
survival above/below median. Models' accuracies were assessed and compared.
RESULTS The best agreement between automatic and manual contours with DICE=0.78
+(0.12) was achieved by averaging predictions from 2D and 3D models, and
applying a post-processing technique to extract the maximum connected
component. No statistical differences were observed in the performances of
survival models when using manual or automatic contours, hand-crafted, or deep
features. The best classifier showed an accuracy between 0.65 and 0.78.
CONCLUSION The promising role of nnU-Net for automatic segmentation of lung

ionising radiation and limited access to CT scanners within research groups.
  Objective: We present a validated open-source tool for researchers to obtain
individual skull estimates from T1-weighted MR images, for use in acoustic
simulations.
  Methods: We refined a previously trained and validated 3D convolutional
neural network (CNN) to generate 100 keV pseudo-CTs. The network was pretrained
on 110 individuals and refined and tested on a database of 37 healthy control
individuals. We compared simulations based on reference CTs to simulations
based on our pseudo-CTs and binary skull masks, a common alternative in the
absence of CT.
  Results: Compared with reference CTs, our CNN produced pseudo-CTs with a mean
absolute error of 109.8 +/- 13.0 HU across the whole head and 319.3 +/- 31.9 HU
in the skull. In acoustic simulations, the focal pressure was statistically
equivalent for simulations based on reference CT and pseudo-CT (0.48 +/- 0.04

  Conclusions: We show that our network can produce pseudo-CT comparable to

ferroelectric instability at low temperature due to quantum fluctuations
associated with anharmonic phonon effects. The temperature-dependent evolution
of the soft ferroelectric phonon mode in the quantum paraelectric KTaO$_3$ in
the range 0-300 K is modelled by combining density functional theory (DFT)
calculations with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation
assisted by an on-the-fly machine-learned force field. The calculated data show
that including anharmonic terms is essential to stabilize the spurious
imaginary ferroelectric phonon predicted by DFT, in agreement with experiments.
Augmenting the DFT workflow with machine-learned force fields allows for
efficient stochastic sampling of the configurational space using large
supercells in a broad and dense temperature range, inaccessible by conventional

of accounting for collective behaviors involving different degrees of freedom

derivatives is used as a basis for modeling charge injection by ruthenium dyes
into a semiconductor substrate. By including the effects of light scattering,
dye diffusion and adsorption kinetics during sample preparation, and the
optical response of oxidized dyes, quantitative agreement with multiple
transient absorption datasets is achieved on timescales spanning femtoseconds
to nanoseconds. In particular, quantitative agreement with important
spectroscopic handles, decay of an excited state absorption signal component
associated with charge injection in the UV region of the spectrum and the
dynamical redshift of an approximately 500 nm isosbestic point, validates our
kinetic model. Pseudo-first-order rate coefficients for charge injection are
estimated in this work, with an order of magnitude ranging 1011 s-1 to 1012
s-1. The model makes the minimalist assumption that all excited states of a
particular dye have the same charge injection coefficient, an assumption that
would benefit from additional theoretical and experimental exploration. We have
adapted this kinetic model to predict charge injection under continuous solar
irradiation, and find that as many as 68 electron transfer events per dye per
second take place, significantly more than prior estimates in the literature.

and rate selection to maximize the energy efficiency is investigated in this
paper. Unlike prior literature, time-correlated fading channels is considered
and two widely concerned quality of service (QoS) constraints, i.e., outage and
goodput constraints, are also considered in the optimization, which further
differentiates this work from prior ones. Using a unified expression of
asymptotic outage probabilities, optimal transmission powers and optimal rate
are derived in closed-forms to maximize the energy efficiency while satisfying
the QoS constraints. These closed-form solutions then enable a thorough
analysis of the maximal energy efficiencies of various HARQ schemes. It is
revealed that with low outage constraint, the maximal energy efficiency
achieved by Type I HARQ is $\frac{1}{4\ln2}$ bits/J, while HARQ-CC and HARQ-IR
can achieve the same maximal energy efficiency as $\frac{\kappa_\infty}{4\ln2}$
bits/J where $\kappa_\infty = 1.6617$. Moreover, time correlation in the fading
channels has a negative impact on the energy efficiency, while large maximal
allowable number of transmissions is favorable for the improvement of energy
efficiency. The effectiveness of the energy-efficient optimization is verified
by extensive simulations and the results also show that HARQ-CC can achieve the
best tradeoff between energy efficiency and spectral efficiency among the three

Different from prior analysis, time correlation in the channels is considered.
Under time-correlated fading channels, the mutual information in multiple HARQ
transmissions is correlated, making the analysis challenging. By using
polynomial fitting technique, probability distribution function of the
accumulated mutual information is derived. Three meaningful performance metrics
including outage probability, average number of transmissions and long term
average throughput (LTAT) are then derived in closed-forms. Moreover, diversity
order of HARQ-IR is also investigated. It is proved that full diversity can be
achieved by HARQ-IR, i.e., the diversity order is equal to the number of
transmissions, even under time-correlated fading channels. These analytical
results are verified by simulations and enable the evaluation of the impact of
various system parameters on the performance. Particularly, the results unveil
the negative impact of time correlation on the outage and throughput
performance. The results also show that although more transmissions would
improve the outage performance, they may not be beneficial to the LTAT when

power efficiency is further improved when the time correlation is reduced

show that the dilated convolutional filters are ideally suited to extract
relevant information from intraday financial data, thereby naturally mimicking
(via a data-driven approach) the econometric models which incorporate realised
measures of volatility into the forecast. This allows us to take advantage of
the abundance of intraday observations, helping us to avoid the limitations of
models that use daily data, such as model misspecification or manually designed
handcrafted features, whose devise involves optimising the trade-off between
accuracy and computational efficiency and makes models prone to lack of
adaptation into changing circumstances. In our analysis, we use two years of

Vehicles (AV), which are potentially safer than regular vehicles. However,
ensuring good performance for the autonomous features requires fast processing
of heavy computational tasks. Providing each AV with powerful enough computing
resources is certainly a practical solution but may result in increased AV cost
and decreased driving range. An alternative solution being explored in research
is to install low-power computing hardware on each AV and offload the heavy
tasks to powerful nearby edge servers. In this case, the AV's reaction time
depends on how quickly the navigation tasks are completed in the edge server.
To reduce task completion latency, the edge servers must be equipped with
enough network and computing resources to handle the vehicle demands. However,
this demand shows large spatio-temporal variations. Thus, deploying the same
amount of resources in different locations may lead to unnecessary resource
over-provisioning.
  Taking these challenges into consideration, in this paper, we discuss the
implications of deploying different amounts of resources in different city
areas based on real traffic data to sustain peak versus average demand. Because
deploying edge resources to handle the average demand leads to lower deployment
costs and better system utilization, we then investigate how peak-hour demand
affect the safe travel time of AVs and whether current turn-by-turn navigation
apps would still provide the fastest travel route. The insights and findings of
this paper will inspire new research that can considerably speed up the
deployment of edge-assisted AVs in our society.

and hydrocarbon reservoirs in the central Gulf of Mexico (GOM) for CO2
sequestration and CO2-driven enhanced oil and gas recovery and estimate the
corresponding CO2 storage resources for select reservoirs. To this end, three
major objectives have been completed: managing geological data from different
sources, building a reservoir screening platform for CO2 storage, and ranking
the reservoirs based on the estimated storage potential. First, the major
geological characteristics of both shelf and deep-water areas of the central
GOM were examined and compared to define the appropriate reservoir screening
criteria. Consequently, the CO2 storage resources of the screened reservoirs
were calculated and reported at the BOEM field level to identify fields with
the highest storage potential. In the project's current phase, the assessment
is being expanded to saline formations. Correlations are being identified,
tested, and developed for a broad range of rock and fluid properties, including
thickness, porosity, permeability, fluid saturation, and fluid chemistry. These
correlations are developed for interfacial tension and CO2 saturated brine
viscosity to improve the storage estimates and consider the capillary trapping
and solubility of CO2 in reservoir fluids. SAS Viya software is used to make
visualizations of these properties of the offshore reservoir and make
comparisons and draw similarities between the experimental and estimated
correlated measures. Using interactive plots, different conditions could be
screened, making the analysis more attractive from a user's point of view.
