  guarantees under heavy tails",,,,,"math.ST math.PR stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an estimator of the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ of random
$d$-dimensional vector from an i.i.d. sample of size $n$. Our sole assumption
is that this vector satisfies a bounded $L^p-L^2$ moment assumption over its
one-dimensional marginals, for some $p\geq 4$. Given this, we show that
$\Sigma$ can be estimated from the sample with the same high-probability error
rates that the sample covariance matrix achieves in the case of Gaussian data.
This holds even though we allow for very general distributions that may not
have moments of order $>p$. Moreover, our estimator can be made to be optimally
robust to adversarial contamination. This result improves recent results in the
literature by Mendelson and Zhivotovskiy and Catoni and Giulini, and matches

re-evaluation of the so-called Logistics Objects in Context (LOCO) dataset,
which is the first dataset for object detection in the field of intralogistics.
  Methodology: We use an experimental research approach with three steps to
evaluate the LOCO dataset. Firstly, the images on GitHub were analyzed to
understand the dataset better. Secondly, Google Drive Cloud was used for
training purposes to revisit the algorithmic implementation and training.
Lastly, the LOCO dataset was examined, if it is possible to achieve the same
training results in comparison to the original publications.
  Findings: The mean average precision, a common benchmark in object detection,
achieved in our study was 64.54%, and shows a significant increase from the
initial study of the LOCO authors, achieving 41%. However, improvement
potential is seen specifically within object types of forklifts and pallet
truck.
  Originality: This paper presents the first critical replication study of the
LOCO dataset for object detection in intralogistics. It shows that the training
with better hyperparameters based on LOCO can even achieve a higher accuracy
than presented in the original publication. However, there is also further room
for improving the LOCO dataset.

problem of high utility totally-ordered sequential rule mining and propose two
novel algorithms, called TotalSR and TotalSR+, which aim to identify all high

table that can efficiently calculate antecedent support and a utility prefix

also introduce a left-first expansion strategy that can utilize the
anti-monotonic property to use a confidence pruning strategy. TotalSR can also
drastically reduce the search space with the help of utility upper bounds
pruning strategies, avoiding much more meaningless computation. In addition,
TotalSR+ uses an auxiliary antecedent record table to more efficiently discover
HTSRs. Finally, there are numerous experimental results on both real and

the performance of 42 algorithms including generic object trackers and baseline

show remarkable differences from those grown in platinum crucibles in their
sample characterizations using Raman spectroscopy, resistivity, magnetization,
optical third harmonic generation, resonant X-ray diffraction, and resonant
inelastic X-ray scattering measurements. In particular, we show that several
peaks of sizable intensities disappear in the Raman spectra of samples free of
platinum impurities, and a significantly larger activation energy is extracted
from the resistivity data compared to previously reported values. Furthermore,
we find no evidence of the previously reported glide symmetry breaking
structural distortions and confirm the I41/acd space group of the lattice
symmetry. Although the platinum impurities are not apparent in the magnetic
properties and thus went unnoticed in the stoichiometric insulating phase for a
long time, their effects can be much more detrimental to transport properties

to directly capture nonlinearities inspired by physical quantities, such as

representations of brain graphs derived from functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) data. The majority of existing GNN methods, however, assume
brain graphs are static over time and the graph adjacency matrix is known prior
to model training. These assumptions are at odds with neuroscientific evidence
that brain graphs are time-varying with a connectivity structure that depends
on the choice of functional connectivity measure. Noisy brain graphs that do
not truly represent the underling fMRI data can have a detrimental impact on
the performance of GNNs. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Brain Graph
Structure Learning (DBGSL), a novel method for learning the optimal
time-varying dependency structure of fMRI data induced by a downstream
prediction task. Experiments demonstrate DBGSL achieves state-of-the-art
performance for sex classification using real-world resting-state and task fMRI
data. Moreover, analysis of the learnt dynamic graphs highlights
prediction-related brain regions which align with existing neuroscience

core idea is to leverage a style-based generator to empower high-fidelity and
robust face swapping, thus the generator's advantage can be adopted for
optimizing identity similarity. We identify that with only minimal
modifications, a StyleGAN2 architecture can successfully handle the desired
information from both source and target. Additionally, inspired by the ToRGB
layers, a Swapping-Driven Mask Branch is further devised to improve information
blending. Furthermore, the advantage of StyleGAN inversion can be adopted.
Particularly, a Swapping-Guided ID Inversion strategy is proposed to optimize
identity similarity. Extensive experiments validate that our framework
generates high-quality face swapping results that outperform state-of-the-art
methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

transportation and environmental monitoring. One of the fundamental problems
for time series analysis is time series forecasting. Despite the success of
recent deep time series forecasting methods, they require sufficient
observation of historical values to make accurate forecasting. In other words,
the ratio of the output length (or forecasting horizon) to the sum of the input
and output lengths should be low enough (e.g., 0.3). As the ratio increases
(e.g., to 0.8), the uncertainty for the forecasting accuracy increases
significantly. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that
the uncertainty could be effectively reduced by retrieving relevant time series
as references. In the theoretical analysis, we first quantify the uncertainty
and show its connections to the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Then we prove that
models with references are easier to learn than models without references since
the retrieved references could reduce the uncertainty. To empirically
demonstrate the effectiveness of the retrieval based time series forecasting
models, we introduce a simple yet effective two-stage method, called ReTime
consisting of a relational retrieval and a content synthesis. We also show that
ReTime can be easily adapted to the spatial-temporal time series and time

same shock was detected also by radially aligned Solar Orbiter at 0.8 AU from
the Sun, but no shocklets were identified from its data, introducing the
possibility to study the environment in which shocklets developed. The Wind
spacecraft has been used to characterise the shocklets, associated with
pre-conditioning of the shock upstream by decelerating incoming plasma in the
shock normal direction. Finally, using the Wind observations together with ACE

addressed, and a lower limit for its extent is estimated to be of about 110

to the shock normal. Using multiple spacecraft also reveals that for this

mergers is at the heart of whether massive black holes successfully pair and
merge, leading to emission of low-frequency gravitational waves. The role of
dynamical friction sourced from the gas distribution has been uncertain because
many analytical and numerical studies have either focused on a homogeneous
medium or have not reached resolutions below the scales relevant to the
problem, namely the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton radius. We perform numerical
simulations of a massive black hole moving in a turbulent medium in order to
study dynamical friction from turbulent gas. We find that the black hole slows
down to the sound speed, rather than the turbulent speed, and that the orbital
decay is well captured if the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton radius is resolved with at
least five resolution elements. We find that the larger the turbulent eddies,
the larger the scatter in dynamical friction magnitude, because of the
stochastic nature of the problem, and also of the larger over- and
under-densities encountered by the black hole along its trajectory. Compared to
the classic solution in a homogeneous medium, the magnitude of the force
depends more weakly on the Mach number, and dynamical friction is overall more
efficient for high Mach numbers, but less efficient towards and at the
transonic regime.

frequency of the eddy current approximation of the Maxwell system, is important
for improving current metal detection technologies. Importantly, the upper
frequency limit of the eddy current model depends on the object topology and on
its materials, with the maximum frequency being much smaller for certain
geometries compared to others of the same size and materials. Additionally, the
eddy current model breaks down at much smaller frequencies for highly magnetic
conducting materials compared to non-permeable objects (with similar
conductivities, sizes and shapes) and, hence, characterising small magnetic
objects made of permeable materials using the eddy current at typical
frequencies of operation for a metal detector is not always possible. To
address this, we derive a new asymptotic expansion for permeable highly
conducting objects that is valid for small objects and holds for frequencies
just beyond the eddy current limit. The leading order term we derive leads to
new forms of object characterisations in terms of polarizability tensor object
descriptions where the coefficients can be obtained from solving vectorial

important for safety critical applications, such as the identification of
landmines, unexploded ordnance and concealed weapons. We also expect our

we introduce and test a method for investigating LISA's sensitivity to
gravitational waves from a first order phase transition using parametrised
templates as an approximation to a more complete physical model. The motivation
for developing the method is to provide a less computationally intensive way to
perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference on the thermodynamic
parameters of a first order phase transition, or on generally computationally
intensive models. Starting from a map between the physical parameters and the
parameters of an empirical template, we first construct a prior on the
empirical parameters that contains the necessary information about the physical
parameters; we then use the inverse mapping to reconstruct approximate
posteriors on the physical parameters from a fast MCMC on the empirical
template. We test the method on a double broken power law approximation to
spectra in the sound shell model. The reconstruction method substantially
reduces the proposal evaluation time, and despite requiring some precomputing
of the mapping, this method is still cost-effective overall. In two test cases,
with signal-to-noise $\sim 40$, the method recovers the physical parameters and
the spectrum of the injected gravitational wave power spectrum to $95\%$
confidence. In previous Fisher matrix analysis we found the phase boundary
speed $v_{\rm w}$ was expected to be the best constrained of the thermodynamic
parameters. In this work, for an injected phase transition GW power spectrum
with $v_{\rm w} = 0.55$, with a direct sample on the thermodynamic parameters
we recover $0.630^{+0.17}_{-0.059}$ and for our reconstructed sample
$0.646^{+0.098}_{-0.075}$.

mining. Traditional sequential patterns cannot describe the contrast
information between different classes of data, while contrast patterns
involving the concept of contrast can describe the significant differences
between datasets under different contrast conditions. Based on the number of
papers published in this field, we find that researchers' interest in CPM is
still active. Since CPM has many research questions and research methods. It is
difficult for new researchers in the field to understand the general situation
of the field in a short period of time. Therefore, the purpose of this article
is to provide an up-to-date comprehensive and structured overview of the
research direction of contrast pattern mining. First, we present an in-depth
understanding of CPM, including basic concepts, types, mining strategies, and
metrics for assessing discriminative ability. Then we classify CPM methods
according to their characteristics into boundary-based algorithms, tree-based
algorithms, evolutionary fuzzy system-based algorithms, decision tree-based
algorithms, and other algorithms. In addition, we list the classical algorithms
of these methods and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Advanced
topics in CPM are presented. Finally, we conclude our survey with a discussion
of the challenges and opportunities in this field.

While a liquid-gas transition is expected when such a balance is broken, it
remains elusive whether liquid-gas critical points exist in the quantum regime.
Here we study the quantum criticality in a binary Bose mixture undergoing the
liquid-gas transition. We show that, beyond a narrow stability window of the
self-bound liquid, a liquid-gas coexistence persists, which eventually transits
into a homogeneous mixture. Importantly, we identify two distinct critical
points where the liquid-gas coexistence terminates. These critical points are
characterized by rich critical behaviors in their vicinity, including divergent
susceptibility, unique phonon-mode softening, and enhanced density
correlations. The liquid-gas transition and the critical points can be readily
explored in ultracold atoms confined to a box potential. Our work highlights
the thermodynamic approach as a powerful tool in revealing the quantum
liquid-gas criticality, and paves the way for further studies of critical

application scenarios since it can be scaled to a large number of supports

Wasserstein distance is the average of transportation cost between
one-dimensional representations (projections) of original measures that are
obtained by Radon Transform (RT). Despite its efficiency in the number of
supports, estimating the sliced Wasserstein requires a relatively large number
of projections in high-dimensional settings. Therefore, for applications where
the number of supports is relatively small compared with the dimension, e.g.,
several deep learning applications where the mini-batch approaches are
utilized, the complexities from matrix multiplication of Radon Transform become
the main computational bottleneck. To address this issue, we propose to derive
projections by linearly and randomly combining a smaller number of projections

the approach into a new metric between measures, named Hierarchical Sliced

to be dominated by the inverse Compton scattering of the external sources of
photon fields, e.g., accretion disk, broad-line region (BLR), and torus. FSRQs
show strong optical emission lines and hence can be a useful probe of the
variability in BLR output, which is the reprocessed disk emission. We study the
connection between the optical continuum, H$\gamma$ line, and $\gamma-$ray
emissions from the FSRQ PKS~1222+216, using long-term ($\sim$2011-2018) optical
spectroscopic data from Steward Observatory and $\gamma-$ray observations from
$Fermi$-LAT. We measured the continuum ($F_{C,opt}$) and H$\gamma$
($F_{H\gamma}$) fluxes by performing a systematic analysis of the 6029-6452
\r{A} optical spectra. We observed stronger variability in $F_{C,opt}$ than
$F_{H\gamma}$, an inverse correlation between H$\gamma$ equivalent width and
$F_{C,opt}$, and a redder-when-brighter trend. Using discrete cross-correlation
analysis, we found a positive correlation (DCF$\sim$0.5) between
$F_{\gamma-ray>100MeV}$ and $F_{C,opt}$ (6024-6092 \r{A}) light curves with
time-lag consistent with zero at 2$\sigma$ level. We found no correlation
between $F_{\gamma-ray>100MeV}$ and $F_{H\gamma}$ light curves, probably
dismissing the disk contribution to the optical and $\gamma$-ray variability.
The observed strong variability in the $Fermi$-LAT flux and
$F_{\gamma-ray>100MeV}-F_{C,opt}$ correlation could be due to the changes in
the particle acceleration at various epochs. We derived the
optical-to-$\gamma$-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) during the
$\gamma$-ray flaring and quiescent epochs that show a dominant disk component
with no variability. Our study suggests that the $\gamma$-ray emission zone is
likely located at the edge of the BLR or in the radiation field of the torus.

first efficient, scalable and generalizable framework that can directly search

fundamentally mathematical expressions applied to the gradient. Inspired by the
innate tree structure of the underlying math expressions, we re-arrange the

This way, optimizer search can be naturally formulated as a path-finding
problem, allowing a variety of well-established tree traversal methods to be
used as the search algorithm. We adopt an adaptation of the Monte Carlo method
to tree search, equipped with rejection sampling and equivalent-form detection
that leverage the characteristics of optimizer update rules to further boost
the sample efficiency. We provide a diverse set of tasks to benchmark our
algorithm and demonstrate that, with only 128 evaluations, the proposed

Therefore, many UVMS control methods are kinematics-based, which cannot
inherently account for these effects. Our work bridges the gap between
kinematic control and dynamics by training a recurrent neural network on
simulated UVMS data to predict the pitch of the vehicle in the future based on
the system's previous states. Kinematic planners and controllers can use this
metric to incorporate dynamic knowledge without a computationally expensive
model, improving their ability to perform underwater manipulation tasks.

this work we ask a different basic question: When should algorithms provide

providing algorithmic advice, we propose the design of AI systems that interact
with the human user in a two-sided manner and provide advice only when it is
likely to be beneficial to the human in making their decision. Our AI systems
learn advising policies using past human decisions. Then, for new cases, the
learned policies utilize input from the human to identify cases where
algorithmic advice would be useful, as well as those where the human is better
off deciding alone. We conduct a large-scale experiment to evaluate our
approach by using data from the US criminal justice system on pretrial-release
decisions. In our experiment, participants were asked to assess the risk of
defendants to violate their release terms if released and were advised by
different advising approaches. The results show that our interactive-advising
approach manages to provide advice at times of need and to significantly
improve human decision making compared to fixed, non-interactive advising
approaches. Our approach has additional advantages in facilitating human
learning, preserving complementary strengths of human decision makers, and
leading to more positive responsiveness to the advice.

calculations of the evolution of protoplanetary discs when exposed to FUV
radiation fields from massive stars in the same star-forming regions. In almost
half (44 per cent) of the planetary systems that are disrupted - either
altered, captured, stolen or become free-floating, we find that the radius of
the protoplanetary disc evolves inwards, or the gas in the disc is completely
evaporated, before the planets' orbits are disrupted. This implies that planets
that are disrupted in dense, populous star-forming regions are more likely to
be super Earths or mini Neptunes, as Jovian mass planets would not be able to
form due to mass loss from photoevaporation. Furthermore, the recent
discoveries of distant Jovian mass planets around tightly-packed terrestrial
planets argue against their formation in populous star-forming regions, as
photoevaporation would preclude gas giant planet formation at distances of more
than a few au.

gravitational path integral is an important problem in quantum gravity. In this
paper, we show that, by using supersymmetric localization, the gravitational
path integral for $\frac{1}8$-BPS black holes in $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity
reproduces the index obtained in the string theory construction of such black
holes, including all non-perturbatively suppressed geometries. A more refined
argument then shows that, not only the black hole index, but also the total
number of black hole microstates within an energy window above extremality that
is polynomially suppressed in the charges, also matches this string theory
index.
  To achieve such a match we compute the one-loop determinant arising in the
localization calculation for all $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity supermultiplets
in the $\mathcal{N}=8$ gravity supermultiplet. Furthermore, we carefully
account for the contribution of boundary zero-modes, that can be seen as
arising from the zero-temperature limit of the $\mathcal{N}=4$
super-Schwarzian, and show that performing the exact path integral over such
modes provides a critical contribution needed for the match to be achieved. A
discussion about the importance of such zero-modes in the wider context of all

recover a form of asymptotic $\text{SO}(3)$ rotational equivariance. Through a
sparse tensor implementation we achieve linear scaling in number of pixels on
the sphere for both computational cost and memory usage. For 4k spherical

slow-moving galaxies in the group centre are likely to be tidally disrupted, or

of unique properties of this channel, namely (1) the requirement of stability
during the mass transfer phases, and (2) the complex way in which the final
compact object masses scale with the initial mass. We provide an analytical
expression for the cutoff in the primary component mass and show that this

high-order non-Gaussianity (beyond trispectrum) to be key to describing the

perturbations to be nearly Gaussian in the nonlinear regime of the theory. This

study is that the attenuation of different emission lines can be described by a
single attenuation curve. Here we show this assumption fails in many cases with
important implications for derived results. We developed a new method to
measure the differential nebular attenuation among three kinds of transitions:
the Balmer lines of hydrogen, high-ionization transitions, and low-ionization
transitions. This method bins the observed data in a multidimensional space
spanned by attenuation-insensitive line ratios. Within each small bin, the
variations in line ratios are mainly driven by the variations in the nebular
attenuation. This allows us to measure the nebular attenuation using both
forbidden lines and Balmer lines. We applied this method to a sample of 2.4
million star-forming spaxels from SDSS-IV MaNGA. We found that the attenuation
of high ionization lines and Balmer lines can be well described by a single
Fitzpatrick (1999) extinction curve with $R_V=3.1$. However, no single
attenuation curve can simultaneously account for all three transitions. This
strongly suggests that different lines have different effective attenuations,
likely because spectroscopy at kiloparsec resolutions mixes multiple regions
with different intrinsic line ratios and different levels of attenuation. As a
result, the assumption that different lines follow the same attenuation curve
breaks down. Using a single attenuation curve determined by Balmer lines to
correct attenuation-sensitive forbidden line ratios could bias the nebular
parameters derived by 0.06--0.25 dex at $A_V = 1$, depending on the details of
the dust attenuation model. Observations of a statistically large sample of H
II regions with high spatial resolutions and large spectral coverage are vital
for improved modeling and deriving accurate corrections for this effect.

digit images. Our model showed strong generalization performance against
various image perturbations, on average outperforming all other models
including feedforward CNNs and adversarially trained networks. Our model is
particularly robust to blur, noise, and occlusion corruptions, where shape
perception plays an important role. Ablation studies further reveal two
complementary roles of spatial and feature-based attention in robust object
recognition, with the former largely consistent with spatial masking benefits
in the attention literature (the reconstruction serves as a mask) and the
latter mainly contributing to the model's inference speed (i.e., number of time
steps to reach a certain confidence threshold) by reducing the space of
possible object hypotheses. We also observed that the model sometimes
hallucinates a non-existing pattern out of noise, leading to highly
interpretable human-like errors. Our study shows that modeling
reconstruction-based feedback endows AI systems with a powerful attention
mechanism, which can help us understand the role of generating perception in
human visual processing.

findings tend to overstate the magnitude of real-world phenomena. This bias is
a natural concern for asset pricing research, which has found hundreds of
return predictors and little consensus on their origins.
  Empirical evidence on publication bias comes from large scale meta-studies.
Meta-studies of cross-sectional return predictability have settled on four
stylized facts that demonstrate publication bias is not a dominant factor: (1)
almost all findings can be replicated, (2) predictability persists
out-of-sample, (3) empirical $t$-statistics are much larger than 2.0, and (4)
predictors are weakly correlated. Each of these facts has been demonstrated in
at least three meta-studies.
  Empirical Bayes statistics turn these facts into publication bias
corrections. Estimates from three meta-studies find that the average correction
(shrinkage) accounts for only 10 to 15 percent of in-sample mean returns and
that the risk of inference going in the wrong direction (the false discovery
rate) is less than 6%.
  Meta-studies also find that t-statistic hurdles exceed 3.0 in multiple
testing algorithms and that returns are 30 to 50 percent weaker in alternative
portfolio tests. These facts are easily misinterpreted as evidence of
publication bias effects. We clarify these misinterpretations and others,
including the conflating of ``mostly false findings'' with ``many insignificant
findings.''
  Cross-sectional predictability may not be representative of other fields.
Meta-studies of real-time equity premium prediction suggest a much larger
effect of publication bias, though publication bias in this and other areas of
asset pricing is an important area for future research.

an analytical framework for unpacking the meaning of equity in human-AI

through embedding the high-dimensional temporal information contained in the

spins, which are locally exchange coupled to the (spinful) Haldane model for a
Chern insulator. In the emergent equations of motion for the slow
classical-spin dynamics there is a an additional anomalous geometrical spin
torque, which originates from the corresponding spin-Berry curvature. Due to
the explicitly broken time-reversal symmetry, this is nonzero but usually small

spin-Berry curvature, mainly in the limit of weak exchange coupling, in various
parameter regimes of the Haldane model, particularly close to a topological
phase transition and for spins coupled to sites at the zigzag edge of the model
in a ribbon geometry. The spatial structure of the spin-Berry curvature tensor,
its symmetry properties, the distance dependence of its nonlocal elements and
further properties are discussed in detail. For the case of two classical

this by minimizing the inter- to intra-class similarity ratio to provide
clustering-friendly embedding features, and validate our approach through
comprehensive experiments. Note that, despite only utilizing a simple
clustering algorithm (k-means) in our embedding space to obtain the
pseudo-labels, we achieve significant improvement. Moreover, we adopt a
progressive evaluation mechanism to obtain more diverse samples in order to
further alleviate the limited diversity problem. Finally, our approach is also
model-agnostic and can easily be integrated into existing supervised methods.
To demonstrate its generalization ability, we integrate it into two

most powerful in terms of mass-energy. These EHVOs have been observed at
redshifts 1.052 < z_em < 7.641, but the potential connection with outflows in
emission had not been studied. We find that EHVOs, albeit their small numbers
at the moment, appear to show distinct CIV and HeII properties. In particular,
EHVOs are more predominant in quasars with large blueshifts of the CIV emission
line, suggesting a connection between emission and absorption outflowing
signatures for these extreme outflows. We also find incipient trends with the
maximum velocity of the outflows, which is similar to what has been previously
found in BALQSOs, but now extending previous studies to speeds up to ~0.2c. We
find the bolometric luminosities, Eddington ratios, and black hole masses of
our sample are overall very similar from the general quasar population upon
considering their CIV emission properties. This is close to the case for HeII
EW as we observe a tentative upper limit to the HeII strength for a quasar to
host an EHVO. This study shows that extreme outflows such as EHVOs appear in
quasars that are clearly a distinct class from the overall BALQSO population,
and solidify the relation between outflows observed in emission and in
absorption.

  Learning Inference",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Multi-party computing (MPC) has been gaining popularity over the past years
as a secure computing model, particularly for machine learning (ML) inference.
Compared with its competitors, MPC has fewer overheads than homomorphic
encryption (HE) and has a more robust threat model than hardware-based trusted
execution environments (TEE) such as Intel SGX. Despite its apparent
advantages, MPC protocols still pay substantial performance penalties compared
to plaintext when applied to ML algorithms. The overhead is due to added
computation and communication costs. For multiplications that are ubiquitous in
ML algorithms, MPC protocols add 32x more computational costs and 1 round of
broadcasting among MPC servers. Moreover, ML computations that have trivial
costs in plaintext, such as Softmax, ReLU, and other non-linear operations
become very expensive due to added communication. Those added overheads make
MPC less palatable to deploy in real-time ML inference frameworks, such as
speech translation.
  In this work, we present MPC-Pipe, an MPC pipeline inference technique that
uses two ML-specific approaches. 1) inter-linear-layer pipeline and 2) inner
layer pipeline. Those two techniques shorten the total inference runtime for
machine learning models. Our experiments have shown to reduce ML inference
latency by up to 12.6% when model weights are private and 14.48\% when model
weights are public, compared to current MPC protocol implementations.

as the charge noise that usually foils gate operations can now be leveraged as
an asset in this time-crystal realization. We illustrate differences between
prethermal phenomena and true time-crystalline spatiotemporal order. We
demonstrate that even for a spin chain of four qubits, rich regime structures
can be established by observing signatures of the discrete time crystal and the
Floquet symmetry-protected topological regime both distinct from the thermal

effectiveness of pulse sequences for converting the exchange interaction to an

successively alternate convolutions and downsampling operations, such as

the deeper the network gets. These downsampling operations save computational
resources and provide some translational invariance as well as a bigger
receptive field at the next layers. However, an inherent side-effect of this is
that high-level features, produced at the deep end of the network, are always
captured in low resolution feature maps. The inverse is also true, as shallow
layers always contain small scale features. In biomedical image analysis
engineers are often tasked with classifying very small image patches which
carry only a limited amount of information. By their nature, these patches may
not even contain objects, with the classification depending instead on the
detection of subtle underlying patterns with an unknown scale in the image's
texture. In these cases every bit of information is valuable; thus, it is
important to extract the maximum number of informative features possible.
Driven by these considerations, we introduce a new CNN architecture which
preserves multi-scale features from deep, intermediate, and shallow layers by
utilizing skip connections along with consecutive contractions and expansions
of the feature maps. Using a dataset of very low resolution patches from
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) CT scans we demonstrate that our

Lattice-Boltzmann simulations together with a finite-element based cell model

good qualitative agreement with experimental microscopy images. We show that
for cells flowing in the center of the nozzle extensional stresses can be
significant, while for cells flowing off-center their deformation is dominated
by the shear flow inside the nozzle. From the results of these simulations, we
develop two simple methods that only require the printing parameters (nozzle
diameter, flow rate, bioink rheology) to (i) accurately predict the maximum
cell stress occurring during the 3D bioprinting process and (ii) approximately
predict the cell strains caused by the elongational flow at the nozzle exit.

Martian terrain segmentation has been critical for rover navigation and hazard

searching for organic compounds. Current Martian terrain segmentation models
require a large amount of labeled data to achieve acceptable performance, and
also require retraining for deployment across different domains, i.e. different
rover missions, or different tasks, i.e. geological identification and

leverages unsupervised contrastive pretraining of a backbone for a
multi-mission semantic segmentation for Martian surfaces. This model will
expand upon the current Martian segmentation capabilities by being able to
deploy across different Martian rover missions for terrain navigation, by
utilizing a mixed-domain training set that ensures feature diversity.
Evaluation results of using average pixel accuracy show that a semi-supervised
mixed-domain approach improves accuracy compared to single domain training and
supervised training by reaching an accuracy of 97% for the Mars Science
Laboratory's Curiosity Rover and 79.6% for the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover.
Further, providing different weighting methods to loss functions improved the
models correct predictions for minority or rare classes by over 30% using the

relative stopping power (RSP) distribution within the patient. Currently, RSP
maps are obtained via conventional x-ray computed tomography (CT) by converting
the measured attenuation coefficients of photons into RSP values for ions.
Alternatively, to avoid conversion errors that are inherent to this method, ion
computed tomography (iCT) can be used since it allows determining the RSP
directly. In typical iCT systems, which usually consist of a tracking system
and a separate residual energy detector, the RSP is obtained by measuring the
particle trajectory and the corresponding water equivalent path length (WEPL)
of single ions travelling through the patient. Within this work, we explore a
novel iCT approach which does not require a residual energy detector. Instead,
the WEPL is estimated indirectly by determining the change in time of flight
(TOF) due to the energy loss along the ion's path. For this purpose, we have
created a Geant4 model of a TOF-iCT system based on low gain avalanche
detectors (LGADs), which are fast 4D-tracking detectors that can measure the
time of arrival and position of individual particles with high spatial and time
precision. To assess the performance of this TOF-iCT concept, we determined the
RSP resolution and accuracy for different system settings using the Catphan
CTP404 sensitometry phantom. Within the set of investigated system parameters,
the lower limit of the RSP accuracy was found at 0.91%, demonstrating the
proof-of-principle of this novel TOF-iCT concept. The main advantage of using
this approach is that it could potentially facilitate clinical integration due
to its compact design, which, however, requires experimental verification and
an improvement of the current WEPL calibration procedure.

subject to investigate the molecular chemistry and physical conditions within
photon- and X-ray-dominated regions (PDRs and XDRs). As yet, the exact
formation routes of CO$^+$ and HCO$^+$ in PN environments remain uncertain.
Here, we present $\sim$2$""$ resolution maps of NGC 7027 in the irradiation
tracers CO$^+$ and HCO$^+$, obtained with the IRAM NOEMA interferometer, along
with SMA CO and HST 2.12~$\mu$m H$_2$ data for context. The CO$^+$ map
constitutes the first interferometric map of this molecular ion in any PN.
Comparison of CO$^+$ and HCO$^+$ maps reveal strikingly different emission
morphologies, as well as a systematic spatial displacement between the two
molecules; the regions of brightest HCO$^+$, found along the central waist of
the nebula, are radially offset by $\sim$1$""$ ($\sim$900 au) outside the
corresponding CO$^+$ emission peaks. The CO$^+$ emission furthermore precisely
traces the inner boundaries of the nebula's PDR (as delineated by near-IR H$_2$
emission), suggesting that central star UV emission drives CO$^+$ formation.
The displacement of HCO$^+$ radially outward with respect to CO$^+$ is
indicative that dust-penetrating soft X-rays are responsible for enhancing the
HCO$^+$ abundance in the surrounding molecular envelope, forming an XDR. These
interferometric CO$^+$ and HCO$^+$ observations of NGC 7027 thus clearly
establish the spatial distinction between the PDR and XDR formed (respectively)
by intense UV and X-ray irradiation of molecular gas.

magnetoexciton energies in monolayer dichalcogenides (TMDCs). By the nontrivial

with a magnetic field, we obtain an equation for the relative motion containing
a motional Stark term proportional to the c.m. pseudomomentum, related to the
temperature of the exciton gas but neglected in the previous studies. Solving
the Schr\""odinger equation without omitting the motional Stark potential at
room temperature shows approximately a few meV thermal-magnetic shifts in the
exciton energies, significant enough for experimental detection. Moreover, this
thermal effect causes a change in exciton radius and diamagnetic coefficient
and enhances the exciton lifetime as a consequence. Surprisingly, the
thermoinduced motional Stark potential breaks the system's SO(2) symmetry,
conducting new peaks in the exciton absorption spectra at room temperature

greater than the nominal level. In this paper, we consider tests that satisfy
only a weaker notion of significance level control, in which the probability of
false rejection need only be controlled on average over the hypotheses. We find
that the Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) step-up procedure still controls FDR in
the asymptotic regime with many weakly dependent $p$-values, and that certain

function for velocity, several length scales, the volume filling fraction, the
overlap between different preimages, and fractal dimension of the preimage gas.
Analytic descriptions are found for the PDFs of density and velocity for the

show that gas for one core comes from many turbulent density fluctuations and a
few velocity fluctuations. We find that binary systems have preimages that

calculate the parameters of the stellar configurations with polytropic equation

In order to simplify our analysis we use the equivalent Einstein frame form of
$R^2$-gravity which is basically a scalar-tensor theory with well-known
potential for the scalar field. In this description one can use simple
approximations for the scalar field $\phi$ leaving only the potential term for
it. Our analysis indicates that for the non-relativistic case with $n=3/2$,

stochastic bandit feedback of rewards and safety risks of actions. We study
aggressive \emph{doubly-optimistic play} in SLBs, and their role in avoiding
the strong assumptions and poor efficacy associated with extant
pessimistic-optimistic solutions.
  We first elucidate an inherent hardness in SLBs due the lack of knowledge of
constraints: there exist `easy' instances, for which suboptimal extreme points
have large `gaps', but on which SLB methods must still incur $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$
regret and safety violations due to an inability to refine the location of
optimal actions to arbitrary precision. In a positive direction, we propose and
analyse a doubly-optimistic confidence-bound based strategy for the safe linear
bandit problem, DOSLB, which exploits supreme optimism by using optimistic
estimates of both reward and safety risks to select actions. Using a novel dual
analysis, we show that despite the lack of knowledge of constraints, DOSLB
rarely takes overly risky actions, and obtains tight instance-dependent
$O(\log^2 T)$ bounds on both efficacy regret and net safety violations up to
any finite precision, thus yielding large efficacy gains at a small safety cost
and without strong assumptions. Concretely, we argue that algorithm activates
noisy versions of an `optimal' set of constraints at each round, and activation
of suboptimal sets of constraints is limited by the larger of a safety and

while maintaining user privacy. Its success is to a large part due to its
composition property that guarantees privacy even in the case of multiple data
releases. Consequently, composition has received a lot of attention from the
research community: there exist several composition theorems for adversaries
with different amounts of flexibility in their choice of mechanisms. But apart
from mechanisms, the adversary can also choose the databases on which these
mechanisms are invoked. The classic tool for analyzing the composition of DP
mechanisms, the so-called composition experiment, neither allows for
incorporating constraints on databases nor for different assumptions on the
adversary's prior knowledge about database membership. We therefore propose a
generalized composition experiment (GCE), which has this flexibility. We show
that composition theorems that hold with respect to the classic composition
experiment also hold with respect to the worst case of the GCE. This implies
that existing composition theorems give a privacy guarantee for more cases than
are explicitly covered by the classic composition experiment. Beyond these
theoretical insights, we demonstrate two practical applications of the GCE: the
first application is to give better privacy bounds in the presence of
restrictions on the choice of databases; the second application is to reason
about how the adversary's prior knowledge influences the privacy leakage. In
this context, we show a connection between adversaries with an uninformative
prior and subsampling, an important primitive in DP. To the best of our
knowledge, this paper is the first to analyze the interplay between the
databases in DP composition, and thereby gives both a better understanding of
composition and practical tools for obtaining better composition bounds.

changes its glide plane to another slip plane sharing the same Burgers vector.
The rate at which this process happens is determined by a Boltzmann type
expression that is a function of the screw segment length and the stress acting
on the dislocation. In continuum dislocation dynamics (CDD), the information
regarding the length of the screw dislocation segment and local stress state on
dislocations are lost due to the coarse-grained representation of the density.
In this work, a data driven approach to characterize the lost information by
analyzing the discrete dislocation configurations is proposed to enable
cross-slip modeling in the CDD framework in terms of the coarse-grained
dislocation density and stress fields. The analysis showed that the screw
segment length follows an exponential distribution, and the stress
fluctuations, defined as the difference between the stress on the dislocations
and the mean field stress in CDD, follows a Lorentzian distribution. A novel
approach for cross slip implementation in CDD employing the screw segment
length and stress fluctuation statistics was proposed and rigorously tested by
comparing the CDD cross-slip rates with discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD)
rates. This approach has been applied in conjunction with three cross-slip
models used in DDD simulations differing mainly in the functional form of cross
slip activation energy. It was found that different cross-slip activation
energy formulations yielded different cross-slip rates, yet the effect on
mechanical stress-strain response and dislocation density evolution was minimal
for the [001] type loading.

approximating integrals, for instance in the context of Bayesian inference. In
IS, the samples are simulated from the so-called proposal distribution, and the
choice of this proposal is key for achieving a high performance. In adaptive IS
(AIS) methods, a set of proposals is iteratively improved. AIS is a relevant
and timely methodology although many limitations remain yet to be overcome,
e.g., the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional and multi-modal problems.
Moreover, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm has become increasingly
popular in machine learning and statistics. HMC has several appealing features
such as its exploratory behavior, especially in high-dimensional targets, when
other methods suffer. In this paper, we introduce the novel Hamiltonian
adaptive importance sampling (HAIS) method. HAIS implements a two-step adaptive
process with parallel HMC chains that cooperate at each iteration. The proposed
HAIS efficiently adapts a population of proposals, extracting the advantages of
HMC. HAIS can be understood as a particular instance of the generic layered AIS
family with an additional resampling step. HAIS achieves a significant
performance improvement in high-dimensional problems w.r.t. state-of-the-art

crossings between metastable states is one of broad relevance in physical
sciences. The transition path formalism aims to compute the rate of these
events by analysing the statistical properties of the transition path between
the two metastable regions concerned. In this paper, we show that the
transition path process is a unique solution to an associated stochastic
differential equation (SDE), with a discontinuous and singular drift term. The
singularity arises from a local time contribution, which accounts for the
fluctuations at the boundaries of the metastable regions. The presence of
fluctuations at the local time scale calls for an excursion theoretic
consideration of barrier crossing events. We show that the rate of such events,
as computed from excursion theory, factorizes into a local time term and an
excursion measure term, which bears empirical similarity to the transition
state theory rate expression. Since excursion theory makes no assumption about
the presence of a transition state in the potential energy landscape, the
mathematical structure underlying this factorization ought to be general. We
hence expect excursion theory (and local times) to provide some physical and
mathematical insights in generic barrier crossing problems.

a complex physical structure characterized by an inhomogeneous and clumpy
distribution of the material within this shell. The overall structure can be
described as a prolate ellipsoid with an axial ratio of 1.4$\pm$0.2, a major
axis inclination with the line of sight of $12^{\circ}\pm6^{\circ}$, and polar
and equatorial expansion velocities $\approx$560 km~s$^{-1}$ and 400$\pm$60 km
s$^{-1}$, respectively. The comparison of the expansion velocity on the plane
of the sky with the angular expansion implies a distance of 1.43$\pm$0.23 kpc.
The ionized mass is found to be $\approx 2\times 10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$, noting
that the information on the 3D distribution of material within the nova shell
has allowed us to reduce the uncertainty on its filling factor. The nova shell
is still in its free expansion phase, which can be expected as the ejecta mass
is much larger than the swept-up circumstellar medium mass. The 3D distribution
and radial velocity of material within the nova shell provide an interpretation
of the so-called ""castellated"" line profiles observed in early optical spectra
of nova shells, which can be attributed to knots and clumps moving radially

  This problem, which we refer to as correlation detection in trees, plays a
key role in the study of graph alignment for two correlated random graphs.
Motivated by graph alignment, we investigate the conditions of existence of
one-sided tests, i.e. tests which have vanishing type I error and non-vanishing
power in the limit of large tree depth.
  For the correlated Galton-Watson model with Poisson offspring of mean
$\lambda>0$ and correlation parameter $s \in (0,1)$, we identify a phase
transition in the limit of large degrees at $s = \sqrt{\alpha}$, where $\alpha
\sim 0.3383$ is Otter's constant. Namely, we prove that no such test exists for
$s \leq \sqrt{\alpha}$, and that such a test exists whenever $s >

could also be significant in quantum-gravity research, since they are excellent

spacetime, with the noticeable feature that quantum spacetime would slow down
some of the neutrinos while others would be sped up. Recently the IceCube
collaboration revised significantly the estimates of the direction of
observation of their neutrinos, and we here investigate how the corrected
directional information affects the results of the previous
quantum-spacetime-inspired analyses. We find that there is now no evidence for
neutrinos sped up by quantum-spacetime properties, whereas the evidence for

  MRI",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Deep learning has been demonstrated effective in many
neuroimaging applications. However, in many scenarios, the number of imaging
sequences capturing information related to small vessel disease lesions is
insufficient to support data-driven techniques. Additionally, cohort-based
studies may not always have the optimal or essential imaging sequences for
accurate lesion detection. Therefore, it is necessary to determine which
imaging sequences are crucial for precise detection. This study introduces a
novel deep learning framework to detect enlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS) and
aims to find the optimal combination of MRI sequences for deep learning-based
quantification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We implemented an effective lightweight
U-Net adapted for ePVS detection and comprehensively investigated different
combinations of information from SWI, FLAIR, T1-weighted (T1w), and T2-weighted
(T2w) MRI sequences. The training data included 21 participants, which were
randomly selected from the MESA cohort. Participants had ePVS 683 lesions on
average. For T1w, T2w, and FLAIR images, the MESA study collected 3D isotropic
MRI scans at six different sites with Siemens scanners. Our training data
included participants from all these sites and all the scanner models, and the
proposed model was applied to the whole brain instead of selective regions.
RESULTS: The experimental results showed that T2w MRI is the most important for
accurate ePVS detection, and the incorporation of SWI, FLAIR and T1w MRI in the
deep neural network had minor improvements in accuracy and resulted in the
highest sensitivity and precision (sensitivity =0.82, precision =0.83). The
proposed method achieved comparable accuracy at a minimal time cost compared to
manual reading.

find a wide range 0.02<W<0.09 around an average of W=0.055. The observed albedo
variegation is strongly correlated with nucleus morphology - smooth terrain is
brighter, and consolidated terrain is darker, than average. Furthermore, we
find that smooth terrain darken prior to morphological changes, and that
stratigraphically low terrain (with respect to the centre of each nucleus lobe)
is brighter than stratigraphically high terrain. We propose that the observed
albedo variegation is due to differences in porosity and the coherent effect:
compaction causes small brighter particles to act collectively as larger
optically effective particles, that are darker. Accordingly, we consider the
dark consolidated terrain materials more compacted than smooth terrain
materials, and darkening of the latter is due to subsidence.

collapse dramatically for most applications beyond a handful of qubits. It is
therefore imperative to employ novel techniques that can boost quantum fidelity
in new ways.
  This paper aims to boost quantum fidelity with Clifford canary circuits by
proposing Quancorde: Quantum Canary Ordered Diverse Ensembles, a fundamentally
new approach to identifying the correct outcomes of extremely low-fidelity
quantum applications. It is based on the key idea of diversity in quantum
devices - variations in noise sources, make each (portion of a) device unique,
and therefore, their impact on an application's fidelity, also unique.
  Quancorde utilizes Clifford canary circuits (which are classically simulable,
but also resemble the target application structure and thus suffer similar
structural noise impact) to order a diverse ensemble of devices or
qubits/mappings approximately along the direction of increasing fidelity of the
target application. Quancorde then estimates the correlation of the
ensemble-wide probabilities of each output string of the application, with the
canary ensemble ordering, and uses this correlation to weight the application's
noisy probability distribution. The correct application outcomes are expected
to have higher correlation with the canary ensemble order, and thus their
probabilities are boosted in this process.
  Doing so, Quancorde improves the fidelity of evaluated quantum applications
by a mean of 8.9x/4.2x (wrt. different baselines) and up to a maximum of 34x.

inversion technique, originally developed for geo- and helioseismological

inverting the thermodynamical properties of the solar atmosphere assuming that
the atmosphere and radiation field are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium
(LTE). We leave inversions for magnetic field and non-LTE inversions for future
work. The advantage with the OLA method is that it computes solutions that are
optimally resolved (in depth) with minimal cross-talk error between variables.
Additionally, the method allows for direct assessment of the vertical
resolution of the inverted solutions. The primary challenges faced when
adapting the method to spectroscopic inversions originate with the possible
large amplitude differences between the atmospheric model used to initiate the
inversion and the underlying atmosphere it aims to recover, necessitating the
development of an iterative scheme. Here we describe the iterative OLA method
we have developed for both single and multi-variable inversions and demonstrate
its performance on simulated data and synthesized spectra. We note that when
carrying out multi-variable inversions, employing response function
amplification factors can address the inherent spectral-sensitivity bias that
makes it hard to invert for less spectrally-sensitive variables. The OLA method
can, in most cases, reliably invert as well as or better than the frequently
employed Stokes Inversion based on Response functions (SIR) scheme, however
some difficulties remain. In particular, the method struggles to recover
large-scale offsets in the atmospheric stratification. We propose future
strategies to improve this aspect.

In particular, we leverage model-based control approaches for dynamic bipedal

synthesizing an optimization problem that yields gaits that resemble human
joint trajectories at a kinematic level, and realize these gaits on a

responds to real-time ground reaction forces and interaction forces with the
human. The proposed controller is implemented on a prosthesis for two subjects

the superconducting pairing phases defined on the lattice sites are coupled

the configurations of the color variables, resulting in an extensive entropy.
The resultant color-variable fluctuations kill the PDW order but keep the

1/3-fractional fluxes emerge, due to the mismatch in the color-variable

external magnetic fluxes to lower the free energy. This result is related to

mantle's heat production varying by an order of magnitude and recent particle
physics findings challenge our dominant paradigm. Geologists predict the
earth's budget of radiogenic power at 20$\pm$10 TW, whereas particle physics
experiments predict 15.3$^{+4.9}_{-4.9}$ TW (KamLAND, Japan) and
38.2$^{+13.6}_{-12.7}$ TW (Borexino, Italy).
  We welcome this opportunity to highlight the fundamentally important resource
offered by the physics community and call attention to the shortcomings
associated with the characterization of the geology of the earth. We review the
findings from continent-based, physics experiments, the predictions from
geology, and assess the degree of misfit between the physics measurements and
predicted models of the continental lithosphere and underlying mantle. Because
our knowledge of the continents is somewhat uncertain (7.1$^{+2.1}_{-1.6}$ TW),
models for the radiogenic power in the mantle (3.5 to 32 TW) and the bulk
silicate earth (crust plus mantle) continue to be uncertain by a factor of
$\sim$10 and $\sim$4, respectively. Detection of a geoneutrino signal in the
ocean, far from the influence of continents, offers the potential to resolve
this tension. Neutrino geoscience is a powerful new tool to interrogate the
composition of the continental crust and mantle and its structures.

the observations of gravitational waves emitted from neutron star-black hole

dependence of the drain voltage and saturation current. Numerical simulation
results demonstrate that the effect of drain bias current on the
source-to-drain response voltage (dU) varies with the device channel length. In
a long-channel TeraFET where plasmonic oscillations cannot reach the drain, dU
is always positive and rises rapidly with increasing drain current. For a short
device in which plasmonic oscillations reach the drain, the current-induced
nonuniform electric field leads to a negative response, agreeing with previous
observations. At negative dU, the amplitude of the small-signal voltage at the
drain side becomes larger than that at the source side. Thus, the device
effectively serves as a THz amplifier in this condition. Under the resonant
mode, the negative response can be further amplified near the resonant peaks. A
new expression of dU is proposed to account for this resonant effect. Based on
those expressions, a current-driven TeraFET spectrometer is proposed. The ease
of implementation and simplified calibration procedures make it competitive or
superior compared with other TeraFET-based spectrometers.

multi-level TransUNet (MTU-Net) in this paper. Specifically, we design a Vision
Transformer (ViT) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) hybrid encoder to extract
multi-level features. Local feature maps are first extracted by several
convolution layers and then fed into the multi-level feature extraction module

copy-rotate-resize-paste (CRRP) data augmentation approach to accelerate the
training phase, which effectively alleviates the issue of sample imbalance
between targets and background. Besides, we design a FocalIoU loss to achieve

greatly increase the number of ionizing photons, which would be in serious
conflict with the current cosmic microwave background (CMB) and other
measurements of cosmic reionization history. To solve this problem, we explore
the fuzzy dark matter (FDM), which is composed of ultra-light scalar particles,
e.g. ultra-light axions, and calculate its halo mass function and stellar mass
density for different axion masses. We find that the FDM model with $m_a\simeq

$\sim3\times10^{-23}-10^{-22}\, \rm eV$ can effectively suppress the formation
of small halos and galaxies, so that with higher star formation efficiency,
both the JWST data at $z\sim8$ and the reionization history measurements from
the optical depth of CMB scattering and ionization fraction can be
simultaneously matched. We also find that the JWST data at $z\sim10$ are still
too high to fit in this scenario. We note that the estimated mean redshift of
the sample may have large uncertainty, that it can be as low as $z\sim9$
depending on adopted spectral energy distribution (SED) templates and
photometric-redshift code. Besides, the warm dark matter with $\sim$keV mass
can also be an alternative choice, since it should have similar effects on halo

inter-particle repulsion is strong enough to prevent particle trajectories from
intersecting. We use field theoretic techniques to compute the density profile

results from Monte-Carlo simulations. In both cases we find good agreement

the analytically tractable harmonic chain model (Hessian approximation of the

person feels no gravity to the realization that gravity might be equivalent to
acceleration. It affects all bodies in the same way because it is a property of
spacetime -- its curvature -- not a force propagating through spacetime (like
electromagnetic or nuclear forces). When expressed in a way that is manifestly
independent of the choice of coordinates, this idea became General Relativity.
But the ground for what is now known as the ""equivalence principle"" was laid
long before Einstein, affording a fascinating example of the growth of a
scientific idea through the continuous interplay between theory and experiment.
That story continues through the present era, with improved techniques and
measurements, and in the new environment of space. Theoretically, equivalence
is now understood to rank with Lorentz invariance as one of nature's most
fundamental principles. Violations of equivalence are generically predicted by
attempts to unify gravity with ""non-geometrical"" fundamental interactions, but
there is no consensus on the form that these violations will take. Experimental
tests of equivalence thus face the challenge of striving simultaneously for the
highest possible sensitivity and diversity in test materials.

  Spatiotemporal Traffic Data Recovery","10 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.LG eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traffic data chronically suffer from missing and corruption, leading to
accuracy and utility reduction in subsequent Intelligent Transportation System
(ITS) applications. Noticing the inherent low-rank property of traffic data,
numerous studies formulated missing traffic data recovery as a low-rank tensor
completion (LRTC) problem. Due to the non-convexity and discreteness of the
rank minimization in LRTC, existing methods either replaced rank with convex
surrogates that are quite far away from the rank function or approximated rank
with nonconvex surrogates involving many parameters. In this study, we proposed
a Parameter-Free Non-Convex Tensor Completion model (TC-PFNC) for traffic data
recovery, in which a log-based relaxation term was designed to approximate
tensor algebraic rank. Moreover, previous studies usually assumed the
observations are reliable without any outliers. Therefore, we extended the
TC-PFNC to a robust version (RTC-PFNC) by modeling potential traffic data
outliers, which can recover the missing value from partial and corrupted
observations and remove the anomalies in observations. The numerical solutions
of TC-PFNC and RTC-PFNC were elaborated based on the alternating direction
multiplier method (ADMM). The extensive experimental results conducted on four
real-world traffic data sets demonstrated that the proposed methods outperform
other state-of-the-art methods in both missing and corrupted data recovery. The

solving diverse problems by utilizing Taylor expansions in functional space.
However, achieving a balance between performance and generality has posed a
challenge for GBMs. In particular, gradient descent-based GBMs employ the
first-order Taylor expansion to ensure applicability to all loss functions,
while Newton's method-based GBMs use positive Hessian information to achieve
superior performance at the expense of generality. To address this issue, this
study proposes a new generic Gradient Boosting Machine called Trust-region
Boosting (TRBoost). In each iteration, TRBoost uses a constrained quadratic
model to approximate the objective and applies the Trust-region algorithm to
solve it and obtain a new learner. Unlike Newton's method-based GBMs, TRBoost
does not require the Hessian to be positive definite, thereby allowing it to be
applied to arbitrary loss functions while still maintaining competitive
performance similar to second-order algorithms. The convergence analysis and
numerical experiments conducted in this study confirm that TRBoost is as
general as first-order GBMs and yields competitive results compared to
second-order GBMs. Overall, TRBoost is a promising approach that balances
performance and generality, making it a valuable addition to the toolkit of

optimize high-anxiety pedestrian evacuations. We explore two architectural
layouts, the 1-door vestibule, and the 2-doors vestibule. The ""vestibule"" is
defined as the room next to the exit door and it is characterized by two
structural parameters: the vestibule width ($d$) and the vestibule door width
($w$). We found that, specific values of $d$ and $w$, can almost double the
evacuation flow compared to the no-vestibule scenario. The key to this
achievement is that the density (close to the exit door) can be controlled by
$d$ and $w$. Therefore, it is possible to tune these parameters to a density
that maximizes the available space while preventing the formation of blocking
clusters at the exit door ($\rho \sim 2.5\,$p/m$^2$). As opposed to the optimal
condition, low-density values ($\rho \sim 1\,$p/m$^2$) lead to suboptimal flow
since there is unused space left; while higher density values ($\rho \sim
4\,$p/m$^2$) also lead to suboptimal flow due to the presence of blocking
clusters at the exit. Moreover, we take into account the usually foreseen fact
that high pressures can actually be reached at the exit, threatening the health
of pedestrians. Therefore, we studied the crowd pressure using the agents'
overlap as an indicative. We found that the explored vestibules reduce the
crowd pressure compared to the no-vestibule situation. In particular, we show
that the 2-doors vestibule scenario performs better than the 1-door vestibule,

calibrating the feature maps from these two modalities. The module predicts the

utilizes Modality-Selection (MS) strategy to improve the performance of

With comprehensive experiments on the public DroneVehicle datasets, we verify

excellent performance while accompanied by expensive computational cost. Image
token pruning is one of the main approaches for ViT compression, due to the
facts that the complexity is quadratic with respect to the token number, and
many tokens containing only background regions do not truly contribute to the
final prediction. Existing works either rely on additional modules to score the
importance of individual tokens, or implement a fixed ratio pruning strategy
for different input instances. In this work, we propose an adaptive sparse
token pruning framework with a minimal cost. Our approach is based on learnable
thresholds and leverages the Multi-Head Self-Attention to evaluate token
informativeness with little additional operations. Specifically, we firstly
propose an inexpensive attention head importance weighted class attention
scoring mechanism. Then, learnable parameters are inserted in ViT as thresholds
to distinguish informative tokens from unimportant ones. By comparing token
attention scores and thresholds, we can discard useless tokens hierarchically
and thus accelerate inference. The learnable thresholds are optimized in
budget-aware training to balance accuracy and complexity, performing the
corresponding pruning configurations for different input instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For example, our
method improves the throughput of DeiT-S by 50% and brings only 0.2% drop in

cause significant gaps to the local gradients in each communication round. In
this paper, we propose a Federated Vectorized Averaging (FedVeca) method to
address the above problem on Non-IID data. Specifically, we set a novel
objective for the global model which is related to the local gradients. The
local gradient is defined as a bi-directional vector with step size and
direction, where the step size is the number of local updates and the direction
is divided into positive and negative according to our definition. In FedVeca,
the direction is influenced by the step size, thus we average the
bi-directional vectors to reduce the effect of different step sizes. Then, we
theoretically analyze the relationship between the step sizes and the global
objective, and obtain upper bounds on the step sizes per communication round.
Based on the upper bounds, we design an algorithm for the server and the client
to adaptively adjusts the step sizes that make the objective close to the
optimum. Finally, we conduct experiments on different datasets, models and

provide cost-effective and high-capacity ubiquitous connectivity in the future
wireless communications. In this paper, we investigate the secure transmission
in a terahertz (THz)-empowered reconfigurable intelligent surface
(RIS)-assisted NTN (T-RANTN), which is composed of a low-Earth orbit satellite
transmitter, an RIS-installed high-altitude platform (HAP) and two unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) receivers, only one of which is trustworthy. An
approximate ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) expression is derived when the
atmosphere turbulence and pointing error due to the characteristics of THz as
well as the phase errors resulting from finite precision of RIS and imperfect
channel estimation are taken into account simultaneously. Furthermore,
according to the statistical and perfect channel state information of the
untrustworthy receiver, we optimize the phase shifts of RIS to maximize the
lower bound of secrecy rate (SR) and instantaneous SR, respectively, by using
semidefinite relaxation method. Simulation results show that both the
approximate expression for the ESR and the optimization algorithms are
serviceable, and even when the jitter standard variance of the trustworthy
receiver is greater than that of the untrustworthy one, a positive SR can still
be guaranteed.

the same time as responses and are often prone to measurement error. Naive
last-observation-carried-forward methods incur estimation biases, and existing
kernel-based methods suffer from slow convergence rates and large variations.
To address these challenges, we propose a new functional calibration approach
to efficiently learn longitudinal covariate processes based on sparse
functional data with measurement error. Our approach, stemming from functional
principal component analysis, calibrates the unobserved synchronized covariate
values from the observed asynchronous and error-prone covariate values, and is
broadly applicable to asynchronous longitudinal regression with time-invariant
or time-varying coefficients. For regression with time-invariant coefficients,
our estimator is asymptotically unbiased, root-n consistent, and asymptotically
normal; for time-varying coefficient models, our estimator has the optimal
varying coefficient model convergence rate with inflated asymptotic variance
from the calibration. In both cases, our estimators present asymptotic
properties superior to the existing methods. The feasibility and usability of
the proposed methods are verified by simulations and an application to the
Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, a large-scale multi-site
longitudinal study on women's health during mid-life.

understanding. Recent studies follow a pattern that builds models based on
features instead of raw video picture information. However, we claim those
models are trained complicatedly and limit application scenarios. It is hard
for them to segment human actions of video in real time because they must work
after the full video features are extracted. As the real-time action
segmentation task is different from TAS task, we define it as streaming video
real-time temporal action segmentation (SVTAS) task. In this paper, we propose
a real-time end-to-end multi-modality model for SVTAS task. More specifically,
under the circumstances that we cannot get any future information, we segment
the current human action of streaming video chunk in real time. Furthermore,
the model we propose combines the last steaming video chunk feature extracted
by language model with the current image feature extracted by image model to
improve the quantity of real-time temporal action segmentation. To the best of
our knowledge, it is the first multi-modality real-time temporal action
segmentation model. Under the same evaluation criteria as full video temporal
action segmentation, our model segments human action in real time with less
than 40% of state-of-the-art model computation and achieves 90% of the accuracy
of the full video state-of-the-art model.

axial-vector interaction from the instanton anti-instanton pairing at high
temperature above the chiral phase transition, and vanishes at low temperature.
The chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$ is in the same magnitude as estimated
from the sphaleron transition. Phase transition of the chirality imbalance is
always a first-order one in the early universe with $\mathcal {P}$ and
$\mathcal {CP}$ violation. The spectra of gravitational waves and the formation
of the primordial black holes from this first-order phase transition is
investigated in this work, and the effect of a strong magnetic field is also
analyzed. The gravitational waves produced by chirality imbalance can be
detected by LISA, Taiji and DECIGO, with the peak energy density locating in
the range of $10^{-11}$ to $10^{-9}$ and the peak frequencies lying in the
range of $10^{-5}$ Hz to $10^{-2}$ Hz. The spectrum with larger axial vector
coupling strength and stronger magnetic field has higher peak energy density
and lower peak frequency. According to this trend, the gravitational waves
spectra might also be able to be detected by SKA, IPTA and EPTA. The Phase
transition inverse duration $\beta/H_*$ calculated from the bounce solution is
in the order of $10^4$, which is much higher than typical value $10-100$ from
electroweak phase transitions. Based on the mechanism of postponement of the
false vacuum decay, it is found that the formation of the primordial black hole
is not favored because the phase transition completes in an extreme short time
due to the large value of $\beta/H_*$ and thus the false vacuum energy density
decays sharply.

Previous attempts to combat spam mainly employ features related to metadata,
user behaviors, or relational ties. These works have made considerable progress
in understanding and filtering spamming campaigns. However, this problem
remains far from fully solved. Almost all the proposed features focus on a
limited number of observed attributes or explainable phenomena, making it

Two competitive and highly dissimilar algorithms of latent factors mining (LFM)

the presence of network dynamics and UAVs' multi-dimensional private

UAV cost). Specifically, we first develop a honeypot game between UAVs under
both partial and complete information asymmetry scenarios. We then devise a
contract-theoretic method to solve the optimal VDD-reward contract design
problem with partial information asymmetry, while ensuring truthfulness,
fairness, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, under complete information
asymmetry, we devise a reinforcement learning based distributed method to
dynamically design optimal contracts for distinct types of UAVs in the

is of well-established use in photoelectronic and electronic technology.
However, the vulnerable GaN surface has been a critical restriction that
hinders the development of GaN-based devices, especially regarding device
stability and reliability. Here, we overcome this challenge by converting the
GaN surface into a gallium oxynitride (GaON) epitaxial nanolayer through an
in-situ two-step ""oxidation-reconfiguration"" process. The oxygen plasma
treatment overcomes the chemical inertness of the GaN surface, and the
sequential thermal annealing manipulates the kinetic-thermodynamic reaction
pathways to create a metastable GaON nanolayer with wurtzite lattice. This
GaN-derived GaON nanolayer is a tailored structure for surface reinforcement
and possesses several advantages, including wide bandgap, high thermodynamic
stability, and large valence band offset with GaN substrate. These enhanced
physical properties can be further leveraged to enable GaN-based applications
in new scenarios, such as complementary logic integrated circuits,
photoelectrochemical water splitting, and ultraviolet photoelectric conversion,
making GaON a versatile functionality extender.

geodesics whose ""constants"" of motion evolve slowly with time. The evolution of
these constants of motion can be determined directly from the self-force
equations of motion. In the presence of spacetime symmetries, the situation
simplifies: there exist not only constants of motion conjugate to these
symmetries, but also conserved currents whose fluxes can be used to determine
their evolution. Such a relationship between point-particle motion and fluxes
of conserved currents is a flux-balance law. However, there exist constants of
motion that are not related to spacetime symmetries, the most notable example
of which is the Carter constant in the Kerr spacetime. In this paper, we first
present a new approach to flux-balance laws for spacetime symmetries, using the
techniques of symplectic currents and symmetry operators, which can also
generate more general conserved currents. We then derive flux-balance laws for
all constants of motion in the Kerr spacetime, using the fact that the

derivations in this paper to the scalar self-force problem, although the

with a period of $\sim$9 days. It shows high column density
($N_{H}\sim2-5\times10^{23}$ $cm^{-2}$) in the spectrum, and a large variation
in flux along the orbit despite not being an eclipsing source. We report on
some peculiar timing and spectral features from archival XMM-Newton observation
of this source including 8 observations taken during a single orbit. The pulsar
shows large timing variability in terms of average count rate from different
observations, flaring activity, sudden changes in count rate, cessation of
pulsation, and variable pulse profile even from observations taken a few days
apart. We note that IGR J16320-4751 is among a small number of sources for
which this temporary cessation of pulsation in the light curve has been
observed. A time-resolved spectral analysis around the segment of missing pulse
shows that variable absorption is deriving such behavior in this source. Energy
resolved pulse profiles in the 6.2-6.6 keV band which has a partial
contribution from Fe K$_\alpha$ photons, show strong pulsation. However, a more
systematic analysis reveals a flat pulse profile from the contribution of Fe
K$_\alpha$ photons in this band implying a symmetric distribution for the
material responsible for this emission. Soft excess emission below 3 keV is
seen in 6 out of 11 spectra of XMM-Newton observations.

streamline and optimize urethral plate (UP) quality appraisal on 2D images
using the plate objective scoring tool (POST), aiming to increase the
objectivity and reproducibility of UP appraisal in hypospadias repair. Methods:
The five key POST landmarks were marked by specialists in a 691-image dataset
of prepubertal boys undergoing primary hypospadias repair. This dataset was
then used to develop and validate a deep learning-based landmark detection
model. The proposed framework begins with glans localization and detection,
where the input image is cropped using the predicted bounding box. Next, a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is used to predict the
coordinates of the five POST landmarks. These predicted landmarks are then used
to assess UP quality in distal hypospadias. Results: The proposed model
accurately localized the glans area, with a mean average precision (mAP) of
99.5% and an overall sensitivity of 99.1%. A normalized mean error (NME) of
0.07152 was achieved in predicting the coordinates of the landmarks, with a
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.001 and a 20.2% failure rate at a threshold of
0.1 NME. Conclusions: This deep learning application shows robustness and high
precision in using POST to appraise UP quality. Further assessment using
international multi-centre image-based databases is ongoing. External
validation could benefit deep learning algorithms and lead to better
assessments, decision-making and predictions for surgical outcomes.

with dexterous skills when demonstration can be obtained in robot intrinsic
coordinates. However, the problem of compounding errors in long and complex
skills reduces its wide deployment. Since most such complex skills are composed
of smaller movements that are combined, considering the target skill as a
sequence of compact motor primitives seems reasonable. Here the problem that
needs to be tackled is to ensure that a motor primitive ends in a state that
allows the successful execution of the subsequent primitive. In this study, we
focus on this problem by proposing to learn an explicit correction policy when
the expected transition state between primitives is not achieved. The
correction policy is itself learned via behavior cloning by the use of a
state-of-the-art movement primitive learning architecture, Conditional Neural
Motor Primitives (CNMPs). The learned correction policy is then able to produce
diverse movement trajectories in a context dependent way. The advantage of the
proposed system over learning the complete task as a single action is shown
with a table-top setup in simulation, where an object has to be pushed through
a corridor in two steps. Then, the applicability of the proposed method to
bi-manual knotting in the real world is shown by equipping an upper-body
humanoid robot with the skill of making knots over a bar in 3D space. The
experiments show that the robot can perform successful knotting even when the
faced correction cases are not part of the human demonstration set.

selected set of benchmark instances from physics textbooks. The results
indicate that both algorithms are able to find largely feasible solutions and
NSGA-III provides slight improvements in terms of model quality. Moreover, an

models, video captioning has seen continuous improvement over time. Despite the
performance improvement, video captioning models are prone to hallucination.
Hallucination refers to the generation of highly pathological descriptions that
are detached from the source material. In video captioning, there are two kinds
of hallucination: object and action hallucination. Instead of endeavoring to
learn better representations of a video, in this work, we investigate the
fundamental sources of the hallucination problem. We identify three main
factors: (i) inadequate visual features extracted from pre-trained models, (ii)
improper influences of source and target contexts during multi-modal fusion,
and (iii) exposure bias in the training strategy. To alleviate these problems,
we propose two robust solutions: (a) the introduction of auxiliary heads
trained in multi-label settings on top of the extracted visual features and (b)
the addition of context gates, which dynamically select the features during
fusion. The standard evaluation metrics for video captioning measures
similarity with ground truth captions and do not adequately capture object and
action relevance. To this end, we propose a new metric, COAHA (caption object
and action hallucination assessment), which assesses the degree of
hallucination. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the

an unknown random variable is measured using a gain function applied to the
probability of correctly guessing. In particular, maximal $g$-leakage captures
the multiplicative increase, upon observing $Y$, in the expected gain of an
adversary in guessing a randomized function of $X$, maximized over all such
randomized functions. We show that maximal leakage is an upper bound on maximal
$g$-leakage. We obtain a closed-form expression for maximal $g$-leakage for a
class of concave gain functions. We also study two variants of maximal
$g$-leakage depending on the type of an adversary and obtain closed-form
expressions for them, which do not depend on the particular gain function
considered as long as it satisfies some mild regularity conditions. We do this
by developing a variational characterization for the R\'{e}nyi divergence of
order infinity which naturally generalizes the definition of pointwise maximal
leakage to incorporate arbitrary gain functions. Finally, we study information
leakage in the scenario where an adversary can make multiple guesses by
focusing on maximizing a specific gain function related to $\alpha$-loss. In
particular, we first completely characterize the minimal expected $\alpha$-loss
under multiple guesses and analyze how the corresponding leakage measure is
affected with the number of guesses. We also show that a new measure of
divergence that belongs to the class of Bregman divergences captures the
relative performance of an arbitrary adversarial strategy with respect to an

into account two key factors for improving the performance of the deep image
deblurring model, namely, training data synthesis and network architecture
design. Deblurring models trained on existing synthetic datasets perform poorly
on real blurry images due to domain shift. To reduce the domain gap between
synthetic and real domains, we propose a novel realistic blur synthesis
pipeline to simulate the camera imaging process. As a result of our proposed
synthesis method, existing deblurring models could be made more robust to
handle real-world blur. Furthermore, we develop an effective deblurring model
that captures non-local dependencies and local context in the feature domain
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce the multi-path transformer module to
UNet architecture for enriched multi-scale features learning. A comprehensive
experiment on three real-world datasets shows that the proposed deblurring
model performs better than state-of-the-art methods.

qubits serving as disposable chargers. A stream of identical qubits are
sequentially coupled to a quantum battery of $N+1$ levels and measured by
projective operations after joint unitary evolutions of optimized intervals. If
charger qubits are prepared in excited state and measured on ground state, then
their excitations (energy) can be near-perfectly transferred to battery by
iteratively updating the optimized measurement intervals. Starting from its
ground state, the battery could be constantly charged to an even higher energy
level. Starting from a thermal state, the battery could also achieve a
near-unit ratio of ergotropy and energy through less than $N$ measurements,
when a population inversion is realized by measurements. If charger qubits are
prepared in ground state and measured on excited state, useful work extracted
by measurements alone could transform the battery from a thermal state to a
high-ergotropy state before the success probability vanishes. Our operations in
charging are more efficient than those without measurements and do not invoke
the initial coherence in both battery and chargers. Particularly, our finding

minimize the difference between the similarities of negative pairs and positive
pairs. More specifically, Triplet loss with Hard Negative mining (Triplet-HN),
which is widely used in existing retrieval models to improve the discriminative
ability, is easy to fall into local minima in training. On the other hand,
Vision-Language Contrastive learning loss (VLC), which is widely used in the
vision-language pre-training, has been shown to achieve significant performance
gains on vision-language retrieval, but the performance of fine-tuning with VLC
on small datasets is not satisfactory. This paper proposes a unified loss of

powerful tool for understanding existing loss functions. Our unified loss
includes the hard sample mining strategy of VLC and introduces the margin used
by the triplet loss for better similarity separation. It is shown that both
Triplet-HN and VLC are special forms of our unified loss. Compared with the
Triplet-HN, our unified loss has a fast convergence speed. Compared with the
VLC, our unified loss is more discriminative and can provide better

material and estimating its scattering parameters. A scattering phase function
is one of such parameters which affects the distribution of scattered
radiation. It is the most complex and challenging parameter to be modeled in
practice, and empirical phase functions are usually used. Empirical phase
functions (such as Henyey-Greenstein (HG) phase function or its modified ones)
are usually presented and limited to a specific range of scattering materials.
This limitation raises concern for an inverse rendering problem where the
target material is generally unknown. In such a situation, a more general phase
function is preferred. Although there exists such a general phase function in
the polynomial form using a basis such as Legendre polynomials
\cite{Fowler1983}, inverse rendering with this phase function is not
straightforward. This is because the base polynomials may be negative
somewhere, while a phase function cannot. This research presents a novel
general phase function that can avoid this issue and an inverse rendering
application using this phase function. The proposed phase function was
positively evaluated with a wide range of materials modeled with Mie scattering
theory. The scattering parameters estimation with the proposed phase function
was evaluated with simulation and real-world experiments.

customers who are independently departing between one stage and the next with
known stationary probabilities. In spite of its deceiving structural
simplicity, we are unaware of non-trivial results regarding the rigorous design

simultaneously. We formulate two integrated models based on the flight
connection network, one is the arc-based model, and the other is the
string-based model. The arc-based model makes the flight delay decisions by
duplicating flight copies, and is solved directly by commercial solvers such as
Cplex. The string-based model makes the flight delay decisions in the variable
generation process. The main difficulty of the string-based model is that the
number of constraints grows with the newly generated flight delay decisions.
Therefore, the traditional column generation method can not be applied
directly. To tackle this challenge, we propose a machine learning based
column-and-row generation approach. The machine learning method is used to
uncover the critical delay decisions of short through connections in each
column-and-row generation iteration by eliminating the poor flight delay
decisions. We also propose a set of valid inequality constraints which can
greatly improve the objective of LP relaxation solution and reduce the integral

for resources for their respective expression and may exhibit indirect
regulatory connection; an emergent response thus arises in the system
completely because of resource competition. In this work, we have shown how the
responses of Feed-Forward loop (FFL), a well-studied regulatory genetic motif,
can get recreated considering the resource competition in a three-gene pathway.
The chosen motifs show many of the characteristic features of the conventional
FFL structure, like response delay and pulse generation. This study pinpoints
towards a larger area of research and exploration in synthetic and cellular
systems which will reveal novel controlling ideas and unique behavioral changes
in the system for its context dependencies.

a $SU(2)_L$ singlet vector-like quark (VLQ) with electric charge $Q=+2/3$. The
model also contains an additional local $U(1)_d$ symmetry group and the
corresponding gauge boson is the dark photon. The VLQ is charged while all the
SM particles are neutral under the new $U(1)_d$ gauge group. Even though in
this model the VLQ possesses many properties qualitatively similar to that of
the traditional top partner ($T_p$), there are some compelling differences as
well. In particular, its branching ratio to the traditional modes ($T_p \to bW,
tZ, th$) are suppressed which in turn helps to evade many of the existing
bound, mainly coming from the LHC experiments. In an earlier work, such a VLQ
is referred to as ``maverick top partner"". It has been shown that the top
partner in this model predominantly decays to a top quark and a dark
photon/dark higgs pair ($T_p \to t\gamma_d ,~th_d$) over a large region of the
parameter space. The dark photon can be made invisible and consequently, it
gives rise to the missing transverse energy ($\not\!\!{E} _{T}$) signature at
the LHC detector. We have mainly focused on the LHC signatures and future
prospects of such top partners. In particular, we have studied the
$t\bar{t}+\not\!\!{E}_{T}$ and $t+\not\!\!{E}_{T}$ signatures in the context of
the LHC via pair and single productions of the top partner, respectively at 13
and 14 TeV LHC center of mass energies assuming that the dark photon either
decays into an invisible mode or it is invisible at the length scale of the
detector. We have shown that one can exclude $\sin\theta_L \sim 0.025$ (0.05)

consisting of a bloated extremely low mass pre-white dwarf (pre-ELM WD) and a
compact object with an orbital period of 0.607189~days. The large-amplitude
ellipsoidal variations and the evident Balmer and He~I emission lines suggest a
filled Roche lobe and ongoing mass transfer. No outburst events were detected
in the 15 years of monitoring of J0419, indicating a very low mass transfer
rate. The temperature of the pre-ELM, $T_\mathrm{eff} = 5793_{-133}^{+124}\,\rm
K$, is cooler than the known ELMs, but hotter than most CV donors. Combining
the mean density within the Roche lobe and the radius constrained from our SED
fitting, we obtain the mass of the pre-ELM, $M_1 = 0.176\pm 0.014\,M_\odot$.
The joint fitting of light and radial velocity curves yields an inclination
angle of $i = 66.5_{-1.7}^{+1.4}$ degrees, corresponding to the compact object
mass of $M_2 = 1.09\pm 0.05\,M_\odot$. The very bloated pre-ELM has a smaller
surface gravity ($\log g = 3.9\pm 0.01$, $R_1 = 0.78 \pm 0.02\,R_\odot$) than
the known ELMs or pre-ELMs. The temperature and the luminosity ($L_\mathrm{bol}
= 0.62_{-0.10}^{+0.11}\,L_\odot$) of J0419 are close to the main sequence,
which makes the selection of such systems through the HR diagram inefficient.
Based on the evolutionary model, the relatively long period and small $\log g$
indicate that J0419 could be close to the ""bifurcation period"" in the orbit
evolution, which makes J0419 to be a unique source to connect ELM/pre-ELM WD
systems, wide binaries and cataclysmic variables.

six different and well-known hadronic models for the pure hadronic phase. The
quark phase is described with the MIT Bag model in which the density dependence
of the bag pressure $B(\rho)$ is invoked for different asymptotic values
($B_{as}$) of $B(\rho)$. The resulting hybrid star (HS) configurations exhibit
twin star characteristics and distinct special points (SPs) on the mass-radius

$B_{as}$. We find that for any particular value of $B_{as}$, the mass
corresponding to SP ($M_{SP}$) and the maximum mass ($M_{max}$) of the HSs,
obtained with different hadronic models, follow a nearly linear (fitted)
relationship where the slope is independent of the value of $B_{as}$. The
$M_{SP}-M_{max}$ dependence of the HSs is found to be consistent with any
hadronic equation of state (EoS) chosen to obtain the hybrid EoS and thus such
relations can be considered as universal relations in the context of formation
of SPs. A change in the value of $B_{as}$ shifts the position of the fitted
line in the $M_{SP}-M_{max}$ plane, with the linearity, however, retained.

$\sim[10^{-15}M_\odot,10^{-11}M_{\odot}]$ have been extensively studied as a
candidate of whole dark matter (DM). One of the probes to test such a PBH-DM
scenario is scalar-induced stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) accompanied
with the enhanced primordial fluctuations to form the PBHs with frequency
peaked in the mHz band being targeted by the LISA mission. In order to utilize
the stochastic GWs for checking the PBH-DM scenario, it needs to exactly relate
the PBH abundance and the amplitude of the GWs spectrum. Recently in Kitajima
et al., the impact of the non-Gaussianity of the enhanced primordial curvature
perturbations on the PBH abundance has been investigated based on the peak
theory, and they found that a specific non-Gaussian feature called the
exponential tail significantly increases the PBH abundance compared with the
Gaussian case. In this work, we investigate the spectrum of the induced
stochastic GWs associated with PBH DM in the exponential-tail case. In order to
take into account the non-Gaussianity properly, we employ the diagrammatic
approach for the calculation of the spectrum. We find that the amplitude of the
stochastic GW spectrum is slightly lower than the one for the Gaussian case,
but it can still be detectable with the LISA sensitivity. We also find that the
non-Gaussian contribution can appear on the high-frequency side through their
complicated momentum configurations. Although this feature emerges under the
LISA sensitivity, it might be possible to obtain information about the
non-Gaussianity from GW observation with a deeper sensitivity such as the
DECIGO mission.

are highly complex and optimized programs, often utilizing a parallel
computation model, and there is little prior research on the hardware impact on
prover performance. To alleviate the problem for Isabelle, we initiated a
community benchmark where the build time of HOL-Analysis is measured. On $54$
distinct CPUs, a total of $669$ runs with different Isabelle configurations
were reported by Isabelle users. Results range from $107$s to over $11$h. We
found that current consumer CPUs performed best, with an optimal number of $8$
to $16$ threads, largely independent of heap memory. As for hardware
parameters, CPU base clock affected multi-threaded execution most with a linear
correlation of $0.37$, whereas boost frequency was the most influential
parameter for single-threaded runs (correlation coefficient $0.55$); cache size
played no significant role. When comparing our benchmark scores with popular
high-performance computing benchmarks, we found a strong linear relationship
with Dolfyn ($R^2 = 0.79$) in the single-threaded scenario. Using data from the
3DMark CPU Profile consumer benchmark, we created a linear model for optimal
(multi-threaded) Isabelle performance. When validating, the model has an
average $R^2$-score of $0.87$; the mean absolute error in the final model
corresponds to a wall-clock time of $46.6$s. With a dataset of true median
values for the 3DMark, the error improves to $37.1$s.

Closely related to the short article arXiv:2209.13361",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We do extensive simulations of a simple model of shear-driven jamming in two
dimensions to analyze the velocity distribution at different densities $\phi$
around the jamming density $\phi_J$ and at different low shear strain rates,
$\dot\gamma$. We then find that the velocity distribution is made up of two
parts which are related to two different physical processes which we call the
slow process and the fast process as they are dominated by the slower and the
faster particles, respectively. Earlier scaling analyses have shown that the
shear viscosity $\eta$, which diverges as the jamming density is approached
from below, consists of two different terms and we present strong evidence that
these terms are related to the two different processes: the leading divergence
is due to the fast process whereas the correction-to-scaling term is due to the
slow process. The analysis of the slow process is possible thanks to the
observation that the velocity distribution for different $\dot\gamma$ and
$\phi$ at and around the shear-driven jamming transition, has a peak at low
velocities and that the distribution has a constant shape up to and slightly
above this peak. We then find that it is possible to express the contribution
to the shear viscosity due to the slow process in terms of height and position
of the peak in the velocity distribution and find that this contribution
matches the correction-to-scaling term, determined through a standard critical
scaling analysis. A further observation is that the collective particle motion
is dominated by the slow process. In contrast to the usual picture in critical
phenomena with a direct link between the diverging correlation length and a
diverging order parameter, we find that correlations and shear viscosity
decouple since they are controlled by different sets of particles and that

To accelerate the electron beam to an energy of $\SI{4}{\giga \eV}$, 280 TESLA
type superconducting RF (SRF) cavities are used. A loaded quality factor
($Q_L$) of $4 \times 10^7$ is used to drive the cavities at a power level of a
few kilowatts. For this $Q_L$, the RF cavity bandwidth is 32 Hz. Therefore,
keeping the cavity resonance frequency within such bandwidth is imperative to
avoid a significant increase in the required drive power. In superconducting
accelerators, resonance frequency variations are produced by mechanical
microphonic vibrations of the cavities. One source of microphonic noise is
rotary machinery such as vacuum pumps or HVAC equipment. A possible method to
reject these disturbances is to use Narrowband Active Noise Control (NANC)
techniques. These techniques were already tested at DESY/CMTB and

with such work we studied the dynamics and the steady state of ABP moving on a
substrate with space dependent activity. On the substrate some regions are
marked as high in activity and other regions are such that, particles behave as
passive Brownian particle. The system is studied in one and two dimensions with
Gaussian and uniform distribution of activity profile on the substrate.
Although the microscopic dynamics of ABPs does not involve any alignment
interaction but inhomogeneous activity lead to formation of ordered structure
and current along the interface of the activity profile. The whole interface of
the activity profile is divided symmetrically in two regions. The two regions
have current in two opposite directions in one-dimensional system and two
vortices of opposite helicity in two-dimensions. This lead to the flow of
particles from the active region to the passive region. The final steady state
of particle density profile very much follow the struture of the inhomogeneous
activity. Further we check the steady state density profile for various
different shapes and structure on two-dimensional substrate. Hence the

harvesting data from large photometric surveys. These detections, however, do
not account for potential sources of contamination such as background stars
appearing in the same aperture as the primary target. We present a new method
for identifying the true flare sources in large photometric surveys using data
from the Kepler mission. Potential flares are identified in two steps: first,
we search the light curves for at least two subsequent data points exceeding a
5{\sigma} threshold above the running mean. For these two cadences, we subtract
the ""quiet"" stellar flux from the Kepler pixel data to obtain new images where
the potential flare is the main light source. In the second step, we use a
Bayesian approach to fit the point spread function of the instrument to
determine the most likely location of the flux excess on the detector. We
applied our method to 5862 main-sequence stars with near-solar effective
temperatures. We found 2274 events exceeding the 5-sigma in at least two
consecutive points in the light curves. Applying the second step reduced this
number to 342 superflares. Of these, 283 flares happened on 178 target stars,
47 events are associated with fainter background stars, and in 10 cases, the
flare location cannot be distinguished between the target and a background
star. We also present cases where flares have been reported previously but our
technique could not attribute them to the target star. We conclude that 1)
identifying outliers in the light curves alone is insufficient to attribute
them to stellar flares and 2) flares can only be uniquely attributed to a
certain star when the instrument pixel-level data together with the point
spread function are taken into account. As a consequence, previous flare
statistics are likely contaminated by instrumental effects and unresolved
astrophysical sources.

them relative to a static camera, which acts as the reference frame for the
mocap system. The calibration step has to be done a priori for every capture
session, which is a tedious process, and re-calibration is required whenever
cameras are intentionally or accidentally moved. In this paper, we propose a
mocap method which uses multiple static and moving extrinsically uncalibrated
RGB cameras. The key components of our method are as follows. First, since the
cameras and the subject can move freely, we select the ground plane as a common
reference to represent both the body and the camera motions unlike existing
methods which represent bodies in the camera coordinate. Second, we learn a
probability distribution of short human motion sequences ($\sim$1sec) relative
to the ground plane and leverage it to disambiguate between the camera and
human motion. Third, we use this distribution as a motion prior in a novel
multi-stage optimization approach to fit the SMPL human body model and the
camera poses to the human body keypoints on the images. Finally, we show that
our method can work on a variety of datasets ranging from aerial cameras to
smartphones. It also gives more accurate results compared to the

However, in such dual mobility scenario where the UAV and MGUs are all moving,

robust under various illumination conditions. Then, we build prototypes of
DTact that have non-planar contact surfaces with minimal extra efforts and

from a non-stationary data stream with a single pass through data.
Rehearsal-based methods attempt to approximate the observed input distributions
over time with a small memory and revisit them later to avoid forgetting.
Despite its strong empirical performance, rehearsal methods still suffer from a
poor approximation of the loss landscape of past data with memory samples. This
paper revisits the rehearsal dynamics in online settings. We provide
theoretical insights on the inherent memory overfitting risk from the viewpoint
of biased and dynamic empirical risk minimization, and examine the merits and
limits of repeated rehearsal. Inspired by our analysis, a simple and intuitive
baseline, Repeated Augmented Rehearsal (RAR), is designed to address the
underfitting-overfitting dilemma of online rehearsal. Surprisingly, across four
rather different OCL benchmarks, this simple baseline outperforms vanilla
rehearsal by 9%-17% and also significantly improves state-of-the-art
rehearsal-based methods MIR, ASER, and SCR. We also demonstrate that RAR
successfully achieves an accurate approximation of the loss landscape of past
data and high-loss ridge aversion in its learning trajectory. Extensive
ablation studies are conducted to study the interplay between repeated and
augmented rehearsal and reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to dynamically
adjust the hyperparameters of RAR to balance the stability-plasticity trade-off

stellar formation rate as a function of look-back time. However, the onset of
stellar formation (age of Galactic disc) is sensitive to a variety of input

time-domain surveys. The radial velocity semi-amplitude and orbital period of
the optical visible star are measured by using the Palomar 200-inch telescope
follow-up observations and the light curves from TESS. Thus the mass function
of the invisible candidate white dwarf is derived, $f(M_{\rm{2}}) =
0.120\,\pm\,0.003\,M_{\odot}$. The mass of the visible star is measured based
on the spectral energy distribution fitting, $M_{\mathrm{1}}$ =
$0.81^{+0.07}_{-0.06}\,M_{\odot}$. Hence, the mass of its invisible companion
is $M_{\rm{2}}\,\gtrsim\,0.63\,M_{\odot}$. The companion ought to be a compact
object rather than a main-sequence star owing to the mass ratio $q = M_{\rm{2}}
/ M_{\rm 1} \gtrsim 0.78$ and the single-lined spectra. The compact object is
likely to be a white dwarf except for small inclination angle,
$i\,\lesssim\,40^{\circ}$. By using the GALEX NUV flux, the effective
temperature of the white dwarf candidate is constrained as $T_{\rm eff}^{\rm

outshone by their bright companions via single-epoch optical spectroscopic

the trader repeatedly distributes her capital over $ d $ assets in each of $ T

algorithm, termed Universal Portfolios, that performs nearly as well as the
best (in hindsight) static assignment of a portfolio, with an $ O(d\log(T)) $
regret in terms of the logarithmic return. Without imposing any restrictions on
the market this guarantee is known to be worst-case optimal, and no other
algorithm attaining it has been discovered so far. Unfortunately, Cover's
algorithm crucially relies on computing certain $ d $-dimensional integral
which must be approximated in any implementation; this results in a prohibitive
$ \tilde O(d^4(T+d)^{14}) $ per-round runtime for the fastest known
implementation due to Kalai and Vempala (2002). We propose an algorithm for
online portfolio selection that admits essentially the same regret guarantee as
Universal Portfolios -- up to a constant factor and replacement of $ \log(T) $
with $ \log(T+d) $ -- yet has a drastically reduced runtime of $ \tilde
O(d^2(T+d)) $ per round. The selected portfolio minimizes the current
logarithmic loss regularized by the log-determinant of its Hessian --
equivalently, the hybrid logarithmic-volumetric barrier of the polytope
specified by the asset return vectors. As such, our work reveals surprising
connections of online portfolio selection with two classical topics in

(CNNs) have witnessed remarkable progress for real-time object detection. To
accelerate detection speed, lightweight detectors always have few convolution
layers using single-path backbone. Single-path architecture, however, involves
continuous pooling and downsampling operations, always resulting in coarse and
inaccurate feature maps that are disadvantageous to locate objects. On the
other hand, due to limited network capacity, recent lightweight networks are
often weak in representing large scale visual data. To address these problems,
this paper presents a dual-path network, named DPNet, with a lightweight
attention scheme for real-time object detection. The dual-path architecture
enables us to parallelly extract high-level semantic features and low-level
object details. Although DPNet has nearly duplicated shape with respect to
single-path detectors, the computational costs and model size are not

self-correlation module (LSCM) is designed to capture global interactions, with
only few computational overheads and network parameters. In neck, LSCM is
extended into a lightweight crosscorrelation module (LCCM), capturing mutual
dependencies among neighboring scale features. We have conducted exhaustive
experiments on MS COCO and Pascal VOC 2007 datasets. The experimental results
demonstrate that DPNet achieves state-of the-art trade-off between detection

($\tilde{\ell}\tilde{\ell}$), with each decaying into a charged lepton and a

present an efficient approach to determine a basic topological property of the
parameter region of multistationary, namely whether it is connected or not. The
connectivity of this region can be interpreted in terms of the biological
mechanisms underlying bistability and the switch-like patterns that the system
can create.
  We provide an algorithm to assert that the parameter region of
multistationarity is connected, targeting reaction networks with mass-action
kinetics. We show that this is the case for numerous relevant cell signaling
motifs, previously described to exhibit bistability. However, we show that for
a motif displaying a phosphorylation cycle with allosteric enzyme regulation,
the region of multistationarity has two distinct connected components,
corresponding to two different, but symmetric, biological mechanisms. The
method relies on linear programming and bypasses the expensive computational
cost of direct and generic approaches to study parametric polynomial systems.
This characteristic makes it suitable for mass-screening of reaction networks.

decoupled into two steps. First recognize objects of given categories, and then
generate a sequence for each of these objects. The definition of the output
sequences varies for different tasks, and the model is supervised by matching
these sequences with ground-truth targets. Obj2Seq is able to flexibly
determine input categories to satisfy customized requirements, and be easily
extended to different visual tasks. When experimenting on MS COCO, Obj2Seq

and text for visual grounding. However, the encoder-only grounding framework
(e.g., TransVG) suffers from heavy computation due to the self-attention
operation with quadratic time complexity. To address this issue, we present a
new multimodal transformer architecture, coined as Dynamic MDETR, by decoupling
the whole grounding process into encoding and decoding phases. The key
observation is that there exists high spatial redundancy in images. Thus, we
devise a new dynamic multimodal transformer decoder by exploiting this sparsity
prior to speed up the visual grounding process. Specifically, our dynamic
decoder is composed of a 2D adaptive sampling module and a text-guided decoding
module. The sampling module aims to select these informative patches by
predicting the offsets with respect to a reference point, while the decoding
module works for extracting the grounded object information by performing cross
attention between image features and text features. These two modules are
stacked alternatively to gradually bridge the modality gap and iteratively
refine the reference point of grounded object, eventually realizing the
objective of visual grounding. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks
demonstrate that our proposed Dynamic MDETR achieves competitive trade-offs
between computation and accuracy. Notably, using only 9% feature points in the
decoder, we can reduce ~44% GLOPs of the multimodal transformer, but still get
higher accuracy than the encoder-only counterpart. In addition, to verify its
generalization ability and scale up our Dynamic MDETR, we build the first
one-stage CLIP empowered visual grounding framework, and achieve the
state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks.

self-supervised learning. Existing GCL methods always adopt the
binary-contrastive setting: making binary decisions (positive/negative pairs)
on the generated views, pulling positive (similar) pairs close and pushing
negative (dissimilar) pairs far away. Despite promising performances, two
critical issues arise: (i) the validity of view construction cannot be
guaranteed: graph perturbation may produce invalid views against semantics and
intrinsic topology of graph data; (ii) the binary-contrastive setting is
unreliable: for non-euclidean graph data, positive (similar) pairs and negative
(dissimilar) pairs are very difficult to be decided. The two problems further
raise the research question: Is the binary-contrastive setting really necessary
for graph contrastive learning? In this paper, we investigate this research
question and introduce a novel GCL paradigm, namely Graph Soft-Contrastive
Learning (GSCL), which can conduct graph self-supervise learning via
neighborhood ranking without relying on the binary-contrastive setting.
Specifically, GSCL is built upon the basic assumption of graph homophily that
connected neighbors are more similar than far-distant nodes. Then, under the
GSCL paradigm, we develop pair-wise and list-wise Gated Ranking infoNCE Loss
functions to preserve the relative ranking relationship in the neighborhood.
Moreover, as the neighborhood size exponentially expands with more hops
considered, we propose neighborhood sampling strategies to improve learning
efficiency. Extensive experimental results show that GSCL can achieve
competitive or even superior performance compared with current state-of-the-art
GCL methods. We expect our work can stimulate more research efforts to jump out
of the traditional binary-contrastive setting and conform to the inherent

advanced technologies that increase the number of hacking tools and increase
the risk impact of an attack. The problem of any anomaly-based model is its
high false-positive rate. The high false-positive rate is the reason why
anomaly IDS is not commonly applied in practice. Because anomaly-based models
classify an unseen pattern as a threat where it may be normal but not included
in the training dataset. This type of problem is called overfitting where the
model is not able to generalize. Optimizing Anomaly-based models by having a
big training dataset that includes all possible normal cases may be an optimal
solution but could not be applied in practice. Although we can increase the
number of training samples to include much more normal cases, still we need a
model that has more ability to generalize. In this research paper, we propose
applying deep model instead of traditional models because it has more ability
to generalize. Thus, we will obtain less false-positive by using big data and
deep model. We made a comparison between machine learning and deep learning
algorithms in the optimization of anomaly-based IDS by decreasing the
false-positive rate. We did an experiment on the NSL-KDD benchmark and compared

structures and shapes of crystals, they are limited to unraveling how molecules
aggregate to form crystal nuclei that subsequently transform into bulk
crystals. Computer simulations, mainly molecular dynamics (MD), can provide
such microscopic details during the early stage of a crystallization event.
Crystallization is a rare event that takes place in timescales much longer than
a typical equilibrium MD simulation can sample. This inadequate sampling of the
MD method can be easily circumvented by the use of enhanced sampling (ES)
simulations. An ES method enhances the fluctuations of a system's slow degrees
of freedom, called collective variables (CVs), by applying a bias potential,
and thereby transforms the system from one state to the other within a short
timescale. The most crucial part of an ES method is to find suitable CVs which
often needs intuition and several trial-and-error optimization steps. Over the
years, a plethora of CVs has been developed and applied in the study of
crystallization. In this review, we provide a brief overview of CVs that have
been developed and used in ES simulations to study crystallization from melt or

has recently attracted considerable attention. Despite the success in general
recommendation scenarios, prior methods may fall short of performance
satisfaction for the cold-start problem in which users are associated with very
limited interactive information. Since the conventional methods rely on
exploring the interaction topology, they may however fail to capture sufficient
information in cold-start scenarios. To mitigate the problem, we propose a
novel Knowledge-aware Neural Networks with Personalized Feature Referencing
Mechanism, namely KPER. Different from most prior methods which simply enrich
the targets' semantics from KGs, e.g., product attributes, KPER utilizes the
KGs as a ""semantic bridge"" to extract feature references for cold-start users
or items. Specifically, given cold-start targets, KPER first probes
semantically relevant but not necessarily structurally close users or items as
adaptive seeds for referencing features. Then a Gated Information Aggregation
module is introduced to learn the combinatorial latent features for cold-start
users and items. Our extensive experiments over four real-world datasets show
that, KPER consistently outperforms all competing methods in cold-start
scenarios, whilst maintaining superiority in general scenarios without
compromising overall performance, e.g., by achieving 0.81%-16.08% and
1.01%-14.49% performance improvement across all datasets in Top-10
recommendation.

microlocal tools along the bi-characteristics of the corresponding Hamiltonian.
Their dynamics differ in the continuous and the semi-discrete setting, because
of the high-frequency gap between the Hamiltonians. In particular, numerical
high-frequency solutions can exhibit spurious pathological behaviors, such as
lack of propagation in space, contrary to the classical space-time propagation
properties of continuous waves. This gap between the behavior of continuous and

classical GB constructions cannot be immediately extrapolated to the finite

to present a general and rigorous construction of the GB ansatz for finite

plates to elongated Ahmed bodies. First, global linear stability analysis
yields a series of pitchfork and Hopf bifurcations: (i) at lower Reynolds
numbers $Re$, two stationary modes, $A$ and $B$, become unstable, breaking the
top/bottom and left/right planar symmetries, respectively; (ii) at larger $Re$,
two oscillatory modes become unstable and, again, each mode breaks one of the
two symmetries. The critical $Re$ of these four modes increase with $L/H$,
qualitatively reproducing the trend of stationary and oscillatory bifurcations
in axisymmetric wakes (e.g. thin disk, sphere and bullet-shaped bodies). Next,
a weakly non-linear analysis based on the two stationary modes $A$ and $B$
yields coupled amplitude equations. For Ahmed bodies, as $Re$ increases state
$(A,0)$ appears first, followed by state $(0,B)$. While there is a range of
bistability of those two states, only $(0,B)$ remains stable at larger $Re$,
similar to the static wake deflection (across the larger base dimension)

asteroseismic surface rotation rates found in previous studies. We propose a
new objective function for the Optimally Localized Averages method of
rotational inversions for red-giant stars, which results in more accurate
envelope rotation rate estimates obtained from the same data. We use synthetic
observations from stellar models across a range of evolutionary stages and
masses to demonstrate the improvement. We find that our new inversion technique
allows us to obtain estimates of the surface rotation rate that are independent
of the core rotation. For a star at the base of the red-giant branch, we reduce
the systematic error from about 20% to a value close to 0, assuming constant
envelope rotation. We also show the equivalence between this method and the
method of linearised rotational splittings. Our new rotational inversion method
substantially reduces the systematic errors of red-giant surface rotation
rates. In combination with independent measures of the surface rotation rate,
this will allow better constraints to be set on the internal rotation profile.
This will be a very important probe to further constrain the internal angular

into the traditional method of defining a mission as a series of pre-planned

significance of force usage, we develop a theory of tug-of-war antigen
extraction that maps receptor binding characteristics to clonal reproductive

unifies mechanosensing and affinity-discrimination capabilities of evolving
cells: pulling against stiff antigen tethers enhances discrimination stringency
at the expense of absolute extraction. As a consequence, active force usage can
accelerate adaptation but may also cause extinction of cell populations,

of a billion stars since 2014. The analysis of such a massive dataset is
challenging in terms of the data processing involved. In particular, the blind
detection and characterization of single or multiple companions to stars
(planets, brown dwarfs, or stars) using Gaia astrometry requires highly
efficient algorithms. In this article, we present a set of analytical methods
to detect and characterize companions in scanning space astrometric time series
as well as via a combination of astrometric and radial velocity time series. We
propose a general linear periodogram framework and we derive analytical
formulas for the false alarm probability (FAP) of periodogram peaks. Once a
significant peak has been identified, we provide analytical estimates of all
the orbital elements of the companion based on the Fourier decomposition of the
signal. The periodogram, FAP, and orbital elements estimates can be computed
for the astrometric and radial velocity time series separately or in tandem.
These methods are complementary with more accurate and more computationally
intensive numerical algorithms (e.g., least-squares minimization, Markov chain
Monte Carlo, genetic algorithms). In particular, our analytical approximations
can be used as an initial condition to accelerate the convergence of numerical
algorithms. Our formalism has been partially implemented in the Gaia exoplanet
pipeline for the third Gaia data release. Since the Gaia astrometric time
series are not yet publicly available, we illustrate our methods on the basis
of Hipparcos data, together with on-ground CORALIE radial velocities, for three
targets known to host a companion: HD 223636 (HIP 117622), HD 17289 (HIP
12726), and HD 3277 (HIP 2790).

better protection against future pathogens. Its ability to improve antigen
recognition on the fly relies on somatic mutation and selective expansion of B
lymphocytes expressing high-affinity antigen receptors. However, this Darwinian
process inside an individual appears ineffective, hitting a modest ceiling of
antigen-binding affinity. Experiment began to reveal that evolving B cells
physically extract antigens from presenting cells and that the extraction level
dictates clonal expansion; this challenges the prevailing assumption that the
equilibrium constant of receptor-antigen binding determines selective
advantage. We present a theoretical framework to explore whether, and how, such
tug-of-war antigen extraction impacts the quality and diversity of an evolved B
cell repertoire. We find that the apparent ineffectiveness of clonal selection
can be a direct consequence of the non-equilibrium nature of antigen
recognition. Our theory predicts that the physical strength of antigen
tethering under tugging forces sets the affinity ceiling. Meanwhile, the model
showed that, intriguingly, cells can use force variability to diversify binding
phenotype without compromising fitness, thus remaining plastic under resource
constraint. These results suggest that active probing of receptor quality via a
molecular tug of war during antigen recognition limit the potency of response
to the current antigen, but confer adaptive benefit for protection against
future variants. Importantly, a saddle point in the fitness landscape of B cell
phenotype evolution emerges from the tug-of-war setting, which rationalizes
multiple key phenomenology and puts forward a role of active physical dynamics
in immune adaptation.

Paying attention to the context and the entire sentence help us to detect

emotional words or phrases in the text, particularly when the words express an
emotion implicitly rather than explicitly. On the other hand, focusing only on
the words and ignoring the context results in a distorted understanding of the
sentence meaning and feeling. In this paper, we propose a framework that
analyses text at both the sentence and word levels. We name it CEFER (Context
and Emotion embedded Framework for Emotion Recognition). Our four approach
facets are to extracting data by considering the entire sentence and each
individual word simultaneously, as well as implicit and explicit emotions. The
knowledge gained from these data not only mitigates the impact of flaws in the
preceding approaches but also it strengthens the feature vector. We evaluate
several feature spaces using BERT family and design the CEFER based on them.
CEFER combines the emotional vector of each word, including explicit and
implicit emotions, with the feature vector of each word based on context. CEFER
performs better than the BERT family. The experimental results demonstrate that
identifying implicit emotions are more challenging than detecting explicit
emotions. CEFER, improves the accuracy of implicit emotion recognition.
According to the results, CEFER perform 5% better than the BERT family in
recognizing explicit emotions and 3% in implicit.

for applications in quantum technologies, given the resulting long spin
relaxation time. On the other side, the staggered sub-lattice potential,
resulting from the coupling of graphene with its boron nitride substrate,
compensates intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and decreases the non-trivial
topological gap, which may lead to the phase transition into trivial band

absence of the DeFinetti-Hewitt-Savage theorem for the non-exchangeable case.

  We introduce the Period-Amplitude RatioS (PARS) diagram, a new pulsation
diagnostics independent of distance and reddening. We found that LMC RRds in

also clearly separated in the Petersen and Bailey (luminosity amplitude versus
logarithmic period) diagrams. These circumstantial evidence indicates that the
two groups have different evolutionary properties. All the pulsation
diagnostics adopted in this investigation suggest that old stellar populations
in Fornax and Sculptor dSphs underwent different chemical enrichment histories.
Fornax RRds are similar to SMC RRds, while Sculptor RRds are more similar to

while it does not split MZM zero-bias conductance peak. Secondly, we predict a
dissipation-dependent scaling feature of the zero-bias conductance peak.
Thirdly, the introduced dissipation manifests the MZM signal by suppressing
non-topological CdGM modes. Importantly, the observation of these features does
not require a quantized conductance value $2e^2/h$.

strict internal communication is required between the robots, regardless of the
object size and deformation characteristics. We validate the framework with two
challenging real-world scenarios: co-transportation of a wooden rigid closet
and a bulky box on top of forklift moving straps, with the latter
characterizing deformable objects. In order to evaluate the generalizability of
the proposed framework, a heterogenous team of two mobile manipulators that
consist of an Omni-directional mobile base and a collaborative robotic arm with
different DoFs is chosen for the experiments. The qualitative comparison
between our controller and the baseline controller (i.e., an admittance
controller) during these experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the
proposed framework especially when co-carrying deformable objects. Furthermore,
we believe that the performance of our framework during the experiment with the
lifting straps offers a promising solution for the co-transportation of bulky
and ungraspable objects.

generated in a swimming pool. To investigate this effect, we have numerically
studied the free-surface response of a Lamb-Oseen vortex to small
perturbations. The fluid has finite depth but is laterally unbounded. The
numerical method used is spectrally accurate, and uses a novel non-reflecting
buffer region to simulate a laterally unbounded fluid. While a variety of
linear waves can arise in this flow, we focus here on the surface gravity waves
observed in the swimming pool. We investigate the linear stability of the
vortex as a function of the perturbation azimuthal mode number and the vortex
rotation rate. We find that at low rotation rates, linear modes decay by
radiating energy to the far field, while at higher rotation rates modes become
neutrally stable and trapped in the vicinity of the vortex. In analogy to a
quantum-mechanical system, such states correspond to quasi-bound states, i.e.,
normal modes whose decay rate in time is null and whose corresponding
eigenfunctions remain trapped. Quasi-bound states have previously been seen in
shallow water surface waves due to small perturbations of a bathtub vortex,
although the situation considered here is qualitatively different owing to the
lack of an inward flow. We find that for slow vortex rotation rates, waves
propagate in the opposite direction to the base flow, whereas, above a
threshold rotation rate, waves start co-rotating with the flow as they are
dragged along by the vortex.

not however find a counterpart in the security of such models and corresponding
predictions, where perturbations of fractions of the training set (poisoning)
can seriously undermine the model accuracy. Research on poisoning attacks and
defenses received increasing attention in the last decade, leading to several
promising solutions aiming to increase the robustness of machine learning.
Among them, ensemble-based defenses, where different models are trained on
portions of the training set and their predictions are then aggregated, provide
strong theoretical guarantees at the price of a linear overhead. Surprisingly,
ensemble-based defenses, which do not pose any restrictions on the base model,
have not been applied to increase the robustness of random forest models. The
work in this paper aims to fill in this gap by designing and implementing a
novel hash-based ensemble approach that protects random forest against

measures the performance of our approach against a variety of attacks, as well
as its sustainability in terms of resource consumption and performance, and
compares it with a traditional monolithic model based on random forest. A final

is not known whether there exist LCS in odd dimension, which admit

  Here, we approach this question from a computational perspective. We observe
that every deterministic, non-adaptive measurement-based quantum computation

operators of such a MBQC almost define a quantum solution to the respective
LCS: the only difference is that measurement operators generally only commute

whether this state-dependence can be lifted in certain cases, thus providing
examples of quantum solutions to LCS in odd dimension. Our main result asserts
that no such examples arise within a large extension of the Pauli group for p
odd prime, which naturally arises from and is universal for computation in
deterministic, non-adaptive MBQC with linear side-processing.

objects in binaries with a luminous stellar companion are perfect targets for
optical observations. Candidate compact objects can be achieved by monitoring
the radial velocities of the companion star. However, most of the spectroscopic
telescopes usually obtain stellar spectra at a relatively low efficiency, which
makes a sky survey for millions of stars practically impossible. The efficiency
of a large-scale spectroscopic survey, the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber
Spectroscopy Telescope (LAMOST), presents a specific opportunity to search for
compact object candidates, i.e., simply from the spectroscopic observations.
Late-type K/M stars are the most abundant populations in our Galaxy. Owing to
the relatively large Keplerian velocities in the close binaries with a
K/M-dwarf companion, a hidden compact object could be discovered and
followed-up more easily. In this study, compact object candidates with
K/M-dwarf companions are investigated with the LAMOST low-resolution stellar

collapse of a core with L1544-like properties (in terms of mass and outer
radius), using a state-of-the-art chemical model with a very large chemical
network combined with an extensive description of molecular line cooling,
determined via radiative transfer simulations, with the aim of determining
whether these expansions of the simulation setup (as compared to previous
models) can lead to a higher infall velocity. After running a series of
simulations where the simulation was sequentially simplified, we found that the
infall velocity is almost independent of the size of the chemical network or
the approach to line cooling. We conclude that chemical evolution does not have
a large impact on the infall velocity, and that the higher infall velocities
that are implied by observations may be the result of the core being more
dynamically evolved than what is now thought, or alternatively the average
density in the simulated core is too low. However, chemistry does have a large
influence on the lifetime of the core, which varies by about a factor of two
across the simulations and grows longer when the chemical network is
simplified. Therefore, although the model is subject to several sources of
uncertainties, the present results clearly indicate that the use of a small
chemical network leads to an incorrect estimate of the core lifetime, which is
naturally a critical parameter for the development of chemical complexity in
the precollapse phase.

safety-critical systems that are too complex to formally verify, such as Robot
Operating System 2 (ROS2) applications. Writing correct monitors can itself be
complex, and errors in the monitoring subsystem threaten the mission as a
whole. This paper provides an overview of a formal approach to generating
runtime monitors for autonomous robots from requirements written in a
structured natural language. Our approach integrates the Formal Requirement
Elicitation Tool (FRET) with Copilot, a runtime verification framework, through
the Ogma integration tool. FRET is used to specify requirements with
unambiguous semantics, which are then automatically translated into temporal
logic formulae. Ogma generates monitor specifications from the FRET output,
which are compiled into hard-real time C99. To facilitate integration of the
monitors in ROS2, we have extended Ogma to generate ROS2 packages defining
monitoring nodes, which run the monitors when new data becomes available, and
publish the results of any violations. The goal of our approach is to treat the
generated ROS2 packages as black boxes and integrate them into larger ROS2
systems with minimal effort.

communication protocols. The main advantage is that no manual modeling effort
is required since a behavioral model is automatically inferred from a black-box

the overhead for the establishment of an active interface might hamper the
practical applicability. Our recent work on the active learning of Bluetooth
Low Energy (BLE) protocol found that the active interaction creates a
bottleneck during learning. Considering the automata learning toolset, passive
learning techniques appear as a promising solution since they do not require an
active interface to the system under learning. Instead, models are learned
based on a given data set. In this paper, we evaluate passive learning for two
network protocols: BLE and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Our
results show that passive techniques can correctly learn with less data than
required by active learning. However, a general random data generation for
passive learning is more expensive compared to the costs of active learning.

transmitter, a legitimate user and an eavesdropper, is a classic model for
studying information theoretic secrecy. In this paper, the fundamental problem
for the complex WTC is whether the proper signal is optimal has yet to be given
explicit proof, though previous work implicitly assumed the complex signal was
proper. Thus, a determinant inequality is proposed to prove that the secrecy
rate of a complex Gaussian signal with a fixed covariance matrix in a degraded
complex WTC is maximized if and only if the signal is proper, i.e., the
pseudo-covariance matrix is a zero matrix. Moreover, based on the result of the
degraded complex WTC and the min-max reformulation of the secrecy capacity, the
optimality of the proper signal in the general complex WTC is also revealed.
The results of this research complement the current research on complex WTC. To
be more specific, we have shown it is sufficient to focus on the proper signal
when studying the secrecy capacity of the complex WTC.

proposes a custom code transformation with strength reduction for the matrix
multiplication operations in the interaction-network based GNNs with fully
connected graphs, which avoids the costly multiplication. It exploits sparsity
patterns as well as binary adjacency matrices, and avoids irregular memory
access, leading to a reduction in latency and improvement in hardware
efficiency. In addition, we introduce an outer-product based matrix
multiplication approach which is enhanced by the strength reduction for low

latency. Furthermore, an GNN-specific algorithm-hardware co-design approach is
presented which not only finds a design with a much better latency but also
finds a high accuracy design under a given latency constraint. Finally, a
customizable template for this low latency GNN hardware architecture has been
designed and open-sourced, which enables the generation of low-latency FPGA
designs with efficient resource utilization using a high-level synthesis tool.

including graphs. However contrastive loss, especially for graphs, requires a

prohibitive with a quadratic time complexity. Sub-sampling is not optimal and
incorrect negative sampling leads to sampling bias. In this work, we propose a
meta-node based approximation technique that can (a) proxy all negative
combinations (b) in quadratic cluster size time complexity, (c) at graph level,
not node level, and (d) exploit graph sparsity. By replacing node-pairs with
additive cluster-pairs, we compute the negatives in cluster-time at graph

based on simple optimized GPU operations, captures the full set of negatives,
yet is efficient with a linear time complexity. By avoiding sampling, we
effectively eliminate sample bias. We meet the criterion for larger number of
samples, thus achieving block-contrastiveness, which is proven to outperform
pair-wise losses. We use learnt soft cluster assignments for the meta-node
constriction, and avoid possible heterophily and noise added during edge
creation. Theoretically, we show that real world graphs easily satisfy
conditions necessary for our approximation. Empirically, we show promising
accuracy gains over state-of-the-art graph clustering on 6 benchmarks.
Importantly, we gain substantially in efficiency; up to 3x in training time,
1.8x in inference time and over 5x in GPU memory reduction.

attention both from a theoretical and an operational point of view. Here, we
propose a general framework for dismantling that prioritizes the removal of
nodes that bridge together different network communities. The strategies we
detect are not unique, as they depend on the specific realization of the
community detection algorithm considered. However, when applying the
methodology to some real-world networks we find that the percolation threshold
at which dismantling occurs is strongly robust, and it does not depend on the
specific algorithm. Thus, the stochasticity inherently present in many
community detection algorithms allows to identify several strategies that have
comparable effectiveness but require the removal of distinct subsets of nodes.
This feature is highly relevant in operational contexts in which the removal of
nodes is costly and allows to identify the least expensive strategy that still
holds high effectiveness.

pipeline to create a new model, called Mel and Wave Embeddings for Human Voice
Tasks (MeWEHV), capable of generating robust embeddings for speech processing.
MeWEHV combines the embeddings generated by a pre-trained raw audio waveform
encoder model, and deep features extracted from Mel Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCCs) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We evaluate
the performance of MeWEHV on three tasks: speaker, language, and accent
identification. For the first one, we use the VoxCeleb1 dataset and present
YouSpeakers204, a new and publicly available dataset for English speaker
identification that contains 19607 audio clips from 204 persons speaking in six
different accents, allowing other researchers to work with a very balanced
dataset, and to create new models that are robust to multiple accents. For
evaluating the language identification task, we use the VoxForge and Common
Language datasets. Finally, for accent identification, we use the Latin
American Spanish Corpora (LASC) and Common Voice datasets. Our approach allows
a significant increase in the performance of state-of-the-art models on all the
tested datasets, with a low additional computational cost.

optimal solution than the iterates themselves. And also in the presence of
noise, when a finite termination of the stochastic gradient method is
considered, the arithmetic mean is not necessarily the best possible
approximation to the unknown optimal solution. This paper aims at identifying
optimal strategies in a particularly simple case, the minimization of a
strongly convex function with i. i. d. noise terms and finite termination.
Explicit formulas for the stochastic error and the optimization error are
derived in dependence of certain parameters of the SGD method. The aim was to
choose parameters such that both stochastic error and optimization error are
reduced compared to arithmetic averaging. This aim could not be achieved;
however, by allowing a slight increase of the stochastic error it was possible
to select the parameters such that a significant reduction of the optimization
error could be achieved. This reduction of the optimization error has a strong
effect on the approximate solution generated by the stochastic gradient method
in case that only a moderate number of iterations is used or when the initial
error is large. The numerical examples confirm the theoretical results and
suggest that a generalization to non-quadratic objective functions may be

image recognition area. One of the major challenges in this field is the
scarcity of labelled training data. Additionally, there is often class
imbalance in datasets as some cases are very rare to happen. As a result,
accuracy in classification task is normally low. Deep Learning models, in
particular, show promising results on image segmentation and classification
problems, but they require very large datasets for training. Therefore, there
is a need to generate more of synthetic samples from the same distribution.
Previous work has shown that feature generation is more efficient and leads to
better performance than corresponding image generation. We apply this idea in
the Medical Imaging domain. We use transfer learning to train a segmentation
model for the small dataset for which gold-standard class annotations are
available. We extracted the learnt features and use them to generate synthetic
features conditioned on class labels, using Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN).
We test the quality of the generated features in a downstream classification
task for brain tumors according to their severity level. Experimental results
show a promising result regarding the validity of these generated features and
their overall contribution to balancing the data and improving the
classification class-wise accuracy.

Weighted Contrative Hashing (WCH), to take a step towards solving these two

of information asymmetry in network features caused by the missing image

fine-grained semantic relations between images, i.e., we divide the images into
multiple patches and calculate similarities between patches. The aggregated
weighted similarities, which reflect the deep image relations, are distilled to
facilitate the hash codes learning with a distillation loss, so as to obtain
better retrieval performance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed WCH
significantly outperforms existing unsupervised hashing methods on three

In both interfaces, states from the Heusler penetrate into the gap of the

less than 0.1 $\mu_B$ are induced in the two atomic layers closest to the

the induced spin polarization around the Fermi level of the semiconductor is
the spin polarization around the Fermi level in the Heusler, rather than the

explained by the position of the transition metal $d$ states in the Heusler

proposes a U-net-based method for the segmentation and extraction of specific

to automatically segment specific graphic units according to visual information
and automatically cut out sheet metal parts of corresponding shapes according
to the segmentation results. This process is more efficient than traditional
human-assisted cutting. Two weaknesses in the U-net network will lead to a
decrease in segmentation performance: first, the focus on global semantic
feature information is weak, and second, there is a large dimensional
difference between shallow encoder features and deep decoder features. Based on
the CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) attention mechanism, this paper
proposes a U-net jump structure model with an attention mechanism to improve

understandings devoted to adversarially robust generalization, little is known
from the architectural perspective. To bridge the gap, this paper for the first
time systematically investigated the relationship between adversarially robust
generalization and architectural design. Inparticular, we comprehensively
evaluated 20 most representative adversarially trained architectures on

Based on the extensive experiments, we found that, under aligned settings,
Vision Transformers (e.g., PVT, CoAtNet) often yield better adversarially
robust generalization while CNNs tend to overfit on specific attacks and fail
to generalize on multiple adversaries. To better understand the nature behind
it, we conduct theoretical analysis via the lens of Rademacher complexity. We
revealed the fact that the higher weight sparsity contributes significantly
towards the better adversarially robust generalization of Transformers, which
can be often achieved by the specially-designed attention blocks. We hope our
paper could help to better understand the mechanism for designing robust DNNs.

learning the correlation between the input graphs and labels. However, by
presenting a graph classification investigation on the training graphs with
severe bias, surprisingly, we discover that GNNs always tend to explore the
spurious correlations to make decision, even if the causal correlation always
exists. This implies that existing GNNs trained on such biased datasets will
suffer from poor generalization capability. By analyzing this problem in a
causal view, we find that disentangling and decorrelating the causal and bias
latent variables from the biased graphs are both crucial for debiasing.
Inspiring by this, we propose a general disentangled GNN framework to learn the
causal substructure and bias substructure, respectively. Particularly, we
design a parameterized edge mask generator to explicitly split the input graph
into causal and bias subgraphs. Then two GNN modules supervised by
causal/bias-aware loss functions respectively are trained to encode causal and
bias subgraphs into their corresponding representations. With the disentangled
representations, we synthesize the counterfactual unbiased training samples to
further decorrelate causal and bias variables. Moreover, to better benchmark
the severe bias problem, we construct three new graph datasets, which have
controllable bias degrees and are easier to visualize and explain. Experimental
results well demonstrate that our approach achieves superior generalization
performance over existing baselines. Furthermore, owing to the learned edge
mask, the proposed model has appealing interpretability and transferability.

solar neutrino background signal here at Earth. Past experiments typically use
a large volume central detector looking for energy materializing inside a
detector volume that is not associated with any tracks of particles entering
the volume through the surrounding active veto array and passive shielding.
Here will be presented a new alternative method to see dark matter performing a
search by changing the distance away from the Sun where the 1/r$^2$ law could
be removed from the observations in a known predictable way. A Dark Matter
detector on a spacecraft or built inside an asteroid might be possible. Many
near Earth asteroids that can be easily reached by a spacecraft often have
paths going in to the orbit of Venus and out to almost the orbit of Jupiter.
These asteroids are made of ice, such as Crete, rubble piles of loosely bound
boulders and pebbles, or a combination of the two. Landing on an asteroid where
a space craft could melt its way under the surface for asteroids made mostly of
ice or clawing its way into an asteroid could provide two advantages: shielding
from cosmic and gamma rays and the ice that is melted to tunnel into the
asteroid could become part of a much larger dark matter detector. Both of these
advantages would allow a much larger dark matter detector than could have been

attracts a lot of interest, mainly due to the Van Hove singularity of the
density of states near the band edge. In this paper, we show that there is one
more feature of such a dispersion, which also leads to nontrivial effects. It
consists in the fact that the sign of the effective mass in the momentum space
near the central extremum is opposite to the sign of the mass outside this
region. For this reason, any localized potential that repels quasiparticles in
the outer region attracts quasiparticles in the central region and thereby
creates quasi-bound states. We study these states in the case when the
Mexican-hat dispersion is formed due to the hybridization of the inverted
electron and hole bands, and the potential is created by a point defect. The
energy and width of the resonance of the local density of states corresponding
to a quasi-bound state are found, and it is shown that, under certain
conditions, a quasi-bound state can transform into a bound state in a continuum
of band states. The presence of quasi-bound states leads to nontrivial effects
in the spin-dependent scattering of electrons. Due to the quasi-bound state,
the skew scattering is strongly enhanced for electrons with energy near the
resonance, and the skewness angle varies over a wide range depending on the
energy. In addition, in a certain energy range, a nontrivial effect of
scattering suppression appears in the direction opposite to the skewness angle.

matter halo. Since they imposed a halo profile instead of calculating it from
the trajectories of the shells of dark matter, they were not able to find the
dark matter profile around the splashback radius. In the present paper, we use
an improved spherical infall model taking into shell crossing, and several
physical effects like ordered, and random angular momentum, dynamical friction,
adiabatic contraction, etc. This allow us to determine the density profile from
the inner to outer region, and study the behavior of the outer density profile.
We will compare the density profiles, and the logarithmic slope of the density
profile with the results of Diemer \& Kravtsov (2014) simulations, finding a
good agreement between the prediction of the model and the simulations.

with stochastic resets mimicking non-unitary evolution due to interactions with
the external environment, The driven TBC involves a quantum particle hopping
between the nearest-neighbour sites of a one-dimensional lattice and subject to
an external forcing field that is periodic in time. We consider the resets to
be taking place at exponentially-distributed random times. Using the method of
stochastic Liouville equation, we derive exact results for the probability at a
given time for the particle to be found on different sites and averaged with
respect to different realizations of the dynamics. We establish the remarkable
effect of localization of the TBC particle on the sites of the underlying
lattice at long times. The system in the absence of stochastic resets exhibits
delocalization of the particle, whereby the particle does not have a
time-independent probability distribution of being found on different sites
even at long times, and, consequently, the mean-squared displacement of the
particle about its initial location has an unbounded growth in time. One may
induce localization in the bare model only through tuning the ratio of the
strength to the frequency of the field to have a special value, namely, equal
to one of the zeros of the zeroth order Bessel function of the first kind. We
show here that localization may be induced by a far simpler procedure of
subjecting the system to stochastic resets.

Vector (MMV) problem in the case where only few training samples are available.
Algorithm unfolding has been shown to empirically speed-up in a data-driven way
the convergence of various classical iterative algorithms but for supervised
learning it is important to achieve this with minimal training data. For this
we consider learned block iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (LBISTA)
under different training strategies. To approach almost data-free optimization
at minimal training overhead the number of trainable parameters for algorithm
unfolding has to be substantially reduced. We therefore explicitly propose a
reduced-size network architecture based on the Kronecker structure imposed by
the MMV observation model and present the corresponding theory in this context.
To ensure proper generalization, we then extend the analytic weight approach by
Lui et al to LBISTA and the MMV setting. Rigorous theoretical guarantees and
convergence results are stated for this case. We show that the network weights
can be computed by solving an explicit equation at the reduced MMV dimensions
which also admits a closed-form solution. Towards more practical problems, we
then consider convolutional observation models and show that the proposed
architecture and the analytical weight computation can be further simplified
and thus open new directions for convolutional neural networks. Finally, we
evaluate the unfolded algorithms in numerical experiments and discuss
connections to other sparse recovering algorithms.

communicate by transmitting and listening to a shared channel in discrete time
slots, and a message is successfully delivered to all stations if and only if
its source station is the only transmitter at a time. Despite a vast amount of
work in the last decades, many fundamental questions remain open in the
realistic situation where stations do not start synchronously but are awaken in
arbitrary times. In this work we present a broad picture of results for the
fundamental problem of Contention resolution, in which each of the contending
stations needs to broadcast successfully its message.
  We show that adaptive algorithms or algorithms with the knowledge of the
contention size $k$ achieve a linear $O(k)$ message latency even if the channel
feedback is restricted to simple acknowledgements in case of successful
transmissions and in the absence of synchronization. This asymptotically
optimal performance cannot be extended to other settings: we prove that there
is no non-adaptive algorithm without the knowledge of contention size $k$
admitting latency $o(k\log k/(\log\log k)^2)$. This means, in particular, that
coding (even random) with acknowledgements is not very efficient on a shared
channel without synchronization or an estimate of the contention size. We also
present a non-adaptive algorithm with no knowledge of contention size that
almost matches the lower bound on latency.
  Finally, despite the absence of a collision detection mechanism, we show that
our algorithms are also efficient in terms of energy, understood as the total
number of transmissions performed by the stations during the execution.

other algorithms that run as subroutines. In the case of quantum algorithms, a
subroutine may be called on a superposition of different inputs, which
complicates things. For example, a classical algorithm that calls a subroutine
$Q$ times, where the average probability of querying the subroutine on input
$i$ is $p_i$, and the cost of the subroutine on input $i$ is $T_i$, incurs
expected cost $Q\sum_i p_i E[T_i]$ from all subroutine queries. While this
statement is obvious for classical algorithms, for quantum algorithms, it is
much less so, since naively, if we run a quantum subroutine on a superposition
of inputs, we need to wait for all branches of the superposition to terminate
before we can apply the next operation. We nonetheless show an analogous
quantum statement (*): If $q_i$ is the average query weight on $i$ over all
queries, the cost from all quantum subroutine queries is $Q\sum_i q_i E[T_i]$.
Here the query weight on $i$ for a particular query is the probability of
measuring $i$ in the input register if we were to measure right before the
query.
  We prove this result using the technique of multidimensional quantum walks,
recently introduced in arXiv:2208.13492. We present a more general version of
their quantum walk edge composition result, which yields variable-time quantum
walks, generalizing variable-time quantum search, by, for example, replacing
the update cost with $\sqrt{\sum_{u,v}\pi_u P_{u,v} E[T_{u,v}^2]}$, where
$T_{u,v}$ is the cost to move from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$. The same technique
that allows us to compose quantum subroutines in quantum walks can also be used
to compose in any quantum algorithm, which is how we prove (*).

strategy for convex optimization programs by combining stochastic

noise-additive strategies, which perturb either optimization data or
optimization results, we express the optimization variables as functions of the
random perturbation using linear decision rules; we then optimize these rules
to accommodate the perturbation within the problem's feasible region by
enforcing chance constraints. This way, the perturbation is feasible and makes
different, yet adjacent in the sense of a given distance function, optimization
datasets statistically similar in randomized optimization results, thereby
enabling probabilistic differential privacy guarantees. The chance-constrained
optimization additionally internalizes the conditional value-at-risk measure to
model the tolerance towards the worst-case realizations of the optimality loss
with respect to the non-private solution. We demonstrate the privacy properties

pattern of metal rich and metal poor relative to the median metallicity on the
order of $\lesssim 0.1$~dex, appearing generally in this sample of flocculent
spirals. The pattern persists even in a simulation with different strengths of
metal mixing, indicating that the pattern emerges from physics above the
sub-grid scale. Local enrichment does not appear to be the dominant source of
the azimuthal metallicity variations at $z \approx 0$: there is no correlation
with local star formation on these spatial scales. Rather, the arms are moving
inwards and outwards relative to each other, carrying their local metallicity
gradients with them radially before mixing into the larger-scale interstellar
medium. We propose that the arms act as freeways channeling relatively metal
poor gas radially inwards, and relatively enriched gas radially outwards.

free-fermion chain with a localized loss, which acts as a dissipative impurity.
The chain is initially prepared in a generic Fermi sea. In the standard
hydrodynamic limit of large subsystems and long times, with their ratio fixed,
the negativity between two subsystems is described by a simple formula, which
depends only on the effective absorption coefficient of the impurity. The
negativity grows linearly at short times, then saturating to a volume-law
scaling. Physically, this reflects the continuous production with time of
entangling pairs of excitations at the impurity site. Interestingly, the
negativity is not the same as the R\'enyi mutual information with R\'enyi index
$1/2$, in contrast with the case of unitary dynamics. This reflects the
interplay between dissipative and unitary processes. The negativity content of
the entangling pairs is obtained in terms of an effective two-state mixed
density matrix for the subsystems. Criticality in the initial Fermi sea is
reflected in the presence of logarithmic corrections. The prefactor of the
logarithmic scaling depends on the loss rate, suggesting a nontrivial interplay
between dissipation and criticality.

inner disk of typical late type systems at low redshift. This region has been
the focus of previous statistical studies of colour gradients and has recently
been explored by spectroscopic surveys such as MaNGA. We find the colour
gradients of most galaxies in our sample are negative (redder towards the
centre), consistent with the literature. We investigate empirical relationships
between colour gradient, average $g-r$ and $r-z$ colour, $M_r$, $M_\star$, and
sSFR. Trends of gradient strength with $M_r$ ($M_\star$) show an inflection
around $M_r\sim-21$ ($\log_{10} \, M_\star/\mathrm{M_\odot}\sim10.5$). Below
this mass, colour gradients become steeper with increasing $M_\star$, whereas
colour gradients in more massive galaxies become shallower. We find that
positive gradients (bluer stars at smaller radii) are typical for galaxies of
$M_{\star}\sim10^{8}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$. We compare our results to age and
metallicity gradients in two datasets derived from fits of different stellar
population libraries to MaNGA spectra, but find no clear consensus explanation

representations with great transferability, which achieves promising accuracy
for zero-shot classification. To further improve its downstream performance,
existing works propose additional learnable modules upon CLIP and fine-tune
them by few-shot training sets. However, the resulting extra training cost and
data requirement severely hinder the efficiency for model deployment and
knowledge transfer. In this paper, we introduce a free-lunch enhancement
method, CALIP, to boost CLIP's zero-shot performance via a parameter-free
Attention module. Specifically, we guide visual and textual representations to
interact with each other and explore cross-modal informative features via
attention. As the pre-training has largely reduced the embedding distances
between two modalities, we discard all learnable parameters in the attention
and bidirectionally update the multi-modal features, enabling the whole process
to be parameter-free and training-free. In this way, the images are blended
with textual-aware signals and the text representations become visual-guided
for better adaptive zero-shot alignment. We evaluate CALIP on various
benchmarks of 14 datasets for both 2D image and 3D point cloud few-shot
classification, showing consistent zero-shot performance improvement over CLIP.
Based on that, we further insert a small number of linear layers in CALIP's
attention module and verify our robustness under the few-shot settings, which
also achieves leading performance compared to existing methods. Those extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach for efficient
enhancement of CLIP.

either adjacent to all of $S$ or is nonadjacent to all of $S$) to relate the

scale up an intervention based on the results of an RCT, for example, but
differs from the usual average treatment effect in the presence of spillovers.
We consider both estimation and experimental design given a bound (parametrized
by $\eta > 0$) on the rate at which spillovers decay with the ``distance''
between units, defined in a generalized way to encompass spatial settings,
panel data, and some directed networks. Over all estimators linear in the

are unchanged under the additional assumption, implicit in recent applied
studies, that potential outcomes are linear in population treatment
assignments. An OLS estimator similar (but not identical) to those used in
these studies is consistent and rate-optimal under linearity, and its
finite-sample performance can be improved by incorporating additional
information about the structure of spillovers. As a robust alternative, we also

vortices (PVs), in the process of plasmonic spin-orbit coupling, provide a
promising platform for the realization of many optical vortex-based
applications. Very recently, it has been reported that a single PVL can
generate multiple PVs. This work exploits the representation theory of finite
groups, reveals the symmetry origin of the generated PVs, and derives a new
conservation relation based on symmetry principles. Specifically, the symmetry
principles divide the near field of the PVL into regions, designate integers,
which are the topological charges, to the regions, and, particularly, give an
upper bound to the topological charge of the PV at the center of the PVL.
Further application of the symmetry principles to the spin-orbit coupling
process leads to a new conservation relation. Based on this relation, a
two-step procedure is suggested to link the angular momentum of the incident
field with the one of the generated PVs through the symmetries of the PVL. This
theory is well demonstrated by numerical calculations. This work provides an
alternative but essential symmetry perspective on the dynamics of spin-orbit
coupling in PVLs, forms a strong complement for the physical investigations
performed before, and therefore lays down a solid foundation for flexibly
manipulating the PVs for emerging vortex-based nanophotonic applications.

the possible approaches is self-supervised learning (SSL). In contrast to the
supervised paradigm, this one requires little or no labels for the data.
Nowadays, most SSL approaches are either contrastive or non-contrastive.
Contrastive methods make representations of similar (positive) objects closer
and distancing different (negative) ones. Due to possible wrong marking of
positive and negative pairs, these methods can provide an inferior performance.
Non-contrastive methods don't rely on such labelling and are widespread in
computer vision. They learn using only pairs of similar objects that are easier
to identify in logging data.
  We are the first to introduce non-contrastive SSL for well-logging data. In
particular, we exploit Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) and Barlow Twins
methods that avoid using negative pairs and focus only on matching positive
pairs. The crucial part of these methods is an augmentation strategy. Our
augmentation strategies and adaption of BYOL and Barlow Twins together allow us

marine oil spill accidents severely affect environments, natural resources, and
the lives of coastal inhabitants. Hyperspectral remote sensing images provide
rich spectral information which is beneficial for the monitoring of oil spills
in complex ocean scenarios. However, most of the existing approaches are based
on supervised and semi-supervised frameworks to detect oil spills from
hyperspectral images (HSIs), which require a huge amount of effort to annotate
a certain number of high-quality training sets. In this study, we make the
first attempt to develop an unsupervised oil spill detection method based on
isolation forest for HSIs. First, considering that the noise level varies among
different bands, a noise variance estimation method is exploited to evaluate
the noise level of different bands, and the bands corrupted by severe noise are
removed. Second, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is employed to
reduce the high dimensionality of the HSIs. Then, the probability of each pixel
belonging to one of the classes of seawater and oil spills is estimated with
the isolation forest, and a set of pseudo-labeled training samples is
automatically produced using the clustering algorithm on the detected
probability. Finally, an initial detection map can be obtained by performing
the support vector machine (SVM) on the dimension-reduced data, and then, the
initial detection result is further optimized with the extended random walker
(ERW) model so as to improve the detection accuracy of oil spills. Experiments
on airborne hyperspectral oil spill data (HOSD) created by ourselves
demonstrate that the proposed method obtains superior detection performance
with respect to other state-of-the-art detection approaches.

  overlap with arXiv:2110.05130",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, the efficient quantum error-correction protocol against the
general independent noise is constructed with the three-qubit quantum
error-correction codes. The rules of concatenation are summarized according to
the error-correcting capability of the codes. The codes not only play the role
of correcting errors, but the role of polarizing the effective channel. The
performance of the protocol is dependent on the type of noise and the level of
concatenation. For the general Pauli noise, the threshold of the protocol is
0.91518 when against the depolarizing noise, while for the amplitude damping
noise it is about 0.849. For the general independent noise, the threshold of
the protocol is about 0.932, which is obtained through the numerical
simulations. If there is no limit on the level of concatenation, the
error-correction threshold can be much lower. The physical resources costed by
this protocol is multiple of the physical resources costed by realizing the
three-qubit quantum error-correction, with no increase in complexity. We
believe it will be helpful for realizing quantum error-correction in the
physical system.

overcoming the critical scalability issues faced by existing solutions.
iCOPYWAVES is enabled by emerging PWEs, a recently proposed technology in
wireless communications. Empowered by intelligent (meta)surfaces, PWEs
transform the wave propagation phenomenon into a software-defined process. We
leverage PWEs to i) create, and then ii) selectively copy the scattered RF
wavefront of an object from one location in space to another, where a machine
learning module, accelerated by FPGAs, translates it to visual input for an XR
headset using PWEdriven, RF imaging principles (XR-RF). This makes for an XR
system whose operation is bounded in the physical layer and, hence, has the
prospects for minimal end-to-end latency. Over large distances,
RF-to-fiber/fiber-to-RF is employed to provide intermediate connectivity. The
paper provides a tutorial on the iCOPYWAVES system architecture and workflow. A
proof-of-concept implementation via simulations is provided, demonstrating the
reconstruction of challenging objects in iCOPYWAVES produced computer graphics.

energy density of soft tissues is modeled as a GP, which can be regressed to
experimental stress-strain data obtained from biaxial experiments. Moreover,
the GP model can be weakly constrained to be convex. A key advantage of a
GP-based model is that, in addition to the mean value, it provides a
probability density (i.e. associated uncertainty) for the strain energy
density. To simulate the effect of this uncertainty, a non-intrusive stochastic
finite element analysis (SFEA) framework is proposed. The proposed framework is
verified against an artificial dataset based on the Gasser--Ogden--Holzapfel

noise, the interspike-intervals distribution displays a complex arrangement of
sharp peaks related to the unstable periodic orbits of the chaotic attractor.
For many ranges of parameters controlling the excitability of the system, we
observe that chaotic mixed-mode states consist of lapses of nearly regular
spiking interleaved by others of highly irregular one. We explore here the
emergence of these structures and show their correspondence to the intermittent
transitions to chaos. In fact, the average residence time in the
nearly-periodic firing state, obeys the same scaling law -- as a function of
the control parameter -- than the one at the onset type I intermittency for

that this scenario is also present in a variety of slow-fast neuron models

metrics and, more specifically, the way in which the platform removes ""fake

Working with one and a half year of data extracted from a thousand French
YouTube channels, we show the massive extent of this phenomenon, which concerns
the large majority of the channels and more than half the videos in our corpus.
Our analysis indicates that most fakes news are corrected relatively late in
the life of the videos and that the final view counts of the videos are not
independent from the fake views they received. We discuss the potential harm
that delays in corrections could produce in content diffusion: by inflating
views counts, illegitimate views could make a video appear more popular than it
is and unwarrantedly encourage its human and algorithmic recommendation.
Unfortunately, we cannot offer a definitive assessment of this phenomenon,
because YouTube provides no information on fake views in its API or interface.
This paper is, therefore, also a call for greater transparency by YouTube and
other online platforms about information that can have crucial implications for

Tensorflow.js, DeepVenn automatically finds the optimal solution in which the
overlap between the circles corresponds to the sizes of the overlap as much as

decrease in consistency with increasing temperature near the heated walls
produces a centrifugal radial flow towards the walls. The presence of an
eccentricity induces in turn a significant effect on the main dynamic field and
the stratification of the thermal field. Two cases of upward and downward
eccentricity are treated. These show that an upward shift increases the
stratification of the thermal field, while the stratification begins to weaken
from a certain amount of eccentricity in the case of downward shift. This
represents an important result in terms of possible industrial applications. We
may indeed conclude that an appropriate choice of downward eccentricity can
reduce the thermal stratification, observed experimentally in the case of a
concentric heated annular duct [1], when this stratification is undesirable.
The choice of this eccentricity depends on rheological and thermal properties
of the fluid.

(NLI) for question answering (QA). Typically, NLI systems help answer questions
by determining if a potential answer is \emph{entailed} (supported) by some
background context. But is it useful to also determine if an answer contradicts
the context? We test this in two settings, multiple choice and extractive QA,
and find that systems that incorporate contradiction can do slightly better
than entailment-only systems on certain datasets. However, the best
performances come from using contradiction, entailment, and QA model confidence
scores together. This has implications for the deployment of QA systems in
domains such as medicine and science where safety is an issue.

  Networks","20 pages, 6 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The random walk is one of the most basic dynamic properties of complex
networks, which has gradually become a research hotspot in recent years due to
its many applications in actual networks. An important characteristic of the
random walk is the mean time to absorption, which plays an extremely important
role in the study of topology, dynamics and practical application of complex
networks. Analyzing the mean time to absorption on the regular iterative
self-similar network models is an important way to explore the influence of
self-similarity on the properties of random walks on the network. The existing
literatures have proved that even local self-similar structures can greatly
affect the properties of random walks on the global network, but they have
failed to prove whether these effects are related to the scale of these
self-similar structures. In this article, we construct and study a class of
Horizontal Partitioned Sierpinski Gasket network model based on the classic
Sierpinski gasket network, which is composed of local self-similar structures,
and the scale of these structures will be controlled by the partition
coefficient $k$. Then, the analytical expressions and approximate expressions
of the mean time to absorption on the network model are obtained, which prove
that the size of the self-similar structure in the network will directly
restrict the influence of the self-similar structure on the properties of
random walks on the network. Finally, we also analyzed the mean time to
absorption of different absorption nodes on the network to find the location of
the node with the highest absorption efficiency.
