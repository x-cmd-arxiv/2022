optimally allocate funds of a finite budget into a range of financial
instruments/assets such as stocks. This study investigated the performance of
reinforcement learning (RL) when applied to portfolio management using
model-free deep RL agents. We trained several RL agents on real-world stock
prices to learn how to perform asset allocation. We compared the performance of
these RL agents against some baseline agents. We also compared the RL agents
among themselves to understand which classes of agents performed better. From
our analysis, RL agents can perform the task of portfolio management since they
significantly outperformed two of the baseline agents (random allocation and
uniform allocation). Four RL agents (A2C, SAC, PPO, and TRPO) outperformed the
best baseline, MPT, overall. This shows the abilities of RL agents to uncover
more profitable trading strategies. Furthermore, there were no significant
performance differences between value-based and policy-based RL agents.
Actor-critic agents performed better than other types of agents. Also,
on-policy agents performed better than off-policy agents because they are
better at policy evaluation and sample efficiency is not a significant problem
in portfolio management. This study shows that RL agents can substantially
improve asset allocation since they outperform strong baselines. On-policy,
actor-critic RL agents showed the most promise based on our analysis.

analysis of recent deep imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope. The
identification of candidate stellar members of Boo~I in the photometric catalog
produced from these data was achieved using a Bayesian approach, informed by
complementary archival imaging data for the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.
Additionally, the existence of earlier-epoch data for the fields in Boo~I
allowed us to derive proper motions for a subset of the sources and thus
identify and remove likely Milky Way stars. We were also able to determine the
absolute proper motion of Boo~I, and our result is in agreement with, but
completely independent of, the measurement(s) by \textit{Gaia}. The
best-fitting parameter values of three different forms of the low-mass IMF were
then obtained through forward modeling of the color-magnitude data for likely
Boo~I member stars within an approximate Bayesian computation Markov chain
Monte Carlo algorithm. The best-fitting single power-law IMF slope is $\alpha =
-1.95_{-0.28}^{+0.32}$, while the best-fitting broken power-law slopes are
$\alpha_1 = -1.67_{-0.57}^{+0.48}$ and $\alpha_2 = -2.57_{-1.04}^{+0.93}$. The
best-fitting lognormal characteristic mass and width parameters are
$\rm{M}_{\rm{c}} = 0.17_{-0.11}^{+0.05} \cal M_\odot$ and
$\sigma=0.49_{-0.20}^{+0.13}$. These broken power-law and lognormal IMF
parameters for Boo~I are consistent with published results for the stars within
the Milky Way and thus it is plausible that Bo{\""o}tes I and the Milky Way are

Circular statistics and Rayleigh tests are
important tools for analyzing the occurrence of cyclic events. However, current
methods fail in the presence of measurement bias, such as incomplete or
otherwise non-uniform sampling. Consider, for example, studying 24-cyclicity
but having data not recorded uniformly over the full 24-hour cycle. The
objective of this paper is to present a method to estimate circular statistics
and their statistical significance even in this circumstance.
  Methods. We present our objective as a special case of a more general
problem: estimating probability distributions in the context of imperfect
measurements, a highly studied problem in high energy physics. Our solution
combines 1) existing approaches that estimate the measurement process via
numeric simulation and 2) innovative use of linear parametrizations of the
underlying distributions. We compute the estimation error for several toy
examples as well as a real-world example: analyzing the 24-hour cyclicity of an
electrographic biomarker of epileptic tissue controlled for state of vigilance.
  Results. Our method shows low estimation error. In a real-world example, we
observed the corrected moments had a root mean square residual less than 0.007.
We additionally found that, even with unfolding, Rayleigh test statistics still
often underestimate the p-values (and thus overestimate statistical
significance) in the presence of non-uniform sampling. Numerical estimation of
statistical significance, as described herein, is thus preferable.
  Conclusions. The presented methods provide a robust solution to addressing
incomplete or otherwise non-uniform sampling. The general method presented is
also applicable to a wider set of analyses involving estimation of the true
probability distribution adjusted for imperfect measurement processes.

the reduced system, each scalar field is paired with another, implying that all
multipole modes of the perturbation can be regarded as symmetric partners,
which can be understood from the property of the supersymmetry algebra. The
generator of the supersymmetric structure is constructed from a closed

quantity allows one to show no static response, i.e., vanishing of the Love and
dissipation numbers. We also discuss the vanishing Love numbers of the Kerr
black hole with the nonzero dissipation numbers for the non-axisymmetric
perturbations in terms of a radial constant found in a parallel manner as the
axisymmetric field case even though the interpretation for the structure is
controversial. The symmetric structure corresponds to the ``ladder'' symmetry

different. Our ladder operator includes the generators of hidden symmetries in
previous works.

cranio-caudal (CC) and mediolateral-oblique (MLO) views. These multiple related
images provide complementary diagnostic information and can improve the
radiologist's classification accuracy. Unfortunately, most existing deep
learning systems, trained with globally-labelled images, lack the ability to
jointly analyse and integrate global and local information from these multiple
views. By ignoring the potentially valuable information present in multiple
images of a screening episode, one limits the potential accuracy of these
systems. Here, we propose a new multi-view global-local analysis method that
mimics the radiologist's reading procedure, based on a global consistency
learning and local co-occurrence learning of ipsilateral views in mammograms.
Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms competing methods, in
terms of classification accuracy and generalisation, on a large-scale private
dataset and two publicly available datasets, where models are exclusively
trained and tested with global labels.

targets for current ground- and space-based missions to observe and
characterize. Such model calculations can help to prioritize targets for
observation with current and future missions; however, intrinsic differences in
the complexity and physical parameterizations of various models can lead to
different predictions of a planet's climate state. Understanding such model
differences is necessary if such models are to guide target selection and aid
in the analysis of observations. This paper presents a protocol to intercompare
models of a hypothetical planet with a 15 day synchronous rotation period
around a 3000 K blackbody star across a parameter space of surface pressure and
incident instellation. We conduct a sparse sample of 16 cases from a previously
published exploration of this parameter space with the ExoPlaSim model. By
selecting particular cases across this broad parameter space, the SAMOSA
intercomparison will identify areas where simpler models are sufficient as well
as areas where more complex GCMs are required. Our preliminary comparison using
ExoCAM shows general consistency between the climate state predicted by ExoCAM
and ExoPlaSim except in regions of the parameter space most likely to be in a
steam atmosphere or incipient runaway greenhouse state. We use this preliminary
analysis to define several options for participation in the intercomparison by
models of all levels of complexity. The participation of other GCMs is crucial
to understand how the atmospheric states across this parameter space differ
with model capabilities.

rich physical and chemical properties where their surface termination plays an
essential role. Among the various 2D MXenes, functionalization of the
Ti$_{n}$C$_{n-1}$ phase with oxygen (O) atoms makes them attractive for
optoelectronic applications due to their optical gap residing in the infrared
or visible region. In this manuscript, we theoretically investigate the
electronic and optical properties of four different O-atom-functionalized
Ti$_{n}$C$_{n-1}$ MXene monolayers using state-of-the-art, first-principles
techniques. In particular, we calculate the quasiparticle corrections on top of
density functional theory (DFT) at the GW level and the exciton-dominated
optical spectra by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) also at finite
momentum. We find that all but one of the monolayer models are indirect band
gap semiconductors where quasiparticle corrections are very important ($\sim 1$
eV). The optical spectra are instead dominated by direct and indirect excitons
with large binding energies (between $0.5$ and $1$ eV). Most direct excitons
lie above $1.5$ eV, while the indirect ones are below: therefore, we conclude
that Ti$_{n}$C$_{n-1}$ should display strong absorption in the visible region,
but phonon-assisted emission in the infrared. Our work thus reveals the
potential usage of surface terminations to tune the optical and electronic
properties of Ti$_{n}$C$_{n-1}$ MXene monolayers, while emphasizing the pivotal
role of many-body effects beyond DFT to obtain accurate prediction for these

evolution of knowledge. In software engineering (SE), there are several
classifications that describe the nature of SE research. Regarding the
consolidation of the large body of classified knowledge in SE research, a
generally applicable classification scheme is crucial. Moreover, the
commonalities and differences among different classification schemes have
rarely been studied. Due to the fact that classifications are documented
textual, it is hard to catalog, reuse, and compare them. To the best of our
knowledge, there is no research work so far that addresses documentation and
systematic investigation of classifications in SE meta-research. Objective: We
aim to construct a unified, generally applicable classification scheme for SE
meta-research by collecting and documenting existing classification schemes and
unifying their classes and categories. Method: Our execution plan is divided
into three phases: construction, validation, and evaluation phase. For the
construction phase, we perform a literature review to identify, collect, and
analyze a set of established SE research classifications. In the validation
phase, we analyze individual categories and classes of included papers. We use
quantitative metrics from literature to conduct and assess the unification
process to build a generally applicable classification scheme for SE research.
Lastly, we investigate the applicability of the unified scheme. Therefore, we
perform a workshop session followed by user studies w.r.t. investigations about
reliability, correctness, and ease of use.

Edges represent different modular operations involved in summarization such as
sentence fusion, compression, and paraphrasing. We first propose an efficient
best-first search method over neural modules, SP-Search that identifies SPs for
human summaries by directly optimizing for ROUGE scores. Next, using these
programs as automatic supervision, we propose seq2seq models that generate
Summarization Programs, which are then executed to obtain final summaries. We
demonstrate that SP-Search effectively represents the generative process behind
human summaries using modules that are typically faithful to their intended
behavior. We also conduct a simulation study to show that Summarization
Programs improve the interpretability of summarization models by allowing
humans to better simulate model reasoning. Summarization Programs constitute a

  Several topologies of the impedance connection between swarm units were
investigated in this research. The experiment, in which drones performed a
point following task on a square trajectory in real-time, revealed that drones
connected in a Star topology performed the trajectory with low mean positional
error (RMSE decreased by 20.6% in comparison with other impedance topologies
and by 40.9% in comparison with potential field-based swarm control). The
achieved velocities of the drones in all formations with impedance behavior
were 28% higher than for the swarm controlled with the potential field
algorithm.
  Additionally, the perception of several vibrotactile patterns was evaluated
in a user study with 7 participants. The study has shown that the proposed
combination of temporal delay and frequency modulation allows users to
successfully recognize the surface property and motion direction in VR
simultaneously (mean recognition rate of 70%, maximum of 93%). DandelionTouch
suggests a new type of haptic feedback in VR systems where no hand-held or

approach is to supervise the training of deep neural networks with a
high-fidelity dataset of desired input-output pairs, captured with a light
stage. However, acquiring such data requires an expensive special capture rig
and time-consuming efforts, limiting access to only a few resourceful
laboratories. To address the limitation, we propose a new approach that can
perform on par with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) relighting methods without
requiring a light stage. Our approach is based on the realization that a
successful relighting of a portrait image depends on two conditions. First, the
method needs to mimic the behaviors of physically-based relighting. Second, the
output has to be photorealistic. To meet the first condition, we propose to
train the relighting network with training data generated by a virtual light
stage that performs physically-based rendering on various 3D synthetic humans
under different environment maps. To meet the second condition, we develop a
novel synthetic-to-real approach to bring photorealism to the relighting
network output. In addition to achieving SOTA results, our approach offers
several advantages over the prior methods, including controllable glares on

However, in many important scenarios such as search and rescue, exploration,
disaster-management, war-field, etc., on-the-fly allocation of the dynamic
tasks to the robots in a decentralized fashion is the only possible option.
Efficient communication among the robots plays a crucial role in any such
decentralized setting. Existing works on distributed Multi-Robot Task
Allocation (MRTA) either assume that the network is available or a naive
communication paradigm is used. On the contrary, in most of these scenarios,
the network infrastructure is either unstable or unavailable and ad-hoc
networking is the only resort. Recent developments in synchronous-transmission
(ST) based wireless communication protocols are shown to be more efficient than
the traditional asynchronous transmission-based protocols in ad hoc networks
such as Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)/Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
The current work is the first effort that utilizes ST for MRTA. Specifically,
we propose an algorithm that efficiently adapts ST-based many-to-many

task allocation. We showcase the efficacy of the proposed algorithm through an

nodes influence the dynamics of the network and vice versa. We study a minimal
model of Kuramoto phase oscillators including a general adaptive learning rule
with three parameters (strength of adaptivity, adaptivity offset, adaptivity
shift), mimicking learning paradigms based on spike-time-dependent-plasticity
(STDP). Importantly, the strength of adaptivity allows to tune the system away
away from the limit of the classical Kuramoto model, corresponding to
stationary coupling strengths and no adaptation, and thus, to systematically
study the impact of adaptivity on the collective dynamics. We carry out a
detailed bifurcation analysis for the minimal model consisting of N = 2

behavior, drift or frequency-locking; but once the strength of adaptivity
exceeds a critical threshold non-trivial bifurcation structures unravel: A
symmetric adaptation rule results in multi-stability and bifurcation scenarios,
and an asymmetric adaptation rule generates even more intriguing and rich

displaying features of both librations and rotations simultaneously. Generally,
adaptation improves the synchronizability of the oscillators. Finally, we also

  Learning via Principal Angles Between Client Data Subspaces",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.DC math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Clustered federated learning (FL) has been shown to produce promising results
by grouping clients into clusters. This is especially effective in scenarios
where separate groups of clients have significant differences in the
distributions of their local data. Existing clustered FL algorithms are
essentially trying to group together clients with similar distributions so that
clients in the same cluster can leverage each other's data to better perform
federated learning. However, prior clustered FL algorithms attempt to learn
these distribution similarities indirectly during training, which can be quite
time consuming as many rounds of federated learning may be required until the
formation of clusters is stabilized. In this paper, we propose a new approach
to federated learning that directly aims to efficiently identify distribution
similarities among clients by analyzing the principal angles between the client
data subspaces. Each client applies a truncated singular value decomposition
(SVD) step on its local data in a single-shot manner to derive a small set of
principal vectors, which provides a signature that succinctly captures the main
characteristics of the underlying distribution. This small set of principal
vectors is provided to the server so that the server can directly identify
distribution similarities among the clients to form clusters. This is achieved
by comparing the similarities of the principal angles between the client data
subspaces spanned by those principal vectors. The approach provides a simple,
yet effective clustered FL framework that addresses a broad range of data
heterogeneity issues beyond simpler forms of Non-IIDness like label skews. Our
clustered FL approach also enables convergence guarantees for non-convex
objectives. Our code is available at https://github.com/MMorafah/PACFL.

this work presents the first comprehensive benchmarking study from three

datasets reveals the distinct impacts of data samples: datasets featuring
critical attributes (i.e. diverse poses, shapes, camera characteristics,
backbone features) are more effective. Strategical selection and combination of
high-quality datasets can yield a significant boost to the model performance.
2) Backbones. Experiments with 10 backbones, ranging from CNNs to transformers,
show the knowledge learnt from a proximity task is readily transferable to
human mesh recovery. 3) Training strategies. Proper augmentation techniques and

prescription to describe our simulated power spectra. In particular, we assess
the consistency of different bias measurements on large scales, and we estimate
up to which scales a linear bias is accurate in modelling the data, within the
statistical errors. We then test a second-order perturbative bias expansion for
the angular statistics, on a range of redshifts and scales previously
unexplored in this context, that is $0.4 \le \bar{z} \le 2$ up to scales
$\ell_\mathrm{max} \sim 1000$. We find that the angular power spectra at equal

number of bias parameters, that is using a two-parameter model comprising
linear bias and tidal bias. We show that this model performs significantly
better than a model without tidal bias but with quadratic bias as extra degree
of freedom, and that the latter is inaccurate at $\bar{z} \ge 0.7$. Finally, we
extract from our simulations the cross-correlation of halo number counts and

asymmetric in an applied perpendicular magnetic field and becomes hysteretic at
millikelvin temperatures. The hysteresis is due to long range magnetic order
arising from local Ta$^{4+}$ moments. However, the most striking features of
the data are the asymmetry of the transverse response and the large spontaneous
transverse resistance at zero field, which can be a significant fraction of the
longitudinal resistance and depends on crystal orientation. Both effects are
due to the presence of a dominant contribution to the transverse response that
is symmetric in perpendicular field, suggesting that its origin is topological
in nature. We argue that this contribution arises from Berry curvature dipoles
coupled with nonequilibrium conditions induced by the measuring current.

in the centers of galaxies is a crucial topic in modern astrophysics.
Observations have detected the SMBHs with mass $M$ of $10^{9}\, \rm M_\odot$ in
the high-redshift galaxies with $\rm z\sim7$. However, how SMBHs grew to such
huge masses within the first billion years after the big bang remains elusive.
One possible explanation is that SMBHs grow quickly through the frequent
mergers of galaxies, which provides sustainable gas to maintain rapid growth.
This study presents the hydrodynamics simulations of the SMBHs' growth with
their host galaxies using the GIZMO code. In contrast to previous simulations,
we have developed a giant molecular cloud (GMC) model by separating
molecular-gas particles from the atomic-gas particles and then evolving them
independently. During major mergers, we show that the more massive molecular
gas particles cloud bear stronger dynamical friction. Consequently, GMCs are
substantially accreted onto the galactic centers that grow SMBHs from $\sim
10^{7}$ $\rm M_\odot$ to $\sim 10^{9}\, \rm M_\odot$ within $300$ Myr,
explaining the rapid growth of SMBHs, and this accretion also triggers a
violent starburst at the galactic center. Furthermore, we examine the impact of
minor mergers on the bulge of a Milky-Way-like galaxy and find that the size
and mass of the bulge can increase from $0.92$ kpc to $1.9$ kpc and from
$4.7\times 10^{10}\, \rm M_\odot$ to $7\times 10^{10}\, \rm M_\odot$.

clients without collecting data in a centralized data-center, hence removing
data-privacy concerns. A major challenge for FL is data heterogeneity (where
each client's data distribution can differ) as it can lead to weight divergence
among local clients and slow global convergence. The current SOTA FL methods
designed for data heterogeneity typically impose regularization to limit the
impact of non-IID data and are stateful algorithms, i.e., they maintain local
statistics over time. While effective, these approaches can only be used for a
special case of FL involving only a small number of reliable clients. For the
more typical applications of FL where the number of clients is large (e.g.,
edge-device and mobile applications), these methods cannot be applied,
motivating the need for a stateless approach to heterogeneous FL which can be
used for any number of clients. We derive a first-order gradient regularization
to penalize inconsistent local updates due to local data heterogeneity.
Specifically, to mitigate weight divergence, we introduce a first-order
approximation of the global data distribution into local objectives, which
intuitively penalizes updates in the opposite direction of the global update.
The end result is a stateless FL algorithm that achieves 1) significantly
faster convergence (i.e., fewer communication rounds) and 2) higher overall
converged performance than SOTA methods under non-IID data distribution.
Importantly, our approach does not impose unrealistic limits on the client
size, enabling learning from a large number of clients as is typical in most FL
applications.

of a 6d supersymmetric gauge theory with a simple non-abelian gauge group,

finding that the large majority of binaries in these clusters (80%) can be
identified from Gaia DR3 and APOGEE criteria -- important for field star
applications. Our data agree well with independent activity proxies, indicating
that this technique recovers real starspot signals. In the Pleiades, filling
fractions saturate at a mean level of 0.248$\pm$0.005 for active stars with a
decline at slower rotation; we present fitting functions as a function of
Rossby number. In M67, we recover low mean filling fractions of 0.030$\pm$0.008

signals in inactive stars. Starspots also modify the derived spectroscopic
effective temperatures and convective overturn timescales. Effective
temperatures for active stars are offset from inactive ones by -109$\pm$11 K,
in agreement with the Pecaut & Mamajek empirical scale. Starspot filling
fractions at the level measured in active stars changes their inferred overturn
timescale, which biases the derived threshold for saturation. Finally, we
identify a population of stars statistically discrepant from mean
activity-Rossby relations and present evidence that these are genuine
departures from a Rossby scaling. Our technique is applicable to the full

completely characterise this task in both the single-shot and asymptotic

particular, we prove that the asymptotic error exponent of discriminating any
two quantum states $\rho$ and $\sigma$ is given by the Hilbert projective
metric $D_{\max}(\rho\|\sigma) + D_{\max}(\sigma \| \rho)$ in asymmetric
hypothesis testing, and by the Thompson metric $\max \{ D_{\max}(\rho\|\sigma),

two quantities with fundamental operational interpretations in quantum state
discrimination. Our findings extend to composite hypothesis testing, where we
show that the asymmetric error exponent with respect to any convex set of

Bayesian analysis simultaneously constrains the mass step and dust $R_V$

demonstrate how a simplistic analysis where individual $R_V$ values are first
estimated for each SN separately, and then the sample variance of these point

$\sigma_R^2$. This bias is exacerbated when neglecting residual intrinsic

shrinkage estimates of $\sigma_R$ are more accurate, with fully hierarchical

radio surveys remain uncertain, with explanations ranging from
starburst/AGN-driven shocks to supernova remnants (SNRs) in the low-density
ambient medium. Using well-calibrated radio light curve models, we assess the
possibility that ORCs are radio SNRs evolving in low ambient densities. Our
models imply that ORCs 1-5 and J0624-6948 (near the LMC) as SNRs must be within
200 kpc and 100 kpc from the Sun respectively, given their observed flux
densities and angular sizes. To be evolving in the circumgalactic medium of the
Milky Way, our models require ORCs 1-5 to be ejecta-dominated SNRs within 50
kpc, evolving in ambient densities of $(0.2-1.2) \times 10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$.
However, this is statistically unlikely because ORCs 1-5 would have ages $<640$
yrs, much smaller than their expected lifetimes of $\gtrsim$10$^5$ yrs at these
densities, and because the low SN rate and steep profile of the stellar halo
imply a negligible number of ORC-like SNRs within 50 kpc. The circumgalactic
medium SNR scenario for J0624-6948 is more likely (though still low
probability) compared to ORCs 1-5, as our models allow J0624-6948 to be
$\lesssim$3000 yrs. On the other hand, the interpretation of J0624-6948 as a
Sedov-Taylor SNR at 50 kpc (LMC) distance is possible for a wide range of
ambient densities ($6 \times 10^{-4} - 0.5$ cm$^{-3}$) and ages

employing $n$-particle Green's function to classify interacting systems.
Fundamentally, we define a class of interacting reference states that

band representations acquire an extra gauge invariant phase compared to the

simulating strongly correlated systems on near-term quantum hardware, but they

TETRIS-ADAPT-VQE, which iteratively builds up variational ans\""atze a few
operators at a time in a way dictated by the problem being simulated. This
algorithm is a modified version of the ADAPT-VQE algorithm in which the
one-operator-at-a-time rule is lifted to allow for the addition of multiple
operators with disjoint supports in each iteration. TETRIS-ADAPT-VQE results in
denser but significantly shallower circuits, without increasing the number of
CNOT gates or variational parameters. Its advantage over the original algorithm
in terms of circuit depths increases with the system size. Moreover, the
expensive step of measuring the energy gradient with respect to each candidate
unitary at each iteration is performed only a fraction of the time compared to
ADAPT-VQE. These improvements bring us closer to the goal of demonstrating a
practical quantum advantage on quantum hardware.

different from the ones we observe in the Standard Model (SM). Moreover, in the
freeze-in mechanism, often employed by the dark sector models, it is also
required that the dark sector cannot be populated during the reheating process
like the SM. This is the so called asymmetric reheating. Such disparities in
sizes and scales often call for dynamical explanations. In this paper, we
explore a scenario in which slow evolving conformal field theories (CFTs) offer
such an explanation. Building on the recent work on conformal freeze-in (COFI),
we focus on a coupling between the Standard Model Hypercharge gauge boson and
an anti-symmetric tensor operator in the dark CFT. We present a scenario which
dynamically realizes the asymmetric reheating and COFI production. With a
detailed study of dark matter production, and taking into account limits on the
dark matter (DM) self-interaction, warm DM bound, and constraints from the
stellar evolution, we demonstrate that the correct relic abundance can be
obtained with reasonable choices of parameters. The model predicts the
existence of a dark photon as an emergent composite particle, with a small
kinetic mixing also determined by the CFT dynamics, which correlates it with
the generation of the mass scale of the dark sector. At the same time, COFI
production of dark matter is very different from those freeze-in mediated by
the dark photon. This is an example of the physics in which a realistic dark
sector model can often be much richer and with unexpected features.

perturbative parameter regulating the deviation from the general-relativistic
potential, and in powers of $M/r$. We compute the quasinormal modes of the
modified potential up to quadratic order in the perturbative parameter. Then we
use Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methods to recover the coefficients in the
$M/r$ expansion in an ``optimistic'' scenario where we vary them one at a time,
and in a ``pessimistic'' scenario where we vary them all simultaneously. In
both cases, we find that the bounds on the individual parameters are not
robust. Because quasinormal mode frequencies are related to the behavior of the
perturbation potential near the light ring, we propose a different strategy.
Inspired by Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) theory, we demonstrate that the
value of the potential and of its second derivative at the light ring can be
robustly constrained. These constraints allow for a more direct comparison

manipulate the properties of quantum materials very quickly, or even induce new
and potentially useful phases that are absent in equilibrium. For instance,
ultrafast control of magnetic dynamics is crucial for a number of proposed
spintronic devices and can also shed light on the possible dynamics of
correlated phases out of equilibrium. Inspired by recent experiments on
spin-orbital ferromagnet YTiO$_3$ we consider the nonequilibrium dynamics of
Heisenberg ferromagnetic insulator with low-lying orbital excitations. We model
the dynamics of the magnon excitations in this system following an optical
pulse which resonantly excites infrared-active phonon modes. As the phonons
ring down they can dynamically couple the orbitals with the low-lying magnons,
leading to a dramatically modified effective bath for the magnons. We show this
transient coupling can lead to a dynamical acceleration of the magnetization
dynamics, which is otherwise bottlenecked by small anisotropy. Exploring the
parameter space more we find that the magnon dynamics can also even completely
reverse, leading to a negative relaxation rate when the pump is blue-detuned
with respect to the orbital bath resonance. We therefore show that by using
specially targeted optical pulses, one can exert a much greater degree of
control over the magnetization dynamics, allowing one to optically steer
magnetic order in this system. We conclude by discussing interesting parallels
between the magnetization dynamics we find here and recent experiments on
photo-induced superconductivity, where it is similarly observed that depending
on the initial pump frequency, an apparent metastable superconducting phase
emerges.

an anisotropic ($d$-wave) attractive potential. We solve the two-body

measurements confirm the sharpness of the charge order transition in the same

galactic nuclei (AGN). It has been argued that extreme starbursts can power
extreme outflows, without the need to invoke AGN feedback. However,
contributions from past and/or hidden AGN activity cannot be ruled out. Here,
we constrain the potential role of the central black hole in driving powerful
outflows in starburst galaxies (with no sign of ongoing AGN activity). We
examine whether the galactic outflows can be explained by AGN luminosity
evolution in the framework of our AGN `radiative dusty feedback' scenario. We
show that the outflow energetics of starburst galaxies in the local Universe
can be quantitatively reproduced by power-law and exponential luminosity
decays, coupled with radiation trapping. Likewise, a combination of heavy
obscuration and mild luminosity decay may account for the energetics of
galactic outflows observed in dusty star-forming galaxies in the early
Universe. We discuss different physical arguments for SB vs. AGN
outflow-driving, and conclude that the latter can have a major impact on the
evolution of galaxies.

molecular clouds. Depositing (part of) their energy through ionisation, cosmic
rays play an essential role in determining the physical and chemical evolution
of star-forming regions. To a first approximation their effect can be
quantified by the cosmic-ray induced ionization rate. Interestingly,
theoretical estimates of the ionization rate assuming the cosmic-ray spectra
observed in the local interstellar medium result in an ionization rate that is
one to two orders of magnitude below the values inferred from observations.
However, due to the discrete nature of sources, the local spectra of MeV cosmic
rays are in general not representative for the spectra elsewhere in the Galaxy.
Such stochasticity effects have the potential of reconciling modelled
ionization rates with measured ones. Here, we model the distribution of
low-energy cosmic-ray spectra expected from a statistical population of
supernova remnants in the Milky Way. The corresponding distribution for the
ionization rate is derived and confronted with data. We find that the
stochastic uncertainty helps with explaining the surprisingly high ionization
rates observed in many molecular clouds.

these approaches are effective in the short-term (i.e., the first few
human-robot interactions), here we explore long-term influence (i.e., repeated
interactions between the same human and robot). Our central insight is that
humans are dynamic: people adapt to robots, and behaviors which are influential
now may fall short once the human learns to anticipate the robot's actions.
With this insight, we experimentally demonstrate that a prevalent
game-theoretic formalism for generating influential robot behaviors becomes
less effective over repeated interactions. Next, we propose three modifications
to Stackelberg games that make the robot's policy both influential and
unpredictable. We finally test these modifications across simulations and user

The 98{\deg}-obliquity of Uranus is commonly attributed to giant
impacts that occurred at the end of the planetary formation. This picture,
however, is not devoid of weaknesses.
  Aims. On a billion-year timescale, the tidal migration of the satellites of
Jupiter and Saturn has been shown to strongly affect their spin-axis dynamics.
We aim to revisit the scenario of tilting Uranus in light of this mechanism.
  Methods. We analyse the precession spectrum of Uranus and identify the
candidate secular spin-orbit resonances that could be responsible for the
tilting. We determine the properties of the hypothetical ancient satellite
required for a capture and explore the dynamics numerically.
  Results. If it migrates over 10 Uranus' radii, a single satellite with
minimum mass 4e-4 Uranus' mass is able to tilt Uranus from a small obliquity
and make it converge towards 90{\deg}. In order to achieve the tilting in less
than the age of the Solar System, the mean drift rate of the satellite must be
comparable to the Moon's current orbital expansion. Under these conditions,
simulations show that Uranus is readily tilted over 80{\deg}. Beyond this
point, the satellite is strongly destabilised and triggers a phase of chaotic
motion for the planet's spin axis. The chaotic phase ends when the satellite
collides into the planet, ultimately freezing the planet's obliquity in either
a prograde, or plainly retrograde state (as Uranus today). Spin states
resembling that of Uranus can be obtained with probabilities as large as 80%,
but a bigger satellite is favoured, with mass 1.7e-3 Uranus' mass or more. Yet,
a smaller ancient satellite is not categorically ruled out, and there is room
for improving this basic scenario in future studies. Interactions among several
pre-existing satellites is a promising possibility.

rates. This study investigates the use of BERTScore, an evaluation metric for
text generation, to provide a more informative measure of ASR model quality and
usefulness. Both BERTScore and WER were compared to prediction errors manually
annotated by Speech Language Pathologists for error type and assessment.
BERTScore was found to be more correlated with human assessment of error type
and assessment. BERTScore was specifically more robust to orthographic changes
(contraction and normalization errors) where meaning was preserved.
Furthermore, BERTScore was a better fit of error assessment than WER, as
measured using an ordinal logistic regression and the Akaike's Information
Criterion (AIC). Overall, our findings suggest that BERTScore can complement
WER when assessing ASR model performance from a practical perspective,
especially for accessibility applications where models are useful even at lower

  regime of dynamical tides","Accepted for publication in A&A","A&A 667, A127 (2022)","10.1051/0004-6361/202244280",,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hot Jupiters on extremely short-period orbits are expected to be unstable to
tidal dissipation and spiral toward their host stars. That is because they
transfer the angular momentum of the orbital motion through tidal dissipation
into the stellar interior. Although the magnitude of this phenomenon is related
to the physical properties of a specific star-planet system, statistical
studies show that tidal dissipation might shape the architecture of hot Jupiter
systems during the stellar lifetime on the main sequence. The efficiency of
tidal dissipation remains poorly constrained in star-planet systems. Stellar
interior models show that the dissipation of dynamical tides in radiation zones
could be the dominant mechanism driving planetary orbital decay. These
theoretical predictions can be verified with the transit timing method. We
acquired new precise transit mid-times for five planets. They were previously
identified as the best candidates for which orbital decay might be detected.
Analysis of the timing data allowed us to place tighter constraints on the
orbital decay rate. No statistically significant changes in their orbital
periods were detected for all five hot Jupiters in systems HAT-P-23, KELT-1,
KELT-16, WASP-18, and WASP-103. For planets HAT-P-23 b, WASP-18 b, and WASP-103
b, observations show that the mechanism of the dynamical tides dissipation
probably does not operate in their host stars, preventing them from rapid
orbital decay. This finding aligns with the models of stellar interiors of
F-type stars, in which dynamical tides are not fully damped due to convective
cores. For KELT-16 b, the span of transit timing data was not long enough to
verify the theoretical predictions. KELT-1 b was identified as a potential
laboratory for studying the dissipative tidal interactions of inertial waves in
a convective layer.

walks with a heterogeneous ensemble and those with strong memory where the
transition probability depends on the entire history of steps. We find the
ensemble averaged solution of the fractional master equation through
subordination involving the fractional Poisson process counting the number of
steps at a given time and the underlying discrete random walk with
self-reinforcement. We also find the exact solution for the variance which
exhibits superdiffusion even as the fractional exponent tends to 1.

weak free-carrier component with a Drude plasma frequency of $\simeq 1100$
cm$^{-1}$ and a scattering rate of $1/\tau_D\simeq 700$ cm$^{-1}$, with the
onset of interband absorptions above $\simeq 2000$ cm$^{-1}$. Two
infrared-active $E_u$ modes are observed at $\simeq\,$89 and 239 cm$^{-1}$. As
the temperature is reduced the scattering rate decreases and the low-frequency
conductivity increases slightly; however, below $\simeq 50$ K the conductivity
decreases until at the resistivity maximum at $\simeq 18$ K (just below
$2T_{\rm N}$) the spectral weight associated with free carriers is transferred
to a localized excitation at $\simeq 500$ cm$^{-1}$. Below $T_{\rm N}$,
metallic behavior is recovered. Interestingly, the $E_u$ modes are largely
unaffected by these changes, with only the position of the high-frequency mode
showing any signs of anomalous behavior. While several scenarios are
considered, the prevailing view is that the resistivity maximum and subsequent
carrier localization is due to the formation of ferromagnetic domains below
$\simeq 2T_{\rm N}$ that result in spin-polarized clusters due to spin-carrier
coupling [1].

stellar evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA).
Using Radial Stellar Pulsations (RSP), a recently added functionality of MESA,
we obtained theoretical instability strip (IS) edges and linear periods for the
radial fundamental mode. Period-age, period-age-temperature, period-luminosity,
and period-luminosity-temperature relationships were derived for three rotation
rates and metallicities, showing a dependence on crossing number, position in
the IS, rotation, and metallicity. We calculated period change rates (PCRs)
based on the linear periods from RSP. We compared our models with literature
results using the Geneva code, and found large differences, as expected due to
the different implementations of rotation between codes. In addition, we
compared our theoretical PCRs with those measured in our recent work for Large
Magellanic Cloud Cepheids. We found good overall agreement, even though our
models do not reach the short-period regime exhibited by the empirical data.
Implementations of physical processes not yet included in our models, such as
pulsation-driven mass loss, an improved treatment of convection that may lead
to a better description of the instability strip edges, as well as
consideration of a wider initial mass range, could all help improve the
agreement with the observed PCRs.

linear programming and quadratically-constrained quadratic programming, while
also yielding efficient solvers, both in theory and in practice. However, there
exist known impossibility results for approximating the optimal solution when
constraints for covering SDPs arrive in an online fashion. In this paper, we
study online covering linear and semidefinite programs in which the algorithm
is augmented with advice from a possibly erroneous predictor. We show that if
the predictor is accurate, we can efficiently bypass these impossibility
results and achieve a constant-factor approximation to the optimal solution,
i.e., consistency. On the other hand, if the predictor is inaccurate, under
some technical conditions, we achieve results that match both the classical
optimal upper bounds and the tight lower bounds up to constant factors, i.e.,
robustness.
  More broadly, we introduce a framework that extends both (1) the online set
cover problem augmented with machine-learning predictors, studied by Bamas,
Maggiori, and Svensson (NeurIPS 2020), and (2) the online covering SDP problem,
initiated by Elad, Kale, and Naor (ICALP 2016). Specifically, we obtain general
online learning-augmented algorithms for covering linear programs with
fractional advice and constraints, and initiate the study of learning-augmented
algorithms for covering SDP problems.
  Our techniques are based on the primal-dual framework of Buchbinder and Naor

handle constraints where the variables lie in a bounded region, i.e., box
constraints.

number of steps VQA required until the iterates satisfy a surrogate measure of
optimality. We argue that although VQA procedures incorporate algorithms that
can, in the idealized case, be modeled as classic procedures in the
optimization literature, the particular nature of noise in near-term devices
invalidates the claim of applicability of off-the-shelf analyses of these
algorithms. Specifically, the form of the noise makes the evaluations of the
objective function via circuits biased, necessitating the perspective of
convergence analysis of variants of these classical optimization procedures,
wherein the evaluations exhibit systematic bias. We apply our reasoning to the
most often used procedures, including SPSA the parameter shift rule, which can
be seen as zeroth-order, or derivative-free, optimization algorithms with
biased function evaluations. We show that the asymptotic rate of convergence is
unaffected by the bias, but the level of bias contributes unfavorably to both
the constant therein, and the asymptotic distance to stationarity.

  Intelligent Surface",,,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Communication with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in current terrestrial
networks suffers from poor signal strength due to the down-tilt of the access
points (APs) that are optimized to serve ground users ends (GUEs). To solve
this, one could tilt the AP antenna upwards or allocate more power to serve the
UAV. However, this negatively affects GUE downlink (DL) rates. In this paper,
we propose to solve this challenge using a reconfigurable intelligent surface
(RIS) to enhance the UAV communication while preserving the 3GPP- prescribed
downwards antenna tilt and potentially improving the DL performance of the GUE.
We show that under conjugate beamforming (CB) precoding and proper power split
between GUEs and the UAV at the APs, an RIS with phase-shifts configured to
reflect radio signals towards the UAV can significantly improve the UAV DL
throughput while simultaneously benefiting the GUEs. The presented numerical
results show that the RIS- aided system can serve a UAV with a required data
rate while improving the GUEs DL performance relative to that in a CF- MIMO
system without a UAV and an RIS. We support this conclusion through simulations
under a varying numbers of RIS reflecting elements, UAV heights, and power
split factor.

groups upon different questions about geometric and functional aspects of the
construction detail as well as surveys and interviews of participating
lecturers, students and laypersons towards their experience using the VR tool.
The quantitative analysis of the test results prove that for participants with
little pre-existing knowledge (such as novice students), a significantly better
learning score for the test group is detected. Moreover, both groups rated the
VR experience as an enjoyable and engaging way of learning. Analysis of survey
results towards the VR experience reveals, that students, lecturers and

the construction detail. During the post-experiment qualitative evaluation in
the form of interviews, the panel expressed an improved understanding,
increased enthusiasm for the topic, and greater desire for other topics to be
presented using VR tools. The expressed better understanding of design concepts
after the VR experience by the students is statistically significant on average
in the exam results. The results support our core assumption, that the

fundamental role of Ti- and V-bearing species in the planetary energy balance.
Moreover, we assessed and confirm the presence of OH, Fe I, and Si I from

unambiguously proves the presence of an inverted temperature profile in the
planetary atmosphere. By performing retrievals on the emission lines of all the
detected species, we determined a relatively weak atmospheric thermal inversion
extending from approximately 3400 K to 4000 K. We infer a supersolar
metallicity close to 1.5 dex in the planetary atmosphere, and find that its
emission signature undergoes significant line broadening with a Gaussian FWHM
of about 4.5 km/s. Also, we find that the atmospheric temperature profile
retrieved at orbital phases far from the secondary eclipse is about 300 K to
700 K cooler than that measured close to the secondary eclipse, which is
consistent with different day- and nightside temperatures. Moreover, retrievals
performed on the emission lines of the individual chemical species lead to
consistent results, which gives additional confidence to our retrieval method.
Increasing the number of species included in the retrieval and expanding the
set of retrieved atmospheric parameters will further advance our understanding

quantum systems undergoing Rabi oscillations. The systems interact with an
environment designed to perform continuous measurements of an observable,
driving the systems stochastically towards one of the eigenstates of the
corresponding operator. The system-environment coupling constant represents the
strength of the measurement. Stochastic quantum trajectories are generated by
unravelling a Markovian Lindblad master equation using the quantum state
diffusion formalism. This is regarded as a better representation of system
behaviour than consideration of the averaged evolution since the latter can
mask the effect of measurement. Complete positivity is maintained and thus the
trajectories can be considered as physically meaningful. Increasing the
measurement strength leads to greater dwell by the system in the vicinity of
the eigenstates of the measured observable and lengthens the time taken by the
system to return to that eigenstate, thus demonstrating the Quantum Zeno
Effect. For very strong measurement, the Rabi oscillations develop into
randomly occurring near-instantaneous jumps between eigenstates. The stochastic
measurement dynamics compete with the intrinsic, deterministic quantum dynamics
of the system, each attempting to drive the system in the Hilbert space in
different ways. As such, the trajectories followed by the quantum system are
heavily dependent on the measurement strength which other than slowing down and
adding noise to the Rabi oscillations, changes the paths taken in spin phase
space from a circular precession into elaborate figures-of-eight.

statistics, which requires recurrent communication between neurons.
Mechanistically, such recurrent communication is often indirect and mediated by
local interneurons. In this work, we explore the computational benefits of
mediating recurrent communication via interneurons compared with direct
recurrent connections. To this end, we consider two mathematically tractable
recurrent neural networks that statistically whiten their inputs -- one with
direct recurrent connections and the other with interneurons that mediate
recurrent communication. By analyzing the corresponding continuous synaptic
dynamics and numerically simulating the networks, we show that the network with
interneurons is more robust to initialization than the network with direct
recurrent connections in the sense that the convergence time for the synaptic
dynamics in the network with interneurons (resp. direct recurrent connections)
scales logarithmically (resp. linearly) with the spectrum of their
initialization. Our results suggest that interneurons are computationally
useful for rapid adaptation to changing input statistics. Interestingly, the
network with interneurons is an overparameterized solution of the whitening
objective for the network with direct recurrent connections, so our results can
be viewed as a recurrent neural network analogue of the implicit acceleration
phenomenon observed in overparameterized feedforward linear networks.

(~6x standard mean ocean water, SMOW) is higher than that of known sources,
requiring planetary enrichment. A recent measurement by NASA's Mars Science
Laboratory rover Curiosity of >3 Gyr clays yields a D/H ratio ~3x SMOW,
demonstrating that most enrichment occurs early in Mars's history. As on Venus,
Mars's D/H enrichment is thought to reflect preferential loss to space of 1H
(protium) relative to 2H (deuterium), but the global environmental context of
large and early hydrogen losses remain to be determined. Here, we apply a
recent model of primordial atmosphere evolution to Mars, link the magma ocean
of the accretion epoch with a subsequent water-ocean epoch, and calculate the
behavior of deuterium for comparison with the observed record. We find that a
~2-3x hydrospheric deuterium-enrichment is produced if the Martian magma ocean
is chemically reducing at last equilibration with the primordial atmosphere,
making H2-CO the initially dominant species, with minor abundances of H2O-CO2.
Reducing gases - in particular H2 - can cause greenhouse warming and prevent a
water ocean from freezing immediately after the magma ocean epoch. Moreover,
the pressure-temperature conditions are high enough to produce ocean-atmosphere
H2O-H2 isotopic equilibrium such that surface H2O strongly concentrates
deuterium relative to H2, which preferentially takes up protium and escapes
from the primordial atmosphere. The proposed scenario of primordial H2-rich
outgassing and escape suggests significant durations (>Myr) of chemical
conditions on the Martian surface conducive to prebiotic chemistry immediately
following Martian accretion.

cope with these challenges in their own way due to their architectural

previous study in the literature that employs all these metrics while taking

degrades when the input workload gets larger. Scaling the environment by
additional clusters significantly improves the performance of Spark. However,
similar enhancement is not observed in Hadoop. Machine learning utility of

We demonstrate UPIR via a prototype implementation in the ROSE compiler for

we propose a deep learning approach based on recently introduced complex-valued

which can then be used to form enhanced images using standard delay-and-sum
beamforming. Complex-valued convolutional networks were selected as they can
apply time delays through multiplication with in-phase quadrature input data.
Predicting the aberration function rather than corrected images also confers
enhanced explainability to the network. In addition, 3D spatiotemporal
convolutions were used for the network to leverage entire microbubble tracks.
For training and validation, we used an anatomically and hemodynamically
realistic mouse brain microvascular network model to simulate the flow of
microbubbles in presence of aberration. We then confirmed the capability of our
network to generalize to transcranial in vivo data in the mouse brain (n=3).
Qualitatively, vascular reconstructions using a pixel-wise predicted aberration
function included additional and sharper vessels. The spatial resolution was
evaluated by using the Fourier ring correlation (FRC). After correction, we
measured a resolution of 15.6 {\mu}m in vivo, representing an improvement of up

Recently the applicability of the model has been expanded through the

we explore a candidate spin-1 honeycomb system, KNiAsO$_4$ , which meets many
of the proposed criteria to generate such an interaction. Bulk measurements
reveal an antiferromagnetic transition at $\sim$ 19 K which is generally robust
to applied magnetic fields. Neutron diffraction measurements show magnetic
order with a $\textbf{k}=(\frac{3}{2},0,0)$ ordering vector which results in
the well-known ``zig-zag"" magnetic structure thought to be adjacent to the
spin-liquid ground state. Field dependent diffraction shows that while the
structure is robust, the field can tune the direction of the ordered moment.
Inelastic neutron scattering experiments show a well defined gapped spin-wave
spectrum with no evidence of the continuum expected for fractionalized
excitations. Modeling of the spin waves shows that the extended Kitaev
spin-Hamiltonians is generally necessary to model the spectra and reproduce the
observed magnetic order. First principles calculations suggest that the
substitution of Pd on the Ni sublattice may strengthen the Kitaev interactions
while simultaneously weakening the exchange interactions thus pushing
KNiAsO$_4$ closer to the spin-liquid ground state.

emergence of the ferro-axial moment depending on the helicity. By introducing a
multipole description, we show that the ferro-axial nature appears when two
types of odd-parity magnetic multipoles become active under the vortex spin
texture: One is the magnetic monopole and the other is the magnetic toroidal
dipole. We present all the magnetic point groups to possess the ferro-axial

is microscopically characterized by both the cluster-scale and atomic-scale
axial-vector quantities: The former is described by the vortex of the local
electric dipole and the latter is represented by the outer product of the local
orbital and spin angular momenta. Moreover, we find that the atomic-spin orbit

latest success of deep neural networks in a variety of domains, understanding
the decision-making process of such complex models still remains a challenging
task for domain experts. Especially in the financial domain, merely pointing to
an anomaly composed of often hundreds of mixed type columns, has limited value
for experts. Hence, in this paper, we propose a framework for explaining
anomalies using denoising autoencoders designed for mixed type tabular data. We
specifically focus our technique on anomalies that are erroneous observations.
This is achieved by localizing individual sample columns (cells) with potential
errors and assigning corresponding confidence scores. In addition, the model
provides the expected cell value estimates to fix the errors. We evaluate our
approach based on three standard public tabular datasets (Credit Default,
Adult, IEEE Fraud) and one proprietary dataset (Holdings). We find that
denoising autoencoders applied to this task already outperform other approaches
in the cell error detection rates as well as in the expected value rates.
Additionally, we analyze how a specialized loss designed for cell error
detection can further improve these metrics. Our framework is designed for a
domain expert to understand abnormal characteristics of an anomaly, as well as
to improve in-house data quality management processes.

smells are sociotechnical anti-patterns and one source of social debt that
impact software teams, development processes, outcomes, and organizations.
Objective: To provide an overview of community smells based on published
literature, and describe future research. Method: We conducted a systematic
literature review (SLR) to identify properties, understand origins and
evolution, and describe the emergence of community smells. This SLR explains
the impact of community smells on teamwork and team performance. Results: We
include 25 studies. Social debt describes the impacts of poor socio-technical
decisions on work environments, people, software products, and society. For
each of the 30 identified community smells, we provide a description,
management approaches, organizational strategies, and mitigation effectiveness.
We identify five groups of management approaches: organizational strategies,
frameworks, models, tools, and guidelines. We describe 11 properties of
community smells. We develop the Community Smell Stages Framework to concisely
describe the origin and evolution of community smells. We describe the causes
and effects for each community smell. We identify and describe 8 types of
causes and 11 types of effects for community smells. Finally, we provide 8
Sankey diagrams that offer insights into threats the community smells pose to
teamwork factors and team performance. Conclusion: Community smells explain the
influence work conditions have on software developers. The literature is scarce
and focuses on a small number of community smells. Thus, community smells still
need more research. This review organizes the state of the art about community

is an important subject in both computer music and psychoacoustics. Early
studies of ""equal-loudness contour"" can trace back to the 1920s and the
measured loudness with respect to intensity and frequency has been revised many
times since then. However, most studies merely focus on synthesized sound, and
the induced theories on natural tones with complex timbre have rarely been
justified. To this end, we investigate both theory and applications of
natural-tone loudness perception in this paper via modeling piano tone. The
theory part contains: 1) an accurate measurement of piano-tone equal-loudness
contour of pitches, and 2) a machine-learning model capable of inferring
loudness purely based on spectral features trained on human subject
measurements. As for the application, we apply our theory to piano control
transfer, in which we adjust the MIDI velocities on two different player pianos
(in different acoustic environments) to achieve the same perceptual effect.
Experiments show that both our theoretical loudness modeling and the
corresponding performance control transfer algorithm significantly outperform
their baselines.

factored representation of the matrix variable, where the global optimal
solutions overfit and do not correspond to the underlying ground-truth. We then
solve the associated nonconvex problem using gradient descent with small random

restricted isometry property (RIP) with its rank parameter scaling with the
rank of ground-truth matrix rather than scaling with the overspecified matrix
variable, gradient descent iterations are on a particular trajectory towards
the ground-truth matrix and achieve nearly information-theoretically optimal
recovery when stop appropriately. We then propose an efficient early stopping

situations where vertical fluxes are important, studying the vertical transport
and displacement of material requires analysis over a finite interval of time.
One such example is the subduction of fluid from the mixed layer into the
pycnocline, which is known to occur near density fronts. Divergence has been
used to estimate vertical velocities indicating that surface measurements,
where observational data is most widely available, can be used to locate these
vertical transport conduits. We evaluate the correlation between surface
signatures derived from Eulerian (horizontal divergence, density gradient, and
vertical velocity) and Lagrangian (dilation rate and finite time Lyapunov
exponent) metrics and vertical displacement conduits. Two submesoscale
resolving models of density fronts and a data-assimilative model of the western
Mediterranean were analyzed. The Lagrangian surface signatures locate
significantly more of the strongest displacement features and the difference in
the expected displacements relative to Eulerian ones increases with the length
of the time interval considered. Ensemble analysis of forecasts from the
Mediterranean model demonstrates that the Lagrangian surface signatures can be
used to identify regions of strongest downward vertical displacement even

discrepancy between each encoding element and information of the element
recovered from all other encoding elements. Disentanglement is promoted
efficiently by framing this as a minmax game between the AE and an ensemble of

an observation of all other elements. We quantitatively compare our approach

control (VVC) on a distribution system. New smart inverters offer Var support
capability but for their effective use they need to be coordinated with
existing Volt/Var schemes. A new VVC scheme is proposed to facilitate such
coordination. The proposed scheme decomposes the problem into two levels. The
first level uses Load Tap Changer (LTC) and Voltage Regulators (VRs) and
coordinates their control with smart inverters to adjust the voltage level on
the circuit to keep the voltages along the circuit within the desired range.
The second level determines Var support needed from smart inverters to minimize
the overall power loss in the circuit. The results of the supervisory control
are sent to the devices which have their local controllers. To avoid frequent
dispatch, smart inverters are supervised by shifting their Volt/Var
characteristics as needed. This allows for the smart inverters to operate close
to their optimal control while meeting the limited communication requirements
on a distribution system. A case study using the IEEE 34 bus system shows the
effectiveness of this supervisory control scheme compared to traditional
volt/var schemes.

the dynamics of flexible fibers settling in a viscous fluid embedded with

observe nontrivial trapping conformations on sharp obstacles that result from a
subtle balance between elasticity, gravity and friction. In the gliding case, a
flexible fiber reorients and drifts sideways after sliding along the obstacle.
The subsequent lateral displacement is large compared to the fiber length and
strongly depends on its mechanical and geometrical properties. We show how
these effects can be leveraged to propose a new strategy to sort particles

between antisite defects and the FM Mn layer in MBT, establishing common

GPH) for approximating the solution of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations.
As in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), GPH is a Lagrangian particle-based
approach involving the tracking of a finite number of particles transported by
the flow. However, these particles do not represent mollified particles of
matter but carry discrete/partial information about the continuous flow.
Closure is achieved by placing a divergence-free GP prior $\xi$ on the velocity
field and conditioning on vorticity at particle locations. Known physics (e.g.,
the Richardson cascade and velocity-increments power laws) is incorporated into
the GP prior through physics-informed additive kernels. This approach allows us
to coarse-grain turbulence in a statistical manner rather than a deterministic
one. By enforcing incompressibility and fluid/structure boundary conditions
through the selection of the kernel, GPH requires much fewer particles than
SPH. Since GPH has a natural probabilistic interpretation, numerical results
come with uncertainty estimates enabling their incorporation into a UQ pipeline
and the adding/removing of particles (quantas of information) in an adapted
manner. The proposed approach is amenable to analysis, it inherits the
complexity of state-of-the-art solvers for dense kernel matrices, and it leads
to a natural definition of turbulence as information loss. Numerical
experiments support the importance of selecting physics-informed kernels and
illustrate the major impact of such kernels on accuracy and stability. Since
the proposed approach has a Bayesian interpretation, it naturally enables data
assimilation and making predictions and estimations based on mixing simulation
data with experimental data.

flow unsteadiness over an unswept laminar-flow wing section, appearing in the
following order of increasing frequency: (a) a low-frequency transonic buffet
mode, (b) an intermediate-frequency separation bubble mode, and (c)
high-frequency wake modes associated with vortex shedding. Simulations are run
over a range of Reynolds and Mach numbers to connect the lower frequency modes
from moderate to high Reynolds numbers and from pre-buffet to established
buffet conditions. The intermediate frequency mode is found to be more
sensitive to Reynolds-number effects compared to those of Mach number, which is
the opposite trend to that observed for transonic buffet. Spectral proper
orthogonal decomposition is used to extract the spatial structure of the modes.
The buffet mode involves coherent oscillations of the suction-side shock
structure, consistent with previous studies including global mode analysis. The
laminar separation-bubble mode at intermediate frequency is fundamentally
different, with a phase relationship between separation and reattachment that
does not correspond to a simple `breathing' mode and is not at the same
Strouhal number observed for shock-induced separation bubbles. Instead, a
Strouhal number based on separation bubble length and reverse flow magnitude is
found to be independent of Reynolds number within the range of cases studied.

by using a Bayesian filter combined with a long-term data association

filtering based on object detection that correctly identify features inside the

could cause lost tracks. Furthermore, a new dataset was developed with RGB-D

We first derive the orbital parameters and the stellar radii by solving the
light and radial velocity curves. Then the luminosity contributions in
different phases can be calculated. The synthesised double-lined spectra model
is constructed by superposing theoretical single-star spectra according to the
luminosity contributions. Finally, we derive the atmospheric parameters of each

results for detached eclipsing binary systems observed in different orbital

placing the source as the 5th accreting neutron star (NS) exhibiting
double/triple-peaked type-I X-ray bursts; the other bursts showed photospheric
radius expansion (PRE). The properties of double-peaked non-PRE burst indicate
that it could be related to a stalled burning front. For the five bright PRE
bursts, apart from the emission from the neutron star (NS) surface, we find the
residuals both in the soft ($<$3 keV) and hard ($>$10 keV) X-ray band.
Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the excess can be attributed to an
enhanced pre-burst/persistent emission or the Comptonization of the burst
emission by the corona/boundary-layer. We find, the burst emission shows a rise
until the photosphere touches down to the NS surface rather than the
theoretical predicted constant Eddington luminosity.
  The shortage of the burst emission in the early rising phase is beyond the
occlusion by the disk. We speculate that the findings above correspond to that
the obscured part (not only the lower part) of the NS surface is exposed to the
line of sight due to the evaporation of the obscured material by the burst
emission, or the burst emission is anisotropic ($\xi>1$) in the burst early
phase. In addition, based on the average flux of PRE bursts at their touch-down

new paradigm to train machine learning (ML) models in distributed systems,

direct-to-reverberant energy ratio (DRR) and applied as a new constraint to
eliminate the nonlinear noise from motion reports. A particle filter is applied
to estimate the critical distance, which is key for associating the source's
distance with the DRR. A keyframe method is used to eliminate the deviation of
the source position estimation toward the robot. The proposed DoA-DRR acoustic
SLAM (D-D SLAM) is designed for three-dimensional motion and is suitable for
most robots. The method is the first acoustic SLAM algorithm that has been
validated on a real-world indoor scene dataset that contains only acoustic data
and IMU measurements. Compared with previous methods, D-D SLAM has acceptable
performance in locating the robot and building a source map from a real-world
indoor dataset. The average location accuracy is 0.48 m, while the source
position error converges to less than 0.25 m within 2.8 s. These results prove
the effectiveness of D-D SLAM in real-world indoor scenes, which may be
especially useful in search and rescue missions after disasters where the
environment is foggy, i.e., unsuitable for light or laser irradiation.

measurement. Quantum criticality has been presented as a novel and efficient
resource. Generally, protocols of criticality-based quantum metrology often
work without decoherence. In this paper, we address the issue whether the
divergent feature of the inverted variance is indeed realizable in the presence
of noise when approaching the QPT. Taking the quantum Rabi model (QRM) as an
example, we obtain the analytical result for the inverted variance. We show
that the inverted variance may be convergent in time due to the noise. When
approaching the critical point, the maximum inverted variance demonstrates a
power-law increase with the exponent -1.2, of which the absolute value is
smaller than that for the noise-free case, i.e., 2. We also observe a power-law
dependence of the maximum inverted variance on the relaxation rate and the
temperature. Since the precision of the metrology is very sensitive to the
noise, as a remedy, we propose performing the squeezing operation on the
initial state to improve the precision under decoherence. In addition, we also
investigate the criticality-based metrology under the influence of the
two-photon relaxation. Contrary to the single-photon relaxation, the quantum
dynamics of the inverted variance shows a completely-different behavior. It
does not oscillate with the same frequency with respect to the re-scaled time
for different dimensionless coupling strengths. Strikingly, although the
maximum inverted variance still manifests a power-law dependence on the energy
gap, the exponent is positive and depends on the dimensionless coupling
strength. This observation implies that the criticality may not enhance but
weaken the precision in the presence of two-photon relaxation. It can be well
described by the non-linearity introduced by the two-photon relaxation.

exploits this stochasticity to extract high-fidelity histograms of the votes

learn sensitive attributes of the input such as race, gender, or age. Although
this attack does not directly violate the differential privacy guarantee, it

impressive, the sparsity of point clouds, especially for the points far away,
making it difficult for the LiDAR-only refinement module to accurately
recognize and locate objects.To address this problem, we propose a novel
multi-modality two-stage approach named FusionRCNN, which effectively and
efficiently fuses point clouds and camera images in the Regions of
Interest(RoI). FusionRCNN adaptively integrates both sparse geometry
information from LiDAR and dense texture information from camera in a unified
attention mechanism. Specifically, it first utilizes RoIPooling to obtain an
image set with a unified size and gets the point set by sampling raw points
within proposals in the RoI extraction step; then leverages an intra-modality
self-attention to enhance the domain-specific features, following by a
well-designed cross-attention to fuse the information from two
modalities.FusionRCNN is fundamentally plug-and-play and supports different
one-stage methods with almost no architectural changes. Extensive experiments
on KITTI and Waymo benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly boosts
the performances of popular detectors.Remarkably, FusionRCNN significantly
improves the strong SECOND baseline by 6.14% mAP on Waymo, and outperforms
competing two-stage approaches. Code will be released soon at

Inconsistent editing is that swapping the attribute editing orders can not

work, we put forward three concepts and corresponding definitions: editing
continuity, consistency, and reversibility. Then, we propose a novel model to
achieve the goal of editing continuity, consistency, and reversibility. A
sufficient criterion is defined to determine whether a model is continuous,

ODEs with appropriate inductive biases have also been shown to give similar
performances. However, these models, when applied to particle based systems,
are transductive in nature and hence, do not generalize to large system sizes.
In this paper, we present a graph based neural ODE, GNODE, to learn the time
evolution of dynamical systems. Further, we carefully analyse the role of
different inductive biases on the performance of GNODE. We show that, similar
to LNN and HNN, encoding the constraints explicitly can significantly improve
the training efficiency and performance of GNODE significantly. Our experiments
also assess the value of additional inductive biases, such as Newtons third

biases can enhance the performance of model by orders of magnitude in terms of
both energy violation and rollout error. Interestingly, we observe that the
GNODE trained with the most effective inductive biases, namely MCGNODE,
outperforms the graph versions of LNN and HNN, namely, Lagrangian graph

cast edges that exhibit nonsmooth behavior. For example, inside the global
workspace bounds of a five-bar linkage appear several local workspace bounds
that only constrain certain output modes of the mechanism. The presence of such

source of confusion when these projections are studied exclusively instead of
the configuration manifold itself. Particularly, the design of nonsymmetric
parallel manipulators has been confounded by the presence of exotic projections
in their input and output spaces. In this paper, we represent the configuration
space with a radius graph, then weight each edge by solving an optimization
problem using homotopy continuation to quantify transmission quality. We then
employ a graph path planner to approximate geodesics between configuration
points that avoid regions of low transmission quality. Our methodology
automatically generates paths capable of transitioning between non-neighboring
output modes, a motion which involves osculating multiple workspace boundaries

fragility of this two-dimensional system in the atmosphere, the investigation
of its intrinsic superconductivity and intertwined orders has largely been
limited to surface-sensitive charge probes compatible with ultra-high vacuum
environment. However, the superconducting phase coherence of the interface is
challenging to probe. Here, we perform in-situ mutual inductance in ultra-high
vacuum on FeSe/STO in combination with band mapping by angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We find that even though the monolayer
showed a gap-closing temperature above 50 K, surprisingly no diamagnetism is
visible down to 5 K. This is the case for few-layer FeSe/STO until it exceeds a
critical number of 5 layers where diamagnetism suddenly appears. But the
superfluid density does not saturate down to the base temperature in these
thick samples. On the other hand, the suppression of diamagnetism in the
few-layer FeSe/STO can be lifted by depositing a FeTe layer on top. The
superconducting transition is much sharper than that in the thick FeSe/STO.
However, Tc and superfluid density both decrease with increasing FeTe
thickness. Shining ultraviolet light on the FeTe/FeSe/STO heterostructure
enhances Tc similarly independent of the FeSe thickness, showing that the
diamagnetism originates at the FeSe/STO interface. Our observation may be
understood by a scenario in which interfacial superconducting phase coherence

alleviated in the Bayesian parameter estimation framework by adopting
scientifically motivated new priors. I modelled the emission-line fluxes of
galaxies using the strong-line method and four model parameters-metallicity 12

$\lambda$5007 line flux and intrinsic [N II] $\lambda$6584 line flux. Based on
mock-data tests, I found that all input values can be recovered within and
around the 1-$\sigma$ credible interval by adopting suitable priors for the

inverse gamma distribution reflecting the logical constraint that an intrinsic
emission-line flux must exceed the observed (reddened) emission-line flux. The

excess input values [E(B - V) = 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5] and two metallicity input
values [12 + log (O/H) = 8.0 and 8.5]. I also found that the new prior can
diminish the SFR overestimation eightfold. This study demonstrates how the
Bayesian parameter estimation can achieve more accurate estimates with no
further observations when the likelihood does not constrain the model

magnetisation of the interstellar medium (ISM) that we observe in the Universe
today. The SSD efficiently converts kinetic energy $E_{\rm kin}$ into magnetic
energy $E_{\rm mag}$, and is often used to explain how an initially weak
magnetic field with $E_{\rm mag} \ll E_{\rm kin}$ is amplified, and then
maintained at a level $E_{\rm mag} \lesssim E_{\rm kin}$. Usually, this process
is studied by initialising a weak seed magnetic field and letting the
turbulence grow it to saturation. However, in this study, using
three-dimensional, non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical turbulence simulations, we
show that the same saturated state can also be achieved if initially $E_{\rm
mag} \gg E_{\rm kin}$ or $E_{\rm mag} \sim E_{\rm kin}$. This is realised
through a two-stage exponential decay (1. a slow backreaction that converts
$E_{\rm mag}$ into $E_{\rm kin}$, and 2. Ohmic dissipation concentrated in
anisotropic current sheets) into the saturated state, for which we provide an
analytical model. This means that even if there are temporary local
enhancements of $E_{\rm mag}$ in the ISM, such that $E_{\rm mag} > E_{\rm
kin}$, e.g., through amplifications such as compressions, over a long enough
time the field will decay into the saturated state set by the SSD, which is
determined by the turbulence and magnetic dissipation. However, we also provide
analytical models for the decay times and utilise wait-time statistics from
compressive supernova events to show that if the magnetic field is enhanced

  Orchestration",,,,,"cs.NI cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As computing power is becoming the core productivity of the digital economy
era, the concept of Computing and Network Convergence (CNC), under which
network and computing resources can be dynamically scheduled and allocated
according to users' needs, has been proposed and attracted wide attention.
Based on the tasks' properties, the network orchestration plane needs to
flexibly deploy tasks to appropriate computing nodes and arrange paths to the
computing nodes. This is a orchestration problem that involves resource
scheduling and path arrangement. Since CNC is relatively new, in this paper, we
review some researches and applications on CNC. Then, we design a CNC
orchestration method using reinforcement learning (RL), which is the first
attempt, that can flexibly allocate and schedule computing resources and
network resources. Which aims at high profit and low latency. Meanwhile, we use
multi-factors to determine the optimization objective so that the orchestration
strategy is optimized in terms of total performance from different aspects,
such as cost, profit, latency and system overload in our experiment. The
experiments shows that the proposed RL-based method can achieve higher profit
and lower latency than the greedy method, random selection and
balanced-resource method. We demonstrate RL is suitable for CNC orchestration.
This paper enlightens the RL application on CNC orchestration.

two essential tasks for constructing and applying knowledge graphs. Existing
unsupervised approaches turn out to be suitable candidates for jointly learning
the two tasks due to their avoidance of using graph-text parallel data.
However, they are composed of multiple modules and still require both entity
information and relation type in the training process. To this end, we propose
INFINITY, a simple yet effective unsupervised approach that does not require
external annotation tools or additional parallel information. It achieves fully
unsupervised graph-text mutual conversion for the first time. Specifically,
INFINITY treats both G2T and T2G as a bidirectional sequence generation task by
fine-tuning only one pretrained seq2seq model. A novel back-translation-based
framework is then designed to automatically generate continuous synthetic
parallel data. To obtain reasonable graph sequences with structural information
from source texts, INFINITY employs reward-based training loss by leveraging
the advantage of reward augmented maximum likelihood. As a fully unsupervised
framework, INFINITY is empirically verified to outperform state-of-the-art
baselines for G2T and T2G tasks.

nature and the growth of the black holes in the early Universe. In this paper,
we selected 9 radio-loud quasars at $z>3.5$ which display milliarcsec-scale jet
morphology. We provided evidence on the source nature by presenting
high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) images of the sample
at 8.4~GHz frequency and making spectral index maps. We also consider Gaia
optical positions that are available for 7 out of the 9 quasars, for a better
identification of the jet components within the radio structures. We find that
6 sources can be classified as core--jet blazars. The remaining 3 objects are
more likely young, jetted radio sources, compact symmetric objects. By
including multi-epoch archival VLBI data, we also obtained jet component proper
motions of the sample and estimated the jet kinematic and geometric parameters
(Doppler factor, Lorentz factor, viewing angle). Our results show that at
$z>3.5$, the jet apparent transverse speeds do not exceed 20 times the speed of
light ($c$). This is consistent with earlier high-redshift quasar measurements
in the literature and the tendency derived from low-redshift blazars that fast
jet speeds ($>40\,c$) only occur at low redshifts. The results from this paper

as a candidate for the TRS breaking state. However, a microscopic model for the
emergence of the loop-current CDW due to electronic correlations is still
lacking. Here, we calculate the susceptibility of the real and imaginary bond
orders on the kagom\'e lattice near van Hove filling, and reveal the importance
of next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V_2$ in triggering the instability
toward imaginary bond ordered CDW. The concrete effective single-orbital
$t$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model on the kagom\'e lattice is then studied, where $t$ and
$V_1$ are the hopping and Coulomb repulsion on the nearest-neighbor bonds. We
obtain the mean-field ground states, analyze their properties, and determine
the phase diagram in the plane spanned by $V_1$ and $V_2$ at van Hove filling.
The region dominated by $V_1$ is occupied by a $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ real CDW
insulator with the inverse of Star-of-David (ISD) bond configuration.
Increasing $V_2$ indeed drives a first-order transition from ISD to stabilized
loop-current insulators that exhibit four possible current patterns of
different topological properties, leading to orbital Chern insulators. We then
extend these results away from van Hove filling and show that electron doping
helps the stabilization of loop currents, and gives rise to doped orbital Chern
insulators with emergent Chern Fermi pockets carrying large Berry curvature and
orbital magnetic moment. Our findings provide a concrete model realization of

improve the quality of treatment for FoG, devising a computer-aided detection

non-invasive technique for collecting motion patterns, the footstep pressure
sequences obtained from pressure sensitive gait mats provide a great
opportunity for evaluating FoG in the clinic and potentially in the home
environment. In this study, FoG detection is formulated as a sequential
modelling task and a novel deep learning architecture, namely Adversarial
Spatio-temporal Network (ASTN), is proposed to learn FoG patterns across
multiple levels. A novel adversarial training scheme is introduced with a
multi-level subject discriminator to obtain subject-independent FoG
representations, which helps to reduce the over-fitting risk due to the high
inter-subject variance. As a result, robust FoG detection can be achieved for
unseen subjects. The proposed scheme also sheds light on improving
subject-level clinical studies from other scenarios as it can be integrated

one of the first studies of footstep pressure-based FoG detection and the
approach of utilizing ASTN is the first deep neural network architecture in

  Position","8 pages, 8 figures, Submitted to IEEE RAL",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-agent exploration of a bounded 3D environment with unknown initial
positions of agents is a challenging problem. It requires quickly exploring the
environments as well as robustly merging the sub-maps built by the agents. We
take the view that the existing approaches are either aggressive or
conservative: Aggressive strategies merge two sub-maps built by different
agents together when overlap is detected, which can lead to incorrect merging
due to the false-positive detection of the overlap and is thus not robust.
Conservative strategies direct one agent to revisit an excessive amount of the
historical trajectory of another agent for verification before merging, which
can lower the exploration efficiency due to the repeated exploration of the
same space. To intelligently balance the robustness of sub-map merging and
exploration efficiency, we develop a new approach for lidar-based multi-agent
exploration, which can direct one agent to repeat another agent's trajectory in
an \emph{adaptive} manner based on the quality indicator of the sub-map merging
process. Additionally, our approach extends the recent single-agent
hierarchical exploration strategy to multiple agents in a \emph{cooperative}
manner by planning for agents with merged sub-maps together to further improve
exploration efficiency. Our experiments show that our approach is up to 50\%
more efficient than the baselines on average while merging sub-maps robustly.

privacy-preserving average consensus (PPAC) for vector-valued multi-agent

collaboratively reach an exact average consensus of their initial states, while
each agent's initial state cannot be disclosed to other agents. We show that
the vector-valued PPAC problem can be solved via associated matrix-weighted
networks with the higher-dimensional agent state. Specifically, a novel
distributed vector-valued PPAC algorithm is proposed by lifting the agent-state
to higher-dimensional space and designing the associated matrix-weighted
network with dynamic, low-rank, positive semi-definite coupling matrices to
both conceal the vector-valued agent state and guarantee that the multi-agent
network asymptotically converges to the average consensus. Essentially, the
convergence analysis can be transformed into the average consensus problem on
switching matrix-weighted networks. We show that the exact average consensus
can be guaranteed and the initial agents' states can be kept private if each
agent has at least one ""legitimate"" neighbor. The algorithm, involving only
basic matrix operations, is computationally more efficient than
cryptography-based approaches and can be implemented in a fully distributed

serves as a realistic study case, in its planned development for the year 2030,

batteries and pumped-hydro are selected as the representative technologies to
include in the storage mix, assuming energy-to-power ratios of up to 6 hours

of a suitable mixture of storage facilities may improve renewable energy
integration and, at the same time, reduce system cost to the extent that
entirely compensates for the full cost of storage, thus allowing for a net
economic benefit for the system. The optimum storage portfolio for the study

earlier-ejected matter. Optically thick winds blow continuously at a rate of
$\sim 10^{-4} ~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ near the optical maximum, but its velocity
decreases toward the optical maximum and increases afterward, so that the shock
arises only after the optical maximum. The nova ejecta is divided by the shock
into three parts, the outermost expanding gas (earliest wind before maximum),
shocked shell, and inner fast wind, which respectively contribute to
pre-maximum, principal, and diffuse-enhanced absorption/emission line systems.
A large part of nova ejecta is eventually confined to the shocked shell. The
appearance of the principal system is consistent with the emergence of a shock.
This shock is strong enough to explain thermal hard X-ray emissions. The

Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) has achieved remarkable performance in
text generation, or natural language generation (NLG), which needs the
processing of a large input context in the summarization stage, followed by the
generation stage that produces a single word at a time. The conventional
platforms such as GPU are specialized for the parallel processing of large
inputs in the summarization stage, but their performance significantly degrades
in the generation stage due to its sequential characteristic. Therefore, an
efficient hardware platform is required to address the high latency caused by
the sequential characteristic of text generation.
  In this paper, we present DFX, a multi-FPGA acceleration appliance that
executes GPT-2 model inference end-to-end with low latency and high throughput
in both summarization and generation stages. DFX uses model parallelism and
optimized dataflow that is model-and-hardware-aware for fast simultaneous
workload execution among devices. Its compute cores operate on custom
instructions and provide GPT-2 operations end-to-end. We implement the proposed
hardware architecture on four Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGAs and utilize all of the
channels of the high bandwidth memory (HBM) and the maximum number of compute
resources for high hardware efficiency. DFX achieves 5.58x speedup and 3.99x

quantum analogue of the well-known classical Merkle tree. It gives a succinct
verification protocol for quantum state commitment. Although they only proved
security against semi-honest provers, they conjectured its general security.
Using the proposed quantum Merkle tree, they gave a quantum analogue of
Kilian's succinct argument for NP, which is based on probabilistically
checkable proofs (PCPs). A nice feature of Kilian's argument is that it can be
extended to a zero-knowledge succinct argument for NP, if the underlying PCP is
zero-knowledge. Hence, a natural question is whether one can also make the
quantum succinct argument by Chen and Movassagh zero-knowledge as well. This
work makes progress on this problem. We generalize the recent result of
Broadbent and Grilo to show that any local quantum verifier can be made
simulable with a minor reduction in completeness and soundness. Roughly
speaking, a local quantum verifier is simulable if in the yes case, the local
views of the verifier can be computed without knowing the actual quantum proof;
it can be seen as the quantum analogue of the classical zero-knowledge PCPs.
Hence we conjecture that applying the proposed succinct quantum argument of
Chen and Movassagh to a simulable local verifier is indeed zero-knowledge.

the most common problems is that the time series data could have missing values
by the inherent nature of the data collection process. So imputing missing
values from multivariate (correlated) time series data is imperative to improve
a prediction performance while making an accurate data-driven decision.
Conventional works for imputation simply delete missing values or fill them
based on mean/zero. Although recent works based on deep neural networks have
shown remarkable results, they still have a limitation to capture the complex
generation process of the multivariate time series. In this paper, we propose a
novel imputation method for multivariate time series data, called STING
(Self-attention based Time-series Imputation Networks using GAN). We take
advantage of generative adversarial networks and bidirectional recurrent neural
networks to learn latent representations of the time series. In addition, we
introduce a novel attention mechanism to capture the weighted correlations of
the whole sequence and avoid potential bias brought by unrelated ones.
Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that STING
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation
accuracy as well as downstream tasks with the imputed values therein.

solve this problem, we propose a novel framework for generating robust

future forecasts, we introduce the notion of an adversary, which perturbs
observed historical time series to increase a robot's ultimate control cost.
Specifically, we model this interaction as a zero-sum two-player game between a
robot's forecaster and this hypothetical adversary. We show that our proposed
game may be solved to a local Nash equilibrium using gradient-based
optimization techniques. Furthermore, we show that a forecaster trained with
our method performs 30.14% better on out-of-distribution real-world lane change

with the development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and
corresponding encoders, which embed real-world images into the latent space.
However, designing encoders of GAN still remains a challenging task due to the
trade-off between distortion and perception. In this paper, we point out that
the existing encoders try to lower the distortion not only on the interest
region, e.g., human facial region but also on the uninterest region, e.g.,
background patterns and obstacles. However, most uninterest regions in
real-world images are located at out-of-distribution (OOD), which are
infeasible to be ideally reconstructed by generative models. Moreover, we
empirically find that the uninterest region overlapped with the interest region
can mangle the original feature of the interest region, e.g., a microphone
overlapped with a facial region is inverted into the white beard. As a result,
lowering the distortion of the whole image while maintaining the perceptual
quality is very challenging. To overcome this trade-off, we propose a simple
yet effective encoder training scheme, coined IntereStyle, which facilitates
encoding by focusing on the interest region. IntereStyle steers the encoder to
disentangle the encodings of the interest and uninterest regions. To this end,
we filter the information of the uninterest region iteratively to regulate the
negative impact of the uninterest region. We demonstrate that IntereStyle
achieves both lower distortion and higher perceptual quality compared to the
existing state-of-the-art encoders. Especially, our model robustly conserves
features of the original images, which shows the robust image editing and style
mixing results. We will release our code with the pre-trained model after the
review.

solutions to the Cauchy problem on the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation near

$\|\mathcal{F}_x{f}_0\|_{L^1\cap L^p (\mathbb{R}^3_k;L^2(\mathbb{R}^3_v))}$
with $3/2<p\leq \infty$ is imposed on initial data $f_0(x,v)$, where
$\mathcal{F}_x{f}_0(k,v)$ is the Fourier transform in space variable. This
provides the first result on the global existence of such low-regularity
solutions without relying on Sobolev embedding $H^2(\mathbb{R}^3_x)\subset
L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3_x)$ in case of the whole space. Different from the use of
sufficiently smooth Sobolev spaces in those classical results by
Gressman-Strain and AMUXY, there is a crucial difference between the torus case
and the whole space case for low regularity solutions under consideration. In
fact, for the former, it is enough to take the only $L^1_k$ norm corresponding
to the Weiner space as studied in Duan-Liu-Sakamoto-Strain. In contrast, for
the latter, the extra interplay with the $L^p_k$ norm plays a vital role in
controlling the nonlinear collision term due to the degenerate dissipation of
the macroscopic component. Indeed, the propagation of $L^p_k$ norm helps gain
an almost optimal decay rate $ (1+t)^{-\frac{3}{2} (1-\frac{1}{p})_+}$ of the
$L^1_k$ norm via the time-weighted energy estimates in the spirit of the idea
of Kawashima-Nishibata-Nishikawa and in turn, this is necessarily used for
establishing the global existence.

gaps greater than $g$ decays as $\sim g^{D_{\mathrm{f}}-2}$ for $g\ll \ell$ and
$\sim g^{-D_{\mathrm{f}}}$ for $g \gg \ell$. Finally, conditioned on the number
of particles $n$, the above distributions are valid for $g \ll \sqrt{n}$; the
average number of gaps greater than $g \gg \sqrt{n}$ is much less than one, and
decays as $\simeq 4 (g/\sqrt{n})^{-2}$, in agreement with the universal gap

algorithm named smoothed proximal linear descent-ascent (smoothed PLDA), which
can effectively handle a broad range of structured nonsmooth
nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems. Specifically, we consider the setting
where the primal function has a nonsmooth composite structure and the dual
function possesses the Kurdyka-\L{}ojasiewicz (K\L{}) property with exponent
$\theta \in [0,1)$. We introduce a novel convergence analysis framework for
smoothed PLDA, the key components of which are our newly developed nonsmooth

show that smoothed PLDA can find both $\epsilon$-game-stationary points and
$\epsilon$-optimization-stationary points of the problems of interest in
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2\max\{2\theta,1\}})$ iterations. Furthermore, when
$\theta \in [0,1/2]$, smoothed PLDA achieves the optimal iteration complexity
of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$. To further demonstrate the effectiveness and
wide applicability of our analysis framework, we show that certain

quantitative relationships among various stationarity concepts, which may be of

relic abundance. These channels are described by DM annihilations into heavier
states, which vanish at zero temperature limit, but occur at finite
temperatures in the early Universe. For the case that the final state of the
forbidden channel is scalar mediators that couple to Standard Model (SM) matter
through mixing with the SM Higgs, the signals from DM-nucleon interactions and
from mediator-related missing energy or displaced vertices could be detected by
direct detections and particle physics experiments, respectively. We thus
present a study on the simplest secluded vector dark matter model that can
exhibit this scenario in the mass range from sub-GeV to TeV. The dark matter
resides in the hidden sector, which is in thermal equilibrium with the SM
before freeze-out. During freeze-out, the depletion of its density results from
its annihilation into two heavier but metastable scalars, where the coupling
can be determined by having the correct relic density and constrained by the
perturbative unitarity bound. However, much of the allowed parameter space is
insensitive to the mixing angle between the hidden scalar and SM Higgs. We find
that a more significant mass splitting between DM and the mediator can be
allowed only in the sub-GeV region. Moreover, the mass splitting in the TeV
region is required to be within the percent level. This model of the forbidden
DM interacting with SM particles through the scalar portal is testable in
experiments.

solve the soft margin optimization problem with the $\ell_1$-norm
regularization. LPBoost rapidly converges to an $\epsilon$-approximate solution
in practice, but it is known to take $\Omega(m)$ iterations in the worst case,
where $m$ is the sample size. On the other hand, ERLPBoost and C-ERLPBoost are
guaranteed to converge to an $\epsilon$-approximate solution in
$O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2} \ln \frac{m}{\nu})$ iterations. However, the
computation per iteration is very high compared to LPBoost.
  To address this issue, we propose a generic boosting scheme that combines the
Frank-Wolfe algorithm and any secondary algorithm and switches one to the other
iteratively. We show that the scheme retains the same convergence guarantee as
ERLPBoost and C-ERLPBoost. One can incorporate any secondary algorithm to
improve in practice. This scheme comes from a unified view of boosting
algorithms for soft margin optimization. More specifically, we show that
LPBoost, ERLPBoost, and C-ERLPBoost are instances of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm.
In experiments on real datasets, one of the instances of our scheme exploits
the better updates of the secondary algorithm and performs comparably with
LPBoost.

assume that it is a pure hot fireball launched by neutrino-antineutrino
annihilation mechanism only. Moreover, the outflow has larger $\eta$ with lower
luminosity $L$ in the first few seconds, so that the trend of time-resolved
$\eta-L$ can not be described as a monotonically positive correlation between
$\eta$ and $L$. A hybrid outflow with almost completely thermalized Poynting
flux could account for the quasi-thermal spectrum as well as large $\eta$. More
importantly, the existence of magnetic field could affect the proton density
and neutron-proton coupling effect, so that it could account for the observed
trend of time-resolved $\eta-L$. The other origins for the photospheric
emission, such as non-dissipative hybrid outflow or magnetic reconnection, are
not supported because their radiation efficiencies are low, which is not
consistent with non-detection of the afterglow for GRB 220426A. Therefore, we
think the hybrid outflow may be the most likely origin.

Although visual attention mechanisms have achieved great success in computer

fundamental limitations in building an effective regression loss for rotation
detection, especially for high-precision detection with high IoU (e.g. 0.75).
Instead, we propose to model the rotated objects as Gaussian distributions. A
direct advantage is that our new regression loss regarding the distance between
two Gaussians e.g. Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), can well align the actual
detection performance metric, which is not well addressed in existing methods.
Moreover, the two bottlenecks i.e. boundary discontinuity and square-like
problem also disappear. We also propose an efficient Gaussian metric-based
label assignment strategy to further boost the performance. Interestingly, by
analyzing the BBox parameters' gradients under our Gaussian-based KLD loss, we
show that these parameters are dynamically updated with interpretable physical
meaning, which help explain the effectiveness of our approach, especially for
high-precision detection. We extend our approach from 2-D to 3-D with a

dominated by laser frequency noise. The standard technique to make this data
usable for science is time-delay interferometry (TDI), which cancels laser
noise terms by forming suitable combinations of delayed measurements. We
recently introduced the basic concepts of an alternative approach which, unlike
TDI, does not rely on independent knowledge of temporal correlations in the
dominant noise. Instead, our automated Principal Component Interferometry
(aPCI) processing only assumes that one can produce some linear combinations of
the temporally nearby regularly spaced phase measurements, which cancel the
laser noise. Then we let the data reveal those combinations. Our previous work
relies on the simplifying additional assumption that the filters which lead to
the laser-noise-free data streams are time-independent. In LISA, however, these
filters will vary as the constellation armlengths evolve. Here, we discuss a
generalization of the basic aPCI concept compatible with data dominated by a
still unmodeled but slowly varying noise covariance. Despite its independence
on any model, aPCI successfully mitigates laser frequency noise below the other
noises' level, and its sensitivity to gravitational waves is the same as the
state-of-the-art second-generation TDI, up to a 2\% error.

city dynamics over time and space. To address this issue, we analyze scaling
between city infrastructure and population across 857 United States
metropolitan areas over an unprecedented 115 years using dasymetrically refined
historical population estimates, historical urban road network models, and
multi-temporal settlement data to define dynamic city boundaries based on
settlement density. We demonstrate the clearest evidence that urban scaling
exponents can closely match theoretical models over a century if cities are
defined as dense settlement patches. Despite the close quantitative agreement
with theory, the empirical scaling relations unexpectedly vary across regions.
Our analysis of scaling coefficients, meanwhile, reveals that a city in 2015
uses more developed land and kilometers of road than a city with a similar
population in 1900, which has serious implications for urban development and
impacts on the local environment. Overall, our results offer a new way to study
urban systems based on novel, geohistorical data.

of lithium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the transport mechanism responsible for
the long-term growth of the SEI remains controversial. This study aims at
discussing the characteristic time and state-of-charge dependence of SEI growth
mediated by electron diffusion versus solvent diffusion. We describe both
transport mechanisms with continuum models and compare them to experimental
results. We show that electron diffusion can explain both the observed
state-of-charge dependence and the time dependence. In contrast, we demonstrate
that solvent diffusion can reproduce either the state-of-charge dependence or
the time dependence of capacity fade. There is no intermediate regime where
solvent diffusion can explain both dependencies simultaneously. Furthermore, we
emphasize the crucial role of anode voltage and state-of-charge on SEI growth
in general. Due to self-discharge, this dependence can explain deviations from
the typical square-root behavior in the time domain. We conclude that electron
diffusion is the relevant process leading to the state-of-charge dependent SEI
growth. Further experiments are needed to investigate the reason for
contributions to the capacity fade that are independent of the state-of-charge.

the prospect that a PDW state may exist in this material. To search for it, we
visualize the pairing energy-gap with $\mu$$eV$-scale energy-resolution using
superconductive STM tips. We detect three PDWs, each with peak-peak gap

known comet of its kind. Understanding its dynamical history is therefore of
essential importance as it would allow us to gain a clearer understanding of
the evolution of planetesimal formation in our Solar System. Two studies have
independently estimated the possible origin of this comet from building blocks
formed in a peculiar region of the protoplanetary disk, near the ice line of CO
and N2. We intend to investigate the fates of objects formed from the building
blocks in these regions. We hope to find a possible explanation for the lack of
C/2016 R2-like comets in our Solar System. Using a numerical simulation of the
early stages of Solar System formation, we track the dynamics of these objects
in the Jumping Neptune scenario based on five different initial conditions for
the protosolar disk. We integrate the positions of 250 000 planetesimals over
time in order to analyze the evolution of their orbits and create a statistical
profile of their expected permanent orbit. Results. We find that objects formed
in the region of the CO- and N2- ice lines are highly likely to be sent towards
the Oort Cloud or possibly ejected from the Solar System altogether on a
relatively short timescale. In all our simulations, over 90% of clones formed
in this region evolved into a hyperbolic trajectory, and between 1% and 10%
were potentially captured by the Oort Cloud. The handful of comets that
remained were either on long-period, highly eccentric orbits like C/2016 R2, or
absorbed into the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt. Comets formed <15 au were
predominantly ejected early in the formation timeline. As this is the formation
zone likely to produce comets of this composition, this process could explain

desired. We find that existing approaches are assessed solely through user
studies. There is a need for a benchmark with ground truth summaries to
complement assessment through user studies. Unfortunately, such a benchmark is
non-existent for answer summarization for technical queries from SQA sites. To
fill the gap, we manually construct a high-quality benchmark to enable
automatic evaluation of answer summarization for technical queries for SQA
sites. Using the benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of
existing approaches and find that there is still a big room for improvement.
  Motivated by the results, we propose a new approach TechSumBot with three key
modules:1) Usefulness Ranking module, 2) Centrality Estimation module, and 3)
Redundancy Removal module. We evaluate TechSumBot in both automatic (i.e.,
using our benchmark) and manual (i.e., via a user study) manners. The results
from both evaluations consistently demonstrate that TechSumBot outperforms the
best performing baseline approaches from both SE and NLP domains by a large
margin, i.e., 10.83%-14.90%, 32.75%-36.59%, and 12.61%-17.54%, in terms of
ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L on automatic evaluation, and 5.79%-9.23% and
17.03%-17.68%, in terms of average usefulness and diversity score on human
evaluation. This highlights that the automatic evaluation of our benchmark can
uncover findings similar to the ones found through user studies. More
importantly, automatic evaluation has a much lower cost, especially when it is
used to assess a new approach. Additionally, we also conducted an ablation
study, which demonstrates that each module in TechSumBot contributes to
boosting the overall performance of TechSumBot.

previously [G\'omez Gonz\'alez, Khalil, and Garz\'o, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{101},

coefficients associated with the heat flux. These transport coefficients are
obtained by solving the Enskog equation by means of the application of the
Chapman--Enskog method around the local version of the homogeneous state.
Explicit forms of the heat flux transport coefficients are provided in
steady-state conditions by considering the so-called second Sonine
approximation to the distribution function of each species. Their quantitative
variation on the control parameters of the mixture (masses and diameters,
coefficients of restitution, concentration, volume fraction, and the background
temperature) is demonstrated and the results show that in general the
dependence of the heat flux transport coefficients on inelasticity is clearly
different from that found in the absence of the gas phase (\emph{dry} granular
mixtures). As an application of the general results, the stability of the
homogeneous steady state is analyzed by solving the linearized Navier--Stokes
hydrodynamic equations. The linear stability analysis (which holds for
wavelengths long compared with the mean free path) shows that the transversal
and longitudinal modes are always stable with respect to long-enough wavelength
excitations. This conclusion agrees with previous results derived for
monocomponent and (dilute) bidisperse granular suspensions but contrasts with
the instabilities found in previous works in dry (no gas phase) granular
mixtures.

applications in the areas of chemistry, condensed matter physics, material
science, optics, and many more. Not surprisingly, there is significant interest
in their efficient simulation. However, direct classical simulation quickly
becomes intractable with coupling to an environment whose effective dimension
grows exponentially. This raises the question: can quantum computers help model
these complex dynamics? A first step in answering this question requires
understanding the computational complexity of this task. Here, we map the
temporal complexity of a process to the spatial complexity of a many-body state
using a computational model known as the process tensor framework. With this,
we are able to explore the simulation complexity of an open quantum system as a
dynamic sampling problem: a system coupled to an environment can be probed at
successive points in time -- accessing multi-time correlations. The complexity
of multi-time sampling, which is an important and interesting problem in its
own right, contains the complexity of master equations and stochastic maps as a
special case. Our results show how the complexity of the underlying quantum
stochastic process corresponds to the complexity of the associated family of
master equations for the dynamics. We present both analytical and numerical
examples whose multi-time sampling is as complex as sampling from a many-body
state that is classically hard. This also implies that the corresponding family
of master equations are classically hard. Our results pave the way for studying
open quantum systems from a complexity-theoretic perspective, highlighting the
role quantum computers will play in our understanding of quantum dynamics.

seminally introducing interacting stresses across erosion-interface. Shear
resistances from the bed against shear stresses from the landslide are based on
consistent physical principles. Proposed multi-phase interactive shear
structures are mechanically superior and dynamically flexible. Total erosion
rate is the sum of solid and fluid erosion rates which are mechanically

The Spectral Energy Distribution machine (SEDm), a low resolution Integral

classify targets detected by the ZTF main camera. The current Pysedm pipeline
is limited by contamination when the transient is too close to its host galaxy
core; this can lead to an incorrect typing and ultimately bias the cosmological

properties. We present a new scene modeler to extract the transient spectrum
from its structured background, aiming at improving the typing efficiency of
the SEDm. HyperGal is a fully chromatic scene modeler, which uses pre-transient
photometric images to generate a hyperspectral model of the host galaxy; it is

interpolator. The galaxy model, complemented by a point source and a diffuse
background component, is projected onto the SEDm spectro-spatial observation
space and adjusted to observations. The full procedure is validated on 5000
simulated cubes. We introduce the contrast as the transient-to-total flux ratio

developments in the field, like stochastic-, black box- and amortized-VI, have
helped address these issues. Generative modeling tasks nowadays widely make use
of amortized VI for its efficiency and scalability, as it utilizes a
parameterized function to learn the approximate posterior density parameters.
With this paper, we review the mathematical foundations of various VI
techniques to form the basis for understanding amortized VI. Additionally, we
provide an overview of the recent trends that address several issues of
amortized VI, such as the amortization gap, generalization issues, inconsistent
representation learning, and posterior collapse. Finally, we analyze alternate
divergence measures that improve VI optimization.

riders post their origins and destinations, then the platform assigns drivers
to serve them. In ridesharing, different groups of riders can be served by one
driver if their trips can share common routes. Recently, many ridesharing
companies (e.g., Didi and Uber) further propose a new mode, namely ""ridesharing
with meeting points"". Specifically, with a short walking distance but less
payment, riders can be picked up and dropped off around their origins and
destinations, respectively. In addition, meeting points enables more flexible
routing for drivers, which can potentially improve the global profit of the
system. In this paper, we first formally define the Meeting-Point-based Online
Ridesharing Problem (MORP). We prove that MORP is NP-hard and there is no
polynomial-time deterministic algorithm with a constant competitive ratio for
it. We notice that a structure of vertex set, $k$-skip cover, fits well to the
MORP. $k$-skip cover tends to find the vertices (meeting points) that are
convenient for riders and drivers to come and go. With meeting points, MORP
tends to serve more riders with these convenient vertices. Based on the idea,
we introduce a convenience-based meeting point candidates selection algorithm.
We further propose a hierarchical meeting-point oriented graph (HMPO graph),
which ranks vertices for assignment effectiveness and constructs $k$-skip cover
to accelerate the whole assignment process. Finally, we utilize the merits of
$k$-skip cover points for ridesharing and propose a novel algorithm, namely
SMDB, to solve MORP. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets
validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.

are observed in GaN samples grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) and
then compared with defect properties predicted from first-principles
calculations. The vibrational frequency shift in two $^{13}C$ enriched samples
related to the effect of the isotope mass indicates six distinct configurations
of the carbon-containing point defects. The effect of the isotope replacement
is well reproduced by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
Specific attention is paid to the most pronounced defects, namely tri-carbon
complexes($C_N=C=C_N$) and carbon substituting for nitrogen $C_N$. The position
of the transition level (+/0) in the bandgap found for $C_N=C=C_N$ defects by
DFT at 1.1 eV above the valence band maximum, suggest that $(C_N=C=C_N)^+$
provides compensation of ${C_N}^-$. $C_N=C=C_N$ defects are observed to be
prominent, yet have high formation energies in DFT calculations. Regarding
${C_N}$ defects, it is shown that the host Ga and N atoms are involved in the
defect's delocalized vibrations and significantly affect the isotopic frequency
shift. Much more faint vibrational modes are found from di-atomic carbon-carbon
and carbon-hydrogen (C-H) complexes. Also, we note changes of vibrational mode
intensities of $C_N$, $C_N=C=C_N$, C-H, and $C_N-C_i$ defects in the IR
absorption spectra upon irradiation in the defect-related UV/visible absorption
range. Finally, it is demonstrated that the resonant enhancement of the Raman

defects at carbon doping concentrations as low as $3.2*10^{17} cm^{-3}$.

a dilute halo around a neutron star (NS). We show that DM condensed in a core
leads to a decrease of the total gravitational mass, radius and tidal
deformability compared to a pure baryonic star with the same central density,
which we will perceive as an effective softening of the equation of state
(EoS). On the other hand, the presence of a DM halo increases the tidal
deformability and total gravitational mass. As a result, an accumulated DM
inside compact stars could mimic an apparent stiffening of strongly interacting
matter equation of state and constraints we impose on it at high densities.
  From the performed analysis of the effect of DM particles in a MeV-GeV
mass-scale, interaction strength, and relative DM fractions inside NSs we
obtained a rigorous constraint on model parameters. Finally, we discuss several
smoking guns of the presence of DM that are free from the above mentioned
apparent modification of the strongly interacting matter equation of state.

Fredholm integro-differential equations. The non-smoothness of the solutions to
such problems leads to the performance of spectral methods based on the
classical polynomials such as Chebyshev, Legendre, Laguerre, etc, with a low
order of convergence. For this reason, the development of classic numerical
methods to solve such problems becomes a challenging issue. Since the
non-smooth solutions have the same asymptotic behavior with polynomials of
fractional powers, therefore, fractional basis functions are the best candidate
to overcome the drawbacks of the accuracy of the spectral methods. On the other
hand, the fractional integration of the fractional polynomials functions is in
the class of fractional polynomials and this is one of the main advantages of
using the fractional basis functions. In this paper, an implicit spectral
collocation method based on the fractional Chelyshkov basis functions is
introduced. The framework of the method is to reduce the problem into a
nonlinear system of equations utilizing the spectral collocation method along
with the fractional operational integration matrix. The obtained algebraic

study of NCO solvers and alternative solvers. Specifically, taking the
traveling salesman problem as the testbed problem, the performance of the
solvers is assessed in five aspects, i.e., effectiveness, efficiency,
stability, scalability, and generalization ability. Our results show that the
solvers learned by NCO approaches, in general, still fall short of traditional
solvers in nearly all these aspects. A potential benefit of NCO solvers would
be their superior time and energy efficiency for small-size problem instances
when sufficient training instances are available. Hopefully, this work would
help with a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of NCO and

  Microarchitecture (MICRO), 2022",,,,"cs.AR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are widely-used accelerators for
data-parallel applications. In many GPU applications, GPU memory bandwidth
bottlenecks performance, causing underutilization of GPU cores. Hence,
disabling many cores does not affect the performance of memory-bound workloads.
While simply power-gating unused GPU cores would save energy, prior works
attempt to better utilize GPU cores for other applications (ideally
compute-bound), which increases the GPU's total throughput.
  In this paper, we introduce Morpheus, a new hardware/software co-designed
technique to boost the performance of memory-bound applications. The key idea
of Morpheus is to exploit unused core resources to extend the GPU last level
cache (LLC) capacity. In Morpheus, each GPU core has two execution modes:
compute mode and cache mode. Cores in compute mode operate conventionally and
run application threads. However, for the cores in cache mode, Morpheus invokes
a software helper kernel that uses the cores' on-chip memories (i.e., register
file, shared memory, and L1) in a way that extends the LLC capacity for a
running memory-bound workload. Morpheus adds a controller to the GPU hardware
to forward LLC requests to either the conventional LLC (managed by hardware) or
the extended LLC (managed by the helper kernel). Our experimental results show
that Morpheus improves the performance and energy efficiency of a baseline GPU
architecture by an average of 39% and 58%, respectively, across several
memory-bound workloads. Morpheus' performance is within 3% of a GPU design that
has a quadruple-sized conventional LLC. Morpheus can thus contribute to
reducing the hardware dedicated to a conventional LLC by exploiting idle cores'
on-chip memory resources as additional cache capacity.

an efficient COarse-to-fiNE alignment framework. CONE is a plug-and-play

selection strategy to speed up inference, and (2) proposes a coarse-to-fine
mechanism via a novel incorporation of contrastive learning to enhance
multi-modal alignment for long videos. Extensive experiments on two large-scale
long VTG benchmarks consistently show both substantial performance gains (e.g.,
from 3.13% to 6.87% on MAD) and state-of-the-art results. Analyses also reveal
higher efficiency as the query-guided window selection mechanism accelerates
inference time by 2x on Ego4D-NLQ and 15x on MAD while keeping SOTA results.

misclassification in an important class (e.g., stop sign) can be significantly
more harmful than in other classes (e.g., speed limit). In this paper, we
propose a loss function that can improve the recall of an important class while
maintaining the same level of accuracy as the case using cross-entropy loss.
For our purpose, we need to make the separation of the important class better
than the other classes. However, existing methods that give a class-sensitive
penalty for cross-entropy loss do not improve the separation. On the other
hand, the method that gives a margin to the angle between the feature vectors
and the weight vectors of the last fully connected layer corresponding to each
feature can improve the separation. Therefore, we propose a loss function that
can improve the separation of the important class by setting the margin only
for the important class, called Class-sensitive Additive Angular Margin Loss
(CAMRI Loss). CAMRI loss is expected to reduce the variance of angles between
features and weights of the important class relative to other classes due to
the margin around the important class in the feature space by adding a penalty
to the angle. In addition, concentrating the penalty only on the important
classes hardly sacrifices the separation of the other classes. Experiments on
CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and AwA2 showed that the proposed method could improve up to
9% recall improvement on cross-entropy loss without sacrificing accuracy.

end-to-end manner. By designing mutual gaze instance triples, MGTR can detect
each human head bounding box and simultaneously infer mutual gaze relationship
based on global image information, which streamlines the whole process with

prone to faulty machines that may deviate from their prescribed algorithm

While many solutions have been proposed to enhance the robustness of D-SGD to
such machines, previous works either resort to strong assumptions (trusted
server, homogeneous data, specific noise model) or impose a gradient
computational cost that is several orders of magnitude higher than that of
D-SGD. We present MoNNA, a new algorithm that (a) is provably robust under

in the fraction of faulty machines, which is conjectured to be tight.
Essentially, MoNNA uses Polyak's momentum of local gradients for local updates
and nearest-neighbor averaging (NNA) for global mixing, respectively. While
MoNNA is rather simple to implement, its analysis has been more challenging and
relies on two key elements that may be of independent interest. Specifically,
we introduce the mixing criterion of $(\alpha, \lambda)$-reduction to analyze
the non-linear mixing of non-faulty machines, and present a way to control the
tension between the momentum and the model drifts. We validate our theory by

realize underwater propulsion with low energy cost. Complexity of the

difficult. In earlier studies, motion patterns are usually prescribed as
certain periodic functions which constrains the following optimization process
in a small subdomain of the whole motion space. In this work, to avoid this

various flapping motions into a simple action vector. Then we let a flapping
airfoil continuously interact with water tunnel environment and adjust its
action accordingly through a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. By this
automatic close-looped experiment, we obtain several motion patterns that can
result in high hydrodynamic efficiency comparing to pure harmonic motions with
the same thrust level. And we find that, after numerous trials and errors, RL
trainings in current experiment always converge to motion patterns that are
close to harmonic motions. In other words, current work proves that harmonic
motion with appropriate amplitude and frequency is always an optimal choice for
efficient underwater propulsion. Furthermore, the RL framework proposed here

superradiance) has been predicted and observed in various physical systems,
most recently in CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal superlattices. Superradiant emission is
coherent and occurs on timescales faster than the emission from isolated
nanocrystals. Theory predicts cooperative emission being faster by a factor of
up to the number of nanocrystals ($N$). However, superradiance is strongly
suppressed due to the presence of energetic disorder, stemming from nanocrystal
size variations and thermal decoherence. Here, we analyze superradiance from
superlattices of different dimensionalities (one-, two- and three-dimensional)
with variable nanocrystal aspect ratios. We predict as much as a 15-fold
enhancement in robustness against realistic values of energetic disorder in
three-dimensional (3D) superlattices composed of cuboid-shaped, as opposed to
cube-shaped, nanocrystals. Superradiance from small $(N\lesssim 10^3)$
two-dimensional (2D) superlattices is up to ten times more robust to static
disorder and up to twice as robust to thermal decoherence than 3D superlattices
with the same $N$. As the number of $N$ increases, a crossover in the
robustness of superradiance occurs from 2D to 3D superlattices. For large $N\
(> 10^3)$, the robustness in 3D superlattices increases with $N$, showing
cooperative robustness to disorder. This opens the possibility of observing
superradiance even at room temperature in large 3D superlattices, if

Recently, a new class of CNNs is proposed in which the conventional layers of

batch-normalization layers. The final classification layer in equivariant
neural networks is invariant to different affine geometric transformations such
as rotation, reflection and translation, and the scalar value is obtained by
either eliminating the spatial dimensions of filter responses using convolution
and down-sampling throughout the network or average is taken over the filter
responses. In this work, we propose to integrate the orthogonal moments which
gives the high-order statistics of the function as an effective means for
encoding global invariance with respect to rotation, reflection and translation
in fully-connected layers. As a result, the intermediate layers of the network
become equivariant while the classification layer becomes invariant. The most

considered for this purpose. The effectiveness of the proposed work is
evaluated by integrating the invariant transition and fully-connected layer in

generative models currently have the merit of attracting the general public
attention. Two of these models, DALL-E 2 and Imagen, have demonstrated that
highly photorealistic images could be generated from a simple textual
description of an image. Based on a novel approach for image generation called
diffusion models, text-to-image models enable the production of many different
types of high resolution images, where human imagination is the only limit.
  However, these models require exceptionally large amounts of computational
resources to train, as well as handling huge datasets collected from the
internet. In addition, neither the codebase nor the models have been released.
It consequently prevents the AI community from experimenting with these
cutting-edge models, making the reproduction of their results complicated, if
not impossible.
  In this thesis, we aim to contribute by firstly reviewing the different
approaches and techniques used by these models, and then by proposing our own
implementation of a text-to-image model. Highly based on DALL-E 2, we introduce
several slight modifications to tackle the high computational cost induced. We
thus have the opportunity to experiment in order to understand what these
models are capable of, especially in a low resource regime. In particular, we
provide additional and analyses deeper than the ones performed by the authors
of DALL-E 2, including ablation studies.
  Besides, diffusion models use so-called guidance methods to help the
generating process. We introduce a new guidance method which can be used in
conjunction with other guidance methods to improve image quality. Finally, the
images generated by our model are of reasonably good quality, without having to
sustain the significant training costs of state-of-the-art text-to-image
models.

shear-driven turbulence in weak stratification in late-summer and autumn, large
buoyancy-driven turbulence by geothermal heating from below alternated with
inertial internal wave motions in winter, and moderate buoyancy-like turbulence
pushed with stratified waters from above in late-winter and spring.

contrastive learning methods (e.g., SimCSE), which keep positive pairs similar
and push negative pairs apart. The contrast operation aims to keep as much
information as possible by maximizing the mutual information between positive
instances, which leads to redundant information in sentence embedding. To
address this problem, we present an information minimization based contrastive
learning (InforMin-CL) model to retain the useful information and discard the
redundant information by maximizing the mutual information and minimizing the
information entropy between positive instances meanwhile for unsupervised
sentence representation learning. Specifically, we find that information
minimization can be achieved by simple contrast and reconstruction objectives.
The reconstruction operation reconstitutes the positive instance via the other
positive instance to minimize the information entropy between positive
instances. We evaluate our model on fourteen downstream tasks, including both
supervised and unsupervised (semantic textual similarity) tasks. Extensive
experimental results show that our InforMin-CL obtains a state-of-the-art
performance.

associated with recurrent jets during an M1.2 flare on 2022 July 14. A
quasi-period of about 45$\pm$10 s, determined by the wavelet transform
technique, is simultaneously identified at wavelengths of soft/hard X-ray and
microwave emissions, which are recorded by the Gravitational wave high-energy
Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor, Fermi, and the Nobeyama Radio

cadence of about 45$\pm$10 s are found in Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
image series at 304 {\AA}, but they are 180-s earlier than the flare QPP. All
observational facts suggest that the flare QPP could be excited by recurrent
jets, and they should be associated with nonthermal electrons that are
periodically accelerated by a repeated energy release process, like repetitive
magnetic reconnection. Moreover, the same quasi-period is discovered at double
footpoints connected by a hot flare loop in AIA 94 {\AA}, and the phase speed
is measured to 1420 km/s. Based on the differential emission measure, the
average temperatures, number densities, and magnetic field strengths at the
loop top and footpoint are estimated to 7.7/6.7 MK, 7.5/3.6*10^{10} cm ^{-3},

paradigm of information theoretic tasks. Apart from Bell nonlocality, which
deals with measurement outcome statistics of spatially separated agents, there
is also another kind of quantum nonlocality, that is associated with perfect
distinguishability of quantum states by local operations and classical
communication (LOCC). We propose a distributed task: perfect identification of
subsets of a known set of multipartite orthogonal states by LOCC, namely, local
subset identification. Failure in accomplishing this task guarantees a new
notion of quantum nonlocality, viz., local subset unidentifiability. Here, we
show that both local distinguishability and local markability of quantum states
implies local subset identifiability, but the converse is not necessarily true.
This makes local subset unidentifiability a stronger quantum nonlocal
phenomenon than its predecessors -- local indistinguishability and local
unmarkability. Moreover, we also present an even stronger version of local
subset unidentifiablity involving more than two spatially separated parties
namely, genuine local subset unidentifiability, where a given subset becomes

incorporating a new channel Squeezed and Boosted (SB) and dilated

traditions, in particular when the underlying music theoretical assumptions do
not hold for these genres. Over the recent decade, a number of computational
problems related to the automatic analysis of flamenco music have been defined
and several methods addressing a variety of musical aspects have been proposed.
This paper provides an overview of the challenges which arise in the context of
computational analysis of flamenco music and outlines an overview of existing
approaches.

treatments at elevated pressures on this encapsulation layer remains
controversial, partly due to the 'pressure gap' between surface science studies

near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) to study the
effect of O$_2$ and H$_2$ on the SMSI-state of well-defined Pt/TiO$_2$(110)

either selectively oxidize the TiO$_2$ support or both the support and the Pt

rapidly in 1x10$^{-5}$ Torr O$_2$, but orders of magnitudes less effective at
higher O$_2$ pressures, where Pt is in an oxidic state. While the
oxidation/reduction of Pt particles is reversible, they remain embedded in the

the o-minimal structures, aimed at capturing some finer features of structures
arising from algebraic geometry and Hodge theory. Sharp o-minimality associates
to each definable set a pair of integers known as \emph{format} and
\emph{degree}, similar to the ambient dimension and degree in the algebraic
case; gives bounds on the growth of these quantities under the logical
operations; and allows one to control the geometric complexity of a set in
terms of its format and degree. These axioms have significant implications on
arithmetic properties of definable sets -- for example, \so-minimality was
recently used by the authors to settle Wilkie's conjecture on rational points
in $\mathbb{R}_{{\exp}}$-definable sets.
  In this paper we develop some basic theory of sharply o-minimal structures.
We introduce the notions of reduction and equivalence on the class of
\so-minimal structures. We give three variants of the definition of
\so-minimality, of increasing strength, and show that they all agree up to
reduction. We also consider the problem of ``sharp cell decomposition'', i.e.
cell decomposition with good control on the number of the cells and their
formats and degrees. We show that every \so-minimal structure can be reduced to
one admitting sharp cell decomposition, and use this to prove bounds on the
Betti numbers of definable sets in terms of format and degree.

optimization problems whose solutions are embedded into a ground state of the
Ising Hamiltonian. This method employs two types of Hamiltonians: a driver
Hamiltonian and a problem Hamiltonian. After a sufficiently slow change from
the driver Hamiltonian to the problem Hamiltonian, we can obtain the target
ground state that corresponds to the solution. The inclusion of non-stoquastic
terms in the driver Hamiltonian is believed to enhance the efficiency of the
QA. Meanwhile, decoherence is regarded as of the main obstacles for QA. Here,
we present examples showing that non-stoaquastic Hamiltonians can lead to
catastrophic failure of QA, whereas a certain decoherence process can be used
to avoid such failure. More specifically, when we include anti-ferromagnetic
interactions (i.e., typical non-stoquastic terms) in the Hamiltonian, we are
unable to prepare the target ground state even with an infinitely long
annealing time for some specific cases. In our example, owing to a symmetry,
the Hamiltonian is block-diagonalized, and a crossing occurs during the QA,
which leads to a complete failure of the ground-state search. Moreover, we show
that, when we add a certain type of decoherence, we can obtain the ground state
after QA for these cases. This is because, even when symmetry exists in
isolated quantum systems, the environment breaks the symmetry. Our counter
intuitive results provide a deep insight into the fundamental mechanism of QA.

core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) to determine their nucleosynthesis or ejecta
and remnant properties. Recently, their use in spherically symmetric (1D)
hydrodynamic simulations led to the result that {56,57}Ni and 44Ti are
massively underproduced compared to observational estimates for Supernova
1987A, if the explosions are slow, i.e., if the explosion mechanism of CCSNe
releases the explosion energy on long timescales. It was concluded that rapid
explosions are required to match observed abundances, i.e., the explosion
mechanism must provide the CCSN energy nearly instantaneously on timescales of
some ten to order 100 ms. This result, if valid, would disfavor the
neutrino-heating mechanism, which releases the CCSN energy on timescales of
seconds. Here, we demonstrate by 1D hydrodynamic simulations and
nucleosynthetic post-processing that these conclusions are a consequence of
disregarding the initial collapse of the stellar core in the thermal-bomb
modelling before the bomb releases the explosion energy. We demonstrate that
the anti-correlation of 56Ni yield and energy-injection timescale vanishes when
the initial collapse is included and that it can even be reversed, i.e., more
56Ni is made by slower explosions, when the collapse proceeds to small radii
similar to those where neutrino heating takes place in CCSNe. We also show that
the 56Ni production in thermal-bomb explosions is sensitive to the chosen mass
cut and that a fixed mass layer or fixed volume for the energy deposition cause
only secondary differences. Moreover, we propose a most appropriate setup for
thermal bombs.

reduces the degrees of freedom, especially in terms of size and weight of any
additional equipment. Hence, in this paper a joint approach of the design of
joint communication, sensing and localization for UAVs is discussed. Towards
this goal, multi-mode multi-port antennas and joint waveform design are
proposed as a part of the solution, when elevating autonomous driving to the

  Subjected to Total Reflection",,,,,"physics.ins-det hep-ex","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The outer water buffer is an economic option to shield the external radiative
backgrounds for liquid-scintillator neutrino detectors. However, the
consequential total reflection of scintillation light at the media boundary
introduces extra complexity to the detector optics. This paper develops a
precise detector-response model by investigating how total reflection
complicates photon propagation and degrades reconstruction. We first
parameterize the detector response by regression, providing an unbiased energy
and vertex reconstruction in the total reflection region while keeping the
number of parameters under control. From the experience of event degeneracy at
the Jinping prototype, we then identify the root cause as the multimodality in
the reconstruction likelihood function, determined by the refractive index of
the buffer, detector scale and PMT coverage. To avoid multimodality, we propose
a straightforward criterion based on the expected photo-electron-count ratios
between neighboring PMTs. The criterion will be used to ensure success in
future liquid-scintillator detectors by guaranteeing the effectiveness of event
reconstruction.

only 10$^{\prime}$ from the south-east side of the well-known Leo Ring, and the
fifth is relatively isolated. HI masses range from 2.6$\times$10$^{6}$ -
9.0$\times$10$^{6}$M$_{\odot}$ and velocity widths (W50) from 16 - 42 km/s.
Although a tidal origin is the most obvious explanation, this formation
mechanism faces several challenges. For the most isolated cloud, the
difficulties are its distance from neighbouring galaxies and the lack of any
signs of disturbance in the HI discs of those systems. Some of the clouds also
appear to follow the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation between mass and velocity
width for normal, stable galaxies which is not expected if they are tidal in
origin. Three clouds are found between M96 and M95 which have no optical
counterparts, but have otherwise similar properties and location to the
optically detected galaxy LeG 13. While overall we favour a tidal debris
scenario to explain the clouds, we cannot rule out a primordial origin. If the
clouds were produced in the same event that gave rise to the Leo Ring, they may
provide important constraints on any model attempting to explain that structure

neutrinos in multi-messenger follow-ups. Recent studies suggest the presence of
a quasi-spherical, optically thick envelope around the supermassive black holes
in TDEs, resulted from stellar debris after the disruption. The envelope may
expand outwardly with a velocity of $\sim 10^4\, {\rm km ^{-1}}$, as indicated
by the emission line widths. We study whether the neutrino signal can be
explained by choked relativistic jets inside the expanding envelope. While
powerful jets, such as that in Swift J1644+57, can successfully break out from
the envelope, those with relatively weak power could be choked by the envelope.
Choked jets can still accelerate cosmic rays and produce high-energy neutrinos
via interaction with the thermal photons in the envelope. We explore the
parameter space of the jets that can produce detectable neutrino flux while
being choked in the expanding envelope. We find that the cumulative neutrino
numbers of AT2019fdr and AT2019aalc are consistent with the expected range
imposed by observations, while the allowed parameter space for AT2019dsg is
small.The neutrino time delay relative to the optical peak time of TDEs can be
explained as the jet propagation time in the envelope before being choked. The
discovery of TDE-associated neutrino events may suggest that jets might have
been commonly formed in TDEs, as expected from super-Eddington accretion, but
most of them are too weak to break out of the expanding envelopes.

time, the predicted labels for each segment then have to be post processed to
detect the actual events. We propose an end-to-end event detection approach

star solution in the Brans-Dicke theory with a positive cosmological constant
$\Lambda$, endowed with a de Sitter or cosmological event horizon in the
asymptotic region, not only there exists no non-trivial field configurations,
but also the inverse Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega^{-1}$ must be vanishing.
This essentially reduces the theory to Einstein's General Relativity. The
assumption of the existence of the cosmological horizon was crucial for this
proof. However, since the Brans-Dicke field $\phi$, couples directly to the
$\Lambda$-term in the energy-momentum tensor as well as $\Lambda$ acts as a
source in $\phi$'s equation of motion, it seems reasonable to ask : can $\phi$
become strong instead and screen the effect of $\Lambda$, at very large scales,
so that the asymptotic de Sitter structure is replaced by some alternative, yet
still acceptable boundary condition? In this work we analytically argue that no
such alternative exists, as long as the spacetime is assumed to be free of any
naked curvature singularity. We further support this result by providing
explicit numerical computations. Thus we conclude that in the presence of a
positive $\Lambda$, irrespective of whether the asymptotic de Sitter boundary
condition is imposed or not, a regular stationary black hole or even a star
solution in the Brans-Dicke theory always necessitates $\omega^{-1}=0$, and
thereby reducing the theory to General Relativity. The qualitative differences
of this result with that of the standard no hair theorems are also pointed out.

spherical polynomials of degree at most $2n$. This paper aims to bypass this
quadrature exactness assumption by replacing it with the Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund
property proposed in a previous paper. Consequently, hyperinterpolation can be
constructed by a positive-weight quadrature rule (not necessarily with
quadrature exactness). This scheme is referred to as unfettered
hyperinterpolation. This paper provides a reasonable error estimate for
unfettered hyperinterpolation. The error estimate generally consists of two
terms: a term representing the error estimate of the original
hyperinterpolation of full quadrature exactness and another introduced as
compensation for the loss of exactness degrees. A guide to controlling the
newly introduced term in practice is provided. In particular, if the quadrature
points form a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) design, then there is a refined error
estimate. Numerical experiments verify the error estimates and the practical
guide.

adversary is able to approximate the inverse of a target machine learning

because inverting a biometric model allows the attacker to produce a realistic
biometric input to spoof biometric authentication systems.
  One of the main constraints in conducting a successful model inversion attack
is the amount of training data required. In this work, we focus on iris and
facial biometric systems and propose a new technique that drastically reduces
the amount of training data necessary. By leveraging the output of multiple
models, we are able to conduct model inversion attacks with 1/10th the training

with alignment loss. Our attacks are black-box, requiring no knowledge of the
weights of the target neural network, only the dimension, and values of the
output vector.
  To show the versatility of the alignment loss, we apply our attack framework
to the task of membership inference (Shokri et al., IEEE S&P 2017) on biometric

function $f(A)$ for a large symmetric positive semi-definite matrix $A$, a task
that arises in, e.g., statistical learning and inverse problems. The
application of popular randomized methods, such as the randomized singular
value decomposition or the Nystr\""om approximation, to $f(A)$ requires
multiplying $f(A)$ with a few random vectors. A significant disadvantage of
such an approach, matrix-vector products with $f(A)$ are considerably more
expensive than matrix-vector products with $A$, even when carried out only
approximately via, e.g., the Lanczos method. In this work, we present and
analyze funNystr\""om, a simple and inexpensive method that constructs a
low-rank approximation of $f(A)$ directly from a Nystr\""om approximation of
$A$, completely bypassing the need for matrix-vector products with $f(A)$. It
is sensible to use funNystr\""om whenever $f$ is monotone and satisfies $f(0) =
0$. Under the stronger assumption that $f$ is operator monotone, which includes
the matrix square root $A^{1/2}$ and the matrix logarithm $\log(I+A)$, we
derive probabilistic bounds for the error in the Frobenius, nuclear, and
operator norms. These bounds confirm the numerical observation that
funNystr\""om tends to return an approximation that compares well with the best
low-rank approximation of $f(A)$. Furthermore, compared to existing methods,
funNystr\""om requires significantly fewer matrix-vector products with $A$ to
obtain a low-rank approximation of $f(A)$, without sacrificing accuracy or
reliability. Our method is also of interest when estimating quantities
associated with $f(A)$, such as the trace or the diagonal entries of $f(A)$. In
particular, we propose and analyze funNystr\""om++, a combination of
funNystr\""om with the recently developed Hutch++ method for trace estimation.

for artificial boundary conditions. Of the many existing artificial boundary
condition schemes, FCD is most similar to an exact nonlocal transparent
boundary condition, but it works directly on Cartesian grids in any dimension,
and runs on top of the fast Fourier transform rather than fast algorithms for
the application of nonlocal history integral operators. We adapt FCD to
time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), and describe a simple
algorithm to smoothly and automatically truncate long-range Coulomb-like
potentials to a time-dependent constant outside of a bounded domain of
interest, so that FCD can be used. This approach eliminates errors originating
from the use of artificial boundary conditions, leaving only the error of the
potential truncation, which is controlled and can be systematically reduced.
The method enables accurate simulations of ultrastrong nonlinear electronic
processes in molecular complexes in which the inteference between bound and
continuum states is of paramount importance. We demonstrate results for
many-electron TDDFT calculations of absorption and strong field photoelectron

results, as compared with the popular method of complex absorbing potentials.

objective is to reach the new configuration in a minimum amount of time; an
important constraint is to keep the swarm connected at all times. Problems of
this type have been considered before, with recent notable results achieving
constant stretch for not necessarily connected reconfiguration: If mapping the
start configuration to the target configuration requires a maximum Manhattan
distance of $d$, the total duration of an overall schedule can be bounded to
$\mathcal{O}(d)$, which is optimal up to constant factors. However, constant
stretch could only be achieved if disconnected reconfiguration is allowed, or
for scaled configurations (which arise by increasing all dimensions of a given
object by the same multiplicative factor) of unlabeled robots.
  We resolve these major open problems by (1) establishing a lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ for connected, labeled reconfiguration and, most
importantly, by (2) proving that for scaled arrangements, constant stretch for
connected reconfiguration can be achieved. In addition, we show that (3) it is
NP-hard to decide whether a makespan of 2 can be achieved, while it is possible
to check in polynomial time whether a makespan of 1 can be achieved.

differentiable MRI system model to enable gradient-based methods for sampling
trajectory optimization. By combining training losses, the algorithm can
simultaneously optimize multiple properties of sampling patterns, including
image quality, hardware constraints (maximum slew rate and gradient strength),
reduced peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), and parameter-weighted contrast.
The proposed method can either optimize the gradient waveform (spline-based
freeform optimization) or optimize properties of given sampling trajectories
(such as the rotation angle of radial trajectories). Notably, the method
optimizes sampling trajectories synergistically with either model-based or
learning-based reconstruction methods. We proposed several strategies to
alleviate the severe non-convexity and huge computation demand posed by the
high-dimensional optimization. The corresponding code is organized as an
open-source, easy-to-use toolbox. We applied the optimized trajectory to
multiple applications including structural and functional imaging. In the
simulation studies, the reconstruction PSNR of a 3D kooshball trajectory was
increased by 4 dB with SNOPY optimization. In the prospective studies, by
optimizing the rotation angles of a stack-of-stars (SOS) trajectory, SNOPY
improved the PSNR by 1.4dB compared to the best empirical method. Optimizing
the gradient waveform of a rotational EPI trajectory improved subjects' rating
of the PNS effect from 'strong' to 'mild.' In short, SNOPY provides an
efficient data-driven and optimization-based method to tailor non-Cartesian

for metamorphic testing of single and more than one drones, respectively. Our

The results indicate that metamorphic testing has great potential in the
autonomous systems domain and should be considered for quality assurance in

empirical result. However, due to the costs of pretraining, most research uses
public models whose pretraining methodology, such as the choice of
tokenization, corpus size, and computational budget, might differ drastically.
When researchers pretrain their own models, they often do so under a
constrained budget, and the resulting models might underperform significantly
compared to SOTA models. These experimental differences led to various
inconsistent conclusions about the nature of the cross-lingual ability of these
models. To help further research on the topic, we released 10 monolingual
byte-level models rigorously pretrained under the same configuration with a
large compute budget (equivalent to 420 days on a V100) and corpora that are 4
times larger than the original BERT's. Because they are tokenizer-free, the
problem of unseen token embeddings is eliminated, thus allowing researchers to
try a wider range of cross-lingual experiments in languages with different

To address them, in this paper, a novel imaging network (AETomo-Net) based on

AETomo-Net performs reconstruction by each azimuth-elevation slice and adds 2D
features extraction and fusion capabilities to the original deep unrolling

richer features and the quality of the imaging results will be improved.

causal connection between a series of onboard visual cues and kinematic actions
that allow for reliable execution of this challenging aerobatic maneuver in
small aerial robots. In this work, we first utilized Deep Reinforcement
Learning and a physics-based simulation to obtain a general, optimal control
policy for robust inverted landing starting from any arbitrary approach
condition. This optimized control policy provides a computationally-efficient
mapping from the system's observational space to its motor command action
space, including both triggering and control of rotational maneuvers. This was
done by training the system over a large range of approach flight velocities
that varied with magnitude and direction.
  Next, we performed a sim-to-real transfer and experimental validation of the
learned policy via domain randomization, by varying the robot's inertial
parameters in the simulation. Through experimental trials, we identified
several dominant factors which greatly improved landing robustness and the
primary mechanisms that determined inverted landing success. We expect the
learning framework developed in this study can be generalized to solve more
challenging tasks, such as utilizing noisy onboard sensory data, landing on
surfaces of various orientations, or landing on dynamically-moving surfaces.

matching interleaved diffusion models (MIDMs). Most existing methods for this
task were formulated as GAN-based matching-then-generation framework. However,
in this framework, matching errors induced by the difficulty of semantic
matching across cross-domain, e.g., sketch and photo, can be easily propagated
to the generation step, which in turn leads to degenerated results. Motivated
by the recent success of diffusion models overcoming the shortcomings of GANs,
we incorporate the diffusion models to overcome these limitations.
Specifically, we formulate a diffusion-based matching-and-generation framework
that interleaves cross-domain matching and diffusion steps in the latent space
by iteratively feeding the intermediate warp into the noising process and
denoising it to generate a translated image. In addition, to improve the
reliability of the diffusion process, we design a confidence-aware process
using cycle-consistency to consider only confident regions during translation.
Experimental results show that our MIDMs generate more plausible images than

particular, the scalar spectral index exhibits an attractor behavior to
$n_{\mathrm{s}}\sim 0.964$, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio can take an

functions. Their electrons have well-defined energy levels and spin properties.
Even more importantly, for a given isotope -- say, $^{12}$C -- all the atoms
are identical. This creates a perfect uniformity that is impossible to achieve
in macroscopic-size quantum systems. However, herding individual atoms is a
very difficult task that requires trapping them with magnetic or optical means
and cooling them down to temperatures in the nanokelvin range. On the other
hand, the counterpart of single atoms -- the single defects -- may be as good
as atom-based quantum systems if not better. These defects, also referred as
quantum defects, possess the favorable energy, spin, and uniformity properties
of single atoms and remain in their place without the help of precisely tuned
lasers. While the number of usable isotopes is set, the combinations of defects
and their host material are practically limitless, giving us the flexibility to
create precisely designed and controlled quantum systems. Furthermore, as we
tame these defects for the quantum world, we bring about transformative
opportunities to the classical world in forms such as ultradense electronic
devices and precise manufacturing. In this research insight, we introduce some
of our recent work on precisely controlled creation and manipulation of
individual defects with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). We also discuss
possible pathways for utilizing these capabilities for the development of novel
systems for Quantum Information Science (QIS) applications such as quantum
information processing and ultrasensitive sensors.

pattern exploiting training (PET), have achieved impressive results in
label-scarce settings. However, they are difficult to employ since they are
subject to high variability from manually crafted prompts, and typically
require billion-parameter language models to achieve high accuracy. To address
these shortcomings, we propose SetFit (Sentence Transformer Fine-tuning), an
efficient and prompt-free framework for few-shot fine-tuning of Sentence
Transformers (ST). SetFit works by first fine-tuning a pretrained ST on a small
number of text pairs, in a contrastive Siamese manner. The resulting model is
then used to generate rich text embeddings, which are used to train a
classification head. This simple framework requires no prompts or verbalizers,
and achieves high accuracy with orders of magnitude less parameters than
existing techniques. Our experiments show that SetFit obtains comparable
results with PEFT and PET techniques, while being an order of magnitude faster
to train. We also show that SetFit can be applied in multilingual settings by
simply switching the ST body. Our code is available at

last decade. In this paper we apply an orthogonal FFT basis as it is used in
OFDM, but subdivide its image into so-called sub-channels and let each
sub-channel take only a fraction of the load. In a random fashion the
subdivision is consecutively applied over a suitable number of time-slots.
Within the time-slots the users will not change their sub-channel assignment
and send in parallel the data. Activity detection is carried out jointly across
time-slots in each of the sub-channels. For such system design we derive three
rather fundamental results: i) First, we prove that the subdivision can be
driven to the extent that the activity in each sub-channel is sparse by design.
An effect that we call sparsity capture effect. ii) Second, we prove that
effectively the system can sustain any overload situation relative to the FFT
dimension, i.e. detection failure of active and non-active users can be kept
below any desired threshold regardless of the number of users. The only price
to pay is delay, i.e. the number of time-slots over which cross-detection is
performed. We achieve this by jointly exploring the effect of measure
concentration in time and frequency and careful system parameter scaling. iii)
Third, we prove that parallel to activity detection active users can carry one
symbol per pilot resource and time-slot so it supports so-called one-shot
messaging.
  The key to proving these results are new concentration results for sequences
of randomly sub-sampled FFTs detecting the sparse vectors ""en bloc"".
Eventually, we show by simulations that the system is scalable resulting in a
coarsely 30-fold capacity increase compared to standard OFDM.

to adapt to a new domain where the acoustics is impacted, which can be simply
due to a change of speaker, microphone, or environment. In addition, this
normalisation step is usually a rather rudimentary method that has certain
limitations, such as being highly susceptible to the amount of data available

for better agreement with galaxy clustering constraints, the spiral

density-$\lambda$ correlation; and we observe intrinsically-large spirals to
cluster more strongly than small spirals over scales

to a given KG schema, namely a domain ontology, and construct the entities and
properties according to the ontology. However, the automatic generation of such
ontology is demanding and existing solutions are often not satisfactory. An
important challenge is a trade-off between two principles of ontology
engineering: knowledge-orientation and data-orientation. The former one
prescribes that an ontology should model the general knowledge of a domain,
while the latter one emphasises on reflecting the data specificities to ensure
good usability. We address this challenge by our method of ontology reshaping,
which automates the process of converting a given domain ontology to a smaller
ontology that serves as the KG schema. The domain ontology can be designed to
be knowledge-oriented and the KG schema covers the data specificities. In
addition, our approach allows the option of including user preferences in the
loop. We demonstrate our on-going research on ontology reshaping and present an
evaluation using real industrial data, with promising results.

ergotropy measures the amount of work extractable under cyclic Hamiltonian

the origin of the asymmetric peaks for the spectral function. Remarkably, the

upcoming LSST survey is expected to discover $10^3-10^4$ lensed QSOs, a large
fraction will remain unresolved due to seeing. The stochastic nature of the
quasar intrinsic flux makes it challenging to identify lensed ones and measure
the time delays using unresolved light curve data only. In this regard, Bag et
al (2022) introduced a data-driven technique based on the minimization of the
fluctuation in the reconstructed image light curves. In this article, we delve
deeper into the mathematical foundation of this approach. We show that the
lensing signal in the fluctuation curve is dominated by the auto-correlation
function (ACF) of the derivative of the joint light curve. This explains why
the fluctuation curve enables the detection of the lensed QSOs only using the
joint light curve, without making assumptions about QSO flux variability, nor
requiring any additional information. We show that the ACF of the derivative of
the joint light curve is more reliable than the ACF of the joint light curve
itself because intrinsic quasar flux variability shows significant
auto-correlation up to a few hundred days (as they follow a red power
spectrum). In addition, we show that the minimization of fluctuation approach
provides even better precision and recall as compared to the ACF of the
derivative of the joint light curve when the data have significant
observational noise.

The phase delays imparted by each plane are determined by the process of

  In this paper, we present a method of online training a DRL agent to drive
autonomously on a physical vehicle by using a model-based safety supervisor.
Our solution uses a supervisory system to check if the action selected by the
agent is safe or unsafe and ensure that a safe action is always implemented on
the vehicle. With this, we can bypass the sim-to-real problem while training
the DRL algorithm safely, quickly, and efficiently. We provide a variety of

moderate intralayer exchange coupling of $J/k_\mathrm{B} = 6.8$ K, the
application of laboratory magnetic fields induces a substantial $XY$ anisotropy
of the spin correlations. Crucially, this provides a significant BKT regime, as
the tiny interlayer exchange $J^\prime / k_\mathrm{B} \approx 1$ mK only
induces 3D correlations upon close approach to the BKT transition with its
exponential growth in the spin-correlation length. We employ nuclear magnetic

determine the critical temperatures of the BKT transition as well as that of
the onset of long-range order. Further, we perform stochastic series expansion
quantum Monte Carlo simulations based on the experimentally determined model

extraction, while suitable operating constraints should be guaranteed such that
WT components are protected from failures. Control strategies can be also
devised to reduce the generated power, for instance to track a power reference
provided by the grid operator. They are called down-regulation strategies and
allow to balance power generation and grid loads, as well as to provide
ancillary grid services, such as frequency regulation. Although this balance is
limited by the wind availability and grid demand, the quality of wind energy
can be improved by introducing down-regulation strategies that make use of the
kinetic energy of the turbine dynamics. This paper shows how the kinetic energy
in the rotating components of turbines can be used as an additional
degree-of-freedom by different down-regulation strategies. In particular we
explore the power tracking problem based on convex model predictive control
(MPC) at a single wind turbine. The use of MPC allows us to introduce a further
constraint that guarantees flow stability and avoids stall conditions.
Simulation results are used to illustrate the performance of the developed
down-regulation strategies. Notably, by maximizing rotor speeds, and thus
kinetic energy, the turbine can still temporarily guarantee tracking of a given
power reference even when occasional saturation of the available wind power
occurs. In the study case we proved that our approach can guarantee power
tracking in saturated conditions for 10 times longer than with traditional
down-regulation strategies.

signals may considerably degrade before reaching the receiver. The reliability
of the transmitted signals, therefore, may be critically problematic due to
blockages between the communicating nodes. Thanks to the ability of
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) to reflect the incident signals with
different reflection angles, this may counter the blockage effect by optimally
reflecting the transmit signals to receiving nodes, hence, improving the
wireless network's performance. With this motivation, this paper formulates a
RIS-aided wireless communication problem from a base station (BS) to a mobile
user equipment (UE). The BS is equipped with an RGB camera. We use the RGB
camera at the BS and the RIS panel to improve the system's performance while
considering signal propagating through multiple paths and the Doppler spread
for the mobile UE. First, the RGB camera is used to detect the presence of the
UE with no blockage. When unsuccessful, the RIS-assisted gain takes over and is
then used to detect if the UE is either ""present but blocked"" or ""absent"". The
problem is determined as a ternary classification problem with the goal of
maximizing the probability of UE communication blockage detection. We find the
optimal solution for the probability of predicting the blockage status for a
given RGB image and RIS-assisted data rate using a deep neural learning model.
We employ the residual network 18-layer neural network model to find this
optimal probability of blockage prediction. Extensive simulation results reveal
that our proposed RIS panel-assisted model enhances the accuracy of
maximization of the blockage prediction probability problem by over 38\%
compared to the baseline scheme.

select the active relay for further re-transmission. Due to fast fading

navigate within the physical world. Gathering data for RL is known to be a
laborious task, and real-world experiments can be risky. Simulators facilitate
the collection of training data in a quicker and more cost-effective manner.
However, RL frequently requires a significant number of simulation steps for an
agent to become skilful at simple tasks. This is a prevalent issue within the
field of RL-based visual quadrotor navigation where state dimensions are
typically very large and dynamic models are complex. Furthermore, rendering
images and obtaining physical properties of the agent can be computationally
expensive. To solve this, we present a simulation framework, built on AirSim,
which provides efficient parallel training. Building on this framework, Ape-X
is modified to incorporate decentralised training of AirSim environments to
make use of numerous networked computers. Through experiments we were able to
achieve a reduction in training time from 3.9 hours to 11 minutes using the
aforementioned framework and a total of 74 agents and two networked computers.

Our knowledge of populations and occurrence of planets orbiting
evolved intermediate-mass stars is still incomplete. In 2010 we started a
planet-search program among 95 giant stars observed by the Kepler mission to
increase the sample of giant stars with planets and with reliable estimates of
stellar masses and radii. Aims. We present the two systems KIC 3526061 and HD
187878 from our planet-search program for which we could characterise their
companions. Methods. We used precise stellar radial velocity measurements taken
with four different echelle spectrographs to derive an orbital solution. We
used Gaia astrometric measurements to obtain the inclination of the HD 187878
system and Kepler photometric observations to estimate the stellar mass and
radius. Results. We report the discovery of a sub-stellar and a stellar
companion around two intermediate-mass red giant branch stars. KIC 3526061 b is
most likely a brown dwarf with a minimum mass of 18.15 Jupiter masses in a
long-period eccentric orbit, with the orbital period 3552 d and orbital
eccentricity 0.85. It is the most evolved system found having a sub-stellar
companion with such a large eccentricity and wide separation. HD 187878 B has a
minimum mass of 78.4 Jupiter masses. Combining the spectroscopic orbital
parameters with the astrometric proper motion anomaly we derived an orbital
inclination 9.8 deg, which corresponds to the companion's mass in the stellar
regime of 0.51 Sun mass. Conclusions. A sub-stellar companion of KIC 3526061
extends the sample of known red giant branch stars with sub-stellar companions
on very eccentric wide orbits and might provide a probe of the dynamical
evolution of such systems over time.

health information needs. Thus identifying inconsistent or conflicting textual
health information has become a safety-critical task. Health advice data poses
a unique challenge where information that is accurate in the context of one
diagnosis can be conflicting in the context of another. For example, people
suffering from diabetes and hypertension often receive conflicting health
advice on diet. This motivates the need for technologies which can provide
contextualized, user-specific health advice. A crucial step towards
contextualized advice is the ability to compare health advice statements and
detect if and how they are conflicting. This is the task of health conflict
detection (HCD). Given two pieces of health advice, the goal of HCD is to
detect and categorize the type of conflict. It is a challenging task, as (i)
automatically identifying and categorizing conflicts requires a deeper
understanding of the semantics of the text, and (ii) the amount of available
data is quite limited.
  In this study, we are the first to explore HCD in the context of pre-trained
language models. We find that DeBERTa-v3 performs best with a mean F1 score of
0.68 across all experiments. We additionally investigate the challenges posed
by different conflict types and how synthetic data improves a model's

difficulty in collecting real health conflicts and propose a human-in-the-loop

application of the method without the need of explicit calculations.
  We have developed all of these techniques with fully differential NNLO QED
calculations in mind and have successfully applied them to many processes such

drivers of these developments has been the MUonE experiment requiring a
high-precision theory prediction for muon-electron ($\mu$-$e$) scattering at
the level of $10\, \text{ppm}$. The multi-scale nature of $\mu$-$e$ scattering
makes this process particularly challenging from a technical point of view.
Only the combined application of FKS$^\ell$, massification, and next-to-soft
stabilisation makes the corresponding calculation possible. This thesis
therefore presents for the first time the fully differential calculation of the
complete set of NNLO corrections to $\mu$-$e$ scattering. This represents a
major step towards the ambitious $10\, \text{ppm}$ target precision of the

The generator encodes the magnitude and complex spectrogram information using

'agents' connected over a dynamic communication network. Their prediction
algorithms are considered as 'experts' giving their look-ahead predictions of
the target's trajectory. In this paper, a novel Decentralized Distributed
Expert-Assisted Learning (D2EAL) algorithm is proposed, which improves the
overall tracking performance by enabling each robot to improve its look-ahead
prediction of the target's trajectory by its information sharing, and running a
weighted information fusion process combined with online learning of weights
based on a prediction loss metric. Theoretical analysis of D2EAL is carried
out, which involves the analysis of worst-case bounds on cumulative prediction
loss, and weights convergence analysis. Simulation studies show that in adverse
scenarios involving large dynamic bias or drift in the expert predictions,
D2EAL outperforms well-known covariance-based estimate/prediction fusion
methods, both in terms of prediction performance and scalability.

However, state-of-the-art studies used to build the FCN using a single brain
parcellation atlas at a certain spatial scale, which largely neglected
functional interactions across different spatial scales in hierarchical
manners. In this study, we propose a novel framework to perform multiscale FCN
analysis for brain disorder diagnosis. We first use a set of well-defined
multiscale atlases to compute multiscale FCNs. Then, we utilize biologically
meaningful brain hierarchical relationships among the regions in multiscale
atlases to perform nodal pooling across multiple spatial scales, namely
""Atlas-guided Pooling"". Accordingly, we propose a Multiscale-Atlases-based
Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network (MAHGCN), built on the stacked layers
of graph convolution and the atlas-guided pooling, for a comprehensive
extraction of diagnostic information from multiscale FCNs. Experiments on
neuroimaging data from 1792 subjects demonstrate the effectiveness of our

training, which typically exhibit high sparsity, i.e., most user-item pairs are
unobserved missing data. A standard choice is treating the missing data as
negative training samples and estimating interaction likelihood between
user-item pairs along with the observed interactions. In this way, some
potential interactions are inevitably mislabeled during training, which will
hurt the model fidelity, hindering the model to recall the mislabeled items,
especially the long-tail ones. In this work, we investigate the mislabeling
issue from a new perspective of aleatoric uncertainty, which describes the
inherent randomness of missing data. The randomness pushes us to go beyond
merely the interaction likelihood and embrace aleatoric uncertainty modeling.
Towards this end, we propose a new Aleatoric Uncertainty-aware Recommendation
(AUR) framework that consists of a new uncertainty estimator along with a
normal recommender model. According to the theory of aleatoric uncertainty, we
derive a new recommendation objective to learn the estimator. As the chance of
mislabeling reflects the potential of a pair, AUR makes recommendations
according to the uncertainty, which is demonstrated to improve the
recommendation performance of less popular items without sacrificing the
overall performance. We instantiate AUR on three representative recommender
models: Matrix Factorization (MF), LightGCN, and VAE from mainstream model
architectures. Extensive results on two real-world datasets validate the
effectiveness of AUR w.r.t. better recommendation results, especially on

event-driven processing can efficiently handle such asynchronous data, while
neuron models such as the leaky-integrate and fire (LIF) can keep track of the
quintessential timing information contained in the inputs. SNNs achieve this by
maintaining a dynamic state in the neuron memory, retaining important
information while forgetting redundant data over time. Thus, we posit that SNNs
would allow for better performance on sequential regression tasks compared to
similarly sized Analog Neural Networks (ANNs). However, deep SNNs are difficult
to train due to vanishing spikes at later layers. To that effect, we propose an
adaptive fully-spiking framework with learnable neuronal dynamics to alleviate
the spike vanishing problem. We utilize surrogate gradient-based

Experiments show that PiFold could achieve 51.66\% recovery on CATH 4.2, while
the inference speed is 70 times faster than the autoregressive competitors. In
addition, PiFold achieves 58.72\% and 60.42\% recovery scores on TS50 and

the heavy elements such as platinum and uranium. The r-process hypothesis is
generally supported as the process through which heavy elements are formed via
explosive rapid neutron capture. Many of the nuclei involved in heavy-element
synthesis are unidentified, short-lived, neutron-rich nuclei, and experimental
data on their masses, half-lives, excited states, decay modes, and reaction
rates with neutron etc., are incredibly scarce. The ultimate goal is to
understand the origin of uranium. The nuclei along the pathway to uranium in
the r-process are in ""Terra Incognita"". In principle, as many of these nuclides
have more neutrons than 238U, this region is inaccessible via the in-flight
fragmentation reactions and in-flight fission reactions used at the present
major facilities worldwide. Therefore, the multi-nucleon transfer (MNT)
reaction, which has been studied at the KEK Isotope Separation System (KISS),
is attracting attention. However, in contrast to in-flight fission and
fragmentation, the nuclei produced by the MNT reaction have characteristic
kinematics with broad angular distribution and relatively low energies which
makes them non-amenable to in-flight separation techniques. KISS-II would be
the first facility to effectively connect production, separation, and analysis
of nuclides along the r-process path leading to uranium. This will be
accomplished by the use of a large solenoid to collect MNT products while
rejecting the intense primary beam, a large helium gas catcher to thermalize
the MNT products, and an MRTOF mass spectrograph to perform mass analysis and
isobaric purification of subsequent spectroscopic studies. The facility will
finally allow us to explore the neutron-rich nuclides in this Terra Incognita.

deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically recognize sferic
signals from redundantly recorded data in a long time range and use them to
compensate for the resistivity estimation. We train the CNN by using field time
series data with different signal to noise rations that were acquired from
different regions in mainland China. To solve the potential overfitting problem
due to the limited number of sferic labels, we propose a training strategy that
randomly generates training samples (with random data augmentations) while
optimizing the CNN model parameters. We stop the training process and data
generation until the training loss converges. In addition, we use a weighted
binary cross-entropy loss function to solve the sample imbalance problem to
better optimize the network, use multiple reasonable metrics to evaluate
network performance, and carry out ablation experiments to optimally choose the
model hyperparameters. Extensive field data applications show that our trained
CNN can robustly recognize sferic signals from noisy time series for subsequent
impedance estimation. The subsequent processing results show that our method
can significantly improve S/N and effectively solve the problem of lack of
energy in dead band. Compared to the traditional processing method without
sferic compensation, our method can generate a smoother and more reasonable
apparent resistivity-phase curves and depolarized phase tensor, correct the
estimation error of sudden drop of high-frequency apparent resistivity and
abnormal behavior of phase reversal, and finally better restore the real
shallow subsurface resistivity structure.

positioning solutions are developed to provide reliable position information in
environments where traditionally used satellite-based positioning systems
cannot provide access to accurate position estimates. Indoor positioning
systems can be based on many technologies; however, radio networks and more
precisely Wi-Fi networks seem to attract the attention of a majority of the
research teams. The most widely used localization approach used in Wi-Fi-based
systems is based on fingerprinting framework. Fingerprinting algorithms,
however, require a radio map for position estimation. This paper will describe
a solution for dynamic radio map creation, which is aimed to reduce the time
required to build a radio map. The proposed solution is using measurements from
IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units), which are processed with a particle filter
dead reckoning algorithm. Reference points (RPs) generated by the implemented
dead reckoning algorithm are then processed by the proposed reference point
merging algorithm, in order to optimize the radio map size and merge similar
RPs. The proposed solution was tested in a real-world environment and evaluated
by the implementation of deterministic fingerprinting positioning algorithms,
and the achieved results were compared with results achieved with a static
radio map. The achieved results presented in the paper show that positioning
algorithms achieved similar accuracy even with a dynamic map with a low density
of reference points.

  with Precise Annotations",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Obstacle detection is a fundamental capability of an autonomous maritime
surface vessel (AMSV). State-of-the-art obstacle detection algorithms are based
on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While CNNs provide higher detection
accuracy and fast detection speed, they require enormous amounts of data for
their training. In particular, the availability of domain-specific datasets is
a challenge for obstacle detection. The difficulty in conducting onsite
experiments limits the collection of maritime datasets. Owing to the logistic
cost of conducting on-site operations, simulation tools provide a safe and
cost-efficient alternative for data collection. In this work, we introduce
SimuShips, a publicly available simulation-based dataset for maritime
environments. Our dataset consists of 9471 high-resolution (1920x1080) images
which include a wide range of obstacle types, atmospheric and illumination
conditions along with occlusion, scale and visible proportion variations. We
provide annotations in the form of bounding boxes. In addition, we conduct
experiments with YOLOv5 to test the viability of simulation data. Our
experiments indicate that the combination of real and simulated images improves
the recall for all classes by 2.9%.
