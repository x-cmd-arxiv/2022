cognitive theory on event perception. We applied such techniques for sampling
coding units from a set of recordings of social interactions rich in behaviors
related to cohesion. Then, we compared the cohesion scores the observers

to suitable ratings and that the technique inspired to cognitive theories leads
to scores reflecting variability in cohesion better than the other ones.

  landscapes","30 pages, 16 figures",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Peatlands account for 10% of UK land area, 80% of which are degraded to some
degree, emitting carbon at a similar magnitude to oil refineries or landfill
sites. A lack of tools for rapid and reliable assessment of peatland condition
has limited monitoring of vast areas of peatland and prevented targeting areas
urgently needing action to halt further degradation. Measured using
interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), peatland surface motion is
highly indicative of peatland condition, largely driven by the eco-hydrological
change in the peatland causing swelling and shrinking of the peat substrate.
The computational intensity of recent methods using InSAR time series to
capture the annual functional structure of peatland surface motion becomes
increasingly challenging as the sample size increases. Instead, we utilize the
behavior of the entire peatland surface motion time series using object
oriented data analysis to assess peatland condition. In a Gibbs sampling
scheme, our cluster analysis based on the functional behavior of the surface
motion time series finds features representative of soft/wet peatlands,
drier/shrubby peatlands and thin/modified peatlands align with the clusters.
The posterior distribution of the assigned peatland types enables the scale of
peatland degradation to be assessed, which will guide future cost-effective
decisions for peatland restoration.

weak supervision. However, in real-world datasets, CLL encounters
class-imbalanced training samples, where the quantity of samples of one class
is significantly lower than those of other classes. Unfortunately, existing CLL
approaches have yet to explore the problem of class-imbalanced samples, which
reduces the prediction accuracy, especially in imbalanced classes. In this
paper, we propose a novel problem setting to allow learning from
class-imbalanced complementarily labeled samples for multi-class

CLL approach, called Weighted Complementary-Label Learning (WCLL). The proposed
method models a weighted empirical risk minimization loss by utilizing the
class-imbalanced complementarily labeled information, which is also applicable
to multi-class imbalanced training samples. Furthermore, the estimation error

Finally, we do extensive experiments on widely-used benchmark datasets to

decoupling strategy is conceptually very different from the 3-flavour QCD
step-scaling method, and so are their systematic errors. These include the
uncertainties of the combined decoupling and continuum limits, which we discuss

defects generated in nano-crystals during the cascade simulations was less than

interstitial atoms in the grain boundary network during the cascade
simulations, while vacancies migrated to the boundaries in a much longer time

self-healing behavior where the number and size of the defects are drastically

from clusters of vacancies' collective behavior, which are much more stable

measurable functions and their quality is oftentimes captured by the membership
to a certain function space. One of the core questions for an analysis of a

optimality of the obtained results deserves a special focus. It requires a
careful choice of families of function spaces balancing between their
expressivity, i.e. the ability to capture fine properties of the model, and
their accessibility, i.e. its technical difficulty for practical use. This
paper presents a unified and general approach to optimality problems in Orlicz
spaces. Orlicz spaces are parametrized by a single convex function and neatly
balance the expressivity and accessibility. We prove a general principle that
yields an easily verifiable necessary and sufficient condition for the
existence or the non-existence of an optimal Orlicz space in various tasks. We
demonstrate its use in specific problems, including the continuity of Sobolev

environments, augmented with morphological perturbations. Learning to locomote
when the length and the thickness of different body parts vary is challenging,
as the control policy is required to adapt to the morphology to successfully
balance and advance the agent. We show that a control policy based on the
proprioceptive state performs poorly with highly variable body configurations,
while an (oracle) agent with access to a learned encoding of the perturbation
performs significantly better. We introduce DMAP, a biologically-inspired,
attention-based policy network architecture. DMAP combines independent
proprioceptive processing, a distributed policy with individual controllers for
each joint, and an attention mechanism, to dynamically gate sensory information
from different body parts to different controllers. Despite not having access
to the (hidden) morphology information, DMAP can be trained end-to-end in all
the considered environments, overall matching or surpassing the performance of
an oracle agent. Thus DMAP, implementing principles from biological motor
control, provides a strong inductive bias for learning challenging sensorimotor
tasks. Overall, our work corroborates the power of these principles in
challenging locomotion tasks.

explain that the situation is fundamentally different. In gravity, axion is a
matter of consistency imposed by the $S$-matrix: Each gauge sector must include
axion with exact relaxation of the corresponding $\bar{\theta}$. We show that
this favors an alternative and remarkably simple formulation of the axion,
fully fixed by the gauge redundancy of QCD, without involvement of a global
symmetry. The axion mechanism is a Higgs effect for the QCD $3$-form, ensuring
that physics is independent of $\bar{\theta}$ to all orders in operator

1080 high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations run with the
Graphics Processing Unit-accelerated code {\sc Cholla} to study the evolution
of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest under a wide range of physically-motivated gas
thermal histories along with different free-streaming lengths of WDM thermal
relics in the early Universe. A statistical comparison of synthetic data with
the forest FPS measured down to the smallest velocity scales ever probed at
redshifts $4.0\lesssim z\lesssim 5.2$ (Boera et al. 2019) yields a lower limit
$m_{\rm WDM}>3.1$ keV (95 percent CL) for the WDM particle mass and constrains
the amplitude and spectrum of the photoheating and photoionizing background
produced by star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei at these
redshifts. Interestingly, our Bayesian inference analysis appears to weakly
favor WDM models with a best-fit thermal relic mass of $m_{\rm
WDM}=4.5_{-1.4}^{+45}$ keV (95 percent CL). We find that the suppression of the
FPS from free-streaming saturates at $k\gtrsim 0.1\,$s km$^{-1}$ because of
peculiar velocity smearing, and this saturated suppression combined with a
slightly lower gas temperature provides a moderately better fit to the observed
small-scale FPS for WDM cosmologies.

a new performance metric called $\alpha$-augmented regret. In this new metric,
the performance of the online policy is compared with an unrestricted offline

amplifying the two distinct sets of modes that appear in a linearized
Navier-Stokes based model for compressible turbulent boundary layer flows.
These two sets of modes are: (i) the subsonic modes that have equivalents in
the incompressible flow regime, and (ii) the supersonic modes that do not have
such equivalents in the incompressible flow regime. The resolvent analysis
framework is used to analyze the linear model, where the non-linear terms of
the equations are taken to be a forcing to the linear terms. The most sensitive
forcing and correspondingly the most amplified response are then analyzed. We
find that, when considering the subsonic response modes, only the solenoidal
component of the forcing to the momentum equations can amplify these modes.
This is consistent with observations in the literature regarding incompressible
flows. Next, when considering the supersonic response modes, we find that these
are pressure fluctuations that radiate into the freestream. Within the
freestream, these modes closely follow the trends of the inviscid Mach waves.
There are three different forcing mechanisms that are found to amplify these
modes. First, the forcing to the continuity and energy equations contribute.
Second, the dilatational component of the forcing to the momentum equations has
a significant role. Finally, although less significant for the resolvent
amplification, there is also a contribution from the solenoidal component of
the forcing. Using these identified forcing mechanisms, a decomposition of the
forcing to the compressible resolvent operator, i.e. of the non-linear terms of
the linearized Navier-Stokes equations, is proposed, that can approximately
isolate the subsonic and the supersonic modes in turbulent boundary layers over
adiabatic as well as cooled walls, and for a range of Mach numbers.

objects that can consist of multiple, spatially separated, components.
Astronomers often rely on visual inspection to resolve radio component
association. However, applying visual inspection to all the hundreds of
thousands of well-resolved RLAGNs that appear in the images from the Low
Frequency Array (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) at $144$ MHz, is a
daunting, time-consuming process, even with extensive manpower.
  Using a machine learning approach, we aim to automate the radio component
association of large ($> 15$ arcsec) radio components.
  We turned the association problem into a classification problem and trained
an adapted Fast region-based convolutional neural network to mimic the expert
annotations from the first LoTSS data release. We implemented a rotation data
augmentation to reduce overfitting and simplify the component association by
removing unresolved radio sources that are likely unrelated to the large and
bright radio components that we consider using predictions from an existing
gradient boosting classifier.
  For large ($> 15$ arcsec) and bright ($> 10$ mJy) radio components in the
LoTSS first data release, our model provides the same associations for
$85.3\%\pm0.6$ of the cases as those derived when astronomers perform the
association manually. When the association is done through public crowd-sourced
efforts, a result similar to that of our model is attained.
  Our method is able to efficiently carry out manual radio-component
association for huge radio surveys and can serve as a basis for either
automated radio morphology classification or automated optical host
identification. This opens up an avenue to study the completeness and
reliability of samples of radio sources with extended, complex morphologies.

in finite samples), yet highly flexible, two-sample testing in the setting of
univariate random variables. Their flexibility derives from a choice of weights
that can be adapted to any given (simple) alternative hypothesis to achieve
efficiency in case of correct specification of said alternative, while their
non-parametric nature guarantees well-calibrated $p$-values even under
misspecification. By drawing connections to (generalized) maximum likelihood
estimation, and exploiting recent work on ranks in multiple dimensions, we
extend linear rank statistics both to multivariate random variables and
composite alternatives. Doing so yields non-parametric, multivariate two-sample
tests that mirror efficiency properties of likelihood ratio tests, while
remaining robust against model misspecification. We prove non-parametric
versions of the classical Wald and score tests facilitating hypothesis testing
in the asymptotic regime, and relate these generalized linear rank statistics
to linear spacing statistics enabling exact $p$-value computations in the small

of likelihood ratios affords applications beyond fully efficient two-sample

alternatives, simultaneous detection of location and scale shifts, and
$K$-sample testing.

months. There is heterogeneity among individuals belonging to an account in
seeking information and hence the seller needs to score the interest of each
individual over a long horizon to decide which individuals must be reached and
when. Moreover, the buy decision rests with the account and must be scored to
project the likelihood of purchase, a decision that is subject to change all
the way up to the actual decision, emblematic of group decision making. We
score decision of the account and its individuals in a dynamic manner. Dynamic

communication channel has a random delay. We consider a slotted-time system
where a transmitter observes a Markovian source and makes decisions based on
the system status. In each time slot, the transmitter decides whether to
preempt or skip when the channel is busy. When the channel is idle, the
transmitter decides whether to send a new update. A remote receiver estimates
the state of the Markovian source based on the update it receives. We consider
a generic transmission delay and assume that the transmission delay is
independent and identically distributed for each update. This paper aims to
optimize the transmitter's decision in each time slot to minimize the AoII with
generic time penalty functions. To this end, we first use the Markov decision
process to formulate the optimization problem and derive the analytical
expressions of the expected AoIIs achieved by two canonical preemptive
policies. Then, we prove the existence of the optimal policy and provide a
feasible value iteration algorithm to approximate the optimal policy. However,
the value iteration algorithm will be computationally expensive if we want
considerable confidence in the approximation. Therefore, we analyze the system
characteristics under two canonical delay distributions and theoretically
obtain the corresponding optimal policies using the policy improvement theorem.
Finally, numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance
improvements brought about by the preemption capability.

how the properties of the disc affect the limiting amplitude of the spirals.
Once again, we employ idealized models that each possess a single instability
that we follow until it has run its course. Remarkably, we find a tight
correlation between the growth rate of the mode and its limiting amplitude,
albeit from only six simulations. We show that non-linear orbit deflections
near corotation cause the mode to saturate, and that the more time available in
a slowly-growing mode creates the critical deflections at lower amplitude. We
also find that scattering at the inner Lindblad resonance is insignificant
until after the mode has saturated. Our objective in this series of papers,

hot-Jupiter planets. We detected 4 Am stars in our sample (KELT-19A, KELT-17,
HATS-70 and TOI-503) and 2 possible Am stars (TOI-681 and HAT-P-69). In
particular, we detected the new Am star HATS-70 which hosts a hot-brown dwarf,
and rule out this class for the hot-Jupiter host WASP-189, both showing
different composition than previously reported. We estimated the incidence of
Am stars within stars hosting hot-brown dwarfs (50-75%) and within stars
hosting hot-Jupiters (20-42%). The incidence of Am stars hosting hot-brown
dwarfs resulted higher than the frequency of Am stars in general. This would
imply that the presence of hot-brown dwarfs could play a role in the
development of Am stars and possibly help to mitigate the ""single Am"" problem,
different to the case of hot-Jupiter planets. Notably, these results would also
indicate that the search for hot-brown dwarfs may be benefited by targeting
single Am stars or Am stars in wide binary systems. We encourage the analysis
off additional early-type stars hosting hot-companions in order to improve the
significance of the initial trends found here. [abridged]

environment, one can adapt a model learned in a similar source environment.
However, existing adaptation methods can fail when the target dataset contains
transitions where the dynamics are very different from the source environment.
For example, the source environment dynamics could be of a rope manipulated in
free-space, whereas the target dynamics could involve collisions and
deformation on obstacles. Our key insight is to improve data efficiency by
focusing model adaptation on only the regions where the source and target
dynamics are similar. In the rope example, adapting the free-space dynamics
requires significantly fewer data than adapting the free-space dynamics while
also learning collision dynamics. We propose a new method for adaptation that
is effective in adapting to regions of similar dynamics. Additionally, we
combine this adaptation method with prior work on planning with unreliable
dynamics to make a method for data-efficient online adaptation, called FOCUS.
We first demonstrate that the proposed adaptation method achieves statistically
significantly lower prediction error in regions of similar dynamics on
simulated rope manipulation and plant watering tasks. We then show on a
bimanual rope manipulation task that FOCUS achieves data-efficient online
learning, in simulation and in the real world.

hand-craft feature manner with strong feature learning capability, resulting in
tremendous improvement of conventional tasks. However, deep neural networks
have recently been demonstrated vulnerable to adversarial examples, a kind of
malicious samples crafted by small elaborately designed noise, which mislead
the DNNs to make the wrong decisions while remaining imperceptible to humans.
Adversarial examples can be divided into digital adversarial attacks and
physical adversarial attacks. The digital adversarial attack is mostly
performed in lab environments, focusing on improving the performance of
adversarial attack algorithms. In contrast, the physical adversarial attack
focus on attacking the physical world deployed DNN systems, which is a more
challenging task due to the complex physical environment (i.e., brightness,
occlusion, and so on). Although the discrepancy between digital adversarial and
physical adversarial examples is small, the physical adversarial examples have
a specific design to overcome the effect of the complex physical environment.
In this paper, we review the development of physical adversarial attacks in
DNN-based computer vision tasks, including image recognition tasks, object
detection tasks, and semantic segmentation. For the sake of completeness of the
algorithm evolution, we will briefly introduce the works that do not involve
the physical adversarial attack. We first present a categorization scheme to
summarize the current physical adversarial attacks. Then discuss the advantages
and disadvantages of the existing physical adversarial attacks and focus on the
technique used to maintain the adversarial when applied into physical
environment. Finally, we point out the issues of the current physical
adversarial attacks to be solved and provide promising research directions.

addresses human sustainability by empowering self-sufficient, problem-focused

under the supervision of an HN radiation oncologist. We trained a 3D Dense
Dilated U-Net architecture to predict 3-dimensional dose distributions using
3-fold cross-validation on 90 plans. Model inputs included CT images, target
prescriptions, and contours for targets and organs at risk (OARs). The model's
performance was assessed on the remaining 22 test plans. We then tested the
application of the dose prediction model for automated review of plan quality.
Dose distributions were predicted on 14 clinical plans. The predicted versus
clinical OAR dose metrics were compared to flag OARs with suboptimal normal
tissue sparing using a 2 Gy dose difference or 3% dose-volume threshold. OAR
flags were compared to manual flags by 3 HN radiation oncologists.
  Results: The predicted dose distributions were of comparable quality to the
KBP plans. The differences between the predicted and KBP-planned D1%, D95%, and
D99% across the targets were within -2.53%(SD=1.34%), -0.42%(SD=1.27%), and
-0.12%(SD=1.97%), respectively, and the OAR mean and maximum doses were within
-0.33Gy(SD=1.40Gy) and -0.96Gy(SD=2.08Gy). For the plan quality assessment
study, radiation oncologists flagged 47 OARs for possible plan improvement.
There was high interphysician variability; 83% of physician-flagged OARs were
flagged by only one of 3 physicians. The comparative dose prediction model
flagged 63 OARs, including 30 of 47 physician-flagged OARs.
  Conclusion: Deep learning can predict high-quality dose distributions, which
can be used as comparative dose distributions for automated, individualized
assessment of HN plan quality.

  Quantum Systems","33 pages including appendix",,,,"quant-ph cs.ET math-ph math.MP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Quantum computing can provide speedups in solving many problems as the
evolution of a quantum system is described by a unitary operator in an
exponentially large Hilbert space. Such unitary operators change the phase of
their eigenstates and make quantum algorithms fundamentally different from
their classical counterparts. Based on this unique principle of quantum
computing, we develop a new algorithmic framework ""Quantum phase processing""
that can directly apply arbitrary trigonometric transformations to eigenphases
of a unitary operator. The quantum phase processing circuit is constructed
simply, consisting of single-qubit rotations and controlled-unitaries,
typically using only one ancilla qubit. Besides the capability of phase
transformation, quantum phase processing in particular can extract the
eigen-information of quantum systems by simply measuring the ancilla qubit,
making it naturally compatible with indirect measurement. Quantum phase
processing complements another powerful framework known as quantum singular
value transformation and leads to more intuitive and efficient quantum
algorithms for solving problems that are particularly phase-related. As a
notable application, we propose a new quantum phase estimation algorithm
without quantum Fourier transform, which requires the least ancilla qubits and
matches the best performance so far. We further exploit the power of our QPP
framework by investigating a plethora of applications in Hamiltonian
simulation, entanglement spectroscopy, and quantum entropies estimation,
demonstrating improvements or optimality for almost all cases.

problem of causal inference: for a given ground-truth input text, we never

methods make no use of counterfactual texts, assuming they will be unavailable.
In this paper, we show that robust causal explainability methods can be created
using approximate counterfactuals, which can be written by humans to
approximate a specific counterfactual or simply sampled using metadata-guided
heuristics. The core of our proposal is the Causal Proxy Model (CPM). A CPM
explains a black-box model $\mathcal{N}$ because it is trained to have the same
actual input/output behavior as $\mathcal{N}$ while creating neural
representations that can be intervened upon to simulate the counterfactual
input/output behavior of $\mathcal{N}$. Furthermore, we show that the best CPM
for $\mathcal{N}$ performs comparably to $\mathcal{N}$ in making factual

strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SFQED) in the nonpertubative regime. Here
we report on an original concept to probe strong-field QED by harnessing the
interaction between an electron beam and a solid target. When a high-density,
ultrarelativistic beam impinges onto an even denser plasma, the beam self
fields are reflected at the plasma boundary. In the rest frame of the beam
electrons, these fields can exceed the Schwinger field, leading to strong-field
QED effects such as quantum nonlinear inverse Compton scattering and nonlinear
Breit-Wheeler electron-positron pair creation. We show that such beam-plasma
collisions can produce results similar to beam-beam collisions with the
advantage of a much simpler experimental setup including the automatic overlap
between the beam and the reflected fields. This scenario opens the way to
precision studies of strong-field QED, with measurable clear signatures in

milestone on the path towards laserless studies of nonperturbative SFQED.

  Data Analysis","24 pages, 4 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Quantum algorithms for topological data analysis (TDA) seem to provide an
exponential advantage over the best classical approach while remaining immune
to dequantization procedures and the data-loading problem. In this paper, we
argue that quantum algorithms for TDA run in exponential time for almost all
inputs by showing that (under widely believed complexity-theoretic conjectures)
the central problem of TDA - estimating Betti numbers - is intractable even for
quantum computers. Specifically, we prove that the problem of computing Betti
numbers exactly is \#P-hard, while the problem of approximating Betti numbers
up to multiplicative error is NP-hard. Moreover, both problems retain their
hardness if restricted to the regime where quantum algorithms for TDA perform
best. Because quantum computers are not expected to solve \#P-hard or NP-hard
problems in subexponential time, our results imply that quantum algorithms for
TDA offer only a polynomial advantage. We verify our claim by showing that the
seminal quantum algorithm for TDA developed by Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi
\cite{LloydAlgo} achieves a quadratic speedup over the best classical approach
on average, and a power-of-four speedup in the best case. Finally, we argue
that an exponential quantum advantage can be recovered if the data is given as
a specification of simplices rather than as a list of vertices and edges -- for
example, if we wish to calculate the homology of Facebook from a list of
Facebook groups and their members rather than from a list of pairwise
interactions between Facebook users.

also provide meaningful constraints on the radius and effective temperature of
the star. This additional constraint is especially significant when we properly
account for the 4.2% radius and 2.4% temperature systematic errors inherent in
the stellar evolutionary and atmospheric models. In the typical case, we can
measure stellar radii to 3% and temperatures to 1.75%. In the best real-world
cases, we can infer radii to 1.7% and temperatures to 1.2% -- well below the
systematic floors from stellar models alone -- which can improve the precision
in the planetary parameters by a factor of two. We explain in detail the

longer during the hard-to-intermediate state transition, evolving from
${\lesssim}1~{\rm ms}$ to ${\sim}10~{\rm ms}$. The soft lag production
mechanism is thermal disk reprocessing of non-thermal coronal irradiation.
X-ray reverberation models account for the light-travel time delay external to
the disk, but assume instantaneous reprocessing of the irradiation inside the
electron scattering-dominated disk atmosphere. We model this neglected
scattering time delay as a random walk within an $\alpha$-disk atmosphere, with
approximate opacities. To explain soft lag trends, we consider a limiting case
of the scattering time delay that we dub the thermalization time delay, $t_{\rm
th}$; this is the time for irradiation to scatter its way down to the effective
photosphere, where it gets thermalized, and then scatter its way back out. We
demonstrate that $t_{\rm th}$ plausibly evolves from being inconsequential for
low mass accretion rates $\dot{m}$ characteristic of the hard state, to
rivaling or exceeding the light-travel time delay for $\dot{m}$ characteristic
of the intermediate state. However, our crude model confines $t_{\rm th}$ to a
narrow annulus near peak accretion power dissipation, so cannot yet explain in
detail the anomalously long-duration soft lags associated with larger disk
radii. We call for time-dependent models with accurate opacities to assess the
potential relevance of a scattering delay.

the Standard Model (SM) have strong theoretical motivation and may be relevant
to explaining the abundance of dark matter (DM). An important question for such
sectors is how they connect to the SM. For a dark sector with a new gauge
interaction, a natural connection arises from heavy vector-like fermions
charged under both the visible and dark gauge groups. The gauge charges of such
fermions imply that one or more of them is stable in the absence of additional
sources of dark symmetry breaking. A generic challenge for such connectors is
that they can produce too much dark matter or interact too strongly with nuclei
if they were ever thermalized in the early universe. In this paper we study
this challenge in a simple connector theory consisting of new vector-like
electroweak doublet and singlet fermions that also transform under the
fundamental representation of a new (Abelian) gauge force, and we show that
these connectors in their minimal form are almost always ruled out by existing
direct DM searches. To address this challenge, we investigate two solutions.
First, we study mitigating scattering on nuclei by introducing a Majorana mass
term for the singlet. And second, we investigate a mixing with SM leptons that
allows the connectors to decay while remaining consistent with cosmological
tests and searches for charged lepton flavor violation. Both solutions rely on
the presence of a dark Higgs field with a specific charge.

refer to it as the DM axion. We predominantly explore PBHs in the mass range

abundance of DM axions and the parameter space of PBHs. We numerically solve
the set of Boltzmann equations, that governs the cosmological evolution during
both radiation and PBH-dominated epochs, providing the bulk energy content of
the early Universe. We further solve the equation of motion of the DM axion

mechanisms, light QCD axions are generated from evaporating PBHs through the
Hawking mechanism and could make up a fraction of the dark radiation (DR). If

much larger. In this work we study, via semi-analytical methods, the
propagation of the GRB outflow, its interaction with the external material, and
the ensuing prompt radiation. In particular, we focus on the case in which the
external shock develops early in the evolution, at a radius that is smaller

environments are likely characterized by a single, long emission episode that
is due to the superposition of individual pulses, with a characteristic hard to
soft evolution irrespective of the light curve luminosity. While multi-pulse
light curves are not impossible, they would require the central engine to go
dormant for a long time before re-igniting. In addition, short GRB engines
would produce bursts with prompt duration that would exceed the canonical 2 s

$N$-partite information scales as $I_N \sim r^{-2N\Delta}$, where $r$ is the
typical distance between pairs of regions and $\Delta$ is the lowest primary

completely explicit formula for the $I_4$ in terms of 2-, 3- and 4-point
functions of the lowest-dimensional primary. Then, we consider a
three-dimensional scalar field in the lattice. We verify the predicted
long-distance scaling and provide strong evidence that $I_N$ is always positive
for general regions and arbitrary $N$ for that theory. For the $I_4$, we find
excellent numerical agreement between our general formula and the lattice
result for disk regions. We also perform lattice calculations of the mutual
information for more general regions and general separations both for a free
scalar and a free fermion, and conjecture that, normalized by the corresponding
disk entanglement entropy coefficients, the scalar result is always greater

become a helium supergiant following core helium exhaustion. A tentative
identification of the faint companion in the ultraviolet led to mass estimates
of both components that made the helium star in Upsilon Sagittarii a
prototypical immediate progenitor of a type Ib/c supernova. However, no
consistent model for the complex spectrum has been achieved, casting doubt on
this interpretation. In the present study we provide for the first time a
composite spectral model that fits the ultraviolet data, and clearly identifies
the companion as a rapidly rotating slowly moving ~7Msun B-type star, unlike
previously suggested. The stripped helium supergiant is less luminous than
previous estimates, and, with an estimated mass smaller than 1Msun, is ruled
out as a core-collapse supernova progenitor. We provide a detailed binary
evolution scenario that explains the temperature and luminosity of the two
components as well as the very low gravity (log g ~ 1.0 [cm/s^2]) and extreme
hydrogen deficiency of the primary (atmospheric mass fraction XH ~ 0.001). The
best-fitting model is a ~5Msun intermediate-mass primary with an initial
orbital period of a few days, and a secondary that appears to have gained a
significant amount of mass despite its high rotation. We conclude that Upsilon
Sagittarii is a key system for testing binary evolution processes, especially
envelope stripping and mass accretion.

self-consistent Hartree-Fock method on a particle-hole symmetric model and
allowing translation symmetry breaking terms, we obtain the phase diagram with
respect to the ratio of $AA$ interlayer hopping $(w_0)$ and $AB$ interlayer

($w_0/w_1 \lesssim 0.5$), a quantum anomalous Hall state with Chern number
$\nu_c = \pm 1$ can be observed consistent with previous studies. Around the
realistic value $w_0/w_1 \approx 0.8$, we find a spin and valley polarized,
translation symmetry breaking, state with $C_{2z}T$ symmetry, a charge gap and
a doubling of the moir\'e unit cell, dubbed the $C_{2z}T$ stripe phase. The
real space total charge distribution of this $C_{2z}T$ stripe phase in the flat
band limit does not have modulation between different moir\'e unit cells,
although the charge density in each layer is modulated, and the translation
symmetry is strongly broken. Other symmetries, including $C_{2z}$, $C_{2x}$ and
particle-hole symmetry $P$, and the topology of the $C_{2z}T$ stripe phase are
also discussed in detail. We observed braiding and annihilation of the Dirac
nodes by continuously turning on the order parameter to its fully
self-consistent value, and provide a detailed explanation of the mechanism for
the charge gap opening despite preserving $C_{2z}T$ and valley $U(1)$

and the $C_{2z}T$ stripe phase, we find an additional competing state with

collimated instrument and the spectrum can extend to energies above the Pt

of the optics. We present the first scientific spectral analysis beyond 79 keV
using a Cygnus X-1 observation in StrayCats, the catalog of stray light

simultaneously with an INTEGRAL observation. When the spectra are modeled
together in the 30-120 keV energy band, we find that the NuSTAR stray light

light element abundance measurements from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) has
been shown to constrain the cosmological expansion history to an unprecedented
degree. Using the newest LUNA data and DR16 data from SDSS, the BAO+BBN probe
puts tight constraints on the Hubble parameter ($H_0 = 67.6 \pm 1.0
\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$), resulting in a $3.7\sigma$ tension with the local distance
ladder determination from SH0ES in a $\Lambda$CDM model. In the updated BAO
data the high- and low-redshift subsets are mutually in excellent agreement,
and there is no longer a mild internal tension to artificially enhance the
constraints. Adding the recently-developed ShapeFit analysis yields $H_0 = 68.3
\pm 0.7 \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ ($3.8 \sigma$ tension). For combinations with
additional data sets, there is a strong synergy with the sound horizon
information of the cosmic microwave background, which leads to one of the
tightest constraints to date, $H_0 = 68.30\pm 0.45\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, in
$4.2\sigma$ tension with SH0ES. The region preferred by this combination is
perfectly in agreement with that preferred by ShapeFit. The addition of
supernova data also yields a $4.2\sigma$ tension with SH0ES for Pantheon, and a
$3.5\sigma$ tension for PantheonPLUS. Finally, we show that there is a degree
of model-dependence of the BAO+BBN constraints with respect to early-time
solutions of the Hubble tension, and the loss of constraining power in extended
models depends on whether the model can be additionally constrained from BBN
observations.

The remnants of these fields may take the form of the Prendergast magnetic

expected to stabilize each other. Previous analytic and numerical calculations
did not find any evidence for instability of the Prendergast field over short
timescales. In this paper, we present numerical simulations which show a long
timescale, linear instability of this magnetic field. We find the instability
to be robust to changes in boundary conditions and it is not stabilized by
strong stable stratification. The instability is a resistive instability, and
the growth rate has a power-law dependence on the resistivity, in which the
growth rate decreases as the resistivity decreases. We estimate the growth rate
of the instability in stars by extrapolating this power-law to stellar values
of the resistivity. The instability is sufficiently rapid to destabilize the

decentralized vector flow scheduling to coordinate vector data flow among

reusing between on-chip modules to reduce unnecessary off-chip accesses for
FPGA accelerators. We prototype the accelerator on a Xilinx U280 HBM FPGA. Our

Callipepla achieves a speedup of 3.94x, 3.36x higher throughput, and 2.94x

accurately represent unbalanced low-voltage distribution networks. An algorithm
is developed to solve the resulting Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP)

and complementarity reformulations to obtain discrete designs that are also
feasible with respect to the network constraints. A heuristic modification to
the original algorithm is also proposed to improve computational speed.
Improved formulations for selecting feasible combinations of air source heat
pumps (ASHPs) and hot water storage tanks are also presented. The algorithms
outperform the existing state-of-the-art commercial MINLP solver, which fails
to find any solutions in two instances. While feasible solutions were obtained
for all cases, convergence was not achieved for all, especially for those
involving the larger network. Where converged, the algorithm with the heuristic
modification has achieved results up to 70% faster than the original algorithm.
Results for case studies suggest that including ASHPs can support up to 16%
higher renewable generation capacity compared to gas boilers, albeit with
higher ASHP investment costs. The optimisation framework and results can be
used to inform stakeholders such as policy-makers and network operators, to
increase renewable energy capacity and aid the decarbonisation of domestic

However, its usefulness to many researchers is limited for two reasons. First,
existing approaches are inflexible and do not allow KRLS to be combined with
theoretically-motivated extensions such as random effects, unregularized fixed
effects, or non-Gaussian outcomes. Second, estimation is extremely
computationally intensive for even modestly sized datasets. Our paper addresses
both concerns by introducing generalized KRLS (gKRLS). We note that KRLS can be
re-formulated as a hierarchical model thereby allowing easy inference and
modular model construction where KRLS can be used alongside random effects,
splines, and unregularized fixed effects. Computationally, we also implement
random sketching to dramatically accelerate estimation while incurring a
limited penalty in estimation quality. We demonstrate that gKRLS can be fit on
datasets with tens of thousands of observations in under one minute. Further,
state-of-the-art techniques that require fitting the model over a dozen times

  Main results unchanged",,,,"math.RT math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For a quasi-split connected reductive group $G$ over a local field $F$ we
define a compact abelian group $\tilde\pi_1(G)$ and an extension $1 \to
\tilde\pi_1(G) \to G(F)_\infty \to G(F) \to 1$ of topological groups equipped
with a splitting over $G_\textrm{sc}(F)$. Any character $x : \tilde\pi_1(G) \to
\mu_n(\mathbb{C})$ leads to an $n$-fold cover $G(F)_x$ of $G(F)$ via pushout.
We define an $L$-group $^LG_x$ for this cover that is generally a non-split
extension of $\textrm{Gal}(F^s/F)$ by $\hat G$. We prove a refined local
Langlands correspondence for $G(F)_x$, assuming it is known for connected
reductive groups with the same adjoint group as $G$.
  Motivation for this construction comes from considerations of Langlands'
functoriality conjecture, where subgroups $\mathcal{H} \subset {^LG}$ of the
$L$-group of $G$ arise that need not be $L$-groups of other reductive groups.
If such a subgroup is full and intersects $\hat G$ in a connected reductive
subgroup of maximal rank, we construct a natural triple $(H,x,\xi)$ consisting
of a quasi-split connected reductive group $H$, a double cover $H(F)_x$, and an
$L$-embedding $\xi : {^LH}_x \to {^LG}$ that is an isomorphism onto
$\mathcal{H}$. We expect that genuine representations of $H(F)_x$ transfer
functorially to representations of $G(F)$.
  In the special case of endoscopy, we show that the construction of transfer
factors simplifies when the natural double cover $H(F)_x$ of the endoscopic
group is used. The transfer factor becomes the product of two natural
invariants that do not depend on auxiliary choices. One of them is closely
related to Kottwitz's work on transfer factors for Lie algebras. The other one
is not specific to the case of endoscopy, and will likely play a role in
general functoriality questions. Our work is motivated by work of Adams and
Vogan over the real numbers.

tool, both for theoretical and numerical purposes. On the other hand, for
tensor networks in dimension two or greater there is only limited understanding
of the gauge symmetry. Here we introduce a new canonical form, the minimal
canonical form, which applies to projected entangled pair states (PEPS) in any
dimension, and prove a corresponding fundamental theorem. Already for matrix
product states this gives a new canonical form, while in higher dimensions it
is the first rigorous definition of a canonical form valid for any choice of
tensor. We show that two tensors have the same minimal canonical forms if and
only if they are gauge equivalent up to taking limits; moreover, this is the
case if and only if they give the same quantum state for any geometry. In
particular, this implies that the latter problem is decidable - in contrast to
the well-known undecidability for PEPS on grids. We also provide rigorous
algorithms for computing minimal canonical forms. To achieve this we draw on
geometric invariant theory and recent progress in theoretical computer science

boundedness of the errors occurring due to mismatch between the disturbed

implements the tube-based motion primitives while solving an online

is implemented on an Euler-Lagrange based ship model which is affected by

products or experiences, including flight services provided by commercial
airlines. This study aims to measure customer satisfaction by analyzing
sentiments of Tweets that mention airlines using a machine learning approach.
Relevant Tweets are retrieved from Twitter's API and processed through
tokenization and vectorization. After that, these processed vectors are passed
into a pre-trained machine learning classifier to predict the sentiments. In
addition to sentiment analysis, we also perform lexical analysis on the
collected Tweets to model keywords' frequencies, which provide meaningful
contexts to facilitate the interpretation of sentiments. We then apply time
series methods such as Bollinger Bands to detect abnormalities in sentiment
data. Using historical records from January to July 2022, our approach is
proven to be capable of capturing sudden and significant changes in passengers'
sentiment. This study has the potential to be developed into an application
that can help airlines, along with several other customer-facing businesses,
efficiently detect abrupt changes in customers' sentiments and take adequate
measures to counteract them.

performed under the assumption that the plasma is fully ionized. However, in
the lower solar atmosphere a reduced temperature often results in only the
partial ionization of the plasma. The interaction between the decoupled neutral
and ionized components of such a partially ionized plasma produces ambipolar
diffusion. To investigate the role of ambipolar diffusion in propagating wave
characteristics in the photosphere and chromosphere, we employ the Mancha3D
numerical code to model magnetoacoustic waves propagating through the
atmosphere immediately above the umbra of a sunspot. We solve the non-ideal MHD
equations for data-driven perturbations to the magnetostatic equilibrium and
the effect of ambipolar diffusion is investigated by varying the simulation to
include additional terms in the MHD equations that account for this process.
Analyzing the energy spectral densities for simulations with/without ambipolar
diffusion, we find evidence to suggest that ambipolar diffusion plays a pivotal
role in wave characteristics in the weakly ionized low density regions, hence
maximizing the local ambipolar diffusion coefficient. As a result, we propose
that ambipolar diffusion is an important mechanism that requires careful
consideration into whether it should be included in simulations, and whether it
should be utilized in the analysis and interpretation of particular
observations of the lower solar atmosphere.

spatially-exponential decaying (SED) between nodes in the network. The major
objective is to study whether the optimal controller also enjoys a SED
structure, which is an appealing property for ensuring the optimality of
decentralized control over the network. We start with studying the open-loop
asymptotically stable system and show that the optimal LQR state feedback gain
$K$ is `quasi'-SED in this setting, i.e. $\|[K]_{ij}\|\sim
O\left(e^{-\frac{c}{\mathrm{poly}\ln(N)}}\mathrm{dist}(i,j)\right)$. The
decaying rate $c$ depends on the decaying rate and norms of system matrices and
the open-loop exponential stability constants. Then the result is further
generalized to unstable systems under a SED stabilizability assumption.
Building upon the `quasi'-SED result on $K$, we give an upper-bound on the
performance of $\kappa$-truncated local controllers, suggesting that
distributed controllers can achieve near-optimal performance for SED systems.
We develop these results via studying the structure of another type of
controller, disturbance response control, which has been studied and used in
recent online control literature; thus as a side result, we also prove the
`quasi'-SED property of the optimal disturbance response control, which serves
as a contribution on its own merit.

have analyzed the iris line, modeled approximately as a long open-resonator
structure with thin screens, using methods such as Vainstein's impedance
boundary condition or perturbative mode matching. The aim in those methods was
to seek the eigensolution that represents the dominant (least lossy)
propagation mode in a long iris-line structure at steady state. In this paper,
a forward-traveling wave analysis is presented, wherein a short THz pulse
paraxially traverses the oversized structure cell by cell, including the
transient regime. The iris line's periodic discontinuities are analyzed in
terms of forward-wave orthogonal mode decompositions, which are then used to
build a 'forward-scatter' model (matrix) for each cell. The presented approach
predicts a diffraction loss behavior that agrees with that of the eigensolution

showing transients as they evolve and settle to the dominant mode down the
line, and offers numerical implementation speeds that are typically an

relevant to efficiently measure the vertical cup-to-disc ratio (vCDR), a
biomarker commonly used in ophthalmology to determine the degree of
glaucomatous optic neuropathy. In general this is solved using coarse-to-fine
deep learning algorithms in which a first stage approximates the OD and a
second one uses a crop of this area to predict OD/OC masks. While this approach
is widely applied in the literature, there are no studies analyzing its real
contribution to the results. In this paper we present a comprehensive analysis
of different coarse-to-fine designs for OD/OC segmentation using 5 public
databases, both from a standard segmentation perspective and for estimating the
vCDR for glaucoma assessment. Our analysis shows that these algorithms not
necessarily outperfom standard multi-class single-stage models, especially when
these are learned from sufficiently large and diverse training sets.
Furthermore, we noticed that the coarse stage achieves better OD segmentation
results than the fine one, and that providing OD supervision to the second
stage is essential to ensure accurate OC masks. Moreover, both the single-stage
and two-stage models trained on a multi-dataset setting showed results in pair
or even better than other state-of-the-art alternatives, while ranking first in
REFUGE for OD/OC segmentation. Finally, we evaluated the models for vCDR
prediction in comparison with six ophthalmologists on a subset of AIROGS
images, to understand them in the context of inter-observer variability. We
noticed that vCDR estimates recovered both from single-stage and coarse-to-fine
models can obtain good glaucoma detection results even when they are not highly
correlated with manual measurements from experts.

modeling by using stochastic processes of different types. In this context,
often one is interested in investigating the memory properties of the natural
phenomenon at hand. This is usually accomplished by computing the
autocorrelation function of the numerical series describing the considered
phenomenon. Often, especially when considering real world data, the
autocorrelation function must be computed starting from a single numerical
series: i.e. with a time-average approach. Hereafter, we will propose a novel
way of evaluating the time-average autocorrelation function, based on the
preliminary evaluation of the quantity N({\tau},g{\mu},g{\nu}), that, apart
from normalization factors, represents a numerical estimate, based on a single
realization of the process, of the 2-point joint probability density function
P(x2,{\tau};x1,0). The main advantage of the proposed method is that it allows
to quantitatively assess what is the error that one makes when numerically
evaluating the autocorrelation function due to the fact that any simulated time
series is necessarily bounded. In fact, we show that, for a wide class of
stochastic processes admitting a nonlinear Langevin equation with white noise
and that can be described by using a Fokker-Planck equation, the way the
numerical estimate of the autocorrelation function converges to its theoretical
prediction depends on the pdf tails. Moreover, the knowledge of
N({\tau},g{\mu},g{\nu}) allows to easily compute the process histogram and to
characterize processes with multiple timescales. We will show the effectiveness
of our new methodology by considering three stochastic processes whose
autocorrelation function and two-point probability density function are both
known in an analytical or numerical form, thus allowing direct comparisons.

finetune large pretrained transformer models (e.g., BERT) using smaller

paper introduces a large-scale study of self-pretraining, where the same
(downstream) training data is used for both pretraining and finetuning. In
experiments addressing both ELECTRA and RoBERTa models and 10 distinct
downstream classification datasets, we observe that self-pretraining rivals
standard pretraining on the BookWiki corpus (despite using around
$10\times$--$500\times$ less data), outperforming the latter on $7$ and $5$

often perform well on other tasks, including the GLUE benchmark. Besides
classification tasks, self-pretraining also provides benefits on structured

by pretraining on the BookWiki corpus. Our results hint that in many scenarios,
performance gains attributable to pretraining are driven primarily by the
pretraining objective itself and are not always attributable to the use of

learning over non-IID data. We propose \textit{Neighborhood Gradient Clustering
(NGC)}, a novel decentralized learning algorithm that modifies the local
gradients of each agent using self- and cross-gradient information.
Cross-gradients for a pair of neighboring agents are the derivatives of the
model parameters of an agent with respect to the dataset of the other agent. In
particular, the proposed method replaces the local gradients of the model with
the weighted mean of the self-gradients, model-variant cross-gradients
(derivatives of the neighbors' parameters with respect to the local dataset),
and data-variant cross-gradients (derivatives of the local model with respect
to its neighbors' datasets). The data-variant cross-gradients are aggregated
through an additional communication round without breaking the privacy
constraints. Further, we present \textit{CompNGC}, a compressed version of
\textit{NGC} that reduces the communication overhead by $32 \times$. We
theoretically analyze the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm and
demonstrate its efficiency over non-IID data sampled from {various vision and
language} datasets trained. Our experiments demonstrate that \textit{NGC} and
\textit{CompNGC} outperform (by $0-6\%$) the existing SoTA decentralized
learning algorithm over non-IID data with significantly less compute and memory
requirements. Further, our experiments show that the model-variant
cross-gradient information available locally at each agent can improve the
performance over non-IID data by $1-35\%$ without additional communication
cost.

foam (lungs), glow polyactic acid (bones) and natural polyactic acid (tumours
placed in the lungs). X-ray attenuation properties of all materials prior to
manufacturing were evaluated by means of photon-counting computed tomography
(CT) imaging on a table-top system. Breathing motion was achieved by a
scotch-yoke mechanism with diaphragm motion frequencies of 10 - 20 rpm and
displacements of 1 to 2 cm. Casper was manufactured by means of 3D printing of
moulds and ribs and assembled in a complex process. The final phantom was then
scanned using a clinical CT scanner to evaluate material CT numbers and the
extent of tumour motion. Casper CT numbers were close to human CT numbers for
soft tissue (46 HU), ribs (125 HU), lungs (-840 HU) and tumours (-45 HU). For a
2 cm diaphragm displacement the largest tumour displacement was 0.7 cm. The
five tumour volumes were accurately assessed in the static CT images with a
mean absolute error of 4.3%. Tumour sizes were either underestimated for
smaller tumours or overestimated for larger tumours in dynamic CT images due to
motion blurring with a mean absolute difference from true volumes of 10.3%.

gravitational waves in the adiabatic limit, looking at tensor and scalar
polarizations. In particular, we find that metric tensor modes couple to
torsion tensor components, leading to the appearance, as in the metric version
of Chern-Simons gravity, of birefringence, characterized by different
dispersion relations for the left and right circularized polarization states.
As a result, the purely tensor part of torsion propagates like a wave, while
nonmetricity decouples and behaves like a harmonic oscillator. Finally, we
discuss scalar modes, outlining as they decay exponentially in time and do not
propagate.

leaves the possibility that an appropriate ultraviolet completion of DE

orders of magnitude lower. By implementing a method based on GW multiband

observations can therefore firmly constrain scenarios based on the EFT of DE,

  Computing Migrations",,,,,"cs.NI cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In edge computing, users' service profiles must be migrated in response to
user mobility. Reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks have been proposed to do
so. Nevertheless, these frameworks do not consider occasional server failures,
which although rare, can prevent the smooth and safe functioning of edge
computing users' latency sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and
real-time obstacle detection, because users' computing jobs can no longer be
completed. As these failures occur at a low probability, it is difficult for RL
algorithms, which are inherently data-driven, to learn an optimal service
migration solution for both the typical and rare event scenarios. Therefore, we
introduce a rare events adaptive resilience framework FIRE, which integrates
importance sampling into reinforcement learning to place backup services. We
sample rare events at a rate proportional to their contribution to the value
function, to learn an optimal policy. Our framework balances service migration
trade-offs between delay and migration costs, with the costs of failure and the
costs of backup placement and migration. We propose an importance sampling
based Q-learning algorithm, and prove its boundedness and convergence to
optimality. Following which we propose novel eligibility traces, linear
function approximation and deep Q-learning versions of our algorithm to ensure
it scales to real-world scenarios. We extend our framework to cater to users
with different risk tolerances towards failure. Finally, we use trace driven
experiments to show that our algorithm gives cost reductions in the event of
failures.

means of studying the nuclear strong force and would be the first clear
evidence of baryons transforming into a color-neutral point-like size in the
nucleus as predicted by quantum chromodynamics. Recent C$(e,e'p)$ results from
electron-scattering did not observe the onset of color transparency (CT) in
protons up to spacelike four-momentum transfers squared, $Q^2=14.2$ GeV$^2$.
The traditional methods of searching for CT in $(e,e'p)$ scattering use heavy
targets favoring kinematics with already initially reduced final state
interactions (FSIs) such that any CT effect that further reduces FSIs will be
small. The reasoning behind this choice is the difficulty in accounting for all
FSIs. D$(e,e'p)n$, on the other hand, has well-understood FSI contributions
from double scattering with a known dependence on the kinematics and can show
an increased sensitivity to hadrons in point-like configurations. Double
scattering is the square of the re-scattering amplitude in which the
knocked-out nucleon interacts with the spectator nucleon, a process that is
suppressed in the presence of point-like configurations and is particularly
well-studied for the deuteron. This suppression yields a quadratic sensitivity
to CT effects and is strongly dependent on the choice of kinematics. Here, we
describe a possible JLab electron-scattering experiment that utilizes these
kinematics and explores the potential signal for the onset of CT with enhanced
sensitivity as compared to recent experiments.

characterization of variational quantum circuits using the rank of the
dynamical Lie algebra associated with the hermitian generator(s) of the

calculation of ground-state energies of physical systems are taken as the focus
of this exploration. A promising connection is found between the Lie rank, the
accuracy of calculated energies, and the requisite depth to attain target
states via a given circuit architecture, even when using a lot of parameters
which is appreciably below the number of separate terms in the generators. As
the cost of calculating the dynamical Lie rank via an iterative process grows
exponentially with the number of qubits in the circuit and therefore becomes
prohibitive quickly, reliable approximations thereto are desirable. The
rapidity of the increase of the dynamical Lie rank in the first few iterations
of the calculation is found to be a viable (lower bound) proxy for the full
calculation, balancing accuracy and computational expense. We, therefore,
propose the dynamical Lie rank and proxies thereof as a useful design metric
for layer-structured quantum circuits in variational algorithms.

the sizes of the hot dust continuum and the broad-line region (BLR). We find
that the continuum size measured using optical/near-infrared interferometry
(OI) is roughly twice that measured by reverberation mapping (RM). Both OI and
RM continuum sizes show a tight relation with the H$\beta$ BLR size with only
an intrinsic scatter of 0.25 dex. The masses of supermassive black holes (BHs)
can hence be simply derived from a dust size in combination with a broad line
width and virial factor. Since the primary uncertainty of these BH masses comes
from the virial factor, the accuracy of the continuum-based BH masses is close
to those based on the RM measurement of the broad emission line. Moreover, the
necessary continuum measurements can be obtained on a much shorter timescale
than those required monitoring for RM, and are also more time efficient than
those needed to resolve the BLR with OI. The primary goal of this work is to
demonstrate measuring the BH mass based on the dust continuum size with our
first calibration of the $R_\mathrm{BLR}$-$R_\mathrm{d}$ relation. The current
limitation and caveats are discussed in detail. Future GRAVITY observations are
expected to improve the continuum-based method and have the potential to
measure BH masses for a large sample of AGNs in the low-redshift Universe.

on exciton transport in CsPbBr3 NC solids. Surprisingly, we observe a striking
dependence of the apparent exciton diffusivity on excitation laser power that
does not arise from nonlinear exciton-exciton interactions nor from thermal
heating of the sample. We interpret our observations with a model in which
excitons cause NCs to undergo a transition to a metastable configuration that
admits faster exciton transport by roughly an order of magnitude. This
metastable configuration persists for ~microseconds at room temperature, and
does not depend on the identity of surface ligands or presence of an oxide
shell, suggesting that it is an intrinsic response of the perovskite lattice to
electronic excitation. The exciton diffusivity observed here (>0.15 cm2/s) is
considerably higher than that observed in other NC systems on similar
timescales, revealing unusually strong excitonic coupling in a NC material. The
finding of a persistent enhancement in excitonic coupling between NCs may help

egomotion tracking of a vehicle in a reference map. The core idea is to map the
semantic objects observed by the vehicle and register them to their
corresponding objects in the reference map. While several recent works have
leveraged semantic information for cross-view localization, the main
contribution of this work is a view-invariant formulation that makes the
approach directly applicable to any viewpoint configuration for which objects
are detectable. Another distinctive feature is robustness to changes in the
environment/objects due to a data association scheme suited for extreme outlier
regimes (e.g., 90% association outliers). To demonstrate our framework, we
consider an example of localizing a ground vehicle in a reference object map
using only cars as objects. While only a stereo camera is used for the ground
vehicle, we consider reference maps constructed a priori from ground viewpoints
using stereo cameras and Lidar scans, and georeferenced aerial images captured
at a different date to demonstrate the framework's robustness to different
modalities, viewpoints, and environment changes. Evaluations on the KITTI
dataset show that over a 3.7 km trajectory, localization occurs in 36 sec and
is followed by real-time egomotion tracking with an average position error of
8.5 m in a Lidar reference map, and on an aerial object map where 77% of
objects are outliers, localization is achieved in 71 sec with an average
position error of 7.9 m.

minimizing the average access delay is then formulated. Next, we present a

demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme including the model

extended category of crystal structures from stable states via redistribution
of vacancies, researches on kinetic behavior of the vacancies are highly on
demand. However, they remain lacking due to difficulties with experimental
analysis. Herein, the direct observation of the evolution of chemical states of
vacancies clarifies the behavior by combining analysis on charge density
distribution, electrical conductivity, and crystal structures. Site-switching
of vacancies gradually occurs with diverged energy barriers owing to a unique
activation code-the accumulation of vacancies triggers spontaneous gliding
along atomic planes to relieve electrostatic repulsion. Study on the behavior
can be further applied to multi-phase superlattices composed of Sb2Te3 (2D) and
GeTe (3D) sublayers, which represent the superior memory performances but their
operating mechanisms were still under debates due to their complexity. The
site-switching is favorable (suppressed) when Te-Te bonds are formed as
physisorption (chemisorption) over the interface between Sb2Te3 (2D) and GeTe
(3D) sublayers driven by configurational entropic gain (electrostatic enthalpic
loss). Depending on the type of interfaces between sublayers, phases of the
superlattices are classified into metastable and stable states, where the
conversion could be only achieved in the metastable state. From this
comprehensive understanding on the operating mechanism via kinetic behaviors of
vacancies and the metastability, further studies towards vacancy engineering
are expected in versatile materials.

the training distribution. Detecting OOD inputs is challenging and essential
for the safe deployment of models. OOD detection has been studied extensively
for the classification task, but it has not received enough attention for the
object detection task, specifically LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this
paper, we focus on the detection of OOD inputs for LiDAR-based 3D object
detection. We formulate what OOD inputs mean for object detection and propose
to adapt several OOD detection methods for object detection. We accomplish this
by our proposed feature extraction method. To evaluate OOD detection methods,
we develop a simple but effective technique of generating OOD objects for a
given object detection model. Our evaluation based on the KITTI dataset shows
that different OOD detection methods have biases toward detecting specific OOD
objects. It emphasizes the importance of combined OOD detection methods and
more research in this direction.

at lower orders the needed consequences of the Jacobi identity are immediately
obtained from the associator mod $\bar{o}(\hbar^6)$, whereas at order $\hbar^7$

the Kontsevich graphs in the associator in strictly more than one step.

a preactivation state with a time-independent distribution. This implementation
fails to account for certain temporal differences inherent in the inputs and

it may also be desirable to account for the connections between time steps in
the normalization scheme. In this paper, we propose a normalization method
called Assorted-Time Normalization (ATN), which preserves information from
multiple consecutive time steps and normalizes using them. This setup allows us
to introduce longer time dependencies into the traditional normalization

robustness to failure of decentralised control methods and global performance
improvement of centralised control methods. The integrated structure of the

Furthermore, with comparable computation times, the proposed control approach

for AUVs to autonomously detect the attentiveness of a diver and then navigate

musculoskeletal (MSK) modelling predictions offer non-invasively obtainable
insights into in vivo joint and muscle loading, aiding clinical
decision-making. However, an OMC system is lab-based, expensive, and requires a
line of sight. Inertial Motion Capture (IMC) systems are widely-used
alternatives, which are portable, user-friendly, and relatively low-cost,
although with lesser accuracy. Irrespective of the choice of motion capture
technique, one needs to use an MSK model to obtain the kinematic and kinetic
outputs, which is a computationally expensive tool increasingly well
approximated by machine learning (ML) methods. Here, we present an ML approach
to map experimentally recorded IMC data to the human upper-extremity MSK model
outputs computed from ('gold standard') OMC input data. Essentially, we aim to
predict higher-quality MSK outputs from the much easier-to-obtain IMC data. We
use OMC and IMC data simultaneously collected for the same subjects to train
different ML architectures that predict OMC-driven MSK outputs from IMC
measurements. In particular, we employed various neural network (NN)
architectures, such as Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs) and Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) (vanilla, Long Short-Term Memory, and Gated Recurrent
Unit) and searched for the best-fit model through an exhaustive search in the
hyperparameters space in both subject-exposed (SE) & subject-naive (SN)
settings. We observed a comparable performance for both FFNN & RNN models,
which have a high degree of agreement (ravg, SE, FFNN = 0.90+/-0.19, ravg, SE,
RNN = 0.89+/-0.17, ravg, SN, FFNN = 0.84+/-0.23, & ravg, SN, RNN = 0.78+/-0.23)
with the desired OMC-driven MSK estimates for held-out test data. Mapping IMC
inputs to OMC-driven MSK outputs using ML models could be instrumental in
transitioning MSK modelling from 'lab to field'.

study of a new decentralized mechanism design problem called transaction fee
mechanism design (TFM). Unlike the classical mechanism design literature, in
the decentralized environment, even the auctioneer (i.e., the miner) can be a
strategic player, and it can even collude with a subset of the users
facilitated by binding side contracts. Chung and Shi showed two main
impossibility results that rule out the existence of a {\it dream} TFM. First,
any TFM that provides incentive compatibility for individual users and
miner-user coalitions must always have zero miner revenue, no matter whether
the block size is finite or infinite. Second, assuming finite block size, no
non-trivial TFM can simultaenously provide incentive compatibility for any
individual user, and for any miner-user coalition.
  In this work, we explore what new models and meaningful relaxations can allow
us to circumvent the impossibility results of Chung and Shi. Besides today's
model that does not employ cryptography, we introduce a new MPC-assisted model
where the TFM is implemented by a joint multi-party computation (MPC) protocol
among the miners. We prove several feasibility and infeasibility results for
achieving {\it strict} and {\it approximate} incentive compatibility,
respectively, in the plain model as well as the MPC-assisted model. We show
that while cryptography is not a panacea, it indeed allows us to overcome some
impossibility results pertaining to the plain model, leading to non-trivial
mechanisms with useful guarantees that are otherwise impossible in the plain
model. Our work is also the first to characterize the mathematical landscape of
transaction fee mechanism design under approximate incentive compatibility, as
well as in a cryptography-assisted model.

special mechanical properties of Maxwell lattices, including the ability to
focus zero-energy floppy modes and states of self-stress (SSS) at their edges
and interfaces. Due to their topological character, these phenomena are
protected against perturbations in the lattice geometry and material
properties, which makes them robust against the emergence of structural
non-idealities, defects, and damage. Recent computational work has shown that
the ability of Maxwell lattices to focus stress along prescribed SSS domain
walls can be harnessed for the purpose of protecting other regions in the bulk
of the lattice from detrimental stress concentration and, potentially,
inhibiting the onset of fracture mechanisms at stress hot spots such as holes
and cracks. This property provides a powerful, geometry-based tool for the
design of lattice configurations that are robust against damage and fracture.
In this work, we provide a comprehensive experiment-driven exploration of this
idea in the context of realistic structural lattices characterized by
non-ideal, finite-thickness hinges. Our experiments document the onset of
pronounced domain wall stress focusing, indicating a remarkable robustness of
the polarization even in the presence of the dilutive effects of the structural
hinges. We also demonstrate that the polarization protects the lattice against
potential failure from defected hinges and cracks in the bulk. Finally, we
illustrate numerically the superiority of SSS domain walls compared to other
trivial forms of reinforcements.

which there is no nodal precession: coplanar and polar. Nodal precession of a
misaligned test particle orbit centres on one of these stationary states. A low
mass circumbinary disc undergoes the same precession and moves towards one of
these states through dissipation within the disc. For a massive particle orbit,
the stationary polar alignment occurs at an inclination less than $90^{\circ}$,
this is the prograde-polar stationary inclination. A sufficiently high angular
momentum particle has an additional higher inclination stationary state, the
retrograde-polar stationary inclination. Misaligned particle orbits close to
the retrograde-polar stationary inclination are not nested like the orbits
close to the other stationary points. We investigate the evolution of a gas
disc that begins close to the retrograde-polar stationary inclination. With
hydrodynamical disc simulations, we find that the disc moves through the
unnested crescent shape precession orbits and eventually moves towards the
prograde-polar stationary inclination thus increasing the parameter space over
which circumbinary discs move towards polar alignment. If protoplanetary discs
form with an isotropic orientation relative to the binary orbit, then polar
discs may be more common than coplanar discs around eccentric binaries, even
for massive discs. This has implications for the alignment of circumbinary
planets.

the goal is to choose a subset of projects (i.e., a committee) with total size
at most $k$. Participatory budgeting mathematically generalizes multiwinner
elections, and both have received great attention in computational social
choice recently. A well-studied notion of group fairness in this setting is
core stability: Each voter is assigned an ""entitlement"" of $\frac{k}{n}$, so
that a subset $S$ of voters can pay for a committee of size at most $|S| \cdot
\frac{k}{n}$. A given committee is in the core if no subset of voters can pay
for another committee that provides each of them strictly larger utility. This
provides proportional representation to all voters in a strong sense.
  In this paper, we study the following auditing question: Given a committee
computed by some preference aggregation method, how close is it to the core?
Concretely, how much does the entitlement of each voter need to be scaled down
by, so that the core property subsequently holds? As our main contribution, we
present computational hardness results for this problem, as well as a
logarithmic approximation algorithm via linear program rounding. We show that
our analysis is tight against the linear programming bound. Additionally, we

properties. The first is Lindahl priceability, which audits the closeness of a
committee to a market clearing solution. We show that this is related to the
linear programming relaxation of auditing the core, leading to efficient exact
and approximation algorithms for auditing. The second is a novel weakening of

pairs have a finite momentum, presents an interesting challenge that has been
studied in a wide variety of systems. In conventional superconductors, this is
only possible when external fields lift the spin degeneracy of the Fermi
surface, leading to pair formation at an incommensurate momentum. Here, we
study a second possibility, potentially relevant to transition metal
dichalcogenides, in which the Fermi surface consists of a pair of pockets
centered at the $\pm K$ points of the Brillouin zone as well as a central
pocket at the $\Gamma$ point. In the limit where these three pockets are
identical, the pairing susceptibility has a logarithmic divergence at the
non-zero wave-vectors $\pm \mathbf{K}$, allowing for a weak-coupling analysis
of the PDW instability. We find that repulsive electronic interactions combine
to yield effective attractive interactions in the singlet and triplet PDW
channels, as long as the $\Gamma$ pocket is present. Because these PDW channels
decouple from the uniform superconducting channel, they can become the leading
unconventional pairing instability of the system. Upon solving the linearized
gap equations, we find that the PDW instability is robust against small
trigonal warping of the $\pm K$ pockets and small detuning between the $\Gamma$
and $\pm K$ pockets, which affect the PDW transition in a similar way as the
Zeeman magnetic field affects the uniform superconducting transition. We also
derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy for the PDW gaps with momenta $\pm
\mathbf{K}$, analyzing the conditions for and consequences of the emergence of
FF-type and LO-type PDW ground states. Our classification of the induced orders
in each ground state reveals unusual phases, including an odd-frequency

Monte Carlo fitting procedure, can recover flow parameters from non-turbulent
and turbulent flows. When the velocity and density gradients are excluded, we
find that flow parameters are well recovered from high resolution (20 $\rm{km}$
$\rm{s}^{-1}$) data and moderately well from medium resolution (100 $\rm{km}$
$\rm{s}^{-1}$) data without turbulence at a S/N = 10, while derived quantities
(e.g., mass outflow rates, column density, etc.) are well recovered at all
resolutions. In the turbulent case, biased errors emerge in the recovery of
individual parameters, but derived quantities are still well recovered.

for this task for their unique advantages but notwithstanding each method's
innate disadvantages. U-net, a conventional approach for conditional GANs,
retains fine details of unmasked regions but the style of the reconstructed
image is inconsistent with the rest of the original image and only works
robustly when the size of the occluding object is small enough. In contrast,
the modulated generative approach can deal with a larger occluded area in an

of the detailed features. This trade-off between these two models necessitates
an invention of a model that can be applied to any size of mask while

However, most of existing ensemble algorithms do not explicitly train all base

us to develop a new hierarchical learning algorithm for ensemble DRL that

state-of-the-art models can generate high-quality images of common entities,
they often have difficulty generating images of uncommon entities, such as
`Chortai (dog)' or `Picarones (food)'. To tackle this issue, we present the
Retrieval-Augmented Text-to-Image Generator (Re-Imagen), a generative model
that uses retrieved information to produce high-fidelity and faithful images,
even for rare or unseen entities. Given a text prompt, Re-Imagen accesses an
external multi-modal knowledge base to retrieve relevant (image, text) pairs
and uses them as references to generate the image. With this retrieval step,
Re-Imagen is augmented with the knowledge of high-level semantics and low-level
visual details of the mentioned entities, and thus improves its accuracy in
generating the entities' visual appearances. We train Re-Imagen on a
constructed dataset containing (image, text, retrieval) triples to teach the
model to ground on both text prompt and retrieval. Furthermore, we develop a
new sampling strategy to interleave the classifier-free guidance for text and
retrieval conditions to balance the text and retrieval alignment. Re-Imagen
achieves significant gain on FID score over COCO and WikiImage. To further
evaluate the capabilities of the model, we introduce EntityDrawBench, a new
benchmark that evaluates image generation for diverse entities, from frequent
to rare, across multiple object categories including dogs, foods, landmarks,
birds, and characters. Human evaluation on EntityDrawBench shows that Re-Imagen
can significantly improve the fidelity of generated images, especially on less

time-scales (0.01-100 seconds), with a complex pattern of lags in correlated
variability seen in different energy bands. This behaviour is generally
interpreted in a model where slow fluctuations stirred up at large radii
propagate down through the accretion flow, modulating faster fluctuations
generated at smaller radii. Coupling this scenario with radially-stratified
emission opens the way to measure the propagation time-scale from data,
allowing direct tests of the accretion flow structure. We previously developed
a model based on this picture and showed that it could fit NICER (0.5-10 keV)
data from the brightest recent black hole transient, MAXI J1820+070. However,
here we show it fails when extrapolated to higher energy variability data from
Insight-HXMT. We extend our model so that the spectrum emitted at each radius
changes shape in response to fluctuations (pivoting) rather than just changing
normalisation. This gives the strong suppression of fractional variability as a
function of energy seen in the data. The derived propagation time-scale is
slower than predicted by a magnetically arrested disc (MAD), despite this
system showing a strong jet. Our new model jointly fits the spectrum and
variability up to 50 keV, though still cannot match all the data above this.
Nonetheless, the good fit for 3-40 keV means the QPO can most easily be
explained as an extrinsic modulation of the flow, such as produced in
Lense-Thirring precession, rather than arising in an additional spectral-timing
component such as the jet.

photosphere. The EW of this line increases from the disk center to $\mu$ = 0.2,
and then decreases toward the solar limb, while the FWHM shows a monotonically
increasing trend. Theoretically predicted EW agrees well with observations,
while the predicted FWHM is far smaller due to the absence of unresolved
turbulence in models. The macroturbulent velocity is estimated to be 2.80 km
s$^{-1}$ at the disk center, and increases to 3.52 km s$^{-1}$ at $\mu$ = 0.2.

arbitrary tasks without undergoing fine-tuning after being prompted with only a
few labeled examples. An arbitrary task can be reformulated as a natural
language prompt, and a language model can be asked to generate the completion,
indirectly performing the task in a paradigm known as prompt-based learning. To
date, emergent prompt-based learning capabilities have mainly been demonstrated
for unidirectional language models. However, bidirectional language models
pre-trained on denoising objectives such as masked language modeling produce
stronger learned representations for transfer learning. This motivates the
possibility of prompting bidirectional models, but their pre-training
objectives have made them largely incompatible with the existing prompting
paradigm. We present SAP (Sequential Autoregressive Prompting), a technique
that enables the prompting of bidirectional models. Utilizing the machine
translation task as a case study, we prompt the bidirectional mT5 model (Xue et
al., 2021) with SAP and demonstrate its few-shot and zero-shot translations
outperform the few-shot translations of unidirectional models like GPT-3 and
XGLM (Lin et al., 2021), despite mT5's approximately 50% fewer parameters. We
further show SAP is effective on question answering and summarization. For the

property of a broader class of language models, rather than only unidirectional
models.

inference framework is presented, utilizing stochastic sub-gradient descent
(S-subGD) updates. The inference procedure handles cross-sectional data
sequentially: (i) updating the parameter estimate with each incoming ""new
observation"", (ii) aggregating it as a Polyak-Ruppert average, and (iii)
computing a pivotal statistic for inference using only a solution path. The
methodology draws from time series regression to create an asymptotically
pivotal statistic through random scaling. Our proposed test statistic is
calculated in a fully online fashion and critical values are calculated without
resampling. We conduct extensive numerical studies to showcase the
computational merits of our proposed inference. For inference problems as large
as $(n, d) \sim (10^7, 10^3)$, where $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the

field theory for ring polymers is applied to neutral atoms hydrogen to neon in
their ground states. The spontaneous emergence of atomic shell structure and
spherical symmetry-breaking of the total electron density is predicted by the
model using ideas of polymer excluded-volume between pairs of electrons to
enforce the Pauli-exclusion principle, and an exact electron self-interaction
correction. The Pauli potential is approximated and correlations are neglected,
leading to comparisons with Hartree-Fock theory, which also ignores
correlations. The model shows excellent agreement with Hartree-Fock theory for
the atomic binding energies and density profiles of the first six elements,
providing exact matches for the elements hydrogen and helium. The predicted
shell structure starts to deviate significantly past the element neon and
spherical symmetry-breaking is first predicted to occur at carbon instead of
boron. The self-consistent field theory energy functional which describes the
model is decomposed into thermodynamic components to trace the origin of
spherical symmetry-breaking. It is found to arise from the electron density
approaching closer to the nucleus in non-spherical distributions, which lowers
the energy despite resulting in frustration between the quantum kinetic energy,
electron-electron interaction, and the Pauli exclusion interaction. The
symmetry-breaking effect is also found to have minimal impact on the binding
energies. The pair density profiles display behaviour similar to polymer
macro-phase separation, where electron pairs occupy lobe-like structures that
combined together, resemble traditional electronic orbitals. It is further
shown that the predicted densities satisfy known constraints and produce the
same total electronic density profile that is predicted by quantum mechanics.

utilize a vectorial point spread function model to uncover the position of a

limited to the Rayleigh limit. We found that our technique accurately measures
the size of spherical dielectric nanoparticles in a purely optical and
non-contact way. We also tested fluorescent nanodiamonds (fND) and obtained a
reasonable estimate for the size of fND particles. Together with fluorescence
measurement from fND, we observed a correlation between the fluorescent signal

  Help Optimization?","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2110.03155",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of learning a set of probability distributions from
the Bellman dynamics in distributional reinforcement learning~(RL) that learns
the whole return distribution compared with only its expectation in classical
RL. Despite its success to obtain superior performance, we still have a poor
understanding of how the value distribution in distributional RL works. In this
study, we analyze the optimization benefits of distributional RL by leverage of
additional value distribution information over classical RL in the Neural
Fitted Z-Iteration~(Neural FZI) framework. To begin with, we demonstrate that
the distribution loss of distributional RL has desirable smoothness
characteristics and hence enjoys stable gradients, which is in line with its
tendency to promote optimization stability. Furthermore, the acceleration
effect of distributional RL is revealed by decomposing the return distribution.
It turns out that distributional RL can perform favorably if the value
distribution approximation is appropriate, measured by the variance of gradient
estimates in each environment for any specific distributional RL algorithm.
Rigorous experiments validate the stable optimization behaviors of
distributional RL, contributing to its acceleration effects compared to
classical RL. The findings of our research illuminate how the value
distribution in distributional RL algorithms helps the optimization.

widely used for graph-structured data processing due to their powerful

implicitly remove the non-predictive noises. However, the analysis of implicit
denoising effect in graph neural networks remains open. In this work, we
conduct a comprehensive theoretical study and analyze when and why the implicit

largely depends on the connectivity, the graph size, and GNN architectures.
Moreover, we formally define and propose the adversarial graph signal denoising

to induce a abrupt shift of the geometric phase. In our multi-level quantum

kinetic inductance (KI) nonlinearity. To date, only linear kinetic inductance
(KI) devices have been shown to operate in high magnetic fields, while
nonlinear KI device operation in high magnetic fields has received virtually no
attention. Here, we study the nonlinearity of superconducting nanowire (NW) KI

NbTiN films with characteristic impedance up to 3 k$\Omega$, and demonstrate
both nondegenerate and degenerate parametric amplification, at magnetic fields

the source image. On one hand, considering the object shapes of the synthesized
image and the driving frame might be different, we design a shape-invariant
motion adaptation module that enforces the consistency of the angles of object
parts in two images to capture the motion information. On the other hand, we
introduce a structure-guided appearance consistency module designed to
regularize the similarity between the corresponding patches of the synthesized

extensively as an effective deterministic algorithm for solving sparse
optimizations. The IHT algorithm benefits from the information of the batch
(full) gradient at each point and this information is a crucial key for the
convergence analysis of the generated sequence. However, this strength becomes
a weakness when it comes to machine learning and high dimensional statistical
applications because calculating the batch gradient at each iteration is
computationally expensive or impractical. Fortunately, in these applications
the objective function has a summation structure that can be taken advantage of
to approximate the batch gradient by the stochastic mini-batch gradient. In
this paper, we study the mini-batch Stochastic IHT (SIHT) algorithm for solving
the sparse optimizations. As opposed to previous works where increasing and
variable mini-batch size is necessary for derivation, we fix the mini-batch
size according to a lower bound that we derive and show our work. To prove
stochastic convergence of the objective value function we first establish a
critical sparse stochastic gradient descent property. Using this stochastic
gradient descent property we show that the sequence generated by the stochastic
mini-batch SIHT is a supermartingale sequence and converges with probability
one. Unlike previous work we do not assume the function to be a restricted
strongly convex. To the best of our knowledge, in the regime of sparse
optimization, this is the first time in the literature that it is shown that
the sequence of the stochastic function values converges with probability one

distributional expressivity of policy models, previous methods might still
select unseen actions during training, which deviates from their initial
motivation. To address this problem, we adopt a generative approach by
decoupling the learned policy into two parts: an expressive generative behavior
model and an action evaluation model. The key insight is that such decoupling
avoids learning an explicitly parameterized policy model with a closed-form
expression. Directly learning the behavior policy allows us to leverage
existing advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion-based methods, to
model diverse behaviors. As for action evaluation, we combine our method with

analyzing and synthesizing networked systems comprised of interconnected sets
of non-linear subsystems - only using the subsystem dissipativity properties.
In particular, this paper extends a recent work that proposed dissipativity
based centralized analysis techniques for non-linear networked systems as
linear matrix inequality (LMI) problems. First, we consider four networked
system configurations (NSCs) of interest and provide centralized
stability/dissipativity \emph{analysis} techniques for them as LMI problems.
Second, we show that the centralized interconnection topology \emph{synthesis}
techniques for these NSCs can also be developed as LMI problems. This enables
synthesizing the interconnection topology among the subsystems so that specific
stability/dissipativity measures of the networked system are optimized. Next,
we show that the proposed analysis and synthesis techniques can be implemented
in a decentralized and compositional manner (i.e., subsystems can be
added/removed conveniently). Finally, we include several numerical results to
demonstrate our contributions.

  Feature Suppression","DICTA 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well-known that a deep neural network has a strong fitting capability
and can easily achieve a low training error even with randomly assigned class
labels. When the number of training samples is small, or the class labels are
noisy, networks tend to memorize patterns specific to individual instances to
minimize the training error. This leads to the issue of overfitting and poor
generalisation performance. This paper explores a remedy by suppressing the
network's tendency to rely on instance-specific patterns for empirical error
minimisation. The proposed method is based on an adversarial training
framework. It suppresses features that can be utilized to identify individual
instances among samples within each class. This leads to classifiers only using
features that are both discriminative across classes and common within each
class. We call our method Adversarial Suppression of Identity Features (ASIF),
and demonstrate the usefulness of this technique in boosting generalisation
accuracy when faced with small datasets or noisy labels. Our source code is
available.

More recently, it was exploited by the author to develop a highly efficient
solver for second order linear ordinary differential equations whose solutions
are oscillatory. In many cases of interest, that algorithm achieves near
optimal accuracy in time independent of the frequency of oscillation of the
solutions. Here we show that, after minor modifications, it also allows for the
efficient solution of second order differential equation equations which have
turning points. That is, it is effective in the case of equations whose
solutions are oscillatory in some regions and behave like linear combinations
of increasing and decreasing exponential functions in others. We present the

exoplanets with Earth-like insolation. It is expected that some of those
planets are rocky planets with the potential for temperate climates favourable
to surface liquid water. However, various models predict that terrestrial
planets orbiting in the classical habitable zone around M dwarfs have no water
or too much water, suggesting that habitable planets around M dwarfs might be
rare. Here we present the results of an updated planetary population synthesis
model, which includes the effects of water enrichment in the primordial
atmosphere, caused by the oxidation of atmospheric hydrogen by rocky materials
from incoming planetesimals and from the magma ocean. We find that this water
production in the primordial atmosphere is found to significantly impact the
occurrence of terrestrial rocky aqua planets, yielding ones with diverse water
content. We estimate that 5-10% of the planets with a size $<1.3 R_\oplus$
orbiting early-to-mid M dwarfs have appropriate amounts of seawater for
habitability. Such an occurrence rate would be high enough to detect
potentially habitable planets by ongoing and near-future M-dwarf planet survey
missions.

recognise quantum states, it is possible to sense the amount of entanglement
after training with only non-entangled states. Furthermore, by taking into
account measurement errors, we demonstrate entanglement sensing with precision
that scales beyond the standard quantum limit and outperforms measurements
performed directly on the objects. Finally, we utilise our platform for sensing
gravity-induced entanglement between two masses and predict an improvement of
two orders of magnitude in the precision of entanglement estimation compared to

representation learning (DARL) model that leverages a denoising diffusion
probabilistic model with adversarial learning, and apply it to vessel
segmentation. In particular, for self-supervised vessel segmentation, DARL
learns the background signal using a diffusion module, which lets a generation
module effectively provide vessel representations. Also, by adversarial
learning based on the proposed switchable spatially-adaptive denormalization,
our model estimates synthetic fake vessel images as well as vessel segmentation
masks, which further makes the model capture vessel-relevant semantic
information. Once the proposed model is trained, the model generates
segmentation masks in a single step and can be applied to general vascular
structure segmentation of coronary angiography and retinal images. Experimental
results on various datasets show that our method significantly outperforms
existing unsupervised and self-supervised vessel segmentation methods.

rules are sparse as we first select the smallest set of variables having a high

the effectiveness of our counterfactual rules in comparison to standard CE and

research and development. Diffusion of particles, particularly, controlled

from targeted drug deliveries, novel procedures for quantifying physical
properties of nanoparticles and ambient fluids, to fabrication of composites
with enhanced properties. In this work, we report a systematic analysis on
field-controlled diffusion of microstructured particles. In account of shape
anisotropy and structural heterogeneity of a particle, we study coupled
Brownian motions of the particle in $\mathbb{R}^3\times$SO(3). Starting from
the microscopic stochastic differential equations of motions, we achieve the
coarse-grained Fokker-Planck equation that governs the evolution of the
probability distribution function with respect to the position and orientation
of the particle. Under some mild conditions, we identify the long-time
diffusivity for microstructured particles in an external field. The formulation
is applicable to microstructured particles of arbitrary shapes and
heterogeneities. As examples of applications, we analyze the diffusion of a
heterogeneous spheroidal particle and a pair of spheroidal particles bonded by
an elastic ligament. For heterogeneous spheroidal particles, we obtain explicit
generalized Stokes-Einstein's relations for diffusivity that accounts for the
effects of shape anisotropy, heterogeneity, and an external alignment field.
For pairs of spheroidal particles, we consider the superimposed relaxation
process from an initial non-equilibrium state to the final equilibrium state.
The anomalous scaling of Mean Square Displacement (MSD) with respect to the

anomalous diffusions observed in migration of macromolecules and cells in

Specifically, we find that its sub-optimality lies in the improper application

the galactic evolution, star-formation and enrichment histories. Recent
observations of disk galaxies suggest that if large-scale azimuthal metallicity
variations appear in the ISM, they are linked to the spiral arms. In this work,
using a set of chemodynamical simulations of the Milky Way-like spiral
galaxies, we quantify the impact of gas radial motions~(migration) in the
presence of a pre-existing radial metallicity gradient and the local ISM
enrichment on both global and local variations of the mean ISM metallicity in
the vicinity of the spiral arms.
  In all the models, we find the scatter of the gas metallicity of
\approx0.04-0.06 dex at a given galactocentric distance. On large scales, we
observe the presence of spiral-like metallicity patterns in the ISM which are
more prominent in models with the radial metallicity gradient. However, in our
simulations, the morphology of the large-scale ISM metallicity distributions
significantly differs from the spiral arms structure in stellar/gas components
resulting in both positive and negative residual~(after subtraction of the
radial gradient) metallicity trends along spiral arms. We discuss the
correlations of the residual ISM metallicity values with the star formation
rate, gas kinematics and offset to the spiral arms, concluding that the
presence of a radial metallicity gradient is essential for the azimuthal
variations of metallicity. At the same time, the local enrichment alone is
unlikely to drive systematic variations of the metallicity across the spirals.

most existing approaches that enforce the coupling constraints from the

closed electronic shells and zero spin. In order to explain the stability of
open shell clusters, it is necessary to consider the case of non-degenerate
energy levels. In this paper the energy levels in nine low-lying Li$_{19}$
clusters are analysed systematically through superatomic orbital splitting
effect. It is found that for originally degenerate orbitals like five 1D
orbitals, the more the orbital extends in the direction of the cluster
extension, the lower the energy of the orbital becomes. So oblate Li$_{19}$
clusters have the orbital sequence of
$1\mathrm{S}^2-1\mathrm{P}_{x/y}^{4}-1\mathrm{P}_{z}^{2}-1\mathrm{D}_{xy/x^2-y^2}^{4}-2\mathrm{S}^2-1\mathrm{D}_{xz/yz}^{4}-1\mathrm{D}_{z^2}^{1}$,
while prolate Li$_{19}$ clusters have the sequence of
$1\mathrm{S}^2-1\mathrm{P}_{z}^{2}-1\mathrm{P}_{x/y}^{4}-1\mathrm{D}_{z^2}^{2}-1\mathrm{D}_{xz/yz}^{4}-1\mathrm{D}_{xy/x^2-y^2}^{4}-2\mathrm{S}^1$.
This electron configuration is applied to predict the shape and magnetic moment
of the alkali metal Li$_{n}$ clusters. The stability of the Li$_{14}$ cluster
can be successfully interpreted in the framework of orbital splitting effect
without resorting to the super valence bond (SVB) model, indicating a
non-spherical cluster can achieve good stability without meeting the magic
number. It is also proposed that the orbital splitting can be used to predict
the shape (prolate, oblate or sphere) and magnetic moment of clusters. 11 out
of 16 predicted shapes of Li$_n(n=3-18)$ are consistent with the results
obtained by the principle of minimum energy.

radiation escaping from the galactic environment ($f_\mathrm{esc}$) and the
ionisation topology. To this end, we consider the two physically plausible
bracketing scenarios of $f_\mathrm{esc}$ increasing and decreasing with rising
halo mass. We derive the corresponding observed Ly$\alpha$ luminosities of
galaxies for three different analytic Ly$\alpha$ line profiles and associated
Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction ($f_\mathrm{esc}^\mathrm{Ly\alpha}$) models:
importantly, we introduce two novel analytic Ly$\alpha$ line profile models
that describe the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) as outflowing dusty gas
clumps. They are based on parameterising results from radiative transfer
simulations, with one of them relating $f_\mathrm{esc}^\mathrm{Ly\alpha}$ to
$f_\mathrm{esc}$ by assuming the ISM of being interspersed with low-density
tunnels. Our key findings are: (i) for outflowing clumps, the Ly$\alpha$ line
profile develops from a central to double peak profile as a galaxy's halo mass
increases; (ii) LAEs are galaxies with $M_h\gtrsim10^{10}M_\odot$ located in
overdense and highly ionised regions; (iii) for this reason, the spatial
distribution of LAEs is primarily sensitive to the global ionisation fraction
and only weakly in second-order to the ionisation topology or a halo
mass-dependent $f_\mathrm{esc}$; (iv) furthermore, as the observed Ly$\alpha$
luminosity functions reflect the Ly$\alpha$ emission from more massive
galaxies, there is a degeneracy between the $f_\mathrm{esc}$-dependent
intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and the Ly$\alpha$ attenuation by dust in the
ISM if $f_\mathrm{esc}$ does not exceed $\sim50\%$.

diffusion processes using score functions to synthesize data from noise. The
sampling process of diffusion models can be interpreted as solving the reverse
stochastic differential equation (SDE) or the ordinary differential equation
(ODE) of the diffusion process, which often requires up to thousands of
discretization steps to generate a single image. This has sparked a great
interest in developing efficient integration techniques for reverse-S/ODEs.
Here, we propose an orthogonal approach to accelerating score-based sampling:
Denoising MCMC (DMCMC). DMCMC first uses MCMC to produce samples in the product
space of data and variance (or diffusion time). Then, a reverse-S/ODE
integrator is used to denoise the MCMC samples. Since MCMC traverses close to
the data manifold, the computation cost of producing a clean sample for DMCMC
is much less than that of producing a clean sample from noise. To verify the
proposed concept, we show that Denoising Langevin Gibbs (DLG), an instance of
DMCMC, successfully accelerates all six reverse-S/ODE integrators considered in
this work on the tasks of CIFAR10 and CelebA-HQ-256 image generation. Notably,
combined with integrators of Karras et al. (2022) and pre-trained score models
of Song et al. (2021b), DLG achieves SOTA results. In the limited number of

However, when the data size and model complexity increase, the number of

promising paradigm for tackling this type of problem is surrogate-based
optimization. The main idea underlying this paradigm considers an incrementally
updated model of the relation between the hyperparameter space and the output

learning engine, which is, for example, a factorization machine-based model. By
learning to approximate the hyperparameter-target relation, the surrogate
(machine learning) model can be used to score large amounts of hyperparameter
configurations, exploring parts of the configuration space beyond the reach of
direct machine learning engine evaluation. Commonly, a surrogate is selected
prior to optimization initialization and remains the same during the search. We
investigated whether dynamic switching of surrogates during the optimization
itself is a sensible idea of practical relevance for selecting the most
appropriate factorization machine-based models for large-scale online
recommendation. We conducted benchmarks on data sets containing hundreds of
millions of instances against established baselines such as Random Forest- and

to monitor the quality of the approximate solution. One of the most relevant
quantities for measuring the quality of the approximate solution is the
$A$-norm of the error. This quantity cannot be easily computed, however, it can
be estimated. In this paper we discuss and analyze the behaviour of the
Gauss-Radau upper bound on the $A$-norm of the error, based on viewing CG as a
procedure for approximating a certain Riemann-Stieltjes integral. This upper
bound depends on a prescribed underestimate $\mu$ to the smallest eigenvalue of
$A$. We concentrate on explaining a phenomenon observed during computations
showing that, in later CG iterations, the upper bound loses its accuracy, and
is almost independent of $\mu$. We construct a model problem that is used to
demonstrate and study the behaviour of the upper bound in dependence of $\mu$,
and developed formulas that are helpful in understanding this behavior. We show
that the above mentioned phenomenon is closely related to the convergence of
the smallest Ritz value to the smallest eigenvalue of $A$. It occurs when the
smallest Ritz value is a better approximation to the smallest eigenvalue than
the prescribed underestimate $\mu$. We also suggest an adaptive strategy for
improving the accuracy of the upper bounds in the previous iterations.

that the critical exponents $\gamma, \nu$ can change continuously as a coupling
is varied, while their ratio is fixed to the 2-d Ising value. While such weak
universality is well-known for spin models, we demonstrate this for LGTs for
the first time. Using an efficient cluster algorithm, we show that the finite
temperature phase transition of the $U(1)$ quantum link LGT in the spin
$S=\frac{1}{2}$ representation is in the 2-d XY universality class, as
expected. On the addition of $Q = \pm 2e$ charges distributed thermally, we
demonstrate the occurrence of weak universality.

  We consider non-iso-density emulsions, where the dispersed phase is the
lighter one. The segregation process is driven by both the minimization of the
potential energy achieved by the sinking of the heavier phase, as well as the
minimization of the surface energy achieved by coalescence. To study these two
processes and their impacts on the segregation progress in detail, we consider
different buoyancy forces and surface tension coefficients in our
investigation, resulting in five different configurations. The surface tension
coefficient also alters the droplet size distribution of the emulsion.
  Using the three-dimensional simulation results and the monitored data, we
analyze the driving mechanisms and their impact on the segregation progress in
detail. We propose a dimensionless number that reflects the energy release
dominating the segregation. Moreover, we evaluate the time required for the
rise of the lighter phase and study correlations with the varied parameters

complex problems that involve math reasoning over heterogeneous information,

require mathematical reasoning on both textual and tabular data. Each question
in TabMWP is aligned with a tabular context, which is presented as an image,
semi-structured text, and a structured table. There are two types of questions:
free-text and multi-choice, and each problem is annotated with gold solutions

studies suggest, since few-shot GPT-3 relies on the selection of in-context
examples, its performance is unstable and can degrade to near chance. The
unstable issue is more severe when handling complex problems like TabMWP. To
mitigate this, we further propose a novel approach, PromptPG, which utilizes
policy gradient to learn to select in-context examples from a small amount of
training data and then constructs the corresponding prompt for the test
example. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the best

significantly compared to random selection, which verifies its effectiveness in

yields, showing a great potential for agricultural index insurance. This paper
identifies an important threat to better insurance from these new technologies:
data with many fields and few years can yield downward biased estimates of
basis risk, a fundamental metric in index insurance. To demonstrate this bias,
we use state-of-the-art satellite-based data on agricultural yields in the US
and in Kenya to estimate and simulate basis risk. We find a substantive
downward bias leading to a systematic overestimation of insurance quality.
  In this paper, we argue that big data in crop insurance can lead to a new
situation where the number of variables $N$ largely exceeds the number of
observations $T$. In such a situation where $T\ll N$, conventional asymptotics
break, as evidenced by the large bias we find in simulations. We show how the
high-dimension, low-sample-size (HDLSS) asymptotics, together with the spiked
covariance model, provide a more relevant framework for the $T\ll N$ case
encountered in index insurance. More precisely, we derive the asymptotic
distribution of the relative share of the first eigenvalue of the covariance
matrix, a measure of systematic risk in index insurance. Our formula accurately
approximates the empirical bias simulated from the satellite data, and provides
a useful tool for practitioners to quantify bias in insurance quality.

  Our generic implementation includes the often used equations of state
Soave-Redlich-Kwong and Peng-Robinson and the Redlich-Kwong-Peng-Robinson
(RKPR) equation of state. The first two assume a universal compressibility
factor and are therefore only suitable for fluids with a matching critical
compressibility. The Redlich-Kwong-Peng-Robinson overcomes this limitation by
considering the equation of state parameter as function of the critical
compressibility. We compare the resulting thermodynamic modeling for the three

shown that a large number of weights can be safely removed from modern neural
networks without compromising accuracy. Numerous pruning methods have been
proposed since then, each claiming to be better than the previous. Many
state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques today rely on complex pruning methodologies
utilizing importance scores, getting feedback through back-propagation or
having heuristics-based pruning rules amongst others. We question this pattern
of introducing complexity in order to achieve better pruning results. We
benchmark these SOTA techniques against Global Magnitude Pruning (Global MP), a
naive pruning baseline, to evaluate whether complexity is really needed to
achieve higher performance. Global MP ranks weights in order of their
magnitudes and prunes the smallest ones. Hence, in its vanilla form, it is one
of the simplest pruning techniques. Surprisingly, we find that vanilla Global
MP outperforms all the other SOTA techniques and achieves a new SOTA result. It
also achieves good performance on FLOPs sparsification, which we find is
enhanced, when pruning is conducted in a gradual fashion. We also find that
Global MP is generalizable across tasks, datasets and models with superior
performance. Moreover, a common issue that many pruning algorithms run into at
high sparsity rates, namely, layer-collapse, can be easily fixed in Global MP
by setting a minimum threshold of weights to be retained in each layer. Lastly,
unlike many other SOTA techniques, Global MP does not require any additional
algorithm specific hyper-parameters and is very straightforward to tune and
implement. We showcase our findings on various models (WRN-28-8, ResNet-32,
ResNet-50, MobileNet-V1 and FastGRNN) and multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet

in view of exactness of a quadrature formula at degree $2L$, HTH approximates
the Fourier coefficients of a continuous function and obtains its coefficients
by acting a hard thresholding operator on all approximated Fourier

basis element selection ability. The main results of HTH for continuous and

independently of the polynomial degree; and the $L_2$ error bound of HTH is
greater than that of hyperinterpolation but HTH performs well in denoising. We
conclude with some numerical experiments to demonstrate the denoising ability

the massive amount of memory of saved deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)

inefficient medical data sharing. Therefore, this study proposes a novel
soft-label dataset distillation method for medical data sharing.
  Methods: The proposed method distills valid information of medical image data
and generates several compressed images with different data distributions for
anonymous medical data sharing. Furthermore, our method can extract essential
weights of DCNN models to reduce the memory required to save trained models for
efficient medical data sharing.
  Results: The proposed method can compress tens of thousands of images into
several soft-label images and reduce the size of a trained model to a few
hundredths of its original size. The compressed images obtained after
distillation have been visually anonymized; therefore, they do not contain the
private information of the patients. Furthermore, we can realize high-detection
performance with a small number of compressed images.

dependences of both fluctuation conductivity $\sigma^\prime(T)$ and the

the local pair model. Here we show that with an increase in $\phi$, the value
of $\rho(300 K)$ increases linearly, while $T_c$ decreases linearly.
Concurrently, the value of $\rho{100 K}$ increases nonlinearly, demonstrating a
feature for $\phi_3$ = 4.3 10$^{18}$ e/$cm^2$, which is also observed in the
number of other dose-dependent parameters.Regardless of the irradiation dose,
in the temperature range from $T_c$ up to $T_{01}$, $\sigma^\prime(T)$ obeys
the classical fluctuation theories of Aslamazov$-$Larkin and Maki$-$Thompson,
demonstrating 3D$-$2D crossover with increasing temperature. The crossover
temperature $T_0$ makes it possible to determine the coherence length along the
$c$-axis, $\xi_c(T)$, which increases by $\approx 3$ times under irradiation.
Furthermore, the range of superconducting fluctuations above $T_c$ also
noticeably increases.At $\phi$ = 0, the dependence $\Delta^*(T)$ typical for
single crystals containing pronounced twin boundaries is observed with a
maximum at $T_{pair}$ ~ 120 K and a distinct minimum at $T = T_{01}$. It was
determined for the first time that at $\phi_3$ = 4.3 10$^{18}$ the shape of
$\Delta^*(T)$ changes strongly and becomes the same as in optimally doped
$YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}$ single crystals with a very low pseudogap opening
temperature $T^*$ and noticeably reduced $T_{pair}$, while at $T_c(\phi)$ there
are no singularities.

over a half of radio-dim ones, are over-luminous in radio with respect to the
far-infrared--radio correlation. High-resolution radio maps reveal that the
overwhelming majority of radio-dim sources are unresolved on arcsecond scale,
while the bulk of radio-bright sources display extended jets and lobes of low-
and intermediate-power radio galaxies; those jets dominate radio emission of
radio-bright objects. Regarding the origin of the radio emission of radio-dim
sources, we discuss the two main possibilities. One is the ADAF model, in which
the radio and the nuclear X-ray radiative outputs at very low accretion rates,
are both dominated by unresolved jets. The other possibility is that the
radio-dim sources, unlike the radio-bright ones, are characterized by low
values of SMBH spins, so that their radio emission is not related to the jets,
but instead is due to a combination of starforming processes and past nuclear
outbursts.

  Robot Localization without a Base Station","7 pages, 4 figures, accompanying video: https://youtu.be/55BLjt6ce1Y,
  accepted to the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
  (ICRA)",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate localization is a core component of a robot's navigation system. To
this end, global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) can provide absolute
measurements outdoors and, therefore, eliminate long-term drift. However,
fusing GNSS data with other sensor data is not trivial, especially when a robot
moves between areas with and without sky view. We propose a robust approach
that tightly fuses raw GNSS receiver data with inertial measurements and,
optionally, lidar observations for precise and smooth mobile robot
localization. A factor graph with two types of GNSS factors is proposed. First,
factors based on pseudoranges, which allow for global localization on Earth.
Second, factors based on carrier phases, which enable highly accurate relative
localization, which is useful when other sensing modalities are challenged.
Unlike traditional differential GNSS, this approach does not require a
connection to a base station. On a public urban driving dataset, our approach
achieves accuracy comparable to a state-of-the-art algorithm that fuses visual
inertial odometry with GNSS data -- despite our approach not using the camera,
just inertial and GNSS data. We also demonstrate the robustness of our approach
using data from a car and a quadruped robot moving in environments with little
sky visibility, such as a forest. The accuracy in the global Earth frame is
still 1-2 m, while the estimated trajectories are discontinuity-free and
smooth. We also show how lidar measurements can be tightly integrated. We
believe this is the first system that fuses raw GNSS observations (as opposed
to fixes) with lidar in a factor graph.

diagrams and identify mobility edges. Intriguingly, for large disorder the
survival of the compactly-localized states induces the existence of delocalized
eigenstates close to the original flat band energies -- yielding seemingly
divergent mobility edges. For small disorder, however, a change from extended
to localized behavior can be found upon decreasing disorder -- leading to an
unconventional ``inverse Anderson"" behavior. We show that transfer matrix
methods, computing the localization lengths, as well as sparse-matrix
diagonalization, using spectral gap-ratio energy-level statistics, are in
excellent quantitative agreement. The preservation of the compactly-localized
states even in the presence of this disorder might be useful for envisaged
storage applications.

the Sun occasionally slips into quiescent phases known as solar grand minima,

dynamo model with stochastic fluctuations in the mean-field and
Babcock-Leighton poloidal field source terms to simulate solar cycle
variability. Our long-term simulations detect a gradual decay of the polar
field during solar grand minima episodes. Although regular active region
emergence stops, compromising the Babcock-Leighton mechanism, weak magnetic
activity continues during minima phases sustained by a mean-field
$\alpha$-effect; surprisingly, periodic polar field amplitude modulation
persist during these phases. A spectral analysis of the simulated polar flux
time series shows that the 11-year cycle becomes less prominent while high
frequency periods and periods around 22 years manifest during grand minima
episodes. Analysis of long-term solar open flux observations appears to be
consistent with this finding. Through numerical experimentation we demonstrate
that the persistence of periodic amplitude modulation in the polar field and
the dominant frequencies during grand minima episodes are governed by the speed
of the meridional plasma flow -- which appears to act as a clock.

preoperatively and avoid the risk of cement leakage. Therefore, the aim of this
work was to introduce a computationally feasible and experimentally validated
model for simulating vertebroplasty. The developed model is a multiphase
continuum-mechanical macro-scale model based on the Theory of Porous Media. The
related governing equations were discretized using a combined Finite Element -
Finite Volume approach by the so-called Box discretization. Three different
rheological upscaling methods were used to compare and determine the most
suitable approach for this application. For validation, a benchmark experiment
was set up and simulated using the model. The influence of bone marrow and
parameters like permeability, porosity, etc., was investigated to study the
effect of varying conditions on vertebroplasty. The presented model could
realistically simulate the injection of bone cement in porous materials when
used with the correct rheological upscaling models, of which the
semi-analytical averaging of the viscosity gave the best results. The marrow
viscosity is identified as the crucial reference to categorize bone cements as
high- or low- viscosity in the context of vertebroplasty. It is confirmed that
a cement with higher viscosity than the marrow ensures stable development of
the injection and a proper cement interdigitation inside the vertebra.

behavior. Indolent RCC is often low-grade without necrosis and can be monitored
without treatment. Aggressive RCC is often high-grade and can cause metastasis
and death if not promptly detected and treated. While most kidney cancers are
detected on CT scans, grading is based on histology from invasive biopsy or
surgery. Determining aggressiveness on CT images is clinically important as it
facilitates risk stratification and treatment planning. This study aims to use
machine learning methods to identify radiology features that correlate with
features on pathology to facilitate assessment of cancer aggressiveness on CT
images instead of histology. This paper presents a novel automated method,
Correlated Feature Aggregation By Region (CorrFABR), for classifying
aggressiveness of clear cell RCC by leveraging correlations between radiology
and corresponding unaligned pathology images. CorrFABR consists of three main
steps: (1) Feature Aggregation where region-level features are extracted from
radiology and pathology images, (2) Fusion where radiology features correlated
with pathology features are learned on a region level, and (3) Prediction where
the learned correlated features are used to distinguish aggressive from
indolent clear cell RCC using CT alone as input. Thus, during training,
CorrFABR learns from both radiology and pathology images, but during inference,
CorrFABR will distinguish aggressive from indolent clear cell RCC using CT
alone, in the absence of pathology images. CorrFABR improved classification
performance over radiology features alone, with an increase in binary
classification F1-score from 0.68 (0.04) to 0.73 (0.03). This demonstrates the
potential of incorporating pathology disease characteristics for improved
classification of aggressiveness of clear cell RCC on CT images.

we present a systematic expansion of the two-point correlators in powers of the
temperature T and the chemical potential $\Omega$.
  The holographic result is in agreement with the general form of the OPE which
dictates that the two-point function may be written as a linear combination of
the Gegenbauer polynomials $C_J^{(1)}(\xi)$ but with the coefficients depending
now on both the temperature and the chemical potential, as well as on the CFT
data. The leading terms in this expansion originate from the expectation values
of the scalar operator $\phi^2$, the R-current ${\cal J}^\mu_{\phi_3}$ and the

  By employing the Ward identity for the R-current and by comparing the
appropriate term of the holographic result for the two-point correlator to the
corresponding term in the OPE, we derive the value of the R-charge density of
the background. Compelling agreement with the analysis of the thermodynamics of
the black hole is found. Finally, we determine the behaviour of the two-point
correlators, in the case of finite temperature, and in the limit of large
temporal or spatial distance of the operators.

spectrum of the NCHO has remarkable properties, including the presence of
number theoretical structures such as modular forms, elliptic curves and
Eichler cohomology observed in the special values of the associated spectral
zeta function. In addition, the Heun ODE picture of the eigenvalue problem of
the NCHO reveals a connection with the quantum Rabi model (QRM), a fundamental
interaction model from quantum optics. In this paper we introduce an
$\eta$-shifted NCHO ($\eta$-NCHO) that has an analogous relation with the
asymmetric quantum Rabi model (AQRM) and describe its basic properties. Even
though the shift factor does not break the parity symmetry of the NCHO, a
certain type of degeneracies appears for $\eta \in \frac12 \mathbb{Z}$, as if
mirroring the situation of the AQRM. We give furthermore a detailed description
of the confluence process, that we call iso-parallel confluence process due to
the fact that it requires a parallel transformation of two parameters
describing the spectrum of $\eta$-NCHO and representations of
$\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{R})$. We relate the eigenvalues of the two models
under the iso-parallel confluence process, including how the quasi-exact
eigenfunctions of the $\eta$-NCHO correspond to Juddian solutions of the AQRM.
From the point of view of this confluence process, a family of $\eta$-NCHO
corresponds to a single AQRM, thus we may regard the $\eta$-NCHO as a covering
of the AQRM. We expect the study of the $\eta$-NCHO and the AQRM from this
point of view to be helpful for the clarification of several questions on the
AQRM, including the hidden symmetry and the number of Juddian solutions.

limited set of objectives or generic downstream tasks that predominantly target
uni-modal applications. This has isolated progress for imperative multi-modal
applications that are diverse in terms of complexity and domain-affinity, such
as meme analysis. Here, we introduce two self-supervised pre-training methods,
namely Ext-PIE-Net and MM-SimCLR that (i) employ off-the-shelf multi-modal
hate-speech data during pre-training and (ii) perform self-supervised learning
by incorporating multiple specialized pretext tasks, effectively catering to
the required complex multi-modal representation learning for meme analysis. We
experiment with different self-supervision strategies, including potential
variants that could help learn rich cross-modality representations and evaluate
using popular linear probing on the Hateful Memes task. The proposed solutions
strongly compete with the fully supervised baseline via label-efficient
training while distinctly outperforming them on all three tasks of the Memotion
challenge with 0.18%, 23.64%, and 0.93% performance gain, respectively.
Further, we demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed solutions by
reporting competitive performance on the HarMeme task. Finally, we empirically
establish the quality of the learned representations by analyzing task-specific
learning, using fewer labeled training samples, and arguing that the complexity
of the self-supervision strategy and downstream task at hand are correlated.
Our efforts highlight the requirement of better multi-modal self-supervision
methods involving specialized pretext tasks for efficient fine-tuning and
generalizable performance.

allowable in quantum gravity. These discussions assumed that the matter fields
were real valued. We make the observation that for compactified solutions it
makes sense to demand convergence of the theory's path integral in the
higher-dimensional parent theory. Upon compactification this allows for more
general matter configurations in the lower-dimensional theory, in particular it
allows for complex scalar fields, with a bound on their imaginary parts.
Similar considerations apply to metric rescalings in the presence of higher
curvature corrections. We illustrate this effect with the example of the
no--boundary proposal, in which scalar fields are typically required to take
complex values. We find that complex no-boundary solutions exist, and satisfy
the derived bound, if the potential is sufficiently flat. For instance, for a
compactification from $D$ dimensions, the bound on the imaginary part
$\textrm{Im}\,(\phi)$ of the internal volume modulus reads $V_{,\phi}/V <
\sqrt{\frac{D-4}{D-2}}/3\sqrt{2}.$ This leads to a mild tension with swampland

background illumination problem, (3) vignetting effects, and (4) misaligning of
LED positions, without the need of calibrating or recovering of these system

of feature extraction/recovering and proposed a new data fidelity cost function
regularized by the global second-order total-variation regularization (Hessian
regularization). The closed-form complex gradient for the cost function is
derived and is back-propagated using the AdaBelief optimizer with an adaptive
learning rate to update the entire Fourier spectrum of the sample and system
pupil function. The Elfpie is tested on both simulation data and experimental
data and is compared against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithm. Results
show the superiority of the Elfpie among other SOTA methods, in both
reconstruction quality under different degeneration issues, and implementation
efficiency. In general, compared against SOTA methods, the Elfpie is robust to
Gaussian noise with 100 times larger noise strength, salt & pepper noise with
1000 times larger noise strength, and Poisson noise with 10 times noise
strength. The Elfpie is able to reconstruct high-fidelity sample field under
large LED position misalignments up to 2 mm. It can also bypass the vignetting
effect in which all SOTA methods fail to reconstruct the sample pattern. With
parallel computation, the Elfpie is able to be K times faster than traditional
FPM, where K is the number of used LEDs.

the electroweak phase transition, compared to that of the original
two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM). The strength of the electroweak phase
transition $(S)$ in the model under consideration is large enough for the
first-order EWPT, specifically $1 < S < 2.8$. The ratio between the two vacuum
expectation values (VEVs), $\tan\beta = v_2/v_1$, is proven to have no effects
on the strength of the phase transition. This ratio only affects the mass
domain that causes the first-order phase transition. Furthermore, in this paper
we will show clearly that when studying the EWPT in models of more than one
scalar field that generates masses, one needs to analyze the problem of phase
transition under multiple stages. In other words, the effect of the first stage
of symmetry breaking to the second one, is to simplify by suggestion that
vacuum expectation value of the Higgs boson responsible for the initial stage

attention to defend against contention-based cache side channels. By
randomizing and regularly changing the mapping(s) of addresses to cache sets,
these techniques are designed to obfuscate the leakage of memory access
patterns. However, new attack techniques, e.g., Prime+Prune+Probe, soon
demonstrated the limits of RSCs as they allow attackers to more quickly learn
which addresses contend in the cache and use this information to circumvent the
randomization. To yet maintain side-channel resilience, RSCs must change the
random mapping(s) more frequently with adverse effects on performance and
implementation complexity. This work aims to make randomization-based
approaches more robust to allow for reduced re-keying rates and presents
Chameleon Cache. Chameleon Cache extends RSCs with a victim cache (VC) to
decouple contention in the RSC from evictions observed by the user. The VC
allows Chameleon Cache to make additional use of the multiple mappings RSCs
provide to translate addresses to cache set indices: when a cache line is
evicted from the RSC to the VC under one of its mappings, the VC automatically
reinserts this evicted line back into the RSC by using a different mapping. As
a result, the effects of previous RSC set contention are hidden and Chameleon
Cache exhibits side-channel resistance and eviction patterns similar to fully
associative caches with random replacement. We show that Chameleon Cache has
performance overheads of < 1% and stress that VCs are more generically helpful
to increase side-channel resistance and re-keying intervals of randomized

images of M104 obtained with the CFHT/MegaCam, we detect a large number of
globular clusters (GCs) found out to $R\approx35'$ ($\sim100$ kpc). The color
distribution of these GCs shows two subpopulations: a blue (metal-poor) system
and a red (metal-rich) system. The total number of GCs is estimated to be
$N_{GC}=1610\pm30$ and the specific frequency to be $S_{N}=1.8\pm0.1$. The
radial number density profile of the GCs is steep in the inner region at
$R<20'$, and becomes shallow in the outer region at $20'<R<35'$. The outer
region is dominated by blue GCs and is extended out to $R\approx35'$. This
shows clearly the existence of a giant metal-poor halo in M104. The inner
region is composed of a bulge hosting a disk, corresponding to a metal-rich
halo as seen in early-type galaxies. At least two clumps of blue GCs are found
in the outer region. One clump is overlapped with a faint stellar stream
located in the south west, indicating that it may be a remnant of a disrupted
dwarf galaxy. Our results imply that the metal-rich inner halo of M104 formed
first via major mergers, and the metal-poor outer halo grew via numerous minor
mergers.

concentrations of cellular components such as ribosomes and proteins. These
concentrations continuously fluctuate over time and are inherited from mother

across generations. Division sizes of cells are also stochastic and correlated
across generations due to a phenomenon known as cell size regulation.
Fluctuations and correlations from both growth and division processes affect
the population dynamics of an exponentially growing culture. Here, we provide
analytic solutions for the population dynamics of cells with continuously
fluctuating growth rates coupled with a generic model of cell-size regulation.
We show that in balanced growth, the effects of growth and division processes
decouple; the population growth rate only depends on the single-cell growth
rate process, and the population cell size distribution only depends on the
model of division and cell size regulation. The population growth rate is
always higher than the average single-cell growth rate, and the difference
increases with growth rate variability and its correlation time. This
difference also sets the timescale for the population to reach its steady
state. We provide analytical solutions for oscillations in population growth
rate and traveling waves in size distribution during this approach to the

fault-tolerant distributed computing since it abstracts a broad set of problems
requiring processes to uniformly deliver messages in the same order in which
they were sent. Existing solutions (that tolerate process failures) reduce the
total-order broadcast problem to the one of multivalued consensus.
  Our study aims at the design of an even more reliable solution. We do so
through the lenses of self-stabilization-a very strong notion of fault
tolerance. In addition to node and communication failures, self-stabilizing
algorithms can recover after the occurrence of arbitrary transient faults;
these faults represent any violation of the assumptions according to which the
system was designed to operate (as long as the algorithm code stays intact).
  This work proposes the first (to the best of our knowledge) self-stabilizing
algorithm for total-order (uniform reliable) broadcast for asynchronous
message-passing systems prone to process failures and transient faults. As we
show, the proposed solution facilitates the elegant construction of
self-stabilizing state-machine replication using bounded memory.

moderately volatile element K can be outgassed from a magma ocean into
H$_2$-dominated primordial atmospheres of protoplanets with assumed masses
between 0.55-1.0$ M_{\rm Earth}$ at the time when the gas disk evaporated. We
estimate this outgassing and let these planets grow through impacts of depleted

carbonaceous chondrites until the growing protoplanets reach 1.0 $M_{\rm

pressure and temperature, calculate the proportion of K by Gibbs Free Energy
minimisation using the GGChem code. We find that for H$_2$-envelopes and for
magma ocean surface temperatures that are $\ge$ 2500 K, no K condensates are
thermally stable, so that outgassed $^{40}$K can populate the atmosphere to a
great extent. However, due to magma ocean turn-over time and the limited
diffusion of $^{40}$K into the upper atmosphere, from the entire $^{40}$K in
the magma ocean only a fraction may be available for escaping into space. The
escape rates of the primordial atmospheres and the dragged $^{40}$K are further
simulated for different stellar EUV-activities with a multispecies hydrodynamic
upper atmosphere evolution model. Our results lead to different abundances of
heat producing elements within the fully grown planets which may give rise to
different thermal and tectonic histories of terrestrial planets and their

consensus even when operating within unreliable directed networks. This
strategy, apart from handling time-varying delays induced by retransmissions of

well), can also handle packet drops that occur when exceeding a predefined

feedback signals to initially acquire or later update their out-degree, (b)
know whether a packet has arrived or not, and (c) determine a local upper-bound

of pixels and their grey/color values. The aim in the iterative approach is to
allow the change of the data dynamically during the inpainting process for a
reconstruction of the image that includes the enhancement and denoising
effects. The governing PDE model of this approach is a fully parabolic problem
where the set of stored pixels is time dependent. We consider the semi-discrete
dynamical system associated to the model which gives rise to an iterative
method where the stored data are modified during the iterations for best
outcomes. Finding the compression sets follows from a shape-based analysis
within the $\Gamma$-convergence tools, in particular well suited topological
asymptotic and a ``fat pixels'' approach are considered to obtain an analytic
characterization of the optimal sets in the sense of shape optimization theory.
We perform the analysis and derive several iterative algorithms that we
implement and compare to obtain the most efficient strategies of compression
and inpainting for noisy images. Some numerical computations are presented to
confirm the theoretical findings. Finally, we propose a modified model that

paper, we present an investigation on beamforming in an IRS-aided directional
modulation (DM) network. To fully explore the advantages of IRS, two
beamforming methods with enhanced secrecy rate (SR) performance are proposed.
The first method of maximizing secrecy rate (Max-SR) alternately optimizes
confidential message (CM) beamforming vector, artificial noise (AN) beamforming
vector and phase shift matrix. The first optimization vector is directly
computed by the Rayleigh ratio and the last two are solved with generalized
power iteration (GPI). This method is called Max-SR-GPI. To reduce the
computational complexity, a new method of maximizing receive power with
zero-forcing constraint (Max-RP-ZFC) of only reflecting CM and no AN is
proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed two methods harvest about
30 percent rate gains over the cases of random-phase IRS and no IRS, and the
proposed Max-SR-GPI performs slightly better than the Max-RP-ZFC in terms of
SR, particularly in the small-large IRS.

of nanospintronic technology. Here, it is proposed that the Rashba
spin-splitting can be turned on and off by reversing electric-field direction.
By the first-principle calculations, our proposal is illustrated by a concrete
example of Janus monolayer RbKNaBi. The designed RbKNaBi possesses dynamical,
thermal and mechanical stability, and is a large-gap quantum spin Hall
insulator (QSHI) with Rashba spin-splitting near the Fermi level. A small
built-in electric field is predicted due to very small electronegativity
difference between the bottom and top atoms, which is very key to switch Rashba
spin-splitting through the experimentally available electric field intensity.
Due to out-of-plane structural asymmetry, the Janus monolayer has distinctive
behaviors by applying external electric field $E$ with the same magnitude but
different directions ($z$ or $-z$). Our results reveal that the Rashba energy
($E_R$) and Rashba constant ($\alpha_R$) are increased by the positive $E$,
while a negative $E$ suppresses the Rashba splitting to disappear, and then
appears again. In a certain $E$ region (0.15 $\mathrm{V/\AA}$ to 0.25
$\mathrm{V/\AA}$), switching Rashba spin-splitting can be achieved by only
reversing electric-field direction. Besides, the piezoelectric strain
coefficients $d_{11}$ and $d_{31}$ (5.52 pm/V and -0.41 pm/V) are predicted,
which are higher than or compared with those of many 2D materials. By
piezoelectric effect, the strain can also be used to tune Rashba spin-splitting
of RbKNaBi. Moreover, a possible spintronic device is proposed to realize the
function of spintronic switch.

days to $\sim 330$ days after the explosion. This SN Ia is characterized by
extremely fast expansion at early times, with initial velocities of Si II and
Ca II being above ~ 25,000--30,000 km/s. After experiencing an unusually rapid
velocity decay, the ejecta velocity dropped to ~ 13,000 km/s around maximum
light. Photometrically, SN 2019ein has a moderate post-peak decline rate
($\Delta m_{15}(B) = 1.35 \pm 0.01$ mag), while being fainter than normal SNe
Ia by about 40% (with $M^{\rm max}_{B} \approx -18.71 \pm 0.15$ mag). The
nickel mass synthesized in the explosion is estimated to be 0.27--0.31
$M_{\odot}$ from the bolometric light curve. Given such a low nickel mass and a
relatively high photospheric velocity, we propose that SN 2019ein likely had a
sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (WD) progenitor, $M_{\rm WD} \lesssim 1.22
M_{\odot}$. In this case, the explosion could have been triggered by a
double-detonation mechanism, for which 1- and 2-dimensional models with WD mass
$M_{\rm WD} \approx 1 M_\odot$ and a helium shell of 0.01 $M_{\odot}$ can
reasonably produce the observed bolometric light curve and spectra. The
predicted asymmetry as a result of double detonation is also favored by the
redshifted Fe II and Ni II lines observed in the nebular-phase spectrum.
Possible diversity in origin of high velocity SNe Ia is also discussed.

emerging and challenging area with many potential applications from model
inspection, to neural architecture search or knowledge distillation. Recently,
an autoencoder trained on a model zoo was able to learn a hyper-representation,
which captures intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the models in the zoo. In
this work, we extend hyper-representations for generative use to sample new
model weights. We propose layer-wise loss normalization which we demonstrate is
key to generate high-performing models and several sampling methods based on
the topology of hyper-representations. The models generated using our methods
are diverse, performant and capable to outperform strong baselines as evaluated
on several downstream tasks: initialization, ensemble sampling and transfer
learning. Our results indicate the potential of knowledge aggregation from
model zoos to new models via hyper-representations thereby paving the avenue
for novel research directions.

generating graphs with categorical node and edge attributes. Our model utilizes
a discrete diffusion process that progressively edits graphs with noise,
through the process of adding or removing edges and changing the categories. A
graph transformer network is trained to revert this process, simplifying the
problem of distribution learning over graphs into a sequence of node and edge
classification tasks. We further improve sample quality by introducing a
Markovian noise model that preserves the marginal distribution of node and edge
types during diffusion, and by incorporating auxiliary graph-theoretic
features. A procedure for conditioning the generation on graph-level features
is also proposed. DiGress achieves state-of-the-art performance on molecular
and non-molecular datasets, with up to 3x validity improvement on a planar
graph dataset. It is also the first model to scale to the large GuacaMol
dataset containing 1.3M drug-like molecules without the use of
molecule-specific representations.

generalization (DG) leverages multiple source domains to learn a model that
generalizes well to unseen domains. However, existing DG methods generally
suffer from overfitting to the source domains, partly due to the limited
coverage of the expected region in feature space. Motivated by this, we propose
to perform mixup with data interpolation and extrapolation to cover the
potential unseen regions. To prevent the detrimental effects of unconstrained
extrapolation, we carefully design a policy to generate the instance weights,
named Flatness-aware Gradient-based Mixup (FGMix). The policy employs a
gradient-based similarity to assign greater weights to instances that carry
more invariant information, and learns the similarity function towards flatter
minima for better generalization. On the DomainBed benchmark, we validate the
efficacy of various designs of FGMix and demonstrate its superiority over other

Occasionally, if one of the elements is volatile at the growth temperature,
stoichiometry control can be greatly simplified using adsorption-controlled

to achieving high quality MEO film growths. Here, we report another kind of

approaches have seized considerable attention for different purposes like
assisted living. Temporal redundancy and the sheer size of raw videos are the
two most common problematic issues related to video processing algorithms. Most
of the existing methods mainly focused on increasing accuracy by exploring
consecutive frames, which is laborious and cannot be considered for real-time
applications. Since videos are mostly stored and transmitted in compressed
format, these kinds of videos are available on many devices. Compressed videos
contain a multitude of beneficial information, such as motion vectors and
quantized coefficients. Proper use of this available information can greatly
improve the video understanding methods' performance. This paper presents an
approach for using residual data, available in compressed videos directly,
which can be obtained by a light partially decoding procedure. In addition, a
method for accumulating similar residuals is proposed, which dramatically
reduces the number of processed frames for action recognition. Applying neural
networks exclusively for accumulated residuals in the compressed domain
accelerates performance, while the classification results are highly
competitive with raw video approaches.

from the introduced AMC, without which it vanishes. Our work paves the way for

for a large scale linear system of ODEs arising from the semi-discretization of
the heat equation combined with a linear algebraic output equation. In a first
step we approximate the non time-invariant system of ODEs by a linear
time-invariant system. Then we apply Lyapunov balanced truncation model order
reduction to approximate the output by a reduced-order system with only a few

results of extensive numerical experiments showing the efficiency of the

vital role for a reliable diagnosis. Existing studies have focused on specific
restoration problems such as image deblurring, denoising, and exposure
correction where there is usually a strong assumption on the artifact type and
severity. As a pioneer study in blind X-ray restoration, we propose a joint
model for generic image restoration and classification: Restore-to-Classify
Generative Adversarial Networks (R2C-GANs). Such a jointly optimized model
keeps any disease intact after the restoration. Therefore, this will naturally
lead to a higher diagnosis performance thanks to the improved X-ray image
quality. To accomplish this crucial objective, we define the restoration task
as an Image-to-Image translation problem from poor quality having noisy,
blurry, or over/under-exposed images to high quality image domain. The proposed
R2C-GAN model is able to learn forward and inverse transforms between the two
domains using unpaired training samples. Simultaneously, the joint
classification preserves the disease label during restoration. Moreover, the
R2C-GANs are equipped with operational layers/neurons reducing the network
depth and further boosting both restoration and classification performances.
The proposed joint model is extensively evaluated over the QaTa-COV19 dataset
for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) classification. The proposed
restoration approach achieves over 90% F1-Score which is significantly higher
than the performance of any deep model. Moreover, in the qualitative analysis,
the restoration performance of R2C-GANs is approved by a group of medical
doctors. We share the software implementation at

surfaces. Starting from the observed phenomena of spectral lines with widths
much larger than thermal broadening (e.g. micro- and macroturbulence) to the
detection of stochastic low-frequency variability (SLFV) in the Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite photometry, these stars clearly have large scale
turbulent motions on their surfaces. The cause of this turbulence is debated,
with near-surface convection zones, core internal gravity waves, and wind
variability being proposed. Our 3D grey radiation hydrodynamic (RHD) models
characterized the surfaces' convective dynamics driven by near-surface
convection zones and provided a reasonable match to the observed SLFV in the
most luminous massive stars. We now explore the complex emitting surfaces of
these 3D RHD models, which strongly violate the 1D assumption of a plane
parallel atmosphere. By post-processing the grey RHD models with the Monte
Carlo radiation transport code SEDONA, we synthesize stellar spectra and
extract information from the broadening of individual photospheric lines. The
use of SEDONA enables the calculation of the viewing angle and temporal
dependence of spectral absorption line profiles. Combining uncorrelated
temporal snapshots together, we compare the broadening from the 3D RHD models'
velocity fields to the thermal broadening of the extended emitting region,
showing that our synthesized spectral lines closely resemble the observed
macroturbulent broadening from similarly luminous stars. More generally, the
new techniques we have developed will allow for systematic studies of the
origin of turbulent velocity broadening from any future 3D simulations.

zero-point energy and anharmonicity are included in the calculations.
Anharmonicity is crucial in palladium hydrides when hydrogen atoms occupy
octahedral sites and, in fact, makes the structure with full octahedral

integrating general-purpose processors (GPPs) and neural processing units

applications built using a variety of machine learning models. We propose a
real-time scheduler, called PRISM, which can schedule machine learning models
on a heterogeneous NSoC either individually or concurrently to improve their
system performance. PRISM consists of the following four key steps. First, it
constructs an interprocessor communication (IPC) graph of a machine learning
model from a mapping and a self-timed schedule. Second, it creates a
transaction order for the communication actors and embeds this order into the
IPC graph. Third, it schedules the graph on an NSoC by overlapping
communication with the computation. Finally, it uses a Hill Climbing heuristic
to explore the design space of mapping operations on GPPs and NPUs to improve
the performance. Unlike existing schedulers which use only the NPUs of an NSoC,
PRISM improves performance by enabling batch, pipeline, and operation
parallelism via exploiting a platform's heterogeneity. For use-cases with
concurrent applications, PRISM uses a heuristic resource sharing strategy and a
non-preemptive scheduling to reduce the expected wait time before concurrent
operations can be scheduled on contending resources. Our extensive evaluations
with 20 machine learning workloads show that PRISM significantly improves the
performance per watt for both individual applications and use-cases when
compared to state-of-the-art schedulers.

overfitting and improves generalization by increasing the margin between the
training samples and the decision boundary.

when we are back at a location we have seen before, and can even conceive of

Current methods in model-based reinforcement learning on the other hand
struggle with generalizing about environment dynamics out of the training
distribution. We argue that two principles can help bridge this gap: latent
learning and parsimonious dynamics. Humans tend to think about environment
dynamics in simple terms -- we reason about trajectories not in reference to
what we expect to see along a path, but rather in an abstract latent space,
containing information about the places' spatial coordinates. Moreover, we
assume that moving around in novel parts of our environment works the same way
as in parts we are familiar with. These two principles work together in tandem:
it is in the latent space that the dynamics show parsimonious characteristics.
We develop a model that learns such parsimonious dynamics. Using a variational
objective, our model is trained to reconstruct experienced transitions in a
latent space using locally linear transformations, while encouraged to invoke
as few distinct transformations as possible. Using our framework, we
demonstrate the utility of learning parsimonious latent dynamics models in a
range of policy learning and planning tasks.

variational autoencoder (VAE) often play antagonistic roles, and tuning the
weight of the KLD loss in $\beta$-VAE to achieve a balance between the two
losses is a tricky and dataset-specific task. As a result, current practices in
VAE training often result in a trade-off between the reconstruction fidelity
and the continuity$/$disentanglement of the latent space, if the weight $\beta$
is not carefully tuned. In this paper, we present intuitions and a careful
analysis of the antagonistic mechanism of the two losses, and propose, based on
the insights, a simple yet effective two-stage method for training a VAE.
Specifically, the method aggregates a learned Gaussian posterior $z \sim
q_{\theta} (z|x)$ with a decoder decoupled from the KLD loss, which is trained
to learn a new conditional distribution $p_{\phi} (x|z)$ of the input data $x$.
Experimentally, we show that the aggregated VAE maximally satisfies the
Gaussian assumption about the latent space, while still achieves a
reconstruction error comparable to when the latent space is only loosely
regularized by $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},I)$. The proposed approach does not
require hyperparameter (i.e., the KLD weight $\beta$) tuning given a specific
dataset as required in common VAE training practices. We evaluate the method
using a medical dataset intended for 3D skull reconstruction and shape
completion, and the results indicate promising generative capabilities of the
VAE trained using the proposed method. Besides, through guided manipulation of
the latent variables, we establish a connection between existing autoencoder

neural network FarNet was developed to improve these detections. Aims. We aim
to create a new machine learning tool, FarNet II, which further increases the
scope of FarNet, and to evaluate its performance in comparison to FarNet and
the standard helioseismic method for detecting far side activity. Methods. We
developed FarNet II, a neural network that retains some of the general
characteristics of FarNet but improves the detections in general, as well as
the temporal coherence among successive predictions. The main novelties are the
implementation of attention and convolutional long short term memory (ConvLSTM)
modules. A cross validation approach, training the network 37 times with a
different validation set for each run, was employed to leverage the limited
amount of data available. We evaluate the performance of FarNet II using three
years of extreme ultraviolet observations of the far side of the Sun acquired
with the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) as a proxy of
activity. The results from FarNet II were compared with those obtained from
FarNet and the standard helioseismic method using the Dice coefficient as a
metric. Results. FarNet II achieves a Dice coefficient that improves that of
FarNet by over 0.2 points for every output position on the sequences from the
evaluation dates. Its improvement over FarNet is higher than that of FarNet
over the standard method. Conclusions. The new network is a very promising tool
for improving the detection of activity on the far side of the Sun given by
pure helioseismic techniques. Space weather forecasts can potentially benefit
from the higher sensitivity provided by this novel method.

combinations of features, or principal components (PCs), that explain the

this involves solving a sparsity and orthogonality constrained convex

existing work address sparse PCA via heuristics such as iteratively computing
one sparse PC and deflating the covariance matrix, which does not guarantee the
orthogonality, let alone the optimality, of the resulting solution. We
challenge this status by reformulating the orthogonality conditions as rank
constraints and optimizing over the sparsity and rank constraints
simultaneously. We design tight semidefinite relaxations and propose tractable
second-order cone versions of these relaxations which supply high-quality upper
bounds. We also design valid second-order cone inequalities which hold when
each PC's individual sparsity is specified, and demonstrate that these
inequalities tighten our relaxations significantly. Moreover, we propose exact
methods and rounding mechanisms that exploit these relaxations' tightness to
obtain solutions with a bound gap on the order of 1%-5% for real-world datasets

  Concerning random maps, we first obtain the distribution of the degree of the

Our main result is a limiting map-Airy distribution law for the size of the
largest block $L$, whose expectation is asymptotically $n/\sqrt{3}$ in a random
cubic map with $n+2$ faces. We prove analogous results for the size of the
largest cubic block, obtained from $L$ by erasing all vertices of degree two,

difficult problems in quantum chemistry. In this paper, we propose a new
classical quantum hybrid method, named as power of sine Hamiltonian operator
(PSHO), to evaluate the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian (H). In PSHO, for
any reference state, the normalized energy of the sine Hamiltonian power state
can be determined. With the increase of the power, the initial reference state
can converge to the eigenstate with the largest absolute eigenvalue in the
coefficients of the expansion of reference state, and the normalized energy of
the sine Hamiltonian power state converges to Ei. The ground and excited state
energies of a Hamiltonian can be determined by taking different t values. The
performance of the PSHO method is demonstrated by numerical calculations of the
H4 and LiH molecules. Compared with the current popular variational quantum
eigensolver method, PSHO does not need to design the ansatz circuits and avoids
the complex nonlinear optimization problems. PSHO has great application
potential in near term quantum devices.

turbulent dynamos, allowing the growth of large-scale magnetic fields while
overcoming catastrophic quenching. We show here, analytically, how several
important types of magnetic helicity fluxes can arise from terms involving
triple correlators of fluctuating fields in the helicity density evolution
equation. For this, we assume incompressibility and weak inhomogeneity, and use
a quasinormal closure approximation: fourth-order correlators are replaced by
products of second-order ones, and the effect of the fourth-order cumulants on
the evolution of the third moments is modelled by a strong damping term. First,
we show how a diffusive helicity flux, till now only measured in simulations,
arises from the triple correlation term. This is accompanied by what we refer
to as a `random advective flux', which predominantly transports magnetic
helicity along the gradients of the random fields. We also find that a new
helicity flux contribution, in some aspects similar to that first proposed by
Vishniac, can arise from the triple correlator. This contribution depends on
the gradients of the random magnetic and kinetic energies along the large-scale
vorticity, and thus arises in any rotating, stratified system, even if the
turbulence is predominantly nonhelical. It can source a large-scale dynamo by
itself while spatially transporting magnetic helicity within the system.

two-dimensional topological boundary states for implementing synthetic magnetic
flux of ultracold atoms trapped in bilayer optical lattices, which includes
Chern insulator, Dirac semimetals, and second-order topological phase (SOTP) by
the interplay of the two-photon detuning and effective Zeeman shift. These
observed topological phases can be well characterized by the energy gap of
bulk, Wilson loop spectra, and the spin textures at the higher symmetric points
of system. We show that the SOTP exhibits a pair of $0$D boundary states. While
the phases of Dirac semimetals and Chern insulator support the conventional
$1$D boundary states due to the principle of bulk-boundary correspondence.
Strikingly, the emerged boundary states for Dirac semimetals and SOTP are
topologically protected by $\cal P T$-symmetry and chiral-mirror symmetry
($\mathcal{\widetilde{M}}_{\alpha}$), respectively. In particular, the location
of $0$D corner states for SOTP which are associated with existing
$\mathcal{\widetilde{M}}_{\alpha}$-symmetry can be highly manipulated by tuning
magnetic flux. Our scheme herein provides a platform for emerging exotic

important observational issues in modern cosmology and also may provide a
solution to current cosmological tensions. Since the phenomenology of the dark
sector could be extremely rich, one should not restrict the interacting models
to have a coupling parameter which is constant in cosmic time, rather allow for
its dynamical behavior, as it is common practice in the literature when dealing
with other dark energy properties, as the dark energy equation of state. We
present here a compendium of the current cosmological constraints on a large
variety of interacting models, investigating scenarios where the coupling
parameter of the interaction function and the dark energy equation of state can
be either constant or dynamical. For the most general schemes, in which both
the coupling parameter of the interaction function and the dark energy equation
of state are dynamical, we find $95\%$~CL evidence for a dark energy component
at early times and slightly milder evidence for a dynamical dark coupling for
the most complete observational data set exploited here, which includes CMB,
BAO and Supernova Ia measurements. Interestingly, there are some cases where a
dark energy component different from the cosmological constant case at early
times together with a coupling different from zero today, can alleviate both
the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tension for the full dataset combination considered here.
Due to the energy exchange among the dark sectors, the current values of the
matter energy density and of the clustering parameter $\sigma_8$ are shifted
from their $\Lambda$CDM-like values. This fact makes future surveys, especially
those focused on weak lensing measurements, unique tools to test the nature and
the couplings of the dark energy sector.

conditioning under the introduction of symmetry priors. In particular, SymmNeRF
takes the pixel-aligned image features and the corresponding symmetric features
as extra inputs to the NeRF, whose parameters are generated by a hypernetwork.
As the parameters are conditioned on the image-encoded latent codes, SymmNeRF
is thus scene-independent and can generalize to new scenes. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that SymmNeRF synthesizes novel views
with more details regardless of the pose transformation, and demonstrates good
generalization when applied to unseen objects. Code is available at:

their weak sensitivity to the choice of noise family and the role of adequate
scheduling of noise levels for good synthesis. By identifying a correspondence
between diffusion models and a well-known paradigm in cognitive science known

important criterion is the safety of the human operator interacting with a high
degree of freedom (DoF) robot. Therefore, a robust control scheme is in high
demand to establish safe pHRI and stabilize nonlinear, high DoF systems. In
this paper, an adaptive decentralized control strategy is designed to
accomplish the abovementioned objectives. To do so, a human upper limb model
and an exoskeleton model are decentralized and augmented at the subsystem level
to enable a decentralized control action design. Moreover, human exogenous
force (HEF) that can resist exoskeleton motion is estimated using radial basis
function neural networks (RBFNNs). Estimating both human upper limb and robot
rigid body parameters, along with HEF estimation, makes the controller
adaptable to different operators, ensuring their physical safety. The barrier
Lyapunov function (BLF) is employed to guarantee that the robot can operate in
a safe workspace while ensuring stability by adjusting the control law. Unknown
actuator uncertainty and constraints are also considered in this study to
ensure a smooth and safe pHRI. Then, the asymptotic stability of the whole
system is established by means of the virtual stability concept and virtual
power flows (VPFs) under the proposed robust controller. The experimental
results are presented and compared to proportional-derivative (PD) and
proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. To show the robustness of
the designed controller and its good performance, experiments are performed at
different velocities, with different human users, and in the presence of
unknown disturbances. The proposed controller showed perfect performance in
controlling the robot, whereas PD and PID controllers could not even ensure
stable motion in the wrist joints of the robot.

discovering new effects, developing numerous applications, and identifying
promising new directions. This includes magnonics, an emerging research field
oriented on the study of spin-wave dynamics and their applications. In this
context, thin ferromagnetic films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA)
offer interesting opportunities to study spin waves, in particular, due to
out-of-plane magnetization in remanence or at relatively weak external magnetic
fields. This is the only magnetization configuration offering isotropic
in-plane spin-wave propagation within the sample plane, the forward volume
magnetostatic spin-wave geometry. The isotropic dispersion relation is highly
important in designing signal-processing devices, offering superior prospects
for direct replicating various concepts from photonics into magnonics.
Analogous to photonic or phononic crystals, which are the building blocks of
optoelectronics and phononics, magnonic crystals are considered as key
components in magnonics applications. Arrays of nanodots and structured
ferromagnetic thin films with a periodic array of holes, popularly known as
antidot lattices based on PMA multilayers have been recently studied. Novel
magnonic properties related to propagating spin-wave modes, exploitation of the

optimization problems of community detection (CD). Due to the NP-hardness, to
balance the CD quality and efficiency remains a challenge. Most existing CD
methods are transductive, which are independently optimized only for the CD on
a single graph. Some of these methods use advanced machine learning techniques
to obtain high-quality CD results but usually have high complexity. Other
approaches use fast heuristic approximation to ensure low runtime but may
suffer from quality degradation. In contrast to these transductive methods, we
propose an alternative inductive community detection (ICD) method across graphs
of a system or scenario to alleviate the NP-hard challenge. ICD first conducts
the offline training of an adversarial dual GNN on historical graphs to capture
key properties of the system. The trained model is then directly generalized to
new unseen graphs for online CD without additional optimization, where a better
trade-off between quality and efficiency can be achieved. ICD can also capture
the permutation invariant community labels in the offline training and tackle
the online CD on new graphs with non-fixed number of nodes and communities.
Experiments on a set of benchmarks demonstrate that ICD can achieve a
significant trade-off between quality and efficiency over various baselines.

parameters of target model, largely exacerbating the threats of deployed deep
neural networks (DNNs). However, previous works state that black-box attacks
fail to mislead target models when their training data and outputs are
inaccessible. In this work, we argue that black-box attacks can pose practical
attacks in this extremely restrictive scenario where only several test samples
are available. Specifically, we find that attacking the shallow layers of DNNs
trained on a few test samples can generate powerful adversarial examples. As
only a few samples are required, we refer to these attacks as lightweight
black-box attacks. The main challenge to promoting lightweight attacks is to
mitigate the adverse impact caused by the approximation error of shallow
layers. As it is hard to mitigate the approximation error with few available
samples, we propose Error TransFormer (ETF) for lightweight attacks. Namely,
ETF transforms the approximation error in the parameter space into a
perturbation in the feature space and alleviates the error by disturbing
features. In experiments, lightweight black-box attacks with the proposed ETF
achieve surprising results. For example, even if only 1 sample per category
available, the attack success rate in lightweight black-box attacks is only
about 3% lower than that of the black-box attacks with complete training data.

at bridging these gaps and developing a deeper understanding of AdaGrad and its
variants in the standard setting of smooth convex functions as well as the more
general setting of quasar convex functions. First, we demonstrate new
techniques to explicitly bound the convergence rate of the vanilla AdaGrad for
unconstrained problems in both deterministic and stochastic settings. Second,
we propose a variant of AdaGrad for which we can show the convergence of the
last iterate, instead of the average iterate. Finally, we give new accelerated

ground-based spectroscopic and radial velocity observations from the CORALIE

trend of high host star metallicity for giant planets and does not bolster

Nowadays, the most efficient strategy to describe optical spectra of solids in

model the rank-1 components of the low-rank CP decomposition of a matrix object

tensor-decomposition based matrix factor model (TeDFaM) are apparently more
informative in that it naturally incorporates the row-wise and column-wise
interrelated information. Furthermore, the inner separable covariance structure
yields efficient moment estimators of the loading matrices and thus approximate
least squares estimators for the factor scores. The proposed TeDFaM model and
estimation procedure make the signal part achieves better peak signal to noise
ratio, evidenced in both theory and numerical analytics compared to bilinear
form matrix factor models and existing methods. We establish an inferential
theory for TeDFaM estimation including consistency, rates of convergence, and
the limiting distributions under regular conditions. In applications, the
proposed model and estimation procedure are superior in terms of matrix
reconstruction for both independent two-dimensional image data and serial
correlated matrix time series. The algorithm is fast and can be implemented
expediently through an accompanied R package TeDFaM.

rotor size in order to capture more power. This leads to taller, slender and
more flexible towers, which thus experience higher dynamical loads due to the
turbine rotation and environmental factors. It is hence compelling to deploy
advanced control methods that can dynamically counteract such loads, especially
at tower positions that are more prone to develop cracks or corrosion damages.
Still, to the best of the authors' knowledge, little to no attention has been
paid in the literature to load mitigation at multiple tower locations.
Furthermore, there is a need for control schemes that can balance load
reduction with optimization of power production. In this paper, we develop an
Economic Model Predictive Control (eMPC) framework to address such needs.
First, we develop a linear modal model to account for the tower flexural
dynamics. Then we incorporate it into an eMPC framework, where the dynamics of
the turbine rotation are expressed in energy terms. This allows us to obtain a
convex formulation, that is computationally attractive. Our control law is
designed to avoid the 'turn-pike' behavior and guarantee recursive feasibility.
We demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller on a 5MW reference WT
model: the results illustrate that the proposed controller is able to reduce
the tower loads at multiple locations, without significant effects to the
generated power.

distributed models at a central solver to achieve a more powerful model.
However, this would incur severe communication burden between a server and
multiple clients especially when data distributions are heterogeneous. As a
result, current federated learning methods often require a large number of
communication rounds in training. Unlike existing paradigms, we introduce an
alternative perspective to significantly decrease the communication cost in
federate learning. In this work, we first introduce a meta knowledge
representation method that extracts meta knowledge from distributed clients.
The extracted meta knowledge encodes essential information that can be used to
improve the current model. As the training progresses, the contributions of
training samples to a federated model also vary. Thus, we introduce a dynamic
weight assignment mechanism that enables samples to contribute adaptively to
the current model update. Then, informative meta knowledge from all active
clients is sent to the server for model update. Training a model on the
combined meta knowledge without exposing original data among different clients
can significantly mitigate the heterogeneity issues. Moreover, to further
ameliorate data heterogeneity, we also exchange meta knowledge among clients as
conditional initialization for local meta knowledge extraction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
method. Remarkably, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large
margin (from $74.07\%$ to $92.95\%$) on MNIST with a restricted communication

highly complex protein-protein interactions. Nevertheless, it has been
suggested that based on the extended law of corresponding states (ELCS), as
proposed for colloids with short-range attractions, one can rationalize not
only the thermodynamics, but also the structure and dynamics of such systems.
This claim is systematically and comprehensively tested here by static and
dynamic light scattering experiments. Spinodal lines, the isothermal osmotic
compressibility $\kappa_\text{T}$ and the relaxation rate of concentration
fluctuations $\Gamma$ are determined for protein solutions in the vicinity of
LLPS. All these quantities are found to exhibit a corresponding-states
behavior. This means that, for different solution conditions, these quantities
are essentially the same if considered at similar reduced temperature or second
virial coefficient. For moderately concentrated solutions, the volume fraction
$\phi$ dependence of $\kappa_\text{T}$ and $\Gamma$ can be consistently
described by Baxter's model of adhesive hard spheres. The off-critical,
asymptotic $T$ behavior of $\kappa_\text{T}$ and $\Gamma$ close to LLPS is
consistent with the scaling laws predicted by mean-field theory. Thus, the
present work aims at a comprehensive experimental test of the applicability of
the ELCS to structural and dynamical properties of concentrated protein
solutions.

non-convex stochastic optimization problems. In this setting, the recent work
STORM [Cutkosky-Orabona '19] overcomes the drawback of having to compute
gradients of ""mega-batches"" that earlier VR methods rely on. There, STORM
utilizes recursive momentum to achieve the VR effect and is then later made
fully adaptive in STORM+ [Levy et al., '21], where full-adaptivity removes the
requirement for obtaining certain problem-specific parameters such as the
smoothness of the objective and bounds on the variance and norm of the
stochastic gradients in order to set the step size. However, STORM+ crucially
relies on the assumption that the function values are bounded, excluding a
large class of useful functions. In this work, we propose META-STORM, a
generalized framework of STORM+ that removes this bounded function values
assumption while still attaining the optimal convergence rate for non-convex
optimization. META-STORM not only maintains full-adaptivity, removing the need
to obtain problem specific parameters, but also improves the convergence rate's
dependency on the problem parameters. Furthermore, META-STORM can utilize a
large range of parameter settings that subsumes previous methods allowing for
more flexibility in a wider range of settings. Finally, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of META-STORM through experiments across common deep learning
tasks. Our algorithm improves upon the previous work STORM+ and is competitive

$O(\sqrt{{kd}/{T}})$ after $T$ iterations of SGD, which is independent of the

$\epsilon$ is the noise. This is in contrast to the known $d^{\Omega(p)}$
sample requirement to learn any degree $p$ polynomial in the kernel regime, and
it shows that NNs trained with SGD can outperform the neural tangent kernel at

without resorting to any localization of atomic interactions or other

ConvRNN-T takes advantage of causal 1-D convolutional layers,

promising candidate for on-device streaming ASR technologies.

on the interfacial dynamics and on the properties of the liquid film left
behind remain poorly understood. Here, we study the deposition of a coating
film on the walls of a capillary tube induced by the translation of a

a function of the translation speed of the plug, the particle size, and the
volume fraction of the suspension. The thickness of the coating film is
characterized, and we show that similarly to dip coating, three coating

unique environments. To this aim, recently [P.V.P. Cunha and C.A.R. Herdeiro,

dimensions; nevertheless, we prove that there is a light ring for each rotation
sense for a stationary black hole. We give the static and the Myers-Perry

route to alleviate scientists from tedious tasks while accelerating the process
of obtaining new materials, where topical issues such as climate change and
disease risks worldwide would greatly benefit. While some experimental
workflows can already benefit from automation, it is common that sample
preparation is still carried out manually due to the high level of motor
function required when dealing with heterogeneous systems, e.g., different
tools, chemicals, and glassware. A fundamental workflow in chemical fields is
crystallisation, where one application is polymorph screening, i.e., obtaining
a three dimensional molecular structure from a crystal. For this process, it is
of utmost importance to recover as much of the sample as possible since
synthesising molecules is both costly in time and money. To this aim, chemists
have to scrape vials to retrieve sample contents prior to imaging plate
transfer. Automating this process is challenging as it goes beyond robotic
insertion tasks due to a fundamental requirement of having to execute
fine-granular movements within a constrained environment that is the sample
vial. Motivated by how human chemists carry out this process of scraping powder
from vials, our work proposes a model-free reinforcement learning method for
learning a scraping policy, leading to a fully autonomous sample scraping
procedure. To realise that, we first create a simulation environment with a
Panda Franka Emika robot using a laboratory scraper which is inserted into a
simulated vial, to demonstrate how a scraping policy can be learned
successfully. We then evaluate our method on a real robotic manipulator in
laboratory settings, and show that our method can autonomously scrape powder

infinite) sequence of its words, without repetitions, while bounding the delay
between two consecutive words. To allow for delay bounds that do not depend on
the current word length, we assume a model where we produce each word by
editing the preceding word with a small edit script, rather than writing out
the word from scratch. In particular, this witnesses that the language is
orderable, i.e., we can write its words as an infinite sequence such that the
Levenshtein edit distance between any two consecutive words is bounded by a
value that depends only on the language. For instance, $(a+b)^*$ is orderable
(with a variant of the Gray code), but $a^* + b^*$ is not.
  We characterize which regular languages are enumerable in this sense, and
show that this can be decided in PTIME in an input deterministic finite
automaton (DFA) for the language. In fact, we show that, given a DFA $A$, we
can compute in PTIME automata $A_1, \ldots, A_t$ such that $L(A)$ is
partitioned as $L(A_1) \sqcup \ldots \sqcup L(A_t)$ and every $L(A_i)$ is
orderable in this sense. Further, we show that the value of $t$ obtained is
optimal, i.e., we cannot partition $L(A)$ into less than $t$ orderable
languages.
  In the case where $L(A)$ is orderable (i.e., $t=1$), we show that the
ordering can be produced by a bounded-delay algorithm: specifically, the
algorithm runs in a suitable pointer machine model, and produces a sequence of
bounded-length edit scripts to visit the words of $L(A)$ without repetitions,
with bounded delay -- exponential in $|A|$ -- between each script. In fact, we
show that we can achieve this while only allowing the edit operations push and
pop at the beginning and end of the word, which implies that the word can in
fact be maintained in a double-ended queue.

currently are heralding a next generation of computer systems that aims to suit
modern users' demands. Over the recent years, several technologies for
blockchains, off-chaining strategies, as well as decentralised and respectively
self-sovereign identity systems have shot up so fast that standardisation of
the protocols is lagging behind, severely hampering the interoperability of
different approaches. Moreover, most of the currently available solutions for
distributed ledgers focus on either home users or enterprise use case
scenarios, failing to provide integrative solutions addressing the needs of
both.
  Herein we introduce the OpenDSU platform that allows to interoperate generic
blockchain technologies, organised - and possibly cascaded in a hierarchical
fashion - in domains. To achieve this flexibility, we seamlessly integrated a
set of well conceived OpenDSU components to orchestrate off-chain data with
granularly resolved and cryptographically secure access levels that are nested
with sovereign identities across the different domains.
  Employing our platform to PharmaLedger, an inter-European network for the
standardisation of data handling in the pharmaceutical industry and in
healthcare, we demonstrate that OpenDSU can cope with generic demands of
heterogeneous use cases in both, performance and handling substantially
different business policies. Importantly, whereas available solutions commonly
require a pre-defined and fixed set of components, no such vendor lock-in
restrictions on the blockchain technology or identity system exist in OpenDSU,
making systems built on it flexibly adaptable to new standards evolving in the
future.

scalar particles with masses around $10^{-22} \mathrm{eV}/c^2$, a regime where
cold bosonic matter behaves as a collective wave rather than individual
particles. It has increasingly attracted attention due to its rich
phenomenology on astrophysical scales, with implications for the small-scale
tensions present within the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Although
constraints on FDM are accumulating in many different contexts, very few have
been verified by self-consistent numerical simulations. We present new large
numerical simulations of cosmic structure formation with FDM, solving the full
Schr\""odinger-Poisson (SP) equations using the AxiREPO code, which implements a
pseudo-spectral numerical method. Combined with our previous simulations, they
allow us to draw a four-way comparison of matter clustering, contrasting
results (such as power spectra) for each combination of initial conditions (FDM
vs. CDM) and dynamics (SP vs. $N$-body). By disentangling the impact of initial
conditions and non-linear dynamics, we can gauge the validity of approximate
methods used in previous works, such as ordinary $N$-body simulations with an
FDM initial power spectrum. Due to the comparatively large volume achieved in
our FDM simulations, we are able to measure the FDM halo mass function from
full wave simulations for the first time, and compare to previous results
obtained using analytic or approximate approaches. We find that, due to the
cut-off of small-scale power in the FDM power spectrum, haloes are linked via
continuous, smooth, and dense filaments throughout the entire simulation volume
(unlike for the standard $\Lambda$CDM power spectrum), posing significant
challenges for reliably identifying haloes. We also investigate the density
profiles of these filaments and compare to their CDM counterparts.

restoring force depends non-monotonically on the rate of diffusion of the
stress and the size of the object. We further show how the restoring force
depends on the relative orientation of the microscopic structure and the

software developers are increasingly sharing more coding solutions to

vulnerable code, which then can be reused into mission critical software
systems - making those systems vulnerable in the process. Collaborative editing

shared contents. Aim: In this paper, we investigate whether code editing can
mitigate shared vulnerable code examples by analyzing IoT code snippets and
their revisions in three Stack Exchange sites: Stack Overflow, Arduino, and
Raspberry Pi. Method:We analyze the vulnerabilities present in shared IoT C/C++
code snippets, as C/C++ is one of the most widely used languages in
mission-critical devices and low-powered IoT devices. We further analyse the
revisions made to these code snippets, and their effects. Results: We find
several vulnerabilities such as CWE 788 - Access of Memory Location After End
of Buffer, in 740 code snippets . However, we find the vast majority of posts
are not revised, or revisions are not made to the code snippets themselves (598
out of 740). We also find that revisions are most likely to result in no change
to the number of vulnerabilities in a code snippet rather than deteriorating or
improving the snippet. Conclusions: We conclude that the current collaborative
editing system in the forums may be insufficient to help mitigate
vulnerabilities in the shared code.

Thus, an accurate prediction of long-term air temperature may be valuable also

carried out this work is based on Reanalysis data, which are first processed by
a correlation analysis among different prediction variables and the target

the largest correlation is located, and the variables within, after a feature

The experiments carried out show a very good prediction skill in the three

leverages spectral domain representations. For the spatial domain approach, we
propose ResNet1D, a 1D CNN-based polygon encoder, which uses circular padding
to achieve loop origin invariance on simple polygons. For the spectral domain

amorphous counterparts. The degree of radio-resistance exhibited by crystalline
ice phases is dependent upon the nature, strength, and extent of the
intermolecular interactions that characterise their solid structure. For
example, it has been shown that crystalline CH3OH decays at a significantly
slower rate when irradiated by 2 keV electrons at 20 K than does the amorphous
phase due to the stabilising effect imparted by the presence of an extensive
array of strong hydrogen bonds. These results have important consequences for
the astrochemistry of interstellar ices and outer Solar System bodies, as they
imply that the chemical products arising from the irradiation of amorphous ices

abundant than those arising from similar irradiations of crystalline phases. In
this present study, we have extended our work on this subject by performing
comparative energetic electron irradiations of the amorphous and crystalline
phases of the sulphur-bearing molecules H2S and SO2 at 20 K. We have found
evidence for phase-dependent chemistry in both these species, with the
radiation-induced exponential decay of amorphous H2S being more rapid than that
of the crystalline phase, similar to the effect that has been previously
observed for CH3OH. For SO2, two fluence regimes are apparent: a low-fluence
regime in which the crystalline ice exhibits a rapid exponential decay while
the amorphous ice possibly resists decay, and a high-fluence regime in which
both phases undergo slow exponential-like decays.

ontologies have been proposed as a foundation to information management and
maintenance in presence of heterogeneous data sources. In addition, ontologies
provide reasoning and querying capabilities to aid domain experts and end users
in the context of constraint validation and decision making. Finally,
ontology-based approaches to advanced manufacturing services can support the
explainability and interpretability of the behaviour of monitoring, control,
and simulation systems that are based on black-box machine learning algorithms.
In this work, we provide a novel ontology for the classification of
process-induced defects known from the metal additive manufacturing literature.
Together with a formal representation of the characterising features and
sources of defects, we integrate our knowledge base with state-of-the-art
ontologies in the field. Our knowledge base aims at enhancing the modelling
capabilities of additive manufacturing ontologies by adding further defect
analysis terminology and diagnostic inference features.

nuclear physics. The basic input is an optical model potential, which describes
the refraction and absorption processes more or less schematically. Of special
interest is the form of the absorption potential. With increasing energy of the
incident projectile, a derivation of this potential must take into account the
observed energy dependent transition from surface to volume type. The classic
approach has weaknesses in this regard. We will discuss these deficiencies and
will propose an alternative method based on concepts developed within the
framework of fractional calculus, which allows to describe a smooth transition
from surface to volume absorption in an appropriate way.

  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2210.06256",,,,"physics.gen-ph hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In a long series of works the author has demonstrated that the model named
the {\it spin-charge-family} theory offers the explanation for all in the {\it
standard model} assumed properties of the fermion and boson fields, as well as
for many of their so far observed properties if the space-time is $\ge (13 +1)$
while fermions interact with gravity only. In this paper, I briefly report on
the so far achievements of the theory. The main contribution demonstrates the
offer of the Clifford odd and even objects for the description of the internal
spaces of fermion (Clifford odd) and boson (Clifford even) fields, which is
opening up a new understanding of the second quantization postulates for the
fermion and boson fields: The ""basis vectors"" determined by the Clifford odd
objects demonstrate all the properties of the internal space of fermions and
transfer their anticommutativity to their creation and annihilation operators,
while the ""basis vectors"" determined by the Clifford even objects demonstrate
all the properties of the internal space of boson fields and transfer their
commutativity to their creation and annihilation operators. The toy model with
$d=(5+1)$ illustrates the statements.

  molecules with attention pooling and Bayesian learning",,,,,"q-bio.BM cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In drug discovery, aqueous solubility is an important pharmacokinetic
property which affects absorption and assay availability of drug. Thus, in
silico prediction of solubility has been studied for its utility in virtual
screening and lead optimization. Recently, machine learning (ML) methods using
experimental data has been popular because physics-based methods like quantum
mechanics and molecular dynamics are not suitable for high-throughput tasks due
to its computational costs. However, ML method can exhibit over-fitting problem
in a data-deficient condition, and this is the case for most chemical property
datasets. In addition, ML methods are regarded as a black box function in that
it is difficult to interpret contribution of hidden features to outputs,
hindering analysis and modification of structure-activity relationship. To deal
with mentioned issues, we developed Bayesian graph neural networks (GNNs) with
the self-attention readout layer. Unlike most GNNs using self-attention in node
updates, self-attention applied at readout layer enabled a model to improve
prediction performance as well as to identify atom-wise importance, which can
help lead optimization as exemplified for three FDA-approved drugs. Also,
Bayesian inference enables us to separate more or less accurate results
according to uncertainty in solubility prediction task We expect that our
accurate, reliable and interpretable model can be used for more careful
decision-making and various applications in the development of drugs.

recommender systems in a federated learning (FL) framework, where multiple
parties collaboratively train a model without sharing their data. Most of these
studies assume that the conventional FL framework can fully protect user
privacy. However, there are serious privacy risks in matrix factorization in
federated recommender systems based on our study. This paper first provides a
rigorous theoretical analysis of the server reconstruction attack in four
scenarios in federated recommender systems, followed by comprehensive
experiments. The empirical results demonstrate that the FL server could infer
users' information with accuracy >80% based on the uploaded gradients from FL
nodes. The robustness analysis suggests that our reconstruction attack analysis
outperforms the random guess by >30% under Laplace noises with b no larger than
0.5 for all scenarios. Then, the paper proposes a new privacy-preserving
framework based on homomorphic encryption, Privacy-Preserving Multi-View Matrix
Factorization (PrivMVMF), to enhance user data privacy protection in federated
recommender systems. The proposed PrivMVMF is successfully implemented and
tested thoroughly with the MovieLens dataset.

online services and goods, especially with the increased use of the Internet to
access information and purchase products and services. This work proposes a
novel recommendation method based on complex networks generated by a
similarity-popularity model to predict ones. We first construct a model of a
network having users and items as nodes from observed ratings and then use it
to predict unseen ratings. The prospect of producing accurate rating
predictions using a similarity-popularity model with hidden metric spaces and
dot-product similarity is explored. The proposed approach is implemented and
experimentally compared against baseline and state-of-the-art recommendation
methods on 21 datasets from various domains. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method produces accurate predictions and
outperforms existing methods. We also show that the proposed approach produces
superior results in low dimensions, proving its effectiveness for data
visualization and exploration.

Sustainability became a broad and complex topic entangled with AI. Many
organizations (government, corporate, not-for-profits, charities and NGOs) have
diversified strategies driving AI for business optimization and
social-and-environmental justice. Partnerships and collaborations become
important more than ever for equity and inclusion of diversified and
