integral-field spectroscopy of the nearby merging, luminous infrared galaxy,
NGC 7469. This galaxy hosts a Seyfert type-1.5 nucleus, a highly ionized
outflow, and a bright, circumnuclear star-forming ring, making it an ideal
target to study AGN feedback in the local Universe. We take advantage of the
high spatial/spectral resolution of JWST/MIRI to isolate the star-forming
regions surrounding the central active nucleus and study the properties of the
dust and warm molecular gas on ~100 pc scales. The starburst ring exhibits
prominent Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, with grain sizes and
ionization states varying by only ~30%, and a total star formation rate of $\rm
10 - 30 \ M_\odot$/yr derived from fine structure and recombination emission
lines. Using pure rotational lines of H2, we detect 1.2$\times$10$^{7} \rm \
M_\odot$ of warm molecular gas at a temperature higher than 200 K in the ring.
All PAH bands get significantly weaker towards the central source, where larger
and possibly more ionized grains dominate the emission. However, the bulk of
the dust and molecular gas in the ring appears unaffected by the ionizing
radiation or the outflowing wind from the AGN. These observations highlight the
power of JWST to probe the inner regions of dusty, rapidly evolving galaxies

co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their hosts.

that if P is a properad under properad Lieb of Lie bialgebras , then the
associated twisted properad tw(P) becomes in general a properad under quasi-Lie

properad tw(Lieb) is highly non-trivial -- it contains the cohomology of the so
called haired graph complex introduced and studied recently in the context of
the theory of long knots and the theory of moduli spaces of algebraic curves.
  Using a polydifferential functor from the category of props to the category
of operads, we introduce the notion of a Maurer-Cartan element of a strongly
homotopy Lie bialgebra, and use it to construct a new twisting endofunctor Tw
in the category dg prop(erad)s P under HoLieb, the minimal resolution of Lieb.
We prove that Tw(Holieb) is quasi-isomorphic to Lieb, and establish its
relation to the homotopy theory of triangular Lie bialgebras. It is proven that
the dg Lie algebra controlling deformations of the map from Lieb to P acts on
Tw(P) by derivations. In some important examples this dg Lie algebra has a rich

Grothendieck-Teichmueller Lie algebra).
  Finally, we introduce a diamond version of the endofunctor Tw which works in
the category of dg properads under involutive (strongly homotopy) Lie
bialgebras, and discuss its applications in string topology.

cell-cell communication, i.e. contact-based or diffusive signalling, which
generates both a spatial and temporal dependence on cell behaviours. Motivated
by cellular mechanisms that control cell-fate decisions in developing bilayer
tissues, we use dynamical systems coupled with multilayer graphs to analyse the
role of signalling polarity and pathway crosstalk in fine-grain pattern

systems in combination with concepts from monotone dynamical systems, we
exploit the extensive dimensionality reduction to provide existence conditions
for the polarity required to induce fine-grain laminar patterns with multiple
spatially dependent intracellular components. We then explore the spectral
links between the quotient and large-scale dynamical systems to extend the
laminar patterning criteria from existence to convergence for sufficiently
large amounts of cellular polarity in the large-scale dynamical system,

aspect: their edge spectra are incredibly rich and confounding. For example,
even in the simple case where the bulk spectrum consists of two bands with
Chern number $\pm 1$, the edge spectrum in the slab geometry may have one or
two edge states on both edges, or only at one of the edges, depending on the
model parameters. This blatant violation of the familiar bulk-edge
correspondence casts doubt on whether the bulk Chern number can still be a
useful topological invariant, and demands a working theory that can predict and
explain the myriad of edge spectra from the bulk Hamiltonian to restore the
bulk-edge correspondence. We outline how such a theory can be set up to yield a
thorough understanding of the edge phase diagram based on the notion of the
generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) and the asymptotic properties of block
Toeplitz matrices. The procedure is illustrated by solving and comparing three
non-Hermitian generalizations of the Qi-Wu-Zhang model, a canonical example of
two-band Chern insulators. We find that, surprisingly, in many cases the phase
boundaries and the number and location of the edge states can be obtained
analytically. Our analysis also reveals a non-Hermitian semimetal phase whose
energy-momentum spectrum forms a continuous membrane with the edge modes
transversing the hole, or genus, of the membrane. Subtleties in defining the
Chern number over GBZ, which in general is not a smooth manifold and may have
singularities, are demonstrated using examples. The approach presented here can
be generalized to more complicated models of non-Hermitian insulators or
semimetals in two or three dimensions.

to accurately capture anisotropies in the ""true"" luminosity distance. We use
numerical relativity simulations of cosmological large-scale structure
formation which are free from common simplifying assumptions in cosmology. We
find the general, third-order cosmography is accurate to within 1% for
redshifts to z\approx 0.034 when sampling scales strictly above 100 Mpc/h,
which is in agreement with an earlier prediction. We find the inclusion of
small-scale structure generally spoils the ability of the third-order
cosmography to accurately reproduce the full luminosity distance for wide
redshift intervals, as might be expected. For a simulation sampling small-scale
structures, we find a +/- 5% variance in the monopole of the ray-traced
luminosity distance at z \approx 0.02. Further, all 25 observers we study here
see a 9--20% variance in the luminosity distance across their sky at z \approx
0.03, which reduces to 2--5% by z \approx 0.1. These calculations are based on
simulations and ray tracing which adopt fully nonlinear general relativity, and

due to the presence of the existing satellite (SAT) services in these bands, it
is crucial to evaluate the impact of the interference of terrestrial U6G
stations to SAT systems. A comprehensive study on the aggregated U6G-to-SAT
interference is still missing in the literature. In this paper, we propose a
stochastic model of interference (SMI) to evaluate the U6G-to-SAT interference,
including the statistical characterization of array gain and clutter loss and
considering different interference modes. Furthermore, we propose an
approximate geometrical-based stochastic model of interference (GSMI) as an
alternative method to SMI when the clutter-loss distribution is unavailable.
Our results indicate that given the typical international mobile

at both wavelengths with GALARIO. Although the Real visibilities show
structures similar to what has been identified as gaps and rings in
protoplanetary disks, we find that a modified Flat-Topped Gaussian at high
inclination provides the best fit to the observations. This fit agrees well
with expectations for an optically thick, highly inclined disk. Nevertheless,
we find that the geometric models consistently yield positive residuals at the
four corners of the disk at both wavelengths. We interpret these residuals as
evidence that the disk is flared in the millimeter dust. We use a simple toy
model for an edge-on flared disk and find that the residuals best match a disk
with flaring that is mainly restricted to the outer disk at $R \gtrsim 30$ au.

activation in the brain. Since task fMRI residuals often exhibit temporal
autocorrelation, it is common practice to perform prewhitening prior to OLS to
satisfy the assumption of residual independence, equivalent to GLS. While
theoretically straightforward, a major challenge in prewhitening in fMRI is
accurately estimating the residual autocorrelation at each location of the
brain. Assuming a global autocorrelation model, as in several fMRI software
programs, may under- or over-whiten particular regions and fail to achieve
nominal false positive control across the brain. Faster multiband acquisitions
require more sophisticated models to capture autocorrelation, making
prewhitening more difficult. These issues are becoming more critical now
because of a trend towards subject-level analysis, where prewhitening has a
greater impact than in group-average analyses. In this article, we first
thoroughly examine the sources of residual autocorrelation in multiband task
fMRI. We find that residual autocorrelation varies spatially throughout the
cortex and is affected by the task, the acquisition method, modeling choices,
and individual differences. Second, we evaluate the ability of different
AR-based prewhitening strategies to effectively mitigate autocorrelation and
control false positives. We find that allowing the prewhitening filter to vary
spatially is the most important factor for successful prewhitening, even more
so than increasing AR model order. To overcome the computational challenge
associated with spatially variable prewhitening, we developed a computationally
efficient R implementation based on parallelization and fast C++ backend code.
This implementation is included in the open source R package BayesfMRI.

relative azimuthal motion between dust and gas that results from the gas being
torqued. In this work, we present the first nonlinear simulations of the AdSI.
We show that it can destabilize an accreting, dusty disk even in the absence of
a global radial pressure gradient, which is unlike the classic SI. We find the
AdSI drives turbulence and the formation of vertically-extended dust filaments
that undergo merging. In dust-rich disks, merged AdSI filaments reach maximum
dust-to-gas ratios exceeding 100. Moreover, we find that even in dust-poor
disks the AdSI can increase local dust densities by two orders of magnitude. We
discuss the possible role of the AdSI in planetesimal formation, especially in
regions of an accreting PPD with vanishing radial pressure gradients.

Quantum Information Science (QIS) and HEP are deeply intertwined endeavors that
benefit enormously from a strong engagement together. Quantum computers do not
represent a detour for HEP, rather they are set to become an integral part of
our discovery toolkit. Problems ranging from simulating quantum field theories,
to fully leveraging the most sensitive sensor suites for new particle searches,
and even data analysis will run into limiting bottlenecks if constrained to our
current computing paradigms. Easy access to quantum computers is needed to
build a deeper understanding of these opportunities. In turn, HEP brings
crucial expertise to the national quantum ecosystem in quantum domain
knowledge, superconducting technology, cryogenic and fast microelectronics, and
massive-scale project management. The role of quantum technologies across the
entire economy is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade, so it is
important to establish the role of HEP in the efforts surrounding QIS. Fully
delivering on the promise of quantum technologies in the HEP science program
requires robust support. It is important to both invest in the co-design
opportunities afforded by the broader quantum computing ecosystem and leverage
HEP strengths with the goal of designing quantum computers tailored to HEP
science.

the performance effects that result from applying one method (compared to
another method) in the processing of natural language. Yet NLP research in
practice usually does not achieve this goal: In NLP research articles,
typically only a few models are compared. Each model results from a specific
procedural pipeline (here named processing system) that is composed of a
specific collection of methods that are used in preprocessing, pretraining,
hyperparameter tuning, and training on the target task. To make generalizing
inferences about the performance effect that is caused by applying some method
A vs. another method B, it is not sufficient to compare a few specific models
that are produced by a few specific (probably incomparable) processing systems.
Rather, the following procedure would allow drawing inferences about methods'
performance effects: (1) A population of processing systems that researchers
seek to infer to has to be defined. (2) A random sample of processing systems
from this population is drawn. (The drawn processing systems in the sample will
vary with regard to the methods they apply along their procedural pipelines and
also will vary regarding the compositions of their training and test data sets
used for training and evaluation.) (3) Each processing system is applied once
with method A and once with method B. (4) Based on the sample of applied
processing systems, the expected generalization errors of method A and method B
are approximated. (5) The difference between the expected generalization errors
of method A and method B is the estimated average treatment effect due to
applying method A compared to method B in the population of processing systems.

fused filament fabrication 3D printers because it can reach higher speeds than
traditional serial-axis designs. Like serial 3D printers, delta printers suffer
from undesirable vibration at high speeds which degrades the quality of
fabricated parts. This undesirable vibration has been suppressed in serial
printers using linear model-inversion feedforward control methods like the
filtered B-splines (FBS) approach. However, techniques like the FBS approach
are computationally challenging to implement on delta 3D printers because of
their coupled, position-dependent dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
methodology to address the computational bottlenecks by (1) parameterizing the
position-dependent portions of the dynamics offline to enable efficient online
model generation, (2) computing real-time models at sampled points (instead of
every point) along the given trajectory, and (3) employing QR factorization to
reduce the number of floating-point arithmetic operations associated with
matrix inversion. In simulations, we report a computation time reduction of up
to 23x using the proposed method, while maintaining high accuracy, when
compared to a controller using the computationally expensive exact LPV model.
In experiments, we demonstrate significant quality improvements on parts
printed at various positions on the delta 3D printer using our proposed
controller compared to a baseline alternative, which uses an LTI model from one
position. Through acceleration measurements during printing, we also show that
the print quality boost of the proposed controller is due to vibration
reductions of more than 20\% when compared to the baseline controller.

certain mass range at primordial times can act as an alternate production
mechanism for the dark matter particles as it evaporates via Hawking radiation.
Furthermore, the presence of primordial black holes with substantial energy
density gives rise to non-standard cosmology which also modifies the freeze-in
production. In this paper, we have investigated the extended Littlest Seesaw
model under the freeze-in scenario in the presence of a primordial black hole
for various interesting cases and constrained the parameter space accordingly.
If the universe is primordial black hole dominated at any point in the
evolution of the universe, we find that the final relic in that case is

by the freeze-in component for a low dark matter mass.

PaLI generates text based on visual and textual inputs, and with this interface
performs many vision, language, and multimodal tasks, in many languages. To
train PaLI, we make use of large pre-trained encoder-decoder language models
and Vision Transformers (ViTs). This allows us to capitalize on their existing
capabilities and leverage the substantial cost of training them. We find that
joint scaling of the vision and language components is important. Since
existing Transformers for language are much larger than their vision
counterparts, we train a large, 4-billion parameter ViT (ViT-e) to quantify the
benefits from even larger-capacity vision models. To train PaLI, we create a
large multilingual mix of pretraining tasks, based on a new image-text training
set containing 10B images and texts in over 100 languages. PaLI achieves
state-of-the-art in multiple vision and language tasks (such as captioning,
visual question-answering, scene-text understanding), while retaining a simple,

Sometimes, producers and users of databases need to connect several of them for

on matching these spatial databases and more particularly network databases,
such as road networks. With regard to network data, one situation remains
neglected, that of matching a linear database (with polylines objects) with a
surface database (with polygons objects). In any case, users also need to
connect these two types of spatial database. In this paper, a case study is
made using French examples (Cachan, near Paris), as well as international case
studies (Bordeaux in France, Victoria in Canada, and Copenhagen in Denmark), to
propose an approach intended to make coherent network geographical objects in
two different reference frames (linear and surface). This issue is addressed
here through the example of road data. The surface data are then formalized in
order to adapt them to linear data describing the same geographical objects. In
the end, a polygon in the surface data corresponds to a single polyline in the
linear data. This consistency should simplify the transfer of information from
one reference frame (linear or surface) to the other. In other words, the
methodology developed aims to make linear and surfacegeographic data

limit, from which we perform a thorough analysis of the impact of degree
fluctuations on the spectral density, the inverse participation ratio, and the
distribution of the local density of states. We show that all eigenvectors are
extended and that the spectral density exhibits a logarithmic or a power-law
divergence when the variance of the degree distribution is large enough. We
elucidate this singular behaviour by showing that the distribution of the local
density of states at the center of the spectrum displays a power-law tail
determined by the variance of the degree distribution. In the regime of weak
degree fluctuations the spectral density has a finite support, which promotes
the stability of large complex systems on random graphs.

  The planetary system does not appear in any of low-order two or three-planet

challenges the planets formation processes. We also test the dynamical
plausibility of a sixth planet in the system, following hints observed in the

exist over a broad range of masses, and with an orbital period roughly
comprised between 12 and 20 days.

they require a number of gates per circuit that grows exponentially with the

and are hard to extend to clothing because they have a fixed mesh topology and
resolution. To address these limitations, recent work uses implicit surfaces or
point clouds to model clothed bodies. While not limited by topology, such
methods still struggle to model clothing that deviates significantly from the
body, such as skirts and dresses. This is because they rely on the body to
canonicalize the clothed surface by reposing it to a reference shape.
Unfortunately, this process is poorly defined when clothing is far from the
body. Additionally, they use linear blend skinning to pose the body and the
skinning weights are tied to the underlying body parts. In contrast, we model
the clothing deformation in a local coordinate space without canonicalization.
We also relax the skinning weights to let multiple body parts influence the
surface. Specifically, we extend point-based methods with a coarse stage, that
replaces canonicalization with a learned pose-independent ""coarse shape"" that
can capture the rough surface geometry of clothing like skirts. We then refine
this using a network that infers the linear blend skinning weights and pose
dependent displacements from the coarse representation. The approach works well
for garments that both conform to, and deviate from, the body. We demonstrate
the usefulness of our approach by learning person-specific avatars from
examples and then show how they can be animated in new poses and motions. We
also show that the method can learn directly from raw scans with missing data,
greatly simplifying the process of creating realistic avatars. Code is

isolated bands is small compared to the scale of the interactions, the problem
is inherently non-perturbative and requires going beyond the traditional
mean-field theory of superconductivity. In two spatial dimensions, $T_c$ is
controlled by the superconducting phase stiffness. Here we present a general
theoretical framework for computing the electromagnetic response for generic
model Hamiltonians, which controls the maximum possible superconducting phase
stiffness and thereby $T_c$, without resorting to any mean-field approximation.
Importantly, our explicit computations demonstrate that the contribution to the
phase stiffness arises from (i) ``integrating out'' the remote bands that
couple to the microscopic current operator, and (ii) the density-density
interactions projected onto the isolated narrow bands. Our framework can be
used to obtain an upper bound on the phase stiffness, and relatedly the
superconducting transition temperature, for a range of physically inspired
models involving both topological and non-topological narrow bands with
arbitrary density-density interactions. We discuss a number of salient aspects

nature, we investigate whether these sources could be lensed by a hitherto
undetected, faint foreground galaxy. We find that at the current limiting
magnitude with which HD1 and HD2 were imaged, there is only a $7.39\%$
probability they are strongly lensed by spherical deflectors and that the
hypothetical lensing galaxy was too faint to be detected. Meanwhile, with the
limiting magnitudes of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space

$0.058\%$ and $0.0012\%$, respectively. We further find it unlikely that the
luminosities of both sources can be accounted for by lensing that produces a
single, resolved image with sufficiently high magnification. Alternatively, in
the unlikely event that their brightness results from lensing by an elliptical
isothermal galaxy, there is a $30.9 \%$ probability that the lensing galaxy is
too faint to be observable at the current limiting magnitude. Future HST (JWST)
imaging will drop this probability to $0.245 \%$ ($0.0025 \%$). In summary,
while deep imaging with HST and JWST is required to discard the lensing

significant light contributions from another star. Joint modeling of radial
velocities and astrometry constrains the companion mass to $M_2 = 9.62\pm

of $M_2>5\,M_{\odot}$; if the companion were a $5\,M_{\odot}$ star, it would be
$500$ times more luminous than the entire system. These constraints are
insensitive to the mass of the luminous star, which appears as a
slowly-rotating G dwarf ($T_{\rm eff}=5850\,\rm K$, $\log g = 4.5$,
$M=0.93\,M_{\odot}$), with near-solar metallicity ($\rm [Fe/H] = -0.2$) and an
unremarkable abundance pattern. We find no plausible astrophysical scenario

metallicity, and thin-disk Galactic orbit suggest that it was born in the Milky

Common envelope evolution can only produce the system's wide orbit under
extreme and likely unphysical assumptions. Formation models involving triples
or dynamical assembly in an open cluster may be more promising. This is the
nearest known black hole by a factor of 3, and its discovery suggests the
existence of a sizable population of dormant black holes in binaries. Future
Gaia releases will likely facilitate the discovery of dozens more.

limitations of simulation resolution in the stripping of subhaloes by the MW
system, therefore we make predictions for satellite properties in these three
models using $N$-body simulations combined with a semi-analytic halo stripping
algorithm. We find that most CDM and WDM subhaloes of mass $>10^{8}$$M_{\odot}$
are large enough after stripping to fit most satellites; however, the required
amount of stripping often requires a stronger tidal field than is available on
the subhalo's orbit. The lower concentrations of WDM subhaloes enable this
model to explain the required satellite masses with less stripping than is
necessary for CDM, and is thus consistent with orbits of larger pericentres.
SIDM cores offer the best fits to massive, low density satellites at the
expense of predicting many $>10^{9}$$M_{\odot}$ subhaloes to host low density
satellites with no observed analogue. We conclude that an SIDM model must have
a very high velocity-dependent cross-section in order to match all satellites,
and that WDM offers a marginally better fit than CDM to the MW satellite mass
function.

a gravitational system, in a Schr\""odinger-like picture, working about a
general background. This connects gauge symmetry, the constraints,
gravitational dressing, and evolution. Starting with a general time slicing, we
give a simple derivation of the relation between the constraints, the
hamiltonian, and its well-known boundary term. Among different approaches to
quantization with constraints, we focus on a ""gauge-invariant canonical
quantization,"" which is developed perturbatively in the gravitational coupling.
The leading-order solution of the constraints (including the ""Wheeler-DeWitt
equation"") for perturbations about the background is given in terms of an
explicit construction of gravitational dressings built using certain
generalized Green functions; different such dressings corresponding to adding
propagating gravitational waves to a particular solution of the constraints.
Dressed operators commute with the constraints, expressing their gauge
invariance, and have an algebraic structure differing significantly from the
undressed operators of the underlying field theory. These operators can act on
the vacuum to create dressed states, and evolution of general such states is
then generated by the boundary hamiltonian, and alternately may be described in
terms of other relational observables. This provides a concrete approach to
studying perturbative time evolution, including the leading gravitational
backreaction, of quantum states of black holes with flat or anti de Sitter
asymptotics, for example on horizon-crossing slices. This description of
evolution in turn provides a starting point for investigating important
corrections to quantum evolution, that go beyond quantized general relativity.

pulsars have been used to identify a gap between the most massive neutron stars
(NS) and the least massive black holes (BH). BH mass measurements in LMXBs are
typically only possible for transient systems: outburst periods enable
detection via all-sky X-ray monitors, while quiescent periods enable
radial-velocity measurements of the low-mass donor. We present the first
quantitative study of selection biases due to the requirement of transient
behavior for BH mass measurements. Using rapid population synthesis simulations
(COSMIC), detailed binary stellar-evolution models (MESA), and the disk
instability model of transient behavior, we demonstrate that transient LMXB
selection effects do introduce biases into the observed sample. If a gap is not
inherent in BH birth masses, mass growth through LMXB accretion and selection
effects can suppress mass-gap BHs in the observed sample. Our results are
robust against variations of binary evolution prescriptions. We further find
that a population of transient LMXBs with mass-gap BHs form through accretion
induced collapse of a NS during the LMXB phase. The significance of this
population is dependent on the maximum NS birth mass $M_\mathrm{NS,
birth-max}$. For $M_\mathrm{NS, birth-max}=3M_{\odot}$, MESA and COSMIC models
predict a similar fraction of mass gap LMXBs. However, for $M_\mathrm{NS,
birth-max}\lesssim2M_{\odot}$ and realistic models of the disk-instability, our
MESA models produce a dearth of mass-gap LMXBs, more consistent with
observations. This constraint on $M_\mathrm{NS, birth-max}$ is independent of
whether low-mass BHs form at core-collapse.

(DM) halos and power-law spherical systems. The modes were identified in N-body
simulations using multivariate singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) and
corroborated using linear-response theory. The new mode peaks inside the
half-mass radius but has a pattern speed typical of an outer-halo orbit. As it
grows, the radial angle of the eccentric orbits that make up the mode correlate
and lose angular momentum by a resonant couple to outer-halo orbits. This leads
to an unsteady pattern with a density enhancement that swings from one side of
the halo to another along a diameter, like the orbits that comprise the
instability. In this way, the dipole mode is similar to the ROI. Since the DF
found in Nature is unlikely to be smooth and isotropic with $df(E)/dE<0$
necessary for Antonov stability, these modes may be ubiquitous albeit slowly
growing. Halos that are less extended than NFW, such as the Hernquist model,
tend to be stable to this dipole instability. We present the critical stability

performance of learning-based models becomes challenging. This paper presents a
framework to incrementally retrain a model by selecting a subset of test inputs

Algorithms within this framework are evaluated based on (1) model performance
throughout mission lifetime and (2) cumulative costs associated with labeling
and model retraining. We provide an open-source benchmark of a satellite pose
estimation model trained on images of a satellite in space and deployed in
novel scenarios (e.g., different backgrounds or misbehaving pixels), where
algorithms are evaluated on their ability to maintain high performance by
retraining on a subset of inputs. We also propose a novel algorithm to select a
diverse subset of inputs for labeling, by characterizing the information gain
from an input using Bayesian uncertainty quantification and choosing a subset
that maximizes collective information gain using concepts from batch active
learning. We show that our algorithm outperforms others on the benchmark, e.g.,
achieves comparable performance to an algorithm that labels 100% of inputs,
while only labeling 50% of inputs, resulting in low costs and high performance
over the mission lifetime.

plane consists of a network of neurons connected by adaptive transmission
links. This fits with standard computational neuroscience approaches. Each
individual neuron also has a vertical dimension with internal parameters
steering the external membrane-expressed parameters. These determine neural
transmission. The vertical system consists of (a) external parameters at the
membrane layer, divided into compartments (spines, boutons) (b) internal
parameters in the sub-membrane zone and the cytoplasm with its protein
signaling network and (c) core parameters in the nucleus for genetic and
epigenetic information. In such models, each node (=neuron) in the horizontal
network has its own internal memory. Neural transmission and information
storage are systematically separated. This is an important conceptual advance
over synaptic weight models. We discuss the membrane-based (external) filtering
and selection of outside signals for processing. Not every transmission event
leaves a trace. We also illustrate the neuron-internal computing strategies
from intracellular protein signaling to the nucleus as the core system. We want
to show that the individual neuron has an important role in the computation of

variation the Berry connection with respect to an applied electric field, here
we investigate the existence of such Hall effect in the surface states of

the magnitude of the response increases significantly with increasing the tilt

landmarks. In this case, the main goal of the controller is to make progress

global controllers for environments with a polyhedral decomposition; our
solution uses a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program with Chance
Constraints to take into account the uncertainty in landmark measurements.
Building upon this work, we introduce the concept of virtual landmarks, which
are defined as linear combinations of actual landmark measurements that
minimize the uncertainty in the resulting control actions. Interestingly, our
results show that the first minimum-variance landmark is independent of the
feedback control matrix, thus decoupling the design of the landmark from the
one of the controller; attempting to derive additional, statistically
independent landmarks, however, requires solving non-convex problems that
involve also the controller. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, by
minimizing the variance of the inputs, the resulting controller will be less
conservative, and the robot is able to complete navigation tasks more
effectively (faster and with less jitter in the trajectory).

We also provide estimates of the silicon and aluminum abundances, and upper

Gaussian process fits to the MESA grid in order to determiner the most likely

traditional descriptive and diagnostic analyses for making sense of Big Data
(BD) frameworks' performance. In practice, when processing large (RDF) graphs
on top of relational BD systems, several design decisions emerge and cannot be
decided automatically, e.g., the choice of the schema, the partitioning
technique, and the storage formats. PPA, and in particular ranking functions,
helps enable actionable insights on performance data, leading practitioners to
an easier choice of the best way to deploy BD frameworks, especially for graph
processing. However, the amount of experimental work required to implement PPA
is still huge. In this paper, we present PAPyA 1, a library for implementing
PPA that allows (1) preparing RDF graphs data for a processing pipeline over
relational BD systems, (2) enables automatic ranking of the performance in a
user-defined solution space of experimental dimensions; (3) allows user-defined
flexible extensions in terms of systems to test and ranking methods. We
showcase PAPyA on a set of experiments based on the SparkSQL framework. PAPyA
simplifies the performance analytics of BD systems for processing large (RDF)
graphs.We provide PAPyA as a public open-source library under an MIT license
that will be a catalyst for designing new research prescriptive analytical
techniques for BD applications.

individual Xenon atoms at 4 Kelvin temperature. The arrangement took
approximately 22 hours. This was an outstanding demonstration of control over
individual atoms. Since then, 3D printers developed into a near-ubiquitous
technology. Nevertheless, with typical resolutions in the micrometres, they are
far from the atomic scale of control that the IBM demonstration seemed to
herald. Even the highest resolution achieved with ultrafast lasers driving
two-photon polymerization barely reaches 100 nm, three orders of magnitude
distant from the atomic scale. Here, we adopt a long-term view when we ask
about the possibility of a 3D atom printer, which can build an arbitrarily
shaped object of macroscopic dimensions with control over its atomic structure
at room temperature. After discussing the state-of-the-art technology based on
direct laser writing, we identify three fundamental challenges. The first is
the fat fingers problem, i.e., laser wavelengths are much larger than the size
of the atoms. The second one is complexity explosion; namely, the number of
processing steps scales with the inverse cube of the resolution, leading to
prohibitively long processing times. The third challenge is the increasing
strength of random fluctuations as we approach the atomic scale. This requires
control over the fluctuations, which we call mischief of fluctuations. Although
direct-writing techniques offer sufficient resolution, speed, and excellent
flexibility for the mesoscopic scale, each of the three fundamental problems
appears enough to render the atomic scale unreachable. In contrast, these three
challenges are not fundamental limitations to self-organisation. We propose a
potential path to a 3D atom printer, where laser-driven self-organisation can
complement direct-writing techniques by bridging the atomic and mesoscopic
scales.

spectroscopic signature of gravitational darkening. We find good agreement: 70%
of the sample (64 out of 92 stars) is consistent with zero difference between
the two methods using $1\sigma$ errors, and there is a strong linear
correlation coefficient between the two methods of $r=+0.63\pm0.05$. There is
some evidence that the H$\alpha$ profile fitting method overestimates the
inclination angle for $i\lesssim 25^\circ$, perhaps due to the neglect of
incoherent electron scattering on the H$\alpha$ line widths, while the
gravitational darkening method underestimates the inclination angle for
$i\gtrsim70^\circ$, perhaps due to the neglect of disk radiative transfer
effects on the optical spectrum. Overall, it is demonstrated that a single
H$\alpha$ spectrum of modest resolution and SNR can be used to extract a useful
estimate for the inclination angle of an individual Be star. This allows
equatorial rotation velocities for individual Be stars to be derived from $v
\sin i $ measurements and will allow Be stars to be used to search for
correlated spin axes in young, open clusters if unbiased (with respect to

pairs. This is accompanied by the breaking of certain symmetries of the
eigenvectors and, typically, also a drastic change in the behavior of the
system. In this paper, we classify the eigenspace of pseudo-Hermitian matrices
and show that such symmetry breaking occurs if and only if eigenvalues of
opposite kinds collide on the real axis of the complex eigenvalue plane. This
enables a classification of the disconnected regions in parameter space where
all eigenvalues are real -- which correspond, physically, to the stable phases
of the system. These disconnected regions are surrounded by exceptional
surfaces which comprise all the real-valued exceptional points of
pseudo-Hermitian matrices. The exceptional surfaces, together with the diabolic
points created by their intersections, comprise all points of
pseudo-Hermiticity breaking. In particular, this clarifies that the degeneracy
involved in symmetry breaking is not necessarily an exceptional point. We also
discuss how our study relates to conserved quantities and derive the conditions
for when degeneracies caused by external symmetries are susceptible to
thresholdless pseudo-Hermiticity breaking. We illustrate our results with
examples from photonics, condensed matter physics, and mechanics.

discovering their intrinsic properties. Using the visual modality alone is
insufficient for deriving intuition behind object properties (e.g., which of
two boxes is heavier), making it essential to consider non-visual modalities as
well, such as the tactile and auditory. Whereas robots may leverage various
modalities to obtain object property understanding via learned exploratory
interactions with objects (e.g., grasping, lifting, and shaking behaviors),
challenges remain: the implicit knowledge acquired by one robot via object
exploration cannot be directly leveraged by another robot with different
morphology, because the sensor models, observed data distributions, and
interaction capabilities are different across these different robot
configurations. To avoid the costly process of learning interactive object
perception tasks from scratch, we propose a multi-stage projection framework
for each new robot for transferring implicit knowledge of object properties
across heterogeneous robot morphologies. We evaluate our approach on the
object-property recognition and object-identity recognition tasks, using a
dataset containing two heterogeneous robots that perform 7,600 object
interactions. Results indicate that knowledge can be transferred across robots,
such that a newly-deployed robot can bootstrap its recognition models without
exhaustively exploring all objects. We also propose a data augmentation

and late type galaxies at intermediate redshift. The two catalogues were built
by applying supervised deep learning (convolutional neural networks, CNNs) to
the Dark Energy Survey data down to a magnitude limit of $\sim$21 mag. The
methodologies used for the construction of the catalogues include differences
such as the cutout sizes, the labels used for training, and the input to the
CNN - monochromatic images versus $gri$-band normalized images. In addition,
one catalogue is trained using bright galaxies observed with DES ($i<18$),
while the other is trained with bright galaxies ($r<17.5$) and `emulated'
galaxies up to $r$-band magnitude $22.5$. Despite the different approaches, the
agreement between the two catalogues is excellent up to $i<19$, demonstrating
that CNN predictions are reliable for samples at least one magnitude fainter
than the training sample limit. It also shows that morphological
classifications based on monochromatic images are comparable to those based on
$gri$-band images, at least in the bright regime. At fainter magnitudes,
$i>19$, the overall agreement is good ($\sim$95\%), but is mostly driven by the
large spiral fraction in the two catalogues. In contrast, the agreement within
the elliptical population is not as good, especially at faint magnitudes. By
studying the mismatched cases we are able to identify lenticular galaxies (at
least up to $i<19$), which are difficult to distinguish using standard
classification approaches. The synergy of both catalogues provides an unique
opportunity to select a population of unusual galaxies.

application in 5G and beyond due to its mission-critical nature under limited
communication resources. Current solutions hinge on not only utilizing
ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) links but also predicting
future states, which may consume enormous communication resources and struggle
with a short prediction time horizon. To fill this void, in this article we
propose a novel two-way Koopman autoencoder (AE) approach wherein: 1) a sensing
Koopman AE learns to understand the temporal state dynamics and predicts
missing packets from a sensor to its remote controller; and 2) a controlling
Koopman AE learns to understand the temporal action dynamics and predicts
missing packets from the controller to an actuator co-located with the sensor.
Specifically, each Koopman AE aims to learn the Koopman operator in the hidden
layers while the encoder of the AE aims to project the non-linear dynamics onto
a lifted subspace, which is reverted into the original non-linear dynamics by
the decoder of the AE. The Koopman operator describes the linearized temporal
dynamics, enabling long-term future prediction and coping with missing packets
and closed-form optimal control in the lifted subspace. Simulation results
corroborate that the proposed approach achieves a 38x lower mean squared
control error at 0 dBm signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than the non-predictive
baseline.

parallel-in-time algorithm of multigrid reduction-in-time (MGRIT) for
discretizations of constant-wave-speed linear advection problems. We focus on
common method-of-lines discretizations that employ upwind finite differences in
space and Runge-Kutta methods in time. Using a convergence framework we
developed in previous work, we prove for a subclass of these discretizations
that, if using the standard approach of rediscretizing the fine-grid problem on
the coarse grid, robust MGRIT convergence with respect to CFL number and
coarsening factor is not possible. This poor convergence and non-robustness is
caused, at least in part, by an inadequate coarse-grid correction for smooth
Fourier modes known as characteristic components.We propose an alternative
coarse-grid that provides a better correction of these modes. This coarse-grid
operator is related to previous work and uses a semi-Lagrangian discretization
combined with an implicitly treated truncation error correction. Theory and
numerical experiments show the coarse-grid operator yields fast MGRIT
convergence for many of the method-of-lines discretizations considered,
including for both implicit and explicit discretizations of high order.
Parallel results demonstrate substantial speed-up over sequential

we develop a method which utilizes frequency-domain to measure absolute optical
properties of turbid samples in a standard cuvette (45 mm by 10 mm by 10 mm).
Inspired by the self calibrating method, which removes instrumental confounds,
the method uses measurements of the diffuse complex transmittance at two sets

relative error in the absorption coefficient compared to the reduced scattering
coefficient; accuracy is tied to knowledge of the samples index of refraction.

(rsbGMRES) was proposed. Such methods use the equivalence of the shifted system
to a Sylvester equation and exploit the shift invariance of the block Krylov
subspace generated from the Sylvester operator. This avoids the need for
initial residuals to span the same subspace and allows for a viable restarted
Krylov subspace method with recycling for solving sequences of shifted systems.

associated with developing methods based on projected Krylov subspaces such as
rsbGMRES, while also allowing for practical methods to fit within a well known
residual projection framework. In addition, unprojected methods are known to be
advantageous when the projector is expensive to apply, making them of
significant interest for High-Performance Computing applications. We develop an

networks has recently been shown to provide benefits to large scale
state-of-the-art models. However, network connectivity also plays a significant
role on the learning performance of shallow networks, such as the classic
Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). Efficiently finding sparse connectivity
patterns that improve the learning performance of shallow networks is a
fundamental problem. While recent principled approaches explicitly include
network connections as model parameters that must be optimized, they often rely
on explicit penalization or have network sparsity as a hyperparameter. This
work presents the Network Connectivity Gradients (NCG), a method to find
optimal connectivity patterns for RBMs based on the idea of network gradients:
computing the gradient of every possible connection, given a specific
connection pattern, and using the gradient to drive a continuous connection
strength parameter that in turn is used to determine the connection pattern.
Thus, learning RBM parameters and learning network connections is truly jointly
performed, albeit with different learning rates, and without changes to the
model's classic objective function. The method is applied to the MNIST and
other data sets showing that better RBM models are found for the benchmark
tasks of sample generation and input classification. Results also show that NCG
is robust to network initialization, both adding and removing network
connections while learning.

miscalibration of neural networks and the challenge of obtaining adequate
datasets. In order to address these imitations, we propose to employ ensembles
of deep semantic segmentation networks trained with systematically augmented

conservatism during motion planning, we directly employ the probabilistic
perception via a scenario-based path planning approach. A velocity scheduling
scheme is applied to the path to ensure a safe motion despite tracking

Neptune, most of which have been discovered in compact multi-planet systems.
With its inner ultra-short period planet b aligned with the star and two larger
outer planets d-c on polar orbits, the multi-planet system HD 3167 features a
peculiar architecture and offers the possibility to investigate both dynamical
and atmospheric evolution processes. To this purpose we combined multiple
datasets of transit photometry and radial velocimetry (RV) to revise the
properties of the system and inform models of its planets. This effort was
spearheaded by CHEOPS observations of HD 3167b, which appear inconsistent with
a purely rocky composition despite its extreme irradiation. Overall the
precision on the planetary orbital periods are improved by an order of
magnitude, and the uncertainties on the densities of the transiting planets b
and c are decreased by a factor of 3. Internal structure and atmospheric
simulations draw a contrasting picture between HD 3167d, likely a rocky
super-Earth that lost its atmosphere through photo-evaporation, and HD 3167c, a
mini-Neptune that kept a substantial primordial gaseous envelope. We detect a
fourth, more massive planet on a larger orbit, likely coplanar with HD 3167d-c.
Dynamical simulations indeed show that the outer planetary system d-c-e was
tilted, as a whole, early in the system history, when HD 3167b was still
dominated by the star influence and maintained its aligned orbit. RV data and
direct imaging rule out that the companion that could be responsible for the
present-day architecture is still bound to the HD\,3167 system. Similar global
studies of multi-planet systems will tell how many share the peculiar
properties of the HD3167 system, which remains a target of choice for follow-up
observations and simulations.

optimization counterparts are important for many practical settings. These
problems typically consider full knowledge about the input. In practical
settings, however, uncertainty in the input data is a usual phenomenon, whereby
this is normally not covered in optimization versions of NP problems.
  One concept to model the uncertainty in the input data, is recoverable
robustness. The instance of the recoverable robust version of a combinatorial
problem P is split into a base scenario \sigma_0 and an uncertainty scenario
set \textsf{S}. The base scenario and all members of the uncertainty scenario
set are instances of the original combinatorial problem P. The task is to
calculate a solution \texttt{s}_0 for the base scenario \sigma_0 and solutions
\texttt{s} for all uncertainty scenarios \sigma \in \textsf{S} such that
\texttt{s}_0 and \texttt{s} are not too far away from each other according to a
distance measure, so \texttt{s}_0 can be easily adapted to \texttt{s}. This
paper introduces Hamming Distance Recoverable Robustness, in which solutions
\texttt{s}_0 and \texttt{s} have to be calculated, such that \texttt{s}_0 and
\texttt{s} may only differ in at most $\kappa$ elements.

optimization problems, typically found in NP for different scenario encodings.
The complexity is primarily situated in the lower levels of the polynomial
hierarchy. The main contribution of the paper is a gadget reduction framework

combinatorial problems is \Sigma^P_{3}-complete. This class includes problems
such as VC, SS or HC. Additionally, we expand the results to
\Sigma^P_{2m+1}-completeness of recoverable robust problems for m \in

method learns motions from a small dataset of user demonstrations, and
generalizes the motion to various scenarios and conditions.

the cobot tasks useful for their workflow. Errors between the cobot
end-effector and target positions range from $0$ to $1.48\pm0.35$mm. For all

consistently segmented from sparse volumetric data or morphed from template

FEA, these overclosures result in numerical instability and inaccuracy as part
of contact analysis. Several techniques exist to fix overclosures, but most
suffer from several drawbacks. This work introduces a novel automated algorithm
in an iterative process to remove overclosure and create a desired minimum gap
for 2D and 3D finite element models. The RBF Network algorithm was introduced
by its four major steps to remove the initial overclosure. Additionally, the
algorithm was validated using two test cases against conventional nodal
adjustment. The first case compared the ability of each algorithm to remove
differing levels of overclosure between two deformable muscles and the effects
on mesh quality. The second case used a non-deformable femur and deformable
distal femoral cartilage geometry with initial overclosure to test both
algorithms and observe the effects on the resulting contact FEA. The RBF
Network in the first case study was successfully able to remove all
overclosures. In the second case, the nodal adjustment method failed to create
a usable FEA model, while the RBF Network had no such issue. This work proposed
an algorithm to remove initial overclosures prior to FEA that has improved
performance over conventional nodal adjustment, especially in complicated
situations and those involving 3D elements. The work can be included in
existing FEA modeling workflows to improve FEA results in situations involving
sparse volumetric segmentation and mesh morphing. This algorithm has been
implemented in MATLAB, and the source code is publicly available to download at

computationally challenging. We introduce Spectroscopic r-Process Abundance
Retrieval for Kilonovae (SPARK), a modular framework to perform Bayesian
inference on kilonova spectra with the goals of inferring elemental abundance
patterns and identifying absorption features at early times. SPARK inputs an
atomic line list and abundance patterns from reaction network calculations into
the TARDIS radiative transfer code. It then performs fast Bayesian inference on
observed kilonova spectra by training a Gaussian process surrogate for the
approximate posteriors of kilonova ejecta parameters, via active learning. We
use the spectrum of GW170817 at 1.4 days to perform the first inference on a
kilonova spectrum, and recover a complete abundance pattern. Our inference
shows that this ejecta was generated by an r-process with either (1) high
electron fraction Y_e ~ 0.35 and high entropy s/k_B ~ 25, or, (2) a more
moderate Y_e ~ 0.30 and s/k_B ~ 14. These parameters are consistent with a
shocked, polar dynamical component, and a viscously-driven outflow from a
remnant accretion disk, respectively. We also recover previous identifications
of strontium absorption at ~8000 AA, and tentatively identify yttrium and/or
zirconium at < 4500 AA. Our approach will enable computationally-tractable

sequential frames. The proposed method was tested on the liver US tracking

cross-validation on the 24 given US sequences with ground truths shows that the
mean tracking error for all landmarks is 0.65+/-0.56 mm, and the errors of all
landmarks are within 2 mm. We further tested the proposed model on 69 landmarks
from the testing dataset that has a similar image pattern to the training

performance of visual question answering (VQA) has approached human oracles.
However, finetuning such models on limited data often suffers from overfitting
and poor generalization issues, leading to a lack of model robustness. In this
paper, we aim to improve input robustness from an information bottleneck
perspective when adapting pretrained VLMs to the downstream VQA task. Input
robustness refers to the ability of models to defend against visual and
linguistic input variations, as well as shortcut learning involved in inputs.
Generally, the representations obtained by pretrained VLMs inevitably contain
irrelevant and redundant information for a specific downstream task, resulting
in statistically spurious correlations and insensitivity to input variations.
To encourage representations to converge to a minimal sufficient statistic in
multimodal learning, we propose Correlation Information Bottleneck (CIB), which
seeks a tradeoff between compression and redundancy in representations by
minimizing the mutual information (MI) between inputs and representations while
maximizing the MI between outputs and representations. Moreover, we derive a
tight theoretical upper bound for the mutual information between multimodal
inputs and representations, incorporating different internal correlations that
guide models to learn more robust representations and facilitate modality
alignment. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of the proposed CIB in terms of input robustness and accuracy.

masses by, on average, $\sim 0.2$ dex, in particular for systems with young
stars (D$_n$4000$\,<1.5$), when the two indices are included in the SED
fitting. We then compare the D$_n$4000 and H$_\delta$ of AGN with sources in
the reference catalogue, accounting for the different stellar mass of the two
populations. Low to moderate L$_X$ AGN tend to reside in galaxies with older
stellar populations and are less likely to have experienced a recent star
formation burst, compared to galaxies in the control sample. We, also, compare
the two populations as a function of their morphology (bulge-dominated, BD, vs.
non-BD) and compactness. A similar fraction of AGN and non-AGN systems are
classified as non-BD ($\sim 70\%$). Our analysis shows that BD AGN tend to have
younger stellar populations compared to BD, non-AGN systems. On the other hand,
non-BD AGN have, on average, older stellar populations and are less likely to
have experienced a burst compared to non-BD sources in the reference sample.
Furthermore, AGN tend to prefer more compact systems compared to non-AGN.

expected. A promising solution is to leverage human prowess by interconnecting
robot and human via teleoperation. Towards creating seamless operation, this
paper presents a dynamic telelocomotion framework that synchronizes the gait of
a human pilot with the walking of a bipedal robot. First, we introduce a method
to generate a virtual human walking model from the stepping behavior of a human
pilot which serves as a reference for the robot to walk. Second, the dynamics
of the walking reference and robot walking are synchronized by applying forces
to the human pilot and the robot to achieve dynamic similarity between the two
systems. This enables the human pilot to continuously perceive and cancel any
asynchrony between the walking reference and robot. A consistent step placement
strategy for the robot is derived to maintain dynamic similarity through step
transitions. Using our human-machine-interface, we demonstrate that the human
pilot can achieve stable and synchronous teleoperation of a simulated robot
through stepping-in-place, walking, and disturbance rejection experiments. This
work provides a fundamental step towards transferring human intelligence and

physical phenomena, such as moir\'e excitons and correlated electronic phases.
To gain insight into these new phenomena, it is crucial to unveil the
underlying coupling between atomic layers. Recently, the rhombohedral-stacked

interest because of the emergence of an out-of-plane polarization from
non-ferroelectric monolayer constituents. However, as a key parameter
responsible for the physical properties, the interlayer coupling and its
relationship with ferroelectricity in them remain elusive. Here we probe the
asymmetric interlayer coupling between the conduction band of one layer and the
valence band from the other layer in a 3R-MoS2 bilayer, which can be understood
as a result of a layer-dependent Berry phase winding. By performing optical
spectroscopy in a dual-gated device, we show a type-II band alignment exists at
K points in the 3R-MoS2 bilayer. Furthermore, by unraveling various
contributions to the band offset, we quantitatively determine the asymmetric
interlayer coupling and spontaneous polarization in 3R-MoS2.

sending a robot to the neighboring area in case it detects a failure. In order
to deal with unpredictability and to improve on the efficiency in the
deterministic patrolling scheme, this paper proposes random strategies to cover
the areas distributed among the agents. First, a theoretical study of the
stochastic process is addressed in this paper for two metrics: the \emph{idle
time}, the expected time between two consecutive observations of any point of
the terrain and the \emph{isolation time}, the expected time that a robot is
without communication with any other robot. After that, the random strategies
are experimentally compared with the deterministic strategy adding another
metric: the \emph{broadcast time}, the expected time elapsed from the moment a
robot emits a message until it is received by all the other robots of the team.
The simulations show that theoretical results are in good agreement with the
simulations and the random strategies outperform the behavior obtained with the
deterministic protocol proposed in the literature.

catalog, GWTC-3, a measurement of the astrophysical distribution of the black
hole spin orientations remains elusive. This is usually probed by measuring the
cosine of the tilt angle ($\cos\tau$) between each black hole spin and the
orbital angular momentum, $\cos\tau=+1$ being perfect alignment. Abbott et al.
has modeled the $\cos\tau$ distribution as a mixture of an isotropic component
and a Gaussian component with mean fixed at +1 and width measured from the
data. We want to verify if the data require the existence of such a peak at
$\cos\tau=+1$. We use various alternative models for the astrophysical tilt
distribution and measure their parameters using the LVK GWTC-3 catalog. We find
that a) Augmenting the LVK model such that the mean $\mu$ of the Gaussian is
not fixed at +1 returns results that strongly depend on priors. If we allow
$\mu>+1$ then the resulting astrophysical $\cos\tau$ distribution peaks at +1
and looks linear, rather than Gaussian. If we constrain $-1\leq \mu\leq+1$ the
Gaussian component peaks at $\mu=0.48^{+0.46}_{-0.99}$ (median and 90%
symmetric credible interval). Two other 2-component mixture models yield
$\cos\tau$ distributions that either have a broad peak centered at
$0.19^{+0.22}_{-0.18}$ or a plateau that spans the range [-0.5, +1], without a
clear peak at +1. b) All of the models we considered agree on the fact that
there is no excess of black hole tilts at around -1. c) While yielding quite
different posteriors, the models considered in this work have Bayesian
evidences that are the same within error bars. We conclude that the current
dataset is not sufficiently informative to draw any model-independent
conclusions on the astrophysical distribution of spin tilts, except that there
is no excess of spins with negatively aligned tilts.

The two families are distinguished by one being spatially isotropic while the

which improves a previous stability result established by the second author

towards understanding the behaviour of nonlinear perturbations of the isotropic

health settings utilize several strategies to mitigate bias due to confounding
by indication. There are two broad classes of approaches for these purposes:
use of confounders and instrumental variables (IVs). Because such approaches
are largely characterized by untestable assumptions, analysts must operate
under an indefinite paradigm that these methods will work imperfectly. In this
tutorial, we formalize a set of general principles and heuristics for
estimating causal effects in the two approaches when the assumptions are
potentially violated. This crucially requires reframing the process of
observational studies as hypothesizing potential scenarios where the estimates
from one approach are less inconsistent than the other. While most of our
discussion of methodology centers around the linear setting, we touch upon
complexities in non-linear settings and flexible procedures such as target
minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) and double machine learning (DML). To
demonstrate the application of our principles, we investigate the use of
donepezil off-label for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We compare and
contrast results from confounder and IV methods, traditional and flexible,

cohort equations (PCE) for patients with specific comorbidities and geographic
locations. With over 363 customized risk models in the literature, we aim to
evaluate such revised models to determine if the performance improvements
translate to gains in clinical utility.
  Methods: We re-train a baseline PCE using the ACC/AHA PCE variables and
revise it to incorporate subject-level geographic location and comorbidity
information. We apply fixed effects, random effects, and extreme gradient
boosting models to handle the correlation and heterogeneity induced by
locations. Models are trained using 2,464,522 claims records from Optum
Clinformatics Data Mart and validated in the hold-out set (N=1,056,224). We
evaluate models' performance overall and across subgroups defined by the
presence or absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) and geographic locations. We evaluate models' expected net benefit using
decision curve analysis and models' statistical properties using several
discrimination and calibration metrics.
  Results: The baseline PCE is miscalibrated overall, in patients with CKD or
RA, and locations with small populations. Our revised models improved both the
overall (GND P-value=0.41) and subgroup calibration but only enhanced net
benefit in the underrepresented subgroups. The gains are larger in the
subgroups with comorbidities and heterogeneous across geographic locations.
  Conclusions: Revising the PCE with comorbidity and location information
significantly enhanced models' calibration; however, such improvements do not
necessarily translate to clinical gains. Thus, we recommend future works to
quantify the consequences from using risk calculators to guide clinical
decisions.

idea is to use the model learned on labeled data to generate pseudo-labels for

active attempts typically employ a momentum teacher for pseudo-label prediction
yet observe the confirmation bias issue, where the incorrect predictions may
provide wrong supervision signals and get accumulated in the training process.
The primary cause of such a drawback is that the prevailing self-training
framework acts as guiding the current state with previous knowledge, because
the teacher is updated with the past student only. To alleviate this problem,
we propose a novel self-training strategy, which allows the model to learn from
the future. Concretely, at each training step, we first virtually optimize the
student (i.e., caching the gradients without applying them to the model
weights), then update the teacher with the virtual future student, and finally
ask the teacher to produce pseudo-labels for the current student as the
guidance. In this way, we manage to improve the quality of pseudo-labels and
thus boost the performance. We also develop two variants of our
future-self-training (FST) framework through peeping at the future both deeply

semantic segmentation and semi-supervised semantic segmentation as the

research has been moved from single-modal learning to multi-modal learning, as
real-world data exist in the form of different modalities. However, multi-modal
models often carry more information than single-modal models and they are
usually applied in sensitive scenarios, such as medical report generation or
disease identification. Compared with the existing membership inference against
machine learning classifiers, we focus on the problem that the input and output
of the multi-modal models are in different modalities, such as image
captioning. This work studies the privacy leakage of multi-modal models through
the lens of membership inference attack, a process of determining whether a
data record involves in the model training process or not. To achieve this, we
propose Multi-modal Models Membership Inference (M^4I) with two attack methods
to infer the membership status, named metric-based (MB) M^4I and feature-based
(FB) M^4I, respectively. More specifically, MB M^4I adopts similarity metrics
while attacking to infer target data membership. FB M^4I uses a pre-trained
shadow multi-modal feature extractor to achieve the purpose of data inference
attack by comparing the similarities from extracted input and output features.
Extensive experimental results show that both attack methods can achieve strong
performances. Respectively, 72.5% and 94.83% of attack success rates on average
can be obtained under unrestricted scenarios. Moreover, we evaluate multiple
defense mechanisms against our attacks. The source code of M^4I attacks is

(i.e., frontalization) or disentangle pose information for face recognition. We
instead propose a new approach to utilize pose as an auxiliary information via
an attention mechanism. In this paper, we hypothesize that pose attended
information using an attention mechanism can guide contextual and distinctive
feature extraction from profile faces, which further benefits a better
representation learning in an embedded domain. To achieve this, first, we
design a unified coupled profile-to-frontal face recognition network. It learns
the mapping from faces to a compact embedding subspace via a class-specific
contrastive loss. Second, we develop a novel pose attention block (PAB) to
specially guide the pose-agnostic feature extraction from profile faces. To be
more specific, PAB is designed to explicitly help the network to focus on
important features along both channel and spatial dimension while learning
discriminative yet pose invariant features in an embedding subspace. To
validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on
both controlled and in the wild benchmarks including Multi-PIE, CFP, IJBC, and
show superiority over the state of the arts.

trajectories and actively avoid moving obstacles. Most previous works designed
path planning algorithms based on one single map representation, such as the
geometric, occupancy, or ESDF map. Although they have shown success in static
environments, due to the limitation of map representation, those methods cannot
reliably handle static and dynamic obstacles simultaneously. To address the
problem, this paper proposes a gradient-based B-spline trajectory optimization
algorithm utilizing the robot's onboard vision. The depth vision enables the
robot to track and represent dynamic objects geometrically based on the voxel
map. The proposed optimization first adopts the circle-based guide-point
algorithm to approximate the costs and gradients for avoiding static obstacles.
Then, with the vision-detected moving objects, our receding-horizon distance
field is simultaneously used to prevent dynamic collisions. Finally, the
iterative re-guide strategy is applied to generate the collision-free
trajectory. The simulation and physical experiments prove that our method can
run in real-time to navigate dynamic environments safely.

place on the opinions of other nodes. When $\gamma = 0$, this influence
function exactly recovers Taylor's averaging model; when $\gamma \rightarrow

We show that the {set} of steady states of our {SBCM} is qualitatively similar

eccentric double white dwarf binaries. As the launching of the space-based
gravitational-wave detector, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), is
just around the corner, detection of gravitational wave signals from such
systems is anticipated. In this paper, we discuss the influence of the
dynamical tide on eccentric orbits, focusing on the effect on orbital
precession. We show that in orbits with a high eccentricity, resonance can
cause a large precession when a harmonic of the orbital frequency matches the
natural frequencies of the normal modes of the star. In contrast to the case
with circular orbits, each mode can encounter multiple resonances with
different harmonics and these resonant regions can cover about 10% of the
frequency space for orbits with close separations. In this case, the tidal
precession effect is distinct from the other contributions and can be
identified with LISA if the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough. However,
within the highly eccentric-small separation region, the dynamical tide causes
chaotic motion and the gravitational wave signal becomes unpredictable. Even
not at resonance, the dynamical tide can contribute up to 20% of the precession
for orbits close to Roche-lobe filling separation with low eccentricities and
LISA can resolve these off-resonant dynamical tide effects within the low
eccentricity-small orbital separation region of the parameter space. For lower
mass systems, the dynamical tide effect can degenerate with the uncertainties
of the eccentricity, making it unmeasurable from the precession rate alone. For
higher mass systems, the radiation reaction effect becomes significant enough
to constrain the eccentricity, allowing the measurement of the dynamical tide.

is a $K_t$-minor-free graph $G$ that is not $\lambda$-choosable. We then
construct several types of $K_t$-minor-free graphs that are not
$\lambda$-choosable, where $k_\lambda - (t-1)$ gets larger as
$k_\lambda-|\lambda|$ gets larger. In partcular, for any $q$ and any $\epsilon

$\lambda$ of $\lfloor (2-\epsilon)t \rfloor$ with $|\lambda| =q$, there is a
$K_t$-minor-free graph that is not $\lambda$-choosable. The $q=1$ case of this

  We first present an $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time algorithm for $2$FRP in $n$-vertex

is a generalization of the well-studied Replacement Paths problem (RP) that
asks for the distances between $s$ and $t$ for any single edge failure, $2$FRP
is at least as hard as RP. Since RP in graphs with arbitrary weights is

$\tilde{O}(n^{f+1})$ time algorithm for the $f$FRP problem, giving the first
improvement over the straightforward $O(n^{f+2})$ time algorithm.
  Then we focus on the restriction of $2$FRP to graphs with small integer
weights bounded by $M$ in absolute values. Using fast rectangular matrix
multiplication, we obtain a randomized algorithm that runs in
$\tilde{O}(M^{2/3}n^{2.9153})$ time. This implies an improvement over our
$\tilde{O}(n^{f+1})$ time arbitrary weight algorithm for all $f>1$. We also
present a data structure variant of the algorithm that can trade off
pre-processing and query time. In addition to the algebraic algorithms, we also
give an $n^{8/3-o(1)}$ conditional lower bound for combinatorial $2$FRP
algorithms in directed unweighted graphs.

integration has an influence on wholesale market prices, demand, and supply.
The purpose of this article is to shed light onto the impact of efficient DER
aggregation on the market power of conventional generators. Firstly, under
efficient DER aggregation, we quantify the social welfare gap between two
cases: when conventional generators are truthful, and when they are strategic.
We also do the same when DERs are not present. Secondly, we show that the gap
due to market power of generators in the presence of DERs is smaller than the
one when there is no DER participation. Finally, we provide explicit

compute its new neighbors as a subset of its original neighborhood of radius
$O(\log(1/\lambda))$. The optimal quadratic trade-off is known as the Ramanujan
bound, so our construction gives almost Ramanujan expanders from arbitrary

  The locality of the transformation preserves structural properties of the
original graph, and thus has many consequences. Applied to Cayley graphs, our
transformation shows that any expanding finite group has almost Ramanujan
expanding generators. Similarly, one can obtain almost optimal explicit
constructions of quantum expanders, dimension expanders, monotone expanders,
etc., from existing (suboptimal) constructions of such objects. Another
consequence is a ""derandomized"" random walk on the original (suboptimal)
expander with almost optimal convergence rate. Our transformation also applies

demonstrates the appealing promise to understand the 3D visual world, using a
standard 2D ViT architecture, with only minimal customization at the input and

shift from conventional frame-based cameras, however, event signals in a time

the moving body parts and ignores those static body parts, resulting in some

proposes a novel densely connected recurrent architecture to address the

approximating intractable distributions. However, its usage is limited in the
context of deep latent variable models owing to costly datapoint-wise sampling
iterations and slow convergence. This paper proposes the amortized Langevin
dynamics (ALD), wherein datapoint-wise MCMC iterations are entirely replaced
with updates of an encoder that maps observations into latent variables. This
amortization enables efficient posterior sampling without datapoint-wise
iterations. Despite its efficiency, we prove that ALD is valid as an MCMC
algorithm, whose Markov chain has the target posterior as a stationary
distribution under mild assumptions. Based on the ALD, we also present a new
deep latent variable model named the Langevin autoencoder (LAE). Interestingly,
the LAE can be implemented by slightly modifying the traditional autoencoder.
Using multiple synthetic datasets, we first validate that ALD can properly
obtain samples from target posteriors. We also evaluate the LAE on the image
generation task, and show that our LAE can outperform existing methods based on
variational inference, such as the variational autoencoder, and other
MCMC-based methods in terms of the test likelihood.

dimensionality when deriving policies to optimal control problems. For a given
system representation, i.e. the state variables and control inputs describing a
system, PoDec generates strategies to decompose the joint optimization of
policies for all control inputs. Thereby, policies for different inputs are
derived in a decoupled or cascaded fashion and as functions of some subsets of
the state variables, leading to reduction in computation. However, the choice
of system representation is crucial as it dictates the suboptimality of the
resulting policies. We present a heuristic method to find a representation more
amenable to decomposition. Our approach is based on the observation that every
decomposition enforces a sparsity pattern in the resulting policies at the cost
of optimality and a representation that already leads to a sparse optimal
policy is likely to produce decompositions with lower suboptimalities. As the
optimal policy is not known we construct a system representation that
sparsifies its LQR approximation. For a simplified biped, a 4 degree-of-freedom
manipulator, and a quadcopter, we discover decompositions that offer 10%
reduction in trajectory costs over those identified by vanilla PoDec. Moreover,
the decomposition policies produce trajectories with substantially lower costs
compared to policies obtained from state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
algorithms.

unveil the elemental connection between urban density and diversity. Here we
use an anonymized and privacy-enhanced mobile data set of 0.5 million opted-in
users from three metropolitan areas in the U.S to show that at the scale of
urban streets, density is not the only path to diversity. We represent the
diversity of each street with the Experienced Social Mixing (ESM), which
describes the chances of people meeting diverse income groups throughout their
daily experience. We conduct multiple experiments and show that the
concentration of visitors only explains 26% of street-level ESM. However,
adjacent amenities, residential diversity, and income level account for 44% of

an increased number of food businesses have seen an increased ESM from 2016 to

control systems must be efficient. The cost and size of sensors have limited
the development of self-driving cars. To overcome these restrictions, this
study proposes an efficient framework for the operation of vision-based
automatic vehicles; the framework requires only a monocular camera and a few
inexpensive radars. The proposed algorithm comprises a multi-task UNet (MTUNet)
network for extracting image features and constrained iterative linear
quadratic regulator (CILQR) and vision predictive control (VPC) modules for
rapid motion planning and control. MTUNet is designed to simultaneously solve
lane line segmentation, the ego vehicle's heading angle regression, road type
classification, and traffic object detection tasks at approximately 40 FPS
(frames per second) for 228 x 228 pixel RGB input images. The CILQR controllers
then use the MTUNet outputs and radar data as inputs to produce driving
commands for lateral and longitudinal vehicle guidance within only 1 ms. In
particular, the VPC algorithm is included to reduce steering command latency to
below actuator latency to prevent vehicle understeer during tight turns. The
VPC algorithm uses road curvature data from MTUNet to estimate the correction
of the current steering angle at a look-ahead point to adjust the turning
amount. Including the VPC algorithm in a VPC-CILQR controller leads to higher
performance than CILQR alone; this controller can minimize the influence of
command lag, maintaining the ego car's speed and lateral offset at 76 km/h and
within 0.52 m, respectively, on a simulated road with a curvature of 0.03 1/m.
Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed autonomous driving system, which
does not require high-definition maps, could be applied in current autonomous
vehicles.

half of them are reported to have moons (on the order of $\sim 1$wt.\% of the

has shown that the enigmatic top-shaped figure of asteroids (e.g., Ryugu,
Bennu, and Didymos) could result from an axisymmetric landslide of the primary
during a fast spin-up near the breakup rotation period. Such a landslide would
inevitably form a particulate disk around an asteroid with a short timescale
($\sim 3$ hours). However, the long-term full dynamical evolution is not
investigated. Here, we perform a continuous simulation ($\sim 700$ hours) that
investigates the sequence of events from the surface landslide that forms a
top-shaped asteroid and a particulate disk to disk evolution. We show that the
disk quickly spreads and produces moons (within $\sim 300$ hours). The mass of
the formed moon is consistent with what is observed around the top-shaped
asteroids. We also demonstrate that an equatorial ridge is naturally formed
because a fraction of the disk particles re-accretes selectively onto the
equatorial region of the primary. We envision that Ryugu and Bennu could once
have an ancient moon that was later lost due to a successive moon's orbital
evolution. Alternatively, at the top-shaped asteroid that has a moon, such as
Didymos, no significant orbital evolution of the moon has occurred that would
result in its loss. Our study would also be qualitatively applicable to any
rubble-pile asteroids near the breakup rotation period.

Image-Text Similarity Map (ITSM). Based on it, we surprisingly find that CLIP
prefers the background regions than the foregrounds, and shows erroneous
visualization results against human understanding. This phenomenon is universal
for both vision transformers and convolutional networks, which suggests this
problem is unique and not owing to certain network. Experimentally, we find the
devil is in the pooling part, where inappropriate pooling methods lead to a
phenomenon called semantic shift. For this problem, we propose the Explainable
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (ECLIP), which corrects the
explainability via the Masked Max Pooling. Specifically, to avoid the semantic
shift, we replace the original attention pooling by max pooling to focus on the
confident foreground, with guidance from free attention during training.

words detection in the example of the ""School corpus"" by investigating how to
automatically analyse the detection of stop words in Uzbek texts. This work is
devoted to answering whether there is a good way of evaluating available stop
words for Uzbek texts, or whether it is possible to determine what part of the
Uzbek sentence contains the majority of the stop words by studying the
numerical characteristics of the probability of unique words. The results show
acceptable accuracy of the stop words lists.

lower confidence. Then the uncertainty is undermined and has less effect on

selects points for annotation that likely result in performance improvements to

freeze-out volume ($V$) and the multiplicity parameter ($N_0$) show the
opposite behavior. Larger $T_0$, $n$ and smaller $\beta_T$ as well as $V$ of
the heavier particles indicates the early freeze-out of the heavier particles,
while larger $<p_T>$ for the heavier particles evince that the effect of radial
flow is stronger in heavier particles. The separate set of parameters for each
particle shows the multiple kinetic freeze-out scenario, where the mass
dependent kinetic freeze-out volume shows the volume differential freeze-out
scenario. We also checked the correlation among different parameters, which

$V$, $<p_T>$ and $T_0$, $<p_T>$ and $\beta_T$, $<p_T>$ and $V$, $n$ and $T_0$,

which re-weights the return of trajectories in the replay buffer to boost
sample efficiency. However, training with IS can be unstable and previous
attempts to address this issue mainly focus on analyzing the variance of IS. In
this paper, we reveal that the instability is also related to a new notion of
Reuse Bias of IS -- the bias in off-policy evaluation caused by the reuse of
the replay buffer for evaluation and optimization. We theoretically show that
the off-policy evaluation and optimization of the current policy with the data
from the replay buffer result in an overestimation of the objective, which may
cause an erroneous gradient update and degenerate the performance. We further
provide a high-probability upper bound of the Reuse Bias, and show that
controlling one term of the upper bound can control the Reuse Bias by
introducing the concept of stability for off-policy algorithms. Based on these
analyses, we finally present a novel Bias-Regularized Importance Sampling
(BIRIS) framework along with practical algorithms, which can alleviate the
negative impact of the Reuse Bias. Experimental results show that our
BIRIS-based methods can significantly improve the sample efficiency on a series
of continuous control tasks in MuJoCo.

internet of things, affecting data privacy. Existing frameworks have identified
the need to focus on human-centered design, combining technical and
business/organizational perspectives. However, trust remains a critical issue
that needs to be designed from the beginning. The proposed framework expands
from the human-centered design approach, emphasizing and maintaining the trust
that underpins the process. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for
responsible artificial intelligence (AI) implementation. The proposed framework
emphasizes a synergistic business technology approach for the agile co-creation
process. The aim is to streamline the adoption process of AI to innovate and
improve business by involving all stakeholders throughout the project so that
the AI technology is designed, developed, and deployed in conjunction with
people and not in isolation. The framework presents a fresh viewpoint on
responsible AI implementation based on analytical literature review, conceptual
framework design, and practitioners' mediating expertise. The framework
emphasizes establishing and maintaining trust throughout the human-centered
design and agile development of AI. This human-centered approach is aligned
with and enabled by the privacy by design principle. The creators of the
technology and the end-users are working together to tailor the AI solution

facular and Ca II K observations going back to 1874 and 1892, respectively.
Prior to that time, the only direct data available are for sunspots. We
reassess the relationship between plage areas and sunspot records (areas and

be employed for studies going further back in time, i.e. over the period when
solely sunspot observations are available. We use the plage areas derived from
38 consistently processed Ca II K archives as well as the plage area composite
based on these archives. We find the relationship between plage and sunspot
areas and numbers to be well represented by a power law function. We further
find that the relationships depend on the bandwidth and the solar cycle
strength. The reconstructions with a power law relationship are in good
agreement with the original plage area series, whereas employment of a
cycle-strength-dependent relationship improves the reconstructions only
marginally. Performing the same analysis on other previously published plage
area series, usually derived from a single archive with diverse processing
techniques, returns different results when using different time series. This
highlights the importance of applying a consistent processing to the various

quantile-based risk measures adopted in financial regulations and risk
management. In this paper, we propose a tail risk measure based on the most
probable maximum size of risk events (MPMR) that can occur over a length of
time. MPMR underscores the dependence of the tail risk on the risk management
time frame. Unlike VaR and ES, MPMR does not require specifying a confidence
level. We derive the risk measure analytically for several well-known
distributions. In particular, for the case where the size of the risk event
follows a power law or Pareto distribution, we show that MPMR also scales with
the number of observations $n$ (or equivalently the length of the time
interval) by a power law, $\text{MPMR}(n) \propto n^{\eta}$, where $\eta$ is
the scaling exponent. The scale invariance allows for reasonable estimations of
long-term risks based on the extrapolation of more reliable estimations of
short-term risks. The scaling relationship also gives rise to a robust and
low-bias estimator of the tail index (TI) $\xi$ of the size distribution, $\xi
= 1/\eta$. We demonstrate the use of this risk measure for describing the tail
risks in financial markets as well as the risks associated with natural hazards
(earthquakes, tsunamis, and excessive rainfall).

To consider these criteria, in this article, we propose a non-linear
model-predictive trajectory generator scheme, which couples the longitudinal

progressing towards the goal state. The proposed method takes into account the
infrastructure, surrounding objects, and predictions of the objects' state
through artificial potential-based risk fields included in the cost function of
the model-predictive control (MPC) problem. This trajectory generator enables
anticipatory maneuvers, i.e., mitigating risk far before any safety-critical

representing both highways- and urban situations. The results show the safe and
efficient implementation of the MPC trajectory generator while proving its
real-time applicability.

for the input image and text, where a considerably larger masking ratio is used
for images. Second, we use visual and textual features from different layers to
perform the reconstruction to deal with different levels of abstraction in
visual and language. Third, we develop different designs for vision and
language decoders (i.e., a Transformer for vision and a multi-layer perceptron
for language). To perform a comprehensive evaluation and facilitate further
research, we construct a medical vision-and-language benchmark including three
tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,

enables us to estimate and analyse the frontdoor causal effect or average
causal effect (ACE) as a function of $\rho$. We call this the $\rho_{curve}$.
The $\rho_{curve}$ enables us to specify the confounding strength required to
nullify the ACE. We call this the $\rho_{value}$. Further, the $\rho_{curve}$
also enables us to provide bounds for the ACE given an interval of $\rho$
values. We illustrate the benefits of $\rho$-GNF with experiments on simulated
and real-world data in terms of our empirical ACE bounds being narrower than
other popular ACE bounds.

experiments, three-dimensional characterization of ultrafast OAM-carrying light
beams in spatio-temporal domain has, however, proved difficult to achieve.
Conventional measurement schemes rely on the use of a reference pulsed light
beam which needs to be well-characterized in its phase front and to have
sufficient overlap and coherence with the beam under test, largely limiting
practical applications of these schemes. Here we demonstrate a self-referencing
set-up based on a tilted interferometer that can be used to measure complete
spatio-temporal information of OAM-carrying femtosecond pulses with different
topological charges. Through scanning one interferometer arm, the spectral
phase over the pulse spatial profile can be obtained using the tilted
interference signal, and the temporal envelope of the light field at one
particular position around its phase singularity can be retrieved
simultaneously, enabling three-dimensional beam reconstruction. This
self-referencing technique, capable of measuring spatio-temporal ultrafast
optical-vortex beams, may find many applications in fields of nonlinear optics

associated with sensor installation and measurement accuracy. To overcome the
disadvantages of conventional displacement measurement, computer vision
(CV)-based methods have been implemented due to their remote sensing
capabilities and accuracy. This paper presents a strategy for non-target
structural displacement measurement that makes use of CV to avoid the need to
install a target on the structure while calibrating the displacement using
structured light. The proposed system called as LAVOLUTION calculates the
relative position of the camera with regard to the structure using four equally
spaced beams of structured light and obtains a scale factor to convert pixel
movement into structural displacement. A jig for the four beams of structured
light is designed and a corresponding alignment process is proposed. A method
for calculating the scale factor using the designed jig for tunable
structured-light is proposed and validated via numerical simulations and
lab-scale experiments. To confirm the feasibility of the proposed displacement
measurement process, experiments on a shaking table and a full-scale bridge are
conducted and the accuracy of the proposed method is compared with that of a

Motivated by overparameterized learning settings, in which models are trained

decentralized learning with gradient descent on separable data. Specifically,
for decentralized gradient descent (DGD) and a variety of loss functions that
asymptote to zero at infinity (including exponential and logistic losses), we
derive novel finite-time generalization bounds. This complements a long line of
recent work that studies the generalization performance and the implicit bias
of gradient descent over separable data, but has thus far been limited to
centralized learning scenarios. Notably, our generalization bounds
approximately match in order their centralized counterparts. Critical behind
this, and of independent interest, is establishing novel bounds on the training
loss and the rate-of-consensus of DGD for a class of self-bounded losses.
Finally, on the algorithmic front, we design improved gradient-based routines
for decentralized learning with separable data and empirically demonstrate
orders-of-magnitude of speed-up in terms of both training and generalization
performance.

attention owing to its applicability to extracting generic vision-and-language
representations from medical images and texts. Most existing methods mainly
contain three elements: uni-modal encoders (i.e., a vision encoder and a
language encoder), a multi-modal fusion module, and pretext tasks, with few
studies considering the importance of medical domain expert knowledge and
explicitly exploiting such knowledge to facilitate Med-VLP. Although there
exist knowledge-enhanced vision-and-language pre-training (VLP) methods in the
general domain, most require off-the-shelf toolkits (e.g., object detectors and
scene graph parsers), which are unavailable in the medical domain. In this
paper, we propose a systematic and effective approach to enhance Med-VLP by
structured medical knowledge from three perspectives. First, considering
knowledge can be regarded as the intermediate medium between vision and
language, we align the representations of the vision encoder and the language
encoder through knowledge. Second, we inject knowledge into the multi-modal
fusion model to enable the model to perform reasoning using knowledge as the
supplementation of the input image and text. Third, we guide the model to put
emphasis on the most critical information in images and texts by designing
knowledge-induced pretext tasks. To perform a comprehensive evaluation and
facilitate further research, we construct a medical vision-and-language
benchmark including three tasks. Experimental results illustrate the
effectiveness of our approach, where state-of-the-art performance is achieved
on all downstream tasks. Further analyses explore the effects of different

one-dimensional stub and two-dimensional kagome lattices that have a random
scalar potential and a uniform imaginary vector potential and calculate the
spectra of the complex energy, the participation ratio, and the winding number
as a function of the strength of the imaginary vector potential, $h$. The
flat-band states are found to show a double transition from localized to
delocalized and back to localized states with $h$, in contrast to the
dispersive-band states going through a single delocalization transition. When
$h$ is sufficiently small, all flat-band states are localized. As $h$ increases
above a certain critical value $h_1$, some pair of flat-band states become
delocalized. The participation ratio associated with them increases
substantially and their winding numbers become nonzero. As $h$ increases
further, more and more flat-band states get delocalized until the fraction of
the delocalized states reaches a maximum. For larger $h$ values, a re-entrant
localization takes place and, at another critical value $h_2$, all flat-band
states return to compact localized states with very small participation ratios
and zero winding numbers. This re-entrant localization transition, which is due
to the interplay among disorder, non-Hermiticity, and flat band, is a
phenomenon occurring in many models having an imaginary vector potential and a
flat band simultaneously. We explore the spatial characteristics of the
flat-band states by calculating the local density distribution.

learning, we develop a scalable memory unit by gradually and selectively

field in four dimensions at future null infinity. We start by reviewing the
asymptotic symmetries of electrodynamics in four-dimensional Minkowski
spacetime at future null infinity. We continue by investigating the asymptotic
symmetries of the Kalb-Ramond field at future null infinity. We motivate the
fall-off conditions by demanding the finiteness of energy, momentum, angular
momentum and charge flux through future null infinity. We expand the gauge
fields in ``radial"" and Lorenz gauge and compute the generating charges. Using
the duality between the Kalb-Ramond theory and the scalar field in two
dimensions, we again derive the fields' fall-off conditions and compare them to
the ones obtained above. Our findings can be summarized as follows: The
different gauges yield two similar generating charges, however, the charge
obtained in the ``radial"" gauge vanishes at infinity. This result might
indicate that the fall-off conditions are too strict in this gauge. We observe
consistency in the asymptotic behaviours of Kalb-Ramond and scalar field
theories. Even after we expanded both fields asymptotically, the fall-off
conditions for the Kalb-Ramond field obtained by duality considerations are
compatible with those derived from the finiteness conditions above. This might
also allow us to address the question asked in \cite{Campiglia2018} about which
are the missing asymptotic symmetries generated by the soft charges of scalar
fields.

nominally-resolved flow structures similar to those presented in the
high-resolution solution. Although there are various underlying physical
reasons for this, from the dynamical system point of view all these reasons
manifest themselves as a low-resolution trajectory avoiding the phase space
occupied by the reference solution (the high-resolution solution projected onto
the coarse grid). In order to solve this problem, a set of
hyper-parameterization methods has recently been proposed and successfully
tested on idealized ocean models. In this work, for the first time we apply one
of hyper-parameterization methods (Advection of the image point) to a
comprehensive, rather than idealized, general circulation model of the North
Atlantic.
  The results show that the hyper-parameterization method significantly
improves a non-eddy-resolving solution towards the reference eddy-resolving
solution by reproducing both the large- and small-scale features of the Gulf
Stream flow. The proposed method is much faster than even a single run of the
coarse-grid ocean model, requires no modification of the model, and is easy to
implement. Moreover, the method can take not only the reference solution as
input data but also real measurements from different sources (drifters, weather
stations, etc.), or combination of both. All this offers a great flexibility to
ocean modellers working with mathematical models and/or measurements.

tasks of generating future frames and learning environment dynamics. Recently,
autoregressive latent video models have proved to be a powerful video

pre-training an image generator model, followed by learning an autoregressive
prediction model in the latent space of the image generator. However,
successfully generating high-fidelity and high-resolution videos has yet to be
seen. In this work, we investigate how to train an autoregressive latent video
prediction model capable of predicting high-fidelity future frames with minimal
modification to existing models, and produce high-resolution (256x256) videos.
Specifically, we scale up prior models by employing a high-fidelity image

techniques of top-k sampling and data augmentation to further improve video
prediction quality. Despite the simplicity, the proposed method achieves
competitive performance to state-of-the-art approaches on standard video

music generation, and a popular research direction is to study how to
effectively control the generation process. A straightforward way is to control
a model using different conditions during inference. However, in music
practice, conditions are usually sequential (rather than simple categorical
labels), involving rich information that overlaps with the learned
representation. Consequently, the decoder gets confused about whether to
""listen to"" the latent representation or the condition, and sometimes just
ignores the condition. To solve this problem, we leverage domain adversarial
training to disentangle the representation from condition cues for better
control. Specifically, we propose a condition corruption objective that uses
the representation to denoise a corrupted condition. Minimized by a
discriminator and maximized by the VAE encoder, this objective adversarially
induces a condition-invariant representation. In this paper, we focus on the
task of melody harmonization to illustrate our idea, while our methodology can
be generalized to other controllable generative tasks. Demos and experiments
show that our methodology facilitates not only condition-invariant
representation learning but also higher-quality controllability compared to
baselines.

geographical, temporal, and sequential deterministic reconciliation of
hierarchical photovoltaic (PV) power generation have been considered for a
simulated PV dataset in California. In the first two cases, the reconciliations
are carried out in spatial and temporal domains separately. To further improve
forecasting accuracy, in the third case these two reconciliation approaches are
sequentially applied. During the replication of the forecasting experiment,
some issues emerged about non-negativity and coherence (in space and/or in
time) of the sequentially reconciled forecasts. Furthermore, while the accuracy
improvement of the considered approaches over the benchmark persistence
forecasts is clearly visible at any data granularity, we argue that an even
better performance may be obtained by a thorough exploitation of cross-temporal
hierarchies. In this paper the cross-temporal point forecast reconciliation
approach is applied to generate non-negative, fully coherent (both in space and
time) forecasts. In particular, some relationships between two-step, iterative
and simultaneous cross-temporal reconciliation procedures are for the first
time established, non-negativity issues of the final reconciled forecasts are
correctly dealt with in a simple way, and the most recent cross-temporal
reconciliation approaches are adopted. The normalised Root Mean Square Error is
used to measure forecasting accuracy, and a statistical multiple comparison
procedure is performed to rank the approaches. Besides assuring full coherence,
and non-negativity of the reconciled forecasts, the results show that for the

improves on the sequential procedures proposed by Yagli et al. (2019), at any

holographically added gravitons, which we call massless. Making use of newly
found embedding coordinates, we obtain desired Unruh temperatures and compare
them with the Hawking and local fiducial temperatures, showing that the Unruh
effect for a uniformly accelerated observer in a higher dimensional flat
spacetime is equal to the Hawking effect for a fiducial observer in a black
hole spacetime. We also obtain freely falling temperatures of the HRBHs in
massless and massive gravities seen by freely falling observers, which remain
finite even at the event horizons while becoming the Hawking temperatures in
asymptotic infinity.

sequentially by optimizing a certain feedback. While the mean reward criterion
has been extensively studied, other measures that reflect an aversion to
adverse outcomes, such as mean-variance or conditional value-at-risk (CVaR),
can be of interest for critical applications (healthcare, agriculture).
Algorithms have been proposed for such risk-aware measures under bandit
feedback without contextual information. In this work, we study contextual
bandits where such risk measures can be elicited as linear functions of the
contexts through the minimization of a convex loss. A typical example that fits
within this framework is the expectile measure, which is obtained as the
solution of an asymmetric least-square problem. Using the method of mixtures
for supermartingales, we derive confidence sequences for the estimation of such
risk measures. We then propose an optimistic UCB algorithm to learn optimal
risk-aware actions, with regret guarantees similar to those of generalized
linear bandits. This approach requires solving a convex problem at each round
of the algorithm, which we can relax by allowing only approximated solution
obtained by online gradient descent, at the cost of slightly higher regret. We
conclude by evaluating the resulting algorithms on numerical experiments.

approximations such as mean-field parametrisation to ensure tractability.
However, prior work has associated the variational mean-field approximation for
Bayesian neural networks with underfitting in the case of small datasets or
large model sizes. In this work, we show that invariances in the likelihood
function of over-parametrised models contribute to this phenomenon because
these invariances complicate the structure of the posterior by introducing
discrete and/or continuous modes which cannot be well approximated by Gaussian
mean-field distributions. In particular, we show that the mean-field
approximation has an additional gap in the evidence lower bound compared to a
purpose-built posterior that takes into account the known invariances.
Importantly, this invariance gap is not constant; it vanishes as the
approximation reverts to the prior. We proceed by first considering translation
invariances in a linear model with a single data point in detail. We show that,
while the true posterior can be constructed from a mean-field parametrisation,
this is achieved only if the objective function takes into account the
invariance gap. Then, we transfer our analysis of the linear model to neural
networks. Our analysis provides a framework for future work to explore
solutions to the invariance problem.

focus on signals of the single ionization of $H_2$ under a strong near-infrared
(NIR) four-cycle, linearly-polarized laser pulse of varying intensity, and
within a vibrationally frozen molecule model. The observables we address are
post-pulse total ionization probability profiles as a function of the laser
peak intensity. Three values of the internuclear distance R taken as a
parameter are considered, R = R$_{eq}$ = 1.4 a.u, the equilibrium geometry of
the molecule, R = 5.0 a.u for an elongated molecule and R = 10.2 a.u for a
dissociating molecule. The most striking observation is the non-monotonous
behavior of the ionization probability profiles at intermediate elongation
distances with an instance of enhanced ionization and one of partial ionization
quenching. We give an interpretation of this in terms of a
Resonance-Enhanced-Multiphoton Ionization (REMPI) mechanism with interfering
overlapping resonances resulting from excited electronic states.

quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) of solar flares. Forward modeling their radio
emission is crucial for identifying sausage modes observationally and for
understanding their connections with QPPs. Using the numerical output from
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we forward model the
gyrosynchrotron (GS) emission of flare loops modulated by sausage modes and
examine the influence of loop fine structures. The temporal evolution of the
emission intensity is analyzed for an oblique line of sight crossing the loop
center. We find that the low- and high-frequency intensities oscillate in-phase
at the period of sausage modes for models with or without fine structures. For
low-frequency emissions where the optically thick regime arises, the modulation
magnitude of the intensity is dramatically reduced by the fine structures at
some viewing angles. On the contrary, for high-frequency emissions where the
optically thin regime holds, the effect of fine structures or viewing angle is
marginal. Our results show that the periodic intensity variations of sausage
modes are not wiped out by the fine structures, and sausage modes remains a
promising candidate mechanism for QPPs even when flare loops are
fine-structured.

has to meet. Due to directions from the European Southern Observatory (ESO),
the instrument will be operated only by La Silla staff, with no astronomer

shock acceleration, magnetic reconnection, and turbulence, are expected to have
observable signatures in the multi-wavelength polarization properties of
blazars. The recent launch of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE)
enables us, for the first time, to use polarization in the X-ray band (2-8 keV)
to probe the properties of the jet synchrotron emission in
high-frequency-peaked BL Lac objects (HSPs). We report the discovery of X-ray
linear polarization (degree $\Pi_{\rm x}=15\pm$2\% and electric-vector position
angle $\Psi_{\rm x}=35^\circ\pm4^\circ$) from the jet of the HSP Mrk~421 in an
average X-ray flux state. At the same time, the degree of polarization at
optical, infrared, and millimeter wavelengths was found to be lower by at least
a factor of 3. During the IXPE pointing, the X-ray flux of the source increased
by a factor of 2.2, while the polarization behavior was consistent with no
variability. The higher level of $\Pi_{\rm x}$ compared to longer wavelengths,
and the absence of significant polarization variability, suggest a shock as the
most likely X-ray emission site in the jet of Mrk 421 during the observation.
The multiwavelength polarization properties are consistent with an
energy-stratified electron population, where the particles emitting at longer
wavelengths are located farther from the acceleration site, where they
experience a more disordered magnetic field.

have to exhibit a significant radiation tolerance. Thereby the impact of
radiation on the highly boron-doped gain layer that enables the internal charge
multiplication, is of special interest, since due to the so-called Acceptor
Removal Effect (ARE) a radiation-induced deactivation of active boron dopants
takes place. In this paper we present defect-spectroscopy measurements
(Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy and Thermally Stimulated Current technique)
on neutron irradiated p-type silicon pad diodes of different resistivity as
well as LGADs irradiated at fluences up to 1 x 10^15 neq/cm2. Thereby we show
that while for the silicon pad diodes irradiated with electrons, neutrons or
protons the determination of defect electronic properties and defect
introduction rates is straightforward, DLTS and TSC measurements on LGADs are
strongly influenced by the impact of the gain layer. It is shown that the
measurability of the capacitance of the gain layer shows a strong frequency and
temperature dependence leading to a capacitance drop in DLTS and non-reliable
measurement results. With TSC defects formed in the LGADs can be very nicely
observed and compared to the defects formed in the silicon pad diodes. However
the exact assignment of defects to the gain layer or bulk region remains
challenging and the charge amplification effect of the LGADs impacts the exact
determination of defect concentrations. Additionally, we will demonstrate that
depending on the TSC measurement conditions defect induced residual internal
electric fields are built up in the irradiated LGADs that are influencing the
current signal of carriers emitted from the defect states.

underlying physics of inflation, characterised by $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. We
present the methodology to measure $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ from the Dark Energy
Survey (DES) data using the 2-point angular correlation function (ACF) with
scale-dependent bias. One of the focuses of the work is the integral
constraint. This condition appears when estimating the mean number density of
galaxies from the data and is key in obtaining unbiased $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$
constraints. The methods are analysed for two types of simulations: $\sim 246$
GOLIAT-PNG N-body small area simulations with $f_{\rm NL}$ equal to -100 and
100, and 1952 Gaussian ICE-COLA mocks with $f_{\rm NL}=0$ that follow the DES
angular and redshift distribution. We use the ensemble of GOLIAT-PNG mocks to
show the importance of the integral constraint when measuring PNG, where we
recover the fiducial values of $f_{\rm NL}$ within the $1\sigma$ when including
the integral constraint. In contrast, we found a bias of $\Delta f_{\rm NL}\sim
100$ when not including it. For a DES-like scenario, we forecast a bias of
$\Delta f_{\rm NL} \sim 23$, equivalent to $1.8\sigma$, when not using the IC
for a fiducial value of $f_{\rm NL}=100$. We use the ICE-COLA mocks to validate
our analysis in a realistic DES-like setup finding it robust to different
analysis choices: best-fit estimator, the effect of IC, BAO damping,
covariance, and scale choices. We forecast a measurement of $f_{\rm NL}$ within
$\sigma(f_{\rm NL})=31$ when using the DES-Y3 BAO sample, with the ACF in the
$1\ {\rm deg}<\theta<20\ {\rm deg}$ range.

ram-pressure stripping (RPS) in dense environments, showing spectacular
star-forming knots in their disks and tails. We study the ionized gas
properties of five jellyfish galaxies in massive clusters with Gemini GMOS/IFU
observations: MACSJ0916-JFG1 ($z=0.330$), MACSJ1752-JFG2 ($z=0.353$),
A2744-F0083 ($z=0.303$), MACSJ1258-JFG1 ($z=0.342$), and MACSJ1720-JFG1
($z=0.383$). BPT diagrams show that various mechanisms (star formation, AGN, or
mixed effects) are ionizing gas in these galaxies. Radial velocity
distributions of ionized gas seem to follow disk rotation of galaxies, with the
appearance of a few high-velocity components in the tails as a sign of RPS.
Mean gas velocity dispersion is lower than 50 \kms~in most star-forming regions
except near AGNs or shock-heated regions, indicating that the ionized gas %in
these star-forming regions is dynamically cold. Integrated star formation rates
(SFRs) of these galaxies range from $7~{\rm M_{\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}}}$ to
$35~{\rm M_{\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}}}$ and the tail SFRs are from $0.6~{\rm
M_{\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}}}$ to $16~{\rm M_{\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}}}$, which are much
higher than those of other jellyfish galaxies in the local universe. These high
SFR values imply that RPS triggers intense star formation activity in these
extreme jellyfish galaxies. The phase-space diagrams demonstrate that the
jellyfish galaxies with higher stellar masses and higher host cluster velocity
dispersion are likely to have more enhanced star formation activity. The
jellyfish galaxies in this study have similar gas kinematics and dynamical
states to those in the local universe, but they show a much higher SFR.

exponentially in all scientific fields, including particle physics. The
industry has also developed new powerful tools that, imported into academia,
could revolutionise research. One recent industry development that has not yet
come to the attention of the particle physics community is Collaborative
Learning (CL), a framework that allows training the same ML model with
different datasets. This work explores the potential of CL, testing the library
Colearn with neutrino physics simulation. Colearn, developed by the British
Cambridge-based firm Fetch.AI, enables decentralised machine learning tasks.
Being a blockchain-mediated CL system, it allows multiple stakeholders to build
a shared ML model without needing to rely on a central authority. A generic
Liquid Argon Time-Projection Chamber (LArTPC) has been simulated and images
produced by fictitious neutrino interactions have been used to produce several
datasets. These datasets, called learners, participated successfully in
training a Deep Learning (DL) Keras model using blockchain technologies in a
decentralised way. This test explores the feasibility of training a single ML
model using different simulation datasets coming from different research
groups. In this work, we also discuss a framework that instead makes different
ML models compete against each other on the same dataset. The final goal is
then to train the most performant ML model across the entire scientific
community for a given experiment, either using all of the datasets available or
selecting the model which performs best among every model developed in the
community.

  Segmentation",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Breast tumor segmentation is one of the key steps that helps us characterize
and localize tumor regions. However, variable tumor morphology, blurred
boundary, and similar intensity distributions bring challenges for accurate
segmentation of breast tumors. Recently, many U-net variants have been proposed
and widely used for breast tumors segmentation. However, these architectures
suffer from two limitations: (1) Ignoring the characterize ability of the
benchmark networks, and (2) Introducing extra complex operations increases the
difficulty of understanding and reproducing the network. To alleviate these
challenges, this paper proposes a simple yet powerful nested U-net (NU-net) for
accurate segmentation of breast tumors. The key idea is to utilize U-Nets with
different depths and shared weights to achieve robust characterization of
breast tumors. NU-net mainly has the following advantages: (1) Improving
network adaptability and robustness to breast tumors with different scales, (2)
This method is easy to reproduce and execute, and (3) The extra operations
increase network parameters without significantly increasing computational
cost. Extensive experimental results with twelve state-of-the-art segmentation
methods on three public breast ultrasound datasets demonstrate that NU-net has
more competitive segmentation performance on breast tumors. Furthermore, the
robustness of NU-net is further illustrated on the segmentation of renal
ultrasound images. The source code is publicly available on
https://github.com/CGPzy/NU-net.

in the warm molecular layers of some protoplanetary disks are depleted compared
to those is the interstellar medium by a factor of ~10-100. Meanwhile, little
is known about nitrogen. To investigate the time evolution of nitrogen, carbon,
and oxygen elemental abundances in disks, we develop a one-dimensional model
that incorporates dust settling, turbulent diffusion of dust and ices, as well
as gas-ice chemistry including the chemistry driven by stellar UV/X-rays and
the galactic cosmic rays. We find that gaseous CO in the warm molecular layer
is converted to CO2 ice and locked up near the midplane via the combination of
turbulent mixing (i.e., the vertical cold finger effect) and ice chemistry
driven by stellar UV photons. On the other hand, gaseous N2, the main nitrogen
reservoir in the warm molecular layer, is less processed by ice chemistry, and
exists as it is. Then the nitrogen depletion occurs solely by the vertical cold
finger effect of N2. As the binding energy of N2 is lower than that of CO and
CO2, the degree of nitrogen depletion is smaller than that of carbon and oxygen
depletion, leading to higher elemental abundance of nitrogen than that of
carbon and oxygen. This evolution occurs within 1 Myr and proceeds further,
when the $\alpha$ parameter for the diffusion coefficient is ~0.001.
Consequently, the N2H+/CO column density ratio increases with time. How the
vertical transport affects the midplane ice composition is briefly discussed.

simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Landmark management is necessary
in order to maintain a consistent map of the estimated landmarks relative to
the estimate of the platform's pose. This task is particularly important when
faced with multiple detections from the same landmark and/or dynamic
environments where the location of a landmark can change. A further challenge
with radar data is the presence of false detections. Accordingly, we propose a
simple yet efficient rule based solution for radar SLAM landmark management.
Assuming a low-dynamic environment, there are several steps in our solution:
new landmarks need to be detected and included, false landmarks need to be
identified and removed, and the consistency of the landmarks registered in the
map needs to be maintained. To illustrate our solution, we run an extended
Kalman filter SLAM algorithm in an environment containing both stationary and
temporally stationary landmarks. Our simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed solution is capable of reliably managing landmarks even when faced
with false detections and multiple detections from the same landmark.

darkweb. Over the last five years alone, the number of onion domains has
increased 20x, reaching more than 700k unique domains in January 2022. As onion
services host various types of illicit content, they have become a valuable
resource for darkweb research and an integral part of e-crime investigation and
threat intelligence. However, this content is largely un-indexed by today's
search engines and researchers have to rely on outdated or manually-collected
datasets that are limited in scale, scope, or both.
  To tackle this problem, we built Dizzy: An open-source crawling and analysis
system for onion services. Dizzy implements novel techniques to explore,
update, check, and classify onion services at scale, without overwhelming the
Tor network. We deployed Dizzy in April 2021 and used it to analyze more than
63.3m crawled onion webpages, focusing on domain operations, web content,
cryptocurrency usage, and web graph. Our main findings show that onion services
are unreliable due to their high churn rate, have a relatively small number of
reachable domains that are often similar and illicit, enjoy a growing
underground cryptocurrency economy, and have a graph that is relatively
tightly-knit to, but topologically different from, the regular web's graph.

angular momentum $J=2$ with spin-triplet and $P$-wave are believed to be
realized in neutron star cores. Within the Ginzburg-Landau theory it was
previously found that a singly quantized vortex is split into two
half-quantized non-Abelian vortices connected by one (or three) soliton(s)
forming a vortex molecule with the soliton bond(s), in the absence (presence)
of magnetic field parallel to them. In this paper, we investigate proximity
effects of two vortex molecules by exhausting all possible two vortex molecule
states consisting of four half-quantized vortices and determining the phase
diagram spanned by the magnetic field and rotation speed. As the rotation speed
is increased, the distance between the two vortex molecules becomes shorter. In
the magnetic field below the critical value, we find that as the rotation speed
is increased, the two separated vortex molecules transit to a dimerized vortex
molecule, where the two vortex molecules are bridged by two solitons that we
call ""covalent bonds"" in analogy with chemical molecules. We also find that the
orders of the constituent half-quantized vortex cores transit from a
ferromagnetic order to a cyclic order as the vortex molecules come closer. On
the other hand, no dimerization occurs in the magnetic field above the critical
value. Instead, we find a transition for the polarization direction of the
vortex molecules from a configuration parallel to the separation to one
perpendicular to the separation as they come closer. We also show some examples
of three and four vortex molecule states.

estimation in robot swarms, clock synchronization for processor networks, and
data fusion. One characteristic is that agents only have access to noisy
measurements of deviations between their own and neighboring states. Still,
estimations of their actual state can be obtained in a fully distributed manner
using algorithms such as affine averaging. However, running this algorithm,
requires that the agents exchange their current state estimations, which can be
a privacy issue (since they eventually reveal the actual states). To counteract
this threat, we propose an encrypted version of the affine averaging algorithm
in this paper. More precisely, we use homomorphic encryption to realize an
encrypted implementation, where only one ``leader'' agent has access to its
state estimation in plaintext. One main challenge (which often arises for
recursive encrypted computations) is to prevent overflow w.r.t.~the bounded
message space of the cryptosystem. We solve this problem by periodically
resetting the agents' states with the help of the leader. We study the
resulting system dynamics with respect to different reset strategies and
support our findings with extensive numerical simulations.

significant to understand its vulnerability, i.e., whether the system can still
maintain normal operations when facing operational disturbances with different
magnitudes. To this end, this paper proposes a network vulnerability assessment
method with the joint consideration of static network topology and dynamic
travel demand. The method includes an accessibility-based identification of
station importance with time-varying passenger demand and a new dynamic
vulnerability evaluation index. An empirical analysis is carried out by taking
the rail transit system of Beijing, China as an example. Results show that the
distribution of high-importance stations varies with the time of day, affected
by both static topology and hourly-changing passenger flow. Under the
disturbance of operation delay, the impact of high-importance stations on the
network vulnerability changes with the increase of delayed travel demand. It is
also found that some stations that serve as bridges (i.e., reasonable paths
link the origin station and destination) and are visited by large passenger
flow have the greatest impact on network vulnerability. Network performance
degradation is obviously segmented and stratified in the case of interval
continuous failure. The disruption between different lines is the main reason
for system performance degradation, and some important stations within the line
will act as catalysts to accelerate the performance degradation. This method
provides a reference for measuring dynamic passenger flow-related network
vulnerability and supplies the field with a new vulnerability evaluation index.

  function of aphelia, following Lagrange's formulation",,,,,"physics.geo-ph astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Earth rotation is determined by polar motion (PM) and length of day (lod).
The excitation sources of PM are torques linked to fluid circulations
(""geophysical excitations""), and those of lod to luni-solar tides
(""astronomical excitations""). We explore the links between the rotations and
revolutions of planets, following Lagrange's (1853) presentation of mechanics.
The energy of a planet in motion in a central field is the sum of kinetic,
centrifugal (planet dependent) and centripetal (identical for all planets)
energies. For each planet, one can calculate a ""constant of gravitation"" Gp .
For the giant planets, Gp decreases as a function of aphelia. There is no such
organized behavior for the terrestrial planets. The perturbing potential of
other planets generates a small angular contribution to the displacement : this
happens to be identical to Einstein's famous formula for precession. Delays in
the planet's perihelia follow a (-5/2) power law of a. This is readily
understood in the Lagrange formalism (the centrifugal term takes over for small
distances). The telluric planets have lost energy, probably transferred to the
planets rotations. The ratio of areal velocities to rotation obeys a -5/2 power
law of a. The ratio of areal velocity to integrated period R also fits a -5/2
power dependence, implying linearity of the energy exchange between revolution
and rotation. For Einstein deformation of space-time by the Sun is the origin
of the field perturbation. For Lagrange the perturbation could only be due to
the interactions of torques. The perihelion delays, the areal velocities and
the planetary rotations display power laws of aphelia, whose behavior contrasts
with that of the kinetic moment. The areal velocity being linearly linked to
the kinetic moment of planets, this must be the level at which the transfer is
achieved.

projection when the status of elements in the environment in the near future is

Persistent Threat (APT) requires predicting the next step of the APT. The
threats are constantly changing and becoming more complex. As supervised and
unsupervised learning methods require APT datasets for projecting the next step
of APTs, they are unable to identify unknown APT threats. In reinforcement
learning methods, the agent interacts with the environment, and so it might
project the next step of known and unknown APTs. So far, reinforcement learning
has not been used to project the next step for APTs. In reinforcement learning,
the agent uses the previous states and actions to approximate the best action
of the current state. When the number of states and actions is abundant, the
agent employs a neural network which is called deep learning to approximate the
best action of each state. In this paper, we present a deep reinforcement

branching Brownian particles. The conservation of $N$ is provided by a modified
branching process. When a particle branches into two particles, the particle
which is farthest from the origin is eliminated simultaneously. The spatial
density of the particles is governed by the solution of a free boundary problem
for a reaction-diffusion equation in the limit of $N \gg 1$. At long times, the
particle density approaches a spherically symmetric steady state solution with
a compact support of radius $\bar{\ell}_0$. However, at finite $N$, the radius
of this support, $L$, fluctuates. The variance of these fluctuations appears to
exhibit a logarithmic anomaly [Siboni {\em et al}., Phys. Rev. E. {\bf104},
054131 (2021)]. It is proportional to $N^{-1}\ln N$ at $N\to\infty$. We
investigate here the tails of the probability density function (PDF), $P(L)$,
of the swarm radius, when the absolute value of the radius fluctuation $\Delta
L=L-\bar{\ell}_0$ is sufficiently larger than the typical fluctuations' scale
determined by the variance. For negative deviations the PDF can be obtained in
the framework of the optimal fluctuation method (OFM). This part of the PDF
displays the scaling behavior: $\ln P\propto - N \Delta L^2\, \ln^{-1}(\Delta
L^{-2})$, demonstrating a logarithmic anomaly at small negative $\Delta L$. For
the opposite sign of the fluctuation, $\Delta L > 0$, the PDF can be obtained
with an approximation of a single particle, running away. We find that $\ln P
\propto -N^{1/2}\Delta L$. We consider in this paper only the case, when
$|\Delta L|$ is much less than the typical radius of the swarm at $N\gg 1$.

the deep learning community. To evaluate whether this commitment is justified,
the influence of computing precision (single and double precision) on the
optimization performance of the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method (a second-order
optimization algorithm) and RMSprop (a first-order algorithm) has been
investigated. Tests of neural networks with one to five fully connected hidden
layers and moderate or strong nonlinearity with up to 4 million network
parameters have been optimized for Mean Square Error (MSE). The training tasks
have been set up so that their MSE minimum was known to be zero. Computing
experiments have disclosed that single-precision can keep up (with superlinear
convergence) with double-precision as long as line search finds an improvement.
First-order methods such as RMSprop do not benefit from double precision.
However, for moderately nonlinear tasks, CG is clearly superior. For strongly
nonlinear tasks, both algorithm classes find only solutions fairly poor in
terms of mean square error as related to the output variance. CG with double
floating-point precision is superior whenever the solutions have the potential
to be useful for the application goal.

  Face Misalignment","14 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For the past decades, face recognition (FR) has been actively studied in
computer vision and pattern recognition society. Recently, due to the advances
in deep learning, the FR technology shows high performance for most of the
benchmark datasets. However, when the FR algorithm is applied to a real-world
scenario, the performance has been known to be still unsatisfactory. This is
mainly attributed to the mismatch between training and testing sets. Among such
mismatches, face misalignment between training and testing faces is one of the
factors that hinder successful FR. To address this limitation, we propose a
face shape-guided deep feature alignment framework for FR robust to the face
misalignment. Based on a face shape prior (e.g., face keypoints), we train the
proposed deep network by introducing alignment processes, i.e., pixel and
feature alignments, between well-aligned and misaligned face images. Through
the pixel alignment process that decodes the aggregated feature extracted from
a face image and face shape prior, we add the auxiliary task to reconstruct the
well-aligned face image. Since the aggregated features are linked to the face
feature extraction network as a guide via the feature alignment process, we
train the robust face feature to the face misalignment. Even if the face shape
estimation is required in the training stage, the additional face alignment
process, which is usually incorporated in the conventional FR pipeline, is not
necessarily needed in the testing phase. Through the comparative experiments,
we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the face misalignment
with the FR datasets.

of heads and the number of transformers can be chosen. If the role of context
in images to be classified can be assumed to be small, it is favorable to use
multiple transformers with a low number of heads (such as one or two). In
classifying objects whose class may heavily depend on the context within the

the scientific and philosophical aspects, a theory of parts forming a whole is
a complex issue, loaded with controversies that are widely discussed. This
paper aims to offer a semantic assembly model that is useful to describe WP

conducting an ontological analysis using UML samples that exemplify the WP
construct. The method of investigation is based on a model called a thinging
machine (TM) to explore the WP semantics through applying TM to numerous
existing UML models. The TM model uses the so-called thimacs (things/machines)
to form building blocks for describing the domain at a three levels of
description: static, events, and behavioral models. This approach contrasts the
UML method, which is infected by a multiplicity problem concerning the

high-speed and high-capacity data service demands. However, THz-communication
losses arise owing to limitations, i.e., molecular absorption, rain
attenuation, and coverage range. Furthermore, to maintain steady
THz-communications and overcome coverage distances in rural and suburban
regions, the required number of BSs is very high. Consequently, a new
communication platform that enables aerial communication services is required.
Furthermore, the airborne platform supports LoS communications rather than NLoS
communications, which helps overcome these losses. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate the deployment and resource optimization for MEC-enabled UAVs,
which can provide THz-based communications in remote regions. To this end, we
formulate an optimization problem to minimize the sum of the energy consumption
of both MEC-UAV and MUs and the delay incurred by MUs under the given task
information. The formulated problem is a MINLP problem, which is NP-hard. We
decompose the main problem into two subproblems to address the formulated
problem. We solve the first subproblem with a standard optimization solver,
i.e., CVXPY, due to its convex nature. To solve the second subproblem, we
design a RMAPPO DRL algorithm with an attention mechanism. The considered
attention mechanism is utilized for encoding a diverse number of observations.
This is designed by the network coordinator to provide a differentiated fit
reward to each agent in the network. The simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark and yields a network utility which
is $2.22\%$, $15.55\%$, and $17.77\%$ more than the benchmarks.

their mass. Furthermore, the results of our study suggest that at a
sufficiently high resolution simulation, Hermeian haloes may be found around
almost every halo, making them interesting for studies of matter exchange

of eigenvalue zero of general Laplacian matrix $L^*$ is shown to be determined
by the sum of the numbers of zero circles, identical nodes and opposite pairs,
while it is always simple for the Laplacian $L$ with diagonal entries in
absolute form. For a fixed structurally balanced topology, the controllable
subspace is proved to be invariant even if the antagonistic weights are
selected differently under the corresponding protocol with $L$. For a graph
expanded from a star graph rooted from a single leader, the dimension of
controllable subspace is two under the protocol associated with $L^*$. In
addition, the system is structurally controllable under both protocols if and

case of structural controllability, strong structural controllability requires
the system to be controllable for any choice of weights. The connection between
father nodes and child nodes affects strong structural controllability because
it determines the linear relationship of the control information from father
nodes. This discovery is a major factor in establishing the sufficient

(XCA) image sequence has important clinical significance for intuitively
diagnosis and therapy. In this study, the XCA image sequence is regarded as a
3D tensor input, the vessel layer is regarded as a sparse tensor, and the
background layer is regarded as a low-rank tensor. Using tensor nuclear norm
(TNN) minimization, a novel method for vessel layer extraction based on tensor
robust principal component analysis (TRPCA) is proposed. Furthermore,
considering the irregular movement of vessels and the low-frequency dynamic
disturbance of surrounding irrelevant tissues, the total variation (TV)
regularized spatial-temporal constraint is introduced to smooth the foreground
layer. Subsequently, for vessel layer images with uneven contrast distribution,
a two-stage region growing (TSRG) method is utilized for vessel enhancement and
segmentation. A global threshold method is used as the preprocessing to obtain
main branches, and the Radon-Like features (RLF) filter is used to enhance and
connect broken minor segments, the final binary vessel mask is constructed by
combining the two intermediate results. The visibility of TV-TRPCA algorithm
for foreground extraction is evaluated on clinical XCA image sequences and
third-party dataset, which can effectively improve the performance of commonly
used vessel segmentation algorithms. Based on TV-TRPCA, the accuracy of TSRG
algorithm for vessel segmentation is further evaluated. Both qualitative and
quantitative results validate the superiority of the proposed method over
existing state-of-the-art approaches.

state-of-the-art neural architectures. Despite the progress achieved with NAS,
so far there is little attention to theoretical guarantees on NAS. In this
work, we study the generalization properties of NAS under a unifying framework
enabling (deep) layer skip connection search and activation function search. To
this end, we derive the lower (and upper) bounds of the minimum eigenvalue of
the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) under the (in)finite-width regime using a
certain search space including mixed activation functions, fully connected, and
residual neural networks. We use the minimum eigenvalue to establish
generalization error bounds of NAS in the stochastic gradient descent training.
Importantly, we theoretically and experimentally show how the derived results
can guide NAS to select the top-performing architectures, even in the case
without training, leading to a train-free algorithm based on our theory.
Accordingly, our numerical validation shed light on the design of
computationally efficient methods for NAS. Our analysis is non-trivial due to
the coupling of various architectures and activation functions under the
unifying framework and has its own interest in providing the lower bound of the
minimum eigenvalue of NTK in deep learning theory.

controllers, viz., the exponential stabilizer (ES) based on the stochastic
Lyapunov theory and the asymptotic stabilizer (AS) based on the stochastic
asymptotic stability theory. The ES can render the controlled systems
exponentially convergent but it requires a long computational time; conversely,
the AS makes the training much faster but it can only assure the asymptotic
(not the exponential) attractiveness of the control targets. These two
stochastic controllers thus are complementary in applications. We also
investigate rigorously the linear controller and the proposed neural stochastic
controllers in both convergence time and energy cost and numerically compare
them in these two indexes. More significantly, we use several representative
physical systems to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed controllers in
stabilization of dynamical systems.

potential $\mu_B$ is an oft-used method to circumvent the well-known sign
problem of Lattice QCD. Owing to the associated difficulty and limitations of
precision in calculating these high-ordered Taylor coefficients, it becomes
essential to look for various resummation schemes which can mitigate the
computational cost, besides providing trustworthy estimates of different
thermodynamic observables. Recently, a way to exponentially resum the
contribution of the first $N$ charge density correlation functions
$D_1,\dots,D_N$ to the Taylor series to all orders in $\mu_B$ was proposed in
Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 2, 022001 (2022). Since the correlation functions $D_n$
are calculated stochastically using estimates from different random volume
sources, the resummation formulation gets affected by the biased estimates.
These estimates can become very drastic and can radically misdirect the
calculations for large values of $N$ and $\mu$ and also for observables which
are higher order $\mu$ derivatives of free energy, specially at lower
temperatures. In this work, we present a cumulant expansion procedure that
allows to investigate and regulate these biased estimates at different orders
in $\mu$. We find that the unbiased estimates in the cumulant expansion can
truly capture the genuine higher-order stochastic fluctuations of the higher
order correlation functions, which got suppressed by the exponential
resummation formulation. Finally, we discover an unbiased formalism of the
exponential resummation, which when expanded in a series, can exactly reproduce
the Taylor series upto a desired power in $\mu$. We are also able to regain the
knowledge of reweighting factor and many other important properties of the
partition function, which got entirely lost through the implementation of
cumulant expansion scheme.

  optimization for fair misinformation detection",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CY math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Multiple-objective optimization (MOO) aims to simultaneously optimize
multiple conflicting objectives and has found important applications in machine
learning, such as minimizing classification loss and discrepancy in treating
different populations for fairness. At optimality, further optimizing one
objective will necessarily harm at least another objective, and decision-makers
need to comprehensively explore multiple optima (called Pareto front) to
pinpoint one final solution. We address the efficiency of finding the Pareto
front. First, finding the front from scratch using stochastic multi-gradient
descent (SMGD) is expensive with large neural networks and datasets. We propose
to explore the Pareto front as a manifold from a few initial optima, based on a
predictor-corrector method. Second, for each exploration step, the predictor
solves a large-scale linear system that scales quadratically in the number of
model parameters and requires one backpropagation to evaluate a second-order
Hessian-vector product per iteration of the solver. We propose a Gauss-Newton
approximation that only scales linearly, and that requires only first-order
inner-product per iteration. This also allows for a choice between the MINRES
and conjugate gradient methods when approximately solving the linear system.
The innovations make predictor-corrector possible for large networks.
Experiments on multi-objective (fairness and accuracy) misinformation detection
tasks show that 1) the predictor-corrector method can find Pareto fronts better
than or similar to SMGD with less time; and 2) the proposed first-order method
does not harm the quality of the Pareto front identified by the second-order
method, while further reduce running time.

concentration, however, drives $b_1$ and $b_\phi$ in opposite directions. This
induces significant changes to the $b_\phi(b_1)$ relation, with higher
concentration halos having higher amplitude of $b_\phi(b_1)$. For $z=0.5$ and
$b_1 \approx 2$ in particular, the population comprising either all halos,
those with the $33\%$ lowest or those with the $33\%$ highest concentrations
have a PNG bias of $b_\phi \approx 3$, $b_\phi \approx -1$ and $b_\phi \approx

clustering constraints of the local PNG parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ that assume
fixed forms for the $b_\phi(b_1)$ relation. We illustrate the significant

(QSOs) in the South. Among them, the QUasars as BRIght beacons for Cosmology in
the Southern hemisphere (QUBRICS) survey has now delivered hundreds of new
spectroscopically confirmed QSOs selected by means of machine learning
algorithms. Building upon the results obtained by introducing the probabilistic
random forest (PRF) for the QUBRICS selection, we explore in this work the
feasibility of training the algorithm on synthetic data to improve the
completeness in the higher redshift bins. We also compare the performances of
the algorithm if colours are used as primary features instead of magnitudes. We
generate synthetic data based on a composite QSO spectral energy distribution.
We first train the PRF to identify QSOs among stars and galaxies, then separate
high-z quasar from low-z contaminants. We apply the algorithm on an updated
dataset, based on SkyMapper DR3, combined with Gaia eDR3, 2MASS and WISE
magnitudes. We find that employing colours as features slightly improves the
results with respect to the algorithm trained on magnitude data. Adding
synthetic data to the training set provides significantly better results with
respect to the PRF trained only on spectroscopically confirmed QSOs. We
estimate, on a testing dataset, a completeness of ~86% and a contamination of
~36%. Finally, 207 PRF-selected candidates were observed: 149/207 turned out to
be genuine QSOs with z > 2.5, 41 with z < 2.5, 3 galaxies and 14 stars. The
result confirms the ability of the PRF to select high-z quasars in large
datasets.

cross-attention mechanism. Recent studies have shown that explicitly modeling
the input graph structure can significantly improve the performance. However,
the vanilla structural encoder cannot capture all specialized information in a
single forward pass for all decoding steps, resulting in inaccurate semantic
representations. Meanwhile, the input graph is flatted as an unordered sequence
in the cross attention, ignoring the original graph structure. As a result, the
obtained input graph context vector in the decoder may be flawed. To address
these issues, we propose a Structure-Aware Cross-Attention (SACA) mechanism to
re-encode the input graph representation conditioning on the newly generated
context at each decoding step in a structure aware manner. We further adapt
SACA and introduce its variant Dynamic Graph Pruning (DGP) mechanism to
dynamically drop irrelevant nodes in the decoding process. We achieve new
state-of-the-art results on two graph-to-text datasets, LDC2020T02 and
ENT-DESC, with only minor increase on computational cost.

themselves in the PES and RIXS signals. In particular, we find that charge
carriers created on the B sublattice migrate to the A sublattice, where they
contribute to the creation of in-gap states in the PES signal, and to
characteristic peaks in the nonequilibrium RIXS spectrum. While the
contributions from the two sublattices cannot be easily distinguished in the

mitigate the apparent discrepancy between the simulations and the KaVA

Takahashi. consistently solving the trans-magnetic field structure but
neglecting any dissipation effects. By comparing the jet model with the
observed M87 jet velocity profile, we find that the model can reproduce the
logarithmic feature of the velocity profile, and can fit the observed data when
choosing $c/(100r_{g}) \lesssim \Omega_{F} \lesssim c/(70r_{g})$ where $r_{g}$
is the gravitational radius. While a total specific energy (${\cal E}$) of the
jet changes the terminal bulk Lorentz factor of the jet, a slower angular
velocity of the black hole magnetosphere (funnel region) ($\Omega_{F}$) makes a
light-cylinder radius ($r_{\rm lc}$) larger and it consequently pushes out a
location of a starting point of the jet acceleration. Using the estimated
$\Omega_{F}$ we further estimate the magnetic field strength on the event
horizon scale in M87 by assuming Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process is in action.
The corresponding magnetic flux threading the event horizon of M87 is in good

exploits the prosperous advances in deep learning by training an equalizer with
an adversarial network. The learning is only based on the statistics of the

agnostic to the channel model. The proposed approach is independent of the

equalizers. In this work, we prove this concept in simulations of different --

multi-band structures when the electrons can be described by an effective
single-band Hamiltonian, affects the superconducting properties of
two-dimensional electronic systems. Generically the Berry curvature is coupled
to electric fields beyond those created by the periodic crystal potential. A
potential source of such electric fields, which vary slowly on the lattice
scale, is the mutual interaction between the electrons. We show that the Berry
curvature provides additional terms in the Hamiltonian describing interacting
electrons within a single band. When these terms are taken into account in the
framework of the usual BCS weak-coupling treatment of a generic attractive
interaction that allows for the formation of Cooper pairs, the coupling
constant is modified. In pure singlet and triplet superconductors, we find that
the Berry curvature generally lowers the coupling constant and thus the
superconducting gap and the critical temperature as a function of doping. From
an experimental point of view, a measured deviation from the expected BCS
critical temperature upon doping, e.g. in doped two-dimensional
transition-metal dichalcogenides, may unveil the strength of the Berry

shaping in value-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We show that reward
shifting in the form of the linear transformation is equivalent to changing the
initialization of the $Q$-function in function approximation. Based on such an
equivalence, we bring the key insight that a positive reward shifting leads to
conservative exploitation, while a negative reward shifting leads to
curiosity-driven exploration. Accordingly, conservative exploitation improves
offline RL value estimation, and optimistic value estimation improves
exploration for online RL. We validate our insight on a range of RL tasks and
show its improvement over baselines: (1) In offline RL, the conservative
exploitation leads to improved performance based on off-the-shelf algorithms;
(2) In online continuous control, multiple value functions with different
shifting constants can be used to tackle the exploration-exploitation dilemma
for better sample efficiency; (3) In discrete control tasks, a negative reward
shifting yields an improvement over the curiosity-based exploration method.

patterning during early development. The classical mechanism of morphogen
gradient formation involves the diffusion of morphogens away from a localized
source combined with some form of bulk absorption. Morphogen gradient formation
plays a crucial role during early development, whereby a spatially varying
concentration of morphogen protein drives a corresponding spatial variation in
gene expression during embryogenesis. In most models, the absorption rate is
taken to be a constant multiple of the local concentration. In this paper, we
explore a more general class of diffusion-based model in which absorption is
formulated probabilistically in terms of a stopping time condition. Absorption
of each particle occurs when its time spent within the bulk domain (occupation
time) exceeds a randomly distributed threshold $a$; the classical model with a
constant rate of absorption is recovered by taking the threshold distribution
$\Psi(a)=\e^{-\kappa_0 a}$. We explore how the choice of $\Psi(a)$ affects the
steady-state concentration gradient, and the relaxation to steady-state as
determined by the accumulation time. In particular, we show that the more
general model can generate similar concentration profiles to the classical
case, while significantly reducing the accumulation time.

severely underestimate the rate of side reactions experienced by the cell. We
show, for example, that a same rate of SEI growth would cause faster capacity

surface absorption to the case of an unbiased run-and-tumble particle (RTP)
confined to a finite interval $[0,L]$ and switching between two constant
velocity states $\pm v$ at a rate $\alpha$. The encounter-based formalism is
motivated by the observation that various surface-based reactions are better
modeled in terms of a reactivity that is a function of the amount of time that
a particle spends in a neighborhood of an absorbing surface, which is specified
by a functional known as the boundary local time. The effects of surface
reactions are taken into account by identifying the first passage time (FPT)
for absorption with the event that the local time crosses some random threshold
$\widehat{\ell}$. In the case of a Brownian particle, the local time $\ell(t)$
is a continuous non-decreasing function of the time $t$. Taking
$\Psi(\ell)\equiv \P[\widehat{\ell}>\ell]$ to be an exponential distribution,
$\Psi[\ell]=\e^{-\kappa_0\ell}$, is equivalent to imposing a Robin boundary
condition with a constant rate of absorption $\kappa_0$. One major difference
in the encounter-based model of an RTP is that the boundary local time
$\ell(t)$ is a now a discrete random variable that counts the number of
collisions of the RTP with the boundary. Given this modification, we show that
in the case of a geometric distribution $\Psi(\ell)=z^{\ell}$,
$z=1/(1+\kappa_0/v)$, we recover the RTP analog of the Robin boundary
condition. This allows us to solve the boundary value problem (BVP) for the
joint probability density for particle position and the local time, and thus
incorporate more general models of absorption based on non-geometric
distributions $\Psi(\ell)$.

real. The real-valued pseudo entropy has promising applications in holography
and quantum phase transition. We apply the notion of pseudo-Hermticity to
formulate the reality condition of pseudo entropy. We find the general form of
the transition matrix for which the eigenvalues of the reduced transition
matrix possess real or complex pairs of eigenvalues. Further, we construct a
class of transition matrices for which the pseudo (R\'enyi) entropies are
non-negative. Some known examples which give real pseudo entropy in quantum
field theories can be explained in our framework. Our results offer a novel
method to generate the transition matrix with real pseudo entropy. Finally, we
show the reality condition for pseudo entropy is related to the Tomita-Takesaki
modular theory for quantum field theory.

  Insights from Multi-Scale Molecular Dynamics Simulations",,,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transfer of excitation energy is a key step in light harvesting and hence of
technological relevance for solar energy conversion. In bare organic materials
energy transfer proceeds via incoherent hops, which restrict propagation
lengths to nanometers. In contrast, energy transport over several micrometers
has been observed in the strong coupling regime where excitations hybridise
with confined light modes to form polaritons. Because polaritons have group
velocity, their propagation should be ballistic and long-ranged. However,
experiments indicate that organic polaritons propagate in a diffusive manner
and more slowly than their group velocity. Here, we resolve this controversy by
means of molecular dynamics simulations of Rhodamine molecules in a
Fabry-P\'erot cavity. Our results suggest that polariton propagation is limited
by the cavity lifetime and appears diffusive due to reversible population
transfers between bright polaritonic states that propagate ballistically at
their group velocity, and dark states that are stationary. Furthermore, because
long-lived dark states transiently trap the excitation, propagation is observed
on timescales beyond the intrinsic polariton lifetime. These atomistic insights
not only help to better understand and interpret experimental observations, but
also pave the way towards rational design of molecule-cavity systems for
achieving coherent long-range energy transport.

Schr\""odinger equation for isolated macroscopic bodies, composite states of
e.g., $N\sim 10^{25}, 10^{51}, \ldots$ atoms and molecules, at finite body
temperatures. We first review three aspects of quantum mechanics (QM) in this
context: (i) Heisenberg's uncertainty relations for their center of mass (CM),
(ii) the diffusion of the C.M. wave packet, and (iii) a finite body-temperature
which implies a metastable (mixed-) state of the body: photon emissions and
self-decoherence. They explain the origin of the classical trajectory for a
macroscopic body. The ratio between the range $R_q$ over which the quantum
fluctuations of its CM are effective, and the body's (linear) size $L_0$, $R_q
/L_0 \lesssim 1$ or $R_q/ L_0 \gg 1$, tells whether the body's CM behaves
classically or quantum mechanically, respectively. In the first case, Newton's
force law for its CM follows from the Ehrenfest theorem. We illustrate this for
weak gravitational forces, a harmonic-oscillator potential, and for constant
external electromagnetic fields slowly varying in space. The derivation of the
canonical Hamilton equations for many-body systems is also discussed. Effects
due to the body's finite size such as the gravitational tidal forces appear in
perturbation theory. Our work is consistent with the well-known idea that the
emergence of classical physics in QM is due to the environment-induced
decoherence, but complements and completes it, by clarifying the conditions
under which Newton's equations follow from QM, and by deriving them explicitly.

review, we report on the signatory details of bismuth bonding in several
crystalline systems, along with other non-covalent interactions such as
hydrogen and halogen bonds, which are important driving forces in the rational
design of various types of materials. Illustrative crystal structures were

multiscale finite element analysis (FE$^2$) due to the exceedingly high
computational costs often associated with it and the high number of similar
micromechanical analyses involved. To tackle the issue, using surrogate models
to approximate the microscopic behavior and accelerate the simulations is a
promising and increasingly popular strategy. However, several challenges
related to their data-driven nature compromise the reliability of surrogate
models in material modeling. The alternative explored in this work is to
reintroduce some of the physics-based knowledge of classical constitutive
modeling into a neural network by employing the actual material models used in
the full-order micromodel to introduce non-linearity. Thus, path-dependency
arises naturally since every material model in the layer keeps track of its own
internal variables. For the numerical examples, a composite Representative
Volume Element with elastic fibers and elasto-plastic matrix material is used
as the microscopic model. The network is tested in a series of challenging
scenarios and its performance is compared to that of a state-of-the-art
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A remarkable outcome of the novel framework is
the ability to naturally predict unloading/reloading behavior without ever
seeing it during training, a stark contrast with popular but data-hungry models
such as RNNs. Finally, the proposed network is applied to FE$^2$ examples to
assess its robustness for application in nonlinear finite element analysis.

circumvent the nonconvexity and nonseparability of the problem under
consideration, we accordingly introduce a Unified Bregman Alternating
Minimization Algorithm (UBAMA) by maximally exploiting the favorable DC
structure of the objective. Specifically, we first follow the spirit of
alternating minimization to update each block variable in a sequential order,
which can efficiently tackle the nonseparablitity caused by the coupled
function. Then, we employ the Fenchel-Young inequality to approximate the
second DC components (i.e., concave parts) so that each subproblem becomes a
convex optimization problem, thereby alleviating the computational burden of
the nonconvex DC parts. Moreover, each subproblem absorbs a Bregman proximal
regularization term, which is usually beneficial for inducing closed-form
solutions of subproblems for many cases via choosing appropriate Bregman
functions. It is remarkable that our algorithm not only covers some existing
algorithms, but also enjoys implementable schemes with easier subproblems than
some state-of-the-art first-order algorithms developed for generic nonconvex
and nonsmooth optimization problems. Theoretically, we prove that the sequence
generated by our algorithm converges to a critical point under the

multitask ML models as a sequence of extensions and generalizations. We first
analyze the capabilities of the proposed method by using the standard ML
empirical evaluation methodology. Finally, we propose a novel continuous
development methodology that allows to dynamically extend a pre-existing
multitask large-scale ML system while analyzing the properties of the proposed
method extensions. This results in the generation of an ML model capable of
jointly solving 124 image classification tasks achieving state of the art
quality with improved size and compute cost.

collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016-2018, with an
integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. Events are separated into
single-lepton, same-sign charge dilepton, and multilepton channels. In the
analysis of the single-lepton channel a multilayer neural network and jet

same-sign dilepton and multilepton channels rely on the high-energy signature
of the signal to distinguish it from standard model backgrounds. The data are
consistent with standard model background predictions, and the production of
vector-like quark pairs is excluded at 95% confidence level for T quark masses
up to 1.54 TeV and B quark masses up to 1.56 TeV, depending on the branching
fractions assumed, with maximal sensitivity to decay modes that include
multiple top quarks. The limits obtained in this search are the strongest

particularly on future singularities with the discovery of late-time
acceleration of the universe and dark energy. Recent work has seen a proper
classification of such singularities into strong and weak based on their
strength, with weak singularities being the likes of sudden, w and big freeze
singularities and strong singularities like the big rip. This has led to a
classification of such singularities in various types like Big rip is Type 1,
w-singularity is type V etc. While singularities of type I-type IV have been
discussed vividly by taking into account inhomogeneous equations of state
(EOS), the same has not been attempted for type V singularities. So in this
work we have discussed in detail about the formation of type V singularities in
various cosmologies after considering inhomogeneous equations of state. We
consider two inhomogeneous forms of the EOS in the context of four different
cosmological backgrounds ; standard general relativistic cosmology, an
asymptotically safe cosmology, a cosmology inspired by modified area-entropy
relations, generalized uncertainty principles, holographic renormalization and
Chern-Simons gravity( all of which can be coincidentally described by the same
form of the modified Friedmann equation) and an f(R) gravity cosmology. We show
in detail that one sees some very big differences in the occurence conditions
of type V singularities when one makes such considerations. In the particular
case of the f(R) gravity cosmology, we see that the type V singularities get
completely removed. This work goes to show that the creation and formation of
type V singularities is influenced most strongly by the form of the equation of
state that one considers, way more so than what background cosmology one
chooses.

two distinct quantum critical points as the generalized Wigner crystal transits

of a critical intermediate phase. The quantum two-stage criticality evolves
into a quantum pseudo criticality as a high parallel magnetic field is applied.
In such pseudo criticality, we find that the quantum critical scaling is only
valid above a critical temperature, indicating a weak first-order QPT therein.

consists of a zonal differential rotation and a toroidal magnetic field is
present. Semicircle rules that prescribe the possible domain of the wave
velocity in the complex plane for general flow and field profiles are derived.
The paper then sets out an analytical study of the `clamshell instability',
which features field lines on the two hemispheres tilting in opposite
directions (Cally 2001, Sol. Phys. vol. 199, pp. 231--249). An asymptotic
solution for the instability problem is derived for the limit of weak shear of
the zonal flow, via the method of matched asymptotic expansions. It is shown
that when the zonal flow is solid body rotation, there exists a neutral mode
that tilts the magnetic field lines, referred to as the `tilting mode'. A weak
shear of the zonal flow excites the critical layer of the tilting mode, which
reverses the tilting direction to form the clamshell pattern and induces the
instability. The asymptotic solution provides insights into properties of the
instability for a range of flow and field profiles. A remarkable feature is
that the magnetic field affects the instability only through its local
behaviour in the critical layer.

paper, we report the surprising finding that round-trip translation can be used

round-trip translation in SMT evaluation unveils that its long-standing
misunderstanding is essentially caused by copying mechanism. After removing
copying mechanism in SMT, round-trip translation scores can appropriately
reflect the forward translation performance. Then, we demonstrate the
rectification is overdue as round-trip translation could benefit multiple

translation could be used i) to predict corresponding forward translation
scores; ii) to improve the performance of the recently advanced quality

on small surface-patches near a given point $x^0$ exhibiting singularities of

which had yet been left open. Denoting by $p_c$ the minimal Lebesgue exponent
such that $\mathcal M_S$ is $L^p$-bounded for $p>p_c,$ we are able to identify
$p_c$ for all analytic surfaces of type $\mathcal A$ (with the exception of a
small subclass), by means of quantities which can be determined from associated
Newton polyhedra. Besides the well-known notion of height at $x^0,$ a new
quantity, which we call the effective multiplicity, turns out to play a crucial
role here. We also state a conjecture on how the critical exponent $p_c$ might
be determined by means of a geometric measure theoretic condition, which
measures in some way the order of contact of arbitrary ellipsoids with $S,$
even for hypersurfaces in arbitrary dimension, and show that this conjecture
holds indeed true for all classes of 2-hypersurfaces $S$ for which we have
gained an essentially complete understanding of $\mathcal M_S$ so far. Our

monitoring under conventional and ultra-high dose rates for small animal
experiments with small-field proton beams using a Faraday cup.
  Methods: We determined a relationship between dose and optical density (OD)
of EBT-XD Gafchromic film using scanned 10x10 cm2 proton pencil beams delivered
at clinical dose rates; the dose was measured with an Advanced Markus chamber.
On a small animal proton irradiation platform, double-scattered pencil beams
with 5 or 8 mm diameter brass collimation at conventional and ultra-high dose
rates were delivered to the EBT-XD films. The proton fluence charges were
collected by a Faraday cup placed downstream from the film. The average of the
irradiated film ODs was related to the Faraday cup charges. A conversion from
the Faraday cup charge to the average dose of the small-field proton beam was
then obtained.
  Results: The relationship between the small-field average profile dose and
Faraday cup charge was established for 10 and 15 Gy mice FLASH experiments. The
film OD was found to be independent of dose rate. At small-animal treatments,
the Faraday cup readings were conveniently used to QA and monitor the delivered
dose and dose rates to the mice under conventional and ultra-high dose rates.
  Conclusion: The dose calibration and monitoring method with Faraday cup for
small animal proton FLASH experiments is time-efficient and cost-effective and
can be used for irradiations of various small field sizes. The same approach
can also be adopted for clinical proton dosimetry for small-field irradiations.

symmetry. In quantum systems there can be obstructions to gauging a global
symmetry. When this happens the symmetry is dubbed anomalous. Such obstructions
are related to the fact that the global symmetry cannot be written as a tensor
product of local operators. In this manuscript we study non-local symmetries
that have an additional structure: they take the form of a matrix product
operator (MPO). We exploit the tensor network structure of the MPOs to
construct local operators from them satisfying the same group relations, that
is, we are able to localize even anomalous MPOs. For non-anomalous MPOs, we use
these local operators to explicitly gauge the MPO symmetry of a one-dimensional
quantum state obtaining non-trivial gauged states. We show that our gauging
procedure satisfies all the desired properties as the standard on-site case
does. We also show how this procedure is naturally represented in matrix
product states protected by MPO symmetries. In the case of anomalous MPOs, we
shed light on the obstructions to gauging these symmetries.

and poorly understood dynamics. For their control issues, the challenge is to
guarantee accuracy, robustness, and generalization in such bloated and troubled
environments. Fortunately, a complex system can be divided into multiple
modular structures that human cognition appears to exploit. Inspired by this
cognition, a novel control method, Causal Coupled Mechanisms (CCMs), is
proposed that explores the cooperation in division and competition in
combination. Our method employs the theory of hierarchical reinforcement
learning (HRL), in which 1) the high-level policy with competitive awareness
divides the whole complex system into multiple functional mechanisms, and 2)
the low-level policy finishes the control task of each mechanism. Specifically
for cooperation, a cascade control module helps the series operation of CCMs,
and a forward coupled reasoning module is used to recover the coupling
information lost in the division process. On both synthetic systems and a
real-world biological regulatory system, the CCM method achieves robust and
state-of-the-art control results even with unpredictable random noise.
Moreover, generalization results show that reusing prepared specialized CCMs
helps to perform well in environments with different confounders and dynamics.

cause interfacial flows driving their own transport and the propulsion of the
droplet. Such non-linear coupling enables active drops to achieve directed
self-propulsion despite their isotropy, if the ratio of advective-to-diffusive
solute transport, i.e. the Peclet number Pe, is larger than a finite critical
threshold. In most experimental situations, active drops are non-neutrally
buoyant and thus swim along rigid surfaces; yet theoretical descriptions of
their non-linear motion focus almost exclusively on unbounded domains to
circumvent geometric complexity. To overcome this gap in understanding, we
investigate the spontaneous emergence and nonlinear saturation of propulsion of
an isotropic phoretic colloid along a rigid wall, to which it is confined by a
constant external force (e.g., gravity). This phoretic particle model is
considered here as a limiting case for a viscous active drop. We show that, for
moderate Pe, the particle motion and associated chemical transport reduce the
chemically-induced wall repulsion, thereby causing the particle to swim
progressively closer to the wall as Pe increases. Far from hindering
self-propulsion, this reduction in the particle-wall separation is accompanied
by a wall-induced efficient rearrangement of the solute concentration gradients
driving the particle, thus augmenting its swimming speed.

talent is a random variable distributed identically for everyone, but wealth is
a random variable that is dependent on the population one is born into.
Individuals then apply to a downstream agent, which we treat as a university
throughout the paper (but could also represent an employer) who makes a
decision about whether to admit them or not. The university does not directly
observe talent or wealth, but rather a signal (representing e.g. a standardized
test) that is a convex combination of both. The university knows the
distributions from which an individual's type and wealth are drawn, and makes
its decisions based on the posterior distribution of the applicant's
characteristics conditional on their population and signal. Each population's
wealth distribution at the next round then depends on the fraction of that
population that was admitted by the university at the previous round.
  We study wealth dynamics in this model, and give conditions under which the
dynamics have a single attracting fixed point (which implies population wealth
inequality is transitory), and conditions under which it can have multiple
attracting fixed points (which implies that population wealth inequality can be
persistent). In the case in which there are multiple attracting fixed points,
we study interventions aimed at eliminating or mitigating inequality, including
increasing the capacity of the university to admit more people, aligning the
signal generated by individuals with the preferences of the university, and
making direct monetary transfers to the less wealthy population.

  Learning via $\epsilon$-Greedy Exploration","Accepted by NeurIPS22",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper provides a theoretical study of deep neural function approximation
in reinforcement learning (RL) with the $\epsilon$-greedy exploration under the
online setting. This problem setting is motivated by the successful deep
Q-networks (DQN) framework that falls in this regime. In this work, we provide
an initial attempt on theoretical understanding deep RL from the perspective of
function class and neural networks architectures (e.g., width and depth) beyond
the ``linear'' regime. To be specific, we focus on the value based algorithm
with the $\epsilon$-greedy exploration via deep (and two-layer) neural networks
endowed by Besov (and Barron) function spaces, respectively, which aims at
approximating an $\alpha$-smooth Q-function in a $d$-dimensional feature space.
We prove that, with $T$ episodes, scaling the width $m =
\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{\frac{d}{2\alpha + d}})$ and the depth
$L=\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ of the neural network for deep RL is sufficient for
learning with sublinear regret in Besov spaces. Moreover, for a two layer
neural network endowed by the Barron space, scaling the width
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ is sufficient. To achieve this, the key issue in our
analysis is how to estimate the temporal difference error under deep neural
function approximation as the $\epsilon$-greedy exploration is not enough to
ensure ``optimism''. Our analysis reformulates the temporal difference error in
an $L^2(\mathrm{d}\mu)$-integrable space over a certain averaged measure $\mu$,
and transforms it to a generalization problem under the non-iid setting. This
might have its own interest in RL theory for better understanding
$\epsilon$-greedy exploration in deep RL.

research and tradition, entangles textural and genetic terms in a less than
consistent fashion, with some taxa (like shergottites) representing varied
lithologies from a single putative parent body while others (like pallasites)
subsume texturally similar objects of multifarious solar system origins. The
familiar concept of group as representative of one primary parent body is also
difficult to define empirically. It is proposed that the classification becomes
explicitly binominal throughout the meteorite spectrum, with classes referring
to petrographically defined primary rock types, whereas groups retain a genetic
meaning, but no longer tied to any assumption on the number of represented
parent bodies. The classification of a meteorite would thus involve both a
class and a group, in a two-dimensional fashion analogous to the way Van Schmus
and Wood decoupled primary and secondary properties in chondrites. Since groups
would not substantially differ, at first, from those in current use de facto,
the taxonomic treatment of normal meteorites, whose class would bring no new
information, would hardly change. Yet classes combined with high- or low-level
groups would provide a standardized grid to characterize petrographically
and/or isotopically unusual or anomalous meteorites (which make up the majority
of represented meteorite parent bodies) for example, in relation to the
carbonaceous/noncarbonaceous dichotomy. In the longer term, the mergers of
genetically related groups, a more systematic treatment of lithology mixtures,
and the chondrite/achondrite transition can further simplify the nomenclature.

preferences and the allocation problem needs to consider complex constraints.
Electricity markets are a prime example, but similar problems appear in many
real-world markets, which has led to a growing literature in market design.
Power markets use heuristic pricing rules based on the dual of a relaxed
allocation problem today. With increasing levels of renewables, these rules
have come under scrutiny as they lead to high out-of-market side-payments to
some participants and to inadequate congestion signals. We show that existing
pricing heuristics optimize specific design goals that can be conflicting. The
trade-offs can be substantial, and we establish that the design of pricing
rules is fundamentally a multi-objective optimization problem addressing
different incentives. In addition to traditional multi-objective optimization
techniques using weighing of individual objectives, we introduce a novel
parameter-free pricing rule that minimizes incentives for market participants
to deviate locally. Our theoretical and experimental findings show how the new
pricing rule capitalizes on the upsides of existing pricing rules under
scrutiny today. It leads to prices that incur low make-whole payments while
providing adequate congestion signals and low lost opportunity costs. Our
suggested pricing rule does not require weighing of objectives, it is
computationally scalable, and balances trade-offs in a principled manner,
addressing an important policy issue in electricity markets.

Behavior Tree (BT) decreases the effort in programming a robot task when
compared to a Finite State Machine (FSM). In recent years the way to represent
a task plan to control an autonomous agent has been shifting from the standard
FSM towards BTs. Many works in the literature have highlighted and proven the
benefits of such design compared to standard approaches, especially in terms of
modularity, reactivity and human readability. However, these works have often
failed in providing a tangible comparison in the implementation of those
policies and the programming effort required to modify them. This is a relevant
aspect in many robotic applications, where the design choice is dictated both
by the robustness of the policy and by the time required to program it. In this
work, we compare backward chained BTs with a fault-tolerant design of FSMs by
evaluating the cost to modify them. We validate the analysis with a set of
experiments in a simulation environment where a mobile manipulator solves an
item fetching task.

robotics. Camera calibration is typically achieved using offline methods that
use checkerboard calibration targets. These methods, however, often are
cumbersome and lengthy, considering that a new calibration is required each
time any camera pose changes. In this work, we propose a novel, marker-free
online method for the extrinsic calibration of multiple smart edge sensors,
relying solely on 2D human keypoint detections that are computed locally on the
sensor boards from RGB camera images. Our method assumes the intrinsic camera
parameters to be known and requires priming with a rough initial estimate of
the camera poses. The person keypoint detections from multiple views are
received at a central backend where they are synchronized, filtered, and
assigned to person hypotheses. We use these person hypotheses to repeatedly
solve optimization problems in the form of factor graphs. Given suitable
observations of one or multiple persons traversing the scene, the estimated
camera poses converge towards a coherent extrinsic calibration within a few
minutes. We evaluate our approach in real-world settings and show that the
calibration with our method achieves lower reprojection errors compared to a
reference calibration generated by an offline method using a traditional
calibration target.

from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RCTs estimate the average effect of
one treatment versus another in a certain population. However, treatments may
not be equally effective for every patient in a population. Knowing the
effectiveness of treatments tailored to specific patient and tumor
characteristics would enable individualized treatment decisions. Getting
tailored treatment effects by averaging outcomes in different patient subgroups
in RCTs requires an unfeasible number of patients to have sufficient
statistical power in all relevant subgroups for all possible treatments.
  The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) recommends that researchers
develop outcome prediction models (OPMs) in an effort to individualize
treatment decisions. OPMs sometimes called risk models or prognosis models, use
patient and tumor characteristics to predict a patient outcome such as overall
survival. The assumption is that the predictions are useful for treatment
decisions using rules such as ""prescribe chemotherapy only if the OPM predicts
the patient has a high risk of recurrence"". Recognizing the importance of
reliable predictions, the AJCC published a checklist for OPMs to ensure
dependable OPM prediction accuracy in the patient population for which the OPM
was designed. However, accurate outcome predictions do not imply that these
predictions yield good treatment decisions. In this perspective, we show that
OPM rely on a fixed treatment policy which implies that OPM that were found to
accurately predict outcomes in validation studies can still lead to patient
harm when used to inform treatment decisions. We then give guidance on how to
develop models that are useful for individualized treatment decisions and how
to evaluate whether a model has value for decision-making.

problems: the mismatch between the number of filters at the front end of the
detector and the spectral reconstruction accuracy; the lack of a stable
spectral reconstruction algorithm; and the lack of a spectral reconstruction
evaluation method suitable for engineering. Therefore, based on 20 sets of
filters, this paper classifies and optimizes the filter array by the K-means
algorithm and particle swarm algorithm, and obtains the optimal filter
combination under different matrix dimensions. Then, the truncated singular
value decomposition-convex optimization algorithm is used for high-precision
spectral reconstruction, and the detailed spectral reconstruction process of
two typical target spectra is described. In terms of spectral evaluation, due
to the strong randomness of the target detected during the working process of
the spectrometer, the standard value of the target spectrum cannot be obtained.
Therefore, for the first time, we adopt the method of joint cross-validation of
multiple sets of data for spectral evaluation. The results show that when the
random error of positive or negative 2 code values is applied multiple times
for reconstruction, the spectral angle cosine value between the reconstructed
curves becomes more than 0.995, which proves that the spectral reconstruction
under this algorithm has high stability. At the same time, the spectral angle
cosine value of the spectral reconstruction curve and the standard curve can
reach above 0.99, meaning that it realizes a high-precision spectral
reconstruction effect. A high-precision spectral reconstruction algorithm based
on truncated singular value-convex optimization, which is suitable for
engineering applications, is established in this paper, providing important
scientific research value for the engineering application of
micro-spectrometers.

Using experiments, we then test whether these implications are borne out by the

resulting prices can be far from competitive equilibria. We also show that the
effectiveness of our counterexamples is blunted when traders can leave without

adjust the attack strength and difficulties of each class to generate samples

target-class fairness, by introducing a uniform distribution constraint, we
encourage the adversarial example generation process for each class with a fair

best to ensure user experience during app development and maintenance to
improve the rating of their apps on app platforms and attract more user
downloads. Previous studies indicated that responding to users' reviews tends

replied are more likely to update the given ratings. However, reading and
responding to every user review is not an easy task for developers since it is

tools for review replying are needed.
  To address the need above, the paper introduces a Transformer-based approach,

extracts apps' categories, rating, and review text as the input features. By
adapting a Transformer-based model, TRRGen can generate appropriate replies for

in learning contextual representation for tabular data. The learning of an
effective contextual representation requires meaningful features and a large
amount of data. However, current methods often fail to properly learn a
contextual representation from the features without semantic information. In
addition, it's intractable to enlarge the training set through mixed tabular
datasets due to the difference between datasets. To address these problems, we
propose a novel framework PTab, using the Pre-trained language model to model
Tabular data. PTab learns a contextual representation of tabular data through a
three-stage processing: Modality Transformation(MT), Masked-Language
Fine-tuning(MF), and Classification Fine-tuning(CF). We initialize our model
with a pre-trained Model (PTM) which contains semantic information learned from
the large-scale language data. Consequently, contextual representation can be
learned effectively during the fine-tuning stages. In addition, we can
naturally mix the textualized tabular data to enlarge the training set to
further improve representation learning. We evaluate PTab on eight popular
tabular classification datasets. Experimental results show that our method has
achieved a better average AUC score in supervised settings compared to the
state-of-the-art baselines(e.g. XGBoost), and outperforms counterpart methods

a giant overreflection where the reflectance is much larger than 10 in a fairly
broad range of the incident angles, the frequency, and the plasma $\beta$ and
its maximum attains values larger than $10^5$. In a finite $\beta$ plasma, both
incident fast and slow magnetosonic waves are found to cause strong
overreflection and there appear multiple positions exhibiting both Alfv\'en and
slow resonances inside the plasma. We explain the mechanism of overreflection
in terms of the formation of inhomogeneous and open cavities close to the
resonances and the strong enhancement of the wave energy due to the occurrence
of semi-bound states there. We give discussions of the observational
consequences in magnetized terrestrial and solar plasmas.

the present literature, in the context of possible presence of DM in SQSs, this
work is the first to consider interaction between DM and SQM in the DM admixed

($m_{\xi}$) and the coupling ($y_{\xi}$) between them are determined in
accordance with the constraint from Bullet cluster and the present day relic

the lower the values of maximum mass and radius of the DM admixed SQSs. For the
chosen values of $m_{\chi}$ and corresponding values of $m_{\xi}$ and
$y_{\xi}$, the computed structural properties of the DM admixed SQSs satisfy

these subgraph matching methods do not work. We propose a method for

The law manipulation experiments illustrate CLAP's interpretability by
modifying specific latent random functions on samples. For example, CLAP learns
the laws of position-changing and appearance constancy from the moving balls in
a scene, making it possible to exchange laws between samples or compose

to conventional learning frameworks such as backpropagation. The effectiveness
of EP stems from the fact that it relies only on local computations and

phases, thereby enabling greater applicability in domains such as bio-inspired
neuromorphic computing. The dynamics of the model in EP is governed by an
energy function and the internal states of the model consequently converge to a

by definition, EP requires the input to the model (a convergent RNN) to be
static in both the phases of training. Thus it is not possible to design a
model for sequence classification using EP with an LSTM or GRU like

networks to further understand energy based models and develop solutions for
complex sequence classification tasks using EP while satisfying its convergence

group $2 \cdot A_4$ as a subalgebra of the Quaternion over integers and
half-integers called Hurwitz quaternionic integers $\mathscr{H}$ in the book by
J.H.Conway and Neil J. A. Sloane. In this paper, I have followed this book and
extended Quaternion over integers and half-integers to have duality, and proved
that a subalgebra in it isomorphic to Exceptional Weyl group $W(F_4)$. I have
also found a method of constructing the $16$-dimensional lattice $\Lambda_{16}$
which seems to be isomorphic to the lattice called the Barnes-Wall lattice
$\Lambda_{\text {Barnes-Wall }}$, which is currently considered to be very
dense (although this remains to be discussed) using the Dual Quaternion.
Lastly, I briefly mention how to construct an exceptional Weyl group $W(E_8)$
using an Octonion and Dual Quaternion.

fields due to its intriguing spiral architecture and unique sensing
characteristics. One of its most interesting features is the ability to sense
acoustic waves at different spatial locations, based on their frequency
content. In this work, we propose a novel design for a tonotopic resonator,
based on a cochlea-inspired spiral. The resulting structure was subjected to an
optimization process to exhibit out-of-plane vibration modes with mean
out-of-plane displacement maxima distributed along its centerline spanning
nearly a two-decade frequency range. Numerical simulations are performed to
demonstrate the concept, which is also confirmed experimentally on a 3D printed
structure. The obtained frequency-dependent distribution is shown to be a
viable source of information for the discrimination of signals with various
frequency components. The harnessed tonotopic features can be used as a
fundamental principle to design structures with applications in areas such as
non-destructive testing and vibration attenuation.

  from Pre-trained Language Models","COLING 2022",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Constituency Parse Extraction from Pre-trained Language Models (CPE-PLM) is a
recent paradigm that attempts to induce constituency parse trees relying only
on the internal knowledge of pre-trained language models. While attractive in
the perspective that similar to in-context learning, it does not require
task-specific fine-tuning, the practical effectiveness of such an approach
still remains unclear, except that it can function as a probe for investigating
language models' inner workings. In this work, we mathematically reformulate
CPE-PLM and propose two advanced ensemble methods tailored for it,
demonstrating that the new parsing paradigm can be competitive with common
unsupervised parsers by introducing a set of heterogeneous PLMs combined using
our techniques. Furthermore, we explore some scenarios where the trees
generated by CPE-PLM are practically useful. Specifically, we show that CPE-PLM
is more effective than typical supervised parsers in few-shot settings.

  with Youth",,,,,"cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The ability to regulate and cope with strong emotions is essential for
maintaining our mental health and well-being. However, learning how to
emotionally regulate can be a bit of a mystery since it is largely an invisible
process and it can be difficult to conjure up strong emotions to practice
regulating them. This is where virtual reality (or VR) comes in. VR is a
computer-generated 3D environment where the user experiences a simulated world
through 360 visuals, stereo audio, and 3D interaction with tracking sensors. VR
is a very visceral experience that feels 'real' even though you know it isn't.
If a virtual ball came flying at your head, you would duck! My past research
shows that we can provide VR experiences that elicit strong emotional reactions
so that people can practice coping and regulating their emotional responses.
For example, I helped create a VR experience of being in nature and then going
into space to see the Earth; it created the emotional reaction of awe and
wonder that led to a deeper connection with our planet. This shows that
emotional VR experiences can impact our emotions and behaviour both in VR and
beyond. My research proposal is to investigate the feasibility of emotion
regulation skills development in VR with teenagers. The idea is to simulate
emotional experiences (like the 1st day of high school) as a means to develop
emotion regulation skills so that they will be able to better cope with their
emotions. I will lead the design, development, and evaluation of this VR
experience and work directly with youth to meet their needs. This proof of
concept prototype is the first step in developing a VR platform that provides
youth with an effective way to regulate their emotions and improve their mental
health from their own homes, which will lead to improvements in education,
socio-emotional, and economic outcomes for youth in Canada and globally.

knowledge and it shows the benefit of offering complementary features across
different modalities. Recent work mainly focuses on the modalities such as
image and text, for example, studies show that visual features learned from
images can help visual-grounded language understanding. In this paper, we
consider investigating the potential connection between offline reinforcement
learning (RL) and language modeling (LM). Intuitively, RL and LM are similar in
predicting the next states based on the current and previous states, which rely
on both local and long-range dependency across states. To validate such an
assumption, we pre-trained different offline RL tasks using Transformer and
then evaluate these models on various language-related tasks. Experimental
results show that our RL pre-trained models can give close performance compared
with the models using the LM training objective, showing that there exist
common useful features across these two modalities. To further explore the
potential relationship, we investigate some factors such as Markov property and
the sequential nature of RL trajectory.

  (HEVC) using Relational Databases for Multi-objective Optimization",,,,,"cs.NI cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Our current technological era is flooded with smart devices that provide
significant computational resources that require optimal video communications
solutions. Optimal and dynamic management of video bitrate, quality and energy
demands needs to take into account their inter-dependencies. With emerging
network generations providing higher bandwidth rates, there is also a growing
need to communicate video with the best quality subject to the availability of
resources such as computational power and available bandwidth. Similarly, for
accommodating multiple users, there is a need to minimize bitrate requirements
while sustaining video quality for reasonable encoding times.
  This thesis focuses on providing an efficient mechanism for deriving optimal
solutions for HEVC codec based on switching GOP configurations. The approach
provides a basic system for multi-objective optimization with constraints on
power, video quality, bitrate. This is accomplished by utilizing a recently
introduced framework known as Dynamically Reconfigurable Architectures for
Time-varying Image Constraints (DRASTIC) in HEVC/H.265 codec with six different
GOP configurations to support optimization modes for minimum bitrate, maximum
quality and minimum computational time (minimum energy in constant power
configuration) mode of operation. Pareto-Optimal GOP configs are used in
implementing these DRASTIC modes.
