language for quantum computing, which is especially powerful for the framework

this thesis, we give the first complete axiomatisation the ZX-calculus for the
overall pure qubit quantum mechanics, via a translation from the completeness
result of another graphical language for quantum computing -- the ZW-calculus.
This paves the way for automated pictorial quantum computing, with the aid of
some software like Quantomatic. Based on this universal completeness, we
directly obtain a complete axiomatisation of the ZX-calculus for the Clifford+T
quantum mechanics, which is approximatively universal for quantum computing, by
restricting the ring of complex numbers to its subring corresponding to the
Clifford+T fragment resting on the completeness theorem of the ZW-calculus for
arbitrary commutative ring. Furthermore, we prove the completeness of the
ZX-calculus (with just 9 rules) for 2-qubit Clifford+T circuits by verifying
the complete set of 17 circuit relations in diagrammatic rewriting. In addition
to completeness results within the qubit related formalism, we extend the
completeness of the ZX-calculus for qubit stabilizer quantum mechanics to the
qutrit stabilizer system. Finally, we show with some examples the application
of the ZX-calculus to the proof of generalised supplementarity, the
representation of entanglement classification and Toffoli gate, as well as
equivalence-checking for the UMA gate.

by proposing a novel method built on top of a reinforcement learning agent.
Starting from a pre-trained agent using numerous actuators, the algorithm
estimates the impact of a potential actuator removal on the value function,
indicating the agent's performance. It is applied to two test cases, the
one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and a laminar bi-dimensional flow
around an airfoil at Re=1000 for different angles of attack ranging from 12 to
20 degrees, to demonstrate its capabilities and limits. The proposed
actuator-sparsification method relies on a sequential elimination of the least
relevant action components, starting from a fully developed layout. The
relevancy of each component is evaluated using metrics based on the value
function. Results show that, while still being limited by this intrinsic
elimination paradigm (i.e. the sequential elimination), actuator patterns and
obtained policies demonstrate relevant performances and allow to draw an
accurate approximation of the Pareto front of performances versus actuator
budget.

predictions when exploring the characteristics of dust formed in the ejecta of
core-collapse supernovae. We revisit the scenario of dust production in typical
supernova ejecta in the first 3000 days after explosion, with an improved
understanding of the evolving physical conditions and the distribution of the
clumps. The generic, nonuniform distribution of dust within the ejecta was
determined and using that, the relevant opacities and fluxes were calculated.
The dependence of the emerging fluxes on the viewing angle was estimated for an
anisotropic, ellipsoidal geometry of the ejecta that imitate SN 1987A. We model
the He-core from the center to its outer edge as 450 stratified, clumpy,
annular shells, uniquely identified by their distinct velocities and
characterized by their variations in abundances, densities, and gas and dust
temperatures. We find that the formation of dust starts between day 450 and day
550 post-explosion, and it continues until about day 2800, although the first
1600 days are the most productive. The total dust mass evolves from about 10^-5
Msun at day 500 to 10^-3 Msun at day 800, finally saturating at about 0.06
Msun. The masses of the O-rich dust (silicates, alumina) dominates the C-rich
dust (amorphous carbon, silicon carbide) at all times; the formation of carbon
dust is delayed beyond 2000 days post-explosion. We show that the opacities are
largest between days 800 and 1600, and the characteristic spectral features of
O-rich dust species are suppressed at those times. The fluxes emerging along
the smallest axes of the ellipsoidal ejecta are found to be the most obscured,
while a viewing angle between 16 and 21 degrees with that axis appears to be in
the best agreement with the fluxes from SN 1987A at days 615 and 775.

quantum evolutions. It is the very notion of complete positivity which provides
a proper mathematical representation of quantum evolution and gives rise to the
powerful generalization of unitary evolution of closed Hamiltonian systems. A
prominent example of quantum evolution of an open system is a Markovian
semigroup. In what follows, we analyze both the semigroups of positive and
completely positive maps. In the latter case the dynamics is governed by the
celebrated Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan (GKLS) Master Equation.
Markovian semigroups, however, provide only an approximate description of
general quantum evolution. The main topic of our analysis are dynamical maps
beyond this regime. Non-Markovian quantum evolution attracted a lot of
attention in recent years and there is a vast literature dedicated to it. In
this report we analyze quantum dynamics governed by time-local generators
and/or non-local memory kernels. A special attention is devoted to the concept
of {\em divisibility} which is often used as a definition of Markovianity. In
particular, the concept of so called CP-divisibility (in contrast to
P-divisibility) is widely accepted as a proper definition of quantum
Markovianity. We discuss a number of important physical implications of
divisibility. We also briefly discuss the notion of Markovianity beyond the
dynamical map, that is, when one has an access to the evolution of `system +
environment'. The entire exposition is concentrated more on the general
concepts and intricate connections between them than on studying particular
systems. We illustrate the analyzed concepts by paradigmatic models of open
quantum systems like the amplitude damping and phase damping models.

The measurement is performed selecting $t\bar{t}$ events decaying into final

$b$-tagged jets. The polarisation is extracted from the differential
cross-section distribution of the $\cos{\theta^{*}}$ variable, where
$\theta^{*}$ is the angle between the momentum direction of the charged lepton

from the top-quark decay, both calculated in the $W$ boson rest frame.

the change in the height of the potential $\Delta V$ to the change in the

therefore measures the requisite degree of flatness in the potential. The best
motivated warm inflationary scenarios involve a dissipation rate of the kind
$\Gamma\propto T^c$ with $c\geq 0$, and for all such cases, the bounds on
$\lambda$ are tighter than those for standard cold inflation by at least 3
orders of magnitude. In other words, these models require an even flatter
potential than standard inflation. On the other hand for the case of warm
inflation with $c< 0$, we find that in a strongly dissipative regime the bound
on $\lambda$ can significantly weaken with respect to cold inflation. Thus, if
a warm inflation model can be constructed in a strongly dissipative, negatively
temperature-dependent regime, it accommodates steeper potentials otherwise

concept, which is presently being studied on the Z Pulsed Power Facility. The
MagLIF platform has achieved interesting plasma conditions at stagnation and
produced significant fusion yields in the laboratory. Given the relative
success of MagLIF, there is a strong interest to scale the platform to higher
peak currents. However, scaling MagLIF is not entirely straightforward due to
the large dimensionality of the experimental input parameter space and the
large number of distinct physical processes involved in MIF implosions. In this
work, we propose a novel method to scale MagLIF loads to higher currents. Our
method is based on similarity (or similitude) scaling and attempts to preserve
much of the physics regimes already known or being studied on today's Z
pulsed-power driver. By avoiding significant deviations into unexplored and/or
less well-understood regimes, the risk of unexpected outcomes on future
scaled-up experiments is reduced. Using arguments based on similarity scaling,
we derive the scaling rules for the experimental input parameters
characterizing a MagLIF load (as functions of the characteristic current
driving the implosion). We then test the estimated scaling laws for various
metrics measuring performance against results of 2D
radiation--magneto-hydrodynamic HYDRA simulations. Agreement is found between
the scaling theory and the simulation results.

magneto-inertial-fusion (MIF) concept studied on the Z Machine at Sandia
National Laboratories. Two important metrics characterizing current delivery to
a z-pinch load are the peak current and the current-rise time, which is roughly
the time interval to reach peak current. It is known that, when driving a
z-pinch load with a longer current-rise time, the performance of the z-pinch
decreases. However, a theory to understand and quantify this effect is still
lacking. In this paper, we utilize a framework based on similarity scaling to
analytically investigate the variations in performance of MagLIF loads when
varying the current-rise time, or equivalently, the implosion timescale. To
maintain similarity between the implosions, we provide the scaling
prescriptions of the experimental input parameters defining a MagLIF load and
derive the scaling laws for the stagnation conditions and for various
performance metrics. We compare predictions of the theory to 2D numerical
simulations using the radiation, magneto-hydrodynamic code HYDRA. For several
metrics, we find acceptable agreement between the theory and simulations. Our
results show that the voltage near the MagLIF load follows a weak scaling law
$\smash{\varphi_{\rm load} \propto t_\varphi^{-0.12}}$ with respect to the
characteristic timescale $t_\varphi$ of the voltage source, instead of the
ideal $\smash{\varphi_{\rm load} \propto t_\varphi^{-1}}$ scaling. This occurs
because the imploding height of the MagLIF load must increase to preserve end
losses. As a consequence of the longer imploding liners, the required total
laser preheat energy and delivered electric energy increase. Overall, this
study may help understand the trade-offs of the MagLIF design space when
considering future pulsed-power generators with shorter and longer current-rise
times.

generative capabilities in other domains, are promising candidates for human
motion due to their many-to-many nature, but they tend to be resource hungry

a carefully adapted classifier-free diffusion-based generative model for the

generation literature. A notable design-choice is the prediction of the sample,

established geometric losses on the locations and velocities of the motion,
such as the foot contact loss. As we demonstrate, MDM is a generic approach,

dipole. Einstein equations in our ""dipole cosmology"" are still ordinary

have four. The two new functions can be viewed as an anisotropic scale factor
that breaks the isotropy group from $SO(3)$ to $U(1)$, and a ""tilt"" that
captures the cosmic flow velocity. The result is an axially isotropic, tilted
Bianchi V/VII$_h$ cosmology. We assess the possibility of model building within
the dipole cosmology paradigm, and discuss the dynamics of expansion rate,
anisotropic shear and tilt, in various examples. A key observation is that the
cosmic flow (tilt) can grow even while the anisotropy (shear) dies down.
Remarkably, this can happen even in an era of late time acceleration.

networks (GNNs) have been studied extensively and have successfully performed
difficult machine learning tasks in node classification, link prediction, and
graph classification thanks to the highly expressive capability via message

anomaly detection problem, GNN-based methods leverage information about the
graph attributes (or features) and/or structures to learn to score anomalies
appropriately. In this survey, we review the recent advances made in detecting
graph anomalies using GNN models. Specifically, we summarize GNN-based methods
according to the graph type (i.e., static and dynamic), the anomaly type (i.e.,
node, edge, subgraph, and whole graph), and the network architecture (e.g.,
graph autoencoder, graph convolutional network). To the best of our knowledge,
this survey is the first comprehensive review of graph anomaly detection
methods based on GNNs.

the invariance principle. In particular, we use contrastive unsupervised
learning to learn the invariant causal features, which enforces invariance
across augmentations of irrelevant parts or styles of the observation. The
world-model-based reinforcement learning methods independently optimize
representation learning and the policy. Thus naive contrastive loss
implementation collapses due to a lack of supervisory signals to the
representation learning module. We propose an intervention invariant auxiliary
task to mitigate this issue. Specifically, we utilize depth prediction to
explicitly enforce the invariance and use data augmentation as style
intervention on the RGB observation space. Our design leverages unsupervised
representation learning to learn the world model with invariant causal
features. Our proposed method significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods on
out-of-distribution point navigation tasks on the iGibson dataset. Moreover,
our proposed model excels at the sim-to-real transfer of our perception

  flow: transport of mass and momentum",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The numerical modelling of convection dominated high density ratio two-phase
flow poses several challenges, amongst which is resolving the relatively thin
shear layer at the interface. To this end we propose a sharp discretisation of
the two-velocity model of the two-phase Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. This
results in the ability to model the shear layer, rather than resolving it, by
allowing for a velocity discontinuity in the direction(s) tangential to the
interface.
  In this paper we focus our attention on the transport of mass and momentum in
the presence of such a velocity discontinuity. We propose a generalisation of
the dimensionally unsplit geometric volume of fluid (VOF) method for the
advection of the interface in the two-velocity formulation. Sufficient
conditions on the construction of donating regions are derived that ensure
boundedness of the volume fraction for dimensionally unsplit advection methods.
We propose to interpolate the mass fluxes resulting from the dimensionally
unsplit geometric VOF method for the advection of the staggered momentum field,
resulting in semi-discrete energy conservation. Division of the momentum by the
respective mass, to obtain the velocity, is not always well-defined for nearly
empty control volumes and therefore care is taken in the construction of the
momentum flux interpolant: our proposed flux interpolant guarantees that this
division is always well-defined without being unnecessarily dissipative.
  Besides the newly proposed two-velocity model we also detail our exactly
conservative (mass per phase and total linear momentum) implementation of the
one-velocity formulation of the two-phase NS equations, which will be used for
comparison.
  The discretisation methods are validated using classical time-reversible flow
fields, where in this paper the advection is uncoupled from the NS solver,
which will be developed in a later paper.

instructions in an environment. Current RL agents can solve families of related
tasks at best, or require planning anew for each task. Strategies for
approximate zero-shot RL ave been suggested using successor features (SFs)
[BBQ+ 18] or forward-backward (FB) representations [TO21], but testing has been
limited.

improved losses and new SF models, and test the viability of zero-shot RL

disentangle universal representation learning from exploration, we work in an

non-thermal velocity dispersion of two prestellar cores and their surrounding
clouds are smaller than or comparable to the sound speed. This may indicate
that the turbulence has already been dissipated for both filaments and cores
during their formation time. We also found a $\lambda/4$ shift between the
periodic oscillations in the velocity and the column density distributions
implying the possible presence of gravitational core-forming flow motion along
the axis of the filament. The mass accretion rates due to these flow motions
are estimated to be 2-3 M$_\odot$ Myr$^{-1}$, being comparable to that for
Serpens cloud but much smaller than those for the Hub filaments, cluster, or
high mass forming filaments by 1 or 2 order of magnitudes. From this study, we
suggest that the filaments in our targets might be formed from the
shock-compression of colliding clouds, and then the cores are formed by
gravitational fragmentation of the filaments to evolve to the prestellar stage.
We conclude that the filamentary structures in the clouds play an important
role in the entire process of formation of dense cores and their evolution.

expel mass through feedback processes. However, it is not well understood how
the radiation fields prevalent during the epoch of reionization affect the
evolution of concentration in dark matter halos. We investigate how baryonic
physics during the epoch of reionization modify the structure of dark matter
halos in the Cosmic Reionization On Computers (CROC) simulations. We use two
different measures of halo concentration to quantify the effects. We compare
concentrations of halos matched between full physics simulations and
dark-matter-only simulations with identical initial conditions between $5 \leq
z \leq 9$. Baryons in full physics simulations do pull matter towards the
center, increasing the maximum circular velocity compared to dark-matter-only
simulations. However, their overall effects are much less than if all the
baryons were simply centrally concentrated indicating that heating processes
efficiently counteract cooling effects. Finally, we show that the baryonic
effects on halo concentrations at $z\approx5$ are relatively insensitive to
environmental variations of reionization history. These results are pertinent
to models of galaxy-halo connection during the epoch of reionization.

be implemented distributively over the network of systems. In this paper, the
decentralized receding horizon control problem for very large-scale networks of
dynamically decoupled systems with a common, possibly time-varying, control
objective is addressed. Each system is assumed to be modeled by linear
time-varying dynamics, which can be leveraged to approximate nonlinear systems
about successive points of operation. A distributed and decentralized receding
horizon control solution is put forward, which: i) takes communication delays
into account; ii) allows local communication exclusively; and iii) whose
computational and memory requirements in each computational unit do not scale
with the dimension of the network. The scalability of the proposed solution
enables emerging very large-scale applications of swarm robotics and networked
control. It is applied herein to the orbit control problem of LEO
mega-constellations featuring high-fidelity numerical simulations for the

accesses cache. To date, practical attacks on cryptosystems and media libraries
are demonstrated under different scenarios, inferring secret keys and
reconstructing private media data such as images.
  This work first presents eight criteria for designing a full-fledged detector
for cache side-channel vulnerabilities. Then, we propose CacheQL, a novel
detector that meets all of these criteria. CacheQL precisely quantifies
information leaks of binary code, by characterizing the distinguishability of
logged side channel traces. Moreover, CacheQL models leakage as a cooperative
game, allowing information leakage to be precisely distributed to program
points vulnerable to cache side channels. CacheQL is meticulously optimized to
analyze whole side channel traces logged from production software (where each
trace can have millions of records), and it alleviates randomness introduced by
cryptographic blinding, ORAM, or real-world noises.
  Our evaluation quantifies side-channel leaks of production cryptographic and
media software. We further localize vulnerabilities reported by previous
detectors and also identify a few hundred new leakage sites in recent OpenSSL
(ver. 3.0.0), MbedTLS (ver. 3.0.0), Libgcrypt (ver. 1.9.4). Many of our
localized program points are within the pre-processing modules of

also localize vulnerabilities in Libjpeg (ver. 2.1.2) that leak privacy about

(MR) policies for finite-state-action, infinite-horizon, constrained
risk-sensitive Markov decision processes (CRSMDPs). Constraints are in the form
of standard expected discounted cost functions as well as expected
risk-sensitive discounted cost functions over finite and infinite horizons. The
main contribution is to show that the problem possesses a solution if it is
feasible, and to provide two methods for finding an approximate solution in the
form of an ultimately stationary (US) MR policy. The latter is achieved through
two approximating finite-horizon CRSMDPs which are constructed from the
original CRSMDP by time-truncating the original objective and constraint cost
functions, and suitably perturbing the constraint upper bounds. The first
approximation gives a US policy which is $\epsilon$-optimal and feasible for
the original problem, while the second approximation gives a near-optimal US
policy whose violation of the original constraints is bounded above by a
specified $\epsilon$. A key step in the proofs is an appropriate choice of a
metric that makes the set of infinite-horizon MR policies and the feasible
regions of the three CRSMDPs compact, and the objective and constraint
functions continuous. A linear-programming-based formulation for solving the
approximating finite-horizon CRSMDPs is also given.

using the circuit QED paradigm, by galvanically coupling a highly nonlinear
fluxonium qubit to a tight-binding lattice of microwave resonators. In this
regime, the transport of a single photon is strongly modified by the presence
of multi-photon bound states, owing to interactions that break particle number
conservation. Exploiting the effective photon-photon interactions mediated by
the qubit, the driven system can be configured as a continuous reservoir of
strongly-correlated photons, a resource of interest for quantum networks. This
work opens exciting prospects for exploring nonlinear quantum optics at the
single-photon level and stabilizing entangled many-body phases of light.

the safety of autonomous systems. However, the provided safety assurances are
often predicated on the assumption that once deployed, the system or its
environment does not evolve. Online, however, an autonomous system might
experience changes in system dynamics, control authority, external
disturbances, and/or the surrounding environment, requiring updated safety
assurances. Rather than restarting the safety analysis from scratch, which can
be time-consuming and often intractable to perform online, we propose to
compute \textit{parameter-conditioned} reachable sets. Assuming expected system
and environment changes can be parameterized, we treat these parameters as
virtual states in the system and leverage recent advances in high-dimensional
reachability analysis to solve the corresponding reachability problem offline.
This results in a family of reachable sets that is parameterized by the
environment and system factors. Online, as these factors change, the system can
simply query the corresponding safety function from this family to ensure
system safety, enabling a real-time update of the safety assurances. Through
various simulation studies, we demonstrate the capability of our approach in
maintaining system safety despite the system and environment evolution.

introduced by Borkar [V. S. Borkar, A topology for Markov controls, Applied

revised to include time also as a parameter. We then establish that finite

up to an exit time, and ergodic cost optimal control problems in

present a unified and concise approach for approximations directly applicable

existence of random phenomena/experiments in which the events cannot generally

\textit{typicalistic} (instead of probabilistic) experiments. As probabilistic
experiments are represented by probability spaces, typicalistic experiments can
be represented by \textit{typicality spaces}, where a typicality space is
basically a probability space in which the probability measure has been
replaced by a much less structured typicality measure $T$. The condition $T(A)
\approx 1$ defines the typical sets, and a typicality space is related to a
typicalistic experiment by associating the typical sets of the former with the
nearly certain events of the latter. Some elements of a theory of typicality,
including the definition of typicality spaces, are developed in the first part
of the paper. The second hypothesis is that the evolution of a quantum particle

phenomenon, so that it can be represented by the combination of typicality
theory and quantum mechanics. The result is a novel formulation of quantum
mechanics that does not present the measurement problem and that could be a
viable alternative to Bohmian mechanics. This subject is developed in the

about the true underlying state of the system -- is ubiquitous in real-world
applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Theoretically, learning a
near-optimal policy under partial observability is known to be hard in the
worst case due to an exponential sample complexity lower bound. Recent work has
identified several tractable subclasses that are learnable with polynomial
samples, such as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with
certain revealing or decodability conditions. However, this line of research is
still in its infancy, where (1) unified structural conditions enabling
sample-efficient learning are lacking; (2) existing sample complexities for
known tractable subclasses are far from sharp; and (3) fewer sample-efficient
algorithms are available than in fully observable RL.
  This paper advances all three aspects above for Partially Observable RL in
the general setting of Predictive State Representations (PSRs). First, we
propose a natural and unified structural condition for PSRs called
\emph{B-stability}. B-stable PSRs encompasses the vast majority of known
tractable subclasses such as weakly revealing POMDPs, low-rank
future-sufficient POMDPs, decodable POMDPs, and regular PSRs. Next, we show
that any B-stable PSR can be learned with polynomial samples in relevant
problem parameters. When instantiated in the aforementioned subclasses, our
sample complexities improve substantially over the current best ones. Finally,
our results are achieved by three algorithms simultaneously: Optimistic Maximum
Likelihood Estimation, Estimation-to-Decisions, and Model-Based Optimistic
Posterior Sampling. The latter two algorithms are new for sample-efficient
learning of POMDPs/PSRs.

terms of total variation (TV) distance and lacks non-asymptotic bounds on the
rate of convergence that are readily computable in applications. Likewise, the
Laplace approximation is not equipped with non-asymptotic quality guarantees
for the vast classes of posteriors for which it is asymptotically valid. To
understand its quality and real-problem applicability, we need finite-sample
bounds that can be computed for a given model and data set. And to understand
the quality of posterior mean and variance estimates, we need bounds on
divergences alternative to the TV distance. Our work provides the first
closed-form, finite-sample bounds for the quality of the Laplace approximation
that do not require log concavity of the posterior or an exponential-family
likelihood. We bound not only the TV distance but also (A) the Wasserstein-1
distance, which controls error in a posterior mean estimate, and (B) an
integral probability metric that controls the error in a posterior variance
estimate. We compute exact constants in our bounds for a variety of standard

implementation in standard applications and devices. When downscaling bulk
materials into their two-dimensional (2D) magnetic isotropic form, the
Mermin-Wagner theorem precludes this collective state mediated by short-range
exchange interactions at finite temperatures. Interestingly, this prediction
fails when significant magnetic anisotropy is present in the material, as
recently demonstrated in single layered van der Waals crystals. Before the
latter, single layer metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) grown on metallic supports
were one of the earliest candidates for achieving 2D-FM. Such high expectations
were based on the chemical and spacing control of the 2D-MOF magnetic centers,
the tunability of the organic linkers and the rich self-assembled architectures
displayed. However, despite many attempts, extended FM in 2D-MOFs has been
experimentally elusive. In this work, we demonstrate that extended, cooperative
FM takes place in an atom thick 2D-MOF consisting of 9,10-dicyanoanthracene
(DCA) molecules and Fe adatoms grown on Au(111). We show this by means of an
experimental multitechnique approach that is endorsed by state-of-the art
first-principles calculations. Particularly, this 2D ferromagnet follows a
first order transition with TC ~ 35 K, which is driven by exchange interactions
mainly through the molecular linkers (J=2 meV) and exhibits an out-of-plane
square-like hysteresis loop. The strict periodicity of our 2D-MOF allows us to
envision the fabrication of ultra-dense single atom magnetic memories and opens
the way to explore periodic magnetic 2D-models that could considerably increase
the fundamental superparamagnetic limit.

non-segmental approach to detect multiple change-points by concentrating the
abrupt changes into a global distributional parameter, which is characterized
by a function of states of the system. We construct a class of discrete spike
and Cauchy-slab variate prior, which distinguishes from existing such two-group
mixture priors by a dynamic rate of a latent indicator. A 3-sigma
discrimination criterion of change-points is built with sigma being the
standard deviation of the sequence of differences between marginal maximum a
posteriori estimates on two adjacent discretized states. It intrinsically
guarantees reasonable false positive rate to prevent over-detection. The
proposed method is powerful and robust to unveil structure changes of the
autoregression model for house prices in London and the linear regression model
for age-specific fertility in US, not to mention consistent detection results
of shifts of mean or scale on known data sets. Abundant simulations demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art others in finite-sample

This rich class includes not only a majority of known tractable model-based
Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems (such as tabular MDPs, factored MDPs, low

multi-step decodable POMDPs), but also many new challenging RL problems
especially in the partially observable setting that were not previously known
to be tractable.
  Notably, the new problems addressed by this paper include (1) observable
POMDPs with continuous observation and function approximation, where we achieve
the first sample complexity that is completely independent of the size of
observation space; (2) well-conditioned low-rank sequential decision making
problems (also known as Predictive State Representations (PSRs)), which include

Bellman/witness rank to address partial observability. This paper also presents

there have been a few attempts to adapt V&L models trained with contrastive

the very first method that sets outs to accomplish this goal for a generative

REST, a training framework consisting of two key components: an unsupervised
method for adapting the generative model to action/video by means of
pseudo-caption generation and Self-training, i.e. without using any
action-specific labels; (b) a Retrieval approach based on CLIP for discovering
a diverse set of pseudo-captions for each video to train the model.
Importantly, we show that both components are necessary to obtain high
accuracy. We evaluate REST on the problem of zero-shot action recognition where
we show that our approach is very competitive when compared to contrastive
learning-based methods. Code will be made available.

an effective applied magnetic field, plus additional terms that can cause
leakage out of the computational subspace. We demonstrate that, in the absence

between scattering and coalescing into a single black hole, there will be an
inspiral of many orbital rotations for $m_1c^2/E \ll 1$ and $m_2c^2/E \ll 1$
before a final black hole forms, during which all of the initial kinetic energy
will be radiated away in gravitational waves by the time the individual black
holes coalesce and settle down to a stationary state. In the massless limit
$m_1 = m_2 = 0$, in which the black holes are replaced by classical massless
point particles, it is conjectured that for the critical impact parameter, all
of the total energy will be radiated away by the time the two particle
worldlines merge and end. One might also conjecture that in the limit of
starting with the massless particles having infinite energy in the infinite
past with the correct ratio of impact parameter to energy, the spacetime for
retarded time before the final worldline merger at zero energy will have a
homothetic vector field and hence be self similar. Evidence against these
conjectures is also discussed, and if it proves correct, I conjecture that two
massless particles can form any number of black holes.

Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ac96e6",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present new radio and X-ray observations of two nearby ($< 4$ Mpc)
low-mass early-type galaxies with dynamically-confirmed central black holes:
NGC 5102 and NGC 205. NGC 5102 shows a weak nuclear X-ray source and has no
core radio emission. However, for the first time we demonstrate that it shows
luminous extended radio continuum emission in low-resolution, low-frequency ($<
3$ GHz) data, consistent with jet lobes on scales $\gtrsim 100$ pc formed from
past accretion and jet activity. By contrast, in new, extremely deep,
strictly-simultaneous Very Large Array and Chandra observations, no radio or
X-ray emission is detected from the black hole in NGC 205. We consider these
measurements and upper limits in the context of the few other low-mass
early-type galaxies with dynamically-confirmed black holes, and show that the
mean ratio of bolometric to Eddington luminosity in this sample is only
$\textrm{log} \, (L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}) = -6.57\pm0.50$. These Eddington
ratios are lower than typical in a comparison sample of more massive early-type
galaxies, though this conclusion is quite tentative due to our small sample of
low-mass galaxies and potential biases in the comparison sample. This
preliminary result is in mild tension with previous work using less sensitive
observations of more distant galaxies, which predict higher X-ray luminosities
than we observe for low-mass galaxies. If it is confirmed that central black
holes in low-mass galaxies typically have low Eddington ratios, this presents a
challenge to measuring the occupation fraction of central black holes with
standard optical emission line, X-ray, or radio surveys.

host a Magellanic Corona: a collisionally ionized, warm-hot gaseous halo at the
virial temperature (10^(5.3-5.5) K) initially extending out to the virial
radius (100-130 kpc). Such a Corona would have shaped the formation of the
Magellanic Stream (Lucchini et al. 2020), a tidal gas structure extending over
200 degrees across the sky (D'Onghia & Fox 2016, Besla et al. 2012, Nidever et

previously, with detections of highly ionized gas only reported in directions
directly toward the LMC, where winds from the LMC disk may dominate (deBoer &
Savage 1980, Wakker et al. 1998). Here we show evidence for this Magellanic
Corona with a potential direct detection in highly ionized oxygen (O^+5), and
indirectly via triply-ionized carbon and silicon, seen in ultraviolet

part of a pervasive multiphase Magellanic circumgalactic medium (CGM) seen in
many ionization states with a declining projected radial profile out to at
least 35 kpc from the LMC and a total ionized CGM mass of
log_10(M_HII;CGM/solar masses) = 9.1 +/- 0.2. The evidence for the Magellanic

absorbers, corresponding to a detection rate of 82$\pm$16 per cent. The
luminosity function of these LAEs is approximately 5 times higher in
normalization than the field population and we detect a significant clustering
of galaxies with respect to the gas, confirming that high column density
absorbers and LAEs trace each other. Between 30 and 40 per cent of the
absorbers are associated with multiple LAEs, which lie preferentially along
filaments. Galaxies in groups also exhibit a three times higher covering factor
of optically-thick gas compared to isolated systems. No significant
correlations are identified between the emission properties of LAEs and the
absorption properties of optically-thick gas clouds, except for a weak
preference of brighter and multiple galaxies to reside near broad absorbers.
Based on the measured impact parameters and the covering factor, we conclude
that the near totality of optically-thick gas in the Universe can be found in
the outer circumgalactic medium (CGM) of LAEs or in the intergalactic medium
(IGM) in proximity to these galaxies. Thus, LAEs act as tracers of larger scale
structures within which both galaxies and optically-thick clouds are embedded.
The patchy and inhomogeneous nature of the CGM and IGM explains the lack of
correlations between absorption and emission properties. This implies that very
large samples are needed to unveil the trends that encode the properties of the
baryon cycle.

half-light radius of $M(r<

corresponds to a mass-to-light ratio of
$\mathrm{[M/L]}_\mathrm{r_\mathrm{h}}=37^{+17}_{-15}\mathrm{~M}_\odot/\mathrm{L}_\odot$,

quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in crystalline systems with Chern bands. The lowest
Landau level (LLL) is known to host the FQHE, but not all Chern bands are
suitable for realizing fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Previous approaches
to stabilizing FCIs focused on mimicking the LLL through momentum space
criteria. Here instead we take a real-space perspective by introducing the
notion of vortexability. Vortexable Chern bands admit a fixed operator that
introduces vortices into any band wavefunction while keeping the state entirely
within the same band. Vortexable bands admit trial wavefunctions for FCI
states, akin to Laughlin states. In the absence of dispersion and for
sufficiently short ranged interactions, these FCI states are the ground state
-- independent of the distribution of Berry curvature. Vortexable bands are
much more general than the LLL, and we showcase a recipe for constructing them.
We exhibit diverse examples in graphene-based systems with or without magnetic
field, and with any Chern number. A special class of vortexable bands is shown
to be equivalent to the momentum space ``trace condition"" or ``ideal band
condition"". In addition, we also identify a more general form of vortexability
that goes beyond this criterion. We introduce a modified measure that
quantifies deviations from general vortexability which can be applied to
generic Chern bands to identify promising FCI platforms.

whose detection and characterization through time-series analysis allows us to
probe stellar interiors physics. Such analyses usually occur in the Fourier
domain by computing the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram, an estimator of the
\textit{power spectrum} underlying unevenly-sampled time-series data. However,
the LS periodogram suffers from the statistical problems of (1) inconsistency
(or noise) and (2) bias due to high spectral leakage. In addition, it is
designed to detect strictly periodic signals but is unsuitable for
non-sinusoidal periodic or quasi-periodic signals. Here, we develop a
multitaper spectral estimation method that tackles the inconsistency and bias
problems of the LS periodogram. We combine this multitaper method with the
Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (\texttt{mtNUFFT}) to more precisely
estimate the frequencies of asteroseismic signals that are non-sinusoidal
periodic (e.g., exoplanet transits) or quasi-periodic (e.g., pressure modes).
We illustrate this using a simulated and the Kepler-91 red giant light curve.
Particularly, we detect the Kepler-91b exoplanet and precisely estimate its
period, $6.246 \pm 0.002$ days, in the frequency domain using the multitaper
F-test alone. We also integrate \texttt{mtNUFFT} into the \texttt{PBjam}
package to obtain a Kepler-91 age estimate of $3.96 \pm 0.48$ Gyr. This $36$\%
improvement in age precision relative to the $4.27 \pm 0.75$ Gyr APOKASC-2
(uncorrected) estimate illustrates that \texttt{mtNUFFT} has promising
implications for Galactic archaeology, in addition to stellar interiors and
exoplanet studies. Our frequency analysis method generally applies to
time-domain astronomy and is implemented in the public Python package

transformations, are often exploited to improve the solution of learning tasks.
However, embedding these properties in models or learning algorithms can be
challenging and computationally intensive. Data augmentation, on the other
hand, induces these symmetries during training by applying multiple
transformations to the input data. Despite its ubiquity, its effectiveness
depends on the choices of which transformations to apply, when to do so, and
how often. In fact, there is both empirical and theoretical evidence that the
indiscriminate use of data augmentation can introduce biases that outweigh its
benefits. This work tackles these issues by automatically adapting the data
augmentation while solving the learning task. To do so, it formulates data
augmentation as an invariance-constrained learning problem and leverages Monte
Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling to solve it. The result is a practical
algorithm that not only does away with a priori searches for augmentation
distributions, but also dynamically controls if and when data augmentation is
applied. Our experiments illustrate the performance of this method, which
achieves state-of-the-art results in automatic data augmentation benchmarks for
CIFAR datasets. Furthermore, this approach can be used to gather insights on
the actual symmetries underlying a learning task.

models on correspondences between images from each instrument's pipeline. This
technique is common in computer vision, but several critical details are
required when using scanning slit spectrograph data like Hinode/SOT-SP. We
apply this technique to data spanning a decade of the Hinode mission. Our
results suggest corrections to the published Level 2 Hinode/SOT-SP data. First,
an analysis on approximately 2,700 scans suggests that the reported pixel size
in Hinode/SOT-SP Level 2 data is incorrect by around 1%. Second, analysis of
over 12,000 scans show that the pointing information is often incorrect by
dozens of arcseconds with a strong bias. Regression of these corrections
indicates that thermal effects have caused secular and cyclic drift in
Hinode/SOT-SP pointing data over its mission. We offer two solutions. First,
direct co-alignment with SDO/HMI data via our procedure can improve alignments
for many Hinode/SOT-SP scans. Second, since the pointing errors are
predictable, simple post-hoc corrections can substantially improve the
pointing. We conclude by illustrating the impact of this updated calibration on
derived physical data products needed for research and interpretation. Among
other things, our results suggest that the pointing errors induce a hemispheric
bias in estimates of radial current density.

investigate the effect of significant small-scale primordial non-Gaussianity on
structure formation and the galaxy formation process with collisionless
simulations: specifically, we explore four different types of
non-Gaussianities. All of these prescriptions lead to a distinct and
potentially detectable feature in the matter power spectrum around the
non-linear scale. The feature might have interesting consequences for the $S_8$
tension. We then show in particular that a negatively-skewed distribution of
the potential random field, hence positively skewed in terms of overdensities,
with $f_{\rm NL}$ of the order of 1000 at these scales, implies that typical
galaxy-sized halos reach half of their present-day mass at an earlier stage and
have a quieter merging history at $z<3$ than in the Gaussian case. Their
environment between 0.5 and 4 virial radii at $z=0$ is less dense than in the
Gaussian case. This quieter history and less dense environment has potentially
interesting consequences in terms of the formation of bulges and bars.
Moreover, we show that the two most massive subhalos around their host tend to
display an interesting anti-correlation of velocities, indicative of kinematic
coherence. All these hints will need to be statistically confirmed in
larger-box simulations with scale-dependent non-Gaussian initial conditions,
followed by hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations to explore the detailed

three-dimensional arrays on the Cerebras CS-2, a system whose memory and
processing elements reside on a single silicon wafer. The wafer-scale engine
(WSE) encompasses a two-dimensional mesh of roughly 850,000 processing elements
(PEs) with fast local memory and equally fast nearest-neighbor
interconnections.
  Our wafer-scale FFT (wsFFT) parallelizes a $n^3$ problem with up to $n^2$
PEs. At this point a PE processes only a single vector of the 3D domain (known
as a pencil) per superstep, where each of the three supersteps performs FFT
along one of the three axes of the input array. Between supersteps, wsFFT
redistributes (transposes) the data to bring all elements of each
one-dimensional pencil being transformed into the memory of a single PE. Each
redistribution causes an all-to-all communication along one of the mesh
dimensions. Given the level of parallelism, the size of the messages
transmitted between pairs of PEs can be as small as a single word. In theory, a
mesh is not ideal for all-to-all communication due to its limited bisection
bandwidth. However, the mesh interconnecting PEs on the WSE lies entirely
on-wafer and achieves nearly peak bandwidth even with tiny messages.
  This high efficiency on fine-grain communication allow wsFFT to achieve
unprecedented levels of parallelism and performance. We analyse in detail
computation and communication time, as well as the weak and strong scaling,
using both FP16 and FP32 precision. With 32-bit arithmetic on the CS-2, we
achieve 959 microseconds for 3D FFT of a $512^3$ complex input array using a
512x512 subgrid of the on-wafer PEs. This is the largest ever parallelization
for this problem size and the first implementation that breaks the millisecond

750k new galaxies with measured redshifts to the studied samples. The standard
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology having $H_0=(70\pm5)$ km/s/Mpc and number density tools
required for describing these galaxy distributions as single fractal systems
with dimension $D$ are adopted. We use the luminosity distance $d_L$, redshift
distance $d_z$ and galaxy area distance (transverse comoving distance) $d_G$ as
relativistic distance definitions to derive galaxy number densities in the
redshift interval $0.1\le z\le4$ at volume limited subsamples defined by
absolute magnitudes in the K-band. Similar to the findings of Teles et al.
(2021; arXiv:2012.07164), the results show two consecutive redshift scales
where galaxy distribution data behave as single fractal structures. For $z<1$
we found $D=1.00\pm0.12$ for the SPLASH galaxies, and $D=1,39\pm0.19$ for the
COSMOS2015. For $1\le z\le4$ we respectively found $D=0.83^{+0.36}_{-0.37}$ and
$D=0.54^{+0.27}_{-0.26}$. These results were verified to be robust under the
assumed Hubble constant uncertainty. Calculations considering blue and red
galaxies subsamples in both surveys showed that the fractal dimensions of blue
galaxies as basically unchanged, but the ones for the red galaxies changed
mostly to smaller values, meaning that $D$ may be seen as a more intrinsic
property of the distribution of objects in the Universe, therefore allowing for
the fractal dimension to be used as a tool to study different populations of
galaxies. All results confirm the decades old theoretical prediction of a
decrease in the fractal dimension for $z>1$.

provides a solution to the cosmological constant problem. With the

the finite blocklength regime. Second order achievable and converse rate
regions are presented. Both a global reliability requirement and per-user
reliability requirements are considered. The two-user case is analyzed in
detail, and generalizations to the $K$-user case are also discussed. The
largest second order achievable region presented here requires both
superposition and rate splitting in the code construction, as opposed to the
(infinite blocklength, first order) capacity region which does not require rate
splitting. Indeed, the finite blocklength penalty causes superposition alone to
under-perform other coding techniques in some parts of the region. In the
two-user case with per-user reliability requirements, the capacity achieving
superposition coding order (with the codeword of the user with the smallest SNR
as cloud center) does not necessarily gives the largest second order region.
Instead, the message of the user with the smallest point-to-point second order

generator without a dataset suffers from feedback sparsity, since it is
unlikely to generate a playable level via random exploration. A common solution
is shaped rewards, which guides the generator to achieve subgoals towards level
playability, but they consume effort to design and require game-specific domain
knowledge. This paper proposes a novel approach to train generators without
datasets or shaped rewards by learning at multiple level sizes starting from
small sizes and up to the desired sizes. The denser feedback at small sizes
negates the need for shaped rewards. Additionally, the generators learn to
build levels at various sizes, including sizes they were not trained for. We
apply our approach to train recurrent auto-regressive generative flow networks
(GFlowNets) for controllable level generation. We also adapt diversity sampling
to be compatible with GFlowNets. The results show that our generators create
diverse playable levels at various sizes for Sokoban, Zelda, and Danger Dave.
When compared with controllable reinforcement learning level generators for
Sokoban, the results show that our generators achieve better controllability
and competitive diversity, while being 9x faster at training and level
generation.

the most direct evidence of chiral Cooper pairing in some superconductors.
While it has been known that disorder or multiband pairing is typically needed
for these effects to manifest, there is a lack of direct real-space
investigation with regard to how disorder impacts the Hall response in both
single-band and multiband chiral superconductors. On the basis of the chiral
superconducting models often adopted for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, we study in this work
the anomalous Hall effect in the presence of random impurities on a real-space
lattice. The single-band chiral p-wave ($p_x+ip_y$) calculation qualitatively
reproduces the Hall conductivity obtained in previous skew-scattering-type
diagramatic analyses, along with some quantitative difference due primarily to
contributions involving impurity-induced in-gap states. The Hall response of
the non-p-wave chiral states (such as $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$), however, depends
sensitively on the form of the impurity potential as well as on the order
parameter self-consistency. In particular, while pointlike impurities induce
only minuscule Hall response in non-self-consistent calculations,
self-consistency and finite-range impurity potentials can both lead to
substantial Hall conductivity. On the other hand, the intrinsic Hall
conductivity in multiband chiral superconductors, which originates from
interband transitions, decreases parametrically as disorder suppresses the
superconducting order parameter. In addition, we check that random impurities
do not induce anomalous Hall effect in non-chiral but time-reversal symmetry
breaking superconducting states the likes of $s+i d_{x^2-y^2}$ and
$d_{x^2-y^2}+i g_{xy(x^2-y^2)}$. We briefly remark on the implications of our

constitute appreciable fractions of the breakup limit, resulting in centrifugal
expansion of these objects at the equator. According to models of internal
energy transport, this expansion ought to make the poles of a rotator
significantly hotter than the equator, so that inclination of the rotational
axis greatly affects both spectral shape and total flux. In this article, we
explore the dependence of a substellar object's observables on its rotational
speed and axis inclination. To do so, we combine PICASO (a Planetary Intensity
Code for Atmospheric Spectroscopy Observations) with software PARS (Paint the
Atmospheres of Rotating Stars). The former computer program models radiative
transfer within plane-parallel planetary atmospheres, while the latter computes
disk-integrated spectra of centrifugally deformed gaseous masses. We find that
the specific flux of a typical fast-rotating brown dwarf can increase by as
much as a factor of 1.5 with movement from an equator-on to a pole-on view. On
the other hand, the distinctive effect of rotation on spectral shape increases
toward the equator-on view. The latter effect also increases with lower
effective temperature. The bolometric luminosity estimate for a typical fast
rotator at extreme inclinations has to be adjusted by as much as about 20% due
to the anisotropy of the object's observed flux. We provide a general formula
for the calculation of the corresponding adjustment factor in terms of
rotational speed and inclination.

temporal walks (WA-TGNs), and those that augment local message passing with
recurrent memory modules (MP-TGNs). Specifically, novel constructions reveal
the inadequacy of MP-TGNs and WA-TGNs, proving that neither category subsumes
the other. We extend the 1-WL (Weisfeiler-Leman) test to temporal graphs, and
show that the most powerful MP-TGNs should use injective updates, as in this
case they become as expressive as the temporal WL. Also, we show that
sufficiently deep MP-TGNs cannot benefit from memory, and MP/WA-TGNs fail to
compute graph properties such as girth.
  These theoretical insights lead us to PINT -- a novel architecture that
leverages injective temporal message passing and relative positional features.
Importantly, PINT is provably more expressive than both MP-TGNs and WA-TGNs.
PINT significantly outperforms existing TGNs on several real-world benchmarks.

differences limited to tens of picometers RMS during exposure times of a few
hours. While the structural dynamics of a segmented mirror can be directly
stabilized with telescope metrology, another possibility is to use a
closed-loop wavefront sensing and control system in the coronagraph instrument
that operates during the science exposures to actively correct the wavefront
and relax the constraints on the stability of the telescope. In this paper, we
present simulations of the temporal filtering provided using the example of
LUVOIR-A, a 15~m segmented telescope concept. Assuming steady-state aberrations
based on a finite element model of the telescope structure, we (1)~optimize the
system to minimize the wavefront residuals, (2)~ use an end-to-end numerical
propagation model to estimate the residual starlight intensity at the science
detector, and (3)~predict the number of exoEarth candidates detected during the

down to 30~pm~RMS with a magnitude 0 star, improving the contrast performance
by a factor of 15. In scenarios where vibration frequencies are too fast for a
system that uses natural guide stars, laser sources can increase the flux at
the wavefront sensor to increase the servo-loop frequency and mitigate the high
temporal frequency wavefront errors. For example, an external laser with an
effective magnitude of -4 allows the wavefront from a telescope with 100~pm~RMS
dynamic errors and strong vibrations as fast as 16~Hz to be stabilized with
residual errors of 10~pm~RMS thereby increasing the number of detected planets

stellar clusters are the densest stellar system in the Universe, so they are
ideal places for runaway collisions to occur. Previous studies have proposed
the possible existence of a critical mass scale in such clusters, for which the
occurrence of collisions becomes very frequent and leads to the formation of a
very massive object. While it is difficult to directly probe this scenario with
simulations, we here aim for a proof of concept using toy models where the
occurrence of such a transition is shown based on simplified compact systems,
where the typical evolution time-scales will be faster compared to the real
Universe. Indeed our simulations confirm that such a transition takes place and
that up to 50 per cent of the cluster mass can go into the formation of a
central massive object for clusters that are above the critical mass scale. Our
results thus support the proposed new scenario on the basis of idealized
simulations. A preliminary analysis of observed nuclear star clusters shows
similar trends related to the critical mass as in our simulations. We further
discuss the caveats for the application of the proposed scenario in real
nuclear star clusters.

Manufacturing graphene-based electronic devices typically requires graphene
transfer from its growth substrate to another desired substrate. This key step
for device integration must be applicable at the wafer level and meet the
stringent requirements of semiconductor fabrication lines. In this work, wet
and semidry transfer (i.e. wafer bonding) are evaluated regarding wafer
scalability, handling, potential for automation, yield, contamination and
electrical performance. A wafer scale tool was developed to transfer graphene
from 150 mm copper foils to 200 mm silicon wafers with-out adhesive
intermediate polymers. The transferred graphene coverage ranged from 97.9% to
99.2% for wet transfer and from 17.2% to 90.8% for semidry transfer, with
average cop-per contaminations of 4.7x10$^{13}$ (wet) and 8.2x10$^{12}$
atoms/cm$^2$ (semidry). The corresponding electrical sheet resistance extracted
from terahertz time-domain spectroscopy varied from 450 to 550 ${\Omega}/sq$
for wet transfer and from 1000 to 1650 ${\Omega}/sq$ for semidry transfer.
Although wet transfer is superior in terms of yield, carbon contamination level
and electrical quality, wafer bonding yields lower copper contamination levels
and provides scalability due to existing in-dustrial tools and processes. Our
conclusions can be generalized to all two-dimensional (2D) materials.

Navier-Stokes equations on a finite-element mesh, incorporating the
centrifugal, Coriolis, self-gravitational, and tidal forces. The primary
functionality is to simulate the deformation of minor bodies under the
influence of tidal forces. It may therefore be used to constrain the
composition and physical structure of bodies experiencing significant tidal
forces, such as 99942 Apophis and 1I/`Oumuamua. We demonstrate that
$\texttt{SAMUS}$ will be useful to constrain the material properties of Apophis
during its near-Earth flyby in 2029. Depending on the material properties,
Apophis may experience an area change of up to 0.5\%, with similar effects on
the photometric brightness. We also apply $\texttt{SAMUS}$ to constrain the
material dynamic viscosity of 1I/`Oumuamua, the first interstellar object
discovered traversing the inner Solar System. `Oumuamua experienced a close
approach to the Sun at perihelion ($q\simeq 0.25$ au) during which there were
significant tidal forces that may have caused deformation of the body. This
deformation could have lead to observable changes in the photometric light
curve based on the material properties. The application of $\texttt{SAMUS}$ to
produce synthetic observations which incorporate tidal deformation effects
demonstrate that no deformation -- an infinite dynamic viscosity -- best
reproduces the photometric data. While these results indicate that `Oumuamua

reintroduced several ConvNet priors and further enhanced the practical

this work, we propose a lightweight volumetric ConvNet, termed 3D UX-Net, which
adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric
segmentation. Specifically, we revisit volumetric depth-wise convolutions with
large kernel size (e.g. starting from $7\times7\times7$) to enable the larger
global receptive fields, inspired by Swin Transformer. We further substitute
the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in Swin Transformer blocks with pointwise
depth convolutions and enhance model performances with fewer normalization and
activation layers, thus reducing the number of model parameters. 3D UX-Net
competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR) using three

sequence companion. Extremely bipolar, narrow-waisted proto-planetary nebulae
result in bipolar planetary nebulae, while the rest of the shapes mainly evolve
into elliptical planetary nebulae. The initial magnetic field's effects on the
collimated structures, such as jets, tend to disappear in most of the cases,
leaving behind the remnants of those features in only a few cases. Equatorial
zones fragmented mainly by photoionization ( 1 \Mo progenitors), result in
``necklace'' structures made of cometary clumps aligned with the radiation
field. On the other hand, fragmentation by photoionization and shocked wind (
2.5 \Mo progenitors) give rise to the formation of multiple clumps in the
latitudinal direction, which remain within the lobes, close to the center,
which are immersed and surrounded by hot shocked gas, not necessarily aligned
with the radiation field. These results reveal that the fragmentation process
has a dependence on the stellar mass progenitor. This fragmentation is made
possible by the distribution of gas in the previous post-common envelope

well-being. Obstetricians use it to observe the fetal heart rate (FHR) and the
uterine contraction (UC). The goal is to determine how the fetus reacts to the
contraction and whether it is receiving adequate oxygen. If a problem occurs,
the physician can then respond with an intervention. Unfortunately, the
interpretation of CTGs is highly subjective and there is a low inter- and
intra-observer agreement rate among practitioners. This can lead to unnecessary
medical intervention that represents a risk for both the mother and the fetus.
Recently, computer-assisted diagnosis techniques, especially based on
artificial intelligence models (mostly supervised), have been proposed in the
literature. But, many of these models lack generalization to unseen/test data
samples due to overfitting. Moreover, the unsupervised models were applied to a
very small portion of the CTG samples where the normal and abnormal classes are
highly separable. In this work, deep unsupervised learning approaches, trained
in a semi-supervised manner, are proposed for anomaly detection in CTG signals.
The GANomaly framework, modified to capture the underlying distribution of data
samples, is used as our main model and is applied to the CTU-UHB dataset.
Unlike the recent studies, all the CTG data samples, without any specific
preferences, are used in our work. The experimental results show that our

commonalities governing superficially dissimilar visual inputs. Recent efforts
to develop algorithms with this capacity have largely focused on approaches
that require extensive direct training on visual reasoning tasks, and yield
limited generalization to problems with novel content. In contrast, a long
tradition of research in cognitive science has focused on elucidating the
computational principles underlying human analogical reasoning; however, this
work has generally relied on manually constructed representations. Here we
present visiPAM (visual Probabilistic Analogical Mapping), a model of visual
reasoning that synthesizes these two approaches. VisiPAM employs learned
representations derived directly from naturalistic visual inputs, coupled with
a similarity-based mapping operation derived from cognitive theories of human
reasoning. We show that without any direct training, visiPAM outperforms a
state-of-the-art deep learning model on an analogical mapping task. In
addition, visiPAM closely matches the pattern of human performance on a novel
task involving mapping of 3D objects across disparate categories.

agents in an unknown and stochastic environment under hard constraints that
require the system state not to reach certain specified unsafe regions. Many
popular safe RL methods such as those based on the Constrained Markov Decision
Process (CMDP) paradigm formulate safety violations in a cost function and try
to constrain the expectation of cumulative cost under a threshold. However, it
is often difficult to effectively capture and enforce hard reachability-based
safety constraints indirectly with such constraints on safety violation costs.
In this work, we leverage the notion of barrier function to explicitly encode
the hard safety constraints, and given that the environment is unknown, relax
them to our design of \emph{generative-model-based soft barrier functions}.
Based on such soft barriers, we propose a safe RL approach that can jointly
learn the environment and optimize the control policy, while effectively
avoiding unsafe regions with safety probability optimization. Experiments on a
set of examples demonstrate that our approach can effectively enforce hard
safety constraints and significantly outperform CMDP-based baseline methods in
system safe rate measured via simulations.

Integration factor (IF) or exponential differencing time (ETD) methods are one
of the popular methods for temporal partial differential equations (PDEs) among
many other methods. In our paper, we couple ETD methods with an embedded
boundary method to solve a system of reaction-diffusion equations with complex

of specific {\phi}-functions and apply one start-of-the-art algorithm to
compute the matrix-vector multiplications, which offers significant
computational advantages with adaptive Krylov subspaces. In addition, we extend
this method by incorporating the level set method to solve the free boundary
problem. The accuracy, stability, and efficiency of the developed method are
demonstrated by numerical examples.

clustering is a flexible framework to tackle data heterogeneity when the

classic expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is a computationally thrifty
iterative method that maximizes a surrogate function minorizing the
log-likelihood of observed data in each iteration, which however suffers from
bad local maxima even in the special case of the standard Gaussian mixture
model with common isotropic covariance matrices. On the other hand, recent
studies reveal that the unique global solution of a semidefinite programming
(SDP) relaxed $K$-means achieves the information-theoretically sharp threshold
for perfectly recovering the cluster labels under the standard Gaussian mixture
model. In this paper, we extend the SDP approach to a general setting by
integrating cluster labels as model parameters and propose an iterative
likelihood adjusted SDP (iLA-SDP) method that directly maximizes the exact
observed likelihood in the presence of data heterogeneity. By lifting the
cluster assignment to group-specific membership matrices, iLA-SDP avoids
centroids estimation -- a key feature that allows exact recovery under
well-separateness of centroids without being trapped by their adversarial
configurations. Thus iLA-SDP is less sensitive than EM to initialization and
more stable on high-dimensional data. Our numeric experiments demonstrate that
iLA-SDP can achieve lower mis-clustering errors over several widely used
clustering methods including $K$-means, SDP and EM algorithms.

the fundamental scalar fields. There are exactly 36 scalar fields in the model,
which are distinguishable by flavor indices on the fields. This is the precise
number of zero dimension scalar fields that leads to a vanishing Weyl anomaly
and a vanishing vacuum energy. Precisely the same number of these very same
scalar fields is required for the coupling of all of the different standard
model fermions to the vielbein field. At the same time their interaction with
fermions gives rise to fermion mass terms, without the need to introduce a
fundamental Higgs field. Within the proposed theory we construct a toy model
that deals solely with the top and bottom quarks, and we demonstrate that their
observable masses can appear in the action dynamically. Moreover, this
mechanism allows for the top and bottom quarks to acquire distinctly different

for suitable $\sigma_0^2$, we establish a $O(\frac{\text{poly}(L)}{\sqrt{m}})$

$\Omega(\frac{\text{poly}(L)}{\sqrt{m}})$ for the square loss. We also present
results for more general losses. The RSC based analysis does not need the
``near initialization"" perspective and guarantees geometric convergence for
gradient descent (GD). To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first result
on establishing geometric convergence of GD based on RSC for deep learning
models, thus becoming an alternative sufficient condition for convergence that
does not depend on the widely-used Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). We share

apps may gradually shift their focus to non-standard and covert channels for
leaking private user/device information. Such leaks also remain largely
undetected by state-of-the-art privacy analysis tools, which are very effective
in uncovering privacy exposures via regular HTTP and HTTPS channels. In this
study, we design and implement, ThirdEye, to significantly extend the
visibility of current privacy analysis tools, in terms of the exposures that
happen across various non-standard and covert channels, i.e., via any protocol
over TCP/UDP (beyond HTTP/S), and using multi-layer custom encryption over
HTTP/S and non-HTTP protocols. Besides network exposures, we also consider
covert channels via storage media that also leverage custom encryption layers.
Using ThirdEye, we analyzed 12,598 top-apps in various categories from
Androidrank, and found that 2887/12,598 (22.92%) apps used custom
encryption/decryption for network transmission and storing content in shared
device storage, and 2465/2887 (85.38%) of those apps sent device information
(e.g., advertising ID, list of installed apps) over the network that can
fingerprint users. Besides, 299 apps transmitted insecure encrypted content
over HTTP/non-HTTP protocols; 22 apps that used authentication tokens over
HTTPS, happen to expose them over insecure (albeit custom encrypted)
HTTP/non-HTTP channels. We found non-standard and covert channels with multiple
levels of obfuscation (e.g., encrypted data over HTTPS, encryption at nested
levels), and the use of vulnerable keys and cryptographic algorithms. Our
findings can provide valuable insights into the evolving field of non-standard

redshift which indicates that the RM values are due mostly to the FRB host
contribution. This assertion is further supported by strong correlations
(Spearman test probabilities $P_S \simeq 0.05$) found between RM and the
estimated host dispersion measure ($DM_{Host}$) and host-normalized
galacto-centric offset (Spearman $r_S$ values equal to 0.64 and -0.52). For
these nine galaxies, we estimate their magnetic field strengths projected along
the sightline $B$ finding a low median value of $0.5 \mu G$. This implies the
magnetic fields of our sample of hosts are weaker than those characteristic of
the Solar neighborhood ($\approx 6 \mu G$), but relatively consistent with a
lower limit on observed range of $2-10 \mu G$ for star-forming, disk galaxies,
especially as we consider reversals in the B-field, and that we are only
probing $B_{\parallel}$. We compare to RMs from simulated galaxies of the
Auriga project -- magneto-hydrodynamic cosmological zoom simulations - and find
that the simulations predict the observed values to within the $95\%$ CI.
Upcoming FRB surveys will provide hundreds of new FRBs with high-precision

  We present the development and assessment of a wave modeling framework with

availability of real-time wave spectra from low-cost wave measurement buoys
allows for operational data assimilation with the ensemble Kalman filter
technique within a hybrid modeling procedure whereby physics-based numerical
wave models are combined with data-driven error models that aim to capture the
discrepancy in prescribed boundary conditions. With that aim, measured wave
spectra are assimilated for combined state and parameter estimation while
taking into account model and observational errors. The analysis allows for
more accurate and precise wave characteristic predictions at the locations of

W&T) of the potential geopolitical fallout of the success of SETI. They
conclude that ""passive"" SETI involves an underexplored yet significant risk
that, in the event of a successful, passive detection of extraterrestrial
technology, state-level actors could seek to gain an information monopoly on
communications with an ETI. These attempts could lead to international conflict
and potentially disastrous consequences. In response to this possibility, they
argue that scientists and facilities engaged in SETI should preemptively engage
in significant security protocols to forestall this risk.
  We find several flaws in their analysis. While we do not dispute that a
realpolitik response is possible, we uncover concerns with W&T's presentation
of the realpolitik paradigm, and we argue that sufficient reason is not given
to justify treating this potential scenario as action-guiding over other
candidate geopolitical responses. Furthermore, even if one assumes that a
realpolitik response is the most relevant geopolitical response, we show that
it is highly unlikely that a nation could successfully monopolize communication
with ETI. Instead, the real threat that the authors identify is based on the
perception by state actors that an information monopoly is likely. However, as
we show, this perception is based on an overly narrow contact scenario.
  Overall, we critique W&T's argument and resulting recommendations on
technical, political, and ethical grounds. Ultimately, we find that not only
are W&T's recommendations unlikely to work, they may also precipitate the very
ills that they foresee. As an alternative, we recommend transparency and data
sharing (which are consistent with currently accepted best practices), further
development of post-detection protocols, and better education of policymakers
in this space.

total space equipped with the Euclidean metric. When the original objective f
satisfies standard restricted strong convexity and smoothness properties, we
characterize the global landscape of the factorized objective under the

where the factorized objective is geodesically strongly convex and smooth; (R2)
the region containing neighborhoods of all strict saddle points; (R3) the
remaining regions, where the factorized objective has a large gradient. To our

in one sweeping motion or pushing off a wall to quickly turn a corner is a
challenging problem. The dynamic interactions implicit in these tasks are
critical towards the successful execution of such tasks. Graph neural networks
(GNNs) provide a principled way of learning the dynamics of interactive systems
but can suffer from scaling issues as the number of interactions increases.
Furthermore, the problem of using learned GNN-based models for optimal control
is insufficiently explored. In this work, we present a method for efficiently
learning the dynamics of interacting systems by simultaneously learning a
dynamic graph structure and a stable and locally linear forward model of the
system. The dynamic graph structure encodes evolving contact modes along a
trajectory by making probabilistic predictions over the edges of the graph.
Additionally, we introduce a temporal dependence in the learned graph structure
which allows us to incorporate contact measurement updates during execution
thus enabling more accurate forward predictions. The learned stable and locally
linear dynamics enable the use of optimal control algorithms such as iLQR for
long-horizon planning and control for complex interactive tasks. Through
experiments in simulation and in the real world, we evaluate the performance of
our method by using the learned interaction dynamics for control and
demonstrate generalization to more objects and interactions not seen during
training. We introduce a control scheme that takes advantage of contact
measurement updates and hence is robust to prediction inaccuracies during
execution.

differently from person to person, complicating the development of a generic

labeled datasets that can be utilized to build machine learning models for
accurately detecting periods and levels of stress. The aim of this review is to
provide an overview of the current state of stress detection and monitoring
using wearable devices, and where applicable, machine learning techniques
utilized.
  Methods. This study reviewed published works contributing and/or using
datasets designed for detecting stress and their associated machine learning
methods, with a systematic review and meta-analysis of those that utilized
wearable sensor data as stress biomarkers. The electronic databases of Google
Scholar, Crossref, DOAJ and PubMed were searched for relevant articles and a
total of 24 articles were identified and included in the final analysis. The
reviewed works were synthesized into three categories of publicly available
stress datasets, machine learning, and future research directions.
  Results. A wide variety of study-specific test and measurement protocols were
noted in the literature. A number of public datasets were identified that are
labeled for stress detection. In addition, we discuss that previous works show
shortcomings in areas such as their labeling protocols, lack of statistical
power, validity of stress biomarkers, and generalization ability.
  Conclusion. Generalization of existing machine learning models still require
further study, and research in this area will continue to provide improvements
as newer and more substantial datasets become available for study.

bounded poset $P$ which has a CL-labeling $\lambda$. We call this the maximal
chain descent order induced by $\lambda$, denoted $P_{\lambda}(2)$. As a first
example, letting $P$ be the Boolean lattice and $\lambda$ its standard
EL-labeling gives $P_{\lambda}(2)$ isomorphic to the weak order of type A. We
discuss in depth other seemingly well-structured examples: the max-min
EL-labeling of the partition lattice gives maximal chain descent order
isomorphic to a partial order on certain labeled trees, and particular cases of
the linear extension EL-labelings of finite distributive lattices produce
maximal chain descent orders isomorphic to partial orders on standard Young
tableaux. We observe that the order relations which one might expect to be the
cover relations, those given by the ""polygon moves"" whose transitive closure
defines the maximal chain descent order, are not always cover relations.
Several examples illustrate this fact. Nonetheless, we characterize the
EL-labelings for which every polygon move gives a cover relation, and we prove
many well known EL-labelings do have the expected cover relations. One
motivation for $P_{\lambda}(2)$ is that its linear extensions give all of the
shellings of the order complex of $P$ whose restriction maps are defined by the
descents with respect to $\lambda$. This yields strictly more shellings of $P$
than the lexicographic ones induced by $\lambda$. Thus, the maximal chain
descent order $P_{\lambda}(2)$ might be thought of as encoding the structure of
the set of shellings induced by $\lambda$.

commonplace, and as detectors improve and gravitational wave sources become
more varied, it is increasingly important to have dense and expansive template
banks of predicted gravitational waveforms. Since numerical relativity is the
only way to fully solve the non-linear merger regime of general relativity for
comparably massed systems, numerical relativity simulations are critical for
gravitational wave detection and analysis. These simulations are
computationally expensive, with each simulation placing one point within the
high dimensional parameter space of binary black hole coalescences. This makes
it important to have a method of placing new simulations in ways that use our
computational resources optimally while ensuring sufficient coverage of the
parameter space. Accomplishing this requires predicting the impact of a new set
of parameters before performing the simulation. To this effect, this paper
introduces a neural network to predict the mismatch between the gravitational
waves of two binary systems. Using this network, we then show how we can
propose new numerical relativity simulations that will provide the most
benefit. We also use the network to identify gaps in existing public catalogs
and identify degeneracies in the binary black hole parameter space.

Multivalid coverage guarantees are stronger than marginal coverage guarantees
in two ways: (1) They hold even conditional on group membership -- that is, the
target coverage level $1-\alpha$ holds conditionally on membership in each of
an arbitrary (potentially intersecting) group in a finite collection
$\mathcal{G}$ of regions in the feature space. (2) They hold even conditional
on the value of the threshold used to produce the prediction set on a given
example. In fact multivalid coverage guarantees hold even when conditioning on
group membership and threshold value simultaneously.
  We give two algorithms: both take as input an arbitrary non-conformity score
and an arbitrary collection of possibly intersecting groups $\mathcal{G}$, and
then can equip arbitrary black-box predictors with prediction sets. Our first
algorithm (BatchGCP) is a direct extension of quantile regression, needs to
solve only a single convex minimization problem, and produces an estimator
which has group-conditional guarantees for each group in $\mathcal{G}$. Our
second algorithm (BatchMVP) is iterative, and gives the full guarantees of
multivalid conformal prediction: prediction sets that are valid conditionally
both on group membership and non-conformity threshold. We evaluate the
performance of both of our algorithms in an extensive set of experiments. Code

protocols. Next, we propose and evaluate methods combining these datasets into
a single, large dataset. Finally, we propose and evaluate the use of ensemble
techniques by combining gradient boosting with an artificial neural network to
measure predictive power on new, unseen data.
  Methods. Sensor biomarker data from six public datasets were utilized in this
study. To test model generalization, we developed a gradient boosting model
trained on one dataset (SWELL), and tested its predictive power on two datasets
previously used in other studies (WESAD, NEURO). Next, we merged four small
datasets, i.e. (SWELL, NEURO, WESAD, UBFC-Phys), to provide a combined total of
99 subjects,. In addition, we utilized random sampling combined with another
dataset (EXAM) to build a larger training dataset consisting of 200 synthesized
subjects,. Finally, we developed an ensemble model that combines our gradient
boosting model with an artificial neural network, and tested it on two
additional, unseen publicly available stress datasets (WESAD and Toadstool).
  Results. Our method delivers a robust stress measurement system capable of
achieving 85% predictive accuracy on new, unseen validation data, achieving a
25% performance improvement over single models trained on small datasets.
  Conclusion. Models trained on small, single study protocol datasets do not
generalize well for use on new, unseen data and lack statistical power.
Ma-chine learning models trained on a dataset containing a larger number of
varied study subjects capture physiological variance better, resulting in more
robust stress detection.

run our embedded system in a vehicle. To determine this, we ran communication
speed tests and evaluated total processing times for inference operations.
Based on our experiments, the average total processing time to run the
drowsiness detection model was 94.27 ms for Jetson Nano and 22.73 ms for the
Beelink (Mini PC). Considering the portability and power efficiency of each

introduces a novel neural implicit scene representation with volume rendering
for high-fidelity online 3D scene reconstruction from monocular videos. For

perform the online neural 3D reconstruction from monocular videos, by which the
3D scene geometry is efficiently generated and optimized during the on-the-fly

programmable wireless transmission environments. Owing to the massive number of
controllable reflecting elements on the surface, RIS is capable of providing
considerable passive beamforming gains. At present, most related works mainly
consider the modeling, design, performance analysis and optimization of
single-RIS-assisted systems. Although there are a few of works that investigate
multiple RISs individually serving their associated users, the cooperation
among multiple RISs is not well considered as yet. To fill the gap, this paper
studies a cooperative beamforming design for multi-RIS-assisted communication
systems, where multiple RISs are deployed to assist the downlink communications
from a base station to its users. To do so, we first model the general channel
from the base station to the users for arbitrary number of reflection links.
Then, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum rate of all
users. Analysis shows that the formulated problem is difficult to solve due to
its non-convexity and the interactions among the decision variables. To solve
it effectively, we first decouple the problem into three disjoint subproblems.
Then, by introducing appropriate auxiliary variables, we derive the closed-form
expressions for the decision variables and propose a low-complexity cooperative
beamforming algorithm. Simulation results have verified the effectiveness of
the proposed algorithm through comparison with various baseline methods.
Furthermore, these results also unveil that, for the sum rate maximization,
distributing the reflecting elements among multiple RISs is superior to
deploying them at one single RIS.

Li in these stars is greater than a factor of 400, the spread in Be is only 2.7

features of the non-linguistic world is an open question. Prior work has shown
that pretrained LMs can be taught to caption images when a vision model's
parameters are optimized to encode images in the language space. We test a
stronger hypothesis: that the conceptual representations learned by frozen
text-only models and vision-only models are similar enough that this can be
achieved with a linear map. We show that the image representations from vision
models can be transferred as continuous prompts to frozen LMs by training only
a single linear projection. Using these to prompt the LM achieves competitive
performance on captioning and visual question answering tasks compared to
models that tune both the image encoder and text decoder (such as the MAGMA
model). We compare three image encoders with increasing amounts of linguistic
supervision seen during pretraining: BEIT (no linguistic information),
NF-ResNET (lexical category information), and CLIP (full natural language
descriptions). We find that all three encoders perform equally well at
transferring visual property information to the language model (e.g., whether
an animal is large or small), but that image encoders pretrained with
linguistic supervision more saliently encode category information (e.g.,
distinguishing hippo vs. elephant) and thus perform significantly better on
benchmark language-and-vision tasks. Our results indicate that LMs encode
conceptual information structurally similarly to vision-based models, even
those that are solely trained on images. Code is available here:

encourage aligning user trajectories with the underlying user satisfaction?
Three research questions are key: (1) measuring user satisfaction, (2)
combatting sparsity of satisfaction signals, and (3) adapting the training of
the recommender agent to maximize satisfaction. For measurement, it has been
found that surveys explicitly asking users to rate their experience with
consumed items can provide valuable orthogonal information to the
engagement/interaction data, acting as a proxy to the underlying user
satisfaction. For sparsity, i.e, only being able to observe how satisfied users
are with a tiny fraction of user-item interactions, imputation models can be
useful in predicting satisfaction level for all items users have consumed. For
learning satisfying recommender policies, we postulate that reward shaping in
RL recommender agents is powerful for driving satisfying user experiences.
Putting everything together, we propose to jointly learn a policy network and a
satisfaction imputation network: The role of the imputation network is to learn
which actions are satisfying to the user; while the policy network, built on
top of REINFORCE, decides which items to recommend, with the reward utilizing
the imputed satisfaction. We use both offline analysis and live experiments in
an industrial large-scale recommendation platform to demonstrate the promise of
our approach for satisfying user experiences.

jamming to ensure information secrecy even if the D2D transmissions are
detected. We model the combat between the wardens and the D2D network (the
transmitters and the friendly jammers) as a two-stage Stackelberg game.
Therein, the wardens are the followers at the lower stage aiming to minimize
their detection errors, and the D2D network is the leader at the upper stage
aiming to maximize its utility (in terms of link reliability and communication
security) subject to the constraint on communication covertness. We apply
stochastic geometry to model the network spatial configuration so as to conduct
a system-level study. We develop a bi-level optimization algorithm to search
for the equilibrium of the proposed Stackelberg game based on the successive

reveal interesting insights. We observe that without the assistance from the

Moreover, we illustrate the advantages of the proposed friendly

predict the binding ligand structures along with their regulatory effects on
protein folding. To address this discrepancy, we present NeuralPLexer, a
computational approach that can directly predict protein-ligand complex

NeuralPLexer adopts a deep generative model to sample the 3D structures of the
binding complex and their conformational changes at an atomistic resolution.
The model is based on a diffusion process that incorporates essential
biophysical constraints and a multi-scale geometric deep learning system to
iteratively sample residue-level contact maps and all heavy-atom coordinates in
a hierarchical manner. NeuralPLexer achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to all existing methods on benchmarks for both protein-ligand blind

specificity in sampling both ligand-free-state and ligand-bound-state
ensembles, NeuralPLexer consistently outperforms AlphaFold2 in terms of global
protein structure accuracy on both representative structure pairs with large
conformational changes (average TM-score=0.93) and recently determined

One of the preliminary assumptions of these models is the independent and
identical distribution, which suggests that the train and test data are sampled
from the same distribution. However, this assumption seldom holds in the real

assumption exhibit poor generalization capabilities. Over the recent years,
dedicated efforts have been made to improve the generalization capabilities of
these models collectively known as -- \textit{domain generalization methods}.
The primary idea behind these methods is to identify stable features or
mechanisms that remain invariant across the different distributions. Many
generalization approaches employ causal theories to describe invariance since
causality and invariance are inextricably intertwined. However, current surveys
deal with the causality-aware domain generalization methods on a very
high-level. Furthermore, we argue that it is possible to categorize the methods

generalization methods into three categories, namely, (i) Invariance via Causal
Data Augmentation methods which are applied during the data pre-processing
stage, (ii) Invariance via Causal representation learning methods that are
utilized during the representation learning stage, and (iii) Invariance via

  Recognition",,,,,"cs.HC cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human state recognition is a critical topic with pervasive and important
applications in human-machine systems. Multi-modal fusion, the combination of
metrics from multiple data sources, has been shown as a sound method for
improving the recognition performance. However, while promising results have
been reported by recent multi-modal-based models, they generally fail to
leverage the sophisticated fusion strategies that would model sufficient
cross-modal interactions when producing the fusion representation; instead,
current methods rely on lengthy and inconsistent data preprocessing and feature
crafting. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end multi-modal
transformer framework for multi-modal human state recognition called Husformer.
Specifically, we propose to use cross-modal transformers, which inspire one
modality to reinforce itself through directly attending to latent relevance
revealed in other modalities, to fuse different modalities while ensuring
sufficient awareness of the cross-modal interactions introduced. Subsequently,
we utilize a self-attention transformer to further prioritize contextual
information in the fusion representation. Using two such attention mechanisms
enables effective and adaptive adjustments to noise and interruptions in
multi-modal signals during the fusion process and in relation to high-level
features. Extensive experiments on two human emotion corpora (DEAP and WESAD)
and two cognitive workload datasets (MOCAS and CogLoad) demonstrate that in the
recognition of human state, our Husformer outperforms both state-of-the-art
multi-modal baselines and the use of a single modality by a large margin,
especially when dealing with raw multi-modal signals. We also conducted an
ablation study to show the benefits of each component in Husformer.

device to realize the QHE is generally much larger than the phase coherence
length, in which the quantum coherence of electrons is destroyed. Here, we
theoretically study the influence of dephasing effect on the quantized Hall
(QH) plateaus. We find that the QH plateau disappears in perfectly quantum
coherent systems if the coupling between leads and central region is imperfect.
The Hall resistance is very large and strongly oscillates instead of presenting
the QH plateau in this case. However, by introducing the dephasing, the Hall
resistance decreases and the QH plateau appears gradually. Similar results can
also be observed for the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Our results propose

proposes to apply context distillation so that a language model can improve
itself by internalizing these gains. Concretely, given a synthetic unlabeled

the same model to predict its own ``[final answer]'' conditioned on the

  We show that context distillation is a general method to train language
models, and it can effectively internalize 3 types of training signals. First,
it can internalize abstract task instructions and explanations, so we can
iteratively update the model parameters with new instructions and overwrite old
ones. Second, it can internalize step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks
(e.g., 8-digit addition), and such a newly acquired capability proves to be
useful for other downstream tasks. Finally, it can internalize concrete

by 9\% on the SPIDER Text-to-SQL dataset; furthermore, combining context
distillation operations can internalize more training examples than the context

to be a challenging task, even with the latest breakthroughs in deep neural
language models. We first examined popular methodologies in measuring taxonomic
similarity, including edge-counting that solely employs semantic relations in a
taxonomy, as well as the complex methods that estimate concept specificity. We
further extrapolated three weighting factors in modelling taxonomic similarity.
To study the distinct mechanisms between taxonomic and distributional
similarity measures, we ran head-to-head comparisons of each measure with human
similarity judgements from the perspectives of word frequency, polysemy degree
and similarity intensity. Our findings suggest that without fine-tuning the
uniform distance, taxonomic similarity measures can depend on the shortest path
length as a prime factor to predict semantic similarity; in contrast to
distributional semantics, edge-counting is free from sense distribution bias in
use and can measure word similarity both literally and metaphorically; the
synergy of retrofitting neural embeddings with concept relations in similarity
prediction may indicate a new trend to leverage knowledge bases on transfer
learning. It appears that a large gap still exists on computing semantic
similarity among different ranges of word frequency, polysemous degree and

and the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system in the whole space. Our main purpose is
two-fold: the first one is to give a rigorous derivation of the compressible
Euler equations from the Landau equation via the Hilbert expansion; while the
second one is to prove, still in the setting of Hilbert expansion, that the
unique classical solution of the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system converges, which
is shown to be globally in time, to the resulting global smooth solution of the
Euler-Maxwell system, as the Knudsen number goes to zero. The main ingredient
of our analysis is to derive some novel interplay energy estimates on the
solutions of the Landau equation and the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system which are
small perturbations of both a local Maxwellian and a global Maxwellian,
respectively. Our result solves an open problem in the hydrodynamic limit for
the Landau-type equations with Coulomb potential and the approach developed in
this paper can seamlessly be used to deal with the problem on the validity of
the Hilbert expansion for other types of kinetic equations.

distributed training is often used. One of the largest bottlenecks in
distributed training is communicating gradients across different nodes.
Different gradient compression techniques have been proposed to alleviate the
communication bottleneck, including topK gradient sparsification, which
truncates the gradient to the largest K components before sending it to other
nodes. While some authors have investigated topK gradient sparsification in the
parameter-server framework by applying topK compression in both the
worker-to-server (uplink) and server-to-worker (downlink) direction, the
currently accepted belief says that adding extra compression degrades the
convergence of the model. We demonstrate, on the contrary, that adding downlink
compression can potentially improve the performance of topK sparsification: not
only does it reduce the amount of communication per step, but also,
counter-intuitively, can improve the upper bound in the convergence analysis.
To show this, we revisit non-convex convergence analysis of topK stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) and extend it from the unidirectional to the
bidirectional setting. We also remove a restriction of the previous analysis
that requires unrealistically large values of K. We experimentally evaluate
bidirectional topK SGD against unidirectional topK SGD and show that models
trained with bidirectional topK SGD will perform as well as models trained with
unidirectional topK SGD while yielding significant communication benefits for
large numbers of workers.

existing methods that learn a single skill prior from a large and diverse
dataset, our framework learns a library of different distinction skill priors
(i.e., behavior priors) from a collection of specialized datasets, and learns
how to combine them to solve a new task. This formulation allows the algorithm
to acquire a set of specialized skill priors that are more reusable for
downstream tasks; however, it also brings up additional challenges of how to
effectively combine these unstructured sets of skill priors to form a new prior
for new tasks. Specifically, it requires the agent not only to identify which
skill prior(s) to use but also how to combine them (either sequentially or
concurrently) to form a new prior. To achieve this goal, ASPiRe includes
Adaptive Weight Module (AWM) that learns to infer an adaptive weight assignment
between different skill priors and uses them to guide policy learning for
downstream tasks via weighted Kullback-Leibler divergences. Our experiments
demonstrate that ASPiRe can significantly accelerate the learning of new
downstream tasks in the presence of multiple priors and show improvement on

to radically lower its electrical conductance. The high power and concomitantly
high current density required to reset phase change materials is the major
issue that limits the access times of 3D phase change memory architectures.
Phase change superlattices were developed to lower the reset energy by
confining the phase transition to the interface between two different phase
change materials. However, the high thermal conductivity of the superlattices
means that heat is poorly confined within the phase change material, and most
of the thermal energy is wasted to the surrounding materials. Here, we
identified Ti as a useful dopant for substantially lowering the thermal
conductivity of Sb2Te3-GeTe superlattices whilst also stabilising the layered
structure from unwanted disordering. We demonstrate via laser heating that
lowering the thermal conductivity by doping the Sb2Te3 layers with Ti halves
the switching energy compared to superlattices that only use interfacial phase
change transitions and strain engineering. The thermally optimized superlattice
has (0 0 l) crystallographic orientation yet a thermal conductivity of just
0.25 W/m.K in the ""on"" (set) state. Prototype phase change memory devices that
incorporate this Ti-doped superlattice switch faster and and at a substantially
lower voltage than the undoped superlattice. During switching the Ti-doped
Sb2Te3 layers remain stable within the superlattice and only the Ge atoms are
active and undergo interfacial phase transitions. In conclusion, we show the
potential of thermally optimised Sb2Te3-GeTe superlattices for a new generation
of energy-efficient electrical and optical phase change memory.

understanding of exotic nuclei in different mass regions encompassing almost
the entire nuclear chart. This is achieved through determining multiple
fundamental properties of nuclear ground and isomeric states, such as nuclear
spins, magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments and charge radii, via
the measurement of hyperfine structures and isotope shifts in the atomic or
ionic spectra of the nuclei of interest. These properties, when measured with

can remove interstellar gas from galaxies in a cluster. The RPS process is
commonly described as a competition between the ram pressure by the
intracluster medium (ICM) and the anchoring pressure on the interstellar medium
(ISM) by the gravitational potential of a galaxy. However, the actual gas
stripping process can be more complicated due to the complexity of gas physics
such as compression and geometrical self-shielding as well as cooling and
heating. In order to verify how well the observed signatures of the RPS process
can be understood as simple momentum transfer, we compare the stripping radii
of Virgo cluster galaxies in different stages of RPS measured from the HI
observation with the predicted gas truncation radii for the given conditions.
For the sample undergoing active RPS, we generally find good agreements between
predictions and observations within a measurement uncertainty. On the other
hand, galaxies likely in the early or later RPS stage and/or the ones with
signs of environmental impacts other than RPS such as tidal interaction or
starvation, show some discrepancies. Our results imply that the conventional
RPS relation works reasonably well in a broad sense when RPS is the most
dominant process and the galaxy is located where the surrounding environment
can be well defined. Otherwise, more careful inspections on the second
mechanism and local environment are required to assess the impact of RPS on the

a perpetual soft item cold start issue. Our system aims to recommend demanded
products to prospective sellers for listing in Amazon stores. These products
always have only few interactions thereby giving rise to a perpetual soft item
cold start situation. Modern collaborative filtering methods solve cold start
using content attributes and exploit the existing implicit signals from warm
start items. This approach fails in our use-case since our entire item set
faces cold start issue always. Our Product Graph has over 500 Million nodes and
over 5 Billion edges which makes training and inference using modern graph
algorithms very compute intensive. To overcome these challenges we propose a
system which reduces the dataset size and employs an improved modelling
technique to reduce storage and compute without loss in performance.
Particularly, we reduce our graph size using a filtering technique and then
exploit this reduced product graph using Weighted Averaging of Messages over
Layers (WAML) algorithm. WAML simplifies training on large graphs and improves
over previous methods by reducing compute time to 1/7 of LightGCN and 1/26 of
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and increasing recall$@100$ by 66% over LightGCN
and 2.3x over GAT.

pre-trained models. Unlike the unified pre-training strategy employed in the
language field, the graph field exhibits diverse pre-training strategies,
posing challenges in designing appropriate prompt-based tuning methods for
graph neural networks. While some pioneering work has devised specialized
prompting functions for models that employ edge prediction as their
pre-training tasks, these methods are limited to specific pre-trained GNN
models and lack broader applicability. In this paper, we introduce a universal
prompt-based tuning method called Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) for pre-trained
GNN models under any pre-training strategy. GPF operates on the input graph's
feature space and can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect to any form of
prompting function. Consequently, we no longer need to illustrate the prompting
function corresponding to each pre-training strategy explicitly. Instead, we
employ GPF to obtain the prompted graph for the downstream task in an adaptive
manner. We provide rigorous derivations to demonstrate the universality of GPF
and make guarantee of its effectiveness. The experimental results under various
pre-training strategies indicate that our method performs better than
fine-tuning, with an average improvement of about 1.4% in full-shot scenarios
and about 3.2% in few-shot scenarios. Moreover, our method significantly
outperforms existing specialized prompt-based tuning methods when applied to
models utilizing the pre-training strategy they specialize in. These numerous
advantages position our method as a compelling alternative to fine-tuning for
downstream adaptations.

Our model
is based on explicit smooth confinement (namely confinement without chiral
symmetry breaking in a supersymmetric gauge theory) at an intermediate energy
scale, before the electroweak symmetry breaking by the Higgs condensation at
lower energy. In our context, the smooth confinement preserves the SU(3) and
the chiral SU(2)$_L\times$ U(1)$_Y$ symmetry in a supersymmetric Standard
Model, while this internal symmetry becomes dynamically gauged in the end. In
contrast to Razamat-Tong's symmetric mass generation model also preserving the

our model introduces different matter contents with a different kind of

terms marginal at IR, breaking the $G_{\rm SM}$ down to SU(3)$_C$ and the
electromagnetic U(1)$_{\rm EM}$ only when Higgs condenses. In our model, the IR
fermions in the first and second families are composite of UV fields, while the
third family elementary fermions match between UV and IR. The smallness of the
first and second family fermion masses is explained by the exponential
hierarchy between the cutoff scale and the smooth confinement scale via

all the available clients, the random-selection mechanism can lead to
significant performance degradation on non-IID (independent and identically

essential reason resulting in such performance degradation is the
class-imbalance of the grouped data from randomly selected clients. Based on
our key observation, we design an efficient heterogeneity-aware client sampling
mechanism, i.e., Federated Class-balanced Sampling (Fed-CBS), which can
effectively reduce class-imbalance of the group dataset from the intentionally
selected clients. In particular, we propose a measure of class-imbalance and
then employ homomorphic encryption to derive this measure in a
privacy-preserving way. Based on this measure, we also design a
computation-efficient client sampling strategy, such that the actively selected
clients will generate a more class-balanced grouped dataset with theoretical
guarantees. Extensive experimental results demonstrate Fed-CBS outperforms the
status quo approaches. Furthermore, it achieves comparable or even better
performance than the ideal setting where all the available clients participate

due to the importance of identifying out-of-domain samples in reliability and
safety. Although OOD detection methods have advanced by a great deal, they are
still susceptible to adversarial examples, which is a violation of their
purpose. To mitigate this issue, several defenses have recently been proposed.
Nevertheless, these efforts remained ineffective, as their evaluations are
based on either small perturbation sizes, or weak attacks. In this work, we
re-examine these defenses against an end-to-end PGD attack on in/out data with
larger perturbation sizes, e.g. up to commonly used $\epsilon=8/255$ for the
CIFAR-10 dataset. Surprisingly, almost all of these defenses perform worse than
a random detection under the adversarial setting. Next, we aim to provide a
robust OOD detection method. In an ideal defense, the training should expose
the model to almost all possible adversarial perturbations, which can be
achieved through adversarial training. That is, such training perturbations
should based on both in- and out-of-distribution samples. Therefore, unlike OOD
detection in the standard setting, access to OOD, as well as in-distribution,
samples sounds necessary in the adversarial training setup. These tips lead us
to adopt generative OOD detection methods, such as OpenGAN, as a baseline. We
subsequently propose the Adversarially Trained Discriminator (ATD), which
utilizes a pre-trained robust model to extract robust features, and a generator
model to create OOD samples. Using ATD with CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 as the
in-distribution data, we could significantly outperform all previous methods in
the robust AUROC while maintaining high standard AUROC and classification
accuracy. The code repository is available at https://github.com/rohban-lab/ATD .

architectures that are widely used in image-based detection problems. For a
backbone like MobilenetV1, we obtained an almost 4x speedup at the cost of a

from different types of cataclysmic variable stars (CVs). CVs are
semi-detached, binary star systems where material is transferred from the donor
star (also known as the companion or secondary star) onto the white dwarf
primary. CVs are divided into several sub-classes based on the observed
phenomenology in the optical and X-ray bands, which, in turn, is largely
defined by the magnetic field strength of the accretor. In non-magnetic
systems, a variety of observed behaviours are identified, depending on the
accretion rate: novae, dwarf novae, nova-like variables, symbiotic binaries and
supersoft sources are all examples of non-magnetic CVs. In magnetic systems
(polars and intermediate polars, or AM Her and DQ Her systems, respectively),
the accretion flow is channelled to polar regions, and the observational
appearance is different. X-rays are typically produced through hot or energetic
processes, and in CVs they are formed via shocks (within a boundary layer or
accretion column, or through interactions either internal to the nova ejecta,
or between the ejecta and a stellar wind) or from hydrogen burning (either
steady fusion, or a thermonuclear runaway). All of these different types of
accreting white dwarfs are discussed here, considering both spectral and

remarkably well even with an extreme number of learned parameters. This appears
to contradict traditional statistical wisdom, in which a trade-off between
model complexity and fit to the data is essential. We aim to address this
discrepancy by adopting a convex optimization and sparse recovery perspective.
We consider the training and generalization properties of two-layer ReLU
networks with standard weight decay regularization. Under certain regularity
assumptions on the data, we show that ReLU networks with an arbitrary number of

the recovery of the sparsest linear model in compressed sensing. For ReLU
networks and their variants with skip connections or normalization layers, we
present isometry conditions that ensure the exact recovery of planted neurons.
For randomly generated data, we show the existence of a phase transition in
recovering planted neural network models, which is easy to describe: whenever
the ratio between the number of samples and the dimension exceeds a numerical
threshold, the recovery succeeds with high probability; otherwise, it fails
with high probability. Surprisingly, ReLU networks learn simple and sparse
models that generalize well even when the labels are noisy . The phase
transition phenomenon is confirmed through numerical experiments.

questions: (1) Is the linguistic modality also vulnerable to poisoning attacks?
and (2) Which modality is most vulnerable? To answer the two questions, we
propose three types of poisoning attacks against multimodal models. Extensive
evaluations on different datasets and model architectures show that all three
attacks can achieve significant attack performance while maintaining model
utility in both visual and linguistic modalities. Furthermore, we observe that

empirically show that both defenses can significantly reduce the attack

bipartite qudits with positive partial transposition (PPT) and their properties

exists that is hard to detect and called bound entanglement due to the fact
that such entangled states cannot be used for entanglement distillation. Up to
this date, no efficient solution is known to differentiate bound entangled from
separable states. We address and compare this problem named separability
problem for a family of bipartite Bell diagonal qudits with special algebraic
and geometric structures and applications in quantum information processing
tasks in different dimensions. Extending analytical and numerical methods and
results for Bell diagonal qutrits ($d=3$), we successfully classify more than
$75\%$ of representative Bell diagonal PPT states for $d=4$. Via those
representative states we are able to estimate the volumes of separable and
bound entangled states among PPT ququarts ($d=4$). We find that at least
$75.7\%$ of all PPT states are separable, $1.7\%$ bound entangled and for
$22.6\%$ it remains unclear whether they are separable or bound entangled.
Comparing the structure of bound entangled states and their detectors, we find
considerable differences in the detection capabilities for different dimensions

separable and bound entangled Bell diagonal states in both dimensions,
qualitative observations are made that allow to better distinguish bound

  Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine learning models (mainly neural networks) are used more and more in
real life. Users feed their data to the model for training. But these processes
are often one-way. Once trained, the model remembers the data. Even when data
is removed from the dataset, the effects of these data persist in the model.
With more and more laws and regulations around the world protecting data
privacy, it becomes even more important to make models forget this data
completely through machine unlearning.
  This paper adopts the projection residual method based on Newton iteration
method. The main purpose is to implement machine unlearning tasks in the
context of linear regression models and neural network models. This method
mainly uses the iterative weighting method to completely forget the data and
its corresponding influence, and its computational cost is linear in the
feature dimension of the data. This method can improve the current machine
learning method. At the same time, it is independent of the size of the
training set. Results were evaluated by feature injection testing (FIT).
Experiments show that this method is more thorough in deleting data, which is
close to model retraining.

explained the effectiveness of the skip connection mechanism from different

Markov chain is preferred as it always maps the input data to the target domain
in a better way. However, while a model is explained as a Markov chain, it is
not guaranteed to be optimized following an efficient Markov chain by existing
SGD-based optimizers which are prone to get trapped in local optimal points. In
order to towards a more efficient Markov chain, we propose a simple routine of
penal connection to make any residual-like model become a learnable Markov
chain. Aside from that, the penal connection can also be viewed as a particular
model regularization and can be easily implemented with one line of code in the
most popular deep learning frameworks~\footnote{Source code:

learning transferable spatiotemporal representations in recent years. Despite
some progress, existing methods are mostly limited to highly curated datasets

argue that it is due to the fact that they only capture pixel-level knowledge
rather than spatiotemporal semantics, which hinders further progress in video
understanding. Inspired by the great success of image-text pre-training (e.g.,
CLIP), we take the first step to exploit language semantics to boost
transferable spatiotemporal representation learning. We introduce a new pretext
task, Turning to Video for Transcript Sorting (TVTS), which sorts shuffled ASR

descriptive captions and learn purely from video, i.e., leveraging the natural
transcribed speech knowledge to provide noisy but useful semantics over time.
Our method enforces the vision model to contextualize what is happening over
time so that it can re-organize the narrative transcripts, and can seamlessly
apply to large-scale uncurated video data in the real world. Our method
demonstrates strong out-of-the-box spatiotemporal representations on diverse

  Learning Algorithm",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) has recently emerged as a popular method
in recommendation systems (RS), closing the gap between metric learning and
Collaborative Filtering. Following the convention of RS, existing methods
exploit unique user representation in their model design. This paper focuses on
a challenging scenario where a user has multiple categories of interests. Under
this setting, we argue that the unique user representation might induce
preference bias, especially when the item category distribution is imbalanced.
To address this issue, we propose a novel method called
\textit{Diversity-Promoting Collaborative Metric Learning} (DPCML), with the
hope of considering the commonly ignored minority interest of the user. The key
idea behind DPCML is to include a multiple set of representations for each user
in the system. Based on this embedding paradigm, user preference toward an item
is aggregated from different embeddings by taking the minimum item-user
distance among the user embedding set. Furthermore, we observe that the
diversity of the embeddings for the same user also plays an essential role in
the model. To this end, we propose a \textit{diversity control regularization}
term to accommodate the multi-vector representation strategy better.
Theoretically, we show that DPCML could generalize well to unseen test data by
tackling the challenge of the annoying operation that comes from the minimum
value. Experiments over a range of benchmark datasets speak to the efficacy of
DPCML.

the vacuum on the surface of electride crystal. An extremely high electron
density and its weak hybridisation with buried atomic orbitals evidence the
quantum and pure nature of electrons, that exhibit a polarized liquid phase as

more directly, realizing the Terrestrial Reference Frame (TRF) with an accuracy
of 1mm and a long-term stability of 0.1mm/year are relevant for many scientific
and societal endeavors. The knowledge of the TRF is fundamental for Earth and
navigation sciences. For instance, quantifying sea level change strongly
depends on an accurate determination of the geocenter motion but also of the
positions of continental and island reference stations, as well as the ground
stations of tracking networks. Also, numerous applications in geophysics
require absolute millimeter precision from the reference frame, as for example
monitoring tectonic motion or crustal deformation for predicting natural
hazards. The TRF accuracy to be achieved represents the consensus of various
authorities which has enunciated geodesy requirements for Earth sciences.
  Today we are still far from these ambitious accuracy and stability goals for
the realization of the TRF. However, a combination and co-location of all four
space geodetic techniques on one satellite platform can significantly
contribute to achieving these goals. This is the purpose of the GENESIS
mission, proposed as a component of the FutureNAV program of the European Space
Agency. The GENESIS platform will be a dynamic space geodetic observatory
carrying all the geodetic instruments referenced to one another through
carefully calibrated space ties. The co-location of the techniques in space
will solve the inconsistencies and biases between the different geodetic
techniques in order to reach the TRF accuracy and stability goals endorsed by
the various international authorities and the scientific community. The purpose
of this white paper is to review the state-of-the-art and explain the benefits
of the GENESIS mission in Earth sciences, navigation sciences and metrology.

bidirectional search, i.e., performing a forward search from the start and a
backward search from the destination until a common vertex on a shortest path
is found. In practice, this has a tremendous impact on the performance on some
real-world networks, while it only seems to save a constant factor on other
types of networks. Even though finding shortest paths is a ubiquitous problem,
there are only few studies attempting to understand the apparently asymptotic
speedups on some networks, using average case analysis on certain models for
real-world networks.
  In this paper we give a new perspective on this, by analyzing deterministic
properties that permit theoretical analysis and that can easily be checked on
any particular instance. We prove that these parameters imply sublinear running
time for the bidirectional breadth-first search in several regimes, some of
which are tight. Moreover, we perform experiments on a large set of real-world
networks showing that our parameters capture the concept of practical running

derived from beam tracing and the reciprocity theorem, to shed light on
mismatch attenuation. This attenuation of the backscattered signal occurs when
the wavevector of the probe beam's electric field is not in the plane
perpendicular to the magnetic field. Correcting for this effect is important
for determining the amplitude of the actual density fluctuations. Previous
preliminary comparisons between the model and Mega-Ampere Spherical Tokamak
(MAST) plasmas were promising. In this work, we quantitatively account for this
effect on DIII-D, a conventional tokamak. We compare the predicted and measured
mismatch attenuation in various DIII-D, MAST, and MAST-U plasmas, showing that
the beam model is applicable in a wide variety of situations. Finally, we
performed a preliminary parameter sweep and found that the mismatch tolerance
can be improved by optimising the probe beam's width and curvature at launch.

of $N$ agents over a sequence of $T$ rounds and focus on improving their
performance using predictions. In the basic model, a public good arrives in
each round, the algorithm learns every agent's value for the good, and must
irrevocably decide the amount of investment in the good without exceeding a
total budget of $B$ across all rounds. The algorithm can utilize (potentially
inaccurate) predictions of each agent's total value for all the goods to
arrive. We measure the performance of the algorithm using a proportional
fairness objective, which informally demands that every group of agents be
rewarded in proportion to its size and the cohesiveness of its preferences.
  In the special case of binary agent preferences and a unit budget, we show
that $O(\log N)$ proportional fairness can be achieved without using any
predictions, and that this is optimal even if perfectly accurate predictions
were available. However, for general preferences and budget no algorithm can
achieve better than $\Theta(T/B)$ proportional fairness without predictions. We
show that algorithms with (reasonably accurate) predictions can do much better,
achieving $\Theta(\log (T/B))$ proportional fairness. We also extend this
result to a general model in which a batch of $L$ public goods arrive in each
round and achieve $O(\log (\min(N,L) \cdot T/B))$ proportional fairness. Our
exact bounds are parametrized as a function of the error in the predictions and
the performance degrades gracefully with increasing errors.

this work, we investigate how the cost of data annotation ultimately impacts
the CAD model performance on classification and segmentation of chest

policies in ways that do not preserve algorithm guarantees, which defeats the
purpose of formal robustness requirements. In this work we study a notion of
robustness in partially observable MDPs where state observations are perturbed
by a noise-induced stochastic kernel. We characterise the set of policies that
are maximally robust by analysing how the policies are altered by this kernel.
We then establish a connection between such robust policies and certain
properties of the noise kernel, as well as with structural properties of the
underlying MDPs, constructing sufficient conditions for policy robustness. We
use these notions to propose a robustness-inducing scheme, applicable to any
policy gradient algorithm, to formally trade off the reward achieved by a
policy with its robustness level through lexicographic optimisation, which
preserves convergence properties of the original algorithm. We test the the
proposed approach through numerical experiments on safety-critical RL

provide poor empirical coverage of missing data, with underestimation and
overconfident imputations, particularly for more extreme missing data values.
To overcome this, we employ $\beta$-VAEs, which viewed from a generalized Bayes

location of sound is basic information associated with the acoustic source.
Apart from sound recognition, whether the acoustic sources can be localized
largely affects the capability and quality of the smart device's interactive
functions. In this work, we study the problem of concurrently localizing
multiple acoustic sources with a smart device (e.g., a smart speaker like
Amazon Alexa). The existing approaches either can only localize a single
source, or require deploying a distributed network of microphone arrays to
function. Our proposal called Symphony is the first approach to tackle the
above problem with a single microphone array. The insight behind Symphony is
that the geometric layout of microphones on the array determines the unique
relationship among signals from the same source along the same arriving path,
while the source's location determines the DoAs (direction-of-arrival) of
signals along different arriving paths. Symphony therefore includes a
geometry-based filtering module to distinguish signals from different sources
along different paths and a coherence-based module to identify signals from the
same source. We implement Symphony with different types of commercial
off-the-shelf microphone arrays and evaluate its performance under different
settings. The results show that Symphony has a median localization error of
0.694m, which is 68% less than that of the state-of-the-art approach.

several reasons to go beyond the current model of gravitation and search for
new fundamental physics. This means looking for new, so far undetected, fields.
Scalars are the easiest fields to consider and they are ubiquitous in both
extensions of the Standard Model and in alternative theories of gravity. That
is why a lot of attention has been drawn towards the investigation of
scalar-tensor theories, where gravity is described by both the metric tensor
and a scalar field.
  A particularly interesting phenomenon that has recently gained increasing
interest is spontaneous scalarization. In gravity theories that exhibit this
mechanism, astrophysical objects are identical to their general relativistic
counterpart until they reach a specific threshold, usually either in
compactness, curvature or, as recently shown, in spin. Beyond this threshold,
they acquire a nontrivial scalar configuration, which also affects their
structure.
  In this thesis, we focus on the study of this mechanism in generalized
scalar-tensor theories. We identify a minimal action that contains all of the
terms that can potentially trigger spontaneous scalarization. We first focus on
the onset of scalarization in this specific theory and determine the relevant
thresholds in terms of the contributing coupling constants and the properties
of the compact object. Finally, we study the effect of this model on the
properties of both scalarized black holes and neutron stars, such as affecting
their domain of existence or the amount of scalar charge they carry.

challenging limitations including saturation effects and temporal pulse

post-compression of 150 fs pulses and up to 250 uJ pulse energy from an
Ytterbium (Yb) fiber laser down to sub-20 fs. Dispersion-engineered dielectric
cavity mirrors are used to achieve nonlinear spectral broadening dominated by
self-phase-modulation over large compression factors and bandwidths at 98%
throughput. Our method opens a route towards single-stage post-compression of
Yb lasers into the few-cycle regime.

We utilize the Linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model to simulate the

hadronization model to investigate the non-perturbative transition of quarks
and gluons into final hadrons in heavy-ion collisions. Including hadronization
effect, we can well describe $Z^0/\gamma$+hadrons correlations and
$Z^0/\gamma$-tagged jet substructures in both p+p and Pb+Pb collisions
simultaneously. Medium modification on jet profile and jet fragmentation
functions indicate that particles carrying a large fraction of the jet momentum
are generally closely aligned with the jet axis, whereas low-momentum particles
are observed to have a much broader angular distribution relative to jet axis
in Pb+Pb collisions due to jet-medium interactions. In particular, we find that
$Z^0/\gamma$-tagged hadron correlations are sensitive to the soft particles
from the dense medium and medium response, while jet-substructures show weak
dependence on those soft hadrons with only a fraction of them falling inside
the jet area.

achieving safe landing as the cats has been increasingly investigated. Unlike
imposing the burden on landing control, we approach to safe landing of falling
quadruped robots by effective flight phase control. Different from existing
work like swinging legs and attaching reaction wheels or simple tails, we
propose to deploy a 3-DoF morphable inertial tail on a medium-size quadruped
robot. In the flight phase, the tail with its maximum length can self-right the
body orientation in 3D effectively; before touch-down, the tail length can be
retracted to about 1/4 of its maximum for impressing the tail's side-effect on
landing. To enable aerial reorientation for safe landing in the quadruped
robots, we design a control architecture, which has been verified in a
high-fidelity physics simulation environment with different initial conditions.
Experimental results on a customized flight-phase test platform with comparable
inertial properties are provided and show the tail's effectiveness on 3D body
reorientation and its fast retractability before touch-down. An initial falling
quadruped robot experiment is shown, where the robot Unitree A1 with the 3-DoF
tail can land safely subject to non-negligible initial body angles.

that, depending only on the physical processes to which the water patch is

potential benefits of massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. In
frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO systems, the base station (BS)
relies on sustained and accurate CSI feedback from the users. However, due to
the large number of antennas and users being served in massive MIMO systems,
feedback overhead can become a bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a
model-driven deep learning method for CSI feedback, called learnable
optimization and regularization algorithm (LORA). Instead of using l1-norm as
the regularization term, a learnable regularization module is introduced in
LORA to automatically adapt to the characteristics of CSI. We unfold the
conventional iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA) to a neural
network and learn both the optimization process and regularization term by
end-toend training. We show that LORA improves the CSI feedback accuracy and
speed. Besides, a novel learnable quantization method and the corresponding
training scheme are proposed, and it is shown that LORA can operate
successfully at different bit rates, providing flexibility in terms of the CSI
feedback overhead. Various realistic scenarios are considered to demonstrate
the effectiveness and robustness of LORA through numerical simulations.

This decomposition enables us to surface two potential sources of overfitting,

quantized version of the information source of interest is considered. The task
is modeled by the minimization problem of a general goal function $f(x;g)$ for
which the decision $x$ has to be taken from a quantized version of the
parameters $g$. This problem is relevant in many applications e.g., for radio
resource allocation (RA), high spectral efficiency communications, controlled
systems, or data clustering in the smart grid. By resorting to high resolution
(HR) analysis, it is shown how to design a quantizer that minimizes the gap
between the minimum of $f$ (which would be reached by knowing $g$ perfectly)
and what is effectively reached with a quantized $g$. The conducted formal
analysis both provides quantization strategies in the HR regime and insights
for the general regime and allows a practical algorithm to be designed. The
analysis also allows one to provide some elements to the new and fundamental
problem of the relationship between the goal function regularity properties and
the hardness to quantize its parameters. The derived results are discussed and
supported by a rich numerical performance analysis in which known RA goal
functions are studied and allows one to exhibit very significant improvements

with the radio range, thereby necessitating the cooperation between the access
point and the backscatter tags through a feedback loop. Unfortunately, the
low-power nature of backscatter tags limits their ability to demodulate

demodulate feedback signals from a remote access point with moderate power

PHY-layer operations that are important to channel efficiency yet unavailable

(e.g., separating multiple people simultaneously speaking). This is further
complicated by real-world recording conditions (e.g., background noise,
reverberation, etc.). Scarce text annotations impose another constraint,
limiting the ability to scale models. Finally, modeling high-fidelity audio
requires encoding audio at high sampling rate, leading to extremely long

$\mathrm{ind}_{ZN}^G(\omega_\pi \theta)$, where $\omega_\pi$ is the central

Whittaker multiplicity at most one for cuspidal representations. Then by a
lifting argument, we recover Rodier's generalization of the Gelfand-Kazhdan
property for $R$-valued $(\theta^{-1}\otimes \theta)$-equivariant distributions

generalization over $R$ of a result for complex representations proved by Chang

wedge cross-section, mutual information, and entanglement negativity and
investigate how a background magnetic field leaves its imprints on the

the magnetic field, we find that the behaviour of these measures depends
nontrivially on the relative orientation of the strip with respect to the

a phase transition at the same critical strip length, the magnitude of which
increases/decreases for parallel/perpendicular orientation of the magnetic
field. The entanglement wedge cross-section similarly displays discontinuous
behaviour each time a phase transition between different entangling surfaces
occurs, while further exhibiting anisotropic features with a magnetic field. We
further find that the magnetic field also introduces substantial changes in the
entanglement measures of the deconfined phase, however, these changes remain
qualitatively similar for all orientations of the magnetic field. We further
study the inequality involving entanglement wedge and mutual information and
find that the former always exceeds half of the latter everywhere in the

causal relations between the modes of a reduced-order model obtained by
applying proper-orthogonal decomposition to high-fidelity-simulation data of

conditional transfer entropy, which is an information-theoretical quantity that
estimates the amount of information contained in the past of one variable about

different phenomena in the flow, with the aim of identifying the modes
responsible for the formation of the main vortical structures. Our approach
unveils that vortex-breaker modes are the most causal modes, in particular,
over higher-order modes, and no significant causal relationships were found for
vortex-generator modes. We validate this technique by determining the causal
relations present in the nine-equation model of near-wall turbulence developed
by Moehlis et al. (New J. Phys, vol. 6, 2004, p. 56), which are in good

modeling the transverse distributions of the total and linearly polarized
intensity, polarization degree, and deviation of the polarization direction
from the local jet axis and by further comparison with observational data. We
consider (i) a helical field with a different twist angle; (ii) a toroidal
field on the jet axis surrounded by a sheath with a longitudinal field. In the
latter scenario, we consider different sheath thickness relative to the spine.
We assumed the sheath velocity is equal to or less than that of the spine. The
relativistic effects have been considered for a general case, under which the
axis and velocity vector of the jet and radial directions do not coincide. Our
simulations reproduce the main features of the observed transverse profiles of
polarization characteristics in parsec-scale AGN jets. The model transverse
distribution shapes of the polarization properties are found to be strongly
influenced by kinematic and geometric parameters of an outflow. We demonstrated
it for three AGNs having different but typical polarization patterns revealed

provide valuable information about the fundamental dynamical properties of the

quantum interference device (SQUID) sensor. We present a tabletop setup using
Optically Pumped Magnetometers (OPMs) in a small magnetic shield, offering a
flexible and accessible alternative and show the agreement between both
measurement systems for two different commercially available nanoparticle
samples. We argue that the OPM setup with high accessibility complements the
SQUID setup with high sensitivity and bandwidth. Furthermore, because of its
excellent sensitivity in the lower frequencies, the OPM tabletop setup is well
suited to monitor aggregation processes where the magnetization dynamics of the
particles tend to slow down, e.g. in biological processes. As a proof of
concept, we show for three different immobilization and clustering processes
the changes in the noise spectrum measured in the tabletop setup: 1) the
aggregation of particles due to the addition of ethanol, 2) the formation of
polymer structures in the sample due to UV exposure, and 3) the cellular uptake
of the particles by THP-1 cells. From our results we conclude that the tabletop

the immobilization and clustering of magnetic nanoparticles over time for

its numerous applications. Nowadays, the state-of-the-art approach consists in
a three-step process. The document is segmented into text lines, which are then
ordered and recognized. However, this three-step approach has many drawbacks.
The three steps are treated independently whereas they are closely related.
Errors accumulate from one step to the other. The ordering step is based on
heuristic rules which prevent its use for documents with a complex layouts or
for heterogeneous documents. The need for additional physical segmentation
annotations for training the segmentation stage is inherent to this approach.
In this thesis, we propose to tackle these issues by performing the handwritten
text recognition of whole document in an end-to-end way. To this aim, we
gradually increase the difficulty of the recognition task, moving from isolated
lines to paragraphs, and then to whole documents. We proposed an approach at
the line level, based on a fully convolutional network, in order to design a
first generic feature extraction step for the handwriting recognition task.
Based on this preliminary work, we studied two different approaches to
recognize handwritten paragraphs. We reached state-of-the-art results at
paragraph level on the RIMES 2011, IAM and READ 2016 datasets and outperformed
the line-level state of the art on these datasets. We finally proposed the
first end-to-end approach dedicated to the recognition of both text and layout,
at document level. Characters and layout tokens are sequentially predicted
following a learned reading order. We proposed two new metrics we used to
evaluate this task on the RIMES 2009 and READ 2016 dataset, at page level and
double-page level.

non-Hermitian equations of motion, which are solved by an eigenfunction
expansion in terms of a biorthogonal basis set. Our calculations show that the
polymer conformations are independent of activity. On the contrary, tangential
propulsion strongly impacts the polymer dynamics and yields an active ballistic
regime as well as activity-enhanced long-time diffusion, regimes which are both
absent in passive systems. The polar forces imply a coupling of modes in the
eigenfunction representation, in particular with the translational mode, with a
respective strong influence on the polymer dynamics. The total polymer
mean-square displacement on scales smaller than their radius of gyration is
determined by the active internal dynamics rather than the collective
center-of-mass motion, in contrast to active Brownian polymers, reflecting the
distinct difference in the propulsion mechanism.

software. A microbenchmark repeatedly executes a small chunk of code while
collecting measurements related to its performance. Due to Java Virtual Machine
optimizations, microbenchmarks are usually subject to severe performance
fluctuations in the first phase of their execution (also known as warmup). For
this reason, software developers typically discard measurements of this phase
and focus their analysis when benchmarks reach a steady state of performance.
Developers estimate the end of the warmup phase based on their expertise, and
configure their benchmarks accordingly. Unfortunately, this approach is based
on two strong assumptions: (i) benchmarks always reach a steady state of
performance and (ii) developers accurately estimate warmup. In this paper, we
show that Java microbenchmarks do not always reach a steady state, and often
developers fail to accurately estimate the end of the warmup phase. We found
that a considerable portion of studied benchmarks do not hit the steady state,
and warmup estimates provided by software developers are often inaccurate (with
a large error). This has significant implications both in terms of results
quality and time-effort. Furthermore, we found that dynamic reconfiguration
significantly improves warmup estimation accuracy, but still it induces
suboptimal warmup estimates and relevant side-effects. We envision this paper

implemented in a 1-Tx and 1-Rx antenna system and explained using transmission
line-based theory. Further, it is extended to 1-Tx and 2-Rx configurations.
Here the proposed full-duplex antenna system is designed at $5.9$ GHz
($5.855-5.925$ GHz, IEEE 802.11p / WAVE technology) intelligent transportation
system (ITS) application band using a microstrip patch configuration. The
individual antenna exhibits an impedance bandwidth of $93$ MHz ($5.850-5.944$

than $20$ dB in the broad side direction. The proposed FD configuration
exhibits $|S_{ij}|$ of less than $-50$ dB over the complete operating band and
$\approx -90$ dB is achieved at the operating frequency between the Tx and Rx.
Similarly, $|S_{ij}|$ of less the $-30$ dB is achieved between 2-Rx antennas
for a three-element FD configuration. The design procedure of the proposed FD
configuration is explained and verified using fabrication and measurement. An
experimental demonstration of the self-interference channel and its suppression

mask by Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC). Overall, two versions of SmoothGrad
topped the fidelity and ROC rankings, whereas both Integrated Gradients and
SmoothGrad excelled in DSC evaluation. Interestingly, there was a critical
discrepancy between model-centric (fidelity) and human-centric (ROC and DSC)
evaluation. Expert expectation and intuition embedded in segmentation maps does
not necessarily align with how the model arrived at its prediction.
Understanding this difference in interpretability would help harnessing the

ROS-based robotics testbed to emulate two scenarios: free-floating satellite
motion and free-floating interaction (collision). Mock-ups of two satellites
are mounted at the robots' end-effectors. Forces acting on the mock-ups are
measured through an in-built F/T sensor on each robotic arm. During the tests,
the relative motion of the mock-ups is expressed with respect to a moving
observer rotating at a fixed angular velocity in a circular orbit rather than
their motion in the inertial frame. The ODS incorporates the force and torque

challenge. This study explores how the colloidal fraction of common MPs behave
at aqueous interfaces of liquid crystal (LC) films. We observed polyethylene
(PE) and polystyrene (PS) microparticles to be captured at the LC interface and
exhibit distinct two-dimensional aggregation patterns. The addition of low
concentrations of surfactant (sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)) was found to further
amplify the differences in PS/PE aggregation patterns, with PS changing from a
linear chain-like morphology to a singly dispersed state with increasing SDS
concentration and PE forming dense clusters at all SDS concentrations.
Statistical characterization of assembly patterns using fractal geometric
theory-based machine learning and a deep learning image recognition model
yielded highly accurate classification of PE vs PS (>99%). Additionally, by
performing feature importance analysis on our deep learning model, dense,
multi-branched assemblies were confirmed to be unique features of PE relative
to PS. To obtain additional insight into the origin of these key features, we
performed microscopic characterization of LC ordering at the microparticle
surfaces. These observations led us to predict that both microparticle types
should generate LC-mediated interactions (due to elastic strain) with a dipolar
symmetry, a prediction consistent with the observed interfacial organization of
PS but not PE. We conclude that the non-equilibrium organization of the PE
microparticles arises from their polycrystalline nature, which leads to rough
particle surfaces and weakened LC elastic interactions and enhanced capillary
forces. Overall, our results highlight the potential utility of LC interfaces
for surface-sensitive characterization of colloidal MPs.

framework of first- and second-order semiclassical theory. Herein, we
generalize the semiclassical theory for Bloch electrons under the uniform

Moreover, with symmetry analysis, we find that the third-order IAHE, as the
leading contribution, is supported by 15 time-reversal broken 3D magnetic point

materials. Guided by the symmetry arguments, a two-band model is chosen to
demonstrate the generalized theory. Furthermore, the generalized third-order

that it can also be employed to explore the IAHE in realistic AFM materials, by

hopping integrals between phosphorus donors in silicon using known orbital wave
functions. While the two-donor problem can be solved directly, the knowledge of
hoppings for various pairs of orbitals is essential for constructing
multi-orbital Hubbard models for chains and arrays of donors. To assure
applicability to long-range potentials, we rederive Bardeen's formula for the
matrix element without assuming non-overlapping potentials. Moreover, we find a
correction to the original expression allowing us to use it at short distances.
We also show that accurate calculation of the lowest donor-pair eigenstates is
possible based on these tunnel couplings, and we characterize the obtained
states. The results are in satisfactory quantitative agreement with those
obtained with the standard H\""uckel tight-binding method. The calculation
relies solely on the wave functions in the barrier region and does not
explicitly involve donor or lattice potentials, which has practical advantages.
We find that neglecting the central correction potential in the standard method
may lead to qualitatively incorrect results, while its explicit inclusion
raises severe numerical problems, as it is contained in a tiny volume. In
contrast, using wave functions obtained with this correction in the proposed
method does not raise such issues. Nominally, the computational cost of the
method is to calculate a double integral along the plane that separates donors.
For donor separation in directions where valley interference leads to
oscillatory behavior, additional averaging over the position of the integration
plane is needed. Despite this, the presented approach offers a competitive
computational cost as compared to the standard one. This work may be regarded
as a benchmark of a promising method for calculating hopping integrals in
lattice models.

terms of arousal and valence, annotated datasets are needed. However, as
different people perceive others' emotional expressions differently, their
annotations are per se subjective. For this, annotations are typically
collected from multiple annotators and averaged to obtain ground-truth labels.
However, when exclusively trained on this averaged ground-truth, the trained
network is agnostic to the inherent subjectivity in emotional expressions. In
this work, we therefore propose an end-to-end Bayesian neural network capable
of being trained on a distribution of labels to also capture the
subjectivity-based label uncertainty. Instead of a Gaussian, we model the label
distribution using Student's t-distribution, which also accounts for the number
of annotations. We derive the corresponding Kullback-Leibler divergence loss
and use it to train an estimator for the distribution of labels, from which the
mean and uncertainty can be inferred. We validate the proposed method using two
in-the-wild datasets. We show that the proposed t-distribution based approach
achieves state-of-the-art uncertainty modeling results in speech emotion

Furthermore, analyses reveal that the advantage of a t-distribution over a

super-Schwarzian modes which is dual to the exchange of 2D supergravity modes.
We compute corrections to four-point functions for superconformal primaries and
analyse the behaviour of out-of-time-ordered correlators. In particular,
four-point functions of two pairs of primaries with mutually vanishing
two-point functions are considered. By decomposing the corresponding
supermultiplet into its components, we find different Lyapunov exponents. The
value of the Lyapunov exponents depends on whether the correction is due to
graviton, gravitini or graviphoton exchange. If mutual two-point functions do

open for materials with refractive index of at least 1.9. We present here a
quasiperiodic 3D structure consisting of multiple overlapping gratings with a
homogeneous distribution of Bragg peaks on a sphere in reciprocal space, which
allows efficient suppression of emission. Recently we have presented the
theoretical model, considering interaction with the neighbouring gratings only,
that estimates a finite CPBG for arbitrarily small refractive indices and thus
complete emission suppression in infinite structures. However, numerical
simulations demonstrate a finite leakage of power from emitter not predicted by
the model. Still the simulations show -10 dB suppression in 3D structures with
optimised number of gratings. Astonishingly, as we show here, this limit is
almost independent of the refractive index contrast. Also, the structures with
a defined number of gratings show maximal suppression at certain refractive
indices, losing the suppression even at higher refractive indices. The -10 dB

matching layer in neural networks. Entropy-regularized OT can be computed using
the Sinkhorn algorithm but it leads to fully-dense transportation plans,
meaning that all sources are (fractionally) matched with all targets. To
address this issue, several works have investigated quadratic regularization
instead. This regularization preserves sparsity and leads to unconstrained and
smooth (semi) dual objectives, that can be solved with off-the-shelf gradient
methods. Unfortunately, quadratic regularization does not give direct control
over the cardinality (number of nonzeros) of the transportation plan. We
propose in this paper a new approach for OT with explicit cardinality
constraints on the transportation plan. Our work is motivated by an application
to sparse mixture of experts, where OT can be used to match input tokens such
as image patches with expert models such as neural networks. Cardinality
constraints ensure that at most $k$ tokens are matched with an expert, which is
crucial for computational performance reasons. Despite the nonconvexity of
cardinality constraints, we show that the corresponding (semi) dual problems
are tractable and can be solved with first-order gradient methods. Our method
can be thought as a middle ground between unregularized OT (recovered in the
limit case $k=1$) and quadratically-regularized OT (recovered when $k$ is large
enough). The smoothness of the objectives increases as $k$ increases, giving
rise to a trade-off between convergence speed and sparsity of the optimal plan.

around the Spiderweb galaxy at z=2.16 and of its nuclear emission, based on a
deep (700 ks) Chandra observation. We characterize the nuclear emission and
computed the contamination in the surrounding regions due to the wings of the
instrument PSF. Then, we quantified the extended emission within 12"". We find
that the Spiderweb galaxy hosts a mildly absorbed quasar, with modest yet
significant variability on a timescale of ~1 year. We find that the emission in
the jet regions is well described by a power law with Gamma~2-2.5, and it is
consistent with IC upscattering of the CMB photons by the relativistic
electrons. We also find a roughly symmetric, diffuse emission within a radius
of ~100 kpc. This emission is consistent with thermal bremsstrahlung from a hot
ICM with a temperature of kT=2.0_{-0.4}^{+0.7} keV, and a metallicity of
Z<1.6Z_sun. The average electron density within 100 kpc is
n_e=(1.51+-0.24+-0.14)E-2 cm^{-3}, corresponding to an upper limit for the
total ICM mass of <=(1.76+-0.30+-0.17)E+12 M_sun (where error bars are 1 sigma
statistical and systematic, respectively). If we apply hydrostatic equilibrium
to the ICM, we measure a total gravitational mass M(<100
kpc)=(1.5^{+0.5}_{-0.3})E+13 M_sun and, extrapolating at larger radii, we
estimate a total mass M_{500}=(3.2^{+1.1}_{-0.6})E+13 M_sun within a radius of
r_{500}=(220+-30) kpc. We conclude that the Spiderweb protocluster shows
significant diffuse emission within a radius of 12 arcsec, whose major
contribution is provided by IC scattering associated with the radio jets.
Outside the jet regions, we also identified thermal emission within a radius of
~100 kpc, revealing the presence of hot, diffuse baryons that may represent the

(PQSM). Specifically, we first propose a projection-based point cloud saliency
map generation method, in which depth information is introduced to better
reflect the geometric characteristics of point clouds. Then, we construct point
cloud local neighborhoods to derive three structural descriptors to indicate
the geometry, color and saliency discrepancies. Finally, a saliency-based
pooling strategy is proposed to generate the final quality score. Extensive
experiments are performed on four independent PCQA databases. The results
demonstrate that the proposed PQSM shows competitive performances compared to
multiple state-of-the-art PCQA metrics.

an open quantum system by means of repeated interactions between the system and

open quantum systems, which are composed of several subsystems. In particular,
we are interested in models that are based on elementary collisions between the
subsystems and the ancillas, and that simulate global and/or local Markovian
master equations in the limit of infinitesimal timestep. After discussing the
mathematical details of the derivation of a generic collision-based master
equation, we provide the general ideas at the basis of the collision models for
multipartite systems, we discuss their strengths and limitations, and we show
how they may be simulated on a quantum computer. Moreover, we analyze some
properties of a collision model based on entangled ancillas, derive the master
equation it generates for small timesteps, and prove that the coefficients of
this master equation are subject to a constraint that limits their generality.
Finally, we present an example of this collision model with two bosonic
ancillas entangled in a two-mode squeezed thermal state.

that the relaxation of plasmon excitations formed in deposited metal clusters

the interaction with low-energy secondary electrons emitted from a substrate.
The characteristic occurrence times for plasmon-induced energy relaxation
events are several orders of magnitude shorter than those for the momentum
transfer events by energetic primary electrons to atoms of the cluster. The
theoretical analysis is supported by the results of molecular dynamics

been extensively investigated. This work focuses on improving the robustness of

propose an effective and efficient method to learn robust discrete speech

optimizing the model using an iterative pseudo-labeling scheme. Our method
significantly improves over the evaluated baselines when considering encoding

  2023 (oral - top 5%)",,,"cs.LG cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Many Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) perform poorly compared to simple
heuristics on Link Prediction (LP) tasks. This is due to limitations in
expressive power such as the inability to count triangles (the backbone of most
LP heuristics) and because they can not distinguish automorphic nodes (those
having identical structural roles). Both expressiveness issues can be
alleviated by learning link (rather than node) representations and
incorporating structural features such as triangle counts. Since explicit link
representations are often prohibitively expensive, recent works resorted to
subgraph-based methods, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance for
LP, but suffer from poor efficiency due to high levels of redundancy between
subgraphs. We analyze the components of subgraph GNN (SGNN) methods for link
prediction. Based on our analysis, we propose a novel full-graph GNN called
ELPH (Efficient Link Prediction with Hashing) that passes subgraph sketches as
messages to approximate the key components of SGNNs without explicit subgraph
construction. ELPH is provably more expressive than Message Passing GNNs
(MPNNs). It outperforms existing SGNN models on many standard LP benchmarks
while being orders of magnitude faster. However, it shares the common GNN
limitation that it is only efficient when the dataset fits in GPU memory.
Accordingly, we develop a highly scalable model, called BUDDY, which uses
feature precomputation to circumvent this limitation without sacrificing
predictive performance. Our experiments show that BUDDY also outperforms SGNNs
on standard LP benchmarks while being highly scalable and faster than ELPH.

systems at multiple scales, but their detection remains challenging in
practice. Community detection methods often define communities as dense
subgraphs, or subgraphs with few connections in-between, via concepts such as
the cut, conductance, or modularity. Here we consider another perspective built
on the notion of local dominance, where low-degree nodes are assigned to the
basin of influence of high-degree nodes, and design an efficient algorithm
based on local information. Local dominance gives rises to community centers,
and uncovers local hierarchies in the network. Community centers have a larger
degree than their neighbors and are sufficiently distant from other centers.
The strength of our framework is demonstrated on synthesized and empirical
networks with ground-truth community labels. The notion of local dominance and
the associated asymmetric relations between nodes are not restricted to
community detection, and can be utilised in clustering problems, as we
illustrate on networks derived from vector data.

disruption. We wrote a one-dimensional code that models the growth and porosity
evolution of grains as they drift to study their final outcome when the two

Fundamental
studies on the annular configuration of airblast atomizers are difficult to
realize. For this reason, researchers focused on planar configurations. In this
regard, the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) developed a test rig to
conduct experimental activities, conforming a large database with results for
different conditions. Such data allow validation of two-phase flow calculations
concerning primary atomization on these devices. The present investigation
proposes a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) on the KIT planar configuration
through the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method within the PARIS code. The novelty
compared to DNS reported in the literature resides in the use of a boundary
condition that accounts not only for the gas inflow turbulence but also for the
spatio-temporal evolution of the liquid film thickness at the DNS inlet and its
effect on turbulence. The proposed methodology requires computing precursor
single-phase and two-phase flow Large-Eddy Simulations. Results are compared to
DNS that only account for a constant (both timewise and spanwise) liquid film
thickness at the domain inlet, validating the workflow. The proposed
methodology improves the qualitative description of the breakup mechanism, as
its different stages (liquid accumulation behind the prefilmer edge, bag
formation, bag breakup, ligament formation and ligament breakup) coexist
spanwise for a given temporal snapshot. This implies more continuous
atomization than the one predicted by the constant film thickness case, which
showed the same breakup stage to be present along the prefilmer span for a
given instant and led to a more discretized set of atomization events. The
proposed workflow allows quantifying the influence of the liquid film flow
evolution above the prefilmer on primary breakup frequency and atomization
features.

AI systems. Learning these steps from instructional videos involves two
subproblems: (i) identifying the temporal boundary of sequentially occurring
segments and (ii) summarizing these steps in natural language. We refer to this
task as Procedure Segmentation and Summarization (PSS). In this paper, we take
a closer look at PSS and propose three fundamental improvements over current
methods. The segmentation task is critical, as generating a correct summary
requires each step of the procedure to be correctly identified. However,
current segmentation metrics often overestimate the segmentation quality
because they do not consider the temporal order of segments. In our first
contribution, we propose a new segmentation metric that takes into account the
order of segments, giving a more reliable measure of the accuracy of a given
predicted segmentation. Current PSS methods are typically trained by proposing
segments, matching them with the ground truth and computing a loss. However,
much like segmentation metrics, existing matching algorithms do not consider
the temporal order of the mapping between candidate segments and the ground
truth. In our second contribution, we propose a matching algorithm that
constrains the temporal order of segment mapping, and is also differentiable.
Lastly, we introduce multi-modal feature training for PSS, which further
improves segmentation. We evaluate our approach on two instructional video
datasets (YouCook2 and Tasty) and observe an improvement over the
state-of-the-art of $\sim7\%$ and $\sim2.5\%$ for procedure segmentation and
summarization, respectively.

performance of neural networks. For decentralized learning, a straightforward
approach using momentum acceleration is Distributed SGD (DSGD) with momentum
acceleration (DSGDm). However, DSGDm performs worse than DSGD when the data
distributions are statistically heterogeneous. Recently, several studies have
addressed this issue and proposed methods with momentum acceleration that are
more robust to data heterogeneity than DSGDm, although their convergence rates
remain dependent on data heterogeneity and decrease when the data distributions
are heterogeneous. In this study, we propose Momentum Tracking, which is a
method with momentum acceleration whose convergence rate is proven to be
independent of data heterogeneity. More specifically, we analyze the
convergence rate of Momentum Tracking in the standard deep learning setting,
where the objective function is non-convex and the stochastic gradient is used.
Then, we identify that it is independent of data heterogeneity for any momentum
coefficient $\beta\in [0, 1)$. Through image classification tasks, we
demonstrate that Momentum Tracking is more robust to data heterogeneity than
the existing decentralized learning methods with momentum acceleration and can
consistently outperform these existing methods when the data distributions are

large-scale problems. However, as we show here, an independent learning of the
ensemble components can lead to suboptimal diversity. Hence, we study the
effect of instead using MISELBO as an objective function for learning mixtures,
and we propose the first ever mixture of variational approximations for a
normalizing flow-based hierarchical variational autoencoder (VAE) with
VampPrior and a PixelCNN decoder network. Two major insights led to the
construction of this novel composite model. First, mixture models have
potential to be off-the-shelf tools for practitioners to obtain more flexible
posterior approximations in VAEs. Therefore, we make them more accessible by
demonstrating how to apply them to four popular architectures. Second, the
mixture components cooperate in order to cover the target distribution while
trying to maximize their diversity when MISELBO is the objective function. We
explain this cooperative behavior by drawing a novel connection between VI and
adaptive importance sampling. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of the
Mixture VAEs' learned feature representations on both image and single-cell
transcriptome data, and obtain state-of-the-art results among VAE architectures
in terms of negative log-likelihood on the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets.

This paper thoroughly studies the knowledge transferability of pre-trained VLMs

with expressive attributes that are shared between domains, the VLM can carry
the knowledge across domains and improve its generalization. This mechanism
empowers VLMs to recognize novel objects with fewer or without image samples.
Furthermore, to avoid the laborious manual designing process, we develop three
approaches for automatic generation of medical prompts, which can inject
expert-level medical knowledge and image-specific information into the prompts
for fine-grained grounding. We conduct extensive experiments on thirteen
different medical datasets across various modalities, showing that our

solution to obtain pre-trained small models without the need for extra
teachers, namely, slimmable networks for contrastive self-supervised learning
(\emph{SlimCLR}). A slimmable network consists of a full network and several
weight-sharing sub-networks, which can be pre-trained once to obtain various
networks, including small ones with low computation costs. However,
interference between weight-sharing networks leads to severe performance
degradation in self-supervised cases, as evidenced by \emph{gradient magnitude
imbalance} and \emph{gradient direction divergence}. The former indicates that
a small proportion of parameters produce dominant gradients during
backpropagation, while the main parameters may not be fully optimized. The
latter shows that the gradient direction is disordered, and the optimization
process is unstable. To address these issues, we introduce three techniques to
make the main parameters produce dominant gradients and sub-networks have
consistent outputs. These techniques include slow start training of
sub-networks, online distillation, and loss re-weighting according to model
sizes. Furthermore, theoretical results are presented to demonstrate that a
single slimmable linear layer is sub-optimal during linear evaluation. Thus a
switchable linear probe layer is applied during linear evaluation. We
instantiate SlimCLR with typical contrastive learning frameworks and achieve
better performance than previous arts with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

operator in question is the $2$-plane transform restricted to directions normal
to the surface, that is \[ \mathcal{T}f(x,\xi) := \iint_{|s|,|t| \leq 1} f(x -

Gressman (that is, the associated affine invariant surface measure does not
vanish) the operator satisfies sharp $L^p \to L^q$ inequalities for $p,q$ up to
the critical point. We also show that the well-curvedness assumption is
necessary to obtain the full range of estimates. The proof relies on two main

We review historical, bottom-up, and top-down approaches to modeling synaptic
plasticity, and we identify computational primitives that can support
low-latency and low-power hardware implementations of spike-based learning
rules. We provide a common definition of a locality principle based on pre- and

we compare the properties of these models within the same framework, and
describe the mixed-signal electronic circuits that implement their computing
primitives, pointing out how these building blocks enable efficient on-chip and
online learning in neuromorphic processing systems.

astronomy. The rich data produced by an international network enables detailed
analysis of the curved space-time around black holes. With nearly one hundred
signals observed so far and thousands expected in the next decade, their
population properties enable insights into stellar evolution and the expansion
of our Universe. However, the detectors are afflicted by transient noise
artefacts known as ""glitches"" which contaminate the signals and bias
inferences. Of the 90 signals detected to date, 18 were contaminated by
glitches. This feasibility study explores a new approach to transient
gravitational-wave data analysis using Gaussian processes, which model the
underlying physics of the glitch-generating mechanism rather than the explicit
realisation of the glitch itself. We demonstrate that if the Gaussian process
kernel function can adequately model the glitch morphology, we can recover the
parameters of simulated signals. Moreover, we find that the Gaussian processes
kernels used in this work are well-suited to modelling long-duration glitches
which are most challenging for existing glitch-mitigation approaches. Finally,
we show how the time-domain nature of our approach enables a new class of
time-domain tests of General Relativity, performing a re-analysis of the
inspiral-merger-ringdown test on the first observed binary black hole merger.
Our investigation demonstrates the feasibility of the Gaussian processes as an
alternative to the traditional framework but does not yet establish them as a
replacement. Therefore, we conclude with an outlook on the steps needed to
realise the full potential of the Gaussian process approach.

abundances constant with altitude and allowing the temperature-pressure profile
to freely adjust results in a moderately super-stellar carbon to oxygen ratio
(C/O=0.75^{+0.14}_{-0.17}) and metallicity ([M/H]=1.03^{+0.65}_{-1.01}).
Accounting for undetectable oxygen produced by thermal dissociation leads to
C/O=0.45^{+0.08}_{-0.10} and [M/H]=1.17^{+0.66}_{-1.01}. A retrieval that
assumes radiative-convective-thermochemical-equilibrium and naturally accounts
for thermal dissociation constrains C/O<0.34 (2$\sigma$) and
[M/H]=0.48^{+0.33}_{-0.29}, in line with the chemistry of the parent star.
Looking at the velocity information, we see a tantalising signature of
different Doppler shifts at the level of a few km/s for different molecules,
which might probe dynamics as a function of altitude and location on the planet
disk. Our results demonstrate that ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopy

Logistic Regression, and Random Forest) using 15 text feature extraction

significant impact in the field of deep learning. A substantial amount of
attention has been dedicated as a consequence to the description of scaling
laws, although mostly for supervised learning and only to a reduced extent for
reinforcement learning frameworks. In this paper we present an extensive study
of performance scaling for a cornerstone reinforcement learning algorithm,
AlphaZero. On the basis of a relationship between Elo rating, playing strength
and power-law scaling, we train AlphaZero agents on the games Connect Four and
Pentago and analyze their performance. We find that player strength scales as a
power law in neural network parameter count when not bottlenecked by available
compute, and as a power of compute when training optimally sized agents. We
observe nearly identical scaling exponents for both games. Combining the two
observed scaling laws we obtain a power law relating optimal size to compute
similar to the ones observed for language models. We find that the predicted
scaling of optimal neural network size fits our data for both games. This
scaling law implies that previously published state-of-the-art game-playing
models are significantly smaller than their optimal size, given the respective
compute budgets. We also show that large AlphaZero models are more sample
efficient, performing better than smaller models with the same amount of
training data.

reliability of user texts is often compromised by behavioural and emotional
dimensions. To this end, several attempts have been made in the state of the

computational psycholinguistics, personality traits and cognitive psychology
methods.
  In contrast, our method is fundamentally different since we employ a
psychoanalysis-based approach; in particular, we use the notion of Lacanian
discourse types, to capture and deeply understand real (possibly elusive)
characteristics, qualities and contents of texts, and evaluate their
reliability. As far as we know, this is the first time computational methods
are systematically combined with psychoanalysis. We believe such psychoanalytic
framework is fundamentally more effective than standard methods, since it
addresses deeper, quite primitive elements of human personality, behaviour and
expression which usually escape methods functioning at ""higher"", conscious
layers. In fact, this research is a first attempt to form a new paradigm of
psychoanalysis-driven interactive technologies, with broader impact and diverse
applications.
  To exemplify this generic approach, we apply it to the case-study of fake

we find that even slight deviations from integrability can be sensitively felt
by measuring these formerly conserved quantities in the case of the Salerno

issues than other neural computation counterparts when deployed in real-world
settings. This work addresses one of the practical circumstances that can
hinder the trustworthiness of this family of models: the possibility of
querying a trained model with samples far from the distribution of its training
data (also referred to as Out-of-Distribution or OoD data). Specifically, this
work presents a novel OoD detector that can identify whether test examples
input to a Spiking Neural Network belong to the distribution of the data over
which it was trained. For this purpose, we characterize the internal
activations of the hidden layers of the network in the form of spike count
patterns, which lay a basis for determining when the activations induced by a
test instance is atypical. Furthermore, a local explanation method is devised
to produce attribution maps revealing which parts of the input instance push
most towards the detection of an example as an OoD sample. Experimental results
are performed over several image classification datasets to compare the
proposed detector to other OoD detection schemes from the literature. As the
obtained results clearly show, the proposed detector performs competitively
against such alternative schemes, and produces relevance attribution maps that
conform to expectations for synthetically created OoD instances.

direct communication between wireless devices that follow different standards.
In spite of the many different proposals from the community to enable CTC, the
performance aspect of CTC is an equally important problem but has seldom been
studied before. We find this problem is extremely challenging, due to the
following reasons: on one hand, a link for CTC is essentially different from a
conventional wireless link. The conventional link indicators like RSSI
(received signal strength indicator) and SNR (signal to noise ratio) cannot be
used to directly characterize a CTC link. On the other hand, the indirect
indicators like PER (packet error rate), which is adopted by many existing CTC
proposals, cannot capture the short-term link behavior. As a result, the
existing CTC proposals fail to keep reliable performance under dynamic channel
conditions. In order to address the above challenge, we in this paper propose
AdaComm, a generic framework to achieve self-adaptive CTC in dynamic channels.
Instead of reactively adjusting the CTC sender, AdaComm adopts online learning
mechanism to adaptively adjust the decoding model at the CTC receiver. The
self-adaptive decoding model automatically learns the effective features
directly from the raw received signals that are embedded with the current
channel state. With the lossless channel information, AdaComm further adopts
the fine tuning and full training modes to cope with the continuous and abrupt
channel dynamics. We implement AdaComm and integrate it with two existing CTC
approaches that respectively employ CSI (channel state information) and RSSI as
the information carrier. The evaluation results demonstrate that AdaComm can
significantly reduce the SER (symbol error rate) by 72.9% and 49.2%,

Poisson statistics according to combinations of stretched exponential decays,
power laws and logarithmic forms. The analysis of the Mandel parameter shows
that these generalized coherent states exhibit (non-classical) sub-Poissonian
or super-Poissonian statistics of the number of excitations for small values of
the label, according to determined properties. The statistics is uniquely
sub-Poissonian for large values of the label. As particular cases, truncated
Wright generalized coherent states exhibit uniquely non-classical properties,
differently from the truncated Mittag-Leffler generalized coherent states.

important features from tens of thousands of genetic polymorphisms (reduced
from millions using a preprocessing step) and study the effects of a certain

thirteen future cognitive scores measuring different aspects of cognitive

genetic data have heterogeneous effects on different scores, with the trend
that the value of both hippocampi is negatively associated with the severity of
cognition deficits. Polygenic effects are observed for all thirteen cognitive

function. Shared genetic etiology exists, however, greater genetic
heterogeneity exists within disease classifications after accounting for the
baseline diagnosis status. These analyses are useful in further investigation
of functional mechanisms for AD evolution.

reserving. This is generally regarded as consisting of three components, namely
parameter, process and model errors. The first two of these components, and
their estimation, are well understood, but less so model error. Model error
itself is considered in two parts: one part that is capable of estimation from
past data (internal model error), and another part that is not (external model
error). Attention is focused here on internal model error. Estimation of this
error component is approached by means of Bayesian model averaging, using the
Bayesian interpretation of the LASSO. This is used to generate a set of
admissible models, each with its prior probability and the likelihood of
observed data. A posterior on the model set, conditional on the data, results,
and an estimate of model error (contained in a loss reserve) is obtained as the
variance of the loss reserve according to this posterior. The population of
models entering materially into the support of the posterior may turn out to be
thinner than desired, and bootstrapping of the LASSO is used to gain bulk. This
provides the bonus of an estimate of parameter error also. It turns out that
the estimates of parameter and model errors are entangled, and dissociation of
them is at least difficult, and possibly not even meaningful. These matters are
discussed. The majority of the discussion applies to forecasting generally, but
numerical illustration of the concepts is given in relation to insurance data
and the problem of insurance loss reserving.

ocean models with newly developed spatially-explicit fish stock models.
Typically, Individual-Based Models (IBMs) and models based on
Advection-Diffusion-Reaction (ADR) equations are employed for the fish stock
models. In this paper, we present a novel fish stock model called SPRAT for
end-to\hyp{}end ecosystem modeling based on Population Balance Equations (PBEs)
that combines the advantages of IBMs and ADR models while avoiding their main
drawbacks. SPRAT accomplishes this by describing the modeled ecosystem
processes from the perspective of individuals while still being based on
partial differential equations. We apply the SPRAT model to explore a
well-documented regime shift observed on the eastern Scotian Shelf in the 1990s
from a cod-dominated to a herring-dominated ecosystem. Model simulations are
able to reconcile the observed multitrophic dynamics with documented changes in
both fishing pressure and water temperature, followed by a predator-prey
reversal that may have impeded recovery of depleted cod stocks. We conclude
that our model can be used to generate new hypotheses and test ideas about

exhaustive simulations and experiments. Machine learning (ML) can accelerate
the process of searching for desirable ionic molecules through accurate and

descriptors and ML models for the ionic molecule suffer from the inefficient
adaptation of molecular graph structure. Besides, few works have investigated
the explainability of ML models to help understand the learned features that
can guide the design of efficient ionic molecules. In this work, we develop
both fingerprint-based ML models and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict
the CO$_2$ absorption in ILs. Fingerprint works on graph structure at the

the feature extraction and model prediction stage. We show that our method
outperforms previous ML models by reaching a high accuracy (MAE of 0.0137,

Technology (IT) project cost overruns, as is common, and cost overruns can be
shown to follow a power-law distribution, managers may be unwittingly exposing
their organizations to extreme risk by severely underestimating the probability
of large cost overruns. In this research, we collect and analyze a large sample
comprised of 5,392 IT projects to empirically examine the probability
distribution of IT project cost overruns. Further, we propose and examine a
mechanism that can explain such a distribution. Our results reveal that IT
projects are far riskier in terms of cost than normally assumed by decision
makers and scholars. Specifically, we found that IT project cost overruns
follow a power-law distribution in which there are a large number of projects
with relatively small overruns and a fat tail that includes a smaller number of
projects with extreme overruns. A possible generative mechanism for the
identified power-law distribution is found in interdependencies among
technological components in IT systems. We propose and demonstrate, through
computer simulation, that a problem in a single technological component can
lead to chain reactions in which other interdependent components are affected,
causing substantial overruns. What the power law tells us is that extreme IT
project cost overruns will occur and that the prevalence of these will be
grossly underestimated if managers assume that overruns follow a normal or
near-normal distribution. This underscores the importance of realistically
assessing and mitigating the cost risk of new IT projects up front.

reconstructing the complex image stimuli from fMRI (functional magnetic
resonance imaging) signals. Unlike previous works that reconstruct images with
single objects or simple shapes, our work aims to reconstruct image stimuli
that are rich in semantics, closer to everyday scenes, and can reveal more
perspectives. However, data scarcity of fMRI datasets is the main obstacle to
applying state-of-the-art deep learning models to this problem. We find that
incorporating an additional text modality is beneficial for the reconstruction
problem compared to directly translating brain signals to images. Therefore,
the modalities involved in our method are: (i) voxel-level fMRI signals, (ii)
observed images that trigger the brain signals, and (iii) textual description
of the images. To further address data scarcity, we leverage an aligned
vision-language latent space pre-trained on massive datasets. Instead of
training models from scratch to find a latent space shared by the three
modalities, we encode fMRI signals into this pre-aligned latent space. Then,
conditioned on embeddings in this space, we reconstruct images with a
generative model. The reconstructed images from our pipeline balance both
naturalness and fidelity: they are photo-realistic and capture the ground truth
image contents well.

to be a successful strategy, for a variety of vision and natural language
processing tasks. However, direct fine-tuning of the pre-trained model may be
suboptimal if there exist large discrepancies across data domains for
pre-training and fine-tuning. To tackle this issue, several previous studies
have proposed further pre-training strategies, where we continue to pre-train
the model on the target unlabeled dataset before fine-tuning. However, all of
them solely focus on language models and we empirically find that a Vision
Transformer is vulnerable to overfitting as we continue to pretrain the model
on target unlabeled data. In order to tackle this limitation, we propose
self-distillation as a regularization for a further pre-training stage.
Specifically, we first further pre-train the initial pre-trained model on the
target unlabeled data and then consider it as a teacher for self-distillation.
Then we take the same initial pre-trained model as a student and enforce its
hidden representations to be close to those of the teacher while optimizing the
student with a masked auto-encoding objective. We empirically validate the
efficacy of self-distillation on a variety of benchmark datasets for image and
text classification tasks. Experimentally, we show that our proposed method
outperforms all the relevant baselines. Theoretically, we analyze the proposed

a field theory in spacetime representation is briefly discussed.

  Structure",,,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  While the ultimate goal is to produce a tensegrity more than 6 struts, e.g. a
15-bar tensegrity, past experience has demonstrated that we must first develop
an innovative system that will facilitate the assembly of a general n-bar
tensegrity. To be successful, we believe the development of the new assembly
methodology must encompass not only the design of the clamping system but also
the design of the tensegrity itself, including the struts, the springs and the
spring-to-strut connectors. We therefore propose to develop the 15-bar in two
phases: Phase I will be the development of an innovative assembly method, and
Phase II will focus on the design and manufacture of a 15-bar tensegrity, with
a new strut design probably being part of this. Longer term goals will be aimed
at repackaging the wireless electronics on the new struts and adding encoders
to control the phase of the motors shafts.

attacks are commonly used to disrupt network services. Attack techniques are
always improving and due to the structure of the internet and properties of
network protocols it is difficult to keep detection and mitigation techniques
up to date. A lot of research has been conducted in this area which has
demonstrated the difficulty of preventing DDoS attacks altogether, therefore
the primary aim of most research is to maximize quality of service (QoS) for
legitimate users. This survey paper aims to provide a clear summary of DDoS
attacks and focuses on some recently proposed techniques for defence. The
research papers that are analysed in depth primarily focused on the use of
virtual machines (VMs) (HoneyMesh) and network function virtualization (NFV)
(VGuard and VFence).

of malware and exploits. We have seen scenarios where software vulnerabilities
have been disclosed by vendors and shortly after, operational exploits are
available on darknet forums and marketplaces. Many marketplace vendors offer
zero-day exploits that have not yet been discovered or disclosed. This trend
has led to security companies offering darknet analysis services to detect new
exploits and malware, providing proactive threat intelligence. This paper
presents information on the scale of malware distribution, the trends of
malware types offered, the methods for discovering new exploits and the
effectiveness of darknet analysis in detecting malware at the earliest possible
stage.

  Multicasting Automotive Messages in 5G NR C-V2X Networks","13 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology",,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) has been continuously evolving since
Release 14 of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for future
autonomous vehicles. Apart from automotive safety, 5G NR further bring new
capabilities to C-V2X for autonomous driving, such as real-time local update,
and coordinated driving. These capabilities rely on the provision of low
latency and high reliability from 5G NR. Among them, a basic demand is
broadcasting or multicasting environment update messages, such as cooperative
perception data, with high reliability and low latency from a Road Side Unit
(RSU) or a base station (BS). In other words, broadcasting multiple types of
automotive messages with high reliability and low latency is one of the key
issues in 5G NR C-V2X. In this work, we consider how to select Modulation and
Coding Scheme (MCS), RSU/BS, Forward Error Correction (FEC) code rate, to
maximize the system utility, which is a function of message delivery
reliability. We formulate the optimization problem as a nonlinear integer
programming problem. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard, we propose an
approximation algorithm, referred to as the Hyperbolic Successive Convex
Approximation (HSCA) algorithm, which uses the successive convex approximation
to find the optimal solution. In our simulations, we compare the performance of
HSCA with those of three algorithms respectively, including the baseline
algorithm, the heuristic algorithm, and the optimal solution. Our simulation
results show that HSCA outperforms the baseline and the heuristic algorithms
and is very competitive to the optimal solution.
