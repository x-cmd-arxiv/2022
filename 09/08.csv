homomorphic secret sharing, we study communication-efficient schemes for
computing linear combinations of coded symbols. Specifically, we design
low-bandwidth schemes that evaluate the weighted sum of $\ell$ coded symbols in
a codeword $\pmb{c}\in\mathbb{F}^n$, when we are given access to $d$ of the
remaining components in $\pmb{c}$.
  Formally, suppose that $\mathbb{F}$ is a field extension of $\mathbb{B}$ of
degree $t$. Let $\pmb{c}$ be a codeword in a Reed-Solomon code of dimension $k$
and our task is to compute the weighted sum of $\ell$ coded symbols. In this
paper, for some $s<t$, we provide an explicit scheme that performs this task by
downloading $d(t-s)$ sub-symbols in $\mathbb{B}$ from $d$ available nodes,
whenever $d\geq \ell|\mathbb{B}|^s-\ell+k$. In many cases, our scheme
outperforms previous schemes in the literature.
  Furthermore, we provide a characterization of evaluation schemes for general
linear codes. Then in the special case of Reed-Solomon codes, we use this
characterization to derive a lower bound for the evaluation bandwidth.

Conducting N-of-1 trials, which are single-person randomized controlled trials,
is the gold standard for their analysis. In this study, we propose to
re-analyze existing population-level studies as N-of-1 trials as an
alternative, and we use gait as a use case for illustration. Gait data were
collected from 16 young and healthy participants under fatigued and
non-fatigued, as well as under single-task (only walking) and dual-task
(walking while performing a cognitive task) conditions. We first computed
standard population-level ANOVA models to evaluate differences in gait
parameters (stride length and stride time) across conditions. Then, we
estimated the effect of the interventions on gait parameters on the individual
level through Bayesian linear mixed models, viewing each participant as their
own trial, and compared the results. The results illustrated that while few
overall population-level effects were visible, individual-level analyses showed
nuanced differences between participants. Baseline values of the gait
parameters varied largely among all participants, and the changes induced by
fatigue and cognitive task performance were also highly heterogeneous, with
some individuals showing effects in opposite direction. These differences
between population-level and individual-level analyses were more pronounced for
the fatigue intervention compared to the cognitive task intervention. Following
our empirical analysis, we discuss re-analyzing population studies through the
lens of N-of-1 trials more generally and highlight important considerations and
requirements. Our work encourages future studies to investigate individual

Goldfish is reorg resilient (i.e., honestly produced blocks are guaranteed
inclusion in the ledger) and supports fast confirmation (i.e., the expected
confirmation latency is independent of the desired security level). We show
that subsampling validators can improve the communication efficiency of
Goldfish, and that Goldfish is composable with finality gadgets and
accountability gadgets, which improves state-of-the-art ebb-and-flow protocols.
Attacks on LMD GHOST exploit lack of coordination among honest validators,
typically provided by a locking mechanism in classical BFT protocols. However,
locking requires votes from a quorum of all participants and is not compatible
with dynamic availability. Goldfish is powered by a novel coordination
mechanism to synchronize the honest validators' actions under dynamic

binding energies, the charge radii and the giant monopole resonances of a set
of spherical nuclei. The interactions are classified according to their ability
to describe these characteristics and we show that a tight correlation between
the symmetry energy and its slope is obtained providing $N=Z$ and $N\ne Z$
nuclei are described with the same accuracy (mainly driven by the charge radius
data). By additionally imposing the constraints from isobaric analog states and
neutron skin radius in $^{208}$Pb, we obtain the following estimates:
$E_{sym,2}=31.8\pm 0.7$ MeV and $L_{sym,2}=58.1\pm 9.0$ MeV. We then analyze

computations, are often computed via a sequence of calls to existing libraries
of building blocks (such as those provided by BLAS and LAPACK). A sequence
identifies a computing strategy, i.e., an algorithm, and normally for one
linear algebra expression many alternative algorithms exist. Although
mathematically equivalent, those algorithms might exhibit significant
differences in terms of performance. Several high-level languages and tools for
matrix computations such as Julia, Armadillo, Linnea, etc., make algorithmic
choices by minimizing the number of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs). However,
there can be several algorithms that share the same (or have nearly identical)
number of FLOPs; in many cases, these algorithms exhibit execution times which
are statistically equivalent and one could arbitrarily select one of them as
the best algorithm. It is however not unlikely to find cases where the
execution times are significantly different from one another (despite the FLOP
count being almost the same). It is also possible that the algorithm that
minimizes FLOPs is not the one that minimizes execution time. In this work, we
develop a methodology to test the reliability of FLOPs as discriminant for
linear algebra algorithms. Given a set of algorithms (for an instance of a
linear algebra expression) as input, the methodology ranks them into
performance classes; i.e., multiple algorithms are allowed to share the same
rank. To this end, we measure the algorithms iteratively until the changes in
the ranks converge to a value close to zero. FLOPs are a valid discriminant for
an instance if all the algorithms with minimum FLOPs are assigned the best
rank; otherwise, the instance is regarded as an anomaly, which can then be used
in the investigation of the root cause of performance differences.

estimating the mutual information between the representation and a space of

bottleneck: information must be captured by simple predictors, mapping concepts
to clusters in representation space. This approach, which we call reverse
linear probing, provides a single number sensitive to the semanticity of the
representation. This measure is also able to detect when the representation
contains combinations of concepts (e.g., ""red apple"") instead of just
individual attributes (""red"" and ""apple"" independently). Finally, we propose to

time-domain fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). By leveraging the l1-norm
extraction method, we propose a 1-D Fluorescence Lifetime AdderNet (FLAN)
without multiplication-based convolutions to reduce the computational
complexity. Further, we compressed fluorescence decays in temporal dimension
using a log-scale merging technique to discard redundant temporal information
derived as log-scaling FLAN (FLAN+LS). FLAN+LS achieves 0.11 and 0.23
compression ratios compared with FLAN and a conventional 1-D convolutional
neural network (1-D CNN) while maintaining high accuracy in retrieving
lifetimes. We extensively evaluated FLAN and FLAN+LS using synthetic and real
data. A traditional fitting method and other non-fitting, high-accuracy
algorithms were compared with our networks for synthetic data. Our networks
attained a minor reconstruction error in different photon-count scenarios. For
real data, we used fluorescent beads' data acquired by a confocal microscope to
validate the effectiveness of real fluorophores, and our networks can
differentiate beads with different lifetimes. Additionally, we implemented the
network architecture on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) with a
post-quantization technique to shorten the bit-width, thereby improving
computing efficiency. FLAN+LS on hardware achieves the highest computing
efficiency compared to 1-D CNN and FLAN. We also discussed the applicability of
our network and hardware architecture for other time-resolved biomedical
applications using photon-efficient, time-resolved sensors.

feedforward information across layers through different weight connections,
approximating feedback and feedforward connections, and linearizing the

between the noisy signal and the visual stimuli, thus attributing meaning to
the speech by amplifying relevant information and suppressing noise.
Experiments conducted over a Grid Corpus and CHiME3-based dataset show that
MBURST can reproduce similar mask reconstructions to the multimodal

been detected in Kepler light curves depends on the stellar mass $M_\star$ and
age $t_\star$. Our sample consists of $\approx 850$ FGK stars hosting
transiting planet candidates detected from the prime Kepler mission. For these
stars, atmospheric parameters have been derived using high-resolution spectra
from the California-Kepler survey, and rotational modulation has been searched
in Kepler light curves homogeneously. We fit stellar models to the atmospheric
parameters, Gaia parallax, and 2MASS magnitude of these stars and obtain
samples drawn from the posterior probability distributions for their masses and
ages under a given, uninformative prior. We combine them with the result of
rotational modulation search to simultaneously infer the mass-age distribution
of the sample as well as $f(M_\star, t_\star)$, in a manner that fully takes
into account mass and age uncertainties of individual stars. We find that $f$
remains near unity up to $t_\star \sim 3\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ and drops to almost
zero by $t_\star \sim 5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, although the trend is less clearly
detected for stars with $\lesssim 0.9\,M_\odot$ due to weaker age constraints.
This finding is consistent with a view that the detection of rotational
modulation is limited by photometric precision to younger stars that exhibit
higher-amplitude modulation, and suggests that the detectability of rotational
modulation in Kepler light curves is insensitive to metallicity and activity
cycles for stars younger than the Sun.

we show that there is a criniferous disjoint-type entire function whose Julia
set is not a Cantor bouquet. We also provide a new characterisation of Cantor

set of escaping points, and use this to give a new intrinsic description of a

  We further impose the contiguity constraint on items such that items are

a consecutive block of items. We present extensive results to achieve either
proportionality with an additive approximate factor (PROPa) or EF1, where PROPa
is a weaker fairness notion than EF1. In particular, we show that for identical
valuations, achieving PROPa requires $\Theta(nT)$ adjustments. Moreover, we
show that it is hopeless to make any significant improvement for either PROPa

galaxy cluster Abell 2256 using the LOFAR, uGMRT, and VLA. These observations
combined with archival X-ray data allowed us to study the halo emission with
unprecedented detail. The integrated radio emission from the entire halo is
characterized by an ultra-steep spectrum, which can be described by a power law
with $\alpha_{144 \rm MHz}^{1.5 \rm GHz}=-1.63\pm0.03$, and a radial steepening
in the outer regions. The halo is significantly underluminous according to the
scaling relations between radio power and mass at 1.4 GHz but not at 150 MHz;
ultra-steep spectrum halos are predicted to be statistically underluminous.
Despite the complex structure of this system, the radio halo morphology is
remarkably similar to that of the X-ray emission. The radio surface brightness
distribution across the halo is strongly correlated with the X-ray brightness
of the intracluster medium. The derived correlations show sublinear slopes and
there are distinct structures: the core is $\rm I_{R}\propto I_{X}^{1.51}$, the
outermost region $\rm I_{R}\propto I_{X}^{0.41}$, and we find radio
morphological connections with X-ray discontinuities. We also find a strong
anti-correlation between the radio spectral index and the X-ray surface
brightness, implying radial steepening. We suggests that the halo core is
either related to old plasma from previous AGN activity, being advected,
compressed and re-accelerated by mechanisms activated by the cold front or less
turbulent with strong magnetic field in the core. The change in the radio vs
X-ray correlation slopes in the outer regions of the halo could be due to a
radial decline of magnetic field, increase in the number density of seed
particles or increasing turbulence. Our findings suggest that that the emitting
volume is not homogenous according to turbulence re-acceleration models.

flow dynamics around two side-by-side square cylinders from sparse,
time-resolved, velocity measurements in the wake. We use Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (POD) to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and then
explore two different reconstruction approaches: in the first approach, we use
the subspace system identification algorithm n4sid to extract a linear
dynamical model directly from the data (including the modelling and measurement
error covariance matrices) and then employ Kalman filter theory to synthesize a
linearly optimal estimator. In the second approach, the estimator matrices are
directly identified using n4sid. A systematic study reveals that the first
strategy outperforms the second in terms of reconstruction accuracy, robustness
and computational efficiency. We also consider the problem of sensor placement.
A greedy approach based on the QR pivoting algorithm is compared against
sensors placed at the POD mode peaks; we show that the former approach is more
accurate in recovering the flow characteristics away from the cylinders. We
demonstrate that a linear dynamic model with a sufficiently large number of
states and relatively few measurements, can recover accurately complex flow
features, such as the interaction of the irregular flapping motion of the jet
emanating from the gap with the vortices shed from the cylinders as well as the
convoluted patterns downstream arising from the amalgamation of the individual
wakes. The proposed methodology is entirely data-driven, does not have tunable
parameters, and the resulting matrices are unique (to within a linear
coordinate transformation of the state vector). The method can be applied
directly to either experimental or computational data.

detection of a possible ongoing gas accretion event in a Blue Compact Dwarf
(BCD) galaxy, MaNGA 8313-1901, observed by the Mapping Nearby Galaxies and
Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) program. This galaxy has a distinct
off-centered blue clump to the northeast (the NE clump) that shows low
metallicity and enhanced star-formation. The kinematics of the gas in the NE
clump also seems to be detached from the host BCD galaxy. Together with the
metallicity drop of the NE clump, it suggests that the NE clump likely has an
external origin, such as the gas accretion or galaxy interaction, rather than
an internal origin, such as an \hii~complex in the disk. After removing the
underlying host component, we find that the spectrum of the ""pure"" clump can
match very well with a modeled spectrum containing a stellar population of the
young stars ($\le 7$ Myr) only. This may imply that the galaxy is experiencing
an accretion of cold gas, instead of a merger event involving galaxies with
significant pre-existing old stars. We also find signs of another clump (the SW
clump) at the south-west corner of the host galaxy, and the two clumps may
share the same origin of gas accretion.

  Generation for Sensing and Localization Pipelines in CAVs",,,,,"cs.RO cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A major challenge in cooperative sensing is to weight the measurements taken
from the various sources to get an accurate result. Ideally, the weights should
be inversely proportional to the error in the sensing information. However,
previous cooperative sensor fusion approaches for autonomous vehicles use a
fixed error model, in which the covariance of a sensor and its recognizer
pipeline is just the mean of the measured covariance for all sensing scenarios.
The approach proposed in this paper estimates error using key predictor terms
that have high correlation with sensing and localization accuracy for accurate
covariance estimation of each sensor observation. We adopt a tiered fusion
model consisting of local and global sensor fusion steps. At the local fusion
level, we add in a covariance generation stage using the error model for each
sensor and the measured distance to generate the expected covariance matrix for
each observation. At the global sensor fusion stage we add an additional stage
to generate the localization covariance matrix from the key predictor term
velocity and combines that with the covariance generated from the local fusion
for accurate cooperative sensing. To showcase our method, we built a set of
1/10 scale model autonomous vehicles with scale accurate sensing capabilities
and classified the error characteristics against a motion capture system.
Results show an average and max improvement in RMSE when detecting vehicle
positions of 1.42x and 1.78x respectively in a four-vehicle cooperative fusion

dark matter. A cascade theory for dark matter is proposed to provide extra
insights, similar to the cascade phenomenon in hydrodynamic turbulence. The
kinetic energy is cascaded in dark matter from small to large scales involves a
constant rate $\varepsilon_u$ ($\approx -4.6\times 10^{-7}m^2/s^3$). Confirmed
by N-body simulations, energy cascade leads to a two-thirds law for kinetic
energy $v_r^2$ on scale $r$ such that $v_r^2 \propto (\varepsilon_u r)^{2/3}$.
A four-thirds law can be established for mean halo density $\rho_s$ enclosed in
the scale radius $r_s$ such that $\rho_s \propto
\varepsilon_u^{2/3}G^{-1}r_s^{-4/3}$, which was confirmed by galaxy rotation
curves. Critical properties of dark matter might be obtained by identifying key
constants on relevant scales. The largest halo scale $r_l$ can be determined by
$-u_0^3/\varepsilon_u$, where $u_0$ is the velocity dispersion. The smallest
scale $r_{\eta}$ is dependent on the nature of dark matter. For collisionless
dark matter, $r_{\eta} \propto (-{G\hbar/\varepsilon_{u}}) ^{1/3}\approx
10^{-13}m$ is found along with the mass scale $m_X\propto
(-\varepsilon_u\hbar^5G^{-4})^{1/9}\approx 10^{12}GeV$, where $\hbar$ is the
Planck constant. An uncertainty principle for momentum and acceleration
fluctuations is also postulated. For self-interacting dark matter, $r_{\eta}
\propto \varepsilon_{u}^2 G^{-3}(\sigma/m)^3$, where $\sigma/m$ is the
cross-section of interaction. On halo scale, the energy cascade leads to an
asymptotic density slope $\gamma=-4/3$ for fully virialized haloes with a
vanishing radial flow, which might explain the nearly universal halo density.
Based on the continuity equation, halo density is analytically shown to be
closely dependent on the radial flow and mass accretion, such that simulated
haloes can have different limiting slopes.

scaled Gaussian distributions (NC-MSG). Using the Fisher-Rao information
geometry associated to this distribution, we derive a Riemannian gradient
descent algorithm. This algorithm is leveraged for two minimization problems.
The first one is the minimization of a regularized negative log- likelihood
(NLL). The latter makes the trade-off between a white Gaussian distribution and
the NC-MSG. Conditions on the regularization are given so that the existence of
a minimum to this problem is guaranteed without assumptions on the samples.
Then, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two NC-MSG is derived. This
divergence enables us to define a minimization problem to compute centers of
mass of several NC-MSGs. The proposed Riemannian gradient descent algorithm is
leveraged to solve this second minimization problem. Numerical experiments show
the good performance and the speed of the Riemannian gradient descent on the
two problems. Finally, a Nearest centroid classifier is implemented leveraging
the KL divergence and its associated center of mass. Applied on the large scale
dataset Breizhcrops, this classifier shows good accuracies as well as
robustness to rigid transformations of the test set.

its Random-Initialization (RI) counterpart. We take the first step to
investigate the complementarity between PT and RI in resource-rich scenarios
via two probing analyses, and find that: 1) PT improves NOT the accuracy, but
the generalization by achieving flatter loss landscapes than that of RI; 2) PT
improves NOT the confidence of lexical choice, but the negative diversity by
assigning smoother lexical probability distributions than that of RI. Based on
these insights, we propose to combine their complementarities with a model
fusion algorithm that utilizes optimal transport to align neurons between PT
and RI. Experiments on two resource-rich translation benchmarks, WMT'17
English-Chinese (20M) and WMT'19 English-German (36M), show that PT and RI
could be nicely complementary to each other, achieving substantial improvements

magnetohydrodynamic simulations of thin, radiation-pressure-dominated accretion

initialized using the Shakura-Sunyaev model with a mass accretion rate of
$\dot{M} = 3 L_\mathrm{Edd}/c^2$ (corresponding to $L=0.17 L_\mathrm{Edd}$).
Our previous work demonstrated that such disks are thermally unstable when
accretion is driven by an $\alpha$-viscosity. In the present work, we test the
hypothesis that strong magnetic fields can both drive accretion through the
magneto-rotational instability and restore stability to such disks. We test
four initial magnetic field configurations: 1) a zero-net-flux case with a
single, radially extended set of magnetic field loops (dipole); 2) a
zero-net-flux case with two radially extended sets of magnetic field loops of
opposite polarity stacked vertically (quadrupole); 3) a zero-net-flux case with
multiple radially concentric rings of alternating polarity (multi-loop); and 4)
a net-flux, vertical magnetic field configuration (vertical). In all cases, the
fields are initially weak, with the gas-to-magnetic pressure ratio $\gtrsim
100$. Based on the results of these simulations, we find that the dipole and
multi-loop configurations remain thermally unstable like their
$\alpha$-viscosity counterpart, in our case collapsing vertically on the local
thermal timescale and never fully recovering. The vertical case, on the other
hand, stabilizes and remains so for the duration of our tests (many thermal
timescales). The quadrupole case is intermediate, showing signs of both
stability and instability. The key stabilizing criteria is, $P_\mathrm{mag}
\gtrsim 0.5P_\mathrm{tot}$ with strong toroidal fields near the disk midplane.

digital images. However, the recent cutting-edge generation methods enable high
qualities of synthesis in CG images, which makes this challenging task even
trickier. To address this issue, a joint learning strategy with deep texture
and high-frequency features for CG image detection is proposed. We first
formulate and deeply analyze the different acquisition processes of CG and PG
images. Based on the finding that multiple different modules in image
acquisition will lead to different sensitivity inconsistencies to the
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based rendering in images, we propose a deep
texture rendering module for texture difference enhancement and discriminative
texture representation. Specifically, the semantic segmentation map is
generated to guide the affine transformation operation, which is used to
recover the texture in different regions of the input image. Then, the
combination of the original image and the high-frequency components of the
original and rendered images are fed into a multi-branch neural network
equipped with attention mechanisms, which refines intermediate features and
facilitates trace exploration in spatial and channel dimensions respectively.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets and a newly constructed dataset
with more realistic and diverse images show that the proposed approach
outperforms existing methods in the field by a clear margin. Besides, results
also demonstrate the detection robustness and generalization ability of the
proposed approach to postprocessing operations and generative adversarial

$G(n,p)$ must also contain \emph{many} copies of $H'$. We then show that

sub-leading components of the metric into our considerations and we argue that
these two additional fields are compulsory phase space variables in the
derivation of Carrollian hydrodynamics from symmetries. We then present a new
notion of symmetry, called the near-Carrollian diffeomorphism, and demonstrate
that this symmetry consistently yields a complete set of Carrollian
hydrodynamic equations. Furthermore, due to the presence of the new phase space
fields, our results thus generalize those already presented in the previous
literatures. Lastly, the Noether charges associated with the near-Carrollian
diffeomorphism and their time evolutions are also discussed.

a ubiquitous problem in data science. Granger causality measure (GCM) and
conditional Granger causality measure (cGCM) are widely used statistical
methods for causal inference and effective connectivity analysis in
neuroimaging research. Both GCM and cGCM have frequency-domain formulations
that are developed based on a heuristic algorithm for matrix decompositions.
The goal of this work is to generalize GCM and cGCM measures and their
frequency-domain formulations by using a theoretic framework for minimum
entropy (ME) estimation. The proposed ME-estimation method extends the
classical theory of minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation for stochastic
processes. It provides three formulations of cGCM that include Geweke's
original time-domain cGCM as a special case. But all three frequency-domain
formulations of cGCM are different from previous methods. Experimental results
based on simulations have shown that one of the proposed frequency-domain cGCM
has enhanced sensitivity and specificity in detecting network connections
compared to other methods. In an example based on in vivo functional magnetic
resonance imaging, the proposed frequency-domain measure cGCM can significantly
enhance the consistency between the structural and effective connectivity of
human brain networks.

adenine layers by these water dimers causes a local surface chiral inversion in
a way that the neighboring homochiral adenine molecules become heterochiral
after hydration, resulting in a mismatched hydrogen-bond pattern between
neighboring adenine molecules. Furthermore, the mutual influence between the

experimental realization. Changes in weight are observed for the YBCO material
itself, which is in a non-superconducting state at room temperature but

However, unlike traditional deep learning approaches, the analysis and study of
the robustness of SNNs to adversarial examples remain relatively
underdeveloped. In this work we focus on advancing the adversarial attack side
of SNNs and make three major contributions. First, we show that successful
white-box adversarial attacks on SNNs are highly dependent on the underlying
surrogate gradient technique. Second, using the best surrogate gradient
technique, we analyze the transferability of adversarial attacks on SNNs and
other state-of-the-art architectures like Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Big
Transfer Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We demonstrate that SNNs are not
often deceived by adversarial examples generated by Vision Transformers and
certain types of CNNs. Third, due to the lack of an ubiquitous white-box attack
that is effective across both the SNN and CNN/ViT domains, we develop a new
white-box attack, the Auto Self-Attention Gradient Attack (Auto SAGA). Our
novel attack generates adversarial examples capable of fooling both SNN models
and non-SNN models simultaneously. Auto SAGA is as much as $87.9\%$ more
effective on SNN/ViT model ensembles than conventional white-box attacks like
PGD. Our experiments and analyses are broad and rigorous covering three
datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet), five different white-box attacks
and nineteen different classifier models (seven for each CIFAR dataset and five
different models for ImageNet).

selected from SDSS and AEGIS, which fall within the JWST/HST CEERS survey area.
A PSF library is constructed based on stars in the full field-of-view of the
data and used with the 2-dimensional image modeling tool galight to decompose
the quasar and its host with multi-band filters available for HST ACS+WFC3 and
JWST NIRCAM (12 filters covering HST F606W to JWST F444W). As demonstrated,
JWST provides the first capability to detect quasar hosts at $z>3$ and enables
spatially-resolved studies of the underlying stellar populations at $z\sim2$
within morphological structures (spiral arms, bar) not possible with HST.
Overall, we find quasar hosts to be disk-like, lack merger signatures, and have
sizes generally more compact than typical star-forming galaxies at their
respective stellar mass, thus in agreement with results at lower redshifts. The
fortuitous face-on orientation of SDSSJ1420+5300A at $z = 1.646$ enables us to
find higher star formation and younger ages in the central $2-4$ kpc region
relative to the outskirts, which may help explain the relatively compact nature
of quasar hosts and pose a challenge to AGN feedback models.

intriguing possibility of detecting even light dark matter in conventional
direct detection experiments or underground neutrino detectors. The mechanism
also significantly enhances sensitivity to models with very large nuclear
scattering rates, where the atmosphere and rock overburden efficiently stop
standard non-relativistic dark matter particles before they could reach the
detector. In this article, we demonstrate that cosmic-ray upscattering
essentially closes the window for strongly interacting dark matter in the
(sub-)GeV mass range. Arriving at this conclusion crucially requires a detailed
treatment of both nuclear form factors and inelastic dark matter-nucleus
scattering, as well as including the full momentum-transfer dependence of
scattering amplitudes. We illustrate the latter point by considering three
generic situations where such a momentum-dependence is particularly relevant,
namely for interactions dominated by the exchange of light vector or scalar
mediators, respectively, and for dark matter particles of finite size. As a
final concrete example, we apply our analysis to a putative hexaquark state,
which has been suggested as a viable baryonic dark matter candidate. Once
again, we find that the updated constraints derived in this work close a
significant part of otherwise unconstrained parameter space.

companion paper. The 9d/8d component can be understood as F/M-theory on a
twisted fibration of the Klein bottle over a circle, while the new
seven-dimensional components are described as IIB on Bieberbach manifolds with
a duality bundle and RR-NSNS backgrounds turned on. All the new components can
be obtained from previously known theories by turning on certain discrete theta
angles; however, the spectrum of massive objects is very different, and most
strikingly, they feature an incomplete lattice of BPS strings, showing that
string BPS completeness is not true in general even with sixteen supercharges.
In all cases we find non-BPS representatives for each value of the charge, so
the Completeness Principle is satisfied. We also analyze analogous theta angles

stochastic protocols that may only succeed with some probability, in which case
the quantum relative entropy is insufficient to characterize the rates of
asymptotic state transformations, and a new entropic quantity based on a
regularization of the Hilbert projective metric comes into play. Such a
scenario is motivated by a setting where the cost associated with
transformations of quantum states, typically taken to be the number of copies
of a given state, is instead identified with the size of the quantum memory
needed to realize the protocol. Our approach allows for constructing
transformation protocols that achieve strictly higher rates than those imposed
by the relative entropy. Focusing on the task of resource distillation, we give
broadly applicable strong converse bounds on the asymptotic rates of
probabilistic distillation protocols, and show them to be tight in relevant
settings such as entanglement distillation with non-entangling operations. This
generalizes and extends previously known limitations that only applied to

centers of approximately two-thirds of spiral disks in the nearby Universe. Due
to gravitational interactions between the bar and the other components of
galaxies, it is expected that angular momentum and matter will redistribute
over long (Gyr) timescales in barred galaxies. Previous work ignoring the gas
phase of galaxies has conclusively demonstrated that bars should slow their
rotation over time due to their interaction with dark matter halos. We have
performed a simulation of a Milky Way-like galactic disk hosting a strong bar
which includes a state-of-the-art model of the interstellar medium and a live
dark matter halo. In this simulation the bar pattern does not slow down over
time, and instead remains at a stable, constant rate of rotation. This behavior
has been observed in previous simulations using more simplified models for the
interstellar gas, but the apparent lack of secular evolution has remained
unexplained. We find that the presence of the gas phase arrests the process by
which the dark matter halo slows down a bar, a phenomenon we term bar locking.
This locking is responsible for stabilizing the bar pattern speed. We find that
in a Milky Way-like disk, a gas fraction of only about 5\% is necessary for
this mechanism to operate. Our result naturally explains why nearly all
observed bars rotate rapidly and is especially relevant for our understanding
of how the Milky Way arrived at its present state.

consistent with capture than theft. Our results lend further credence to the
notion that planets on more distant (>100au) orbits may not be orbiting their

cosmological zoom-in simulations of dwarf galaxies within the halo mass range
$1-4\times10^9M_\odot$. The employed LYRA simulation model features resolved
interstellar medium physics and individual, resolved supernova explosions. In
our results, we discover an interesting intermediate population of dwarf

they recommence star formation in a synchronous way, and remain star-forming

not a good indicator of survival close to the threshold. While the star

the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) archival data of the
\co line toward the protoplanetary disk around TW Hya and discovered extremely
broad line wings due to the pressure broadening. In conjunction with a
previously reported optically thin CO isotopologue line, the pressure broadened
line wings enabled us to directly determine the midplane gas density for the
first time. The gas surface density at $\sim5$ au from the central star reaches
$\sim 10^3\ {\rm g\ cm^{-2}}$, which suggests that the inner region of the disk
has enough mass to form a Jupiter-mass planet. Additionally, the gas surface
density drops at the inner cavity by $\sim2$ orders of magnitude compared to
outside the cavity. We also found a low CO abundance of $\sim 10^{-6}$ with
respect to H$_2$, even inside the CO snowline, which suggests conversion of CO
to less volatile species. Combining our results with previous studies, the gas
surface density jumps at $r\sim 20$ au, suggesting that the inner region

discuss include the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model and its deformations, several
types of spinless and spinful free-fermion models, and the Hubbard model. This
language enables a decomposition of the Hilbert space into dynamically
disconnected sectors that reduce to the conventional quantum number sectors for
regular symmetries. In addition, we find examples of non-standard conserved
quantities even in some simple cases, which demonstrates the need to enlarge
the usual definitions of symmetries and conserved quantities. In the case of
free-fermion models, this decomposition is related to the decompositions of
Hilbert space via irreducible representations of certain Lie groups proposed in
earlier works, while the algebra perspective applies more broadly, in
particular also to arbitrary interacting models. Further, the von Neumann
Double Commutant Theorem (DCT) enables a systematic construction of local
operators with a given symmetry or commutant algebra, potentially eliminating
the need for ""brute-force"" numerical searches carried out in the literature,
and we show examples of such applications of the DCT. This paper paves the way
for both systematic construction of families of models with exact scars and
characterization of such families in terms of non-standard symmetries, pursued

to Majorana neutrinos. The potential physics reach of next-generation
experiments also depends on the nature of the neutrino. We find that a

reionization, could be surrounded by a high covering fraction of the
metal-enriched, neutral-gaseous clouds. This implies that the metal enrichment
of low-mass galaxies is highly efficient, and further support that in low-mass

interstellar or circumgalactic channels with low column-density neutral gas.

subspaces seen in models with exact QMBS, i.e., the large ""thermal"" subspace
and the small ""non-thermal"" subspace, which are attributed to the existence of
unconventional non-local conserved quantities in the commutant; hence this
unifies the study of conventional symmetries and weak ergodicity breaking
phenomena into a single framework. Furthermore, this language enables us to use
the von Neumann Double Commutant Theorem (DCT) to formally write down the
exhaustive algebra of all Hamiltonians with a desired set of QMBS. We
illustrate this using several standard examples of QMBS, including the spin-1/2
ferromagnetic, AKLT, spin-1 XY $\pi$-bimagnon, and the electronic
$\eta$-pairing towers of states; and in each of these cases we explicitly write
down a set of generators for the full algebra of Hamiltonians with these QMBS.
Understanding this hidden structure in QMBS Hamiltonians also allows us to
recover results of previous ""brute-force"" numerical searches for such
Hamiltonians. In addition, this language clearly demonstrates the equivalence
of several unified formalisms for QMBS proposed in the literature, and also
illustrates the connection between two apparently distinct classes of QMBS
Hamiltonians -- those that are captured by the so-called Shiraishi-Mori
construction, and those that lie beyond. Finally, we show that this framework
motivates a precise definition for QMBS that automatically implies that they
violate the conventional Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), and we
discuss its implications to dynamics.

outflow rates $\dot{M}_{out}=6-300$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, mass-loading factors
$\eta = \dot{M}_{out}/SFR = 0.1-1$, and an average outflow mass escape fraction

radii of 0.2-0.9 kpc and have short dynamical times ($t_{dyn}=R_{out}/v_{out}$)
in the range 0.5-2.8 Myr. The outflow detection rate is higher in nuclei
dominated by starbursts (SBs, 14/15=93%) than in active galactic nuclei (AGN,
6/11=55%). Outflows perpendicular to the kinematic major axis are mainly found
in interacting SBs. We also find that our sample does not follow the

our analysis, we include a sample of nearby main-sequence galaxies (SFR =
0.3-17 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) with detected molecular outflows from the

traced by $L_{IR}$ ($v_{out} \propto SFR^{0.25\pm0.01})$, which is consistent

away from our line-of-sight to the central X-ray source. We test two different
interpretations for the latter: first that the reprocessing occurs in a classic
AGN torus, as invoked in unification models, and second that the reprocessing
occurs in the accretion disc. Both models can successfully reproduce the

into $SU(2)$ and $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$. For a knot $K$ in the 3-sphere, Lin and
others showed that a Casson-style count of $SU(2)$ representations with fixed
meridional holonomy recovers the signature function of $K$. For knots whose
complement contains no closed essential surface, we show there is an analogous
count for $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ representations. We then prove the $SL(2,
\mathbb{R})$ count is determined by the $SU(2)$ count and a single integer
$h(K)$, allowing us to show the existence of various $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$
representations using only elementary topological hypotheses.
  Combined with the translation extension locus of Culler-Dunfield, we use this
to prove left-orderability of many 3-manifold groups obtained by cyclic
branched covers and Dehn fillings on broad classes of knots. We give further
applications to the existence of real parabolic representations, including a
generalization of the Riley Conjecture (proved by Gordon) to alternating knots.
These invariants exhibit some intriguing patterns that deserve explanation, and
we include many open questions.
  The close connection between $SU(2)$ and $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ comes from
viewing their representations as the real points of the appropriate $SL(2,
\mathbb{C})$ character variety. While such real loci are typically highly
singular at the reducible characters that are common to both $SU(2)$ and $SL(2,
\mathbb{R})$, in the relevant situations, we show how to resolve these real
algebraic sets into smooth manifolds. We construct these resolutions using the
geometric transition $S^2 \to \mathbb{E}^2 \to \mathbb{H}^2$, studied from the
perspective of projective geometry, and they allow us to pass between
Casson-Lin counts of $SU(2)$ and $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ representations unimpeded.

near-infrared (NIR, $JHK_s$) time-series observations of 42 RRL, 8 T2Cs, and 10
eclipsing binary candidate variables in NGC 6441. The multi-epoch observations
were obtained using the FLAMINGOS-2 instrument on the 8-m Gemini South

and T2C variables including their light curves, instability strip,
period--amplitude diagrams, and period--luminosity and period--wesenheit
relations (PLRs and PWRs) in $JHK_s$ filters. NIR pulsation properties of RRL
variables are well fitted with theoretical models that have canonical helium
content and mean-metallicity of NGC 6441 ([Fe/H]$=-0.44\pm0.07$~dex). The
helium-enhanced RRL models predict brighter NIR magnitudes and bluer colors
than the observations of RRL in the cluster. This suggests that these RRL
variables in NGC 6441 are either not significantly helium enhanced as
previously thought or the impact of such enhancement is smaller in NIR than the
predictions of the pulsation models. We also use theoretical calibrations of
RRL period--luminosity--metallicity (PLZ) relations to simultaneously estimate
the mean reddening, $E(J-K_s)=0.26\pm0.06$~mag, and the distance,
$d=12.67\pm0.09$~kpc, to NGC 6441. Our mean reddening value and the distance
are consistent with the independent estimates from the bulge reddening map
based on red clump stars and the latest Gaia data, respectively. Our distance
and reddening values provide a very good agreement between the PLRs of T2Cs in
NGC 6441 and those for RRL and T2Cs in Galactic globular clusters that span a

To interpret these observations, we need to compare them to predictions from

star formation history ($\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$) as an input. Large uncertainties
remain in the shape and evolution of this function. In this work, we propose a
simple analytical function for $\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$. Variations of this function
can be easily interpreted, because the parameters link to its shape in an
intuitive way. We fit our analytical function to the star-forming gas of the

behaviour well. As an example application, we investigate the effect of
systematic variations in the $\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$ parameters on the predicted
mass distribution of locally merging binary black holes (BBH). Our main
findings are: I) the locations of features are remarkably robust against
variations in the metallicity-dependent cosmic star formation history, and II)
the low mass end is least affected by these variations. This is promising as it
increases our chances to constrain the physics that governs the formation of
these objects.

states -- a prominent example being $M_{T2}$ and its Lorentz-invariant version
$M_2$ -- have been extensively deployed in high-$p_T$ collider searches. A new
range of potential applications at flavour facilities -- where $B$ mesons or
$\tau$ leptons are also pairwise produced -- was recently proposed.
  One general challenge in these decays arises if both the signal parent and
the 'other' parent, often used as a tag, decay semi-invisibly. In such cases,
which notably include semi-leptonic tags, signal identification is generally
hindered by the ensuing lack of knowledge of the signal-parent boost. $M_2$
helps precisely to overcome this challenge, and allows to leverage the
otherwise superior efficiency of semi-leptonic decays.
  Our strategy rests on two novel constraints that can be imposed on $M_2$. The
first is that of the known mass of the decaying-parent mass squared which, in
connection with other constraints, gives rise to $M_{2sB}$. The second is on
the flight direction of the signal parent, often well reconstructed at
facilities with high vertexing capabilities such as Belle II and LHCb. This
constraint gives rise to the $M_{2V}$ variable, that can be used even at
facilities where the collision energy is not known.
  We test these ideas in a decay of great current interest in the context of
the persistent discrepancies in $B$ decays, namely $B \to K \tau \mu$. We find
that a bare-bones application of $M_{2sB}$ leads, alone, to an improvement that
is already halfway between the current approach and the ""truth-level""
semi-leptonic case. Ceteris paribus -- in particular statistics -- our approach
thus makes semi-leptonic tags competitive with fully reconstructed hadronic
tags.

to detect and estimate parameters from these systems. Numerical relativity (NR)
is well suited to study systems with comparable component masses, $m_1\sim
m_2$, whereas small mass ratio (SMR) perturbation theory applies to binaries
where $q=m_2/m_1<< 1$. This work investigates the applicability for NR and SMR
as a function of mass ratio for eccentric non-spinning binary black holes. We
produce $52$ NR simulations with mass ratios between $1:10$ and $1:1$ and
initial eccentricities up to $0.7$. From these we extract quantities like
gravitational wave energy and angular momentum fluxes and periastron advance,
and assess their accuracy. To facilitate comparison, we develop tools to map
between NR and SMR inspiral evolutions of eccentric binary black holes. We
derive post-Newtonian accurate relations between different definitions of
eccentricity. Based on these analyses, we introduce a new definition of
eccentricity based on the (2,2)-mode of the gravitational radiation, which
reduces to the Newtonian definition of eccentricity in the Newtonian limit.
From the comparison between NR simulations and SMR results, we quantify the
unknown next-to-leading order SMR contributions to the gravitational energy and
angular momentum fluxes, and periastron advance. We show that in the comparable
mass regime these contributions are subdominant and higher order SMR
contributions are negligible.

exhaustive and explicit complexity classifications for families that satisfy

small matchings and independent sets in subgraph-closed graph classes
$\mathcal{G}$ as our central objects of study and establish the following crisp
dichotomies as consequences of the Exponential Time Hypothesis: (1) Counting
$k$-matchings in a graph $G\in\mathcal{G}$ is fixed-parameter tractable if and

clump is magnified by ~4-80x. We present time delay predictions and conclusive
evidence that a discrepant clump in the Sunburst Arc, previously claimed to be
a transient, is not variable, thus strengthening the hypothesis that it results
from an exceptionally high magnification. A source plane reconstruction and
analysis of the Sunburst Arc finds its physical size to be 1x2 kpc, and that it
is resolved in three distinct directions in the source plane, 0, 40, and 75
degrees (east of North). We place an upper limit of r <~ 50 pc on the source
plane size of unresolved clumps, and r<~ 32 pc for the LyC clump. Finally, we
report that the Sunburst Arc is likely in a system of two or more galaxies

are unstable to evolution toward $w = 1$ or $w \rightarrow \infty$ in the

can yield ultra-slow expansion but require an expansion law beyond the standard

to facilitate the creation of augmented sports videos by enabling analysts to
directly create visualizations embedded in videos using insights expressed in
natural language. To achieve this goal, we propose a three-step approach - 1)
detecting visualizable entities in the text, 2) mapping these entities into
visualizations, and 3) scheduling these visualizations to play with the video -
and analyzed 155 sports video clips and the accompanying commentaries for
accomplishing these steps. Informed by our analysis, we have designed and

providing rapid design assessments when both the surrogate model and the switch
mechanism for eventually transitioning to the HF model are calibrated properly.
Feedforward neural networks (FNNs) can capture highly nonlinear input-output
mappings, yielding efficient surrogates for aircraft performance factors.
However, FNNs often fail to generalize over the out-of-distribution (OOD)
samples, which hinders their adoption in critical aircraft design optimization.
Through SmOOD, our smoothness-based out-of-distribution detection approach, we
propose to codesign a model-dependent OOD indicator with the optimized FNN
surrogate, to produce a trustworthy surrogate model with selective but credible
predictions. Unlike conventional uncertainty-grounded methods, SmOOD exploits
inherent smoothness properties of the HF simulations to effectively expose OODs
through revealing their suspicious sensitivities, thereby avoiding
over-confident uncertainty estimates on OOD samples. By using SmOOD, only
high-risk OOD inputs are forwarded to the HF model for re-evaluation, leading
to more accurate results at a low overhead cost. Three aircraft performance
models are investigated. Results show that FNN-based surrogates outperform
their Gaussian Process counterparts in terms of predictive performance.
Moreover, SmOOD does cover averagely 85% of actual OODs on all the study cases.
When SmOOD plus FNN surrogates are deployed in hybrid surrogate optimization
settings, they result in a decrease error rate of 34.65% and a computational
speed up rate of 58.36 times, respectively.

role in the early detection of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH).
Clinically, the diagnosis of DDH relies on manual measurements and subjective
evaluation of different anatomical features from pelvic radiographs. This
process is inefficient and error-prone and requires years of clinical
experience. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based system that
automatically detects 14 keypoints from a radiograph, measures three anatomical
angles (center-edge, T\""onnis, and Sharp angles), and classifies DDH hips as
grades I-IV based on the Crowe criteria. Moreover, a novel data-driven scoring
system is proposed to quantitatively integrate the information from the three
angles for DDH diagnosis. The proposed keypoint detection model achieved a mean
(95% confidence interval [CI]) average precision of 0.807 (0.804-0.810). The
mean (95% CI) intraclass correlation coefficients between the center-edge,
Tonnis, and Sharp angles measured by the proposed model and the ground-truth
were 0.957 (0.952-0.962), 0.947 (0.941-0.953), and 0.953 (0.947-0.960),

orthopedic surgeons (p<0.0001). In addition, the mean (95% CI) test diagnostic

criteria for individual angle (0.76 [0.75-0.77]) and orthopedists (0.71

objective DDH diagnosis by leveraging deep learning keypoint detection and

tens of thousands of software security flaws. While executing billions of test

leads to reduced tracing performance. A recent advancement in binary fuzzing
performance is Coverage-guided Tracing (CGT), which brings orders-of-magnitude
gains in throughput by restricting the expense of coverage tracing to only when
new coverage is guaranteed. Unfortunately, CGT suits only a basic block
coverage granularity -- yet most fuzzers require finer-grain coverage metrics:
edge coverage and hit counts. It is this limitation which prohibits nearly all
of today's state-of-the-art fuzzers from attaining the performance benefits of
CGT.
  This paper tackles the challenges of adapting CGT to fuzzing's most
ubiquitous coverage metrics. We introduce and implement a suite of enhancements
that expand CGT's introspection to fuzzing's most common code coverage metrics,
while maintaining its orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional always-on
coverage tracing. We evaluate their trade-offs with respect to fuzzing
performance and effectiveness across 12 diverse real-world binaries (8 open-

near-identical speed to the present block-coverage-only CGT, UnTracer; and
outperforms leading binary- and source-level coverage tracers QEMU, Dyninst,

air and more efficient transportation systems, especially for polluted and

government has appointed PLN, its largest state-owned electricity provider, to
accelerate the preparation of Indonesia's EV infrastructure. With a mission of
providing reliable, accessible, and cost-effective EV charging station
infrastructure throughout the country, the company is prototyping a
location-optimized model to simulate how well its infrastructure design reaches
customers, fulfills demands, and generates revenue. In this work, we study how
PLN could maximize profit by optimally placing EV charging stations in urban
areas by adopting a maximal covering location model. In our experiments, we use
data from Surabaya, Indonesia, and consider the two main transportation modes
for the locals to charge: electric motorcycles and electric cars. Numerical
experiments show that only four charging stations are needed to cover the whole
city, given the charging technology that PLN has acquired. However, consumers'
time-to-travel is exceptionally high (about 35 minutes), which could lead to
poor consumer service and hindrance toward EV technologies. Sensitivity
analysis reveals that building more charging stations could reduce the time but
comes with higher costs due to extra facility installations. Adding layers of
redundancy to buffer against outages or other disruptions also incurs higher
costs but could be an appealing option to design a more reliable and thriving
EV infrastructure. The model can provide insights to decision-makers to devise
the most reliable and cost-effective infrastructure designs to support the
deployment of electric vehicles and much more advanced intelligent
transportation systems in the near future.

guarantees a training loss reduction every time a neuron is added to a layer.
This greatly differs from most binary activated neural networks training
schemes that rely on stochastic gradient descent (circumventing the

the Euler's relation is verified. Adopting a typical mass-formula, we first

(and not in the energy density) due to density dependence of the quark masses.
Additionally, the chemical potential gains a new term as in other models with
quark repulsive interactions. Then, we extend the formalism to the
astrophysically realistic case of charge-neutral three-flavor quark matter in
equilibrium under weak interactions, focusing on two different mass formulae: a
flavor dependent and a flavor blind one. For these two models, we derive the

to enlarge the margin between the distribution of genuine and imposter faces,

assistance in a system with multiple autonomous robots. Each robot is required
to complete independent missions, each defined as a sequence of tasks. While
executing a task, a robot can either operate autonomously or be teleoperated by
the human operator to complete the task at a faster rate. We show that the
problem of creating a teleoperation schedule that minimizes makespan of the
system is NP-Hard. We formulate our problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program,
which can be used to optimally solve small to moderate sized problem instances.
We also develop an anytime algorithm that makes use of the problem structure to
provide a fast and high-quality solution of the operator scheduling problem,
even for larger problem instances. Our key insight is to identify blocking
tasks in greedily-created schedules and iteratively remove those blocks to
improve the quality of the solution. Through numerical simulations, we
demonstrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm as an efficient and scalable
approach that outperforms other greedy methods.

that are otherwise too inflexible to describe the sky data. We identify the
presence of a significant systematic in the calibration data, which is largely

driven by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Domain walls in ferroics and
multiferroics have received tremendous attention recently due to their emergent
properties distinct from their domain counterparts, for example, their high
mobility and controllability, as well as their potential applications in
nanoelectronics. However, it is extremely challenging to detect, visualize and
study the ferro-rotational (FR) domain walls because the FR order, in contrast
to ferromagnetism (FM) and ferroelectricity (FE), is invariant under both the
spatial-inversion and the time-reversal operations and thus hardly couple with
conventional experimental probes. Here, an FR candidate $\mathrm{NiTiO_{3}}$ is
investigated by ultrasensitive electric quadrupole (EQ) second harmonic
generation rotational anisotropy (SHG RA) to probe the point symmetries of the
two degenerate FR domain states, showing their relation by the vertical mirror
operations that are broken below the FR critical temperature. We then visualize
the real-space FR domains by scanning EQ SHG microscopy, and further resolve
the FR domain walls by revealing a suppressed SHG intensity at domain walls. By
taking local EQ SHG RA measurements, we show the restoration of the mirror
symmetry at FR domain walls and prove their unconventional nonpolar nature. Our
findings not only provide a comprehensive insight into FR domain walls, but
also demonstrate a unique and powerful tool for future studies on domain walls
of unconventional ferroics, both of which pave the way towards future
manipulations and applications of FR domain walls.

prospect theory (CPT) utility on an empirical distribution of asset returns. We
show that while CPT utility is not a concave function of the portfolio weights,
it can be expressed as a difference of two functions. The first term is the
composition of a convex function with concave arguments and the second term a
composition of a convex function with convex arguments. This structure allows
us to derive a global lower bound, or minorant, on the CPT utility, which we
can use in a minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm for maximizing CPT
utility. We further show that the problem is amenable to a simple
convex-concave (CC) procedure which iteratively maximizes a local
approximation. Both of these methods can handle small and medium size problems,
and complex (but convex) portfolio constraints. We also describe a simpler
method that scales to larger problems, but handles only simple portfolio
constraints.

crucial to ensure they do not behave in undesired manners, providing offensive
or toxic responses to users. This is not a trivial task as state-of-the-art
chatbot models are trained on large, public datasets openly collected from the
Internet. This paper presents a first-of-its-kind, large-scale measurement of
toxicity in chatbots. We show that publicly available chatbots are prone to
providing toxic responses when fed toxic queries. Even more worryingly, some
non-toxic queries can trigger toxic responses too. We then set out to design
and experiment with an attack, ToxicBuddy, which relies on fine-tuning GPT-2 to
generate non-toxic queries that make chatbots respond in a toxic manner. Our
extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our attack is effective
against public chatbot models and outperforms manually-crafted malicious
queries proposed by previous work. We also evaluate three defense mechanisms
against ToxicBuddy, showing that they either reduce the attack performance at
the cost of affecting the chatbot's utility or are only effective at mitigating
a portion of the attack. This highlights the need for more research from the
computer security and online safety communities to ensure that chatbot models
do not hurt their users. Overall, we are confident that ToxicBuddy can be used
as an auditing tool and that our work will pave the way toward designing more
effective defenses for chatbot safety.

distribution evolves due to diffusive gas exchange. We focus on the comparison
between the size of bubbles determined from images of the foam surface and the
size of bubbles in the bulk foam, determined from Diffuse Transmission
Spectroscopy (DTS). Extracting the bubble size distribution from images of a
foam surface is difficult so we have used three different procedures : manual
analysis, automatic analysis with a customized Python script and machine
learning analysis. Once various pitfalls were identified and taken into
account, all the three procedures yield identical results within error bars.
DTS only allows the determination of an average bubble radius which is
proportional to the photon transport mean free path $\ell^*$. The relation
between the measured diffuse transmitted light intensity and {$\ell^*$}
previously derived for slab-shaped samples of infinite lateral extent does not
apply to the cuboid geometry of the cells used in the microgravity experiment.
A new more general expression of the diffuse intensity transmitted with
specific optical boundary conditions has been derived and applied to determine
the average bubble radius. The temporal evolution of the average bubble radii
deduced from DTS and of the same average radii of the bubbles measured at the
sample surface are in very good agreement throughout the coarsening. Finally,
ground experiments were performed to compare bubble size distributions in a
bulk wet foam and at its surface at times so short that diffusive gas exchange
is insignificant. They were found to be similar, confirming that bubbles seen
at the surface are representative of the bulk foam bubbles.

show that our method can effectively embed an invisible watermark inside the

different GAN architectures, different tasks, and different resolutions of the

considered one of the major scientific goals at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion
Collider (RHIC) towards understanding the nontrivial topological fluctuations
of the Quantum Chromodynamics vacuum. In heavy-ion collisions, the CME is
expected to result in a charge separation phenomenon across the reaction plane,
whose strength could be strongly energy dependent. The previous CME searches
have been focused on top RHIC energy collisions. In this Letter, we present a
low energy search for the CME in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm{NN}}}}=27$
GeV. We measure elliptic flow scaled charge-dependent correlators relative to
the event planes that are defined at both mid-rapidity $|\eta|<1.0$ and at
forward rapidity $2.1 < |\eta|<5.1$. We compare the results based on the
directed flow plane ($\Psi_1$) at forward rapidity and the elliptic flow plane
($\Psi_2$) at both central and forward rapidity. The CME scenario is expected
to result in a larger correlation relative to $\Psi_1$ than to $\Psi_2$, while
a flow driven background scenario would lead to a consistent result for both
event planes. In 10-50\% centrality, results using three different event planes
are found to be consistent within experimental uncertainties, suggesting a flow
driven background scenario dominating the measurement. We obtain an upper limit
on the deviation from a flow driven background scenario at the 95\% confidence
level. This work opens up a possible road map towards future CME search with
the high statistics data from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan Phase-II.

article, we propose to explore the regime of large velocities and large film
sizes. This one is not accessible in experiments classically conducted in the
literature, and allows us to study the regime of large extension and large
extension rates. With our setup, we make soap films up to two meters high by
pulling a horizontal fishing line driven by belts out of a soapy solution at
velocities ranging from 20~cm/s to 250~cm/s. We characterize the thickness
profile of the central part of the film that behaves like a rubber band under
tension. We show that its thickness profile is well described by a static model
in which a homogeneous elastic film is stretched by its own weight. This leads
to an exponential thickness profile with a characteristic length given by a
competition between gravity and surface elasticity. The prefactor is fixed by
the shape and area of the film, governed by the fishing line motion but also by
a continuous extraction of foam film from the lateral menisci, thicker than the
central part, and that progressively invades the film from its lateral
boundaries. The model we propose captures the subtle interplay between gravity,
film elasticity and film extraction and leads to predictions in good agreement
with our experimental data.

introduce a new class of distributions, the Perturbed Unified Skew Normal
(pSUN), which generalizes the SUN class. We show that the new class is
conjugate to any binary regression model, provided that the link function may
be expressed as a scale mixture of Gaussian densities. We discuss in detail the
popular logit case, and we show that, when a logistic regression model is
combined with a Gaussian prior, posterior summaries such as cumulants and
normalizing constant, can be easily obtained, opening the way to
straightforward variable selection procedures. For more general priors, the
proposed methodology is based on a straightforward Gibbs sampler algorithm. We
also claim that, in the p > n case, it shows better performances both in terms
of mixing and accuracy, compared to the existing methods. We illustrate the
performance of the proposal through a simulation study and two real datasets,
one covering the standard case with n >> p and the other related to the p >> n

We specifically address small-scale wind turbines, which are well-suited to
local and compact production of electrical energy on a small scale, such as
urban and rural infrastructure installations. Existing literature concentrates
on large scale wind turbines which run in unobstructed, mostly constant wind
profiles. However urban installations generally must cope with rapidly changing
wind patterns. To bridge this gap, we formulate and implement an RL strategy
using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to optimize the long-term
energy output of a wind turbine. Our MCMC-based RL algorithm is a model-free
and gradient-free algorithm, in which the designer does not have to know the
precise dynamics of the plant and its uncertainties. Our method addresses the
uncertainties by using a multiplicative reward structure, in contrast with
additive reward used in conventional RL approaches. We have shown numerically
that the method specifically overcomes the shortcomings typically associated
with conventional solutions, including, but not limited to, component aging,
modeling errors, and inaccuracies in the estimation of wind speed patterns. Our
results show that the proposed method is especially successful in capturing
power from wind transients; by modulating the generator load and hence the
rotor torque load, so that the rotor tip speed quickly reaches the optimum
value for the anticipated wind speed. This ratio of rotor tip speed to wind
speed is known to be critical in wind power applications. The wind to load
energy efficiency of the proposed method was shown to be superior to two other
methods; the classical maximum power point tracking method and a generator
controlled by deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method.

Finally, we also devise an algorithm to explicitly construct a local policy.

trained infant affect recognition classifiers using both facial and body

extracted with high confidence, a unimodal model trained on facial features
achieved the same optimal performance as multimodal models trained on both
facial and body features. However, multimodal models outperformed unimodal
models when evaluated on the entire dataset. Additionally, model performance
was weakest when predicting an affective state transition and improved after
multiple predictions of the same affective state. These findings emphasize the
benefits of incorporating body features in continuous affect recognition for

the emergent dynamics of neural population activity. These models provide an
essential tool for studying brain function at different scales; however, for
their application to neural populations on large scale, they need to account
for differences between distinct neuron types. The Izhikevich single neuron
model can account for a broad range of different neuron types and spiking
patterns, thus rendering it an optimal candidate for a mean-field theoretic
treatment of brain dynamics in heterogeneous networks. Here, we derive the
mean-field equations for networks of all-to-all coupled Izhikevich neurons with
heterogeneous spiking thresholds. Using methods from bifurcation theory, we
examine the conditions under which the mean-field theory accurately predicts
the dynamics of the Izhikevich neuron network. To this end, we focus on three
important features of the Izhikevich model that are subject here to simplifying
assumptions: (i) spike-frequency adaptation, (ii) the spike reset conditions,
and (iii) the distribution of single-cell spike thresholds across neurons.
  Our results indicate that, while the mean-field model is not an exact model
of the Izhikevich network dynamics, it faithfully captures its different
dynamic regimes and phase transitions. We thus present a mean-field model that
can represent different neuron types and spiking dynamics. The model is
comprised of biophysical state variables and parameters, incorporates realistic
spike resetting conditions, and accounts for heterogeneity in neural spiking
thresholds. These features allow for a broad applicability of the model as well
as for a direct comparison to experimental data.

contamination of the planetary signal by overlapping telluric absorption- and

success of Parker's pioneering theory on an isothermal solar corona, the
realistic solar wind is observed to be non-isothermal, and the decay of its
temperature with radial distance usually can be fitted to a polytropic model.
In this work, we use Parker Solar Probe data from the first nine encounters to
estimate the polytropic index of solar wind protons. The estimated polytropic
index varies roughly between 1.25 and 1.5 and depends strongly on solar wind
speed, faster solar wind on average displaying a smaller polytropic index. We
comprehensively analyze the 1D spherically symmetric solar wind model with
polytropic index $\gamma \in [1,5/3]$. We derive a closed algebraic equation
set for transonic stellar flows, i.e. flows that pass the sound point smoothly.
We show that an accelerating wind solution only exists in the parameter space
bounded by $C_0/C_g < 1$ and $(C_0/C_g)^2 > 2(\gamma-1)$ where $C_0$ and $C_g$
are the surface sound speed and one half of the escape velocity of the star,
and no stellar wind exists for $\gamma > 3/2$. With realistic solar coronal
temperatures, the observed solar wind with $\gamma \gtrsim 1.25$ cannot be
explained by the simple polytropic model. We show that mechanisms such as
strong heating in the lower corona that leads to a thick isothermal layer
around the Sun and large-amplitude Alfv\'en wave pressure are necessary to
remove the constraint in $\gamma$ and accelerate the solar wind to high speeds.

WEEE objects share many key features and therefore can look quite similar, but
their material composition and internal component layout can vary, and thus it

longitudinally-averaged latitude scans taken with the upgraded Very Large Array

ammonia between -60$^{\circ}$ and 60$^{\circ}$ latitude and down to 100 bar. We
constrain the ammonia abundance to be $340.5^{+34.8}_{-21.2}$ ppm

At the equator we find an increase of ammonia with altitude, while the zones

atmosphere is well-mixed. The latitudinal variation in the ammonia abundance
appears to be opposite to that shown at higher altitudes, which supports the

phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory and thereby show that the SDE is
determined by the relative angle between the magnetic field and an effective
anti-symmetric spin-orbit coupling defined from the Ginzburg-Landau
coefficients. The obtained formula offers a convenient criterion to obtain a
finite SDE. We also study the SDE and the nonreciprocal phase transitions of
the $s$-wave and $d$-wave superconductors by using the mean-field theory. It is
established that the sign reversal of the SDE accompanied by the crossover of
the helical superconductivity is a general feature irrespective of the system
details. We study the phase transition lines in the temperature-magnetic-field
phase diagram under the supercurrent, and clarify that the sign reversal of the
SDE generally accompanies the crossings of the transition lines under positive
and negative current directions. Furthermore, the superconducting phases under
the supercurrent even become re-entrant under moderate strength of the electric
current, implying the current-induced first-order phase transitions. Our
findings establish the electric current as the control parameter and the
powerful probe to study the superconducting properties related to the
finite-momentum Cooper pairs.

the number of female IT professionals. This is because there is gender

to suppress the influence of biases, such as the belief that men are more
suited for careers in science and technology than women, and to increase the
choice of careers available to female professionals. To help suppress the
influence of gender bias, we analyzed the relationship between gender and code
reading speed in the field of software development. Certain source codes
require developers to use substantial memory to properly understand them, such
as those with many variables that frequently change values. Several studies
have indicated that the performance of memory differs in males and females. To
test the veracity of this claim, we analyzed the influence of gender on
code-reading speed through an experiment. Pursuant to this, we prepared four
programs that required varied amounts of memory to properly understand them.
Then, we measured the time required by each of the 17 male and 16 female
subjects (33 subjects in total) to comprehend the different programs. The
results suggest that there is no explicit difference between male and female
subjects in this regard, even in the case of programs that require high memory
capacities for proper understanding.

plasmas have been studied extensively over the decades. One prime motivation is
to understand the nonthermal particle acceleration at shocks. Although the
theory of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) has long been the standard for
cosmic-ray acceleration at shocks, plasma physical understanding of particle
acceleration remains elusive. In this review, we discuss nonthermal electron
acceleration mechanisms at quasi-perpendicular shocks, for which substantial
progress has been made in recent years. The discussion presented in this review
is restricted to the following three specific topics. The first is stochastic
shock drift acceleration (SSDA), which is a relatively new mechanism for
electron injection into DSA. The basic mechanism, related in-situ observations
and kinetic simulations results, and how it is connected with DSA will be
discussed. Second, we discuss shock surfing acceleration (SSA) at very high
Mach number shocks relevant to young supernova remnants (SNRs). While the
original proposal under the one-dimensional assumption is unrealistic, SSA has
now been proven efficient by a fully three-dimensional kinetic simulation.
Finally, we discuss the current understanding of the magnetized
Weibel-dominated shock. Spontaneous magnetic reconnection of self-generated
current sheets within the shock structure is an interesting consequence of
Weibel-generated strong magnetic turbulence. We argue that high Mach number
shocks with both Alfven and sound Mach numbers exceeding 20-40 will likely
behave as a Weibel-dominated shock. Despite a number of interesting recent
findings, the relative roles of SSDA, SSA, and magnetic reconnection for
electron acceleration at collisionless shocks and how the dominant particle
acceleration mechanisms change depending on shock parameters remain to be
answered.

optimization, thus allowing to start from a random initialization, which
greatly reduces the risk of non-uniqueness and being trapped in local minima.
Both theoretical and experimental analyses indicates that, given a random
initial model, IFWI is able to converge to the global minimum and produce a
high-resolution image of subsurface with fine structures. In addition,
uncertainty analysis of IFWI can be easily performed by approximating Bayesian
inference with various deep learning approaches, which is analyzed in this
paper by adding dropout neurons. Furthermore, IFWI has a certain degree of

invariant funnel (CIF) for locally Lipschitz nonlinear systems subject to
bounded disturbances. The CIF synthesis refers to a procedure of computing
controlled invariance sets and corresponding feedback gains. In contrast to
existing CIF synthesis methods that compute the CIF with a pre-defined nominal
trajectory, our work aims to optimize the nominal trajectory and the CIF
jointly to satisfy feasibility conditions without relaxation of constraints and
obtain a more cost-optimal nominal trajectory. The proposed work has a
recursive scheme that mainly optimizes two key components: i) trajectory
update; ii) funnel update. The trajectory update step optimizes the nominal
trajectory while ensuring the feasibility of the CIF. Then, the funnel update
step computes the funnel around the nominal trajectory so that the CIF
guarantees an invariance property. As a result, with the optimized trajectory
and CIF, any resulting trajectory propagated from an initial set by the control
law with the computed feedback gain remains within the feasible region around
the nominal trajectory under the presence of bounded disturbances. We validate
the proposed method via a three dimensional path planning problem with obstacle
avoidance.

potentially solve critical problems in fields ranging from cosmology to
astrophysics and fundamental physics. If ultralight bosons exist, they form
clouds around spinning black holes with sizes comparable to their particle
Compton wavelength through superradiance, a well-understood classical wave
amplification process that has been studied for decades. After these clouds
form, they dissipate and emit continuous gravitational waves through the
annihilation of ultralight bosons into gravitons. These gravitons could be
detected with ground-based gravitational-wave detectors using continuous-wave
searches. However, it is conceivable for other continuous-wave sources to mimic
the emission from the clouds, which could lead to false detections. Here we
investigate how one can use continuous waves from clouds formed around known
merger remnants to alleviate this problem. In particular, we simulate a
catalogue of merger remnants that form clouds around them and demonstrate with
select ""golden"" merger remnants how one can perform a Bayesian
cross-verification of the ultralight boson hypothesis that has the potential to
rule out alternative explanations. Our proof-of-concept study suggest that, in
the future, there is a possibility that a merger remnant exists close enough
for us to perform the analysis and test the boson hypothesis if the bosons
exist in the relevant mass range. Future research will focus on building more
sophisticated continuous-wave tools to perform this analysis in practice.

leading-twist quark transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs),
the Sivers and Boer-Mulders functions. While the leading eikonal small-$x$
asymptotics of the quark Sivers function is given by the spin-dependent
odderon, we are interested in revisiting the sub-eikonal correction considered
by us earlier. We first simplify the expressions for both TMDs at small Bjorken
$x$ and then construct small-$x$ evolution equations for the resulting
operators in the large-$N_c$ limit, with $N_c$ the number of quark colors. For
both TMDs, the evolution equations resum all powers of the double-logarithmic
parameter $\alpha_s \, \ln^2 (1/x)$, where $\alpha_s$ is the strong coupling
constant, which is assumed to be small. Solving these evolution equations
numerically (for the Sivers function) and analytically (for the Boer-Mulders
function) we arrive at the following leading small-$x$ asymptotics of these
TMDs at large $N_c$: \begin{align} f_{1 \: T}^{\perp \: NS} (x \ll 1 ,k_T^2) &
= C_O (x, k_T^2) \, \frac{1}{x} + C_1 (x, k_T^2) \, \left( \frac{1}{x}

\notag \end{align} The functions $C_O (x, k_T^2)$, $C_1 (x, k_T^2)$, and $C (x,
k_T^2)$ can be readily obtained in our formalism: they are mildly $x$-dependent
and do not strongly affect the power-of-$x$ asymptotics shown above. The
function $C_O$, along with the $1/x$ factor, arises from the odderon exchange.
For the sub-eikonal contribution to the quark Sivers function (the term with
$C_1$), our result shown above supersedes the one obtained in our previous work
due to the new contributions identified recently.

reward-delay attacks are extremely effective when the goal is simply to
minimize reward. Indeed, we find that even naive baseline reward-delay attacks
are also highly successful in minimizing the reward. Targeted attacks, on the

proposed approaches remain highly effective at achieving the attacker's

parallelism and high computing power bring new solutions to many fields.
However, due to chip process technology, it is difficult to achieve full
coupling of all qubits on a quantum chip, so when compiling a quantum circuit
onto a physical chip, it is necessary to ensure that the two-qubit gate acts on
a pair of coupled qubits by inserting swap gates. It will cause great
additional cost when a large number of swap gates are inserted, leading to the
execution time of quantum circuits longer. In this paper, we designed a way
based on the business to insert swap gates BQA(Busy Qubits Avoid). We exploit
the imbalance of the number of gates on qubits, trying to hide the overhead of
swap gates. At the same time, we also expect swap gates to make as little
negative impact on subsequent two-qubit gates as possible. We have designed a
heuristic function that can take into account both of these points. Compared
with qiskit, the execution time of the circuit optimized by our proposed method
is only 0.5 times that of the qiskit compiled circuit. And when the number of
two-qubit gates is large, it will achieve higher level than general conditions.
This implies higher execution efficiency and lower decoherence error rate.

important issues: (1) how to achieve a reliable, convergent fixed-order series,
and (2) how to reliably estimate the contributions of unknown higher-order
terms. The recursive use of renormalization group equation, together with the
Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC), eliminates the renormalization
scheme-and-scale ambiguities of the conventional pQCD series. The result is a
conformal, scale-invariant series of finite order which also satisfies all of
the principles of the renormalization group. In this paper we propose a novel
Bayesian-based approach to estimate the size of the unknown higher order

show that by using the PMC conformal series, in combination with the Bayesian
analysis, one can consistently achieve high degree of reliability estimates for
the unknown high order terms. Thus the predictive power of pQCD can be greatly
improved. We illustrate this procedure for two pQCD observables: $R_{e^+e^-}$
and $R_\tau$, which are each known up to four loops in pQCD. Numerical analyses
confirm that by using the scale-independent and more convergent PMC conformal

However, translating NE in low-resource setting remains a challenge. In this

find the tag-and-copy mechanism (tag the NEs in the source sentence and copy
them to the target sentence) improves translation in high-resource settings

different parts-of-speech (POS). Interestingly, we find that copy accuracy for

ferromagnetism upto 230 K. Here, we study aspects of scattering mechanism in
Fe3Ge2Te2 single crystals via resistivity, magneto-transport and Hall effect
measurements. The quadratic temperature dependence of electrical resistivity
below the Curie temperature hints towards the dominance of electron-magnon
scattering. A non-saturating positive magnetoresistance (MR) is observed at low
temperatures when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the sample plane.
The linear negative MR at high fields for T < TC corroborates to the
suppression in magnon population due to the damping of spin waves. In the high
temperature regime T > TC,MR can be described by the scattering from spin
fluctuations using the model described by Khosla and Fischer. Isothermal Hall
resistivity curves unveil the presence of anomalous Hall resistivity.
Correlation between MR and side jump mechanism further reveals that the
electron-magnon scattering is responsible for the side jump contribution to the
anomalous Hall effect. Our results provide a clear understanding of the role of
electron-magnon scattering on anomalous Hall effect that rules out its origin
to be the topological band structure.

important words in the sentence, which reflects our eyes staying on each word
in different gaze time or times. Thus, some studies utilize eye-tracking values
to optimize the attention mechanism in deep learning models. But these studies
lack to explain the rationality of this approach. Whether the attention
mechanism possesses this feature of human reading needs to be explored.
[Design/methodology/approach] We conducted experiments on a sentiment
classification task. Firstly, we obtained eye-tracking values from two
open-source eye-tracking corpora to describe the feature of human reading.
Then, the machine attention values of each sentence were learned from a
sentiment classification model. Finally, a comparison was conducted to analyze
machine attention values and eye-tracking values. [Findings] Through
experiments, we found the attention mechanism can focus on important words,
such as adjectives, adverbs, and sentiment words, which are valuable for
judging the sentiment of sentences on the sentiment classification task. It
possesses the feature of human reading, focusing on important words in
sentences when reading. Due to the insufficient learning of the attention
mechanism, some words are wrongly focused. The eye-tracking values can help the
attention mechanism correct this error and improve the model performance.
[Originality/value] Our research not only provides a reasonable explanation for
the study of using eye-tracking values to optimize the attention mechanism, but
also provides new inspiration for the interpretability of attention mechanism.

(SSL), which facilitates various downstream tasks. However, attackers may steal
such SSL models and commercialize them for profit, making it crucial to protect
their Intellectual Property (IP). Most existing IP protection solutions are
designed for supervised learning models and cannot be used directly since they
require that the models' downstream tasks and target labels be known and
available during watermark embedding, which is not always possible in the
domain of SSL. To address such a problem especially when downstream tasks are
diverse and unknown during watermark embedding, we propose a novel black-box
watermarking solution, named SSL-WM, for protecting the ownership of SSL
models. SSL-WM maps watermarked inputs by the watermarked encoders into an
invariant representation space, which causes any downstream classifiers to
produce expected behavior, thus allowing the detection of embedded watermarks.
We evaluate SSL-WM on numerous tasks, such as Computer Vision (CV) and Natural
Language Processing (NLP), using different SSL models, including
contrastive-based and generative-based. Experimental results demonstrate that
SSL-WM can effectively verify the ownership of stolen SSL models in various
downstream tasks. Furthermore, SSL-WM is robust against model fine-tuning and
pruning attacks. Lastly, SSL-WM can also evade detection from evaluated
watermark detection approaches, demonstrating its promising application in
protecting the IP of SSL models.

optimization method (SOM) is proposed for solving full-wave inverse scattering
problems (ISPs). The unrolling network, named SOM-Net, inherently embeds the
Lippmann- Schwinger physical model into the design of network structures. The
SOM-Net takes the deterministic induced current and the raw permittivity image
obtained from back-propagation (BP) as the input. It then updates the induced
current and the permittivity successively in sub-network blocks of the SOM- Net
by imitating iterations of the SOM. The final output of the SOM-Net is the full
predicted induced current, from which the scattered field and the permittivity
image can also be deduced analytically. The parameters of the SOM-Net are
optimized in a supervised manner with the total loss to simultaneously ensure
the consistency of the induced current, the scattered field, and the
permittivity in the governing equations. Numerical tests on both synthetic and
experimental data verify the superior performance of the proposed SOM-Net over
typical ones. The results on challenging examples like scatterers with tough
profiles or high permittivity demonstrate the good generalization ability of
the SOM-Net. With the use of deep unrolling technology, this work builds a
bridge between traditional iterative methods and deep learning methods for
solving ISPs.

policies using dynamic programming for these problems is particularly
challenging since the resulting value functions are non-convex. Moreover, this

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the optimal policy has a four-threshold

criterion. On the other hand, Hirano et al. (2021) showed that the magnetic
effects promote the DCBH formation in metal-free ACHs. We perform a set of
magnetohydrodynamical simulations to investigate star formation in the
magnetized ACHs with metallicities $Z/Z_\odot = 0$, $10^{-5}$, and $10^{-4}$.
Our simulations show that the mass accretion rate onto the protostars becomes
lower in metal-enriched ACHs than that of metal-free ACHs. However, many
protostars form from gravitationally and thermally unstable metal-enriched gas
clouds. Under such circumstances, the magnetic field rapidly increases as the
magnetic field lines wind up due to the spin of protostars. The region with the
amplified magnetic field expands outwards due to the orbital motion of
protostars and the rotation of the accreting gas. The amplified magnetic field
extracts the angular momentum from the accreting gas, promotes the coalescence
of the low-mass protostars, and increases the mass growth rate of the primary
protostar. We conclude that the magnetic field amplification is always realized
in the metal-enriched ACHs regardless of the initial magnetic field strength,
which affects the DCBH formation criterion. In addition, we find a
qualitatively different trend from the previous unmagnetized simulations in
that the mass growth rate is maximal for the extremely metal-poor ACHs with
$Z/Z_\odot = 10^{-5}$.

rheological properties of chocolate undergo evolution as a function of time
under isothermal conditions, a behavior reminiscent of physical aging in
polymeric glasses. Then again, subsequent to cessation of shear flow (or
mechanical rejuvenation), chocolate shows temporal evolution of the rheological
properties, a behavior similar to physical aging in soft glassy materials. In
this work, we evaluate three rheological properties, namely, dynamic moduli,
relaxation time spectrum and characteristic relaxation time of chocolate, and
compare their evolution after thermal as well as mechanical rejuvenation. We
observe that the evolution of the rheological properties subsequent to
mechanical rejuvenation is distinctly different from that of thermal
rejuvenation, wherein the evolution is more gradual in the former case. On the
one hand, this work provides unique insights into how shear affects the

of application possibilities. Most of those previous macroscopic thermal diodes
either resort to nonlinear thermal conductivities with strong temperature

establish a straightforward strategy of passively realizing asymmetric heat
transfer with linear conductive materials. The strategy also introduces a new
interrogative perspective on the design of asymmetric heat transfer utilizing
nonlinear thermal conductivity, correcting the misconception that thermal
rectification is impossible with separable nonlinear thermal conductivity. The
nonlinear perturbation mode can be versatilely engineered to produce an
effective and wide-ranging perturbation in the heat conduction, which imitates
and bypasses intrinsic thermal nonlinearity constraints set by naturally
occurring counterparts. Independent experimental characterizations of surface
thermal radiation and thermal convection verified that the heat exchange

  Stress Materials",,,"10.1122/8.0000558",,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Thixotropy is a phenomenon related to time dependent change in viscosity in
presence or absence of flow. The yield stress, on the other hand, represents
the minimum value of stress above which steady flow can be sustained. In
addition, the yield stress of a material may also change as a function of time.
Both these characteristic features in a material strongly influence the steady
state flow curve of the same. This study aims to understand the interrelation
between thixotropy, yield stress and their relation with the flow curve. In
this regard, we study five thixotropic materials that show yield stress. The
relaxation time of all the five systems shows power-law dependence on aging
time with behaviors ranging from weaker than linear, linear to stronger than
linear. Furthermore, the elastic modulus and yield stress has been observed to
be constant for some systems while time dependent for the others. We also
analyze the experimental behavior through a viscoelastic thixotropic structural
kinetic model that predicts the observed experimental behavior of constant as
well as time-dependent yield stress quite well. These findings indicate that a
non-monotonic steady-state flow curve in a structural kinetic formalism
necessarily leads to time-dependent yield stress, while constant yield stress
is predicted by a monotonic steady-state flow curve with stress plateau in the
limit of low shear rates. The present work, therefore, shows that thixotropic
materials may exhibit either monotonic or non-monotonic flow curves.
Consequently, thixotropic materials may show no yield stress, constant yield
stress or time-dependent yield stress.

this paper, we obtain a suitable penalty shape for our criterion and derive an
associated oracle-type inequality. Finally, the performance of this approach
with different types of K-medians algorithms is compared on a simulation study
with other popular techniques. All studied algorithms are available in the R

linked to $X$ by a finite, birational and bijective morphism. In this paper we
introduce a variant of the seminormalization, suited for real algebraic
varieties, called the R-seminormalization. This object have a universal
property of the same kind of the one of the seminormalization but related to
the real closed points of the variety. In a previous paper, the author studied
the seminormalization of complex algebraic varieties using rational functions
that extend continuously to the closed points for the Euclidean topology. We
adapt here some of those results to the R-seminormalization and we provide
several examples. We also show that the R-seminormalization modifies the
singularities of a real variety by normalizing the purely complex points and
seminormalizing the real ones.

program synthesis in which the programmer provides not only a specification,
but also a high-level ``sketch'' of the program. The sketch is basically a
partial program that models the general intuition of the programmer, while
leaving the low-level details as unimplemented ``holes''. The role of the
synthesis engine is then to fill in these holes such that the completed program
satisfies the desired specification. In this work, we focus on template-based
synthesis of polynomial imperative programs with real variables,
i.e.~imperative programs in which all expressions appearing in assignments,
conditions and guards are polynomials over program variables. While this
problem can be solved in a sound and complete manner by a reduction to the
first-order theory of the reals, the resulting formulas will contain a
quantifier alternation and are extremely hard for modern SMT solvers, even when
considering toy programs with a handful of lines. Moreover, the classical
algorithms for quantifier elimination are notoriously unscalable and not at all
applicable to this use-case.
  In contrast, our main contribution is an algorithm, based on several
well-known theorems in polyhedral and real algebraic geometry, namely Putinar's
Positivstellensatz, the Real Nullstellensatz, Handelman's Theorem and Farkas'
Lemma, which sidesteps the quantifier elimination difficulty and reduces the
problem directly to Quadratic Programming (QP). Alternatively, one can view our
algorithm as an efficient way of eliminating quantifiers in the particular
formulas that appear in the synthesis problem. The resulting QP instances can
then be handled quite easily by SMT solvers. Notably, our reduction to QP is
sound and semi-complete, i.e.~it is complete if polynomials of a sufficiently
high degree are used in the templates...

freedom that can mediate forces between matter particles. One of the common
manifestations of a fifth force in alternative gravity theories is a difference
between the gravitational potentials felt by relativistic and non-relativistic
particles, also known as ""the gravitational slip"". In contrast, a fifth force
between dark matter particles, due to dark sector interaction, does not cause a
gravitational slip, making the latter a possible smoking gun of modified

particles, as in models of coupled quintessence, would also manifest itself as
a measurement of an effective gravitational slip by cosmological surveys of
large-scale structure. This is linked to the fact that redshift-space
distortions due to peculiar motion of galaxies do not provide a measurement of
the true gravitational potential if dark matter is affected by a fifth force.
Hence, it is extremely challenging to distinguish a dark sector interaction
from a modification of gravity with cosmological data alone. Future
observations of gravitational redshift from galaxy surveys can help to break
the degeneracy between these possibilities, by providing a direct measurement

exhibit a power-law solution of the kinetic energy equation close to the
oceanic Garrett \& Munk spectrum, confirming weakly nonlinear wave interactions
as a likely explanation of the observed oceanic spectra. However, finite-size
effects can hinder wave interactions in bounded domains, and observations often
differ from theoretical predictions. This article studies the dynamical regimes
experimentally developing in a stratified fluid forced by internal gravity
waves in a pentagonal domain. We find that by changing the shape and increasing
the dimensions of the domain, finite-size effects diminish and wave turbulence
is observed. In this regime, the temporal spectra decay with a slope compatible
with the Garrett-Munk spectra. Different regimes appear by changing the forcing
conditions, namely discrete wave turbulence, weak wave turbulence, and strongly
stratified turbulence. The buoyancy Reynolds number $Re_b$ marks well the
transitions between the regimes, with weak wave turbulence occurring for
$1\lesssim Re_b\lesssim 3.5$ and strongly non-linear stratified turbulence for

empirical F-discrepancy (GEFD), and study its theoretical properties in
connection with the classical generalized L2-discrepancy in the theory of
uniform designs. These properties allow us to develop a kind of low-GEFD
data-driven subsampling method based on the existing uniform designs. By
simulation examples and a real case study, we show that the proposed
subsampling method is superior to the random sampling method. Moreover, our
method keeps robust under diverse model specifications while other popular

maintain population diversity, exploiting the reward signal when possible and
exploring otherwise. The algorithm combines both the exploitation power of a GA
and the exploration power of NS, while maintaining their simplicity and
elegance. Our experiments show that EyAL outperforms NS in most scenarios,
while being on par with a GA -- and in some scenarios it can outperform both.
EyAL also allows the substitution of the exploiting component (GA) and the
exploring component (NS) with other algorithms, e.g., Evolution Strategy and
Surprise Search, thus opening the door for future research.

undue disparities. However, it is hard for external entities to check for

this paper, we introduce and study a black-box auditing method to detect cases
of distribution shift that lead to a performance disparity of the model across
demographic groups. By extending techniques used in membership and property
inference attacks -- which are designed to expose private information from

is effective, achieving 80--100% AUC-ROC in detecting shifts involving the
underrepresentation of a demographic group in the training set. Researchers and

potential to distinguish artificial agents' capabilities in connected,

share data to build collective environment models, plan collective behavior,
and learn collectively from the shared data that is centrally combined. This
paper presents multiple solutions that allow connected entities to exchange
data. In particular, we propose a new universal communication interface which
uses the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to connect agents

the connection quality in the form of various key performance indicators in
real-time. We compare a variety of approaches that provide the connectivity

occurred sequentially within the observation window of GW detectors), for which
the properties of the progenitor BHs and the remnant BH of the first
coalescence can be reliably inferred from the inspiral portions of the two
mergers. As revealed in our simulation, a test of the BH area law can be
achieved at the significance level of $\gtrsim 3\sigma$ for the hierarchical
triple merger events detected in LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA's O4/O5 runs. If the
hierarchical triple mergers contribute a $\gtrsim 0.1\%$ fraction to the
detected BBHs, a precision test of the BH area law with such systems is
achievable in the near future. Our method also provides an additional criterion
to establish the hierarchical triple merger origin of some candidate events.

characterizes the data placement and delivery strategy of a coded caching

schemes with or without security and privacy are obtained respectively where
the first dedicates to minimizing the transmission load for the first hop and
can achieve the optimal transmission load for the first hop if ignoring the
security and privacy constraints; the second has more flexible parameters on
the memory sizes and a lower subpacketization compared with the first one, and
achieves a tradeoff between subpacketization and transmission loads.

describing the density profile of dark matter haloes. There have been
relatively few comprehensive studies on the dynamical structure of the Einasto
model, mainly because only a limited number of properties can be calculated
analytically. Aims: We want to systematically investigate the photometric and
dynamical structure of the family of Einasto models over the entire model
parameter space. Methods: We used the SpheCow code to explore the properties of
the Einasto model. We systematically investigated how the most important
properties change as a function of the Einasto index $n$. We considered both
isotropic models and radially anisotropic models with an Osipkov-Merritt
orbital structure. Results: We find that all Einasto models with $n<\tfrac12$
have a formal isotropic or Osipkov-Merritt distribution function that is
negative in parts of phase space, and hence cannot be supported by such orbital
structures. On the other hand, all models with larger values of $n$ can be
supported by an isotropic orbital structure, or by an Osipkov-Merritt
anisotropy, as long as the anisotropy radius is larger than a critical value.
This critical anisotropy radius is a decreasing function of $n$, indicating
that less centrally concentrated models allow for a larger degree of radial
anisotropy. Conclusions: Studies of the structure and dynamics of models for
galaxies and dark matter haloes should not be restricted to completely
analytical models. Numerical codes such as SpheCow can help open up the range
of models that are systematically investigated. This applies to the Einasto
model discussed here, but also to other proposed models for dark matter haloes,
including different extensions to the Einasto model.

we propose a novel deep learning based hierarchical beam alignment method that
learns two tiers of probing codebooks (PCs) and uses their measurements to
predict the optimal beam in a coarse-to-fine searching manner. Specifically,
the proposed method first performs coarse channel measurement using the tier-1
PC, then selects a tier-2 PC for fine channel measurement, and finally predicts
the optimal beam based on both coarse and fine measurements. The proposed deep
neural network (DNN) architecture is trained in two steps. First, the tier-1 PC
and the tier-2 PC selector are trained jointly. After that, all the tier-2 PCs
together with the optimal beam predictors are trained jointly. The learned
hierarchical PCs can capture the features of propagation environment. Numerical
results based on realistic ray-tracing datasets demonstrate that the proposed

stopping at almost each household is used for non-recoverable waste collection.
Due to the many stops of the trucks, this strategy causes high fuel
consumption, emissions and noise. These effects can be alleviated by reducing
the number of stops performed by collection vehicles. One possibility consists
of locating collection points throughout the municipality such that residents
bring their waste to their most preferred location. The optimization problem
consists of selecting a subset of candidate locations to place the points such
that each household disposes the waste at the most preferred location. Provided
that the underlying road network is available, we refer to this optimization
problem as the capacitated multi-vehicle covering tour problem on a road
network (Cm-CTP-R). We introduce two mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
formulations: a road-network-based formulation that exploits the sparsity of
the network and a customer-based formulation typically used in vehicle routing
problems (VRP). To solve large instances, we propose a two-phased heuristic
approach that addresses the two subproblems the Cm-CTP-R is built on: a set
covering problem to select the locations and a split-delivery VRP to determine
the routes. Computational experiments on both small and real-life instances
show that the road-network-based formulation is better suited. Furthermore, the
proposed heuristic provides good solutions with optimality gaps below 0.5% and
3.5% for 75% of the small and real-life instances respectively and is able to
find better solutions than the exact method for many real-life instances.

i.e. $c_i^{p}$-$c_i^{n}$ or $\alpha_i^{p}$-$\alpha_i^{n}$; contact-contact or
long range-long range, i.e. $c_i^{p,n}$-$c_j^{p,n}$ or

a modified Crank-Nicolson approximation and the Adams-Bashforth extrapolation
for the temporal discretization, and by applying the Fourier spectral
collocation to the spatial discretization. In addition, two stabilization terms
in different forms are added for the sake of the numerical stability. We
conduct a complete convergence analysis by using the higher-order consistency
estimate for the numerical scheme, combined with the rough error estimate and
the refined estimate. By regarding the numerical solution as a small
perturbation of the exact solution, we are able to justify the discrete
$\ell^\infty$ bound of the numerical solution, as a result of the rough error
estimate. Subsequently, the refined error estimate is derived to obtain the
optimal rate of convergence, following the established $\ell^\infty$ bound of
the numerical solution. Moreover, the energy stability is also rigorously
proved with respect to a modified energy. The proposed scheme can be viewed as
the generalization of the second-order scheme presented in an earlier work, and
the energy stability estimate has greatly improved the corresponding result

(electric) potential $V$, which is taken as a fixed, underlying ``landscape''
on the whole graph.
  We show that there is a strong link between spectral minimal partitions and
infimal partition energies on the one hand, and the infimum $\Sigma$ of the
essential spectrum of the corresponding Schr\""odinger operator on the whole
graph on the other. Namely, we show that for any $k\in\mathbb{N}$, the infimal
energy among all admissible $k$-partitions is bounded from above by $\Sigma$,
and if it is strictly below $\Sigma$, then a spectral minimal $k$-partition
exists. We illustrate our results with several examples of existence and
non-existence of minimal partitions of unbounded and infinite graphs, with and
without potentials.
  The nature of the proofs, a key ingredient of which is a version of Persson's
theorem for quantum graphs, strongly suggests that corresponding results should
hold for Schr\""odinger operator-based partitions of unbounded domains in
Euclidean space.

The rebounding of this dimple is purely inertial but highly sensitive on

non-linear response function and lens vignetting) and the online estimation of
camera exposure time. We conduct more extensive experiments on both public and

the case where unknown parameters appear only in the optimization objective and
not the constraints, for the simple reason that if the constraints were not

propose a novel and practically relevant framework for the Predict+Optimize

We introduce the notion of a correction function, and an additional penalty
term in the loss function, modelling practical scenarios where an estimated
optimal solution can be modified into a feasible solution after the true
parameters are revealed, but at an additional cost. Second, we propose a
corresponding algorithmic approach for our framework, which handles all packing

Mandi and Guns, though with crucial modifications and re-derivations for our
very different setting. Experimentation demonstrates the superior empirical

contaminant absorption in the Earth's atmosphere, the non-stationary stellar
spectrum -- in the form of either Doppler shift or distortion of the line
profile during planetary transits -- creates a non-negligible source of noise
that can alter or even prevent the detection. Recently, significant
improvements have been achieved by using 3D, radiative hydrodynamical (RHD)
simulations for the star and Global Circulation Models (GCM) for the planet
(e.g., Chiavassa & Brogi 2019, Flowers et al. 2019). However, these numerical

the result of the natural coupling at each phase along the planet orbit. With

rate, and thus provides weak constraints on either parameter. We present a
framework that can partially resolve this degeneracy by placing more stringent
constraints on the expected thermospheric temperature. We use the
photoionization code Cloudy within an iterative scheme to compute the
temperature structure of a grid of 1D Parker wind models, including the effects
of radiative heating/cooling, as well as the hydrodynamic effects (expansion
cooling and heat advection). We constrain the parameter space by identifying
models that are not self-consistent through a comparison of the simulated
temperature in the He 10830 $\r{A}$ line-forming region to the temperature
assumed in creating the models. We demonstrate this procedure on models based
on HD 209458 b. By investigating the Parker wind models with an assumed
temperature between 4000 and 12000 K, and a mass-loss rate between $10^{8}$ and
$10^{11}$ g s$^{-1}$, we are able to rule out a large portion of this parameter

2021; Lavrov in Eur. Phys. J. C 82:429, 2022). The approach allows to describe
the deformation procedure for theories with gauge freedom in an explicit and
closed form in terms of special anticanonical transformations of the
Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. The action of the models appears as a local part
of the deformed action which is represented by a functional of the fourth order
in fields. This functional is invariant under original gauge transformations.

user online behaviour for commercial gain. To this day, there is practically no
other way of achieving privacy in said platforms other than renouncing their

social and professional reasons. In this work, we propose a means of balancing
convenience and privacy on FB through obfuscation. We have created MetaPriv, a
tool based on simulating user interaction with FB. MetaPriv allows users to add
noise interactions to their account so as to lead FB's profiling algorithms
astray, and make them draw inaccurate profiles in relation to their interests
and habits. To prove our tool's effectiveness, we ran extensive experiments on
a dummy account and two existing user accounts. Our results showed that, by
using our tool, users can achieve a higher degree of privacy in just a couple
of weeks. We believe that MetaPriv can be further developed to accommodate
other social media platforms and help users regain their privacy, while
maintaining a reasonable level of convenience. To support open science and

have a possible quantum-dipole liquid ground state. To suppress its quantum
fluctuations and reach a possible quantum critical point, we have tuned its
quantum paraelectricity in three ways: (i) 57Fe isotope replacement; (ii)
in-plane compressive strain; and (iii) hydrostatic pressure. It is found that
95% 57Fe replacement and the in-plane strain are more effective to drive its
ground state closer to a critical region by inducing a peak feature in the
temperature dependence of dielectric constant. In contrast, the application of
hydrostatic pressure pushed the system away from the quantum critical point by
gradually suppressing the plateau feature in dielectric constant. Our combined
efforts reveal the potential of the M-type hexaferrites for studying the
quantum critical behaviors.

temporal perspective of online reviews. [Design/methodology/approach] Temporal
characteristics of online reviews (purchase time, review time, and time
intervals between purchase time and review time), similar attributes
clustering, and attribute-level sentiment computing technologies are employed
based on more than 340k smartphone reviews of three products from JD.COM (a
famous online shopping platform in China) to explore the distribution
regularities of user attention and sentiment toward product aspects in this
article. [Findings] The empirical results show that a power-law distribution
can fit user attention to product aspects, and the reviews posted in short time
intervals contain more product aspects. Besides, the results show that the
values of user sentiment of product aspects are significantly higher/lower in
short time intervals which contribute to judging the advantages and weaknesses
of a product. [Research limitations] The paper can't acquire online reviews for
more products with temporal characteristics to verify the findings because of
the restriction on reviews crawling by the shopping platforms.

search-and-rescue (SAR) operations, where the task is to localize and assist
one or several people who are missing, become increasingly relevant. In many
cases the rough location may be known and a UAV can be deployed to explore a
given, confined area to precisely localize the missing people. Due to time and
battery constraints it is often critical that localization is performed as
efficiently as possible. In this work we approach this type of problem by
abstracting it as an aerial view goal localization task in a framework that
emulates a SAR-like setup without requiring access to actual UAVs. In this
framework, an agent operates on top of an aerial image (proxy for a search
area) and is tasked with localizing a goal that is described in terms of visual
cues. To further mimic the situation on an actual UAV, the agent is not able to
observe the search area in its entirety, not even at low resolution, and thus
it has to operate solely based on partial glimpses when navigating towards the
goal. To tackle this task, we propose AiRLoc, a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based model that decouples exploration (searching for distant goals) and
exploitation (localizing nearby goals). Extensive evaluations show that AiRLoc
outperforms heuristic search methods as well as alternative learnable
approaches, and that it generalizes across datasets, e.g. to disaster-hit areas
without seeing a single disaster scenario during training. We also conduct a
proof-of-concept study which indicates that the learnable methods outperform
humans on average. Code and models have been made publicly available at

previously. However, the varying ELR may obscure certain characteristics of the
intrinsic loss landscape structure. In this work, we investigate the properties
of training scale-invariant neural networks directly on the sphere using a
fixed ELR. We discover three regimes of such training depending on the ELR
value: convergence, chaotic equilibrium, and divergence. We study these regimes
in detail both on a theoretical examination of a toy example and on a thorough
empirical analysis of real scale-invariant deep learning models. Each regime
has unique features and reflects specific properties of the intrinsic loss
landscape, some of which have strong parallels with previous research on both
regular and scale-invariant neural networks training. Finally, we demonstrate
how the discovered regimes are reflected in conventional training of normalized
networks and how they can be leveraged to achieve better optima.

are associated with the young stellar clusters. However, the observations of
filamentary structures within hubs at distances require a high angular
resolution that limits the number of such studies conducted so far. The
integral shaped filament of the Orion A molecular cloud is noted for harbouring
several hubs within which no filamentary structures have been observed so far.
The goal of our study is to investigate the nature of the filamentary
structures within one of these hubs, which is the chemically rich hub OMC-2 FIR
4, and to analyse their emission with high density and shock tracers. We
observed the OMC-2 FIR 4 proto-cluster using Band 6 of the ALMA in Cycle 4 with
an angular resolution of ~0.26""(100 au). We analysed the spatial distribution
of dust, the shock tracer SiO, and dense gas tracers (i.e., CH$_{3}$OH, CS, and
H$^{13}$CN). We also studied gas kinematics using SiO and CH3OH maps. Our
observations for the first time reveal interwoven filamentary structures within
OMC-2 FIR 4 that are probed by several tracers. Each filamentary structure is
characterised by a distinct velocity as seen from the emission peak of
CH$_{3}$OH lines. They also show transonic and supersonic motions. SiO is
associated with filaments and also with multiple bow-shock features. In
addition, for the first time, we reveal a highly collimated SiO jet

VLA15. Our study shows that multi-scale observations of these regions are
crucial for understanding the accretion processes and flow of material that

network parameters or control functions entering into a continuous-time dynamic
system to achieve improved solution accuracy in satisfying the interim point
constraints placed on the performance output variables. The proposed approach
is to linearise the dynamics around the baseline values of its arguments, and
then to solve for the corrective input required to transfer the perturbed
trajectory to precisely known or desired values at specific time points, i.e.,
the interim points. Depending on the type of decision variables to adjust,
parameter correction and control function correction methods are developed.
These incremental correction methods can be utilised as a means to compensate
for the prediction errors of pre-trained neural networks in real-time
applications where high accuracy of the prediction of dynamical systems at
prescribed time points is imperative. In this regard, the online update
approach can be useful for enhancing overall targeting accuracy of
finite-horizon control subject to point constraints using a neural policy.
Numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in an
application to a powered descent problem at Mars.

In
condensed matter, it characterises conventional continuous phase transitions
but is absent at topological phase transitions such as the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition - due in this case to the
expected norm of the $U(1)$ order parameter vanishing in the thermodynamic
limit. Symmetry breaking has been observed, however, in many different BKT
experiments. Examples include recent experiments on superconducting films and
the seminal work on two-dimensional arrays of Josephson junctions. While the
inaccessibility of the thermodynamic limit of the expected norm partially
explains this paradox in finite systems, the dynamical symmetry-breaking
framework required for the superconducting film and Josephson-junction array
remains unresolved. Here we provide this by introducing the broader concept of
general symmetry breaking. This encompasses both spontaneous symmetry breaking
and the experimental anomalies by allowing the expected norm of the order
parameter to go to zero in the thermodynamic limit, provided its directional
phase fluctuations are asymptotically smaller, returning zero following the
thermodynamic and then long-time limits. This explicitly demonstrates that the
order parameter arbitrarily chooses a well-defined direction in the
thermodynamic limit, reflecting experimental $U(1)$ phase fluctuations being
negligible compared to the expected norm at arbitrarily large system size. Our
results provide a model for symmetry-restoring timescales across a diverse
array of experimental systems. We suggest experiments on Josephson junctions
and magnetic and colloidal films.

evaluating the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation performance. Among
numerous bounds for DOA estimation, the local Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is only
tight asymptotically. By contrast, the existing global tight Ziv-Zakai bound
(ZZB) is appropriate for evaluating the single source estimation only. In this
paper, we derive an explicit ZZB applicable for evaluating hybrid
coherent/incoherent multiple sources DOA estimation. It is first shown that, a
straightforward generalization of ZZB from single source estimation to multiple
sources estimation cannot keep the bound valid in the a priori performance
region. To derive a global tight ZZB, we then introduce order statistics to
describe the change of the a priori distribution of DOAs caused by ordering
process during the MSE calculation. The derived ZZB is for the first time
formulated as a function of coherent coefficients between coherent sources, and
reveals the relationship between the MSE convergency in the a priori
performance region and the number of sources. Moreover, the derived ZZB also
provides a unified tight bound for both overdetermined and underdetermined DOA
estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the obvious advantages of the
derived ZZB over the CRB on evaluating and predicting the estimation
performance for multiple sources DOA.

usually consists in solving non-convex optimisation problems that are
high-dimensional and subject to large-scale data. Here, momentum-based
stochastic optimisation algorithms have become especially popular in recent
years. The stochasticity arises from data subsampling which reduces
computational cost. Moreover, both, momentum and stochasticity are supposed to
help the algorithm to overcome local minimisers and, hopefully, converge
globally. Theoretically, this combination of stochasticity and momentum is
badly understood.
  In this work, we propose and analyse a continuous-time model for stochastic
gradient descent with momentum. This model is a piecewise-deterministic Markov
process that represents the particle movement by an underdamped dynamical
system and the data subsampling through a stochastic switching of the dynamical
system. In our analysis, we investigate longtime limits, the
subsampling-to-no-subsampling limit, and the momentum-to-no-momentum limit. We
are particularly interested in the case of reducing the momentum over time:
intuitively, the momentum helps to overcome local minimisers in the initial
phase of the algorithm, but prohibits fast convergence to a global minimiser
later. Under convexity assumptions, we show convergence of our dynamical system
to the global minimiser when reducing momentum over time and let the
subsampling rate go to infinity.
  We then propose a stable, symplectic discretisation scheme to construct an
algorithm from our continuous-time dynamical system. In numerical experiments,
we study our discretisation scheme in convex and non-convex test problems.
Additionally, we train a convolutional neural network to solve the CIFAR-10
image classification problem. Here, our algorithm reaches competitive results
compared to stochastic gradient descent with momentum.

employing a multi-level approach, computational complexity is reduced, and
various levels of coordination and flexibilities are implemented. We conclude
the work with a case study for a representative rural grid in Germany, in which
we observe high economic potential in the flexible operation of buildings,
majorly thanks to better integration of photovoltaics. Across all paradigms
barring a best-case benchmark, grid reinforcement based on a mix of passive and

flexibilities and coordination, as their combination reduces the peaks to the
extent of completely avoiding grid reinforcement. The presented framework can

optimizes the adversarial perturbations without any extra training efforts for
auxiliary networks on training data. Our new attack method is proposed based on
the observation that highly universal adversarial perturbations tend to be more
transferable for targeted attacks. Therefore, we propose to make the
perturbation to be agnostic to different local regions within one image, which
we called as self-universality. Instead of optimizing the perturbations on
different images, optimizing on different regions to achieve self-universality
can get rid of using extra data. Specifically, we introduce a feature
similarity loss that encourages the learned perturbations to be universal by
maximizing the feature similarity between adversarial perturbed global images
and randomly cropped local regions. With the feature similarity loss, our
method makes the features from adversarial perturbations to be more dominant
than that of benign images, hence improving targeted transferability. We name
the proposed attack method as Self-Universality (SU) attack. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SU can achieve high success rates for
transfer-based targeted attacks. On ImageNet-compatible dataset, SU yields an

widely used to model behavioral and neural data, an approach we call

for basic cognitive functions. We propose that arguing about the successes and
failures of a restricted set of current ANNs is the wrong approach to assess
the promise of neuroconnectionism. Instead, we take inspiration from the
philosophy of science, and in particular from Lakatos, who showed that the core
of scientific research programmes is often not directly falsifiable, but should
be assessed by its capacity to generate novel insights. Following this view, we
present neuroconnectionism as a cohesive large-scale research programme
centered around ANNs as a computational language for expressing falsifiable
theories about brain computation. We describe the core of the programme, the
underlying computational framework and its tools for testing specific
neuroscientific hypotheses. Taking a longitudinal view, we review past and
present neuroconnectionist projects and their responses to challenges, and
argue that the research programme is highly progressive, generating new and
otherwise unreachable insights into the workings of the brain.

COVID-19 using voice data recordings spontaneously provided by the general
population (voice recordings and a short questionnaire) via their personal
devices. The novelty of this work is in the development of a deep learning
model for the identification of COVID-19 patients from voice recordings.
Methods: We used the Cambridge University dataset consisting of 893 audio
samples, crowd-sourced from 4352 participants that used a COVID-19 Sounds app.
Voice features were extracted using a Mel-spectrogram analysis. Based on the
voice data, we developed deep learning classification models to detect positive
COVID-19 cases. These models included Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We compared their predictive power to
baseline classification models, namely Logistic Regression and Support Vector

features achieved the highest accuracy (89%,) with a sensitivity and
specificity of respectively 89% and 89%, The results achieved with the proposed

Deep learning can detect subtle changes in the voice of COVID-19 patients with

strong decrease in the efficiency, up to complete suppression of HHG with
energies of quanta above the bandgap for the smallest dots, whereas the
intensity of below bandgap harmonics remains weakly affected by the dot size.
In addition, it is observed that the ratio between suppression of above gap
harmonics versus below gap harmonics increases with driving wavelength. We
suggest that the reduction in the dot size below the classical electron
oscillatory radius and the corresponding off the dots wall scattering limits
the maximum acceleration by the laser field. Moreover, this scattering leads to
a chaotization of motion, causing dephasing and a loss of coherence, therefore
suppressing the efficiency of the emission of highest-order harmonics. Our
results demonstrate a new regime of intense laser-nanoscale solid interaction,
intermediate between the bulk and single molecule response.

models in sequential recommendation. In our study, an interesting phenomenon is
observed that overfitting is temporary. When the model scale is increased, the
trend of the performance firstly ascends, then descends (i.e., overfitting) and
finally ascends again, which is named as double ascent in this paper. We
therefore raise an assumption that a considerably larger model will generalise
better with a higher performance. In an extreme case to infinite-width,
performance is expected to reach the limit of this specific structure.
Unfortunately, it is impractical to directly build a huge model due to the
limit of resources. In this paper, we propose the Overparameterised Recommender
(OverRec), which utilises a recurrent neural tangent kernel (RNTK) as a
similarity measurement for user sequences to successfully bypass the
restriction of hardware for huge models. We further prove that the RNTK for the
tied input-output embeddings in recommendation is the same as the RNTK for
general untied input-output embeddings, which makes RNTK theoretically suitable
for recommendation. Since the RNTK is analytically derived, OverRec does not
require any training, avoiding physically building the huge model. Extensive
experiments are conducted on four datasets, which verifies the state-of-the-art
performance of OverRec.

For given initial velocity and impact parameter, back-reaction from the scalar
field modifies the scattering angle by an amount $\propto\! Q^2$, which we
calculate numerically for a large sample of orbits (neglecting the
gravitational self-force). Our results probe both strong-field and field-weak
scenarios, and in the latter case we find a good agreement with
post-Minkowskian expressions. The scalar-field self-force has a component
tangent to the four-velocity that exchanges particle's mass with scalar-field
energy, and we also compute this mass exchange as a function along the orbit.
The expressions we derive for the scattering angle (in terms of certain
integrals of the self-force along the orbit) can be used to obtain the
gravitational self-force correction to the angle in the physical problem of a
binary black hole with a large mass ratio. We discuss the remaining steps

property of LSO is that the structure and symmetry of the original
nonorthogonal basis states are preserved to the greatest extent possible, which
prompts us to study the role of LSO in identifying the hierarchical relations
of resource states. Notably, we reveal that the maximally coherent states turn
into the states with maximal superposition with the help of LSO: in other
words, they are equivalent under the action of symmetric orthogonalization. Our
results facilitate further connections between coherence and superposition,
where LSO is the main tool.

Riemannian manifold or a Gromov hyperbolic uniform graph, boundary rigidity is

well-being. AT, or simply fat, stores energy in the form of lipids.
Malnourishment may result in excessive or depleted adiposity. Although previous
studies showed a correlation between the amount of AT and perinatal outcome,
prenatal assessment of AT is limited by lacking quantitative methods. Using
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 3D fat- and water-only images of the entire
fetus can be obtained from two point Dixon images to enable AT lipid
quantification. This paper is the first to present a methodology for developing
a deep learning based method for fetal fat segmentation based on Dixon MRI. It
optimizes radiologists' manual fetal fat delineation time to produce annotated
training dataset. It consists of two steps: 1) model-based semi-automatic fetal
fat segmentations, reviewed and corrected by a radiologist; 2) automatic fetal
fat segmentation using DL networks trained on the resulting annotated dataset.
Three DL networks were trained. We show a significant improvement in
segmentation times (3:38 hours to < 1 hour) and observer variability (Dice of
0.738 to 0.906) compared to manual segmentation. Automatic segmentation of 24
test cases with the 3D Residual U-Net, nn-UNet and SWIN-UNetR transformer
networks yields a mean Dice score of 0.863, 0.787 and 0.856, respectively.
These results are better than the manual observer variability, and comparable
to automatic adult and pediatric fat segmentation. A radiologist reviewed and
corrected six new independent cases segmented using the best performing
network, resulting in a Dice score of 0.961 and a significantly reduced
correction time of 15:20 minutes. Using these novel segmentation methods and
short MRI acquisition time, whole body subcutaneous lipids can be quantified
for individual fetuses in the clinic and large-cohort research.

several internal cavities (Xe1 through Xe4) were observed experimentally
through X-ray crystallography experiments. At a functional level, they were
linked to ligand storage and internal ligand diffusion. Barriers for ligand
diffusion and relative stabilization energies for the ligand in the initial and
final pocket linking a transition may differ depending on the occupation state
of the remaining pockets. This is considered in the present work from biased
(umbrella sampling) and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. It is found
that the energetics of a particular ligand migration pathway may depend on the
direction in which the transition is followed (forward or reverse) and the
occupation state of other cavities. Furthermore, the barrier for a particular
transition can depend in a non-additive fashion on the occupation of either
cavity A or B or simultaneous occupation of both cavities, A and B. Multiple
repeats for the Xe1$\rightarrow$Xe2 transition reveals that the activation
barrier is a distribution of barrier heights rather than one single value which
is confirmed by a distribution of transition times for the same transition from
unbiased simulations. Dynamic cross correlation maps for this transition
demonstrate that correlated motions occur between adjacent residues or through
space. Residue Phe138 is characterized as a gate between Xe1 and Xe2 for the
Xe1$\rightarrow$Xe2 transition. It is also found that the volumes of the
internal cavities vary along the diffusion pathway which points towards dynamic
communication between the ligand and the protein. The findings are discussed in

give access to accidental correlations between separated time intervals.
Moreover, the approach is easily applicable to a modular array of arbitrary

investigation on whether topological properties of the bulk materials are
linked to the occurrence of edge modes. The subwavelength solutions being
described by a periodically parameterized time-periodic linear ordinary
differential equation $\left\{\frac{d}{dt}X = A_\alpha(t)X\right\}_{\alpha \in
\mathbb{T}^d}$, we put ourselves in the general setting of periodically
parameterized time-periodic linear ordinary differential equations and
introduce a way to (topologically) classify a Floquet normal form $F,~P$ of the
associated fundamental solution $\left\{X_\alpha(t) =
P(\alpha,t)\exp(tF_\alpha)\right\}_{\alpha \in \mathbb{T}^d}$. This is achieved
by analysing the topological properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
the monodromy matrix $X_\alpha(T)$ and the Lyapunov transformation
$P(\alpha,t)$. The corresponding topological invariants can then be applied to
the setting of Floquet metamaterials. In this paper these general results are
considered in the case of honeycomb Floquet metamaterials. We provide two
interesting examples of topologically non-trivial time-modulated honeycomb
structures.

a magnetized dusty plasma consisting of electrons and ions, with distribution
of momenta described by a Maxwellian function. The dust particles are
considered to be immobile and have all the same size; they are electrically
charged by absorption of plasma particles via inelastic collisions and by
photoionization. We numerically solve the dispersion relation and calculate the
components of group velocity (along and transverse to the magnetic field) for
the normal modes, namely the compressional and shear Alfv\'en waves (CAW and
SAW). The results show that the direction of the group velocity of CAWs is
greatly modified with the wave-vector direction. On the other hand, SAWs will
present group velocity propagating practically along the magnetic field. The
changes in dust parameters, such as number density and equilibrium electrical
charge, may significantly change the waves' characteristics. It is seen that
for sufficiently high dust to ion number density ratio, the SAWs may present
perpendicular group velocity propagating in opposite direction to the
perpendicular phase velocity, in a small interval of wavenumber values; we also
notice that this interval may change, or even vanish, when the flux of
radiation incident on the dust is altered, changing the equilibrium electrical
charge of the grains.

minimized using quantum technology. To derive at a QUBO model that is also

further improvement with time in the case of long-term BCI studies? In this
study, we investigated the impact of long-term recordings on motor imagery
decoding from two main perspectives: model requirements regarding dataset size
and potential for patient adaptation. We evaluated the multilinear model and
two deep learning (DL) models on a long-term BCI and Tetraplegia NCT02550522

a tetraplegic patient. In the experiment, a participant executed 3D virtual

computational experiments in which training datasets were increased or
translated to investigate the relationship between models' performance and
different factors influencing recordings. Our analysis showed that adding more
data to the training dataset may not instantly increase performance for
datasets already containing 40 minutes of the signal. DL decoders showed
similar requirements regarding the dataset size compared to the multilinear
model while demonstrating higher decoding performance. Moreover, high decoding
performance was obtained with relatively small datasets recorded later in the

diffusion coefficient inferred from B/C is significantly higher than the latest

of the F production cross sections. In this work, we give a careful test to
this interpretation. We consider four different cross-section parametric
models. Each model is constrained by the latest cross-section data. We perform
combined fits to the B/C, F/Si, and cross-section data with the same
propagation framework. Two of the cross-section models have good overall
goodness of fit with $\chi^2/n_{d.o.f.}\sim1$. However, the goodness of fit of
the cross-section part is poor with $\chi^2_{\rm{cs}}/n_{\rm{cs}}\gtrsim2$ for
these models. The best-fitted F production cross sections are systematically
larger than the measurements, while the fitted cross sections for B production
are systematically lower than the measurements. This indicates that the F
anomaly can hardly be interpreted by neither the random errors of the
cross-section measurements nor the differences between the existing
cross-section models. We then propose that the spatially dependent diffusion
model could help to explain B/C and F/Si consistently. In this model, the
average diffusion coefficient of the Ne-Si group is expected to be larger than
that of the C-O group.

appropriately interpolates between Boltzmann's and Gibbs' entropies, and has
recently been argued to provide a useful measure of out-of-equilibrium
thermodynamic entropy. Here we study the mathematical properties of
observational entropy from an information-theoretic viewpoint, making use of
recently strengthened forms of the monotonicity property of quantum relative
entropy. We present new bounds on observational entropy applying in general, as
well as bounds and identities related to sequential and post-processed
measurements. A central role in this work is played by what we call the
``coarse-grained'' state, which emerges from the measurement's statistics by
Bayesian retrodiction, without presuming any knowledge about the ``true''
underlying state being measured. The degree of distinguishability between such
a coarse-grained state and the true (but generally unobservable) one is shown
to provide upper and lower bounds on the difference between observational and
von Neumann entropies.

minimize the expectation of slow-time ambiguity function (STAF) over
range-Doppler bins. From a technical point of view, this is actually an
optimization problem of a non-convex quartic function with constant modulus
constraints (CMC). In this paper, we proposed a novel method to design a

put forward an iterative algorithm within an alternating direction penalty
method (ADPM) framework. In each iteration, this problem is split into two
sub-problems by introducing auxiliary variables. In the first sub-problem, we
solved the convex problem directly with a closed-form solution, then utilized
the Riemannian trust region (RTR) algorithm in the second sub-problem.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other

G106.3+2.7 are among candidates for the ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray
counterparts published by LHAASO. Although the centroid of the extended source,
LHAASO J2226+6057, deviates from the pulsar's position by about $0.3^\circ$,
the source partially covers the PWN. Therefore, we cannot totally exclude the
possibility that a part of the UHE emission comes from the PWN. Previous
studies mainly focus on whether the SNR is a PeVatron, while neglecting the
energetic PWN. Here, we explore the possibility of the Boomerang Nebula being a
PeVatron candidate by studying its X-ray radiation. By modelling the diffusion
of relativistic electrons injected in the PWN, we fit the radial profiles of
the X-ray surface brightness and the photon index. The solution with a magnetic
field $B=140\mu$G can well reproduce the observed profiles and implies a severe
suppression of IC scattering of electrons. Therefore, a proton component need
be introduced to account for the UHE emission, in light of recent LHAASO's
measurement on Crab Nebula, if future observations reveal part of the UHE
emission originating from the PWN. In this sense, Boomerang Nebula would be a
hadronic PeVatron.

time evolution of the abundances and the ratio $D^* /D$. They are approximately
constant in time. Also, assuming a Bjorken type cooling and using an empirical
relation between the freeze-out temperature and the central multiplicity
density, we estimate $D^* /D$ as a function of $ dN /d \eta (\eta =0)$, which
represents the system size. We find that, while the number of $D^*$'s and $D$'s
grows significantly with the system size, their ratio remains approximately
constant. This prediction can be compared with future experimental data. Our
results suggest that the charm meson interactions in the hadron gas do not
change their multiplicities and consequently these mesons are close to chemical

such that the corresponding local Arthur packets all contain a given
representation of the split classical groups $G_n=Sp_{2n}, SO_{2n+1}$ over a
non-Archimedean local field of characteristic zero. We show that there exist a
pair of elements in this set which are the unique maximal and minimal elements
under various orderings. As an application, we prove the closure ordering
conjecture on the local $L$-parameters of representations in local Arthur
packets of $G_n$, namely, given any representation $\pi$ in a local Arthur
packet $\Pi_{\psi}$, the closure of the local $L$-parameter of $\pi$ in the
Vogan variety must contain the local $L$-parameter corresponding to $\psi$.
This conjecture is inspired by the work of Adams, Barbasch, and Vogan, and
Cunningham et al. on ABV-packets. Its ABV-analogue has been proved by
Cunningham et al. Our result provides evidence for the coincidence of the local
Arthur packets with the ABV-packets as conjectured by Cunningham et al. in
[CFMMX22, Section 8.3, Conjecture 1]. Our key ingredients to overcome the
difficulty which lies in the nontrivial intersections of local Arthur packets
are the operators developed in [HLL22] and a reduction to the unique maximal
element above. The closure ordering conjecture reveals a very interesting
geometric nature of local Arthur packets and is expected to have many important
implications. We show that it implies the Enhanced Shahidi's Conjecture for
general quasi-split connected reductive groups, under certain reasonable
assumptions. We verify these assumptions for $G_n$, giving a new proof of the
Enhanced Shahidi's Conjecture. As a byproduct of the proof of the closure
ordering conjecture, we give new algorithms to determine whether a given
representation is of Arthur type, which have their own interests and
theoretical importance.

Arrhenius dependence on temperature. The potential energy profile responsible
for the activation process increases with tracer size, tracer bead interaction,

controller is insensitive to the gain overestimation or large sampling time,
which benefits the gain tuning and sampling time setting in practice. The

understood on the basis of exact anomalies. These anomalies arise when
staggered fermions are coupled to gravity which can be accomplished by
replacing them by discrete K\""{a}hler-Dirac fermions. We first show the
existence of a perturbative anomaly in even dimensions which breaks an exact
$U(1)$ symmetry of the massless theory down to $Z_4$. If we attempt to gauge
this $Z_4$ symmetry we find a 't Hooft anomaly which can only be cancelled for
multiples of two K\""{a}hler-Dirac fields. This result is consistent with the
cancellation of a further mixed non-perturbative 't Hooft anomaly between the
global $Z_4$ and a reflection symmetry. In four dimensional flat space,
theories of two staggered fields yield eight Dirac or sixteen Majorana fermions
in the continuum limit and this critical number of fermions agrees with results
in condensed matter theory literature on the fermion content required to gap
boundary fermions in $4+1$ dimensional topological superconductors. It is also
consistent with constraints stemming from the cancellation of spin-$Z_4$
anomalies of Weyl fermions. Indeed, cancellation of 't Hooft anomalies is a
necessary requirement for symmetric mass generation and this result gives a
theoretical explanation of recent numerical work on the phase diagram of
interacting staggered fermions. As an application of these ideas we construct a
lattice model whose low energy continuum limit is conjectured to yield the
Pati-Salam GUT theory.

morphs to an optimal design as it is pressurised to move in different

a set of principles and thus can be adapted to other applications. We also

only provides the definite and limited tensor low-rank prior in the FFT domain,
heavily reliant upon how closely the data and the FFT domain match up. By
generalizing the FFT into an arbitrary unitary transformation of the

introduce a flexible model based on TTNN with the ability to exploit the tensor
low-rank prior of a transformed domain in a larger transformation space and
elaborately design an iterative optimization algorithm based on the alternating

two-body hyperbolic encounters, working order by order in the mass ratio
(assumed small) but with no recourse to a weak-field approximation. This, in
turn, can inform ongoing efforts to construct an accurate description of the
general-relativistic binary dynamics via an effective-one-body description or
other approaches. Existing self-force methods are to a large extent specialised
to bound, inspiral orbits. Here we derive the first-order conservative
self-force correction to the scattering angle, show its agreement with recent
post-Minkowsian results, and develop a technique for (numerical) self-force
calculations that can efficiently tackle scatter orbits. In the method, the
metric perturbation is reconstructed from a Hertz potential that satisfies
(mode-by-mode) a certain inhomogeneous version of the Teukolsky equation. The
crucial ingredient in this formulation are certain jump conditions that the
(multipole modes of the) Hertz potential must satisfy along the worldline of
the small body's orbit. We present a closed-form expression for these jumps,
for an arbitrary geodesic orbit in Schwarzschild spacetime. To begin developing
the numerical infrastructure, a scalar-field evolution code on a Schwarzschild
background (in 1+1D) is developed. Following this, results for the conservative
scalar self-force corrections to the scatter angle are calculated. We continue
by constructing a Teukolsky evolution code on a Schwarzschild background. This
produces numerically unstable solutions due to unphysical homogeneous solutions
of the Teukolsky equation at the horizon and null infinity being seeded by
numerical error. This can be resolved by a change of variables to a
Regge-Wheeler-like field. We then present a full numerical implementation of
this method for circular and scatter orbits in Schwarzschild.

used. There have been a range of recent demonstrations of automated tuning of
various QD parameters such as coarse gate ranges, global state topology (e.g.
single QD, double QD), charge, and tunnel coupling with a variety of methods.
Here, we demonstrate an intuitive, reliable, and data-efficient set of tools
for automated global state and charge tuning in a framework deemed
physics-informed tuning (PIT). The first module of PIT is an action-based
algorithm that combines a machine learning (ML) classifier with physics
knowledge to navigate to a target global state. The second module uses a series
of one-dimensional measurements to tune to a target charge state by first
emptying the QDs of charge, followed by calibrating capacitive couplings, and
navigating to the target charge state. The success rate for the action-based
tuning consistently surpasses $95~\%$ on both simulated and experimental data
suitable for off-line testing. The success rate for charge setting is
comparable when testing with simulated data, at $95.5(5.4)~\%$, and only
slightly worse for off-line experimental tests, with an average of
$89.7(17.4)~\%$ (median $97.5~\%$). It's noteworthy that the high performance
is demonstrated both on data from samples fabricated in an academic cleanroom
as well as on an industrial 300 mm process line, further underlining the
device-agnosticity of PIT. Together, these tests on a range of simulated and

the nonlinear nature of the network is captured, and the behaviour of flexible
units is constrained. This letter demonstrates, using a small ADN example with
four flexible units and considering only nonlinearities from the network, that
reaching the full P-Q flexibility areas would require perfect coordination of
units and high ramping rates. Without these requirements, the P-Q areas become
nonconvex. Thus, if the effects of nonlinearities and nonconvexities are
ignored, existing approaches in the literature can result in overestimation of
ADN flexibility and give rise to impractical solutions, hampering coordination
between transmission and distribution system operators.

involve minutiae based patch extraction, multiple feature extraction steps and
an expensive matching stage, which make the corresponding approach time

Diffusion models can represent highly-expressive multimodal distributions and
exhibit proper gradients over the entire space due to their score-matching
training objective. Learning costs as diffusion models allows their seamless
integration with other costs into a single differentiable objective function,
enabling joint gradient-based motion optimization. In this work, we focus on
learning SE(3) diffusion models for 6DoF grasping, giving rise to a novel
framework for joint grasp and motion optimization without needing to decouple
grasp selection from trajectory generation. We evaluate the representation
power of our SE(3) diffusion models w.r.t. classical generative models, and we
showcase the superior performance of our proposed optimization framework in a

is used when multiple candidates need to be elected. The complexity of these
systems has made it difficult to audit the election outcomes. There is
currently no known risk-limiting audit (RLA) method for STV, other than a full

bootstrap (equivalent to an improper prior). Our findings include that the

committing to a fixed information sharing protocol, the agents can
strategically decide at each time whether to share their private information
with each other or not. The agents incur a cost whenever they communicate with
each other and the adversary may eavesdrop on their communication. Thus, the
agents in the team must effectively coordinate with each other while being
robust to the adversary's malicious actions. We model this interaction between
the team and the adversary as a stochastic zero-sum game where the team aims to
minimize a cost while the adversary aims to maximize it. Under some assumptions
on the adversary's capabilities, we characterize a min-max control and

several structural results that can make the computation of the min-max

  G. Lodato, C.F. Manara",,,,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.GA astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most stars and thus most planetary systems do not form in isolation. The
larger star-forming environment affects protoplanetary disks in multiple ways:
gravitational interactions with other stars truncate disks and alter the
architectures of exoplanet systems; external irradiation from nearby high-mass
stars truncates disks and shortens their lifetimes; and remaining gas and dust
in the environment affects dynamical evolution (if removed by feedback
processes) and provides some shielding for disks from external irradiation. The
dynamical evolution of the region regulates when and how long various feedback
mechanisms impact protoplanetary disks. Density is a key parameter that
regulates the intensity and duration of UV irradiation and the frequency of
dynamical encounters. The evolution of larger star-forming complexes may also
play an important role by mixing populations. Observations suggest that
clusters are not a single-age population but multiple populations with small
age differences which may be key to resolving several timescale issues (i.e.,
proplyd lifetimes, enrichment). In this review, we consider stellar clusters as
the ecosystems in which most stars and therefore most planets form. We review
recent observational and theoretical results and highlight upcoming
contributions from facilities expected to begin observations in the next five
years. Looking further ahead, we argue that the next frontier is large-scale
surveys of low-mass stars in more distant high-mass star-forming regions. The
future of ecosystem studies is bright as faint low-mass stars in more distant
high-mass star-forming regions will be routinely observable in the era of
Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs).

observe eight eclipses of KELT-1b with CHEOPS (CHaracterising ExOPlanet
Satellite) to measure its dayside brightness temperature in the bluest passband
observed so far, and model the CHEOPS photometry jointly with the existing
optical and NIR photometry from TESS, LBT, CFHT, and Spitzer. Our modelling
leads to a self-consistent dayside spectrum for KELT-1b covering the CHEOPS,
TESS, H , Ks, and Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 ${\mu}$m bands, where our TESS, H ,
Ks, and Spitzer band estimates largely agree with the previous studies, but we
discover a strong discrepancy between the CHEOPS and TESS bands. The CHEOPS
observations yield a higher photometric precision than the TESS observations,
but do not show a significant eclipse signal, while a deep eclipse is detected
in the TESS band. The derived TESS geometric albedo of $0.36^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$
is difficult to reconcile with a CHEOPS geometric albedo that is consistent
with zero because the two passbands have considerable overlap. Variability in
cloud cover caused by the transport of transient nightside clouds to the
dayside could provide an explanation for reconciling the TESS and CHEOPS
geometric albedos, but this hypothesis needs to be tested by future
observations.

understanding the early evolution of Universe has always been difficult for
mankind. Our promising strategy is based on a novel class of symmetric
teleparallel theories of gravity called $f(Q)$, in which the gravitational
interaction is caused by the non-metricity scalar $Q$, which may help to solve
some problems. We consider the locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi
type-I spacetime cosmological models and derive the motion of equations to
study the early evolution of the cosmos. By assuming the Hybrid Expansion Law
(HEL) for the average scale factor, we are able to determine the solutions to
the field equations of Bianchi type-I spacetime. We discuss the energy density
profile, the equation of state, and the skewness parameter and conclude that
our models preserve anisotropic spatial geometry during the early stages of the
Universe with the possibility of an anisotropic fluid present. However, as time
goes on, even in the presence of an anisotropic fluid, the Universe may move
towards isotropy due to inflation while the anisotropy of the fluid dims away
at the same time. It is seen from the squared speed of sound that Universe
shows phantom nature at the beginning then approaches to dark energy at present
epoch. We analyze both geometrical and physical behaviors of the derived model.

are implemented in ANSYS Fluent 2019R2 via User Defined Function (UDF) code
written in C. The model is in good agreement with experiments provided by

are performed to obtain realistic heat transfer coefficients. They indicate
that the coupling of food transport equations to the surrounding heat transfer
mechanisms, such as radiation and natural convection, seems promising for
future research. Co-simulation of the process is not feasible during operation
in the field, so reduced-order models (ROM) are introduced. An evaluation of

analyze each geographical site independently, we propose a spatial-aware
approach that considers also the characteristics of close sites. Specifically,
we build upon Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to aggregate features from
neighbouring places, and further extend these modules to consider multiple
relations, such as the difference in temperature and soil moisture between two
sites, as well as the geographical distance. Moreover, we inject time-related
information directly into the model to take into account the seasonality of
virus spread.
  We design an experimental setting that combines satellite images - from
Landsat and Sentinel missions - with ground truth observations of WNV
circulation in Italy. We show that our proposed Multi-Adjacency Graph Attention
Network (MAGAT) consistently leads to higher performance when paired with an
appropriate pre-training stage. Finally, we assess the importance of each
component of MAGAT in our ablation studies.

  prediction of Lithium-Ion Batteries","13 pages,15 figures,13 equations",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, significant progress has been made in transportation
electrification. And lithium-ion batteries (LIB), as the main energy storage
devices, have received widespread attention. Accurately predicting the state of
health (SOH) can not only ease the anxiety of users about the battery life but
also provide important information for the management of the battery. This
paper presents a prediction method for SOH based on Vision Transformer (ViT)
model. First, discrete charging data of a predefined voltage range is used as
an input data matrix. Then, the cycle features of the battery are captured by
the ViT which can obtain the global features, and the SOH is obtained by
combining the cycle features with the full connection (FC) layer. At the same
time, transfer learning (TL) is introduced, and the prediction model based on
source task battery training is further fine-tuned according to the early cycle
data of the target task battery to provide an accurate prediction. Experiments
show that our method can obtain better feature expression compared with
existing deep learning methods so that better prediction effect and transfer
effect can be achieved.

an optimal mesh for an arbitrary blade passage is developed. Despite automation
in mesh generation using either an empirical approach or an optimization
algorithm, repeated tuning of meshing parameters is still required for a new
geometry. The method developed herein employs a DRL-based multi-condition
optimization technique to define optimal meshing parameters as a function of
the blade geometry, attaining automation, minimization of human intervention,
and computational efficiency. The meshing parameters are optimized by training
an elliptic mesh generator which generates a structured mesh for a blade
passage with an arbitrary blade geometry. During each episode of the DRL
process, the mesh generator is trained to produce an optimal mesh for a
randomly selected blade passage by updating the meshing parameters until the
mesh quality, as measured by the ratio of determinants of the Jacobian matrices
and the skewness, reaches the highest level. Once the training is completed,
the mesh generator create an optimal mesh for a new arbitrary blade passage in
a single try without an repetitive process for the parameter tuning for mesh
generation from the scratch. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
method are demonstrated through the generation of meshes for various blade
passages.

this approach resamples these blocks instead of original data. However, it is
typically nontrivial to uncover the dependent structure among utterances and

statistically consistent under mild conditions. We also demonstrate the

denoising of a time-series data with 100% added noise but suffered in regions

balancing bias and variance errors in selecting the number of unstructured

asymptotic statistical convergence with known test data and reduces synthetic
noise on experimental signals from Hall Effect Thrusters (HETs) with greater
success than the original grid-based strategy.

where a cooperative jammer (Jammer) tries to attract a multi-antenna adversary
(Willie) and degrade the adversary's reception ability for the signal from a
transmitter (Alice). For this strategy, we formulate an optimization problem to
maximize the covert rate when three different types of channel state
information (CSI) are available. The total power is optimally allocated between
Alice and Jammer subject to Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence constraint.
Different from the existing literature, in our proposed strategy, we also
determine the optimal transmission power at the jammer when Alice is silent,
while existing works always assume that the jammer's power is fixed.
Specifically, we apply the S-procedure to convert infinite constraints into
linear-matrix-inequalities (LMI) constraints. When statistical CSI at Willie is
available, we convert double integration to single integration using asymptotic
approximation and substitution method. In addition, the transmission strategy
without jammer deception is studied as a benchmark. Finally, our simulation
results show that for the proposed strategy, the covert rate is increased with
the number of antennas at Willie. Moreover, compared to the benchmark, our
proposed strategy is more robust in face of imperfect CSI.

The fact that we do not consists part of the Fermi paradox. The suggestion that
self-replicating probes will eventually mutate to consume their progenitors and
therefore significantly reduce the number of total probes has been investigated
and dismissed in the literature. In this work, we re-visit this question with a
more realistic Lotka-Volterra model, and show that mutated probes would drive
the progenitor probes into ""extinction"", thereby replacing them to spread
throughout the galaxy. Thus, the efficiency of mutated probes in reducing the
total number of self-replicating probes is even less than previously thought.
As part of the analysis, we also suggest that, somewhat counter-intuitively, in
designing self-replicating probes, one should not program them to stop
replicating when sufficient mutation causes the probes to fail to recognize the
progenitor probes as ""self"".

  Prediction in Waste Water",,,,,"q-bio.OT cs.LG stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  There exist opportunities for Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) in the
prediction of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) in waste water, using the diverse
water quality parameters as the input variables. The goal of this work is to
examine the capability of MLR in prediction of BOD in waste water through four
input variables: Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Nitrogen, Fecal Coliform and Total
Coliform. The four input variables have higher correlation strength to BOD out
of the seven parameters examined for the strength of correlation. Machine
Learning (ML) was done with both 80% and 90% of the data as the training set
and 20% and 10% as the test set respectively. MLR performance was evaluated
through the coefficient of correlation (r), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and
the percentage accuracy in prediction of BOD. The performance indices for the
input variables of Dissolved Oxygen, Nitrogen, Fecal Coliform and Total
Coliform in prediction of BOD are: RMSE=6.77mg/L, r=0.60 and accuracy 70.3% for
training dataset of 80% and RMSE=6.74mg/L, r=0.60 and accuracy of 87.5% for
training set of 90% of the dataset. It was found that increasing the percentage
of the training set above 80% of the dataset improved the accuracy of the model
only but did not have a significant impact on the prediction capacity of the
model. The results showed that MLR model could be successfully employed in the
estimation of BOD in waste water using appropriately selected input parameters.
