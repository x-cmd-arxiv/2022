ubiquitous presence of batch effects. Statistical methods for managing batch
effects were initially developed in the setting of sample group comparison and
later borrowed for other settings such as survival outcome prediction. The most
notable such method is ComBat, which adjusts for batches by including it as a
covariate alongside sample groups in a linear regression. In survival
prediction, however, ComBat is used without definable groups for survival
outcome and is done sequentially with survival regression for a potentially
confounded outcome. To address these issues, we propose a new method, called
BatMan (""BATch MitigAtion via stratificatioN""). It adjusts batches as strata in
survival regression and utilize variable selection methods such as LASSO to
handle high dimensionality. We assess the performance of BatMan in comparison
with ComBat, each used either alone or in conjunction with data normalization,
in a re-sampling-based simulation study under various levels of predictive
signal strength and patterns of batch-outcome association. Our simulations show
that (1) BatMan outperforms ComBat in nearly all scenarios when there are batch
effects in the data, and (2) their performance can be worsened by the addition
of data normalization. We further evaluate them using microRNA data for ovarian
cancer from the Cancer Genome Atlas, and find that BatMan outforms ComBat while
the addition of data normalization worsens the prediction. Our study thus shows
the advantage of BatMan and raises caution about the naive use of data
normalization in the context of developing survival prediction models. The

taking an existing method for promoting individual fairness on graphs and
extending it to support mini-batch, or sub-sample based, training of a GNN,
thus laying the groundwork for applying this method to a downstream
recommendation task. We evaluate two popular GNN methods: Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN), which trains on the entire graph, and GraphSAGE, which uses
probabilistic random walks to create subgraphs for mini-batch training, and
assess the effects of sub-sampling on individual fairness. We implement an
individual fairness notion called \textit{REDRESS}, proposed by Dong et al.,
which uses rank optimization to learn individual fair node, or item,
embeddings. We empirically show on two real world datasets that GraphSAGE is
able to achieve, not just, comparable accuracy, but also, improved fairness as
compared with the GCN model. These finding have consequential ramifications to
individual fairness promotion, GNNs, and in downstream form, recommender

allows aggregate information about a dataset to be released while controlling
privacy leakage for individuals whose records appear in the data. Due to the
unavoidable tension between privacy and utility, there have been many works
trying to relax the requirements of differential privacy to achieve greater
utility. One class of relaxation, which is starting to gain support outside the
privacy community is embodied by the definitions of individual differential
privacy (IDP) and bootstrap differential privacy (BDP). The original version of
differential privacy defines a set of neighboring database pairs and achieves
its privacy guarantees by requiring that each pair of neighbors should be
nearly indistinguishable to an attacker. The privacy definitions we study,
however, aggressively reduce the set of neighboring pairs that are protected.
Both IDP and BDP define a measure of ""privacy loss"" that satisfies formal
privacy properties such as postprocessing invariance and composition, and
achieve dramatically better utility than the traditional variants of
differential privacy. However, there is a significant downside - we show that
they allow a significant portion of the dataset to be reconstructed using
algorithms that have arbitrarily low privacy loss under their privacy
accounting rules. We demonstrate these attacks using the preferred mechanisms
of these privacy definitions. In particular, we design a set of queries that,
when protected by these mechanisms with high noise settings (i.e., with claims
of very low privacy loss), yield more precise information about the dataset
than if they were not protected at all.

interferometry (VLBI) to determine a statistical correction factor for the DR3
parallaxes using a sub-sample of 33 maser-emitting oxygen-rich nearby AGB

underestimated by a factor of 5.44 for the brightest sources ($G<8$ mag).
Fainter sources ($8\leq G<12$) require a lower parallax error inflation factor
of 2.74. We obtain a Gaia DR3 parallax zero-point offset of -0.077 mas for
bright AGB stars. The offset becomes more negative for fainter AGB stars. We
calculated the distances of about 200 AGB stars in the DEATHSTAR project using
a Bayesian statistical approach on the corrected DR3 parallaxes and a prior
based on the previously determined Galactic distribution of AGB stars. We found
that the derived Gaia distances are associated with significant, asymmetrical

transfer modelling of the stellar and dust emission to determine the luminosity
of the sources in the VLBI sub-sample based on the distances derived from maser

Galactic oxygen-rich Mira variables. A new distance catalogue based on these
results is provided for the sources in the DEATHSTAR sample. We found that a

Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations plays an important role in the emerging field of
data-driven RANS modeling. Small errors carried in high-fidelity data can
propagate amplified errors into the mean flow field, and higher Reynolds
numbers worsen the error propagation. In this study, we compare a series of
propagation methods for two cases of Prandtl's secondary flows of the second
kind: square-duct flow at a low Reynolds number and roughness-induced secondary
flow at a very high Reynolds number. We show that frozen treatments result in
less error propagation than the implicit treatment of Reynolds stress tensor
(RST), and for cases with very high Reynolds numbers, explicit and implicit
treatments are not recommended. Inspired by the obtained results, we introduce
the frozen treatment to the propagation of Reynolds force vector (RFV), which
leads to less error propagation. Specifically, for both cases at low and high
Reynolds numbers, propagation of RFV results in one order of magnitude lower
error compared to RST propagation. In the frozen treatment method, three
different eddy-viscosity models are used to evaluate the effect of turbulent
diffusion on error propagation. We show that, regardless of the baseline model,
the frozen treatment of RFV results in less error propagation. We combined one
extra correction term for turbulent kinetic energy with the frozen treatment of
RFV, which makes our propagation technique capable of reproducing both velocity

building internet-scale 3D search engines. The discussion centers on the most
pressing data management issues in this domain, including model acquisition,
support for multiple file formats, asset versioning, data integrity errors, the
data lifecycle, intellectual property, and the legality of web crawling. The
paper also discusses numerous issues that fall under the rubric of trustworthy
computing, including privacy, security, inappropriate content, and
copying/remixing of assets. The goal of the paper is to provide an overview of
these general issues, illustrated by empirical data drawn from the internet's
largest operational search engine. While numerous works have been published on
3D information retrieval, this paper is the first to discuss the real-world

target representation is unnecessary for learning good representations, since
different targets tend to derive similarly behaved models. Driven by this
observation, we propose a multi-stage masked distillation pipeline and use a
randomly initialized model as the teacher, enabling us to effectively train
high-capacity models without any efforts to carefully design target

capacity, obtaining distilled students with remarkable transferring ability. On
different tasks of classification, transfer learning, object detection, and
semantic segmentation, the proposed method to perform masked knowledge
distillation with bootstrapped teachers (dBOT) outperforms previous
self-supervised methods by nontrivial margins. We hope our findings, as well as

curves (LCs) have been observed, representing a broad morphological variety. In
this work, we investigate which of these can be modelled by assuming a
double-peaked distribution of their radioactive material, as originally
proposed for SN2005bf. The inner zone corresponds to the regular explosive
nucleosynthesis and extends outwards, according to the usual scenario of
mixing. The outer 56Ni-rich shell may be related to the effect of jet-like
outflows that have interacted with more distant portions of the star before the
arrival of the SN shock. As the outer layer is covered by matter that is
optically less thick, its energy emerges earlier and generates a first peak of
radiation. To investigate this scenario in more detail, we have applied our
hydrodynamic code that follows the shock propagation through the progenitor
star and takes into account the effect of the gamma-ray photons produced by the
decay of the radioactive isotopes. We present a simple parametric model for the
56Ni abundance profile and explore the consequences on the LC of individually
varying the quantities that define this distribution, setting our focus onto
the stripped-envelope progenitors. In this first study, we are interested in
the applicability of this model to SNe that have not been classified as
superluminous, thus, we have selected our parameter space accordingly. Then,
within the same mathematical prescription for the 56Ni-profile, we revisited
the modelling process for a series of objects: SN2005bf, PTF2011mnb, SN2019cad,
and SN2008D. In some cases, a decrease in the gamma ray opacity is required to
fit the late time observations. We also discuss the other cases in which this
scenario might be likely to explain the LC morphology.

  threat","6 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A wide variety of brain gyrification patterns can be seen across species.
This variety should be a reflection of another variety, which could be the wide
variety of species' lifestyles in terms of the threat of head impact. We argue
that the headbutting seen in goats can easily hurt their brains. Those goats
that can mitigate brain damage better than others tend to win the headbutting,
improving their chances of mating and passing on the associated traits. An
outstanding characteristic of the goat brain is the small gyral size, which
could be one trait that protects the brain against head impact. The same
relationship between the severity of the threat of head impact and gyral size
can be seen in other species. On the other hand, low threat of head impact can
be associated with lissencephaly, such as in manatees and dugongs. The trend
suggests that gyrification is about protecting the brain against contact
dynamic head impact that often occurs in nature. Although how gyrification may
protect the brain is not clear, it should be associated with the brain
topological features and mechanics of the brain. One possible mechanism is that
cerebrospinal fluid within sulci may mitigate acceleration and acoustic waves
generated by head impact. Meanwhile, lissencephaly in nature suggests that
lissencephaly may have some advantages over gyrencephaly. One advantage could
be that the lack of sulci would increase neural connectivity.

who tries to influence the behavior of a self-interested receiver. We consider
settings where the receiver faces a sequential decision making (SDM) problem.
At each round, the sender observes the realizations of random events in the SDM
problem. This begets the challenge of how to incrementally disclose such
information to the receiver to persuade them to follow (desirable) action
recommendations. We study the case in which the sender does not know random
events probabilities, and, thus, they have to gradually learn them while
persuading the receiver. We start by providing a non-trivial polytopal
approximation of the set of sender's persuasive information structures. This is
crucial to design efficient learning algorithms. Next, we prove a negative
result: no learning algorithm can be persuasive. Thus, we relax persuasiveness
requirements by focusing on algorithms that guarantee that the receiver's
regret in following recommendations grows sub-linearly. In the full-feedback
setting -- where the sender observes all random events realizations -- , we
provide an algorithm with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for both the sender and
the receiver. Instead, in the bandit-feedback setting -- where the sender only
observes the realizations of random events actually occurring in the SDM
problem -- , we design an algorithm that, given an $\alpha \in [1/2, 1]$ as
input, ensures $\tilde{O}({T^\alpha})$ and $\tilde{O}( T^{\max \{ \alpha,
1-\frac{\alpha}{2} \} })$ regrets, for the sender and the receiver

discrete spacetime transformations ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) in a
gravitational context, first in de Sitter and finally in quasi de Sitter. As a
result we obtain inflationary quantum fluctuations that are produced in pairs

too small to allow for DM generation via standard freeze-out. DM is therefore
thermally decoupled from the visible sector and must be generated through
either freeze-in or decoupled freeze-out (DFO). In the DFO regime, we present
an improved approach to obtain the relic density by solving a set of three
stiff coupled Boltzmann equations, one of which describes the energy transfer
from the SM to the dark sector. Having determined the region of parameter space
where the correct relic density is obtained, we revisit experimental
constraints from electron beam dump experiments, rare $B$ and $K$ decays,
exotic Higgs decays at the LHC, astrophysics, dark matter searches and
cosmology. In particular, for our specific ALP scenario we (re)calculate and
improve beam dump, flavour and supernova constraints. Throughout our
calculation we implement state-of-the-art chiral perturbation theory results
for the ALP partial decay width to hadrons. We find that while the DFO region,
which predicts extremely small ALP-fermion couplings, can probably only be
constrained by cosmological observables, the freeze-in region covers a wide
area of parameter space that may be accessible to other more direct probes.
Some of this parameter space is already excluded, but a significant part should

have realized an elementary quantum optics model, the squeezed Kerr oscillator.
This model displays, as the squeezing amplitude is increased, a cross-over from
a single ground state regime to a doubly-degenerate ground state regime. In the
latter case, the ground state manifold is spanned by Schr\""odinger-cat states,
i.e. quantum superpositions of coherent states with opposite phases. For the
first time, having resolved up to the tenth excited state in a spectroscopic
experiment, we confirm that the proposed emergent static effective Hamiltonian
correctly describes the system, despite its driven character. We also find that
the lifetime of the coherent state components of the cat states increases in
steps as a function of the squeezing amplitude. We interpret the staircase
pattern as resulting from pairwise level kissing in the excited state spectrum.
Considering the Kerr-cat qubit encoded in this ground state manifold, we
achieve for the first time quantum nondemolition readout fidelities greater
than 99%, and enhancement of the phase-flip lifetime by more than two orders of
magnitude, while retaining universal quantum control. Our experiment
illustrates the crucial role of parametric drive Hamiltonian engineering for
hardware-efficient quantum computation.

human annotations as a source of supervision.
  In this work, we first formalize a system where interactions with one model
are recorded as history and scraped as training data in the future. We then
analyze its stability over time by tracking changes to a test-time bias
statistic (e.g. gender bias of model predictions). We find that the degree of
bias amplification is closely linked to whether the model's outputs behave like
samples from the training distribution, a behavior which we characterize and
define as consistent calibration. Experiments in three conditional prediction
scenarios - image classification, visual role-labeling, and language generation
- demonstrate that models that exhibit a sampling-like behavior are more
calibrated and thus more stable. Based on this insight, we propose an
intervention to help calibrate and stabilize unstable feedback systems.

Explainable AI (xAI) to enable humans to gain insight into the decision-making

techniques has not yet been characterized in human-machine teaming.
Importantly, xAI offers the promise of enhancing team situational awareness
(SA) and shared mental model development, which are the key characteristics of
effective human-machine teams. Rapidly developing such mental models is
especially critical in ad hoc human-machine teaming, where agents do not have a
priori knowledge of others' decision-making strategies. In this paper, we
present two novel human-subject experiments quantifying the benefits of
deploying xAI techniques within a human-machine teaming scenario. First, we
show that xAI techniques can support SA ($p<0.05)$. Second, we examine how
different SA levels induced via a collaborative AI policy abstraction affect ad
hoc human-machine teaming performance. Importantly, we find that the benefits
of xAI are not universal, as there is a strong dependence on the composition of
the human-machine team. Novices benefit from xAI providing increased SA
($p<0.05$) but are susceptible to cognitive overhead ($p<0.05$). On the other
hand, expert performance degrades with the addition of xAI-based support
($p<0.05$), indicating that the cost of paying attention to the xAI outweighs
the benefits obtained from being provided additional information to enhance SA.
Our results demonstrate that researchers must deliberately design and deploy
the right xAI techniques in the right scenario by carefully considering
human-machine team composition and how the xAI method augments SA.

maximal overlap discrete wavelet transformation (MODWT) to the time series data

nonstationarity and long-range nonlinear dependencies in the time series.
Evaluating our framework on several publicly available benchmark time series

systems. Self-consistent descriptions of quantum mechanics based on
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians have been developed and continue to be refined. In

characterized the intergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionization. Our
analysis uses the formalism of persistent homology, which offers a highly
intuitive and comprehensive description of the ionization topology in terms of
the births and deaths of topological features. Features are identified as
$k$-dimensional holes in the ionization bubble network, whose abundance is
given by the $k$th Betti number: $\beta_0$ for ionized bubbles, $\beta_1$ for
tunnels, and $\beta_2$ for neutral islands. Using semi-numerical models of
reionization, we investigate the dependence on the properties of sources and
sinks of ionizing radiation. Of all topological features, we find that the
tunnels dominate during reionization and that their number is easiest to
observe and most sensitive to the astrophysical parameters of interest, such as
the gas fraction and halo mass necessary for star formation. Seen as a phase
transition, the importance of the tunnels can be explained by the entanglement
of two percolating clusters and the fact that higher-dimensional features arise
when lower-dimensional features link together. We also study the relation
between the morphological components of the bubble network (bubbles, tunnels,
islands) and those of the cosmic web (clusters, filaments, voids), describing a
correspondence between the $k$-dimensional features of both. Finally, we apply
the formalism to mock observations of the 21-cm signal. Assuming 1000
observation hours with HERA Phase II, we show that astrophysical models can be
differentiated and confirm that persistent homology provides additional

signifying their skill level. A rating system is a procedure by which player
ratings are adjusted upwards each time they win, or downwards each time they
lose.
  Many matchmaking systems give players some control over their opponent's
rating; for example, a player might be able to selectively initiate matches
against opponents whose ratings are publicly visible, or abort a match without
penalty before it begins but after glimpsing their opponent's rating. It is
natural to ask whether one can design a rating system that does not incentivize
a rating-maximizing player to act strategically, seeking matches against
opponents of one rating over another. We show the following:
  - The full version of this ""opponent indifference"" property is unfortunately
too strong to be feasible. Although it is satisfied by some rating systems,
these systems lack certain desirable expressiveness properties, suggesting that
they are not suitable to capture most games of interest.
  - However, there is a natural relaxation, roughly requiring indifference
between any two opponents who are ``reasonably evenly matched'' with the
choosing player. We prove that this relaxed variant of opponent indifference,
which we call $P$ opponent indifference, is viable. In fact, a certain strong
version of $P$ opponent indifference precisely characterizes the rating system

forcing. Recent and upcoming observing missions of exoplanets and stars in the
Galaxy help to provide constraints on the physics of tidal dissipation. It is
timely to develop new N-body codes, which allow for experimentation with
various tidal models and numerical implementations. We present the open-source
N-body code TIDYMESS, which stands for ``TIdal DYnamics of Multi-body
ExtraSolar Systems''. This code implements a creep deformation law for the
bodies, parametrized by their fluid Love numbers and fluid relaxation times.
Due to tidal and centrifugal deformations, we approximate the general shape of
a body to be an ellipsoid. We calculate the associated gravitational field to
quadruple order, from which we derive the gravitational accelerations and
torques. The equations of motion for the orbits, spins and deformations are
integrated directly using a fourth-order integration method based on a
symplectic composition. We implement a novel integration method for the
deformations, which allows for a time step solely dependent on the orbits, and
not on the spin periods or fluid relaxation times. This feature greatly speeds
up the calculations, while also improving the consistency when comparing
different tidal regimes. We demonstrate the capabilities and performance of
TIDYMESS, particularly in the niche regime of parameter space where orbits are
chaotic and tides become non-linear.

robust oxygen abundance gradient of $-$0.037 $\pm$ 0.007 dex/kpc and indicate a
relatively small (0.043 $\pm$ 0.015 dex) intrinsic dispersion in oxygen

essential in weak lensing studies. The self-calibration method combines angular
auto- and cross-correlations between galaxies in multiple photometric redshift

bins. In this paper, we test a recently proposed self-calibration algorithm
using the DECaLS Data Release 9 and investigate to what extent the scattering
rates are determined. We first mitigate the spurious angular correlations due
to imaging systematics by a machine learning based method. We then improve the
algorithm for $\chi^2$ minimization and error estimation. Finally, we solve for
the scattering matrices, carry out a series of consistency tests and find
reasonable agreements: (1) finer photo-$z$ bins return a high-resolution
scattering matrix, and it is broadly consistent with the low-resolution matrix
from wider bins; (2) the scattering matrix from the Northern Galactic Cap is
almost identical to that from Southern Galactic Cap; (3) the scattering
matrices are in reasonable agreement with those constructed from the power

of cosmic magnification. Although it changes little the diagonal elements of
the scattering matrix, it affects the off-diagonals significantly. The
scattering matrix also shows some dependence on scale cut of input

certain scattering pairs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of the

the resulting SM contributions to rare decay branching ratios cannot be

suitable ratios of the $K$ and $B$ rare decay branching ratios to $\Delta M_s$,
$\Delta M_d$ and $|\varepsilon_K|$, all calculated within the SM. These three

well measured so that rather precise true SM predictions for the ratios in

$\Delta M_s$, $\Delta M_d$, $|\varepsilon_K|$, and the mixing induced

a template for the late-time kSZ effect using external surveys of large-scale

order to remove some portion of the kSZ signal. After building intuition for
general aspects of the de-kSZing procedure, we perform forecasts for the

DESI, Roman, MegaMapper, and PUMA. We also highlight potential applications of
de-kSZing to cosmological constraints from the CMB temperature power spectrum,
CMB lensing reconstruction, and the moving-lens effect. While our forecasts
predict achievable de-kSZing efficiencies of 10-20% at best, these results are
specific to the de-kSZing formalism adopted in this work, and we expect that

several features in common with the CSDR for quantum field theories. It enables
a study of the expansion of the correlation function around $u=v=1/4$, which is

remarkable features of the dispersive representation using the four point
correlation function of $\Phi_{1,2}$ operators in 2d minimal models as a

non-unitary Yang-Lee model. The CSDR and LTD further explain positivity of the
Taylor expansion coefficients of the correlation function around the crossing

precise characterisation of when it is consistent to treat a quantum subsystem
classically in such a limit, namely: in any quantum state corresponding to a
definite classical state in the classical limit, the reduced density matrix of
the subsystem must be approximately proportional to a projection operator, and
the projection operators for different classical subsystem states must obey an
approximate mutual orthogonality condition. These are strong constraints on the
entanglement structure of classical states. They generically give rise to
fundamentally non-local classical degrees of freedom, which may nevertheless be
accounted for using a completely local kinematical description, if one gauges
this description in the right way. The mechanism we describe is very general,
but for concreteness we exhibit a toy example involving three entangled spins
at high angular momentum, and we also describe a significant group-theoretic
generalisation of this toy example. Finally, we give evidence that this
phenomenon plays a role in the emergence of bulk diffeomorphism invariance in
gravity.

accurately estimated by equating the SMBH tidal field (including numerical
factors) to the maximum gravitational field in the star. We demonstrate that
this definition accurately reproduces the critical $\beta_{\rm c} = r_{\rm

R_{\star}\left(M_{\bullet}/M_{\star}\right)^{1/3}$ is the standard tidal radius
with $R_{\star}$ and $M_{\star}$ the stellar radius and mass and $M_{\bullet}$
the SMBH mass, for multiple stellar progenitors at various ages, and can be
reasonably approximated by $\beta_{\rm c} \simeq \left[\rho_{\rm
c}/(4\rho_{\star})\right]^{1/3}$, where $\rho_{\rm c}$ ($\rho_{\star}$) is the
central (average) stellar density. We also calculate the peak fallback rate and
time at which the fallback rate peaks, finding excellent agreement with
hydrodynamical simulations, and also suggest that the partial disruption radius
-- the distance at which any mass is successfully liberated from the star -- is
$\beta_{\rm partial} \simeq 4^{-1/3} \simeq 0.6$. For given stellar and SMBH

However, the evolution of the properties of interactions and of the galaxies

could vary across cosmic time. Using the VINTERGATAN cosmological zoom-in
simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy, we show here that starbursts, i.e.
episodes of fast star formation, are connected with the onset of tidal
compression, itself induced by mergers. However, this compression becomes
strong enough to trigger starbursts only after the formation of the galactic
disc. As a consequence, starburst episodes are only found during a precise
phase of galaxy evolution, after the formation of the disc and until the last
major merger. As the depletion time quantifies the instantaneous star formation
activity, while the specific star formation rate involves the integrated result
of the past activity (via the stellar mass), starburst episodes do not
necessarily coincide with elevated specific star formation rate. This suggests
that not all starburst galaxies are outliers above the main sequence of galaxy

molecular dynamics simulations of molecules and materials with ab initio

challenges remain to be addressed to enable predictive MLFF simulations of
realistic molecules, including: (1) developing efficient descriptors for
non-local interatomic interactions, which are essential to capture long-range
molecular fluctuations, and (2) reducing the dimensionality of the descriptors
in kernel methods (or a number of parameters in neural networks) to enhance the
applicability and interpretability of MLFFs. Here we propose an automatized
approach to substantially reduce the number of interatomic descriptor features
while preserving the accuracy and increasing the efficiency of MLFFs. To
simultaneously address the two stated challenges, we illustrate our approach on
the example of the global GDML MLFF; however, our methodology can be equally
applied to other models. We found that non-local features (atoms separated by
as far as 15$~\r{A}$ in studied systems) are crucial to retain the overall
accuracy of the MLFF for peptides, DNA base pairs, fatty acids, and
supramolecular complexes. Interestingly, the number of required non-local
features in the reduced descriptors becomes comparable to the number of local
interatomic features (those below 5$~\r{A}$). These results pave the way to
constructing global molecular MLFFs whose cost increases linearly, instead of
quadratically, with system size.

  Accounting for day-of-week demand patterns",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we deal with a storage assignment problem arising in a
fulfilment centre of a major European e-grocery retailer. The centre can be
characterised as a hybrid warehouse consisting of a highly efficient and
partially automated fast-picking area designed as a pick-and-pass system with
multiple stations, and a picker-to-parts area. The storage assignment problem
considered in this paper comprises the decisions to select the products to be
allocated to the fast-picking area, the assignment of the products to picking
stations and the determination of a shelf within the assigned station. The
objective is to achieve a high level of picking efficiency while respecting
station workload balancing and precedence order constraints. We propose to
solve this three-level problem using an integrated MILP model. In computational
experiments with real-world data, we show that using the proposed integrated
approach yields significantly better results than a sequential approach in
which the selection of products to be included in the fast-picking area is
solved before assigning station and shelf. Furthermore, we provide an extension
to the integrated storage assignment model that explicitly accounts for
within-week demand variation. In a set of experiments with
day-of-week-dependent demands we show that while a storage assignment that is
based on average demand figures tends to exhibit a highly imbalanced workload
on certain days of the week, the augmented model yields storage assignments
that are well balanced on each day of the week without compromising the quality
of the solutions in terms of picking efficiency.

time-evolving stochastic block models (SBM), in which the network evolution is
Markovian or non-Markovian. Under the majority rule, in each round, each agent
simultaneously updates his/her opinion according to the majority of his/her
neighbors. Our network has a community structure and randomly evolves with
time. In contrast to the classic setting, the dynamics is not purely
deterministic, and reflects the structure of SBM by resampling the connections
at each step, making agents with the same opinion more likely to connect than
those with different opinions.
  In the \emph{Markovian model}, connections between agents are resampled at
each step according to the SBM law and each agent updates his/her opinion via
the majority rule. We prove a \emph{power-of-one} type result, i.e., any
initial bias leads to a non-trivial advantage of winning in the end, uniformly
in the size of the network.
  In the \emph{non-Markovian model}, a connection between two agents is
resampled according to the SBM law only when some of the two changes opinion
and is otherwise kept the same. We study the phase transition between the fast
convergence to the consensus and a halt of the dynamics. Moreover, we establish
thresholds of the initial lead for various convergence speeds.

stocks"" have gained increasing attention from both retail and institutional
investors. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic model on optimal
liquidation in the presence of an asset bubble. Our setup allows the influx of
players to fuel the price of the asset. Moreover, traders will enter the market
at possibly different times and take advantage of the uptrend at the risk of an
inevitable crash. In particular, we consider two types of crashes: an
endogenous burst which results from excessive selling, and an exogenous burst
which cannot be anticipated and is independent from the actions of the traders.
  The popularity of asset bubbles suggests a large-population setting, which
naturally leads to a mean field game (MFG) formulation. We introduce a class of
MFGs with varying entry times. In particular, an equilibrium will depend on the
entry-weighted average of conditional optimal strategies. To incorporate the
exogenous burst time, we adopt the method of progressive enlargement of
filtrations. We prove existence of MFG equilibria using the weak formulation in
a generalized setup, and we show that the equilibrium strategy can be
decomposed into before-and-after-burst segments, each part containing only the
market information. We also perform numerical simulations of the solution,
which allow us to provide some intriguing results on the relationship between
the bubble burst and equilibrium strategies.

classified into four main categories -- ""AGN"" (AGN), ""AGN/SBnuc"" (AGN-starburst

higher 33 GHz luminosities and surface densities compared with ""SBnuc"" and

reflect higher non-thermal contribution from supernovae and/or ISM densities in

achieves robust and fast convergence via a two-stage optimization, i.e.,
SignSGD followed by mixed-precision SGD. Detailed theoretical analysis is
provided to prove the convergence of the proposed mixed-precision algorithm.
Numerical experiments on both synthetic and realistic tensor data sets show the

chiral A-like phase is also stabilized when $^3$He is confined to a slab of
thickness $D\sim \xi$, the superfluid coherence length. For both types of
confinement, scattering of quasiparticles by the random potential - aerogel or

generate skew scattering of quasiparticles in the plane normal to the chiral

nonequilibrium quasiparticles driven by a thermal gradient. We report
theoretical results for the anomalous thermal Hall conductivity for theoretical

remarkable properties compared to conventional materials due to their

environment is challenging due to the large scale of the problem. To
investigate this fundamental problem, we employ a combination of atomistic
simulations (using ab-initio and molecular dynamics) and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) to evaluate point defect and migration energies in an equimolar
CoFeCrNi MPEA. We show how energies of point defects can be predicted with
reasonable accuracy using a small subset of local chemical environments. Using
the CNNs, we develop a lattice Monte Carlo simulation that computes the
migration path and diffusivities of vacancies. Remarkably, our work illustrates
how the local chemical environment leads rise to a distribution function of the
point defect energies, which is responsible for the macroscopic diffusivity of
vacancies. In particular, we observed that vacancies get trapped in super
basins surrounded by large migration and connected with low migration energy
states. As a result, vacancy diffusivity is highly dependent on the environment
and could change several orders of magnitude for a given temperature. Our works
illustrate the importance of understanding properties in MPEAs depending on the
local chemical environment and the ability of CNN to provide a model for
computing energies in high-dimensional spaces, which can be used to scale
things up to higher-order models.

explored by the RecSys community. Unfortunately, this has led to a
proliferation of possible fairness metrics from which practitioners can choose.
The increase in volume and complexity of metrics creates a need for
practitioners to deeply understand the nuances of fairness definitions and
implementations. Additionally, practitioners need to understand the ethical
guidelines that accompany these metrics for responsible implementation. Recent
work has shown that there is a proliferation of ethics guidelines and has
pointed to the need for more implementation guidance rather than principles

We introduce $n$-Shapley Values, a parametric family of local post-hoc

terms up to order $n$. By varying the parameter $n$, we obtain a sequence of
explanations that covers the entire range from Shapley Values up to a uniquely

their limitations. We then show that $n$-Shapley Values, as well as the Shapley
Taylor- and Faith-Shap interaction indices, recover GAMs with interaction terms
up to order $n$. This implies that the original Shapely Values recover GAMs

condensates is formulated by extending the random phase approximation (RPA) and
field-theoretic simulation (FTS) of heteropolymers with spatially long-range
Coulomb interactions to include the fundamental effects of short-range,
hydrophobic-like interactions between amino acid residues. To this end,
short-range effects are modeled by Yukawa interactions between multiple
nonelectrostatic charges derived from an eigenvalue decomposition of pairwise
residue-residue contact energies. Chain excluded volume is afforded by
incompressibility constraints. A mean-field approximation leads to an effective
Flory $\chi$ parameter, which, in conjunction with RPA, accounts for the
contact-interaction effects of amino acid composition and the sequence-pattern
effects of long-range electrostatics in IDP LLPS, whereas FTS based on the
formulation provides full sequence dependence for both short- and long-range
interactions. This general approach is illustrated here by applications to
variants of a natural IDP in the context of several different amino-acid
interaction schemes as well as a set of different model hydrophobic-polar
sequences sharing the same composition. Effectiveness of the methodology is
verified by coarse-grained explicit-chain molecular dynamics simulations.

combustion method using halloysite nanocrystals as seeds and analyzed the
dosimetric characteristics of these samples, including radioluminescence (RL),
thermoluminescence (TL), and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). Both SEM
images and XRD pointed to the halloysite nanotubes acting as heterogeneous
nucleation seeds. RL spectra indicate the presence of Cr$^{3+}$ ions due to
impurities from the precursors. However, besides acting as nucleation seeds,
the halloysite nanotubes were still able to adsorb the Cr$^{3+}$ ions, as
evidenced by the decreased RL emission attributed to the Cr$^{3+}$ luminescent
centers. Decreased TL intensity upon increasing HNT content together with the
RL data suggested that the Cr$^{3+}$ ions have strong participation in the TL
emission process as a luminescent center. Surprisingly, the samples with HNT
showed up to 6-fold enhanced OSL area intensity and 69-fold OSL initial
intensity enhancement, revealing that, by scavenging Cr$^{3+}$, the HNT
eliminated a luminescent center that competes with the OSL emission. Therefore,
HNTs are promising nanomaterial to enhance the sensitivity of
$\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ dosimeters with potential application in medical physics,
revealing that the presence of HNT in Al$_2$O$_3$ decreased the density of
competing for luminescent centers and increased OSL intensity.

different domains, and one of the most exciting applications is autonomous
vehicles (AVs), which have encouraged the development of a number of ML
algorithms from perception to prediction to planning. However, training AVs
usually requires a large amount of training data collected from different
driving environments (e.g., cities) as well as different types of personal
information (e.g., working hours and routes). Such collected large data,
treated as the new oil for ML in the data-centric AI era, usually contains a
large amount of privacy-sensitive information which is hard to remove or even
audit. Although existing privacy protection approaches have achieved certain
theoretical and empirical success, there is still a gap when applying them to
real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles. For instance, when
training AVs, not only can individually identifiable information reveal
privacy-sensitive information, but also population-level information such as
road construction within a city, and proprietary-level commercial secrets of
AVs. Thus, it is critical to revisit the frontier of privacy risks and
corresponding protection approaches in AVs to bridge this gap. Following this
goal, in this work, we provide a new taxonomy for privacy risks and protection
methods in AVs, and we categorize privacy in AVs into three levels: individual,
population, and proprietary. We explicitly list out recent challenges to
protect each of these levels of privacy, summarize existing solutions to these
challenges, discuss the lessons and conclusions, and provide potential future

degrades pathologically when processing subsequent messages. We identify key
challenges in applying canonical program analysis techniques: large input space
of messages (e.g., stateful OpenFlow protocol), complex code base and software
architecture (e.g., OSGi framework with dynamic launch), and the semantic
dependencies between the internal state and external inputs. We design SPIDER,
a practical fuzzing workflow that tackles these challenges and automatically
uncovers such issues in SDN controllers. SPIDER's design entails a careful

global model leveraging data from distributed users. As the local training data
come from different users who may not be trustworthy, several studies have
shown that FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Meanwhile, to protect the
privacy of local users, FL is always trained in a differentially private way
(DPFL). Thus, in this paper, we ask: Can we leverage the innate privacy
property of DPFL to provide certified robustness against poisoning attacks? Can
we further improve the privacy of FL to improve such certification? We first
investigate both user-level and instance-level privacy of FL and propose novel
mechanisms to achieve improved instance-level privacy. We then provide two
robustness certification criteria: certified prediction and certified attack
cost for DPFL on both levels. Theoretically, we prove the certified robustness
of DPFL under a bounded number of adversarial users or instances. Empirically,
we conduct extensive experiments to verify our theories under a range of
attacks on different datasets. We show that DPFL with a tighter privacy
guarantee always provides stronger robustness certification in terms of
certified attack cost, but the optimal certified prediction is achieved under a
proper balance between privacy protection and utility loss.

a surge is expected. To ensure what is being communicated is useful we need to
be able to evaluate how well the predicted shape matches with the ground truth
shape. Instead of treating this as a classification problem (one out of $n$
shapes), we define a transformation of the numerical forecasts into a
``shapelet''-space representation. In this representation, each dimension
corresponds to the similarity of the shape with one of the shapes of interest
(a shapelet). We prove that this representation satisfies the property that two
shapes that one would consider similar are mapped close to each other, and vice

trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths time-series. With this representation, we
define an evaluation measure and a measure of agreement among multiple models.
We also define the shapelet-space ensemble of multiple models as the mean of

with a mixture of different cell types. A critical first step in such analyses
is the accurate estimation of cell-type proportions in a bulk sample. Although
many methods have been proposed recently, quantifying the uncertainties
associated with the estimated cell-type proportions has not been well studied.
Lack of consideration of these uncertainties can lead to missed or false
findings in downstream analyses. In this article, we introduce a flexible
statistical deconvolution framework that allows a general and subject-specific
covariance of bulk gene expressions. Under this framework, we propose a
decorrelated constrained least squares method called DECALS that estimates
cell-type proportions as well as the sampling distribution of the estimates.
Simulation studies demonstrate that DECALS can accurately quantify the
uncertainties in the estimated proportions whereas other methods fail. Applying
DECALS to analyze bulk gene expression data of post mortem brain samples from
the ROSMAP and GTEx projects, we show that taking into account the
uncertainties in the estimated cell-type proportions can lead to more accurate
identifications of cell-type-specific differentially expressed genes and

has been continuously growing, the development of strategies for analyzing
resulting chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is lagging behind. A CRN consists
of compounds linked by reactions. Analyzing how these compounds are transformed
into one another based on kinetic modeling is a nontrivial task. Here, we
present the graph-optimization-driven algorithm and program Pathfinder to allow
for such an analysis of a CRN. The CRN for this work has been obtained with our
open-source Chemoton reaction network exploration software. Chemoton probes
reactive combinations of compounds for elementary steps and sorts them into
reactions. By encoding these reactions of the CRN as a graph consisting of
compound and reaction vertices and adding information about activation barriers
as well as required reagents to the edges of the graph yields a complete
graph-theoretical representation of the CRN. Since the probabilities of the
formation of compounds depend on the starting conditions, the consumption of
any compound during a reaction must be accounted for to reflect the
availability of reagents. To account for this, we introduce compound costs to
reflect compound availability. Simultaneously, the determined compound costs
rank the compounds in the CRN in terms of their probability to be formed. This
ranking then allows us to probe easily accessible compounds in the CRN first
for further explorations into yet unexplored terrain. We first illustrate the
working principle on an abstract small CRN. Afterward, Pathfinder is
demonstrated in the example of the disproportionation of iodine with water and
the comproportionation of iodic acid and hydrogen iodide. Both processes are
analyzed within the same CRN which we construct with our autonomous
first-principles CRN exploration software Chemoton guided by Pathfinder.

derived from the close-in ($2<P_{\mathrm{orb}}<100$ days) population, whose
radii may have evolved differently under the effect of atmospheric mass loss
mechanisms. In this work, we compute the intrinsic occurrence rates of close-in
super-Earths ($\sim1-2\,R_\oplus$) and sub-Neptunes ($\sim2-3.5\,R_\oplus$) for
FGK stars ($0.56-1.63\,M_\odot$) as a function of orbital period and find
evidence of two regimes: where super-Earths are more abundant at short orbital
periods, and where sub-Neptunes are more abundant at longer orbital periods. We
fit a parametric model in five equally populated stellar mass bins and find
that the orbital period of transition between these two regimes scales with
stellar mass, like $P_\mathrm{trans} \propto M_*^{1.7\pm0.2}$. These results
suggest a population of former sub-Neptunes contaminating the population of
Gyr-old close-in super-Earths, indicative of a population shaped by atmospheric
loss. Using our model to constrain the long-period population of intrinsically
rocky planets, we estimate an occurrence rate of $\Gamma_\oplus =
15^{+6}_{-4}\%$ for Earth-sized habitable zone planets, and predict that
sub-Neptunes may be $\sim$twice as common as super-Earths in the habitable zone
(when normalized over the natural log orbital period and radius range used).

traffic accidents. Advances in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computer Science have
enabled the detection of drivers' drowsiness by using Brain-Computer Interfaces
(BCIs) and Machine Learning (ML). Nevertheless, several challenges remain open
and should be faced. First, a comprehensive enough evaluation of drowsiness
detection performance using a heterogeneous set of ML algorithms is missing in
the literature. Last, it is needed to study the detection performance of
scalable ML models suitable for groups of subjects and compare it with the
individual models proposed in the literature. To improve these limitations,
this work presents an intelligent framework that employs BCIs and features
based on electroencephalography (EEG) for detecting drowsiness in driving
scenarios. The SEED-VIG dataset is used to feed different ML regressors and
three-class classifiers and then evaluate, analyze, and compare the
best-performing models for individual subjects and groups of them. More in
detail, regarding individual models, Random Forest (RF) obtained a 78%
f1-score, improving the 58% obtained by models used in the literature such as
Support Vector Machine (SVM). Concerning scalable models, RF reached a 79%
f1-score, demonstrating the effectiveness of these approaches. The lessons
learned can be summarized as follows: i) not only SVM but also other models not
sufficiently explored in the literature are relevant for drowsiness detection,
and ii) scalable approaches suitable for groups of subjects are effective to
detect drowsiness, even when new subjects that are not included in the models
training are evaluated.

are brought in contact with each other, they form a bubble-droplet aggregate.
Its equilibrium morphology and stability largely depend on the combination of
different components' surface tensions, known as spreading factor. In this
study, we look at the interaction between a rising bubble and a stationary
droplet to better understand the dynamics of coalescence and rising as well as
morphological changes for the bubble-droplet aggregate. A systematic study is
conducted on the interaction processes with various bubble sizes and spreading
factors. The current simulation framework consists of the ternary conservative
phase-field Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for interface tracking and the
velocity-pressure LBM for hydrodynamics, which is validated for the benchmark
cases such as liquid lens and parasitic currents around a static droplet with
several popular surface tension formulations. We further test our LBM for the
morphology changes of two droplets initially in contact with various spreading
factors and depict the final morphologies in a phase diagram. The separated,
partially engulfed and completely engulfed morphologies can be replicated by
systematically altering the sign of the spreading factors. The rising bubble
and stationary droplet interaction is simulated based on the final morphologies
obtained under stationary conditions by imposing an imaginary buoyancy force on
the rising bubble. The results indicate that the bubble-droplet aggregate with
double emulsion morphology can minimize the distotion of the bubble-droplet
aggregate and achieve a greater terminal velocity than the aggregate with
partially engulfed morphology.

during the inbound and outbound phases of the comet orbit. We consider the
images in EUV in the 171 {\AA} bandpass, where emission from oxygen ions
O$^{4+}$ and O$^{5+}$ is found. The striae are described as due to a beam of
ions injected along the local magnetic field, with the initial beam velocity
decaying because of collisions. Also, ion collisional diffusion contributes to
ion propagation. Both the collision time for velocity decay and the diffusion
coefficient for spatial spreading depend on the ambient plasma density. A
probabilistic description of the ion beam density along the magnetic field is
developed, where the beam position is given by the velocity decay and the
spreading of diffusing ions is described by a Gaussian probability
distribution. Profiles of emission intensity along the magnetic field are
computed and compared with the profiles along the striae observed by AIA,
showing a good agreement for most considered striae. The inferred coronal
densities are then compared with a hydrostatic model of the solar corona. The
results confirm that the coronal density is strongly spatially structured.

been proposed in which gravitational field equations are described by the
Cotton tensor. That theory allows an additional contribution to the
gravitational potential of a point mass that rises linearly with radius as
$\Phi = -GM/r + \gamma r/2$, where $G$ is the Newton constant. The coefficients
$M$ and $\gamma$ are the constants of integration and should be determined
individually for each physical system. When applied to galaxies, the
coefficient $\gamma$, which has the dimension of acceleration, should be
determined for each galaxy. This is the same as having to determine the mass
$M$ for each galaxy. If $\gamma$ is small enough, the linear potential term is
negligible at short distances, but can become significant at large distances.
In fact, it may contribute to the extragalactic systems. In this paper, we
derive the effective field equation for Cotton gravity applicable to
extragalactic systems. We then use the effective field equation to numerically
compute the gravitational potential of a sample of 84 rotating galaxies. The 84
galaxies span a wide range, from stellar disk-dominated spirals to
gas-dominated dwarf galaxies. We do not assume the radial density profile of
the stellar disk, bulge, or gas; we use only the observed data. We find that
the rotation curves of 84 galaxies can be explained by the observed
distribution of baryons. This is due to the flexibility of Cotton gravity to
allow the integration constant $\gamma$ for each galaxy. In the context of
Cotton gravity, ""dark matter"" is in some sense automatically included as a
curvature of spacetime. Consequently, even galaxies that have been assumed to
be dominated by dark matter do not need dark matter.

energy consumption for the delivery of time-sensitive and small products.
However, there is still a need in the relevant industry to understand the
performance of drone-based delivery under different business needs and drone
operating conditions. We studied a drone deployment optimization problem for
direct delivery of goods to customers maintaining a specified time window. This
paper presents a new mathematical optimization-based decision-making
methodology to help business owners optimally route their drone fleet
minimizing the total energy consumption, required fleet size, and the required
number of additional batteries. A realistic feature of the optimization method
is that instead of replacing the drone battery after each return to the depot,
it keeps track of the remaining energy in the drone battery and decides on
battery replacements accounting for the drone routing and the user-specified
minimum required battery energy. Numerical results based on real drone flight
tests and delivery data provide insights into the effect of different drone
operating parameters on the energy consumption, required fleet size, and the
required number of battery replacements. Results from a case study show that
the total energy consumption, required fleet size, and the required number of
battery replacements increase by 72.22%, 22.2%, and 200%, respectively, as the
drones fly over the road networks compared to flying in a straight path.
Additionally, results show that using a mixed fleet of hexacopter and
quadcopter drones reduces the total energy consumption by 48.52% compared to
using a homogeneous fleet of only hexacopters.

design, \citet{NR99} studied the problem of designing strategyproof mechanisms
for scheduling jobs on unrelated machines aiming to minimize the makespan. They
provided a strategyproof mechanism that achieves an $n$-approximation and they
made the bold conjecture that this is the best approximation achievable by any
deterministic strategyproof scheduling mechanism. After more than two decades
and several efforts, $n$ remains the best known approximation and very recent
work by \citet{CKK21} has been able to prove an $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$
approximation lower bound for all deterministic strategyproof mechanisms. This
strong negative result, however, heavily depends on the fact that the
performance of these mechanisms is evaluated using worst-case analysis. To
overcome such overly pessimistic, and often uninformative, worst-case bounds, a
surge of recent work has focused on the ``learning-augmented framework'', whose
goal is to leverage machine-learned predictions to obtain improved
approximations when these predictions are accurate (consistency), while also
achieving near-optimal worst-case approximations even when the predictions are
arbitrarily wrong (robustness).
  In this work, we study the classic strategic scheduling problem
of~\citet{NR99} using the learning-augmented framework and give a deterministic
polynomial-time strategyproof mechanism that is $6$-consistent and $2n$-robust.
We thus achieve the ``best of both worlds'': an $O(1)$ consistency and an
$O(n)$ robustness that asymptotically matches the best-known approximation. We
then extend this result to provide more general worst-case approximation
guarantees as a function of the prediction error. Finally, we complement our
positive results by showing that any $1$-consistent deterministic strategyproof
mechanism has unbounded robustness.

the phase contributions caused by 1) known environmental effects in both
gaseous and stellar matter backgrounds, or 2) high-order post-Newtonian {(PN)}
terms in the evolution of mHz GW sources {during the inspiral stage of massive
binaries}. We use the accuracy of currently available analytical waveform
models as a benchmark {value, finding} the following trends: the largest
unmodelled phase contributions are likely environmental rather than PN for
binaries lighter than $\sim 10^7/(1+z)^2$~M$_{\odot}$, where $z$ is the
redshift. Binaries heavier than $\sim 10^8/(1+z)$~M$_{\odot}$ do not require
more accurate {inspiral} waveforms due to low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).
For high-SNR sources, environmental {phase contributions} are relevant at low
redshift, while high-order vacuum templates are required at $z > 4$. Led by
these findings, we argue that including environmental effects in waveform
models should be prioritised in order to maximize the science yield of future

approach to constructing neural radiance fields takes advantage of multi-view
consistency and requires many calibrated views of a scene, a requirement that
cannot be satisfied when learning on large-scale image data in the wild. We
take a step towards addressing this shortcoming by introducing a model that
encodes the input image into a disentangled object representation that contains
a code for object shape, a code for object appearance, and an estimated camera
pose from which the object image is captured. Our model conditions a NeRF on
the predicted object representation and uses volume rendering to generate
images from novel views. We train the model end-to-end on a large collection of
input images. As the model is only provided with single-view images, the
problem is highly under-constrained. Therefore, in addition to using a
reconstruction loss on the synthesized input view, we use an auxiliary
adversarial loss on the novel rendered views. Furthermore, we leverage object
symmetry and cycle camera pose consistency. We conduct extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments on the ShapeNet dataset as well as qualitative
experiments on Open Images dataset. We show that in all cases, im2nerf achieves
the state-of-the-art performance for novel view synthesis from a single-view

automatic speech recognition (ASR) because of their non-autoregressive nature.
To take advantage of text-only data, language model (LM) integration approaches
such as rescoring and shallow fusion have been widely used for CTC. However,
they lose CTC's non-autoregressive nature because of the need for beam search,
which slows down the inference speed. In this study, we propose an error
correction method with phone-conditioned masked LM (PC-MLM). In the proposed
method, less confident word tokens in a greedy decoded output from CTC are
masked. PC-MLM then predicts these masked word tokens given unmasked words and
phones supplementally predicted from CTC. We further extend it to Deletable
PC-MLM in order to address insertion errors. Since both CTC and PC-MLM are
non-autoregressive models, the method enables fast LM integration. Experimental
evaluations on the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) and TED-LIUM2 in domain

shallow fusion in terms of inference speed, and also in terms of recognition

suitable training data containing action sequences, but also due to the
computational complexity of their non-autoregressive model formulation, which
does not scale well to long sequences. In this work, we address both issues.
First, we exploit the recent BABEL motion-text collection, which has a wide
range of labeled actions, many of which occur in a sequence with transitions
between them. Next, we design a Transformer-based approach that operates
non-autoregressively within an action, but autoregressively within the sequence
of actions. This hierarchical formulation proves effective in our experiments
when compared with multiple baselines. Our approach, called TEACH for ""TEmporal

stabilized the spin moment in the direction of the larger orbital moment, while
the quadrupole moment stabilized the spin moment along the longitudinal
direction of the spin-density distribution. The MCA of the magnetic materials
with TMs and their interfaces can be determined from the competition between
these two contributions. We showed that the perpendicular MCA of the
face-centered cubic (fcc) Ni with tensile tetragonal distortion arose from the
orbital moment anisotropy, whereas that of Mn-Ga alloys originated from the
quadrupole moment of spin density. In contrast, in the Co/Pd(111) multilayer

meaning pleasantness and eventfulness, using sound data collected by the
cloud-sensing method. The collected sounds comprise meta information of
recording location using Global Positioning System. Furthermore, the soundscape
impressions and sound-source features are separately assigned to the
cloud-sensing sounds by assessments defined using Swedish Soundscape-Quality
Protocol, assessing the quality of the acoustic environment. The prediction
models are built using deep neural networks with multi-layer perceptron for the
input of 10-second sound and the aerial photographs of its location. An
acoustic feature comprises equivalent noise level and outputs of octave-band
filters every second, and statistics of them in 10~s. An image feature is
extracted from an aerial photograph using ResNet-50 and autoencoder
architecture. We perform comparison experiments to demonstrate the benefit of
each feature. As a result of the comparison, aerial photographs and
sound-source features are efficient to predict impression information.
Additionally, even if the sound-source features are predicted using acoustic
and image features, the features also show fine results to predict the
soundscape impression close to the result of oracle sound-source features.

  Design with Deep Neural Networks",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Closed-loop optimal control design for high-dimensional nonlinear systems has
been a long-standing problem. Traditional methods, such as solving the
associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. Recent literature proposed a new promising approach based on
supervised learning, by leveraging powerful open-loop optimal control solvers
to generate training data and neural networks as efficient high-dimensional
function approximators to fit the closed-loop optimal control. This approach
successfully handles certain high-dimensional optimal control problems but
still performs poorly on more challenging problems. One of the crucial reasons
for the failure of the approach is the so-called distribution mismatch
phenomenon brought by the controlled dynamics. In this paper, we investigate
this phenomenon and propose the initial value problem enhanced sampling method
to mitigate this problem. We theoretically prove that this sampling strategy
improves over the vanilla strategy on the classical linear-quadratic regulator
by a factor proportional to the total time duration. We further numerically
demonstrate that the proposed sampling strategy significantly improves the
performance on tested control problems, including the optimal landing problem
of a quadrotor and the optimal reaching problem of a 7 DoF manipulator.

additional planets in the orbits close to TrES-3b and Qatar-1b are ruled out.
Possible causes of long-term TTVs such as orbital decay, apsidal precession,

  arXiv:1909.09366",,,"Themesis Technical Report THM TR2022-001 (ajm)","cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  One of the biggest challenges in characterizing 2-D topographies is
succinctly communicating the dominant nature of local configurations. In a 2-D
grid composed of bistate units, this could be expressed as finding the
characteristic configuration variables such as nearest-neighbor pairs and
triplet combinations. The 2-D cluster variation method (CVM) provides a
theoretical framework for associating a set of configuration variables with
only two parameters, for a system that is at free energy equilibrium. This work
presents a method for determining which of many possible two-parameter sets
provides the ``most suitable'' match for a given 2-D topography, drawing from
methods used for variational inference.
  This particular work focuses exclusively on topographies for which the
activation enthalpy parameter (epsilon_0) is zero, so that the distribution
between two states is equiprobable. This condition is used since, when the two
states are equiprobable, there is an analytic solution giving the configuration
variable values as functions of the h-value, where we define h in terms of the
interaction enthalpy parameter (epsilon_1) as h = exp(2*epsilon_1). This allows
the computationally-achieved configuration variable values to be compared with
the analytically-predicted values for a given h-value.
  The method is illustrated using four patterns derived from three different
naturally-occurring black-and-white topographies, where each pattern meets the
equiprobability criterion.
  We achieve expected results, that is, as the patterns progress from having
relatively low numbers of like-near-like nodes to increasing like-near-like
masses, the h-values for each corresponding free energy-minimized model also
increase. Further, the corresponding configuration variable values for the
(free energy-minimized) model patterns are in approximate alignment with the
analytically-predicted values.

the existence of both $f_{(n-1)}(x)$ and the $n$th generalized Riemann
derivative $\widetilde{D}_nf(x)$, based at $x,x+h,x+2h,x+2^2h,\ldots
,x+2^{n-1}h$. We provide a second characterization of the $n$th Peano
derivative $f_{(n)}(x)$: The existence of $f_{(n)}(x)$ is equivalent to the
existence of $f_{(n-1)}(x)$ as well as the existence of each forward shift, \[
D_{n,j}f(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} h^{-n}\sum_{i=0}^n(-1)^i\binom ni
f(x+(n+j-i)h), \] for $j=0,1,\ldots,n-2$, of the $n$th Riemann derivative
$D_{n,0}f(x)$ of a function $f$ at $x$. The proof of this result involves an
interesting combinatorial algorithm that starts with consecutive forward shifts
of an arithmetic progression and yields a geometric progression, using two
set-operations: dilation and combinatorial Gaussian elimination.
  Our result is a variant of a 1998 conjecture by Ginchev, Guerragio and Rocca,
predicting the same outcome for backward shifts instead of forward shifts. The
conjecture has been recently settled in \cite{AC2}, with a proof that has this

in the presence of channel correlations, typically encountered on the downlink
of cellular systems when the base station antennas have an insufficient
separation. In a recent paper, the authors analyzed this issue for a typical
uplink scenario with uncorrelated channels, and the study revealed an
astounding result that the optimum in terms of average error probability is
achieved when the user signals are perfectly balanced in terms of power as in
multi-user MIMO with power control. This result led to some questioning of the
concept of PD-NOMA for uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels. In the present
paper, we make a similar analysis for the downlink, and the study gives a very
clear insight into the influence of the power imbalance at different levels of
channel correlation. First, with full correlation (user signals transmitted
from the same antenna), the PD-NOMA concept reduces to simple signal
constellation design. The optimum is achieved when the power imbalance between
the user signals is such that the resulting constellation has uniform spacing.
Any deviation from this optimum will lead to a hierarchical constellation with
performance loss. Also, this optimum power imbalance is shown to hold for a
range of strong channel correlations, but for moderate and low correlation
values perfectly power balanced NOMA takes over as in the presence of
uncorrelated channels.

and below quarter-filling that realizes a number of unconventional phases. In
particular, we find an excitonic density wave in which excitons quasi-condense
with finite center of mass momentum and an order parameter that changes phase
with wave-vector $Q$. In this phase, excitons behave as hard-core bosons
without charge order. In addition, excitons can pair to form bi-excitons in a
state that is close to a charge density-wave instability. When pairing
dominates over the inter-orbital repulsion, we encounter a regime in which one
orbital is metallic, while the other forms a spin gapped superconductor, a
genuine orbital selective paired state. All these results are supported by
both, analytical and numerical calculations. By assuming a quasi-classical
approximation, we solve the three-body hole-electron-spinon problem and show
that excitons are held together by forming a bound state with spinons. In order
to preserve the antiferromagnetic background, excitons acquire a dispersion
that has a minimum away from $k=0$. The full characterization of the different
phases is obtained by means of extensive density matrix renormalization group
calculations.

generalized Riemann derivative $\widetilde{D}_nf(x)$ with nodes
$0,1,2,2^2,\ldots, 2^{n-1}$, is equivalent to the $n$-th Peano derivative
$f_{(n)}(x)$, for all $n-1$ times Peano differentiable functions $f$ at~$x$.
Call every $n$-th generalized Riemann derivative with this property an MZ
derivative. A recent paper by the authors introduced the $n$-th Gaussian
derivatives as the $n$-th generalized Riemann derivatives with nodes either
$0,1,q,q^2,\ldots ,q^{n-1}$ or $1,q,q^2,\ldots ,q^{n}$, where $q\neq 0,\pm 1$,
proved that the Gaussian derivatives are MZ derivatives, and conjectured that
these are all MZ derivatives. In this article, we invalidate the conjecture in
three different ways, by scales of generalized Riemann derivatives, by
reference to the classification of generalized Riemann derivatives, and by
means of an independent counterexample. In addition, we show that Riemann
differentiation is not equivalent to a Gaussian differentiation in orders at
least three, find an explicit description of the equivalence class of a
generalized Riemann derivative, and prove a more general quantum analogue of
the GGR Theorem. The symmetric versions of all these results are also included
in the article.

initial conditions along a Taub adiabat is used to simulate the entropy

different terrains -- the first being coastal waters -- with many obstacles,
structures and human presence while the latter is mostly devoid of such
obstacles. Variations in environmental conditions are common to both terrains.
Robust labeled datasets mapping such terrains are crucial in improving the
situational awareness that can drive autonomy. However, there are only limited
such maritime datasets available and these primarily consist of optical images.
Although, Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) is a strong complement to the optical
spectrum that helps in extreme light conditions, a labeled public dataset with
LWIR images does not currently exist. In this paper, we fill this gap by
presenting a labeled dataset of over 2,900 LWIR segmented images captured in
coastal maritime environment under diverse conditions. The images are labeled
using instance segmentation and classified in seven categories -- sky, water,
obstacle, living obstacle, bridge, self and background. We also evaluate this
dataset across three deep learning architectures (UNet, PSPNet, DeepLabv3) and
provide detailed analysis of its efficacy. While the dataset focuses on the
coastal terrain it can equally help deep sea use cases. Such terrain would have
less traffic, and the classifier trained on cluttered environment would be able
to handle sparse scenes effectively. We share this dataset with the research

for micro-CT quantitative study because of complex tomographic data analysis

contrast between solid and fluid materials, as well as large amount of data
acquired during dynamic processes. We propose a hybrid approach for automatic
segmentation of tomographic data from time-resolved imaging of methane
gas-hydrate formation in sandy granular media. First, we use an optimized 3D
U-net neural network to perform segmentation of mineral grains that are
characterized by low contrast to the surrounding pore brine-saturated phases.
Then, we perform statistical clustering based on the Gaussian mixture model for
separating the pore-space phases that are characterized by gray-level
instabilities caused by dynamic processes during hydrate formation. The
proposed approach was used for segmenting several hundred gigabytes of data
acquired during an in-situ tomographic experiment at a synchrotron. Automatic
segmentation allowed for studying properties of the hydrate growth in pores, as
well as dynamic processes such as the incremental pore-brine flow and
redistribution.

energy. The challenge is to design tunable photocatalyst to meet the needs in
different environments. At the same time, the oxygen and hydrogen evolution
reactions (OER and HER) on the photocatalyst should be separated, which will be
conducive to the separation of products. The electronic, optical and
photocatalytic properties of Janus X2PAs (X = Si, Ge and Sn) monolayers are
explored by first-principles calculation. All the strain-free X2PAs monolayers
exhibit excellent photocatalytic properties with suitable band edge positions
straddling the standard redox potential of water and large visible light
absorption coefficients (up to 105 cm-1). Interestingly, the intrinsic internal
electric field is favorable for separating photogenerated carriers to different
surfaces of the monolayer. It contributes to realize the OER and HER separated
on different sides of the monolayer. In particular, the energy band edge
positions of X2PAs monolayers can be well adjusted by biaxial strain. Then it
can effectively modulate photocatalytic reactions, suggesting X2PAs monolayers
can be a piezo-photocatalytic switch between the OER, HER and full-reaction of
redox for water splitting. This investigation not only highlights that the
photocatalyst X2PAs monolayers with the separated OER and HER can be
effectively tuned by the mechanical strain, but also provides a new strategy
for designing highly adaptable and tunable piezo-photocatalysts.

progress in robotic control in recent years. However, these methods show
obvious deterioration for new tasks that need to be completed through new
combinations of actions. RL methods heavily rely on reward functions that
cannot generalize well for new tasks, while IL methods are limited by expert
demonstrations which do not cover new tasks. In contrast, humans can easily
complete these tasks with the fragmented knowledge learned from task-agnostic
experience. Inspired by this observation, this paper proposes a task-agnostic
learning method (TAL for short) that can learn fragmented knowledge from
task-agnostic data to accomplish new tasks. TAL consists of four stages. First,
the task-agnostic exploration is performed to collect data from interactions
with the environment. The collected data is organized via a knowledge graph.
Compared with the previous sequential structure, the knowledge graph
representation is more compact and fits better for environment exploration.
Second, an action feature extractor is proposed and trained using the collected
knowledge graph data for task-agnostic fragmented knowledge learning. Third, a
candidate action generator is designed, which applies the action feature
extractor on a new task to generate multiple candidate action sets. Finally, an
action proposal is designed to produce the probabilities for actions in a new
task according to the environmental information. The probabilities are then
used to select actions to be executed from multiple candidate action sets to
form the plan. Experiments on a virtual indoor scene show that the proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art offline RL method: CQL by 35.28% and
the IL method: BC by 22.22%.

functions (OWF) are minimal for computational cryptography: They are essential
for almost any cryptographic application that cannot be realized with respect
to computationally unbounded adversaries. In the quantum setting, however, OWFs
appear not to be essential (Kretschmer 2021; Ananth et al., Morimae and
Yamakawa 2022), and the question of whether such a minimal primitive exists
remains open.
  We consider EFI pairs -- efficiently samplable, statistically far but
computationally indistinguishable pairs of (mixed) quantum states. Building on
the work of Yan (2022), which shows equivalence between EFI pairs and
statistical commitment schemes, we show that EFI pairs are necessary for a
large class of quantum-cryptographic applications. Specifically, we construct
EFI pairs from minimalistic versions of commitments schemes, oblivious
transfer, and general secure multiparty computation, as well as from
$\mathsf{QCZK}$ proofs from essentially any non-trivial language. We also
construct quantum computational zero knowledge ($\mathsf{QCZK}$) proofs for all
of $\mathsf{QIP}$ from any EFI pair.
  This suggests that, for much of quantum cryptography, EFI pairs play a
similar role to that played by OWFs in the classical setting: they are simple
to describe, essential, and also serve as a linchpin for demonstrating
equivalence between primitives.

responsible for determining the production levels of proteins and peptides.
Proteins are workers of a cell factory, and their production defines the goal
of a cell and its development. Various attempts have been made to model such
networks both to understand these biological systems better and to use
inspiration from understanding them to solve computational problems. In this
work, a biologically more realistic model for gene regulatory networks is
proposed, which incorporates Cellular Automata and Artificial Chemistry to
model the interactions between regulatory proteins called the Transcription
Factors and the regulatory sites of genes. The result of this work shows
complex dynamics close to what can be observed in nature. Here, an analysis of
the impact of the initial states of the system on the produced dynamics is
performed, showing that such evolvable models can be directed towards producing
desired protein dynamics.

of results for unsupervised clustering, within the ensemble clustering
literature. The approach of reporting results from one `best' model out of
several candidate clustering models generally ignores the uncertainty that
arises from model selection, and results in inferences that are sensitive to
the particular model and parameters chosen. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is a
popular approach for combining results across multiple models that offers some
attractive benefits in this setting, including probabilistic interpretation of
the combined cluster structure and quantification of model-based uncertainty.
  In this work we introduce clusterBMA, a method that enables weighted model
averaging across results from multiple unsupervised clustering algorithms. We
use clustering internal validation criteria to develop an approximation of the
posterior model probability, used for weighting the results from each model.
From a consensus matrix representing a weighted average of the clustering
solutions across models, we apply symmetric simplex matrix factorisation to
calculate final probabilistic cluster allocations. In addition to outperforming
other ensemble clustering methods on simulated data, clusterBMA offers unique
features including probabilistic allocation to averaged clusters, combining
allocation probabilities from 'hard' and 'soft' clustering algorithms, and
measuring model-based uncertainty in averaged cluster allocation. This method
is implemented in an accompanying R package of the same name.

survey several prime extragalactic survey areas: two fields at the North
Ecliptic Pole (NEP); seven gravitationally lensing clusters; two high redshift
proto-clusters; and the iconic backlit VV 191 galaxy system to map its dust
attenuation. PEARLS also includes NIRISS spectra for one of the NEP fields and
NIRSpec spectra of two high-redshift quasars. The main goal of PEARLS is to
study the epoch of galaxy assembly, AGN growth, and First Light. Five fields,
the JWST NEP Time-Domain Field (TDF), IRAC Dark Field (IDF), and three lensing
clusters, will be observed in up to four epochs over a year. The cadence and
sensitivity of the imaging data are ideally suited to find faint variable
objects such as weak AGN, high-redshift supernovae, and cluster caustic
transits. Both NEP fields have sightlines through our Galaxy, providing
significant numbers of very faint brown dwarfs whose proper motions can be
studied. Observations from the first spoke in the NEP TDF are public. This
paper presents our first PEARLS observations, their NIRCam data reduction and
analysis, our first object catalogs, the 0.9-4.5 $\mu$m galaxy counts and
Integrated Galaxy Light. We assess the JWST sky brightness in 13 NIRCam
filters, yielding our first constraints to diffuse light at 0.9-4.5 {\mu}m.
PEARLS is designed to be of lasting benefit to the community.

satisfy the stochastic differential equation of the form $dx_i=\sum_{j\in

standard Brownian motions with skew symmetry and $N(i)$ is the neighbour of the

associated with the diffusion is used to show that the support of an extremal
stationary state of the adjoint semigroup is an independent set of the graph.
We also investigate the diffusion with a linear drift, which gives a killing of
the dual Markov chain on a finite integer lattice. The Markov chain is used to
study the unique stationary state of the diffusion, which generalizes the
Dirichlet distribution. Two applications of the diffusions are discussed:
analysis of an algorithm to find an independent set of a graph, and a Bayesian
graph selection based on computation of probability of a sample by using

aspects of deep learning by establishing connections between neural networks
and kernel methods. Despite their importance, the utility of these kernel
methods was limited in large-scale learning settings due to their
(super-)quadratic runtime and memory complexities. Moreover, most prior works
on neural kernels have focused on the ReLU activation, mainly due to its
popularity but also due to the difficulty of computing such kernels for general
activations. In this work, we overcome such difficulties by providing methods
to work with general activations. First, we compile and expand the list of
activation functions admitting exact dual activation expressions to compute
neural kernels. When the exact computation is unknown, we present methods to
effectively approximate them. We propose a fast sketching method that
approximates any multi-layered Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) kernel
and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) matrices for a wide range of activation
functions, going beyond the commonly analyzed ReLU activation. This is done by
showing how to approximate the neural kernels using the truncated Hermite
expansion of any desired activation functions. While most prior works require
data points on the unit sphere, our methods do not suffer from such limitations
and are applicable to any dataset of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Furthermore, we
provide a subspace embedding for NNGP and NTK matrices with near input-sparsity
runtime and near-optimal target dimension which applies to any
\emph{homogeneous} dual activation functions with rapidly convergent Taylor
expansion. Empirically, with respect to exact convolutional NTK (CNTK)
computation, our method achieves $106\times$ speedup for approximate CNTK of a
5-layer Myrtle network on CIFAR-10 dataset.

scaling of today's computing systems. One main reason for the low utilization
is the temporal variation in the actual resource requirements of jobs, because
reserving resources for jobs based on the peak requirements then results in
idle resources for non-peak time. To increase utilization, in practice,
resources are often overcommitted, so jobs may need to contend for resources at
times and experience performance degradation, incurring a cost. To make use of
the flexibility in resource allocation provided by overcommitment to the best
advantage, it is critical to answer the following fundamental question that has
not been well studied: given an acceptable budget for the cost associated with
resource contention, how can we achieve the maximum utilization of the system?
  In this paper, we propose a job model that captures the time-varying resource
requirement of each job by a Markov chain. We consider a stochastic formulation
of the job dispatch problem in an infinite-server system. Our goal is to
maximize system utilization by minimizing the number of active servers (servers
running at least one job), subject to a budget on the cost of resource
contention. Our main result is the design of a job dispatch policy that is
asymptotically optimal as the job arrival rate increases. The novel technical
framework that we develop reduces the policy design problem under study to that
in a single-server system through policy conversions, which may be of
independent interest. The framework allows us to design the asymptotically
optimal policy by solving a linear program.

theoretical power consumption models for fixed-wing UAVs and single-rotor UAVs,
or provide heuristic power consumption models for multi-rotor UAVs without
rigorous mathematical derivations. This paper aims to establish theoretical
power consumption models for multi-rotor UAVs. To be specific, the closed-form
power consumption models for a multi-rotor UAV in three flight statuses, i.e.,
forward flight, vertical ascent and vertical descent, are derived by leveraging
the relationship between single-rotor UAVs and multi-rotor UAVs in terms of
power consumptions. On this basis, a generic flight power consumption model for
the UAV in a three-dimensional (3-D) scenario is obtained. Extensive
experiments are conducted by using DJI M210 and a mobile app made by DJI Mobile

models; in addition, simulations are performed to further investigate the

Adaptive Safety Control framework enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under
large uncertainties to perform safety maneuvers traditionally reserved for
human pilots with sufficient experience. In this framework, a simplified flight
model is first used for time-efficient feasibility evaluation of a set of
landing sites and trajectory generation. Then, an online path following
controller is employed to track the selected landing trajectory. We used a
high-fidelity simulation environment for a fixed-wing aircraft to test and
validate the proposed approach under various weather uncertainties. For the
case of emergency landing due to engine failure under severe weather
conditions, the simulation results show that the proposed automatic landing
framework is robust to uncertainties and adaptable at different landing stages
while being computationally inexpensive for planning and tracking tasks.

$\rm{Mg_2RE_3Sb_3O_{14}}$ $\rm{(RE=Gd, Er)}$ and $\rm{(RE=Nd)}$ have ${\bf
q=0}$, $120^\circ$ order and canted ferromagnetic (CFM) order, respectively.
Interestingly, the HK model on the KL has the same ground state long-range
orders. In the theoretical phase diagram, the CFM phase resides in a continuous
parameter region and there is no phase change across special parameter points,
such as the Kitaev ferromagnetic (KFM) point, the ferromagnetic (FM) point and
its dual FM point. However, a ground state property cannot distinguish a system
with or without topological nontrivial excitations and related phase
transitions. Here, we study the topological magnon excitations and related
thermal Hall conductivity in the HK model on the KL with CFM order. The CFM
phase can be divided into two regions related by the Klein duality, with the
self dual KFM point as their boundary. We find that the scalar spin chirality
which is intrinsic in the CFM order changes sign across the KFM point. This
leads to the opposite Chern numbers of corresponding magnon bands in the two
regions, and also the sign change of the magnon thermal Hall conductivity.

a comparison of our model with the CMSSM of flavour-conservation as the base

magnetized neutron-star crust. Although the dynamic equilibrium initially holds
without elastic displacement, the magnetic-field evolution changes the Lorentz
force over a secular timescale, which inevitably causes the elastic deformation
to settle in a new force balance. Accordingly, elastic energy is accumulated,
and the crust is eventually fractured beyond a particular threshold. We assume
that the magnetic field is axially symmetric, and we explicitly calculate the
breakup time, maximum elastic energy stored in the crust, and spatial
shear-stress distribution. For the barotropic equilibrium of a poloidal dipole
field expelled from the interior core without a toroidal field, the breakup
time corresponds to a few years for the magnetars with a magnetic field
strength of $\sim 10^{15}$G; however, it exceeds 1 Myr for normal radio
pulsars. The elastic energy stored in the crust before the fracture ranges from
$10^{41}$ to $10^{45}$ erg, depending on the spatial-energy distribution.
Generally, a large amount of energy is deposited in a deep crust. The energy
released at fracture is typically $\sim 10^{41}$ erg when the rearrangement of
elastic displacements occurs only in the fragile shallow crust. The amount of
energy is comparable to the outburst energy on the magnetars.

processing is frequently employed. This requires graph data to be divided
across nodes, and the choice of partitioning strategy has a great impact on the
execution time of the task. Yet, there is no one-size-fits-all partitioning
strategy that performs well on arbitrary graph data and algorithms. The
performance of a strategy depends on the characteristics of the graph data and
algorithms. Moreover, due to the complexity of graph data and algorithms,
manually identifying the best partitioning strategy is also infeasible. In this
work, we propose a machine learning-based approach to select the most
appropriate partitioning strategy for a given graph and processing algorithm.
Our approach enumerates viable partitioning strategies, predicts the execution
time of the target algorithm for each, and selects the partitioning strategy
with the fastest estimated execution time. Our machine learning model is
trained on features extracted from graph data and algorithm pseudo-code. We
also propose a method that augments real execution logs of graph tasks to
create a large synthetic dataset. Evaluation results show that the strategies
selected by our approach lead to 1.46X faster execution time on average
compared with the mean execution time of the partitioning strategies and about
0.95X the performance compared to the best partitioning strategy.

on the efficiency of previous treatments. Therefore, the current methods are

jointly in continuous time, by combining Gaussian processes and point

observational sequences of treatments and outcomes, and it can predict the
interventional and counterfactual progression of the outcome after an
intervention on the treatment policy (in contrast with the causal effect of a

electronics due to their atomically thin nature which withstands short channel
effects and thus enables better scalability. Device scaling is the process of
reducing all device dimensions to achieve higher device density in a certain
chip area. For 2D materials-based transistors, both the channel and contact
scalability must be investigated. The channel scalability of 2D materials has
been thoroughly investigated, confirming their resilience to short-channel
effects. However, systematic studies on contact scalability remain rare and the
current understanding of contact scaling in 2D FET is inconsistent and
oversimplified. Here we combine physically scaled contacts and asymmetrical
contact measurements to investigate the contact scaling behavior in 2D
field-effect transistors (FETs). The asymmetrical contact measurements directly
compare electron injection with different contact lengths while using the exact
same channel, eliminating channel-to-channel variations. Compared to devices
with long contact lengths, devices with short contact lengths (scaled contacts)
exhibit larger variation, smaller drain currents at high drain-source voltages,
and a higher chance of showing early saturation and negative differential
resistance. Quantum transport simulations show that the transfer length of
Ni-MoS2 contacts can be as short as 5 nm. Our results suggest that charge
injection at the source contact is different from injection at the drain side:
scaled source contacts can limit the drain current, whereas scaled drain
contacts cannot. Furthermore, we clearly identified that the transfer length
depends on the quality of the metal-2D interface. The asymmetrical contact
measurements proposed here will enable further understanding of contact scaling
behavior at various interfaces.

new framework called Image as Stepping Stone (ISS) for the task by introducing
2D image as a stepping stone to connect the two modalities and to eliminate the
need for paired text-shape data. Our key contribution is a two-stage
feature-space-alignment approach that maps CLIP features to shapes by
harnessing a pre-trained single-view reconstruction (SVR) model with multi-view
supervisions: first map the CLIP image feature to the detail-rich shape space
in the SVR model, then map the CLIP text feature to the shape space and
optimize the mapping by encouraging CLIP consistency between the input text and
the rendered images. Further, we formulate a text-guided shape stylization
module to dress up the output shapes with novel textures. Beyond existing works
on 3D shape generation from text, our new approach is general for creating
shapes in a broad range of categories, without requiring paired text-shape
data. Experimental results manifest that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-arts and our baselines in terms of fidelity and consistency with

self-gravity. The G1.75-0.08 filament was found to be subcritical by a factor
of $\sim14$ with respect to its critical line mass. G11.36+0.80 was found to be
moderately (by a factor of $\sim2$) supercritical and composed of four clumps.
The dust temperatures of the clumps are $\sim13-15$ K, and their masses are in

The projected, average separation of the clumps is $\sim1$ pc. A configuration
that is observed in G1.75-0.08, namely two clumps at the ends of the filament,
could be the result of gravitational focussing acting along the cloud. The two
clumps fulfil the mass-radius threshold for high-mass star formation. Owing to
the location of G1.75-0.08 near the Galactic centre ($\sim270$ pc),
environmental effects such as a high level of turbulence, tidal forces, and
shearing motions could affect the cloud dynamics. The observed clump separation
in G11.36+0.80 can be understood in terms of a sausage instability. The
G11.36+0.80 clumps do not lie above the mass-radius threshold for high-mass
star formation. The substructure observed in one of the clumps in G11.36+0.80
suggests that the IRDC has fragmented in a hierarchical fashion. This conforms

effectiveness for gaining resource-efficiency in DNN inference accelerators;
however, training with approximate multipliers is largely unexplored. To build
resource efficient accelerators with approximate multipliers supporting DNN
training, a thorough evaluation of training convergence and accuracy for
different DNN architectures and different approximate multipliers is needed.
This paper presents ApproxTrain, an open-source framework that allows fast
evaluation of DNN training and inference using simulated approximate
multipliers. ApproxTrain is as user-friendly as TensorFlow (TF) and requires
only a high-level description of a DNN architecture along with C/C++ functional
models of the approximate multiplier. We improve the speed of the simulation at
the multiplier level by using a novel LUT-based approximate floating-point (FP)
multiplier simulator on GPU (AMSim). ApproxTrain leverages CUDA and efficiently
integrates AMSim into the TensorFlow library, in order to overcome the absence
of native hardware approximate multiplier in commercial GPUs. We use
ApproxTrain to evaluate the convergence and accuracy of DNN training with
approximate multipliers for small and large datasets (including ImageNet) using
LeNets and ResNets architectures. The evaluations demonstrate similar
convergence behavior and negligible change in test accuracy compared to FP32
and bfloat16 multipliers. Compared to CPU-based approximate multiplier
simulations in training and inference, the GPU-accelerated ApproxTrain is more
than 2500x faster. Based on highly optimized closed-source cuDNN/cuBLAS
libraries with native hardware multipliers, the original TensorFlow is only 8x

  However, the success probability of those algorithms are all far away from 1.
Amplitude amplification is usually used to amplify success probability, but the
souffl\'e problems follow. Only stop at the right step can we achieve a maximum
success probability. Otherwise, as the number of steps increases, the success
probability may decrease, which will cause troubles in practical application of
the algorithm when the optimal number of steps is not known.
  In this work, we define generalized interpolated quantum walks, which can
both improve the success probability of search algorithms and avoid the
souffl\'e problems.
  Then we combine generalized interpolation quantum walks with quantum
fast-forwarding. The combination both reduce the times of calling walk operator
of searching algorithm from $\Theta((\varepsilon^{-1})\sqrt{\Heg})$ to
$\Theta(\log(\varepsilon^{-1})\sqrt{\Heg})$ and reduces the number of ancilla
qubits required from $\Theta(\log(\varepsilon^{-1})+\log\sqrt{\Heg})$ to
$\Theta(\log\log(\varepsilon^{-1})+\log\sqrt{\Heg})$, and the souffle problem
is avoided while the success probability is improved, where $\varepsilon$
denotes the precision and $\Heg$ denotes the classical hitting time.
  Besides, we show that our generalized interpolated quantum walks can be used
to improve the construction of quantum states corresponding to stationary
distributions as well.
  Finally, we give an application that can be used to construct a slowly
evolving Markov chain sequence by applying generalized interpolated quantum

Probabilistic multi-label classifiers provide a predictive posterior

selecting the labelset corresponding to the largest expected accuracy, over
that distribution. For example, in maximizing exact match accuracy, we provide
the mode of the distribution. But how does this relate to the confidence we may
have in such an estimate? Confidence is an important element of real-world
applications of multi-label classifiers (as in machine learning in general) and
is an important ingredient in explainability and interpretability. However, it
is not obvious how to provide confidence in the multi-label context and
relating to a particular accuracy metric, and nor is it clear how to provide a
confidence which correlates well with the expected accuracy, which would be
most valuable in real-world decision making. In this article we estimate the
expected accuracy as a surrogate for confidence, for a given accuracy metric.
We hypothesise that the expected accuracy can be estimated from the multi-label
predictive distribution. We examine seven candidate functions for their ability
to estimate expected accuracy from the predictive distribution. We found three
of these to correlate to expected accuracy and are robust. Further, we
determined that each candidate function can be used separately to estimate

multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) systems can unleash the potential of
next-generation networks by improving the performance of user equipments (UEs)
in service dead zones. However, their requirement for accurate channel state
information (CSI) is critical, and especially, applications with UE mobility
that induce channel aging make challenging the achievement of adequate quality
of service. Hence, in this work, we investigate the impact of channel aging on
the performance of RIS-assisted mMIMO systems under both spatial correlation
and imperfect CSI conditions. Specifically, by accounting for channel aging
during both uplink training and downlink data transmission phases, we first
perform minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation to obtain the UE
effective channels with low overhead similar to conventional systems without
RIS. Next, we derive the downlink achievable sum spectral efficiency (SE) with
regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding in closed-form being dependent only on
large-scale statistics by using the deterministic equivalent (DE) analysis.
Subsequently, we present the attractive optimization of the achievable sum SE
with respect to the phase shifts and the total transmit power that can be
performed every several coherence intervals due to the slow variation of the
large-scale statistics. Numerical results validate the analytical expressions
and demonstrate the performance while allowing the extraction of insightful
design conclusions for common scenarios including UE mobility. In particular,
channel aging degrades the performance but its impact can be controlled by
choosing appropriately the frame duration or by increasing the number of RIS
elements.

preserved the scalability of the original method thanks to the Apache Spark

only a few variables. We designed a graphical representation based on

speech recognition (ASR) performance in the single-talker case, it remains
difficult to recognize multi-talker speech in which many voices overlap. One
conventional approach to tackle this problem is to use a cascade of a speech
separation or target speech extraction front-end with an ASR back-end. However,
the extra computation costs of the front-end module are a critical barrier to
quick response, especially for streaming ASR. In this paper, we propose a
target-speaker ASR (TS-ASR) system that implicitly integrates the target speech
extraction functionality within a streaming end-to-end (E2E) ASR system, i.e.
recurrent neural network-transducer (RNNT). Our system uses a similar idea as
adopted for target speech extraction, but implements it directly at the level
of the encoder of RNNT. This allows TS-ASR to be realized without placing extra
computation costs on the front-end. Note that this study presents two major
differences between prior studies on E2E TS-ASR; we investigate streaming
models and base our study on Conformer models, whereas prior studies used
RNN-based systems and considered only offline processing. We confirm in
experiments that our TS-ASR achieves comparable recognition performance with
conventional cascade systems in the offline setting, while reducing computation
costs and realizing streaming TS-ASR.

point numbers are extensively utilized due to their expressiveness. Nowadays
performing data analysis on embedded devices from dynamic data masses becomes
available, but such systems often lack hardware capabilities to process
floating point numbers, introducing large overheads for their processing. Even
if such hardware is present in general computing systems, using integer
operations instead of floating point operations promises to reduce operation
overheads and improve the performance.
  In this paper, we provide \mdname, a full precision floating point comparison
for random forests, by only using integer and logic operations. To ensure the
same functionality preserves, we formally prove the correctness of this
comparison. Since random forests only require comparison of floating point
numbers during inference, we implement \mdname~in low level realizations and
therefore eliminate the need for floating point hardware entirely, by keeping
the model accuracy unchanged. The usage of \mdname~basically boils down to a
one-by-one replacement of conditions: For instance, a comparison statement in
C: if(pX[3]<=(float)10.074347) becomes
if((*(((int*)(pX))+3))<=((int)(0x41213087))). Experimental evaluation on X86

advancements in several core aspects like communication efficiency, handling
non-IID data, privacy, and security capabilities. However, the majority of FL
works only deal with supervised tasks, assuming that clients' training sets are

in this paper, we aim to extend the FL paradigm to unsupervised tasks by
addressing the problem of anomaly detection in decentralized settings. In
particular, we propose a novel method in which, through a preprocessing phase,
clients are grouped into communities, each having similar majority (i.e.,
inlier) patterns. Subsequently, each community of clients trains the same
anomaly detection model (i.e., autoencoders) in a federated fashion. The
resulting model is then shared and used to detect anomalies within the clients
of the same community that joined the corresponding federated process.
Experiments show that our method is robust, and it can detect communities
consistent with the ideal partitioning in which groups of clients having the
same inlier patterns are known. Furthermore, the performance is significantly
better than those in which clients train models exclusively on local data and

significant progress, most of them are still faced with three limitations.
First, they often suffer from high computational complexity, which restricts
their applications in large-scale scenarios. Second, they usually perform graph
learning either at the single-view level or at the view-consensus level, but
often neglect the possibility of the joint learning of single-view and
consensus graphs. Third, many of them rely on the k-means for discretization of
the spectral embeddings, which lack the ability to directly learn the graph
with discrete cluster structure. In light of this, this paper presents an
efficient multi-view clustering approach via unified and discrete bipartite
graph learning (UDBGL). Specifically, the anchor-based subspace learning is
incorporated to learn the view-specific bipartite graphs from multiple views,
upon which the bipartite graph fusion is leveraged to learn a view-consensus
bipartite graph with adaptive weight learning. Further, the Laplacian rank
constraint is imposed to ensure that the fused bipartite graph has discrete
cluster structures (with a specific number of connected components). By
simultaneously formulating the view-specific bipartite graph learning, the
view-consensus bipartite graph learning, and the discrete cluster structure
learning into a unified objective function, an efficient minimization algorithm
is then designed to tackle this optimization problem and directly achieve a
discrete clustering solution without requiring additional partitioning, which
notably has linear time complexity in data size. Experiments on a variety of
multi-view datasets demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our UDBGL
approach. The code is available at https://github.com/huangdonghere/UDBGL.

recognition. Speech recognition that is based on natural language processing is
one of the essential elements in the conversion of one system to another. In
this paper, we created an interface that transforms speech and other auditory
inputs into text using a digital filter. Contrary to the many methods for this
conversion, it is also possible for linguistic faults to appear occasionally,
gender recognition, speech recognition that is unsuccessful (cannot recognize
voice), and gender recognition to fail. Since technical problems are involved,
we developed a program that acts as a mediator to prevent initiating software
issues in order to eliminate even this little deviation. Its planned MFCC and

avoided.

continuous extension of the finite discrete Gabor transform from the lattice

interacting Fe nanoparticles is found in Fe-Ag granular multilayers.
Interaction of Fe particles located in neighboring Fe layers is studied as a
function of the nominal thickness of the Ag layer in between only two Fe
layers. The surprisingly increasing interaction with increasing Ag-layer
thickness, verified by memory-effect measurements, is explained by the
formation of pinholes in the Ag layer at small Ag thicknesses, allowing direct
ferromagnetic coupling between Fe particles in neighboring Fe layers which may
hinder the frustration of superspins favored by dipolar interactions. At larger
Ag thicknesses, the Ag layer is continuous without pinholes and frustration
leads to the appearance of the superspin-glass state. The effect of increasing
interactions correlates well with the growing deviation at low temperatures of
the measured field-cooled (FC) magnetization from the interaction-free FC curve
calculated by a model based on the relaxation of two-level systems. Similar
phenomenon is reported in a recently published paper (S\'anchez et al., Small
2022, 18, 2106762) where a dense nanoparticle system is studied. The collective
magnetic behavior of the particles due to dipolar interactions is suppressed
when the anisotropy energy of the individual particles exceeds a certain
threshold.

that the exchange can happen during on-surface diffusion, where the cost of the

stellar and planetary mass measurements, and joint analysis of data from
multiple observational methods can both lift degeneracies and improve
precision. We set out to measure the masses of individual stars in binary
systems using all the information brought by the Hipparcos and Gaia absolute
astrometric missions. We present BINARYS, a tool which uses the Hipparcos and
Gaia absolute astrometric data and combines it with relative astrometry and/or
radial velocity measurements to determine the orbit of a binary system. It
rigorously combines the Hipparcos and Gaia data (here EDR3), and it can use the
Hipparcos Transit Data as needed for binaries where Hipparcos detect
significant flux from the secondary component. It also support the case where
Gaia resolved the system, giving an astrometric solution for both components.
We determine model-independent individual masses for the first time for three
systems: the two mature binaries Gl~494 ($M_1=0.584 \pm 0.003 M_{\odot}$ and
$M_2=87 \pm 1 M_{\textrm{Jup}}$) and HIP~88745 ($M_1=0.96 \pm 0.02 M_{\odot}$
and $M_2= 0.60^{+ 0.02 }_{- 0.01 } M_{\odot}$), and the younger AB Dor member
GJ~2060 ($M_1=0.60 ^{+ 0.06}_{- 0.05} M_{\odot}$ and $M_2=0.45 ^{+ 0.06}_{-
0.05}M_{\odot}$). The latter provides a rare test of evolutionary model
predictions at young ages in the low stellar-mass range and sets a lower age
limit of 100~Myr for the moving group.

real-word and complex applicative scenarios compared to the traditional

this paper we propose a new framework, named Selecting Related Knowledge for
Online Continual Learning (SRKOCL), which incorporates an additional efficient
channel attention mechanism to pick the particular related knowledge for every

circumvent the catastrophic forgetting. Finally, extensive experiments are

identification of the corresponding subsequences in transient multivariate
time-series data (MTSD). The analysis of such data has become more and more
important due to the increase of availability in many industrial fields.
Labeling, sorting or filtering highly transient measurement data for training
condition based maintenance (CbM) models is cumbersome and error-prone. For
some applications it can be sufficient to filter measurements by simple
thresholds or finding change-points based on changes in mean value and
variation. But a robust diagnosis of a component within a component group for
example, which has a complex non-linear correlation between multiple sensor
values, a simple approach would not be feasible. No meaningful and coherent
measurement data which could be used for training a CbM model would emerge.
Therefore, we introduce an algorithm which uses a recurrent neural network
(RNN) based Autoencoder (AE) which is iteratively trained on incoming data. The
scoring function uses the reconstruction error and latent space information. A
model of the identified subsequence is saved and used for recognition of
repeating subsequences as well as fast offline clustering. For evaluation, we
propose a new similarity measure based on the curvature for a more intuitive
time-series subsequence clustering metric. A comparison with seven other
state-of-the-art algorithms and eight datasets shows the capability and the
increased performance of our algorithm to cluster MTSD online and offline in
conjunction with mechatronic systems.

  Information based on Metapath","32 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  graph neural networks (GNNs) are the dominant paradigm for modeling and
handling graph structure data by learning universal node representation. The
traditional way of training GNNs depends on a great many labeled data, which
results in high requirements on cost and time. In some special scene, it is
even unavailable and impracticable. Self-supervised representation learning,
which can generate labels by graph structure data itself, is a potential
approach to tackle this problem. And turning to research on self-supervised
learning problem for heterogeneous graphs is more challenging than dealing with
homogeneous graphs, also there are fewer studies about it. In this paper, we
propose a SElfsupervised learning method for heterogeneous graph via Structure
Information based on Metapath (SESIM). The proposed model can construct pretext
tasks by predicting jump number between nodes in each metapath to improve the
representation ability of primary task. In order to predict jump number, SESIM
uses data itself to generate labels, avoiding time-consuming manual labeling.
Moreover, predicting jump number in each metapath can effectively utilize graph
structure information, which is the essential property between nodes.
Therefore, SESIM deepens the understanding of models for graph structure. At
last, we train primary task and pretext tasks jointly, and use meta-learning to
balance the contribution of pretext tasks for primary task. Empirical results
validate the performance of SESIM method and demonstrate that this method can
improve the representation ability of traditional neural networks on link
prediction task and node classification task.

proton-proton collisions decreases as final state particle multiplicity
increases. Moreover, the ALICE experiment at CERN has observed that the number
of deuterons produced increases with multiplicity, a behavior that is
qualitatively different from that of the $X(3872)$. These experimental findings
may point to a compact structure for the $X(3872)$ or, at least, that its
hadronization could proceed through a charm-anticharm core. We have recently
used a diffusion Monte Carlo method to solve the many-body Schr\""odinger
equation that describes the $X(3872)$ as a $c \bar c q \bar q$ tetraquark
system with quantum numbers $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(1^{++})$ and $1^-(1^{++})$.
According to our structural analysis, the quark--(anti-)quark correlations
resemble light-meson--heavy-meson molecules of type $\omega J/\psi$ and $\rho
J/\psi$, rather than the most extended $D\bar D^{\ast}$ interpretation. It was
argued that this fact may be the key to make compatible the molecular features
of the $X(3872)$ with its production observables. The same formalism allows us
to compute the first color excited $c \bar c q \bar q$ tetraquark state with
either $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(1^{++})$ or $1^-(1^{++})$. A bound-state is found in
each channel, their masses are around 4.0 GeV which is an energy region where
many new exotic candidates have been collected by the Particle Data Group.
Concerning their structural properties, these states cluster in a compact
diquark-antidiquark arrangement which matches perfectly with a so-called
Born-Oppenheimer tetraquark configuration. The promptly production rates of
these states in proton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions
should fall off equal to or even faster than those of the $X(3872)$.

(PtCO)2 dimers, formed dynamically through the agglomeration of mobile

CO2. Pt2 dimers produce one CO2 molecule before falling apart into two adatoms,
releasing the second CO. Interestingly, Olattice extraction only becomes facile

second exploring extracted admission representations in a recurrent-based

clinical outcomes, unexpected patient readmission and disease progression,
using the publicly available MIMIC-III clinical database. The results obtained
demonstrate the potential of the first architecture to model readmission and
diagnoses prediction using single patient admissions. While information from

which magnon blockade in a cavity magnonic system is possible provided that the
Kerr nonlinearity is much stronger than the cavity and magnonic mode
dissipation rates. In the present contribution, we consider a PT-symmetric
cavity magnonic system and study the effect of PT-symmetric phase on the magnon

which is achievable by properly selecting the system parameters, can relax the
requirement of large Kerr nonlinearity such that a perfect magnon blockade can
be easily obtained even under a small value of Kerr nonlinearity. Surprisingly,
although there is no photonic Kerr nonlinearity in the scheme, photon blockade
can also occur simultaneously with magnon blockade. This result is arising from

techniques. The increasing number of papers recently published in this domain,

attention of the community due to efficiency and good accuracy in systems with
high-dimensional data. However, many DL methodologies have complex structures
that are not readily transparent to human users. Accessing the interpretability
of these models is an essential factor for addressing problems in sensitive
areas such as cyber-security systems, medical, financial surveillance, and
industrial processes. Fuzzy logic systems (FLS) are inherently interpretable
models, well known in the literature, capable of using nonlinear
representations for complex systems through linguistic terms with membership
degrees mimicking human thought. Within an atmosphere of explainable artificial
intelligence, it is necessary to consider a trade-off between accuracy and
interpretability for developing intelligent models. This paper aims to
investigate the state-of-the-art on existing methodologies that combine DL and
FLS, namely deep fuzzy systems, to address regression problems, configuring a
topic that is currently not sufficiently explored in the literature and thus

significantly leads to misdiagnosis. This paper addresses the issue of
improving the retinal image quality and vessel segmentation through retinal
image restoration. More specifically, a cycle-consistent generative adversarial
network (CycleGAN) with a convolution block attention module (CBAM) is used for
retinal image restoration. A modified UNet is used for retinal vessel
segmentation for the restored retinal images (CBAM-UNet). The proposed model
consists of two generators and two discriminators. Generators translate images
from one domain to another, i.e., from low to high quality and vice versa.
Discriminators classify generated and original images. The retinal vessel
segmentation model uses downsampling, bottlenecking, and upsampling layers to
generate segmented images. The CBAM has been used to enhance the feature
extraction of these models. The proposed method does not require paired image
datasets, which are challenging to produce. Instead, it uses unpaired data that
consists of low- and high-quality fundus images retrieved from publicly
available datasets. The restoration performance of the proposed method was
evaluated using full-reference evaluation metrics, e.g., peak signal-to-noise
ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM). The retinal vessel
segmentation performance was compared with the ground-truth fundus images. The
proposed method can significantly reduce the degradation effects caused by
out-of-focus blurring, color distortion, low, high, and uneven illumination.
Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method for retinal
image restoration and vessel segmentation.

($b>b_E$). Here, $b$ is additional parameter due to charge and the value $b=b_E
\approx 0.226$ corresponds to an extremal black hole with degenerate horizons.
Interestingly, the spacetime admits photon sphere for $0<b\leq b_P \approx
0.247$ and an anti-photon sphere only for $b_E < b \leq b_P$. With no-horizon
spacetime, images by lensing from the inside of the photon sphere ($u<u_{ps}$)
can also appear. Interestingly, for the case $u<u_{ps}$ the deflection angle
$\alpha_D$ increases with $u$. We analyse the lensing observables by modelling
compact objects Sgr A*, M87*, NGC4649, and NGC1332 as black holes and
no-horizon spacetimes. The angular position $\theta_{\infty}$ and photon sphere
radius $x_{ps}$ decrease with increasing parameter $b$. Our findings suggest
that the angular separations ($s$) and magnification ($r$) of relativistic
images inside the photon sphere may be higher than those outside. Moreover, the
time delay for Sgr A* and M87* can reach $\sim$ 8.8809 min and $\sim$ 12701.8
min, respectively, at $b = 0.2$, deviating from Schwarzschild black holes by
$\sim$ 2.615 min and $\sim$ 4677 min. These deviations are insignificant for
Sgr A* because it is too small, but they are sufficient for astronomical
observation of M87* and some other black holes. With EHT bounds on
$\theta_{sh}$ of Sgr A* and M 87*, within $1 \sigma$ region, placing bounds on
the parameter $b$, our analysis concludes that the REC black holes agree with
the EHT results in finite space, whereas the corresponding REC no-horizon
spacetimes are completely ruled out.

surrounding the quasar host are unusual and complex, with redshifted and
blueshifted spiral-like structures. The emission velocities at 5-10 kpc from

optical frequencies. In this study, we report a metal-insulator-metal (MIM)
diode with a strongly enhanced electric field achieved via the self-assembly of
uniform Pt nanoparticles (NPs) using atomic layer deposition. An enhancement of
several orders of magnitude in the current density and asymmetry of this system

in the higher-resolution EUI data compared with the AIA data. Furthermore, the
same system of loops exhibits many of these decayless oscillations on Day-2,
while on Day-3, we detect very few oscillations and on Day-1, we find none at
all. Analysis of photospheric magnetic field data reveals that at most times,
these loops were rooted in sunspots, where supergranular flows are generally
absent. This suggests that supergranular flows, which are often invoked as
drivers of decayless waves, are not necessarily driving such oscillations in
our observations. Similarly, our findings also cast doubt on other possible
drivers of these waves, such as a transient driver or mode conversion of
longitudinal waves near the loop footpoints. In conclusion, through our
analysis we find that none of the commonly suspected sources proposed to drive
decayless oscillations in active region loops seems to be operating in this

StyleGAN so that a video corresponds to a trajectory through the latent space.
Training the network is in two stages. The first stage is to model trajectories
in the latent space conditioned on speech utterances. To do this, we use an
existing encoder to invert the generator, mapping from each video frame into
the latent space. We train a recurrent neural network to map from speech
utterances to displacements in the latent space of the image generator. These
displacements are relative to the back-projection into the latent space of an
identity image chosen from the individuals depicted in the training dataset. In
the second stage, we improve the visual quality of the generated videos by
tuning the image generator on a single image or a short video of any chosen
identity. We evaluate our model on standard measures (PSNR, SSIM, FID and LMD)

one of two commonly used datasets and gives comparable performance on the

the irrelevant features that can be removed to reduce the computational

water into planet-forming materials$^{5}$. The truth is that the Earth-Moon and
other planetary objects deviate positively from the Sun by ~6 % in their
isotopic compositions. A stunning exception is the magnetite/sulfide
symplectite found in Acfer 094 meteorite, which shows 24 % enrichment in
$^{17,18}$O relative to the Sun$^{6}$. Water does not explain the enrichment
this high. Here we show that the SO and SO$_2$ molecules in the molecular

protoplanetary disk and planetesimal stages to become a sulfuric acid, 24 %
enriched in $^{17,18}$O. The sulfuric acid provided a cryofluid environment in
the planetesimal and by itself reacted with ferric iron to form an amorphous
ferric-hydroxysulfate-hydrate, which eventually decomposed into the symplectite

years. While there has been much success developing new synthesis methods, a
fundamental disconnect exists between most experiments and the theoretical
computations used to model them. The real catalysts are based on powder
supports, which inevitably contain a multitude of different facets, different
surface sites, defects, hydroxyl groups, and other contaminants due to the
environment. This makes it extremely difficult to determine the structure of
the active SAC site using current techniques. To be tractable, computations
aimed at modelling SAC utilize periodic boundary conditions and low index
facets of an idealized support. Thus the reaction barriers and mechanisms
determined computationally represent, at best, a plausibility argument, and
there is a strong chance that some critical aspect is omitted. One way to
better understand what is plausible is by experimental modelling, i.e.
comparing the results of computations to experiments based on precisely defined
single-crystalline supports prepared in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environment.
In this article, we review the status of the surface science literature as it
pertains to SAC. We focus on experimental work on supports where the site of
the metal atom are unambiguously determined from experiment, in particular the
surfaces of rutile and anatase TiO2, the iron oxides Fe2O3 and Fe3O4, as well
as CeO2 and MgO. Much of this work is based on scanning probe microscopy in
conjunction with spectroscopy, and we highlight the remarkably few studies in
which metal atoms are stable on low index surfaces of typical supports. In a
perspective, we discuss the possibility for expanding such studies into other

process in which a stack of discontinuous fiber-reinforced thermoset sheets is
formed in a hot mold. The reorientation of fibers during this molding process
can be either described by macroscale models based on Jeffery's equation or by
direct mesoscale simulations of individual fiber bundles. In complex geometries
and for long fibers, direct bundle simulations outperform the accuracy of
state-of-the-art macroscale approaches in terms of fiber orientation and fiber
volume fraction. However, it remains to be shown that they are able to predict
the necessary compression forces considering non-isothermal, non-Newtonian and
compaction behavior. In this contribution, both approaches are applied to the
elongational flow in a press rheometer and compared to experiments with 23%
glass fiber volume fraction. The results show that both models predict
contributions to the total compression force and orientation reasonably well
for short flow paths. For long flow paths and thick stacks, complex deformation
mechanisms arise and potential origins for deviation between simulations models
and experimental observations are discussed. Furthermore, Jeffery's basic model
is able to predict orientations similar to the high-fidelity mesoscale model.
For planar SMC flow, this basic model appears to be even better suited than the
more advanced orientation models with diffusion terms developed for injection
molding.

Let $R$ and $B$ be two disjoint sets of red and blue points in the plane, and
$\mathcal{O}$ be a set of $k \geq 2$ lines passing through the origin. We study
the problem of computing the set of orientations of the lines of $\mathcal{O}$
for which the $\mathcal{O}$-convex hull of $R$ contains no points of $B$.
  For $k=2$ orthogonal lines we have the rectilinear convex hull. In optimal
$O(n \log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space, $n = \vert R \vert + \vert B \vert$, we
compute the set of rotation angles such that, after simultaneously rotating the
lines of $\mathcal{O}$ around the origin in the same direction, the rectilinear
convex hull of $R$ contains no points of $B$. We generalize this result to the
case where $\mathcal{O}$ is formed by $k \geq 2$ lines with arbitrary
orientations. In the counter-clockwise circular order of the lines of
$\mathcal{O}$, let $\alpha_i$ be the angle required to clockwise rotate the

rotates by an angle that goes from $0$ to $\pi$. We show that this last case
can also be solved in optimal $O(n\log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space, where $n =

in cosmic rays were based on experiments underground or at high altitudes.
However, there have been few searches for FCPs in cosmic rays carried out in
orbit other than AMS-01 flown by a space shuttle and BESS by a balloon at the
top of the atmosphere. In this study, we conduct an FCP search in space based
on on-orbit data obtained using the DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE)

require an FCP energy of the order of hundreds of GeV, our FCP search starts at
only a few GeV. An upper limit of $6.2\times 10^{-10}~~\mathrm{cm^{-2}sr^{-1}

higher sensitivity than experiments of similar types by three orders of

gravity at cosmological distances. In particular, this leads to the leakage of
gravitational waves from the brane into an extra dimension at large distances
from the source. However, the calculation of the gravitational wave leakage
intensity is a non-trivial task due to the violation of the Huygens principle
in the five-dimensional bulk of the DGP setup. The odd dimension of the bulk
makes it difficult to extract the radiated part of the field. In this paper, we
consider a simplified problem of scalar radiation from a point charge localized
on a brane in the framework of the scalar field analog of the DGP model. In
this model, the scalar field on the brane can be represented as a continuous
spectrum of Kaluza-Klein massive modes. To extract the emitted part of such a
field, we generalize the Rohrlich-Teitelboim approach to radiation to the case
of a massive four-dimensional field, using its connections to massless fields
in four and five dimensions. In the case of a charge moving along a circular
trajectory, we obtain the dependence of the radiation energy flux through a
2-sphere localized on the brane on the sphere radius, which provides the
intensity of leakage of scalar radiation from the brane. Consistent with the
infrared transparency of the bulk, the leakage intensity is found to be higher

we present a modified approach for plasmonic materials that requires
considerably fewer fit parameters than traditional approaches. Specifically, we
consider the underlying microscopic theory and, in the frequency domain,
separate the hydrodynamic contributions of the quasi-free electrons in
partially filled bands from the interband transitions. As an illustration, we
apply our approach to gold and demonstrate how to treat the interband
transitions within the effective model via connecting to the underlying
electronic bandstructure, thereby assigning physical meaning to the remaining
fit parameters. Finally, we show how to utilize this approach within the
technique of auxiliary differential equations. Our approach can be extended to
other plasmonic materials and leads to efficient time-domain simulations of
plasmonic structures for frequency ranges where interband transitions have to
be considered.

For decades already traders have been citing the price of uncertainty based FX
optional contracts in terms of implied volatility, a dummy variable related to
the standard deviation, instead of pricing with units of money. This work
introduces a methodology for geometric representation of probability in terms
of implied volatility and attempts to find ways to approximate certain
probability distributions using intuitive geometric symmetry. In particular, it
is shown how any probability distribution supported on $\mathbb{R}_{+}$ and
having finite expectation may be represented with a planar curve whose
geometric characteristics can be further analyzed. Log-normal distributions are
represented with circles centered at the origin. Certain non-log-normal
distributions with bell-shaped density profiles are represented by curves that
can be closely approximated with circles whose centers are translated away from
the origin. Only three points are needed to define a circle while it represents
the candidate probability density approximating the distribution along the
entire $\mathbb{R}_{+}$. Just three numbers: scaling and translations along the
$x$ and $y$ axes map one circle to another. It is possible to introduce
equivalence classes whose member distributions can be obtained by transitive
actions of geometric transformations on any of corresponding representations.
Approximate completion of probability with non-circular shapes and cases when
probability is supported outside of $\mathbb{R}_{+}$ are considered too.
Proposed completion of implied volatility is compared to the vanna-volga
method.

(MPLP) , a special case of the Location-Routing Problem (LRP) which determines
the optimal stopover location for MPLs throughout the day and plans
corresponding delivery routes. A Hybrid Q Learning Network based Method (HQM)
is developed to resolve the computational complexity of the resulting large
problem instances while escaping local optima. In addition, the HQM is
integrated with global and local search mechanisms to resolve the dilemma of
exploration and exploitation faced by classic reinforcement learning methods.
We examine the performance of HQM under different problem sizes (up to 200
nodes) and benchmarked it against the exact approach and Genetic Algorithm
(GA). Our results indicate that HQM achieves better optimisation performance
with shorter computation time than the exact approach solved by the Gurobi
solver in large problem instances. Additionally, the average reward obtained by
HQM is 1.96 times greater than GA, which demonstrates that HQM has a better
optimisation ability. Further, we identify critical factors that contribute to
fleet size requirements, travel distances, and service delays. Our findings
outline that the efficiency of MPLs is mainly contingent on the length of time
windows and the deployment of MPL stopovers. Finally, we highlight managerial

randomly distributed feedback, the build-up of RFL shows continuous Verhulst

different from the step-like growth curve of conventional fiber lasers.
Furthermore, the radiation build-up duration is inversely related to the pump

density increase to spectral broadening. From steady-state to pump switch-off
state, the RFL output power dissipates immediately, and the remaining Stokes

round-trip. This work provides new insights into the transient dynamics

Communications (ISAC) - widely seen as an attractive proposition to achieve
high performance for both functionalities, while efficiently utilizing
available resources -- lies in leveraging information-bearing channel-coded
communications signals (c.c.s) for sensing. In this paper, we investigate the
sensing performance of c.c.s in (multi-user) interference-limited operation,
and show that it is limited by sidelobes in the range-Doppler map, whose form
depends on whether the c.c.s modulates a single-carrier or OFDM waveform. While
uncoded communications signals -- comprising a block of $N$ i.i.d zero-mean
symbols -- give rise to asymptotically (i.e., as $N \rightarrow \infty$) zero
sidelobes due to the law of large numbers, it is not obvious that the same
holds for c.c.s, as structured channel coding schemes (e.g., linear block
codes) induce dependence across codeword symbols. In this paper, we show that
c.c.s also give rise to asymptotically zero sidelobes -- for both
single-carrier and OFDM waveforms -- by deriving upper bounds for the tail
probabilities of the sidelobe magnitudes that decay as $\exp( - O($code rate
$\times$ block length$))$. This implies that for any code rate, c.c.s are
effective sensing signals that are robust to multi-user interference at
sufficiently large block lengths, with negligible difference in performance
based on whether they modulate a single-carrier or OFDM waveform. We verify the
latter implication through simulations, where we observe the sensing
performance (characterized by the detection and false-alarm probabilities) of a
QPSK-modulated c.c.s (code rate = 120/1024, block length = 1024 symbols) to

limited applications, such as healthy aging and structural degeneration in
Alzheimer's Disease. In this article, we present novel modifications to deep
learning architectures for MS FLAIR image synthesis, in order to support
prediction of longitudinal images in a flexible continuous way. This is
achieved with learned transposed convolutions, which support modelling time as
a spatially distributed array with variable temporal properties at different

spatially-specific time-dependent brain development, supporting the modelling
of more rapid growth at appropriate physical locations, such as the site of an

far into the future a predicted examination should target. Accurate prediction
of future rounds of imaging can inform clinicians of potentially poor patient

photon-dominated regions (PDRs). Their properties vary with the local physical
conditions and affect the local chemistry and dynamics. Aims. We aim to
highlight the evolution of carbonaceous nano-grains in three different PDRs and
propose a scenario of dust evolution as a response to the physical conditions.
Methods. We used Spitzer/IRAC (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8 $\mu$m) and Spitzer/MIPS
(24 $\mu$m) together with Herschel/PACS (70 $\mu$m) to map dust emission in
IC63 and the Orion Bar. To assess the dust properties, we modelled the dust
emission in these regions using the radiative transfer code SOC together with
the THEMIS dust model. Results. Regardless of the PDR, we find that nano-grains
are depleted and that their minimum size is larger than in the diffuse ISM
(DISM), which suggests that the mechanisms that lead nano-grains to be
photo-destroyed are very efficient below a given critical size limit. The
evolution of the nano-grain dust-to-gas mass ratio with both G0 and the
effective temperature of the illuminating star indicates a competition between
the nano-grain formation through the fragmentation of larger grains and
nano-grain photo-destruction. We modelled dust collisions driven by radiative
pressure with a classical 1D approach to show that this is a viable scenario
for explaining nano-grain formation through fragmentation and, thus, the
variations observed in nano-grain dust-to-gas mass ratios from one PDR to
another. Conclusions. We find a broad variation in the nano-grain dust
properties from one PDR to another, along with a general trend of nano-grain
depletion in these regions. We propose a viable scenario of nano-grain
formation through fragmentation of large grains due to radiative
pressure-induced collisions.

symmetry-protected topological phases and we analyze the sums of the strange
correlators, pointing out that integrating their moduli substantially reduces
cancellations and finite-size effects. We also analyze instances of systems
hosting intrinsic topological order, as well as strange correlators between
states with different nontrivial topologies. Our results for both translational

deep-learning approaches represented the principal solution to the Action
Recognition problem. However, most models often require a large dataset of

because they can deal with just a single instance for class. Unfortunately,
One-Shot models assume that, at inference time, the action to recognize falls
into the support set and they fail when the action lies outside the support
set. Few-Shot Open-Set Recognition (FSOSR) solutions attempt to address that
flaw, but current solutions consider only static images and not sequences of

sitting-down and standing-up. In this paper we propose a novel model that

study the pole-skipping phenomenon of the holographic correlators of boundary

with the models of $U(1)$-gauged form fields propagating in the asymptotic AdS
bulk of finite temperature. In general, in different cases all the first-order
points are located at the Matsubara frequency with corresponding wave vectors
regularly dispersed in the momentum space. Specifically, in the massless cases
with $U(1)$ symmetry, the wave vectors of the pole-skipping points have a
form-number dependence, and a trans-mode equivalence in the dual fields is
found in correspondence with electromagnetic duality. In the massive cases with
explicit symmetry breaking, we find that the appearance of a non-zero mass
yields extra pole-skipping points which reduce to the massless results in zero
mass limit. We expect in such kind of pole-skipping properties implications of
distinctive physics in the chaotic systems. Our near-horizon computation is
verified with the double-trace method especially in the example of 2-form where
there is dimension-dependent boundary divergence. We illustrate in these cases
that the pole-skipping properties of the holographic correlators are determined
by the IR physics, consistent with the ordinary cases in previous studies.

work we show for the first time how phase transitions for realistic TGFT models

spacelike tetrahedra whose quantum geometry is encoded in non-local degrees of

employed as a matter reference frame. We apply the Ginzburg criterion finding
that fluctuations around the non-vanishing mean-field vacuum remain small at
large correlation lengths regardless of the combinatorics of the non-local
interaction validating the mean-field theory description of the phase
transition. This work represents a first crucial step to understand phase
transitions in compelling TGFT models for quantum gravity and paves the way for
a more complete analysis via functional renormalization group techniques.

completion have begun taking traction as effective means of inferring a
complete 3D object representation from partial visual data. Nevertheless, most

scaling up the neural network outputs is computationally expensive. In this

feedstocks in powder bed additive manufacturing methods. Rollers are often
employed when spreading powders with limited flowability, as arises in powders
comprising fine particle sizes or high surface energy materials. Here, we study
roller-based powder spreading for powder bed AM using the unique combination of
a purpose-built powder spreading testbed with a proven method for X-ray mapping
of powder layer depth. We focus on the density and uniformity of nominally 100
micrometer thick layers of roller-spread Ti-6Al-4V and Al-10Si-Mg powders. Our
results indicate that when rotation is too rapid, roller-applied shear force
impedes the creation of dense and uniform layers from powders of high innate
flowability, or where inertial forces driven by particle density dominate
cohesive forces. Roller counter-rotation augments the uniformity of cohesive
powder layers, primarily though reducing the influence of particle clusters in
the flowing powder, which are otherwise shown to cause deep, trench-like
streaks. Companion discrete element method (DEM) simulations further
contextualize the experiments through isolation of the effects of cohesion on
layer attributes. Results suggest that roller motion parameters could apply a
strategic level of additional shear force to the flowing powder, thereby
mitigating the clumping behavior characteristic of highly cohesive feedstocks
while maintaining high layer uniformity.

near-infrared, and of 1.3 mag in g band. We studied the variability of selected
emission lines that trace the accretion, computed the accretion luminosity and
the mass accretion rate using empirical relations and obtained values of the
accretion luminosity between 1.6 and 3.2 Lsun and mass accretion rate between
3.31x10{-7} Msun/yr and 7.76x10^{-7} Msun/yr. Our results show that WX Cha is
accreting at a rate larger than what is typical for T Tauri stars in the same

due to the higher disk mass of WX Cha than what is usual for stars with similar

method for extracting non-Gaussian information from galaxy surveys. The
two-point correlation function (2PCF) provides a complete statistical
description of a Gaussian density field. However, the late-time density field
becomes non-Gaussian due to non-linear gravitational evolution and higher-order
summary statistics are required to capture all of its cosmological information.
Using a Fisher formalism based on halo catalogues from the Quijote simulations,
we explore the possibility of retrieving this information using the
density-split clustering (DS) method, which combines clustering statistics from
regions of different environmental density. We show that DS provides more
precise constraints on the parameters of the $\nu \Lambda$CDM model compared to
the 2PCF, and we provide suggestions for where the extra information may come
from. DS improves the constraints on the sum of neutrino masses by a factor of
$7$ and by factors of 4, 3, 3, 6, and 5 for $\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\Omega_{\rm b}$,
$h$, $n_s$, and $\sigma_8$, respectively. We compare DS statistics when the
local density environment is estimated from the real or redshift-space
positions of haloes. The inclusion of DS autocorrelation functions, in addition
to the cross-correlation functions between DS environments and haloes, recovers
most of the information that is lost when using the redshift-space halo
positions to estimate the environment. We discuss the possibility of
constructing simulation-based methods to model DS clustering statistics in
different scenarios.

describing, e.g., high-$T_c$ superconducting cuprates, we study high-harmonic
generation (HHG) from doped, correlated materials. Doping is modeled by
changing the number of electrons in the lattice from the conventional
half-filling case. For relatively small Hubbard $U$, i.e., small
electron-electron correlation, we find little to no effect of doping on the
dynamics and the HHG spectra. For increasing $U$ the degree of doping has a
marked effect on the dynamics and spectra. We explain these findings through
the quasiparticle-based doublon-holon picture. The dynamics are separated into
two types, firstly doublon and holon movement, and, secondly, doublon-holon
pair creation and annihilation. Doping results in all configurations containing
doublons or holons. Those quasiparticles can move at no extra cost in energy
regardless of the correlation level. This motion at no energy cost increases
the high-harmonic gain for low and medium harmonic orders. We discuss that in
the high-$U$ limit, antiferromagnetic ordering becomes increasingly unlikely
with increasing doping rates and explain an associated drop in the high-order
harmonics relative to the case of half filling.

and common benchmark suites on data center nodes and measuring the energy
consumption. Three main aspects are analysed: directive-generated loop tiling
and unrolling, parallel for loops and explicit tasking, and the policy of
handling blocked threads. For loop tiling and unrolling, we find that tiling
can yield significant energy savings for some, mostly unoptimised programs,
while directive-generated unrolling provides very minor improvement in the best

aspect, we find that parallel for loops yield better results than explicit
tasking loops in cases where both can be used. This becomes more prominent with
more fine-grained workloads. For the third, we find that significant energy
savings can be made by not descheduling waiting threads, but instead having
them spin, at the cost of a higher power consumption. We also analyse how the
choice of compiler affects the above questions by compiling programs with each

high-quality components using powder bed additive manufacturing (AM).
Blade-like tools are often employed for spreading powder metal feedstocks,
especially in laser powder bed fusion and electron beam melting, where powders
are characterized by a D50 of 30 microns or greater. Along with variations in
boundary conditions introduced by the layer-wise geometry and surface
topography of the printed component, stochastic interactions between the
spreading tool and powder result in spatial variations of layer quality that
are still not well understood. Here, to study powder spreading under conditions
representative of powder bed AM, we employ a modular, mechanized apparatus to
create powder layers from moderately and highly cohesive powders with a
selection of blade-like spreading tools. Powder layer effective depth is
spatially mapped using transmission X-ray imaging, and uniformity is quantified
via a statistical approach. We first compare layer density, or the effective
depth of powder layer, and show that blade geometries with a curved profile
lead to increased material deposition. Second, this approach enables
quantification of local fluctuations, or layer defect severity. For example, we
observe that the primary benefit of a V-shaped rubber blade, as compared to a
45 degree rigid blade, lies in enabling local deflection of the blade edge to
eliminate streaking from large particles, while also increasing deposition.
Additionally, we employ a custom DEM simulation to elucidate the opposing roles
of particle density and surface energy with a pseudo-material approach, where
the balance of inertial and cohesive forces determine macro-scale powder
flowability. For specific alloy densities, we find a critical surface energy
beyond which layer density is greatly impaired when powder spreading is
performed using a blade.

so, we use a class of linear weighting estimators that re-weight white patients

This framework nests many common approaches, including matching and linear
regression, but offers important advantages over these methods in terms of
controlling imbalance between groups, minimizing extrapolation, and reducing

been visited by Voyager 2 in 1989. Over the last few years, the demand for a
new mission to the Ice Giants and their systems has increased so that a
theoretical basis to prepare for such a mission is important.
  We aim to develop a photochemical model of Triton's atmosphere with an
up-to-date chemical scheme, as previous photochemical models date back to the
post-flyby years. This is done to better understand the mechanisms governing
Triton's atmospheric chemistry and highlight the critical parameters having a
significant impact on the atmospheric composition. We also study model
uncertainties to find what chemical studies are necessary to improve the
modeling of Triton's atmosphere.
  We adapted a model of Titan's atmosphere to Triton's conditions. We first
used Titan's chemical scheme before updating it to better model Triton's
atmosphere. Once the nominal results were obtained, we studied model
uncertainties with a Monte-Carlo procedure. Then, we performed global
sensitivity analyzes to identify the reactions responsible for model
uncertainties.
  With the nominal results, we determined the composition of Triton's
atmosphere and studied the main chemical processes. We highlighted key chemical
reactions that are the most important for the overall chemistry. We also
identified some key parameters having a significant impact on the results.
Uncertainties are large for most of the main atmospheric species as the
atmospheric temperature is very low. We identified key uncertainty reactions
that have the largest impact on the results uncertainties. These reactions must
be studied in priority in order to improve the significance of our results.

one state to another at tipping points, resulting in a growing threat to our
society. Yet, it is not fully clear how to assess and quantify the influence of
a tipping element and how to explore the teleconnections between different
tipping elements. To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a climate network
approach to quantitatively analyze the global impacts of a prominent tipping
element, the Amazon Rainforest Area (ARA). We find that regions, such as, the
Tibetan Plateau (TP) and West Antarctic ice sheet, are characterized by higher
network weighted links and exhibit strong correlations with the ARA. We then
identify a teleconnection propagation path between the ARA and the TP. This
path is robust under climate change as simulated by various climate models of
CMIP5 and CMIP6. In addition, we detect early warning signals for critical
transition in the snow cover extent on the Tibetan Plateau by applying critical
slowing down indicators, lag-1 autocorrelation and detrended fluctuation
analysis. We find that the snow cover of the TP has been losing stability since
2008, revealing that the TP is operating like a tipping element and approaching
a potential tipping point. We further uncover that various climate extremes
between the ARA and the TP are significantly synchronized under climate change.
Our framework provides new insights into how tipping elements are linked to
each other and into the potential predictability of cascading tipping dynamics.

energy markets, and may adopt flexible operation to boost profitability. To aid
in the transition from baseload to flexible operation paradigm, autonomous
operation is sought. This work focuses on the control aspect of autonomous
operation. Specifically, a hierarchical control system is designed to support
constraint enforcement during routine operational transients. Within the
system, data-driven modeling, physics-based state observation, and classical
control algorithms are integrated to provide an adaptable and robust solution.
A 320 MW Fluoride-cooled High-temperature Pebble-bed Reactor is the design
basis for demonstrating the control system.
  The hierarchical control system consists of a supervisory layer and low-level
layer. The supervisory layer receives requests to change the system's operating
conditions, and accepts or rejects them based on constraints that have been
assigned. Constraints are issued to keep the plant within an optimal operating
region. The low-level layer interfaces with the actuators of the system to
fulfill requested changes, while maintaining tracking and regulation duties. To
accept requests at the supervisory layer, the Reference Governor algorithm was
adopted. To model the dynamics of the reactor, a system identification
algorithm, Dynamic Mode Decomposition, was utilized. To estimate the evolution
of process variables that cannot be directly measured, the Unscented Kalman
Filter, incorporating a nonlinear model of nuclear dynamics, was adopted. The
composition of these algorithms led to a numerical demonstration of constraint
enforcement during a 40 % power drop transient. Adaptability was demonstrated
by modifying the constraint values, and enforcing them during the transient.
Robustness was demonstrated by enforcing constraints under noisy environments.

because of its analogy with the many-body localization (MBL) transition. Unlike
the latter, many results for random graphs are now well established, in
particular the existence and precise value of a critical disorder separating a
localized from an ergodic delocalized phase. However, the renormalization group
flow and the nature of the transition are not well understood. In turn, recent
works on the MBL transition have made the remarkable prediction that the flow
is of Kosterlitz-Thouless type. Here we show that the Anderson transition on
graphs displays the same type of flow. Our work attests to the importance of
rare branches along which wave functions have a much larger localization length
$\xi_\parallel$ than the one in the transverse direction, $\xi_\perp$.
Importantly, these two lengths have different critical behaviors:
$\xi_\parallel$ diverges with a critical exponent $\nu_\parallel=1$, while
$\xi_\perp$ reaches a finite universal value ${\xi_\perp^c}$ at the transition
point $W_c$. Indeed, $\xi_\perp^{-1} \approx {\xi_\perp^c}^{-1} + \xi^{-1}$,
with $\xi \sim (W-W_c)^{-\nu_\perp}$ associated with a new critical exponent
$\nu_\perp = 1/2$, where $\exp( \xi)$ controls finite-size effects. The
delocalized phase inherits the strongly non-ergodic properties of the critical
regime at short scales, but is ergodic at large scales, with a unique critical
exponent $\nu=1/2$. This shows a very strong analogy with the MBL transition:
the behavior of $\xi_\perp$ is identical to that recently predicted for the
typical localization length of MBL in a phenomenological renormalization group
flow. We demonstrate these important properties for a smallworld complex
network model and show the universality of our results by considering different
network parameters and different key observables of Anderson localization.

active solid is made of nonlinear hard springs, the solid's average deformation

reversible jamming transition of granular materials to hold and manipulate
objects. Their holding force comes from the combination of three mechanisms:
frictional forces, geometrical constraints, and suction effects. In this work,
we experimentally study the effect of particle size on the suction mechanism.
Through X-ray computed tomography, we show that small particles (average
diameter d = 120 micrometers) achieve higher conformation around the object
than larger particles (d = 4mm), thus allowing the formation of air-tight
seals. When the gripper is pulled off, mimicking lifting of an object, vacuum
pressure is generated in the sealed cavity at the interface gripper--object. If
the particles used as filling material are too large, the gripper does not
conform closely around the object, leaving gaps between the gripper's membrane
and the object. These gaps prevent the formation of sealed vacuum cavities
between the object and the gripper and in turn hinder the suction mechanism
from operating.

no constraints on the energy injection and dissipation scales can be obtained
from the current data, we show that robust constraints on the power-law slope
of the VSFs can be determined after accounting for the effects of atmospheric
seeing, spatial smoothing, and large-scale bulk flows. Out of the four QSO
nebulae studied, one exhibits VSFs in spectacular agreement with the Kolmogorov
law, expected for isotropic, homogeneous, and incompressible turbulent flows.
The other three fields exhibit a shallower decline in the VSFs from large to
small scales. However, with a limited dynamic range in the spatial scales in
seeing-limited data, no constraints can be obtained for the VSF slopes of these
three nebulae. For the QSO nebula consistent with the Kolmogorov law, we
determine a turbulence energy cascade rate of $\approx\!0.2$ cm$^{2}$ s$^{-3}$.

paper we study integral Ricci curvature bounds based on worldvolume quantum
strong energy inequalities. Under the additional assumption of a - potentially
very negative - global timelike Ricci curvature bound, a Hawking type
singularity theorem is proven. Finally, we apply the theorem to a cosmological

introduces a novel dataset for multimodal intent recognition (MIntRec) to
address this issue. It formulates coarse-grained and fine-grained intent
taxonomies based on the data collected from the TV series Superstore. The
dataset consists of 2,224 high-quality samples with text, video, and audio
modalities and has multimodal annotations among twenty intent categories.
Furthermore, we provide annotated bounding boxes of speakers in each video
segment and achieve an automatic process for speaker annotation. MIntRec is
helpful for researchers to mine relationships between different modalities to
enhance the capability of intent recognition. We extract features from each
modality and model cross-modal interactions by adapting three powerful
multimodal fusion methods to build baselines. Extensive experiments show that
employing the non-verbal modalities achieves substantial improvements compared
with the text-only modality, demonstrating the effectiveness of using
multimodal information for intent recognition. The gap between the
best-performing methods and humans indicates the challenge and importance of
this task for the community. The full dataset and codes are available for use

semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach to improve the labeling consistency of
the COUGHVID dataset and the robustness of COVID-19 versus healthy cough sound
classification. First, we leverage existing SSL expert knowledge aggregation
techniques to overcome the labeling inconsistencies and sparsity in the
dataset. Next, our SSL approach is used to identify a subsample of re-labeled
COUGHVID audio samples that can be used to train or augment future cough
classification models. The consistency of the re-labeled data is demonstrated
in that it exhibits a high degree of class separability, 3x higher than that of
the user-labeled data, despite the expert label inconsistency present in the
original dataset. Furthermore, the spectral differences in the user-labeled
audio segments are amplified in the re-labeled data, resulting in significantly
different power spectral densities between healthy and COVID-19 coughs, which
demonstrates both the increased consistency of the new dataset and its
explainability from an acoustic perspective. Finally, we demonstrate how the
re-labeled dataset can be used to train a cough classifier. This SSL approach
can be used to combine the medical knowledge of several experts to improve the
database consistency for any diagnostic classification task.

'neurons' are a very loose approximation of biological neurons. Today's
learning approaches are designed to function on digital devices with digital
data representations such as image frames. In contrast, biological vision
systems are generally much more capable and efficient than state-of-the-art
digital computer vision algorithms. Event cameras are an emerging sensor
technology which imitates biological vision with asynchronously firing pixels,
eschewing the concept of the image frame. To leverage modern learning
techniques, many event-based algorithms are forced to accumulate events back to
image frames, somewhat squandering the advantages of event cameras.
  We follow the opposite paradigm and develop a new type of neural network
which operates closer to the original event data stream. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance in angular velocity regression and competitive
optical flow estimation, while avoiding difficulties related to training SNN.
Furthermore, the processing latency of our proposed approach is less than 1/10

  generalized linear mixed models with covariate adjustment: a simulation study",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) are a popular tool to analyze
clustered data, but when the number of clusters is small to moderate, standard
statistical tests may produce elevated type I error rates. Small-sample
corrections have been proposed to address this issue for continuous or binary
outcomes without covariate adjustment. However, appropriate tests to use for
count outcomes or under covariate-adjusted models remains unknown. An important
setting in which this issue arises is in cluster-randomized trials (CRTs).
Because many CRTs have just a few clusters (e.g., clinics or health systems),
covariate adjustment is particularly critical to address potential chance
imbalance and/or low power (e.g., adjustment following stratified randomization
or for the baseline value of the outcome). We conducted simulations to evaluate
GLMM-based tests of the treatment effect that account for the small (10) or
moderate (20) number of clusters under a parallel-group CRT setting across
scenarios of covariate adjustment (including adjustment for one or more
person-level or cluster-level covariates) for both binary and count outcomes.
We find that when the intraclass correlation is non-negligible ($\geq 0.01$)
and the number of covariates is small ($\leq 2$), likelihood ratio tests with a
between-within denominator degree of freedom have type I error rates close to
the nominal level. When the number of covariates is moderate ($\geq 5$), across
our simulation scenarios, the relative performance of the tests varied
considerably and no method performed uniformly well. Therefore, we recommend
adjusting for no more than a few covariates and using likelihood ratio tests
with a between-within denominator degree of freedom.

and derive the equations of motion of FB electrons subjected to slowly varying
external fields (not to be confused with the fast-changing Floquet drive),
revealing behaviors similar to ordinary Bloch electrons but with quantities
modified in the Floquet context. Specifically, we study local magnetic moment
due to the self-rotation of the wave-packet, a contribution to total

fully occupied FB band. Based on the semiclassical theory, we can also show the
fingerprint of the energy flow in such an energy-non-conserved system. We then
discuss the density matrix of a FB system attached to a thermal bath, which
allows us to investigate quantities involving many electrons in the
non-interacting limit. As an application, we calculate the intrinsic current
response in an oblique spacetime metal showing the non-equilibrium nature of

engineering to describe simulation of physical processes as scalar and vector
fields interacting and coevolving over time. Due to the computationally
expensive nature of their standard solution methods, neural PDE surrogates have
become an active research topic to accelerate these simulations. However,
current methods do not explicitly take into account the relationship between
different fields and their internal components, which are often correlated.
Viewing the time evolution of such correlated fields through the lens of
multivector fields allows us to overcome these limitations. Multivector fields
consist of scalar, vector, as well as higher-order components, such as
bivectors and trivectors. Their algebraic properties, such as multiplication,
addition and other arithmetic operations can be described by Clifford algebras.
To our knowledge, this paper presents the first usage of such multivector
representations together with Clifford convolutions and Clifford Fourier
transforms in the context of deep learning. The resulting Clifford neural
layers are universally applicable and will find direct use in the areas of
fluid dynamics, weather forecasting, and the modeling of physical systems in
general. We empirically evaluate the benefit of Clifford neural layers by
replacing convolution and Fourier operations in common neural PDE surrogates by
their Clifford counterparts on 2D Navier-Stokes and weather modeling tasks, as
well as 3D Maxwell equations. For similar parameter count, Clifford neural
layers consistently improve generalization capabilities of the tested neural
PDE surrogates. Source code for our PyTorch implementation is available at

(i.e., catastrophic forgetting) is a computational challenge for both
artificial and biological neural networks, yet artificial systems struggle to
achieve parity with their biological analogues. Mammalian brains employ
numerous neural operations in support of continual learning during sleep. These
are ripe for artificial adaptation. Here, we investigate how modeling three
distinct components of mammalian sleep together affects continual learning in
artificial neural networks: (1) a veridical memory replay process observed
during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep; (2) a generative memory replay
process linked to REM sleep; and (3) a synaptic downscaling process which has
been proposed to tune signal-to-noise ratios and support neural upkeep. We find
benefits from the inclusion of all three sleep components when evaluating
performance on a continual learning CIFAR-100 image classification benchmark.
Maximum accuracy improved during training and catastrophic forgetting was
reduced during later tasks. While some catastrophic forgetting persisted over
the course of network training, higher levels of synaptic downscaling lead to
better retention of early tasks and further facilitated the recovery of early
task accuracy during subsequent training. One key takeaway is that there is a
trade-off at hand when considering the level of synaptic downscaling to use -
more aggressive downscaling better protects early tasks, but less downscaling
enhances the ability to learn new tasks. Intermediate levels can strike a
balance with the highest overall accuracies during training. Overall, our
results both provide insight into how to adapt sleep components to enhance
artificial continual learning systems and highlight areas for future
neuroscientific sleep research to further such systems.

a simple task and most existing methods choose the adaptive weights based on
approximating the full distribution or the maximum of residuals. In this paper,
we show that the bottleneck in the adaptive choice of samples for training
efficiency is the behavior of the tail distribution of the numerical residual.
Thus, we propose the Residual-Quantile Adjustment (RQA) method for a better
weight choice for each training sample. After initially setting the weights
proportional to the $p$-th power of the residual, our RQA method reassign all
weights above $q$-quantile ($90\%$ for example) to the median value, so that
the weight follows a quantile-adjusted distribution derived from the residuals.
This iterative reweighting technique, on the other hand, is also very easy to
implement. Experiment results show that the proposed method can outperform
several adaptive methods on various partial differential equation (PDE)

  Experimentation",,,,,"cs.LG cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In online experimentation, appropriate metrics (e.g., purchase) provide
strong evidence to support hypotheses and enhance the decision-making process.
However, incomplete metrics are frequently occurred in the online
experimentation, making the available data to be much fewer than the planned
online experiments (e.g., A/B testing). In this work, we introduce the concept
of dropout buyers and categorize users with incomplete metric values into two
groups: visitors and dropout buyers. For the analysis of incomplete metrics, we
propose a clustering-based imputation method using $k$-nearest neighbors. Our
proposed imputation method considers both the experiment-specific features and
users' activities along their shopping paths, allowing different imputation
values for different users. To facilitate efficient imputation of large-scale
data sets in online experimentation, the proposed method uses a combination of
stratification and clustering. The performance of the proposed method is
compared to several conventional methods in both simulation studies and a real
online experiment at eBay.

increasing interest in recommender system fairness in general, the music domain
has received relatively little attention in this regard. However, addressing
fairness of music recommender systems (MRSs) is highly important because the
performance of these systems considerably impacts both the users of music
streaming platforms and the artists providing music to those platforms. The
distinct needs that these stakeholder groups may have, and the different
aspects of fairness that therefore should be considered, make for a challenging
research field with ample opportunities for improvement. The review first
outlines current literature on MRS fairness from the perspective of each
stakeholder and the stakeholders combined, and then identifies promising
directions for future research.
  The two open questions arising from the review are as follows: (i) In the MRS
field, only limited data is publicly available to conduct fairness research;
most datasets either originate from the same source or are proprietary (and,
thus, not widely accessible). How can we address this limited data
availability? (ii) Overall, the review shows that the large majority of works
analyze the current situation of MRS fairness, whereas only few works propose
approaches to improve it. How can we move forward to a focus on improving
fairness aspects in these recommender systems?
  At FAccTRec '22, we emphasize the specifics of addressing RS fairness in the
music domain.

fibrillation. However, currently there is no direct way to measure action
potential wave patterns transmurally throughout the thick ventricular heart
muscle. Consequently, direct observations of three-dimensional electrical
scroll waves remains elusive. Here, we study whether it is possible to
reconstruct simulated scroll waves and scroll wave chaos using deep learning.
We trained encoding-decoding convolutional neural networks to predict
three-dimensional scroll wave dynamics inside bulk-shaped excitable media from
two-dimensional observations of the wave dynamics on the bulk's surface. We
tested whether observations from one or two opposing surfaces would be
sufficient, and whether transparency or measurements of surface deformations
enhances the reconstruction. Further, we evaluated the approach's robustness
against noise and tested the feasibility of predicting the bulk's thickness. We
distinguished isotropic and anisotropic, as well as opaque and transparent
excitable media as models for cardiac tissue and the Belousov-Zhabotinsky
chemical reaction, respectively. While we demonstrate that it is possible to
reconstruct three-dimensional scroll wave dynamics, we also show that it is
challenging to reconstruct complicated scroll wave chaos and that prediction
outcomes depend on various factors such as transparency, anisotropy and
ultimately the thickness of the medium compared to the size of the scroll
waves. In particular, we found that anisotropy provides crucial information for
neural networks to decode depth, which facilitates the reconstructions. In the
future, deep neural networks could be used to visualize intramural action
potential wave patterns from epi- or endocardial measurements.

dual hemispheres could interact in a given task. We propose a bilateral
artificial neural network that imitates a lateralization observed in nature:
that the left hemisphere specializes in specificity and the right in
generalities. We used two ResNet-9 convolutional neural networks with different

found that the hemispheres represent complementary features that are exploited
by a network head which implements a type of weighted attention. The bilateral

demonstrate the efficacy of bilateralism, contribute to an understanding of

conducted on the use of blockchain in supply chains is still in the early
stages. In this paper, the use of blockchain technology to monitor the vaccine
supply and distribution system will be investigated. A model close to reality
of today's vaccine supply chains in developing countries is considered and then
a new intelligent system for vaccine monitoring in the vaccine supply chain is
designed based on the considered model. Also, smart contracts based on a
blockchain network is designed to check consumer vaccination records as well as
vaccine circulation from beginning to end. The implementation and design of the
vaccine supply chain is done using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain
network. Additionally, the system has been tested on both local networks, the
