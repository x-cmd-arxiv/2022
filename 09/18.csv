Then, we conduct experiments using strong baselines for disfluency detection

flares which are explained as being a result of a secondary supermassive black
hole (SMBH) impacting the accretion disk of a primary SMBH in a binary system.
We begin by showing that these flares occur at times predicted by a simple
analytical formula, based on the Kepler equation, which explains flares since
1888. The next impact flare, namely the flare number 26, is rather peculiar as
it breaks the typical pattern of two impact flares per 12 year cycle. This will
be the third bremsstrahlung flare of the current cycle that follows the already
observed 2015 and 2019 impact flares from OJ~287. Unfortunately, astrophysical
considerations make it difficult to predict the exact arrival epoch of the
flare number 26. In the second part of the paper, we describe our recent OJ~287
observations. They show that the pre-flare light curve of flare number 22,
observed in 2005, exhibits similar activity as the pre-flare light curve in
2022, preceding the expected flare number 26 in our model. We argue that the
pre-flare activity most likely arises in the primary jet whose activity is
modulated by the transit of the secondary SMBH through the accretion disk of
the primary. Observing the next impact flare of OJ~287 in October 2022 will
substantiate the theory of disk impacts in binary black hole systems.

semantic aspects of code. Even though extractive question-answering using
neural approaches has been studied widely in natural languages, the problem of
answering semantic queries over code using neural networks has not yet been
explored. This is mainly because there is no existing dataset with extractive
question and answer pairs over code involving complex concepts and long chains
of reasoning. We bridge this gap by building a new, curated dataset called
CodeQueries, and proposing a neural question-answering methodology over code.
  We build upon state-of-the-art pre-trained models of code to predict answer
and supporting-fact spans. Given a query and code, only some of the code may be
relevant to answer the query. We first experiment under an ideal setting where
only the relevant code is given to the model and show that our models do well.
We then experiment under three pragmatic considerations: (1) scaling to
large-size code, (2) learning from a limited number of examples and (3)
robustness to minor syntax errors in code. Our results show that while a neural
model can be resilient to minor syntax errors in code, increasing size of code,
presence of code that is not relevant to the query, and reduced number of
training examples limit the model performance. We are releasing our data and
models to facilitate future work on the proposed problem of answering semantic

ship landing of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capable unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs), using only a monocular camera in the UAV for tracking and
localization. Ship landing is a challenging task due to the small landing
space, six degrees of freedom ship deck motion, limited visual references for
localization, and adversarial environmental conditions such as wind gusts. We
first develop a computer vision algorithm which estimates the relative position
of the UAV with respect to a horizon reference bar on the landing platform
using the image stream from a monocular vision camera on the UAV. Our approach
is motivated by the actual ship landing procedure followed by the Navy
helicopter pilots in tracking the horizon reference bar as a visual cue. We
then develop a robust reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for controlling the
UAV towards the landing platform even in the presence of adversarial
environmental conditions such as wind gusts. We demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithm compared to a benchmark nonlinear PID control
approach, both in the simulation experiments using the Gazebo environment and
in the real-world setting using a Parrot ANAFI quad-rotor and sub-scale ship
platform undergoing 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) deck motion.

combine trade data with data on patent applications and research publications

industrial programming languages, it is a surprisingly involved task. There are
known approaches to generate parsers automatically, but the prevailing
consensus is that automatic parser generation is not practical for real
programming languages: LR/LALR parsers are considered to be far too restrictive
in the grammars they support, and LR parsers are often considered too
inefficient in practice. As a result, virtually all modern languages use
recursive-descent parsers written by hand, a lengthy and error-prone process
that dramatically increases the barrier to new programming language
development.
  In this work we demonstrate that, contrary to the prevailing consensus, we
can have the best of both worlds: for a very general, practical class of
grammars -- a strict superset of Knuth's canonical LR -- we can generate
parsers automatically, and the resulting parser code, as well as the generation
procedure itself, is highly efficient. This advance relies on several new
ideas, including novel automata optimization procedures; a new grammar
transformation (""CPS""); per-symbol attributes; recursive-descent actions; and
an extension of canonical LR parsing, which we refer to as XLR, which endows
shift/reduce parsers with the power of bounded nondeterministic choice.
  With these ingredients, we can automatically generate efficient parsers for
virtually all programming languages that are intuitively easy to parse -- a
claim we support experimentally, by implementing the new algorithms in a new
software tool called langcc, and running them on syntax specifications for
Golang 1.17.8 and Python 3.9.12. The tool handles both languages automatically,
and the generated code, when run on standard codebases, is 1.2x faster than the
corresponding hand-written parser for Golang, and 4.3x faster than the CPython
parser, respectively.

$(n\!+\!1)\text{th}$ energy eigenstate (Fock state). This reflects a remarkable
link between the energy at the input of the channel and a disorder relation at
its output as captured by majorization theory. This result was previously known
in the special cases of a pure-loss channel and quantum-limited amplifier, and
we achieve here its nontrivial generalization to any single-mode
phase-covariant (or -contravariant) bosonic Gaussian channel. The key to our
proof is the explicit construction of a column-stochastic matrix that relates
the outputs of the channel for any two subsequent Fock states at its input.
This is made possible by exploiting a recently found recurrence relation on
multiphoton transition probabilities for Gaussian unitaries [M. G. Jabbour and

opening the possibility that the model can be entirely excluded if experiments
reveal no deviations from the Standard Model. We explore this model, focusing
on the part of parameter space in which the vacuum expectation value of the
triplets, $\nu_\chi$, is small. In the small-$\nu_\chi$ limit, the second
custodial-singlet scalar field $S$ necessarily becomes very light and can
contribute to the total width of the 125 GeV Higgs boson $h$ via $h \to SS$. We
show that this process, together with LHC measurements of the $h \to

constrains the parameter space, setting an experimental lower bound $\nu_\chi
\gtrsim 12.5$ GeV on the vacuum expectation value of the triplets. This lower
bound makes it impossible to avoid deviations from the Standard Model in the
couplings of $h$ to fermion and vector boson pairs. We study the remaining
parameter space after imposing constraints from direct searches for the
additional Higgs bosons, and show that it is on the edge of being fully
excluded at $95\%$ confidence level by LHC measurements of the 125 GeV Higgs
boson's couplings. Measurements of these couplings at the future

digital ad-campaigns at online publishers. The algorithm enables the advertiser
to search across available target audiences and ad-media to find the best
possible combination for its campaign via online experimentation. The problem
of finding the best audience-ad combination is complicated by a number of
distinctive challenges, including (a) a need for active exploration to resolve
prior uncertainty and to speed the search for profitable combinations, (b) many
combinations to choose from, giving rise to high-dimensional search
formulations, and (c) very low success probabilities, typically just a fraction
of one percent. Our algorithm (designated LRDL, an acronym for Logistic
Regression with Debiased Lasso) addresses these challenges by combining four
elements: a multiarmed bandit framework for active exploration; a Lasso penalty
function to handle high dimensionality; an inbuilt debiasing kernel that
handles the regularization bias induced by the Lasso; and a semi-parametric
regression model for outcomes that promotes cross-learning across arms. The
algorithm is implemented as a Thompson Sampler, and to the best of our
knowledge, it is the first that can practically address all of the challenges
above. Simulations with real and synthetic data show the method is effective
and document its superior performance against several benchmarks from the
recent high-dimensional bandit literature.

gravitational waves are necessarily present. On the other hand, gravitational
waves can collapse to a black hole even without matter. One might therefore
wonder how the interaction and competition between the matter fields and
gravitational waves affects critical phenomena at the threshold of black hole
formation. As a toy model for this, we study the threshold of black-hole
formation in 4+1 dimensions, where we add a massless minimally coupled scalar
matter field to the gravitational wave ansatz of Biz\'on, Chmaj and Schmidt (in
a nutshell, Bianchi~IX on $S^3\times\text{radius}\times\text{time}$). In order
to find a stable discretisation of the equation governing the gravitational
waves in 4+1 physical dimensions, which has the same principal part as the
spherical wave equation in 9+1 dimensions, we first revisit the problem of
critical spherical scalar field collapse in $n+2$ dimensions with large $n$.
Returning to the main problem, we find numerically that weak gravitational wave
perturbations of the scalar field critical solution decay, while weak scalar
perturbations of the gravitational wave critical solution also decay. A
dynamical systems picture then suggests the existence of a codimension-two
attractor. We find numerical evidence for this attractor by evolving mixed
initial data and fine-tuning both an overall amplitude and the relative
strength of the two fields.

prevents vehicles from accessing tight spaces and places the cognitive load for

hierarchical collision checking. The hierarchical collision checker
simultaneously adapts the local map's voxel size and maximum vehicle speed to
ensure motion planning safety. The proposed methodology is evaluated in

required to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment such that treatments deemed
safe and effective can be made publicly available, there has been substantial
recent interest in using an earlier or easier to measure surrogate marker, $S$,
in place of the primary outcome, $Y$. To validate the utility of a surrogate
marker in these settings, a commonly advocated measure is the proportion of
treatment effect on the primary outcome that is explained by the treatment
effect on the surrogate marker (PTE). Model based and model free estimators for
PTE have also been developed. While this measure is very intuitive, it does not
directly address the important questions of how $S$ can be used to make
inference of the unavailable $Y$ in the next phase clinical trials. In this
paper, to optimally use the information of surrogate S, we provide a framework
for deriving an optimal transformation of $S$, $g_{opt}(S)$, such that the
treatment effect on $g_{opt}(S)$ maximally approximates the treatment effect on
$Y$ in a certain sense. Based on the optimally transformed surrogate,
$g_{opt}(S)$, we propose a new measure to quantify surrogacy, the relative
power (RP), and demonstrate how RP can be used to make decisions with $S$
instead of $Y$ for next phase trials. We propose nonparametric estimation
procedures, derive asymptotic properties, and compare the RP measure with the
PTE measure. Finite sample performance of our estimators is assessed via a
simulation study. We illustrate our proposed procedures using an application to

hysteresis of a sphincter during a contraction cycle, which is available
through FLIP testing, offers information on its functionality, and can provide
diagnostic insights. However, limited work has been done to explain the
mechanics of these pressure-CSA loops. This work presents a consolidated
picture of pressure-CSA loops of different sphincters. Clinical data reveal
that although sphincters have a similar purpose (controlling the flow of
liquids and solids by opening and closing), two different pressure-CSA loop
patterns emerge: negative slope loop (NSL) and positive slope loop (PSL). We
show that the loop type is the result of an interplay between (or lack thereof)
two mechanical modes: (i) neurogenic mediated relaxation of the sphincter
muscle and (ii) muscle contraction proximal to the sphincter which causes
mechanical distention. We conclude that sphincters which only function through
mechanism (i) exhibition NSL whereas sphincters which open as a result of both
(i) and (ii) display a PSL. This work provides a fundamental mechanical
understanding of human sphincters. This can be used to identify normal and
abnormal phenotypes for the different sphincters and help in creating

  Resected Lung Tumors with Adaptive Convolutional Neural Networks","9 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality by a significant
margin. While new technologies, such as image segmentation, have been paramount
to improved detection and earlier diagnoses, there are still significant
challenges in treating the disease. In particular, despite an increased number
of curative resections, many postoperative patients still develop recurrent
lesions. Consequently, there is a significant need for prognostic tools that
can more accurately predict a patient's risk for recurrence.
  In this paper, we explore the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for
the segmentation and recurrence risk prediction of lung tumors that are present
in preoperative computed tomography (CT) images. First, expanding upon recent
progress in medical image segmentation, a residual U-Net is used to localize
and characterize each nodule. Then, the identified tumors are passed to a
second CNN for recurrence risk prediction. The system's final results are
produced with a random forest classifier that synthesizes the predictions of
the second network with clinical attributes. The segmentation stage uses the
LIDC-IDRI dataset and achieves a dice score of 70.3%. The recurrence risk stage
uses the NLST dataset from the National Cancer institute and achieves an AUC of
73.0%. Our proposed framework demonstrates that first, automated nodule
segmentation methods can generalize to enable pipelines for a wide range of
multitask systems and second, that deep learning and image processing have the
potential to improve current prognostic tools. To the best of our knowledge, it
is the first fully automated segmentation and recurrence risk prediction
system.

  on Riemannian Manifolds",,,,,"math.ST math.PR stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Stein's method has been widely used to achieve distributional approximations
for probability distributions defined in Euclidean spaces. Recently, techniques
to extend Stein's method to manifold-valued random variables with distributions
defined on the respective manifolds have been reported. However, several of
these methods impose strong regularity conditions on the distributions as well
as the manifolds and/or consider very special cases. In this paper, we present
a novel framework for Stein's method on Riemannian manifolds using the
Friedrichs extension technique applied to self-adjoint unbounded operators.
This framework is applicable to a variety of conventional and unconventional
situations, including but not limited to, intrinsically defined non-smooth
distributions, truncated distributions on Riemannian manifolds, distributions
on incomplete Riemannian manifolds, etc. Moreover, the stronger the regularity
conditions imposed on the manifolds or target distributions, the stronger will
be the characterization ability of our novel Stein pair, which facilitates the
application of Stein's method to problem domains hitherto uncharted. We present
several (non-numeric) examples illustrating the applicability of the presented
theory.

visualize the post-hoc explanations from both stages to provide a visual
grounding to introspection. For the application of recognition, we show that an
introspective network is 4% more robust and 42% less prone to calibration
errors when generalizing to noisy data. We also illustrate the value of
introspective networks in downstream tasks that require generalizability and
calibration including active learning, out-of-distribution detection, and
uncertainty estimation. Finally, we ground the proposed machine introspection
to human introspection for the application of image quality assessment.

adjusts constraint violation penalty terms adaptively through a meta objective

bears a term that is thought of as carrying part of the information on the mass

only marginal feature or label distribution shifts are considered. We describe

spherically symmetric regular black hole, which is a solution of Einstein field
equations coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics. In fact, the regular black
hole is a Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole when a metric function is given a
Taylor expansion to first order approximations. It does not have a curvature
singularity at the origin,but the RN black hole does. Both black hole metrics
have horizons and similar asymptotic behaviors, and satisfy the weak energy
conditions everywhere. They are almost the same in photon effective potentials,
photon circular orbits and photon spheres outside the event horizons. There are
relatively minor differences between effective potentials, stable circular
orbits and innermost stable circular orbits of charged particles outside the
event horizons of the two black holes immersed in external magnetic fields.
Although the twomagnetized black holes allow different construction methods of
explicit symplectic integrators, they exhibit approximately consistent results
in the regular and chaotic dynamics of charged particles outside the event
horizons. Chaos gets strong as the magnetic field parameter or the magnitude of
negative Coulomb parameter increases, but becomes weak when the black hole
charge or the positive Coulomb parameter increases. A variation of dynamical
properties is not sensitive dependence on an appropriate increase of the black
hole charge. The basic equivalence between the two black hole gravitational
systems in the dynamics of orbits outside the event horizons is due to the two
metric functions having an extremely small difference. This implies that the RN
black hole is reasonably replaced by the regular black hole without curvature
singularity in many situations.

High-fidelity numerical results are computed from an in-house discontinuous

physiological. We perform this study using a Newtonian blood-analog fluid
subjected to a pulsatile flow with two inflow conditions. The first flow
condition is fully developed while the second condition is undeveloped (i.e.
uniform). We observe and discuss differences in secondary flow patterns that
emerge over the rapid acceleration and deceleration phases of the physiological
waveform, and we directly connect the variation in intensity of these secondary
flow patterns along the curvature to differences in the wall shear stress
metrics for each entrance condition. Results indicate that decreased axial
velocities under an undeveloped condition produce less intense secondary flow
that, in turn, reduces both the oscillatory and multidirectional nature of the
wall shear stress vector, and we link this effect to abnormalities in computed
stress metrics. These results suggest potentially lower prevalence of disease
in curvatures where entrance flow is rather undeveloped-a physiologically

2022. Each instance consists of a query input for an API (e.g., an image or
text) along with the API's output prediction/annotation and confidence scores.
HAPI is the first large-scale dataset of ML API usages and is a unique resource
for studying ML-as-a-service (MLaaS). As examples of the types of analyses that
HAPI enables, we show that ML APIs' performance change substantially over
time--several APIs' accuracies dropped on specific benchmark datasets. Even
when the API's aggregate performance stays steady, its error modes can shift
across different subtypes of data between 2020 and 2022. Such changes can
substantially impact the entire analytics pipelines that use some ML API as a

disparities across demographic subgroups over time. HAPI can stimulate more

the interfacial charge transfer and weak chemical interactions between chromium

  Item-Centric Perspectives","25 pages",,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  With the outbreak of today's streaming data, the sequential recommendation is
a promising solution to achieve time-aware personalized modeling. It aims to
infer the next interacted item of a given user based on the history item
sequence. Some recent works tend to improve the sequential recommendation via
random masking on the history item so as to generate self-supervised signals.
But such approaches will indeed result in sparser item sequence and unreliable
signals. Besides, the existing sequential recommendation models are only
user-centric, i.e., based on the historical items by chronological order to
predict the probability of candidate items, which ignores whether the items
from a provider can be successfully recommended. Such user-centric
recommendation will make it impossible for the provider to expose their new
items and result in popular bias.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Dual Contrastive Network (DCN) to generate
ground-truth self-supervised signals for sequential recommendation by auxiliary
user-sequence from an item-centric perspective. Specifically, we propose dual
representation contrastive learning to refine the representation learning by
minimizing the Euclidean distance between the representations of a given
user/item and history items/users of them. Before the second contrastive
learning module, we perform the next user prediction to capture the trends of
items preferred by certain types of users and provide personalized exploration
opportunities for item providers. Finally, we further propose dual interest
contrastive learning to self-supervise the dynamic interest from the next
item/user prediction and static interest of matching probability. Experiments
on four benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.
Further ablation study also illustrates the boosting effect of the proposed
components upon different sequential models.

utilizes modern hardware capabilities to organize a 3D asynchronous
reconstruction involving parallel read-write operations with storage drives,
CPU-GPU data transfers, and GPU computations. In the asynchronous
reconstruction, all the operations are timely overlapped to almost fully hide
all data management time. Since most cameras work with less than 16-bit digital
output, we furthermore optimize the memory usage and processing speed by using
16-bit floating-point arithmetic. As a result, 3D reconstruction with TomocuPy

reconstruction (including read-write operations and methods initialization) of
a 2048x2048x2048 tomographic volume takes less than 7~s on a single Nvidia
Tesla A100 and PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD, and scales almost linearly increasing the
data size. To simplify operation at synchrotron beamlines, TomocuPy provides an
easy-to-use command-line interface. Efficacy of the package was demonstrated

in kernel approximation for scalability of kernel methods. The theoretical
foundation of RFFs is based on the Bochner theorem that relates symmetric,
positive definite (PD) functions to probability measures. This condition
naturally excludes asymmetric functions with a wide range applications in
practice, e.g., directed graphs, conditional probability, and asymmetric
kernels. Nevertheless, understanding asymmetric functions (kernels) and its
scalability via RFFs is unclear both theoretically and empirically. In this
paper, we introduce a complex measure with the real and imaginary parts
corresponding to four finite positive measures, which expands the application
scope of the Bochner theorem. By doing so, this framework allows for handling
classical symmetric, PD kernels via one positive measure; symmetric,
non-positive definite kernels via signed measures; and asymmetric kernels via
complex measures, thereby unifying them into a general framework by RFFs, named
AsK-RFFs. Such approximation scheme via complex measures enjoys theoretical
guarantees in the perspective of the uniform convergence. In algorithmic
implementation, to speed up the kernel approximation process, which is
expensive due to the calculation of total mass, we employ a subset-based fast

  Spatial-Temporal Lens","10 pages,10 figures",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Forking breaches the security and performance of blockchain as it is
symptomatic of distributed consensus, spurring wide interest in analyzing and
resolving it. The state-of-the-art works can be categorized into two kinds:
experiment-based and model-based. However, the former falls short in
exclusiveness since the derived observations are scenario-specific. Hence, it
is problematic to abstractly reveal the crystal-clear forking laws. Besides,
the models established in the latter are spatiality-free, which totally
overlook the fact that forking is essentially an undesirable result under a
given topology. Moreover, few of the ongoing studies have yielded to the active
defense mechanisms but only recognized forking passively, which impedes forking
prevention and cannot deter it at the source. In this paper, we fill the gap by
carrying out the active defense analysis of blockchain forking from the
spatial-temporal dimension. Our work is featured by the following two traits:
1) dual dimensions. We consider the spatiality of blockchain overlay network
besides temporal characteristics, based on which, a spatial-temporal model for
information propagation in blockchain is proposed; 2) active defense. We hint
that shrinking the long-range link factor, which indicates the remote
connection ability of a link, can cut down forking completely fundamentally. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to inspect forking from the
spatial-temporal perspective, so as to present countermeasures proactively.
Solid theoretical derivations and extensive simulations are conducted to
justify the validity and effectiveness of our analysis.

For most real-world applications, however, actionable information is related to
semantically meaningful objects in the environment. We propose an approach to
the active metric-semantic mapping problem that enables multiple heterogeneous
robots to collaboratively build a map of the environment. The robots actively
explore to minimize the uncertainties in both semantic (object classification)
and geometric (object modeling) information. We represent the environment using
informative but sparse object models, each consisting of a basic shape and a
semantic class label, and characterize uncertainties empirically using a large
amount of real-world data. Given a prior map, we use this model to select
actions for each robot to minimize uncertainties. The performance of our
algorithm is demonstrated through multi-robot experiments in diverse real-world
environments. The proposed framework is applicable to a wide range of
real-world problems, such as precision agriculture, infrastructure inspection,
and asset mapping in factories. A demo video can be found at

by learning low-dimensional representation of observations through auxiliary

between these auxiliary objectives and the RL objective is often unclear. In
this work, we propose a single objective which jointly optimizes a latent-space
model and policy to achieve high returns while remaining self-consistent. This
objective is a lower bound on expected returns. Unlike prior bounds for
model-based RL on policy exploration or model guarantees, our bound is directly
on the overall RL objective. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm
matches or improves the sample-efficiency of the best prior model-based and
model-free RL methods. While sample efficient methods typically are
computationally demanding, our method attains the performance of SAC in about
50% less wall-clock time.

imposing problem is that big data is often interspersed with sensitive personal

(PP-HFNN) to address these technical challenges while also alleviating privacy
concerns. The network is trained with a two-stage optimization algorithm, and
the parameters at low levels of the hierarchy are learned with a scheme based
on the well-known alternating direction method of multipliers, which does not
reveal local data to other agents. Coordination at high levels of the hierarchy
is handled by the alternating optimization method, which converges very
quickly. The entire training procedure is scalable, fast and does not suffer
from gradient vanishing problems like the methods based on back-propagation.
Comprehensive simulations conducted on both regression and classification tasks

We first introduce a neural surface reconstructor for high-quality surface
generation in minutes. It marries the implicit volumetric rendering of the
truncated signed distance field (TSDF) with multi-resolution hash encoding. We
further propose a hybrid neural tracker to generate animated meshes, which
combines explicit non-rigid tracking with implicit dynamic deformation in a
self-supervised framework. The former provides the coarse warping back into the
canonical space, while the latter implicit one further predicts the
displacements using the 4D hash encoding as in our reconstructor. Then, we
discuss the rendering schemes using the obtained animated meshes, ranging from
dynamic texturing to lumigraph rendering under various bandwidth settings. To
strike an intricate balance between quality and bandwidth, we propose a
hierarchical solution by first rendering 6 virtual views covering the performer
and then conducting occlusion-aware neural texture blending. We demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in a variety of mesh-based applications and

sequences. In this work, we propose a fine-grained motion representation
network (GaitFM) to improve gait recognition performance in three aspects.
First, a fine-grained part sequence learning (FPSL) module is designed to
explore part-independent spatio-temporal representations. Secondly, a
frame-wise compression strategy, called local motion aggregation (LMA), is used
to enhance motion variations. Finally, a weighted generalized mean pooling
(WGeM) layer works to adaptively keep more discriminative information in the
spatial downsampling. Experiments on two public datasets, CASIA-B and OUMVLP,

we have (empirically) explored a new prospect for urban scaling analysis based
on relatively larger local administrative units, which are independently
functional, within a country. For this purpose, we have studied the scaling
laws across Indian districts for the various socio-economic indicators (SEIs)
within four distinct urbanization classes, namely rural, semi-rural, semi-urban
and urban districts, and presented the estimated values of the scaling factors
for each classes for the years 2001 and 2011 along with their goodness-of-fit
measured by the $R^2$ values. Our result shows that the scaling laws indeed
exist even at the district level for all most of the SEIs considered, related
to education, employment, housing, health, etc.; the $R^2$ values obtained for
these SEIs are very high (often greater than 0.8 or 0.9) in both the the years.
For a few SEIs, however, the validity of scaling law increases as we move from
rural to urban class of districts. The linearity of the scaling index has been
statistically tested and it has been found, at 95\% level of confidence, that
not all the SEIs behave linearly; some of them are characterized by
super-linear behaviour and some behave sub-linearly. Statistical hypothesis
tests have also been performed to test the equality of two scaling factors
corresponding to two distinct classes and two different years to understand the
differences in scaling relationships among increasing urbanisation classes and
their changes over time.

paper, we focus on the equi-join problem, where a pair of records from the two
joined tables are part of the join results if equality holds between their
values in the join column(s). While this is a tractable problem when the number
of records in the joined tables is relatively small, it becomes very
challenging as the table sizes increase, especially if hot keys (join column
values with a large number of records) exist in both joined tables.
  This paper, an extended version of [metwally-SIGMOD-2022], proposes
Adaptive-Multistage-Join (AM-Join) for scalable and fast equi-joins in
distributed shared-nothing architectures. AM-Join utilizes (a) Tree-Join, a
proposed novel algorithm that scales well when the joined tables share hot
keys, and (b) Broadcast-Join, the known fastest when joining keys that are hot
in only one table.
  Unlike the state-of-the-art algorithms, AM-Join (a) holistically solves the
join-skew problem by achieving load balancing throughout the join execution,
and (b) supports all outer-join variants without record deduplication or custom
table partitioning. For the fastest AM-Join outer-join performance, we propose
the Index-Broadcast-Join (IB-Join) family of algorithms for Small-Large joins,
where one table fits in memory and the other can be up to orders of magnitude
larger. The outer-join variants of IB-Join improves on the state-of-the-art
Small-Large outer-join algorithms.
  The proposed algorithms can be adopted in any shared-nothing architecture. We
implemented a MapReduce version using Spark. Our evaluation shows the proposed
algorithms execute significantly faster and scale to more skewed and
orders-of-magnitude bigger tables when compared to the state-of-the-art
algorithms.

triple systems, the meaning of ``stability'' is somewhat vague and has been
interpreted differently in previous literatures. The present paper focuses on
``Lagrange stability'', which roughly refers to the stability against the
escape of a body from the system, or ``disruption'' of the triple system, in
contrast to ``Lyapunov-like stability'' that is related to the chaotic nature
of the system dynamics. We compute the evolution of triple systems using direct
$N$-body simulations up to $10^7 P_\mathrm{out}$, which is significantly longer
than previous studies (with $P_\mathrm{out}$ being the initial orbital period
of the outer body). We obtain the resulting disruption timescale $T_\mathrm{d}$
as a function of the triple orbital parameters with particular attention to the
dependence on the mutual inclination between the inner and outer orbits,
$i_\mathrm{mut}$. By doing so, we have clarified explicitly the difference
between Lagrange and Lyapunov stabilities in astronomical triples. Furthermore,
we find that the von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov oscillations significantly destabilize
inclined triples (roughly with $60^\circ < i_\mathrm{mut} < 150^\circ$)
relative to those with $i_\mathrm{mut}=0^\circ$. On the other hand, retrograde
triples with $i_\mathrm{mut}>160^\circ$ become strongly stabilized with much
longer disruption timescales. We show the sensitivity of the normalized
disruption timescale $T_\mathrm{d}/P_\mathrm{out}$ to the orbital parameters of
triple system. The resulting $T_\mathrm{d}/P_\mathrm{out}$ distribution is
practically more useful in a broad range of astronomical applications than the
stability criterion based on the Lyapunov divergence.

However, the understanding of this abnormal phenomenon has remained elusive. In

friend scenario, demonstrated that certain empirical correlations predicted by
quantum theory (QT) violate inequalities derived from a set of metaphysical
assumptions we called ""Local Friendliness"" (LF). These assumptions are strictly
weaker than those used for deriving Bell inequalities. Crucial to the theorem
was the premise that a quantum system with reversible evolution could be an
observer (colloquially, a ""friend""). However, that paper was noncommittal on
what would constitute an observer for the purpose of an experiment. Here, we
present a new LF no-go theorem which takes seriously the idea that a system's
having thoughts is a sufficient condition for it to be an observer. Our new
derivation of the LF inequalities uses four metaphysical assumptions, three of
which are thought-related, including one that is explicitly called
""Friendliness"". These four assumptions, in conjunction, imply LF for the type
of friend that Friendliness commits one to accepting as an observer. In
addition to these four metaphysical assumptions, this new no-go theorem
requires two assumptions about what is technologically feasible: Human-Level
Artificial Intelligence, and Universal Quantum Computing which is fast and
large scale. The latter is often motivated by the belief that QT is universal,
but this is not an assumption of the theorem. The intent of the new theorem is
to give a clear goal for future experimentalists, and a clear motivation for
trying to achieve that goal, by using carefully chosen and widely held
assumptions. The popular stance that ""quantum theory needs no interpretation""
does not question any of our assumptions and so is ruled out by the theorem.
Finally, we quantitatively discuss how difficult the experiment we envisage
would be, and briefly discuss milestones on the paths towards it.

are protected by topology and symmetry. Their properties depend on the
dimensions of the systems. It has been theoretically demonstrated that
five-dimensional (5D) Weyl semimetals emerge as novel phases during the
topological phase transition in analogy to the three-dimensional case. However,
experimental observation of such a phenomenon remains a great challenge because
the tunable 5D system is extremely hard to construct in real space. Here, we
construct 5D electric circuit platforms in fully real space and experimentally
observe topological phase transitions in five dimensions. Not only are Yang
monopoles and linked Weyl surfaces observed experimentally, but various phase
transitions in five dimensions are also proved, such as the phase transitions
from a normal insulator to a Hopf link of twoWeyl surfaces and then to a 5D
topological insulator. The demonstrated topological phase transitions in five
dimensions leverage the concept of higher-dimensional Weyl physics to control
electrical signals in the engineered circuits.

intriguing phenomenon in that the normal side takes on the properties of a
superconductor with an induced gap. However, the structural and pinning
properties of vortices inside the normal regions remain poorly understood.
Here, we report structure and superconducting properties of a proximity-coupled
Mg/MgO/MgB2 system with ~30 vol. % of superconducting MgB2, in which MgB2
nanograins are distributed in a fractal manner to form a proximity network with
clean interfaces. Conductivity and magnetic measurements demonstrate that this
proximity-coupled system acts as a fully phase coherent superconductor with
isotropic pinning. Magneto-optical imaging also reveals a rather homogeneous
flux density distribution with no apparent granularity. Furthermore, we observe
quantized proximity vortices and their clustering behavior by scanning
superconducting quantum interface device microscopy. These results show that in
contrast to the case of conventional granular superconductors, the grain
boundaries in the present sample carry high critical currents and have high
vortex pinning efficiency, resulting in a robust phase coherent state
irrespective of the low volume fraction of the MgB2 nanograins. This finding
not only reveals the features of proximity-induced vortices, but also
demonstrates an excellent phase-locked capability of the proximity-coupled
fractal system.

the present trip is the most useful with the least amount of data. In addition,
there are a large amount of other data, e.g., other vehicles' state and past

four groups according to their spatial and temporal distance from the present
matching probe which allows us to sort for their usefulness. Then we design
three different methods to extract valuable information (scores) from them: a
score for speed and bearing, a score for historical usage, and a score for
traffic state using the spectral graph Markov neutral network. Finally, we use
a modified top-K shortest-path method to search the candidate paths within an

application it is necessary to analyze it for stress concentration as one of
the parameter. Literature survey reveals that the failure of FRC due to
breakage of fiber is a cumulative process. If a fiber breaks stress
concentration develops near the failure which leads to failure of other fibers
in its vicinity. This process continues until the whole FRC gets failed. This
phenomenon is quantified by a parameter called Stress Transfer Coefficient
(STC). To analyze FRC generally it is practiced to analyze Representative
Volume Element (RVE) which is a representation of the complete FRC. Another
important aspect which is considered while analyzing FRC is the distribution of
the fiber. Ideally the distribution of fibers should be uniform but no
manufacturing process guarantees uniform distribution. Thus while analyzing FRC
it is a good practice to generate RVE with randomly distributed fibers. In this
paper an attempt is made to attain the relationship between volume fraction and

different volume fraction are analyzed. A new method is implemented to generate
RVE with randomly distributed fibers. RVEs are so generated that it contains a
broken fiber at its geometrical center and other fibers surrounding it. The RVE

distributed computation. However, BFT protocols suffer from the ordering
manipulation, in which an adversary can make front-running. Several protocols
are proposed to resolve the manipulation problem, but there are some
limitations for them. The batch-based protocols such as Themis has significant
performance loss because of the use of complex algorithms to find strongly
connected components (SCCs). The timestamp-based protocols such as Pompe have
simplified the ordering phase, but they are limited on fairness that the
adversary can manipulate the ordering via timestamps of transactions. In this
paper, we propose a Byzantine ordered consensus protocol called Phalanx, in
which transactions are committed by anchor-based ordering strategy. The
anchor-based strategy makes aggregation of the Lamport logical clock of
transactions on each participant and generates the final ordering without
complex detection for SCCs. Therefore, Phalanx has achieved satisfying
performance and performs better in resisting ordering manipulation than

binomial distribution of the clumpy nebular regions with a continuous Gaussian
distribution and omitting the dust scattering effect, our model solves the dust
attenuation process for both the emission lines and stellar continua via
analytical approaches. Our Chocolate Chip Cookie model successfully fits the
inclination dependence of both the effective dust reddening of the stellar
components derived from stellar population synthesis and that of the emission
lines characterized by the Balmer decrement for a large sample of Milky-Way
like disk galaxies selected from the main galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital

times thinner and 1.6 times larger than the stellar disk for MW-like galaxies,
whereas each clumpy region has a typical optical depth $\tau_{\rm{cl,V}} \sim
0.5$ in $V$ band. After considering the aperture effect, our model prediction
on the inclination dependence of dust attenuation is also consistent with
observations. Not only that, in our model, the dust attenuation curve of the
stellar population naturally depends on inclination and its median case is
consistent with the classical Calzetti law. Since the modelling constraints are
from the optical wavelengths, our model is unaffected by the optically thick

We propose a novel deep fusion architecture that fuses visual and tactile data

stock markets, here we precisely measure the property of return distribution of
composite index over the time scale $\Delta t$ ranging from 1 min up to almost
4,000 min. The main findings are as follows. (1) Return distribution presents a
leptokurtic, fat-tailed, and almost symmetrical shape, which is similar to that
of mature markets. (2) The central part of return distribution is well
described by the symmetrical L\'{e}vy $\alpha$-stable process with a stability
parameter comparable with the value of about 1.4 extracted in the U.S. stock
market. (3) Return distribution can be well described by the student's
t-distribution within a wider return range than the L\'{e}vy $\alpha$-stable
distribution. (4) Distinctively, the stability parameter shows a potential
change when $\Delta t$ increases, and thus a crossover region at 15 $< \Delta t
<$ 60 min is observed. This is different from the finding in the U.S. stock
market where a single value of about 1.4 holds over 1 $\le \Delta t \le$ 1,000
min. (5) The tail distribution of returns at small $\Delta t$ decays as an
asymptotic power-law with an exponent of about 3, which is a value widely
existing in mature markets. However, it decays exponentially when $\Delta t
\ge$ 240 min, which is not observed in mature markets. (6) Return distributions
gradually converge to Gaussian as $\Delta t$ increases. This observation is
different from the finding of a critical $\Delta t =$ 4 days in the U.S. stock
market.

using the null space to track secondary targets, with a precision determined by
the training dataset. Using a 2D example associated with time input we show
that our non-parametric solution compares favourably with a state-of-the-art

show that it permits on-the-fly adaptation as well.

the confusion of VQA model on such instances. To solve this problem, we propose
a novel training framework that explicitly encourages the VQA model to

segmentation into independently moving rigid objects and their SE(3)-motions.
SF2SE3 operates on two consecutive stereo or RGB-D images. First, noisy scene
flow is obtained by application of existing optical flow and depth estimation
algorithms. SF2SE3 then iteratively (1) samples pixel sets to compute
SE(3)-motion proposals, and (2) selects the best SE(3)-motion proposal with
respect to a maximum coverage formulation. Finally, objects are formed by
assigning pixels uniquely to the selected SE(3)-motions based on consistency
with the input scene flow and spatial proximity. The main novelties are a more
informed strategy for the sampling of motion proposals and a maximum coverage
formulation for the proposal selection. We conduct evaluations on multiple
datasets regarding application of SF2SE3 for scene flow estimation, object
segmentation and visual odometry. SF2SE3 performs on par with the state of the
art for scene flow estimation and is more accurate for segmentation and
odometry.

a pairwise interaction based on an online hgrid space decomposition is used. It
ensures that all UAVs simultaneously explore distinct regions, using only
asynchronous and limited communication. Further, we optimize the coverage paths
of unknown space and balance the workloads partitioned to each UAV with a
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem(CVRP) formulation. Given the task
allocation, each UAV constantly updates the coverage path and incrementally
extracts crucial information to support the exploration planning. A
hierarchical planner finds exploration paths, refines local viewpoints and
generates minimum-time trajectories in sequence to explore the unknown space
agilely and safely. The proposed approach is evaluated extensively, showing
high exploration efficiency, scalability and robustness to limited

collaborative exploration with multiple UAVs in real world. We will release our

puzzling detection of soft excess could be associated with the outflow,
indicated by the morphological correspondences between soft X-ray emission and
figure-eight-shaped radio bubbles. An anomalous narrow emission line with the
centroid energy $\sim4.97$ keV is found. If attributed to redshifted highly
ionized iron emission (e.g., Fe xxv), the required outflow velocity is
$\sim0.23\,c$. An alternative explanation is that this line emission could be

the structure of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) efficiently. The
algorithm optimizes the PQC structure on-the-fly in VQA by sequentially
replacing a single-qubit gate with the optimal one to minimize the objective
function. To directly find the optimal gate, our method uses the factorization
of matrices whose elements are evaluated on a set of the slightly-modified
circuits. The matrix factorization enables us to not only unify the existing
sequential methods for further extension but also provide rigorous proofs of
their limitation and potential in comparison with conventional gradient-based
optimizers. Firstly, when the circuits are sufficiently deep, the sequential
methods encounter a barren plateau that the spectrum of the matrix concentrates
on a single value exponentially fast with respect to the number of qubits.
Secondly, if the objective functions are local observables, they can avoid
barren plateaus as long as the depth of the n-qubit PQCs is $O(\log{n})$.
Although the family of these optimizers does not directly employ gradients of
the objective function, our results establish their connection with
conventional optimizations providing a consistent picture of the barren
plateau. We also perform numerical experiments showing the advantages over
conventional VQAs and confirm the successful optimization getting over the
barren plateau in the ground state problem of the mixed field Ising model up to
12 qubits.

association is conducted to match each MBE with the obstacle in the current
frame. Considering MBE as an observation, Kalman filter (KF) is used to
estimate and predict the motion state of the obstacle. In this way, the
trajectory of each obstacle in the forward time domain can be parameterized as

semi-minor axes of the parameterized ellipse are extended to ensure safety. We
extend the traditional Control Barrier Function (CBF) and propose Dynamic

sensitive or confidential information about their training data. Recently,
leakage due to distribution inference (or property inference) attacks is
gaining attention. In this attack, the goal of an adversary is to infer
distributional information about the training data. So far, research on
distribution inference has focused on demonstrating successful attacks, with
little attention given to identifying the potential causes of the leakage and
to proposing mitigations. To bridge this gap, as our main contribution, we
theoretically and empirically analyze the sources of information leakage that
allows an adversary to perpetrate distribution inference attacks. We identify
three sources of leakage: (1) memorizing specific information about the
$\mathbb{E}[Y|X]$ (expected label given the feature values) of interest to the
adversary, (2) wrong inductive bias of the model, and (3) finiteness of the
training data. Next, based on our analysis, we propose principled mitigation
techniques against distribution inference attacks. Specifically, we demonstrate
that causal learning techniques are more resilient to a particular type of
distribution inference risk termed distributional membership inference than
associative learning methods. And lastly, we present a formalization of
distribution inference that allows for reasoning about more general adversaries
than was previously possible.

capabilities beyond conventional computers for certain problems. However, the
physical qubits within a quantum computer are prone to noise and decoherence,
which must be corrected in order to perform reliable, fault-tolerant quantum
computations. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) provides the path for realizing
such computations. QEC continuously generates a continuous stream of data that
decoders must process at the rate it is received, which can be as fast as 1 MHz
in superconducting quantum computers. A little known fact of QEC is that if the
decoder infrastructure cannot keep up, a data backlog problem is encountered
and the quantum computer runs exponentially slower. Today's leading approaches
to quantum error correction are not scalable as existing decoders typically run
slower as the problem size is increased, inevitably hitting the backlog
problem. That is: the current leading proposal for fault-tolerant quantum
computation is not scalable. Here, we show how to parallelize decoding to
achieve almost arbitrary speed, removing this roadblock to scalability. Our
parallelization requires some classical feed forward decisions to be delayed,
leading to a slow-down of the logical clock speed. However, the slow-down is
now only polynomial in code size, averting the exponential slowdown. We
numerically demonstrate our parallel decoder for the surface code, showing no
noticeable reduction in logical fidelity compared to previous decoders and
demonstrating the parallelization speedup.

networks (DNNs). Lately, coresets (provable data summarizations) were leveraged
for pruning DNNs, adding the advantage of theoretical guarantees on the
trade-off between the compression rate and the approximation error. However,
coresets in this domain were either data-dependent or generated under
restrictive assumptions on both the model's weights and inputs. In real-world
scenarios, such assumptions are rarely satisfied, limiting the applicability of
coresets. To this end, we suggest a novel and robust framework for computing
such coresets under mild assumptions on the model's weights and without any
assumption on the training data. The idea is to compute the importance of each
neuron in each layer with respect to the output of the following layer. This is
achieved by a combination of L\""{o}wner ellipsoid and Caratheodory theorem. Our
method is simultaneously data-independent, applicable to various networks and

Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing coreset based

index, both boundary values and critical value are controversial. In this
paper, a novel method is proposed to derive the boundary values of Moran's

naturally for Moran's index. One is determined by the eigenvalues of spatial

autocorrelation coefficient (-1<Moran's I<1). The intersection of these two
sets of boundary values gives four possible numerical ranges of Moran's index.

size vector and spatial weight matrix, and the basic boundary values are -1 and
1. The eigenvalues of spatial weight matrix represent the maximum extension
length of the eigenvector axes of n geographical elements at different

mmLayout, coarse-grained information is aggregated from fine-grained, and then,
after further processing, is fused back into fine-grained for final prediction.
Furthermore, common sense enhancement is introduced to exploit the semantic

  Layout-Conforming Replay of Place Cells",,,,,"q-bio.NC cs.AI cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent experimental observations have shown that the reactivation of
hippocampal place cells (PC) during sleep or immobility depicts trajectories
that can go around barriers and can flexibly adapt to a changing maze layout.
Such layout-conforming replay sheds a light on how the activity of place cells
supports the learning of flexible navigation of an animal in a dynamically
changing maze. However, existing computational models of replay fall short of
generating layout-conforming replay, restricting their usage to simple
environments, like linear tracks or open fields. In this paper, we propose a
computational model that generates layout-conforming replay and explains how
such replay drives the learning of flexible navigation in a maze. First, we
propose a Hebbian-like rule to learn the inter-PC synaptic strength during
exploring a maze. Then we use a continuous attractor network (CAN) with
feedback inhibition to model the interaction among place cells and hippocampal
interneurons. The activity bump of place cells drifts along a path in the maze,
which models layout-conforming replay. During replay in rest, the synaptic
strengths from place cells to striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) are learned
by a novel dopamine-modulated three-factor rule to store place-reward
associations. During goal-directed navigation, the CAN periodically generates
replay trajectories from the animal's location for path planning, and the
trajectory leading to a maximal MSN activity is followed by the animal. We have
implemented our model into a high-fidelity virtual rat in the MuJoCo physics
simulator. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that its superior
flexibility during navigation in a maze is due to a continuous re-learning of
inter-PC and PC-MSN synaptic strength.

the way of classical symbol execution, which gets test cases by calculating

store the test case space with only a few qubits. According to the conditional

the spacecraft flexible structure urgently needs to be solved. Magnetic fluids
are a type of multi-functional smart materials, which can be employed in shock
absorbers to eliminate these vibrations. Referring to the calculation methods
of stiffness coefficients of other passive dampers, the stiffness coefficient
formula of magnetic fluid shock absorbers (MFSAs) was derived. Meanwhile, a
novel stiffness adjustable magnetic fluid shock absorber (SA-MFSA) was
proposed. On the basis of the second-order buoyancy principle, a series of
SA-MFSAs were fabricated. The range of stiffness coefficients covered by these
SA-MFSAs contains the optimal stiffness coefficient estimated by formulas. The
repulsive force measurement and vibration attenuation experiments were
conducted on these SA-MFSAs. In the case of small amplitude, the relationship
between the repulsive force and the offset distance was linear. The simulation
and experiment curves of repulsive forces were in good agreement. The results

Hamilton-Jacobi equation for test particles. For all the solutions obtained,
the analytical form of the tidal acceleration vector in a strong primordial

synchronous coordinate system is associated with a freely falling observer and
allows the observer to separate time and spatial coordinates, as well as to
synchronize time at different points in space. The presented mathematical

their effectiveness in leveraging unlabeled samples over interconnected
networks, where agents cannot share their original data with each other and can
only communicate non-sensitive information with their neighbors. However,
existing DSSL algorithms cannot cope with data uncertainties and may suffer
from high computation and communication overhead problems. To handle these
issues, we propose a distributed semi-supervised fuzzy regression (DSFR) model
with fuzzy if-then rules and interpolation consistency regularization (ICR).
The ICR, which was proposed recently for semi-supervised problem, can force
decision boundaries to pass through sparse data areas, thus increasing model
robustness. However, its application in distributed scenarios has not been
considered yet. In this work, we proposed a distributed Fuzzy C-means (DFCM)
method and a distributed interpolation consistency regularization (DICR) built
on the well-known alternating direction method of multipliers to respectively
locate parameters in antecedent and consequent components of DSFR. Notably, the
DSFR model converges very fast since it does not involve back-propagation
procedure and is scalable to large-scale datasets benefiting from the
utilization of DFCM and DICR. Experiments results on both artificial and
real-world datasets show that the proposed DSFR model can achieve much better
performance than the state-of-the-art DSSL algorithm in terms of both loss

this work, deep learning techniques developed especially for time-series

are employed to model the system dynamics for advection dominated problems.
These models take as input a sequence of high-fidelity vector solutions for
consecutive time-steps obtained from the PDEs and forecast the solutions for
the subsequent time-steps using auto-regression; thereby reducing the
computation time and power needed to obtain such high-fidelity solutions. The
models are tested on numerical benchmarks (1D Burgers' equation and Stoker's
dam break problem) to assess the long-term prediction accuracy, even outside

techniques such as deep auto-encoder networks are utilized to compress the
high-fidelity snapshots before feeding them as input to the forecasting models
in order to reduce the complexity and the required computations in the online

quantification of the forecasting models, which provides information about the
variance of the predictions as a result of the epistemic uncertainties.

multi-level inter-molecular interactions between proteins and ligands, which
often lead to sub-optimal performance. To solve this issue, we propose a novel
global-local interaction (GLI) framework to predict protein-ligand binding

interactions between proteins and ligands, which involve not only the
high-energy short-range interactions between closed atoms but also the
low-energy long-range interactions between non-bonded atoms. For each pair of
protein and ligand, our GLI embeds the long-range interactions globally and
aggregates local short-range interactions, respectively. Such a joint
global-local interaction modeling strategy helps to improve prediction
accuracy, and the whole framework is compatible with various neural
network-based modules. Experiments demonstrate that our GLI framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods with simple neural network architectures
