most common ones for measuring quality of hard decisions are standard and
balanced accuracy, standard and balanced error rate, F-beta score, and Matthews
correlation coefficient (MCC). In this document, we review the definition of
these and other metrics and compare them with the expected cost (EC), a metric
introduced in every statistical learning course but rarely used in the machine
learning literature. We show that both the standard and balanced error rates
are special cases of the EC. Further, we show its relation with F-score and MCC
and argue that EC is superior to these traditional metrics, being more elegant,
general, and intuitive, as well as being based on basic principles from
statistics.
  The metrics above measure the quality of hard decisions. Yet, most modern
classification systems output continuous scores for the classes which we may
want to evaluate directly. Metrics for measuring the quality of system scores
include the area under the ROC curve, equal error rate, cross-entropy, Brier
score, and Bayes EC or Bayes risk, among others. The last three metrics are
special cases of a family of metrics given by the expected value of proper
scoring rules (PSRs). We review the theory behind these metrics and argue that
they are the most principled way to measure the quality of the posterior
probabilities produced by a system. Finally, we show how to use these metrics
to compute the system's calibration loss and compare this metric with the
standard expected calibration error (ECE), arguing that calibration loss based
on PSRs is superior to the ECE for a variety of reasons.

Flocking and clustering are two representative dynamic phases. The relationship

between flocking and clustering phases under different initial states, and
observe an unstable domain in order parameters phase diagrams due to initial

from the previous finding that active angular fluctuations lead to an earlier

In particular, we find that the existence of bi-stable states is due to the
diversity of dynamic paths arising from different initial states. By increasing
(decreasing) the initial degree of ordering, the bi-stable state can be shifted
to a more ordered flocking (disordered clustering) state. These results
enlighten us pave the way to manipulate emergent behaviors and collective

to a graph problem, we investigate how much effort is needed to turn it into a
proper solution. For example, if we have a partial coloring of a graph, how
hard is it to turn it into a proper coloring?
  In prior work (SIROCCO 2022), this question was formalized and studied from
the perspective of mending radius: if there is a hole that we need to patch,
how far do we need to modify the solution? In this work, we investigate a
complementary notion of mending volume: how many nodes need to be modified to
patch a hole?
  We focus on the case of locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs) in trees,
and show that already in this setting there are two infinite hierarchies of
problems: for infinitely many values $0 < \alpha \le 1$, there is an LCL
problem with mending volume $\Theta(n^\alpha)$, and for infinitely many values
$k \ge 1$, there is an LCL problem with mending volume $\Theta(\log^k n)$.
Hence the mendability of LCL problems on trees is a much more fine-grained
question than what one would expect based on the mending radius alone.
  We define three variants of the theme: (1) existential mending volume, i.e.,
how many nodes need to be modified, (2) expected mending volume, i.e., how many
nodes we need to explore to find a patch if we use randomness, and (3)
deterministic mending volume, i.e., how many nodes we need to explore if we use
a deterministic algorithm. We show that all three notions are distinct from
each other, and we analyze the landscape of the complexities of LCL problems
for the respective models.

of architectures and datasets and how they vary with factors such as network
width and training time. While practical influence function estimates may be a
poor match to leave-one-out retraining for nonlinear networks, we show they are
often a good approximation to a different object we term the proximal Bregman

by theory and simulation, has unambiguously proved that suitable colloidal
particles can indeed form $N_B$ fluids under specific conditions. While this
discovery has sparked a widespread interest in the characterisation of the
phase behaviour of $N_B$ liquid crystals, significantly less attention has been
devoted to the study of their transport properties. To bridge this gap, by
Dynamic Monte Carlo simulations we have investigated the equilibrium dynamics
of field-induced $N_B$ phases comprising monodisperse hard cuboids. In
particular, we calculated the long-time self-diffusion coefficients of cuboids
over a wide range of anisotropies, spanning prolate to oblate geometries.
Additionally, we have compared these diffusivities with those that, upon
switching the external field off, are measured in the thermodynamically-stable
isotropic or uniaxial nematic phases at the same density. Our results indicate
that while prolate cuboids diffuse significantly faster in biaxial nematics
than in less ordered fluids, we do not observe such an increase with oblate
cuboids at high packing fractions. We show that these changes are most likely
due to the field-induced freezing of the axes perpendicular to the nematic
director, along with a substantial increase in the ordering of the resulting
$N_B$ phase.

momentum is symmetrically distributed between the incoming and outgoing

calculation for each value of the momentum transfer, increasing significantly
the computational cost. In this work, by focusing on the quasi-distribution
approach, we lay the foundation for faster and more effective lattice QCD
calculations of GPDs exploiting asymmetric frames, with freedom in the
transferred momentum distribution. An important ingredient of our approach is
the Lorentz covariant parameterization of the matrix elements in terms of
Lorentz-invariant amplitudes, which allows one to relate matrix elements in
different frames. We also use this amplitude approach to propose a new
definition of quasi-GPDs that is frame-independent and, more importantly, may
lead to smaller power corrections in the matching relations to the light-cone
GPDs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the formalism through numerical
calculations using one ensemble of $N_f$=2+1+1 twisted mass fermions with a
clover improvement. The value of the light-quark masses lead to a pion mass of
about 260 MeV. Concentrating on the proton, and limiting ourselves to a
vanishing longitudinal momentum transfer to the target, we extract the
invariant amplitudes from matrix element calculations in both the symmetric and

the liquid is metastable. In our simulations this is demonstrated when noise in
the initial density distribution is used to induce nucleation events from the
metastable liquid. Depending on the strength of the initial noise, we observe a
variety of nucleation pathways, in agreement with previous results for the PFC
model, and which show that amorphous precursor mediated multi-step crystal
nucleation can occur in colloidal systems.

as coarse optimization, cheaper computation of derivatives, and a high
convergence rate. However, to take advantage of these benefits in model
predictive control (MPC) for legged robots, it is crucial to handle efficiently
its large number of equality constraints. To accomplish this, we first (i)
propose a novel approach to handle equality constraints based on nullspace
parametrization. Our approach balances optimality, and both dynamics and
equality-constraint feasibility appropriately, which increases the basin of
attraction to high-quality local minima. To do so, we (ii) modify our
feasibility-driven search by incorporating a merit function. Furthermore, we
introduce (iii) a condensed formulation of inverse dynamics that considers
arbitrary actuator models. We also propose (iv) a novel MPC based on inverse
dynamics within a perceptive locomotion framework. Finally, we present (v) a
theoretical comparison of optimal control with forward and inverse dynamics and
evaluate both numerically. Our approach enables the first application of
inverse-dynamics MPC on hardware, resulting in state-of-the-art dynamic
climbing on the ANYmal robot. We benchmark it over a wide range of robotics
problems and generate agile and complex maneuvers. We show the computational
reduction of our nullspace resolution and condensed formulation (up to 47.3%).
We provide evidence of the benefits of our approach by solving coarse
optimization problems with a high convergence rate (up to 10 Hz of
discretization). Our algorithm is publicly available inside CROCODDYL.

pharmaceutical intervention, especially through compounds that block their
pore-forming activity. Here we add to the growing literature concerning the
structure and function of viroporins by studying and comparing -- through
molecular dynamics simulations -- the folding of the transmembrane domain
peptides of viroporins derived from four viruses : influenza A, influenza B,
and the coronaviruses MERS-Cov-2 and SARS-CoV-2. Through a total of more than
50 {\mu}s of simulation time in explicit solvent (TFE) and with full
electrostatics, we characterize the folding behavior, helical stability and
helical propensity of these transmembrane peptides in their monomeric state and
we identify common motifs that may reflect their quaternary organization and/or
biological function. We show that the two influenza-derived peptides are
significantly different in peptide sequence and secondary structure from the
two coronavirus-derived peptides, and that they are organized in two
structurally distinct parts : a significantly more stable N-terminal half, and
a fast converting C-terminal half that continuously folds and unfolds between
$\alpha$-helical structures and non-canonical structures which are mostly

more stable and fast helix formers when compared with the influenza ones. We
discuss possible interpretations of these findings and their putative

disorder. Its main symptoms include difficulty in (verbal and/or non-verbal)
communication, and rigid/repetitive behavior. These symptoms are often
indistinguishable from a normal (control) individual, due to which this
disorder remains undiagnosed in early childhood leading to delayed treatment.
Since the learning curve is steep during the initial age, an early diagnosis of
autism could allow to take adequate interventions at the right time, which
might positively affect the growth of an autistic child. Further, the
traditional methods of autism diagnosis require multiple visits to a
specialized psychiatrist, however this process can be time-consuming. In this
paper, we present a learning based approach to automate autism diagnosis using
simple and small action video clips of subjects. This task is particularly
challenging because the amount of annotated data available is small, and the
variations among samples from the two categories (ASD and control) are
generally indistinguishable. This is also evident from poor performance of a
binary classifier learned using the cross-entropy loss on top of a baseline
encoder. To address this, we adopt contrastive feature learning in both self
supervised and supervised learning frameworks, and show that these can lead to
a significant increase in the prediction accuracy of a binary classifier on
this task. We further validate this by conducting thorough experimental
analyses under different set-ups on two publicly available datasets.

applying the isochron approach using chromite, metal-silicate-sulphide and

genealogical constraints on the accretion region of the EC 002 parent body. The
54Cr and 17O isotope compositions of EC 002 confirm its origin in the

changes in energy and changes in alignment never occur during the same Monte
Carlo (MC) step. This orthogonal Ising model (OIM) allows conservation of
energy and conservation of momentum to proceed independently, on their own
preferred time scales. MC simulations of the OIM mimic more than twenty
distinctive characteristics that are commonly found above and below the glass
temperature, Tg. Examples include a specific heat that has hysteresis around
Tg, out-of-phase loss that exhibits primary and secondary peaks,
super-Arrhenius T dependence for the alpha response time, and fragilities that
increase with increasing system size (N). Mean-field theory for energy
fluctuations in the OIM yields a novel expression for the super-Arrhenius
divergence. Because this divergence is reminiscent of the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann
(VFT) law squared, we call it the VFT2 law. A modified Stickel plot, which
linearizes the VFT2 law, gives qualitatively consistent agreement with
measurements of primary response (from the literature) on five glass-forming
liquids. Such agreement with the OIM suggests that several basic features
govern supercooled liquids. The freezing of a liquid into a glass involves an
underlying 2nd-order transition that is broadened by finite-size effects. The
VFT2 law comes from energy fluctuations that enhance the pathways through an
entropy bottleneck, not activation over an energy barrier. Primary response
times vary exponentially with inverse N, consistent with the distribution of
relaxation times deduced from measurements. System sizes found via the T
dependence of the primary response are similar to sizes of independently
relaxing regions measured by nuclear magnetic resonance for simple-molecule
glass-forming liquids. The OIM provides a broad foundation for more-detailed

learning utilizes the knowledge from similar tasks and thus has also been
intensively studied. However, due to the limited radio spectrum, the
communication efficiency of federated learning via wireless links is critical
since some tasks may require thousands of Terabytes of uplink payload. In order
to improve the communication efficiency, we in this paper propose the
feature-based federated transfer learning as an innovative approach to reduce
the uplink payload by more than five orders of magnitude compared to that of
existing approaches. We first introduce the system design in which the
extracted features and outputs are uploaded instead of parameter updates, and
then determine the required payload with this approach and provide comparisons
with the existing approaches. Subsequently, we analyze the random shuffling
scheme that preserves the clients' privacy. Finally, we evaluate the
performance of the proposed learning scheme via experiments on an image
classification task to show its effectiveness.

temperatures well above the hopping strength, the Curie-Weiss form of the
magnetic susceptibility suggests effective antiferromagnetic correlations for
systems that are hole doped with respect to $\nu=1$, and ferromagnetic
correlations for systems with electron dopings. We show that these correlations
arise from magnetic polaron dressing of charge carrier propagating in a spin
incoherent Mott insulator. Effective interactions corresponding to these
correlations can strongly exceed the magnetic super-exchange energy. In the
case of hole doping, antiferromagnetic polarons originate from kinetic
frustration of individual holes in a triangular lattice. In the case of
electron doping, Nagaoka type ferromagnetic correlations are induced by
propagating doublons. These results provide a theoretical explanation of recent
experimental results in moire TMDC materials. To understand many-body states
arising from antiferromagentic polarons at low temperatures, we study hole
doped systems in finite magnetic fields. At low dopings and intermediate
magnetic fields we find a magnetic polaron phase, separated from the fully
polarized state by a metamagnetic transition. With decreasing magnetic field
the system shows a tendency to phase separate, with hole rich regions forming
antiferromagnetic spinbags. We demonstrate that direct observations of magnetic
polarons in triangular lattices can be achieved in experiments with ultracold

us to compute Kronheimer and Mrowka's $s^\sharp$-invariant and fractional ideal

quasi-additivity property of $s^\sharp$, answering a question of Gong. We also
introduce invariants that are formally similar to the Heegaard Floer
$\tau$-invariant of Oszv\'ath and Szab\'o and the $\varepsilon$-invariant of
Hom. We provide evidence for a precise relationship between these latter two
invariants and the $s^\sharp$-invariant.
  Some new topological applications that follow from our techniques are as
follows. First, we produce a wide class of patterns whose induced satellite
maps on the concordance group have the property that their images have infinite
rank, giving a partial answer to a conjecture of Hedden and Pinz\'on-Caicedo.
Second, we produce infinitely many two-bridge knots $K$ which are torsion in
the algebraic concordance group and yet have the property that the set of
positive $1/n$-surgeries on $K$ is a linearly independent set in the homology
cobordism group. Finally, for a knot which is quasi-positive and not slice, we
prove that any concordance from the knot admits an irreducible
$SU(2)$-representation on the fundamental group of the concordance complement.
  While much of the paper focuses on constructions using singular instanton

intended for the legitimate receiver (or Bob for brevity) and the eavesdropper
(Eve) is interested only in the secret messages of all users. By allowing users
with zero secret message rate to act as conventional MAC channel users with no
wiretapping, we show that the achievable region of the discrete memoryless (DM)
MAC-WT channel given in [1] can be enlarged. In [1], the achievability was
proven by considering the two-user case, making it possible to prove a key
auxiliary lemma by directly using the Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure.
However, this approach does not generalize to the case with any number of
users. In this paper, we provide a new region that generally enlarges that in
[1] and provide general achievability proof. Furthermore, we consider the
Gaussian vector (GV) MAC-WT channel and maximize the sum secrecy rate by
precoder design. Although this non-convex problem can be solved by the
majorization minimization (MM) technique, this suffers from an extremely high
computational complexity. Instead, we propose a simultaneous diagonalization
based low-complexity (SDLC) method to maximize the secrecy rate of a simple
single-user wiretap channel, and then use this method to iteratively optimize
the covariance matrix of each user in the GV MAC-WT channel at hand. Simulation
results show that, compared with existing approaches, the SDLC scheme achieves
similar secrecy performance but requires much lower complexity. It is also
shown that the system spectral efficiency can be significantly increased by
simultaneously transmitting secret and open messages.

Traditionally, robot mowing is perceived as a ""Coverage Path Planning"" problem,
with a simplification that converts non-convex obstacles into convex obstacles.
Besides, the converted obstacles are commonly dilated by the robot's
circumcircle for collision avoidance. However when applied to robot mowing, an
obstacle in a lawn is usually non-convex, imagine a garden on the lawn, such
that the mentioned obstacle processing methods would fill in some concave areas

inescapable uncut areas along the lawn edge, which dulls the landscape's

which indicates that some predictable information remains. In this study, to
capture the correlation of errors, we introduce ResCAL, a residual estimation

existing traffic forecasting models. Our ResCAL calibrates the prediction of
the existing models in real time by estimating future errors using previous
errors and graph signals. Extensive experiments on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY

robustness against out-of-distribution samples and corner cases is crucial to
avoid dangerous consequences. Since real-world datasets cannot contain enough
data points to properly sample the long tail of the underlying distribution,
models must be able to deal with unknown and unseen scenarios as well. Previous

In this work, we propose the necessary step to extend segmentation with a new
task which we term holistic segmentation. The aim of holistic segmentation is
to identify and separate objects of unseen unknown categories into instances,
without any prior knowledge about them, while performing panoptic segmentation
of known classes. We tackle this new problem with U3HS, which finds unknowns as
highly uncertain regions, and clusters their corresponding instance-aware
embeddings into individual objects. By doing so, for the first time in panoptic
segmentation with unknown objects, our U3HS is not trained with unknown
categories, reducing assumptions and leaving the settings as unconstrained as
in real-life scenarios. Extensive experiments on publicly available data from

perform. Challenge exists especially in handling touching, overlapping and
clustered chromosomes in metaphase images, which if not segmented properly
would result in wrong classification. We propose a method to automate the
process of detection and segmentation of chromosomes from a given metaphase
image, and in using them to classify through a Deep CNN architecture to know
the chromosome type. We have used two methods to handle the separation of
overlapping chromosomes found in metaphases - one method involving watershed
algorithm followed by autoencoders and the other a method purely based on
watershed algorithm. These methods involve a combination of automation and very
minimal manual effort to perform the segmentation, which produces the output.
The manual effort ensures that human intuition is taken into consideration,
especially in handling touching, overlapping and cluster chromosomes. Upon
segmentation, individual chromosome images are then classified into their
respective classes with 95.75\% accuracy using a Deep CNN model. Further, we
impart a distribution strategy to classify these chromosomes from the given
output (which typically could consist of 46 individual images in a normal
scenario for human beings) into its individual classes with an accuracy of
98\%. Our study helps conclude that pure manual effort involved in chromosome

orbits, along with the vortensity gradient in the background disk, is important
for determining orbital migration rate and direction of low-mass planets.
Previous two-dimensional studies predicted that the dynamical corotation torque
is positive, decelerating the inward planet migration. In contrast, recent
three-dimensional studies have shown that buoyancy resonance makes the
dynamical corotation torque negative, accelerating the inward migration. In
this paper, we study the dependence of the dynamical corotation torque on the
thermal transport using three-dimensional simulations. We first show that our
results are consistent with previous three-dimensional studies when the disk is
fully adiabatic. In more realistic radiative disks, however, radiative
diffusion suppresses the buoyancy resonance significantly, especially at
high-altitude regions, and yields a positive dynamical corotation torque. This
alleviates the issue of a rapid migration caused by the negative dynamical
corotation torque in the adiabatic disks. Our results suggest that radiative
diffusion together with stellar irradiation and accretion heating is needed to
accurately describe the migration of low-mass planets.

and generalization. One of the primary reasons is their limited ability to
extract relevant information from forgery videos, especially in the presence of
various artifacts such as spatial, frequency, temporal, and landmark
mismatches. Current detectors rely on pixel-level features that are easily
affected by unknown disturbances or facial landmarks that do not provide
sufficient information. Furthermore, most detectors cannot utilize information
from multiple domains for detection, leading to limited effectiveness in
identifying deepfake videos. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
framework, namely Multimodal Graph Learning (MGL) that leverages information
from multiple modalities using two GNNs and several multimodal fusion modules.
At the frame level, we employ a bi-directional cross-modal transformer and an
adaptive gating mechanism to combine the features from the spatial and
frequency domains with the geometric-enhanced landmark features captured by a
GNN. At the video level, we use a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to represent
each frame in a video as a node in a graph and encode temporal information into
the edges of the graph to extract temporal inconsistency between frames. Our
proposed method aims to effectively identify and utilize distinguishing
features for deepfake detection. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method
through extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks and demonstrate that
our method outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors in terms of
generalization ability and robustness against unknown disturbances.

as $x\to \pm\infty$. The signature of unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is the
existence of reflectionless propagating states at discrete real energies up to
arbitrarily high energy. In the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase, there are no such
solutions. In addition, there exists an intermediate mixed phase, where
reflectionless states exist at low energy but disappear at a fixed finite
energy, independent of termination length. In the mixed phase exceptional

occlusions. This paper presents a novel self-supervised visual servoing method
for wide baseline images which does not require 3D ground truth supervision.
Existing approaches that regress absolute camera pose with respect to an object
require 3D ground truth data of the object in the forms of 3D bounding boxes or
meshes. We learn a coherent visual representation by leveraging a geometric
property called 3D equivariance-the representation is transformed in a
predictable way as a function of 3D transformation. To ensure that the
feature-space is faithful to the underlying geodesic space, a geodesic
preserving constraint is applied in conjunction with the equivariance. We
design a Siamese network that can effectively enforce these two geometric
properties without requiring 3D supervision. With the learned model, the
relative transformation can be inferred simply by following the gradient in the
learned space and used as feedback for closed-loop visual servoing. Our method
is evaluated on objects from the YCB dataset, showing meaningful outperformance
on a visual servoing task, or object alignment task with respect to
state-of-the-art approaches that use 3D supervision. Ours yields more than 35%
average distance error reduction and more than 90% success rate with 3cm error

motion of six sources. We find that G32.7193$-$0.6477 is a Galactic source and
are able to constrain the parallax of this source with a 3$\sigma$
significance. We found three strong Galactic candidates, G32.5898$-$0.4468,
G29.1075$-$0.1546, and G31.1494$-$0.1727, based purely on their proper motions,
and suggest that G29.1075$-$0.1546, is also likely Galactic. We detected two
resolved targets for multiple epochs (G30.1038+0.3984 and G29.7161$-$0.3178).
We find six targets are only detected in one epoch and have an extended
structure. We cross-match our VLBA detections with the currently available
optical, infrared and X-ray surveys, and did not find any potential matches. We
did not detect 19 targets in any VLBA epochs and suggest that this could be due
to limited $uv$-coverage, drastic radio variability or faint, extended nature
of the sources.

reduction environment which retains the high level of flexibility and accuracy
typical of the standard ""by-hand"" reduction methods but is characterized by a
significantly higher level of efficiency. This is obtained by exploiting three
main concepts: $i)$ the instrument model: at the core of the data reduction is
an analytic description of the main calibration relations (e.g. spectra
location and wavelength calibration) that can be easily checked and adjusted on
data using a graphical tool; $ii)$ a built-in data organizer that classifies
the data, together with a graphical interface that helps in providing the
recipes with the correct input; $iii)$ the design and flexibility of the
reduction recipes: the number of tasks required to perform a complete reduction
is minimized, while preserving the possibility of verifying the accuracy of the
main stages of data-reduction process with provided tools. The current version
of SIPGI manages data from the MODS and LUCI spectrographs mounted at the Large
Binocular Telescope, and it is our plan to extend SIPGI to support other
through-slit spectrographs. Meanwhile, to allow using the same approach based
on the instrument model with other instruments, we have developed SpectraPy, a
spectrograph independent Python library working on through-slit spectra. In its
current version, SpectraPy produces two-dimensional wavelength calibrated
spectra corrected by instrument distortions. The current release of SIPGI and

reinterpreted discrete fracture model (RDFM) [Xu & Yang, 2021 submitted] that
use Dirac-$\delta$ functions to model both conductive and blocking fractures.
Due to the use of Dirac-$\delta$ function approach for the fractures, our
numerical scheme naturally allows for unfitted meshes with respect to the
fractures, which is the major novelty of the proposed scheme. Moreover, the
scheme is locally mass conservative and is relatively easy to implement
comparing with existing work on the subject. In particular, our scheme is a
simple modification of an existing regular Darcy flow HDG solver by adding the
following two components: (i) locate the co-dimension one fractures in the
background mesh and adding the appropriate surface integrals associated with
these fractures into the stiffness matrix, (ii) adjust the penalty parameters
on cells cut through conductive and blocking fractures (fractured cells).
  Despite the simplicity of the proposed scheme, it performs extremely well for
various benchmark test cases in both two- and three-dimensions. This is the
first time that a truly unfitted finite element scheme been applied to complex

transformations by reading their input in a single left-to-right pass while
maintaining fragments of potential outputs in a finite set of string variables.
These variables get updated on transitions of the transducer where they can be
reassigned to concatenations of variables and symbols. An SST is called
\emph{copyless} if every update is such that no variable gets copied to more
than once. Copyless SSTs capture Courcelle's monadic second-order definable
graph transformations (MSOT) when restricted to string-to-string rewritings.
The extension of copyless SSTs with nondeterminism is also known to be
equivalent to the nondeterministic variant of MSOTs.
  MSOTs, both deterministic and nondeterministic, are closed under composition.
Given the equivalence of MSOT and copyless SSTs, it is easy to see that
copyless SSTs are also closed under composition. The original proofs of this
fact, however, were based on a direct construction to produce a composite
copyless SST from two given copyless SSTs. A counterexample discovered by Joost
Englefriet showed that this construction may produce copyful transducers. We
revisit the original composition constructions for both deterministic and
nondeterministic SSTs and show that, although they can introduce copyful
updates, the resulting copyful behavior they exhibit is superficial and is
characterized by a property we call ""diamond-free"": two copies of the variables
are never merged. To recover a modified version of the original construction,
we provide a method for producing an equivalent copyless NSST from any
diamond-free copyful NSST.

Modelling of this singular structure has settled on the Detweiler-Whiting
singular field as the gold standard. As a solution to the governing wave
equation itself, on removal, it leaves a smooth regular field that is a
solution to the homogeneous wave equation, much like its well established flat
spacetime counterpart. The mode-sum method enables subtraction of this
singularity mode by mode via a spherical harmonic decomposition. The more modes
one has, the faster the convergence in the $\ell$-sum, making these expressions
highly beneficial, especially considering the heavy computational burden of
waveform production. Until recently, only the two leading orders were known for

consumption of their full stack to achieve a target performance becomes
crucial. It mandates a synergy of fundamental physics and engineering: the
former for the microscopic aspects of computing performance, and the latter for
the macroscopic resource consumption. With this aim in mind, we propose a
methodology dubbed Metric-Noise-Resource (MNR) able to quantify and optimize
all aspects of the full-stack quantum computer, bringing together concepts from
quantum physics (e.g., noise on the qubits), quantum information (e.g.,
computing architecture and type of error correction), and enabling technologies
(e.g., cryogenics, control electronics, and wiring). This holistic approach
allows us to define and study resource efficiencies as ratios between
performance and resource cost. As a proof of concept, we use MNR to minimize
the power consumption of a full-stack quantum computer, performing noisy or
fault-tolerant computing with a target performance for the task of interest.
Comparing this with a classical processor performing the same task, we identify
a quantum energy advantage in regimes of parameters distinct from the commonly
considered quantum computational advantage. This provides a previously
overlooked practical argument for building quantum computers. While our
illustration uses highly idealized parameters inspired by superconducting
qubits with concatenated error correction, our methodology is universal -- it
applies to other qubits and error-correcting codes -- and provides
experimenters with guidelines to build energy-efficient quantum processors. In
some regimes of high energy consumption, it can reduce this consumption by
orders of magnitudes. Overall, our methodology lays the theoretical foundation
for resource-efficient quantum technologies.

modern astrophysics. The Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB), sourced by the
emission from all dusty star-forming galaxies since the epoch of reionisation,
is a complementary probe to study the star formation history, as well as an
important extragalactic foreground for studies of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB). Understanding the physics of the CIB is therefore of high
importance for both cosmology and galaxy formation studies. In this paper, we
make high signal-to-noise measurements of the cross-correlation between maps of
the CIB from the Planck experiment, and cosmic shear measurements from the Dark
Energy Survey and Kilo-Degree Survey. Cosmic shear, sourced mainly by the weak
gravitational lensing of photons emitted by background galaxies, is a direct
tracer of the matter distribution, and thus we can use its cross-correlation
with the CIB to directly test our understanding of the link between the star
formation rate (SFR) density and the matter density. We use our measurements to
place constraints on a halo-based model of the SFR that parametrises the
efficiency with which gas is transformed into stars as a function of halo mass
and redshift. These constraints are enhanced by combining our data with
model-independent measurements of the bias-weighted SFR density extracted from
the tomographic cross-correlation of galaxies and the CIB. We are able to place
constraints on the peak efficiency at low redshifts,
$\eta=0.445^{+0.055}_{-0.11}$, and on the halo mass at which this peak
efficiency is achieved today $\log_{10}(M_1/M_\odot) = 12.17\pm0.25$. Our
constraints are in excellent agreement with direct measurements of the SFR
density, as well as other CIB-based studies.

parameters and group memberships. Then we apply the fitted model to the testing
dataset and then the group number is estimated by minimizing certain loss
function values on the testing dataset. We design the loss functions for panel
data models either with or without fixed effects. The proposed method has two
advantages. First, the method is totally data-driven thus no further tuning
parameters are involved. Second, the method can be flexibly applied to a wide

consistency by taking advantage of the optimization property of the estimation

wave (GW) detectors. Although stationary Gaussian noise is uncorrelated in
frequencies, we show that there is an important correlation in time when
looking at the matched filter signal to noise ratio (SNR) of a template, with a
typical autocorrelation time that depends on the template and the shape of the
noise power spectral density (PSD). Taking this correlation into account, we
compute from first principles the false alarm rate (FAR) of a template in
Gaussian noise, defined as the number of occurrences per unit time that the
template's matched filter SNR goes over a threshold $\rho$. We find that the
Gaussian FAR can be well approximated by the usual expression for uncorrelated
noise, if we replace the sampling rate by an effective sampling rate that
depends on the parameters of the template, the noise PSD and the threshold
$\rho$. This results in a minimum SNR threshold that has to be demanded to a
given GW trigger, if we want to keep events generated from Gaussian noise below
a certain FAR. We extend the formalism to multiple detectors and to the
analysis of GW events. We apply our method to the GW candidates added in the
GWTC-3 catalog, and discuss the possibility that GW200308\_173609 and
GW200322\_091133 could be generated by Gaussian noise fluctuations.

galaxy formation. We find that LMC analogues at $z=2$ evolve until the present
day along three distinct pathways: (1) those that are destroyed in Milky
Way-mass hosts; (2) those that are themselves the main progenitors of Milky
Way-mass galaxies; and (3) those that survive until $z=0$, with stellar mass
$\sim$1.0 dex lower than typical Milky Ways. We predict that the properties of
these galaxies at $z=2$ (stellar metallicities, sizes, gas content etc.) are
largely indistinguishable, irrespective of which of these pathways is
eventually taken; a survey targeting such galaxies in this redshift range would
struggle to tell apart a 'destroyed' stellar halo progenitor from a 'surviving'
LMC analogue. The only factor that determines the eventual fate of these
galaxies is their proximity to a neighbouring Milky Way main progenitor at
$z=2$: while the mean separation to a 'surviving' galaxy is around 7 Mpc, it is
only 670 kpc to a 'destroyed' galaxy. This suggests that old stellar
populations in the Milky Way may share intrinsic (i.e. non-dynamical)

However, the defect-dipole tends to be considered the undesired to deteriorate

the ferroelectric and the pinched states by exploiting a new substrate of cubic
perovskite, BaZrO$_{3}$, which boosts square-tensile-strain to BaTiO$_{3}$ and
promotes four-variants in-plane spontaneous polarization with oxygen vacancy
creation. First-principles calculations propose a complex of an oxygen vacancy
and two Ti$^{3+}$ ions coins a charge-neutral defect-dipole. Cooperative
control of the defect-dipole and the spontaneous polarization reveals ternary
in-plane polar states characterized by biased/pinched hysteresis loops.
Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that three electrically controlled
polar-ordering states lead to switchable and non-volatile dielectric states for
application of non-destructive electro-dielectric memory. This discovery opens
a new route to develop functional materials via manipulating defect-dipoles and
offers a novel platform to advance heteroepitaxy beyond the prevalent

on the star-formation rate at z=2. We detect kpc-scale filaments directly
connected to galaxies by applying the DisPerSE filament finder to the DM
density around 2942 central galaxies ($M_* > 10^{8}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot / h$) of
the TNG50-1 simulation. Our results demonstrate that galaxy connectivity spans
a broad range (from 0 to 9), with more than half of the galaxies connected to
two or three streams. We examine a variety of factors that could influence the
connectivity finding out that it increases with mass, decreases with local
density for low mass galaxies, and does not depend on local environment,
estimated by the Delaunay tessellation, for high mass galaxies. We further
classify galaxies according to their location in different cosmic web
environments, and we highlight the influence of the large-scale structure on
the number of connected streams. Our results reflect the different strengths of
the cosmic tides, which can prevent the formation of coherent streams feeding
the galaxies, or even disconnect the galaxy from its local web. Finally, we
show that, at fixed local density, the star-formation rate (SFR) of low mass
galaxies is up to $5.9\sigma$ enhanced due to connectivity. This SFR boost is
even more significant ($6.3\sigma$) for galaxies embedded in cosmic filaments,
where the available matter reservoirs are large. A milder impact is found for
high mass galaxies, hinting at different relative efficiencies of matter inflow
via small-scale streams in galaxies of different masses.

physically motivated criteria to define the edges of galaxies. Based on the gas
density threshold required for star formation, we define the edge of a galaxy
as the outermost radial location associated with a significant drop in either
past or ongoing in-situ star formation. We explore $\sim$1000 low-inclination
galaxies with a wide range in morphology (dwarfs to ellipticals) and stellar
mass ($10^7 M_{\odot} < M_{\star} < 10^{12}M_{\odot}$). The location of the
edges of these galaxies ($R_{\rm edge}$) are visually identified as the
outermost cut-off or truncation in their radial profiles using deep multi-band
optical imaging from the IAC Stripe82 Legacy Project. We find this
characteristic feature at the following mean stellar mass density which varies
with galaxy morphology: $2.9\pm0.10\,M_{\odot}$/pc$^2$ for ellipticals,
$1.1\pm0.04\,M_{\odot}/$pc$^2$ for spirals and $0.6\pm0.03\,M_{\odot}/$pc$^2$

depends on its age (colour) where bluer galaxies have larger $R_{\rm edge}$ at
a fixed stellar mass. The resulting stellar mass--size plane using $R_{\rm
edge}$ as a physically motivated galaxy size measure has a very narrow
intrinsic scatter ($\lesssim 0.06$ dex). These results highlight the importance

altering their evolution in comparison to stars in the interstellar medium.

accretion, fresh gas replenishes hydrogen in the cores of these stars as
quickly as it is burned into helium, reaching a quasi-steady state. Such

AGN disks with helium, and would increase the helium abundance in AGN

fractions, and so undergo more radiation-driven mass-loss. We further find that
embedded stars tend to be less massive in disks with higher helium mass
fractions, and that immortal stars are less common in such disks. Thus, disk
composition can alter the rates of electromagnetic and gravitational wave
transients as well as further chemical enrichment by embedded stars.

population, Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) are themselves a key laboratory in
which to study star formation in extreme low-density environments. In the
second paper of this series, we compare the spatially resolved star formation
activity of 22 HI-selected UDGs and 21 ""normal"" dwarf galaxies within 120 Mpc
to predictions within the pressure-regulated, feedback-modulated (PRFM) theory
of star formation. To do so, we employ a joint SED fitting method that allows
us to estimate star formation rate and stellar mass surface density from
UV-optical imaging. We find that the PRFM framework extends successfully to the
UDG regime - although the UDGs in our sample show unusually low star formation
rate surface densities given their HI content, this low star formation
efficiency can be naturally explained by the diffuse structure of the UDGs. In
fact, when cast in the PRFM framework, the relationship between midplane
pressure and star formation in the UDG sample is in good agreement not only
with the ""normal"" dwarf reference sample, but also with measurements from more
massive galaxies. Our results suggest that despite their low star formation
efficiencies, the HI-rich UDGs need not be forming stars in an exotic manner.
We also find that the UDGs are likely H$_2$-poor compared even to the overall
dwarf population.

subsolar, $0.2<m/\text{M}_\odot<1$, and supersolar mass regimes. A significant
correlation between the MF-slope and the ratio of age to half-mass relaxation

Galactic globular clusters. However, OCs evolve along different tracks in
comparison with the globular clusters, possibly indicating primordial
differences in their initial mass function (IMF). The comparison with Monte

commonly assumed single-power law. We find a break in our synthetic XLF at
luminosity $\sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$, similar to observed XLFs. However, we
find also a general overabundance of XRBs (up to a factor of $\sim$10 for
certain model parameter combinations) driven primarily by XRBs with black hole
accretors. Assumptions about the transient behavior of Be-XRBs, asymmetric
supernova kicks, and common-envelope physics can significantly affect the shape

assumptions regarding the circularization of the orbit at the onset of
Roche-lobe overflow and criteria for the formation of an X-ray emitting

tilt, and finite intervalley scattering, taking into account the momentum
dependence of the scattering processes (both internode and intranode), as well
as charge conservation. We show that strain induced chiral gauge field results
in `strong sign-reversal' of the LMC, which is characterized by the reversal of
orientation of the magnetoconductance parabola with respect to the magnetic
field. On the other hand, external magnetic field results in `strong

galaxy sample compared to strong absorption systems viewed in quasar spectra

examine scaling relations in outflow velocities with galaxy stellar mass and
star formation rate (SFR), finding correlations consistent with a
momentum-driven wind scenario. Our measured outflow velocities are also
comparable to those reported for FIRE-2 and TNG50 cosmological simulations at
similar redshift and galaxy properties. We also consider implications for

when the Higgs decay products are removed. These results highlight the

$0.20<z<0.80$. Using this sample, we measure no change in the ICL's stellar
content (between 50-300\,kpc) over this redshift range in clusters with
log$_{10}(M_{\rm 200m,SZ}$/M$_{\odot})>$14.4. We also measure the stellar mass
- halo mass (SMHM) relation for the BCG+ICL system and find that the slope,
$\beta$, which characterises the dependence of $M_{\rm 200m,SZ}$ on the BCG+ICL
stellar mass, increases with radius. The outskirts are more strongly correlated
with the halo than the core, which supports that the BCG+ICL system follows a
two-phase growth, where recent growth ($z<2$) occurs beyond the BCG's core.
Additionally, we compare our observed SMHM relation results to the IllustrisTNG
300-1 cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and find moderate qualitative
agreement in the amount of diffuse light. However, the SMHM relation's slope is
steeper in TNG300-1 and the intrinsic scatter is lower, likely from the absence
of projection effects in TNG300-1. Additionally, we find that the ICL exhibits
a colour gradient such that the outskirts are bluer than the core. Moreover,
for the lower halo mass clusters (log$_{10}(M_{\rm 200m,SZ}$/M$_{\odot})<$14.59
), we detect a modest change in the colour gradient's slope with lookback time,
which combined with the absence of stellar mass growth may suggest that lower
mass clusters have been involved in growth via tidal stripping more recently
than their higher mass counterparts.

both limitations, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage learning approach
based on our analysis on the likely reasons causing such sensitivity, with the
first stage learning from cross-entropy loss, followed by a second stage
learning from EDL loss. We also re-formulate the EDL loss by replacing ReLU

has been studied for a variety of classical models with the goal of better
understanding the mechanisms behind deep learning. Characterizing the

our understanding of the relationship between overfitting,

characterization of benign overfitting in quantum models. To do this, we derive
the behavior of a classical interpolating Fourier features models for
regression on noisy signals, and show how a class of quantum models exhibits
analogous features, thereby linking the structure of quantum circuits (such as

a beat-cycle between the 199.384-min white dwarf (WD) spin period and the
201.244-min orbital period. This results in changes in the flow of matter onto
the WD. The TESS light curve covers 92% of the beat cycle once and 71% of the
beat cycle twice. The strongest photometric signal, at 197.560-min, is ascribed
to a side-band period. During times of light-curve stability, the photometry
modulates at the spin frequency, supporting our WD spin-period identification.
Both one-pole and two-pole accretion configurations repeat from one beat cycle
to the next with clear and repeatable beat-phase dependent intensity
variations. To explain these, we propose the operation of a magnetic valve at
L1. The magnetic valve modulates the mass-transfer rate, as evidenced by a
factor of 5 variation in orbital-averaged intensity, over the course of the
beat cycle in a repeatable manner. The accretion stream threading distance from
the WD is also modulated at the beat-period, because of the variation of the WD
magnetic field with respect to the stream and because of changes in the mass
transfer rate due to the operation of the magnetic valve. Changes in the
threading distance result in significant shifts in the position of accreting
spots around the beat cycle. As a consequence, only the faintest photometric
minima allow for an accurate ephemeris determination. Three regions on the
white dwarf appear to receive most of the accretion flow, suggestive of a
complex WD magnetic field.

on the Fundamental Plane (FP), defined by the physical properties of the

Stellar Mass (Fundamental) Plane, where surface brightness is replaced by
stellar mass, and investigate their dynamical-to-stellar-mass ratio.
  We confirm earlier results that the Fornax dEs are significantly offset above
the FP defined by massive, hot stellar systems. For the Stellar Mass
(Fundamental) Plane, which shows much lower scatter, we find that young and old
dwarf galaxies lie at about the same distance from the plane, all with
comparable scatter. We introduce the perpendicular deviation of dwarf galaxies
from the Stellar Mass Plane defined by giant early-types as a robust estimate
of their DM fraction, and find that the faintest dwarfs are systematically
offset above the plane, implying that they have a higher dark matter fraction.
This result is confirmed when estimating the dynamical mass of our dEs using a
virial mass estimator, tracing the onset of dark matter domination in low mass
stellar systems.
  We find that the position of our galaxies on the Stellar Mass FP agrees with
the galaxies in the Local Group. This seems to imply that the processes
determining the position of dwarf galaxies on the FP depend on the environment
in the same way, whether the galaxy is situated in the Local Group or in the
Fornax Cluster.

can be intentionally introduced to enhance aesthetics or to satisfy a design

processes such as Piezo Vibration Striking Treatment (PVST). Measures of order
for surfaces have been characterized using statistical, spectral, and geometric
approaches. For nearly hexagonal lattices, topological tools have also been
used to measure the surface order. This paper utilizes tools from Topological
Data Analysis for quantifying the impact centers' pattern in PVST. We compute
measures of order based on optical digital microscope images of surfaces
treated using PVST. These measures are applied to the grid obtained from
estimating the centers of tool impacts, and they quantify the grid's deviations

of the 42 au ring strongly resembles the characteristic horseshoe orbit
produced in planet--disk interaction models, where the clump and the arc trace
dust accumulation around Lagrangian points $L_{4}$ and $L_{5}$, respectively.
The shape of the 42 au ring, dust trapping in the outer adjacent ring, and the
coincidence of the horseshoe ring location with a gap in near-IR scattered
light, are all consistent with the scenario of planet sculpting, with the
planet likely having a mass between those of Neptune and Saturn. We do not
detect point-like emission associated with a CPD around the putative planet
location ($0.''27$ in projected separation from the central star at a position
angle of $\sim$60\degr), with upper limits of 70 and 33 $\mu$Jy at 0.88 and 1.3
mm, respectively, corresponding to dust mass upper limits of 0.02--0.03
$M_{\oplus}$.

establish a multi-tracer time-line of star formation in the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC), focusing on the lifecycle of molecular clouds. We use a
statistical method to determine a molecular cloud lifetime in the LMC of
$t_{\text{CO}}=11.8^{+2.7}_{-2.2}$ Myr. This short time-scale is similar to the
cloud dynamical time, and suggests that molecular clouds in the LMC are largely
decoupled from the effects of galactic dynamics and have lifetimes set by
internal processes. This provides a clear contrast to atomic clouds in the LMC,
of which the lifetimes are correlated with galactic dynamical time-scales. We
additionally derive the time-scale for which molecular clouds and HII regions
co-exist as $t_{\text{fb}}=1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ Myr, implying an average feedback
front expansion velocity of 12 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with expansion
velocities of HII regions in the LMC observed directly using optical
spectroscopy. Taken together, these results imply that the molecular cloud
lifecycle in the LMC proceeds rapidly and is regulated by internal dynamics and
stellar feedback. We conclude by discussing our measurements in the context of
previous work in the literature, which reported considerably longer lifetimes
for molecular clouds in the LMC, and find that these previous findings resulted
from a subjective choice in timeline calibration that is avoided by our

sufficient conditions for the memory of the neural network to decay with the

emerge from the interaction of many simple parts. Understanding the building
principles of these emergent phenomena in nature requires assessing natural
complex systems experimentally. However, despite the development of large-scale
data-acquisition techniques, experimental observations are often limited to a
tiny fraction of the system. This spatial subsampling is particularly severe in
neuroscience, where only a tiny fraction of millions or even billions of
neurons can be individually recorded. Spatial subsampling may lead to
significant systematic biases when inferring the collective properties of the
entire system naively from a subsampled part. To overcome such biases, powerful
mathematical tools have been developed in the past. In this perspective, we
overview some issues arising from subsampling and review recently developed
approaches to tackle the subsampling problem. These approaches enable one to
assess, e.g., graph structures, collective dynamics of animals, neural network
activity, or the spread of disease correctly from observing only a tiny
fraction of the system. However, our current approaches are still far from
having solved the subsampling problem in general, and hence we conclude by
outlining what we believe are the main open challenges. Solving these
challenges alongside the development of large-scale recording techniques will
enable further fundamental insights into the working of complex and living

complementarity, non-commutativity, uncertainty, nonlocality - derive from the
algebraic structure of Hermitian operators acting on the wavefunction in
complex Hilbert space. Because of this, the wavefunction cannot be shown to
describe an ensemble of deterministic states where uncertainty simply reflects
a lack of knowledge about which ensemble member describes reality. This has led
to endless debates about the ontology of quantum mechanics.
  Here we derive these same quantum properties from number theoretic attributes
of trigonometric functions applied to an explicitly ensemble-based
representation of discretised complex Hilbert states. To avoid fine-tuning, the
metric on state space must be $p$-adic rather than Euclidean where $1/p$
determines the fineness of the discretisation. This hints at both the existence
of an underpinning fractal state-space geometry onto which states of the world
are constrained. In this model, violation of Bell inequalities is a
manifestation of this geometric constraint and does not imply a breakdown of
local space-time causality.
  Because the discretised wavefunction describes an ensemble of states, there
is no collapse of the wavefunction. Instead measurement describes a nonlinear
clustering of state-space trajectories on the state-space geometry. In this
model, systems with mass greater than the Planck mass will not exhibit quantum
properties and instead behave classically. The geometric constraint suggests
that the exponential increase in the size of state space with qubit number may
break down with qubit numbers as small as a few hundred. Quantum mechanics is
itself a singular limit of this number-theoretic model at $p=\infty$. A
modification of general relativity, consistent with this discretised model of
quantum physics, is proposed.

diverting users' attention from whether to get the COVID-19 vaccine or inducing
the public to choose a presidential candidate. The government's constant

access control (FGAC) policies when executing SQL queries. More concretely, we
have defined a function SecQuery() that, given an FGAC policy S and a SQL
select-statement q, generates a SQL stored-procedure SecQuery(S, q), such that:
if a user u with role r is authorised, according to S, to execute q based on
the current state of the database, then calling SecQuery(S, q)(u, r) returns
the same result as when u executes q; otherwise, if the user u is not
authorised, according to S, to execute q based on the current state of the

executing the query q takes less time than calling the corresponding
stored-procedure SecQuery(S, q). Here we propose a model-based methodology for
optimising the stored-procedures generated by the function SecQuery(). The idea
is to eliminate authorisation checks in the body of the stored-procedures
generated by SecQuery(), when they can be proved to be unnecessary. Based on
our previous mapping from the Object Constraint Language (OCL) to many-sorted
first-order logic, we can attempt to prove that authorisation checks are

energy efficiency of bulk bitwise operations are bottlenecked by data movement

processing data inside NAND flash chips) has a high potential to accelerate
bulk bitwise operations by fundamentally reducing data movement through the
entire memory hierarchy. We identify two key limitations of the
state-of-the-art in-flash processing technique for bulk bitwise operations; (i)
it falls short of maximally exploiting the bit-level parallelism of bulk
bitwise operations; (ii) it is unreliable because it does not consider the
highly error-prone nature of NAND flash memory. We propose Flash-Cosmos (Flash
Computation with One-Shot Multi-Operand Sensing), a new in-flash processing
technique that significantly increases the performance and energy efficiency of
bulk bitwise operations while providing high reliability. Flash-Cosmos
introduces two key mechanisms that can be easily supported in modern NAND flash

on a large number of operands with a single sensing operation, and (ii)
Enhanced SLC-mode Programming (ESP), which enables reliable computation inside
NAND flash memory. We demonstrate the feasibility of performing bulk bitwise
operations with high reliability in Flash-Cosmos by testing 160 real 3D NAND
flash chips. Our evaluation shows that Flash-Cosmos improves average
performance and energy efficiency by 3.5x/32x and 3.3x/95x, respectively, over

differentially flat systems, where intermediate results can be stored and
reused for further tasks, such as replanning. The proposed approach is based on
the informed optimal rapidly exploring random tree algorithm (informed RRT*),
which is utilized to build trajectory trees that are reused for replanning when
the start and/or target states change. In contrast to state-of-the-art
approaches, the proposed motion planning algorithm incorporates a linear
quadratic minimum time (LQTM) local planner. Thus, dynamic properties such as
time optimality and the smoothness of the trajectory are directly considered in
the proposed algorithm. Moreover, by integrating the branch-and-bound method to
perform the pruning process on the trajectory tree, the proposed algorithm can
eliminate points in the tree that do not contribute to finding better
solutions. This helps to curb memory consumption and reduce the computational
complexity during motion (re)planning. Simulation results for a validated
mathematical model of a 3D gantry crane show the feasibility of the proposed

repeatedly takeover a common resource. The resource is modeled as a discrete
time dynamical system over which a player can gain control after spending a
state-dependent amount of energy at each time step. We use a FlipIT-inspired
deterministic model that decides which player is in control at every time step.
A player's policy is the probability with which the player should spend energy
to gain control at each time step. Our main results are three-fold. First, we
present analytic expressions for the cost-to-go as a function of the hybrid
state of the system, i.e., the physical state of the dynamical system and the
binary \texttt{FlipDyn} state for any general system with arbitrary costs.
These expressions are exact when the physical state is also discrete and has
finite cardinality. Second, for a continuous physical state with linear
dynamics and quadratic costs, we derive expressions for Nash equilibrium (NE).
For scalar physical states, we show that the NE depends only on the parameters
of the value function and costs, and is independent of the state. Third, we
derive an approximate value function for higher dimensional linear systems with
quadratic costs. Finally, we illustrate our results through a numerical study
on the problem of controlling a linear system in a given environment in the

aggregated over multiple data owners. Although aggregation by itself does not
provably offer privacy protection, prior work showed that it may suffice if the
batch size is sufficiently large. In this paper, we propose the Cocktail Party
Attack (CPA) that, contrary to prior belief, is able to recover the private

the crucial insight that aggregate gradients from a fully connected layer is a

a blind source separation (BSS) problem (informally called the cocktail party

overcome the challenges of sequentially deciding which areas of the environment

meta-level decision making framework to balance the tradeoffs associated with
local and global exploration. Meta-level decision making builds upon classical
hierarchical coverage planners by switching between local and global policies
with the overall objective of selecting the policy that is most likely to
maximize reward in a stochastic environment. We use information about the
environment history, traversability risk, and kinodynamic constraints to reason
about the probability of successful policy execution to switch between local

residuals and their host-galaxy masses (the ""mass step"") may bias cosmological
parameter measurements. To better understand the mass step, we develop a SALT3
light-curve model for SN cosmology that uses the host-galaxy masses of 296
low-redshift SNe Ia to derive a spectral-energy distribution--host-galaxy mass
relationship. The resulting model has larger Ca II H&K, Ca II near-infrared
triplet, and Si II equivalent widths for SNe in low-mass host galaxies at
2.2-2.7$\sigma$ significance; this indicates higher explosion energies per unit
mass in low-mass-hosted SNe. The model has phase-dependent changes in SN Ia
colors as a function of host mass, indicating intrinsic differences in mean
broadband light curves. Although the model provides a better fit to the SN data
overall, it does not substantially reduce data--model residuals for a typical
light curve in our sample nor does it significantly reduce Hubble residual
dispersion. This is because we find that previous SALT models parameterized
most host-galaxy dependencies with their first principal component, although
they failed to model some significant spectral variations. Our new model is
luminosity and cosmology independent, and applying it to data reduces the mass
step by $0.021\pm0.002$ mag (uncertainty accounts for correlated data sets);
these results indicate that $\sim$35% of the mass step can be attributed to
luminosity-independent effects. This SALT model version could be trained using
alternative host-galaxy properties and at different redshifts, and therefore
will be a tool for understanding redshift-dependent correlations between SNe Ia
and their host properties as well as their impact on cosmological parameter
measurements.

probed uncertainties in the nucleosynthesis of the oldest intermediate-mass
stars during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. We analysed the evolution
of models from their main sequence, through the thermally pulsing AGB (TP-AGB),
to the latest stages of their evolution, using the Monash-Mount Stromlo stellar
evolution code MONSTAR. The results were post-processed with the code MONSOON,
which allowed for the determination of the nucleosynthetic yields of 77 species
up to 62Ni. As reported in former works, we identified proton ingestion
episodes (PIEs) in our lowest-mass lowest-Z models. Models of Z=1e-10 and
Z=1e-8 in a narrow initial mass range around 5 Msun experience the cessation of
thermal pulses, and their final fates as type-I1/2 supernovae cannot be
discarded. All the models of initial mass of about 6-7 Msun experience a
corrosive second dredge-up and undergo significant metal enrichment in their
envelopes. This allows them to develop a solar-like TP-AGB or TP-super-AGB,
ultimately becoming white dwarfs. Except for those undergoing the cessation of
thermal pulses, all of our models show the nucleosynthetic signatures of both
efficient third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning, with the activation of the
NeNa cycle and the MgAlSi chains. This leads to the creation of vast amounts of
CNO, with typical [N/Fe] > 4), and the characteristic abundance signature
[N/Fe] > [C/Fe] > [O/Fe]. Due to differences in input physics (mostly related
to convection and convective boundaries), our nucleosynthetic yields present
dramatic differences with respect to recent results existing in the literature
for intermediate-mass models of similar metallicities.

Chip-based OPAs typically require long waveguides that occupy a large

lasers. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a
microresonator-assisted regenerative OPA that benefits from the large
nonlinearity enhancement of microresonators and yields a high gain in a small

show that the gain spectrum can be engineered to cover telecom channels
inaccessible with Er-based amplifiers. We further demonstrate the amplification
of Kerr-soliton comb lines and the preservation of their phase properties.
Additionally, we demonstrate amplification by injection locking of
optical-parametric oscillators, which corresponds to a regenerative amplifier
pumped above the oscillation threshold. Novel dispersion engineering techniques
such as coupled cavities and higher-order-dispersion phase matching can further
extend the tunability and spectral coverage of our amplification schemes. The
combination of high gain, small footprint, low pump power, and flexible

For single beam targets, we can even turn off the metrology laser for the
maximum SNR on the detector. These changes lead to an SNR improvement of over a
factor of two averaged over the whole spectrum and up to a factor of eight in
the part of the spectrum currently dominated by laser noise.

(LEO) objects is set to TRIPLE in two years. The growth in LEO objects directly
increases the probability of unintentional collisions between objects due to
accumulating space debris. Effective space traffic management needs accurate
knowledge of the variability in upper atmosphere densities. Data assimilative
modeling, where physics-based models are informed by measurements, supplies the
best capability today for specifying and predicting space weather. The
foundation for this modeling comes from the SET High Accuracy Satellite Drag
Model (HASDM) density database. We report on studies to understand the
variabilities in HASDM. We identify two thermospheric features from the SET
HASDM density database. First, we have confirmed that the time scale is very
rapid (1-hour) for molecular conduction above 200 km to transfer energy
vertically in the thermosphere. This results couples with a longer timescale
for conduction in the 100-200 km region where it takes up to 2 days for energy
to transition across that region via molecular conduction. We now have an
excellent picture of the timescales of energy change throughout the
thermosphere. Second, the SET HASDM density data display a common range of
variability despite the level of daily averaged geomagnetic activity as
represented by Ap. During higher levels of daily averaged geomagnetic activity,
the density mean and median values increase at all altitude levels. However,
the relative range of variability is consistent from one daily average of Ap to
the next. The reason is likely to be that the underlying pre-storm density of
the thermosphere is determined by the solar EUV and FUV irradiances that create
a thermal foundation of the upper atmosphere. The daily averaged geomagnetic
activity is a perturbation upon that foundation.

human expertise is usually outperformed by data-driven approaches. Here we test
if we can improve causal discovery in a data-driven way. We take a perturbable
system with a large number of causal components (transistors), the MOS 6502

procedure represented as a neural network. We find that this procedure far
outperforms human-designed causal discovery procedures, such as Mutual

points to the beam being produced at higher altitudes by incident relativistic

been inferred by ground observatory, aircraft air, and satellite space

sources associated with geomagnetic substorms and radiation belt coupling
although these enhanced radiation events seem to frequently occur even during
very minor geomagnetic disturbed conditions. These events show a dynamic and
variable radiation environment at aircraft altitudes in a narrow magnetic
latitude band (43-67 N, S; L-shells between 2 and 7). Observations are of dose
rate enhancements that are statistically significant above the galactic cosmic

geomagnetic conditions and at L-shell 4, the effective dose rate can be 32
percent higher than from GCRs alone. For the events themselves the mean
effective dose rate is nearly double that for the background GCR level. The

sometimes missing. In this paper, the Safe Route Mapping (SRM) model, a
methodology for developing dynamic risk heat maps of roadways, is extended to
consider driver behaviors when making predictions. An Android App is designed
to gather drivers' information and upload it to a server. On the server, facial
recognition extracts drivers' data, such as facial landmarks, gaze directions,
and emotions. The driver's drowsiness and distraction are detected, and driving
performance is evaluated. Meanwhile, dynamic traffic information is captured by
a roadside camera and uploaded to the same server. A
longitudinal-scanline-based arterial traffic video analytics is applied to
recognize vehicles from the video to build speed and trajectory profiles. Based
on these data, a LightGBM model is introduced to predict conflict indices for
drivers in the next one or two seconds. Then, multiple data sources, including
historical crash counts and predicted traffic conflict indicators, are combined
using a Fuzzy logic model to calculate risk scores for road segments. The
proposed SRM model is illustrated using data collected from an actual traffic
intersection and a driving simulation platform. The prediction results show
that the model is accurate, and the added driver behavior features will improve
the model's performance. Finally, risk heat maps are generated for
visualization purposes. The authorities can use the dynamic heat map to
designate safe corridors and dispatch law enforcement and drivers for early
warning and trip planning.

morphologies, combined with a Beta model of the hot intracluster medium, to
constrain the real distances of the galaxies to the cluster center, and we use
the chance alignment of NGC 3314b behind NGC 3314a to break the degeneracy

person manipulating the object. We canonicalize the task of articulated 3D
human-object interaction reconstruction from RGB video, and carry out a
systematic benchmark of five families of methods for this task: 3D plane

and free-form mesh fitting. Our experiments show that all methods struggle to
obtain high accuracy results even when provided ground truth information about

challenges to distribution system operation, e.g., power quality issues. To
overcome these challenges and enhance system operation, it is critical to
effectively utilize all available resources and accurately characterize
unbalanced distribution networks in operational tools. This paper proposes a
convex second-order-cone programming (SOCP)-based AC optimal power flow (ACOPF)
model for three-phase unbalanced distribution net-works, including smart
inverters and Volt-VAr controller (VVC) devices. Reactive power-voltage (Q-V)
characteristics of smart inverters of solar photovoltaic (PV) units are also
modeled. More-over, the settings of Q-V characteristics of VVC are co-optimized
within the proposed ACOPF, considering the allowable range of the IEEE
1547-2018 standard. Furthermore, dynamic analyses are conducted to verify the
stability of optimal settings of VVC. The proposed models are tested on an
actual 1747-node primary distribution feeder in Arizona. The results illustrate
the effective-ness of the proposed ACOPF for unbalanced systems in provid-ing a
global optimal solution while capturing the non-linearity and non-convexity of
ACOPF. By co-optimizing settings, system operation is improved due to the
flexibility of adjusting reactive power output from PV units with VVC. The
time-domain simu-lations show that the optimal settings result in a stable

to encode relative position on the keyboard to the prior note instead, we can
achieve much better performance. Additionally, we reassess the use of raw

The bubble can be nucleated in a meta-stable pure AdS${}_5$ spacetime, but it

that the pure AdS${}_5$ background is an idealized situation, and in realistic
situations, non-linear perturbations in AdS may lead to the formation of black

confident candidate of a BH binary. The primary (visible) star in this system,
Gaia DR3 5870569352746779008, is a red giant branch whose mass is quite
uncertain. Fortunately, albeit the uncertainty of the primary's mass, we can
estimate the mass of the secondary (dark) object in this system to be $>5.68$
$M_\odot$ with a probability of $99$ \%, based on the orbital parameters. The
mass of the secondary object is much larger than the maximum neutron star mass
($\sim 2.0$ $M_\odot$), which indicates that the secondary object is likely a
BH. We argue that, if this dark object is not a BH, this system must be a more
exotic system, in which the primary red giant branch star orbits around a
quadruple star system (or a higher-order multiple star system) whose total mass
is more than $5.68$ $M_\odot$. If this is a genuine BH binary, this has the
longest period ($1352.22 \pm 45.81$ days) among discovered so far. As our
conclusion entirely relies on the Gaia DR3 data, independent confirmation with
follow-up observations (e.g. long-term spectra) is desired.

potentially learn which protocol is being performed by gathering knowledge of

attention has been given to the hierarchies within such information at
different timestamps. Given that TKG is a sequence of knowledge graphs based on
time, the chronology in the sequence derives hierarchies between the graphs.
Furthermore, each knowledge graph has its hierarchical level which may differ
from one another. To address these hierarchical characteristics in TKG, we
propose HyperVC, which utilizes hyperbolic space that better encodes the
hierarchies than Euclidean space. The chronological hierarchies between
knowledge graphs at different timestamps are represented by embedding the
knowledge graphs as vectors in a common hyperbolic space. Additionally, diverse
hierarchical levels of knowledge graphs are represented by adjusting the
curvatures of hyperbolic embeddings of their entities and relations.
Experiments on four benchmark datasets show substantial improvements,

because of biological processes. This work introduces an input delay
compensation with state-feedback control law for axon elongation by regulating
tubulin concentration. Axon growth dynamics with input delay is modeled as
coupled parabolic diffusion-reaction-advection Partial Differential Equations

within the core. While Fe does not form binary compounds or a bulk alloy with
Au under ambient conditions, it may do so at the elevated pressures found in
the Earth's interior. Here, using density-functional methods, we investigated
the possibility of identifying stable, binary Fe-Au compounds at pressures up
to 210 GPa. We found three such Fe-Au compounds, which are stabilized by
pressure and notable electron transfer, including an orthorhombic AuFe$_4$
phase that is ferromagnetic in nature with Au possessing a significant magnetic
moment. While our results suggest that thermal convection due to the
conductivities and the heat flux from the Fe-Au compounds could be an energy
source to power the Earth's geodynamo, they also point towards changes in Au's
chemical properties, as it can exist as either an anion or cation under
pressure. In addition, the sound velocity and the density predicted for the
various Fe-Au compounds suggest that they could shed light on the composition
of the core-mantle boundary and the Earth's core, while demonstrating how the
presence of trace amounts of Au could influence agreement with seismic data.

visual models to understand videos comprehensively. However, few studies
directly employ the graph model to reason about the video. The graph model
provides the benefits of fewer parameters, low computational cost, a large
receptive field, and flexible neighborhood message aggregation. In this paper,
we present a graph-based method named Semantic2Graph, to turn the video action
segmentation and recognition problem into node classification of graphs. To
preserve fine-grained relations in videos, we construct the graph structure of
videos at the frame-level and design three types of edges: temporal, semantic,
and self-loop. We combine visual, structural, and semantic features as node
attributes. Semantic edges are used to model long-term spatio-temporal
relations, while the semantic features are the embedding of the label-text
based on the textual prompt. A Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model is used to
learn multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results show that Semantic2Graph
achieves improvement on GTEA and 50Salads, compared to the state-of-the-art
results. Multiple ablation experiments further confirm the effectiveness of
semantic features in improving model performance, and semantic edges enable
Semantic2Graph to capture long-term dependencies at a low cost.

a $C^{\infty}$ function of two variables as much as possible by using ordinary
blowings up. As a result, we formulate an algorithm to locally express the zero
variety in the ``almost'' normal crossings form, which is close to the normal
crossings form but may include flat functions. As an application, we
investigate analytic continuation of local zeta functions associated with
$C^{\infty}$ functions of two variables. As is well known, the
desingularization theorem of Hironaka implies that the local zeta functions
associated with real analytic functions admit the meromorphic continuation to
the whole complex plane. On the other hand, it is recently observed that the
local zeta function associated with a specific (non-real analytic) $C^{\infty}$
function has a singularity different from the pole. From this observation, the
following questions are naturally raised in the $C^{\infty}$ case: how wide the
meromorphically extendible region can be and what kinds of information
essentially determine this region? This paper shows that this region can be
described in terms of some kind of multiplicity of the zero variety of each
$C^{\infty}$ function. By using our blowings up algorithm, it suffices to
investigate local zeta functions in the almost normal crossings case. This case
can be effectively analyzed by using real analysis methods; in particular, a
van der Corput-type lemma plays a crucial role in the determination of the
above region.

understanding of how a wide range of intermediate confinement conditions drive
spontaneous stress focusing. We probe this regime with experiments and
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in which circular sheets are flattened in
their central region and quasi-statically drawn through a ring. Wrinkles
develop in the outer, free region, then are replaced by a truncated cone, which
forms in an abrupt transition to stress focusing. An analogy to pressure
buckling of an encased ring captures the force associated with this event.
Additional cones sequentially pattern the sheet, until axisymmetry is recovered
in most geometries. Cone size is sensitive to geometry, which we explain with a
1D model wherein concentrated strain acts as an effective elastic foundation.
This work contributes to the characterization of general confinement of thin
sheets, while broadening the understanding of the d-cone, a fundamental element
of stress focusing, as it appears in realistic settings.

plane waves because its sources are presumably located faraway. For nearby GW
sources, however, this approximation may be inaccurate due to the curved GW
wave front and the GW strength changes along the paths of PTA pulsar pulses. In
this paper, we analyze the near-field effect in the PTA detection of nearby
sources and find it is important if the source distance is less than a few tens
Mpc, and ignoring this effect may lead to a significant signal-to-noise
underestimation especially when the source distance is comparable to the pulsar
distances. As examples, we assume a nano-Hertz MBBH source located at either

detecting the LMC MBBH; however, if a number ($N\gtrsim10$) of stable
millisecond pulsars can be found in the LMC center, the MBBH may be detectable

complex manipulation tasks by using human demonstration and exploiting the

are constraints on the motion of the end effector of the robot. Examples of
such tasks include opening a door, opening a drawer, transferring granular
material from one container to another with a spoon, and loading dishes to a
dishwasher. Our approach consists of two steps: First, using the fact that a
motion in the task space of the robot can be approximated by using a sequence
of constant screw motions, we segment a human demonstration into a sequence of
constant screw motions. Second, we use the segmented screws to generate motion
plans via screw-linear interpolation for other instances of the same task. The
use of screw segmentation allows us to capture the invariants of the
demonstrations in a coordinate-free fashion, thus allowing us to plan for
different task instances from just one example. We present extensive
experimental results on a variety of manipulation scenarios showing that our
method can be used across a wide range of manipulation tasks.

by a rise in the power spectrum. The power spectrum becomes large at late times
due to decay of the inflaton into vectors through a $\phi F \tilde{F}$
coupling. Two background inflaton models which are well supported by current
Planck data are considered, natural inflation and hilltop inflation. Many of
the papers considering formation of PBHs have considered a peaked power
spectrum where $P_{\zeta}$ gets small again at late times. This avoids
overproducing miniature PBHs which would evaporate and could violate BBN and
CMB bounds. This paper examines the other way of avoiding these bounds,
producing PBHs from perturbations formed closer to the end of inflation such
that the PBHs are too small to violate these bounds. This has the advantage of
allowing for simpler models in that no additional feature is needed to be added
to evade constraints. Although these black holes would have evaporated, they
can be close to without exceeding current BBN bounds, making it possible the
signature will be revealed in the future. We calculate how the various model
parameters affect the mass and number of PBHs produced. Any evidence for PBHs
sourced from an inflationary power spectrum would provide evidence for
inflation on a drastically different energy scale from the CMB, and thus would
be highly valuable in answering what occurred during inflation.

receives $d(s,y)$ for a distance function $d$. The goal is to make as few

decomposable distances, i.e., distances of the form $d(s,y) = \sum_{i=1}^n
f(s_i, y_i)$ for some function $f$, which includes the important cases of
Hamming distance, $\ell_p$-norms, and $M$-estimators, to the best of our
knowledge this problem has not been studied for non-decomposable distances, for
which there are important special cases such as edit distance, dynamic time
warping (DTW), Frechet distance, earth mover's distance, and so on. We initiate
the study and develop a general framework for such distances. Interestingly,
for some distances such as DTW or Frechet, exact recovery of the sequence $s$
is provably impossible, and so we show by allowing the characters in $y$ to be
drawn from a slightly larger alphabet this then becomes possible. In a number
of cases we obtain optimal or near-optimal query complexity. We also study the
role of adaptivity for a number of different distance functions. One motivation
for understanding non-adaptivity is that the query sequence can be fixed and
the distances of the input to the queries provide a non-linear embedding of the
input, which can be used in downstream applications involving, e.g., neural

V2, with the naive quantization strategy and without access to real-world data,
consistently achieves competitive results, showing potential as a powerful

50.9 box AP and 44.1 mask AP on COCO, and 47.2 mIoU on ADE20K. We hope that

fragment of linear logic, without resorting to the use of negation. Linear
bicategories are the bicategorical version of linearly distributive categories.
Essentially, a linear bicategory has two forms of composition, each determining
the structure of a bicategory, and the two compositions are related by a linear
distribution.
  While it is standard in the field of monoidal topology that the category of
quantale-valued relations is a bicategory, we begin by showing that if the
quantale is a Girard quantale, we obtain a linear bicategory. We further show
that the category $QRel$ for $Q$ a unital quantale is a Girard quantaloid if
and only if $Q$ is a Girard quantale. The tropical and arctic semiring
structures fit together into a Girard quantale, so this construction is likely
to have multiple applications. More generally, we define LD-quantales, which
are sup-lattices with two quantale structures related by a linear distribution,
and show that $QRel$ is a linear bicategory if $Q$ is an LD-quantale.
  We then consider several standard constructions from bicategory theory, and
show that these lift to the linear bicategory setting and produce new examples
of linear bicategories. In particular, we consider quantaloids. We first define
the notion of a linear quantaloid ${\cal Q}$ and then consider linear ${\cal
Q}$-categories and linear monads in ${\cal Q}$, where ${\cal Q}$ is a linear
quantaloid. Every linear quantaloid is a linear bicategory.
  We also consider the bicategory whose objects are locales, 1-cells are
bimodules and two-cells are bimodule homomorphisms. This bicategory turns out
to be what we call a Girard bicategory, which are in essence a closed version
of linear bicategories.

(""OK"" and ""BAD"") are automatically generated by comparing words between MT
sentences and the post-edited sentences through a Translation Error Rate (TER)
toolkit. While the post-editing effort can be used to measure the translation
quality to some extent, we find it usually conflicts with the human judgement

we first create a golden benchmark dataset, namely \emph{HJQE} (Human Judgement

poorly translated words on their judgements. Additionally, to further make use
of the parallel corpus, we propose the self-supervised pre-training with two
tag correcting strategies, namely tag refinement strategy and tree-based
annotation strategy, to make the TER-based artificial QE corpus closer to

algebro-geometric realization of $\tau$-tilting finiteness of this family:
$\Lambda$ is $\tau$-tilting finite if and only if $\Lambda$ is brick-discrete,

  Our results rely on our full classification of minimal brick-infinite

$Brick(\Lambda)$ is the disjoint union of a unique generic brick with a

perpendicular to the field as well as more conventional ones parallel to the

spin canting effect or the presence of cluster magnetic multipolar ordering.
However, a general theory of TM based on microscopic understanding is still
missing. Here, we construct a general microscopic theory of TM in
antiferromagnets with cluster magnetic multipolar ordering by considering
classical spin Hamiltonians with spin anisotropy that arises from the
spin-orbit coupling. First, from general symmetry analysis, we show that TM can
appear only when all crystalline symmetries are broken other than the
antiunitary mirror, antiunitary two-fold rotation, and inversion symmetries.
Moreover, by analyzing spin Hamiltonians, we show that TM always appears when
the degenerate ground state manifold of the spin Hamiltonian is discrete. On
the other hand, when the degenerate ground state manifold is continuous, TM
generally does not appear except when the magnetic field direction and the spin
configuration satisfy specific geometric conditions under single-ion
anisotropy. Finally, we show that TM can induce anomalous planar Hall Effect, a
unique transport phenomenon that can be used to probe multipolar
antiferromagnetic structures. We believe that our theory provides a useful
guideline for understanding the anomalous magnetic responses of the
antiferromagnets with complex magnetic structures.

learning algorithms in multi-agent systems, intentionally ignoring the effect
of other strategic agents present in their environment. This paper studies
$N$-player mean-field games from a decentralized learning perspective with two
primary objectives: (i) to study the convergence properties of independent
learners, and (ii) to identify structural properties of $N$-player mean-field
games that can guide algorithm design. Toward the first objective, we study the
learning iterates obtained by independent learners, and we use recent results
from POMDP theory to show that these iterates converge under mild conditions.
In particular, we consider four information structures corresponding to
information at each agent: (1) global state + local action; (2) local state,
mean-field state + local action; (3) local state, compressed mean-field state +
local action; (4) local state with local action. We present a notion of
subjective equilibrium suitable for the analysis of independent learners.
Toward the second objective, we study a family of dynamical systems on the set
of joint policies. The dynamical systems under consideration are subject to a
so-called $\epsilon$-satisficing condition: agents who are subjectively
$\epsilon$-best-responding at a given joint policy do not change their policy.
We establish a useful structural property relating to such dynamical systems.
Finally, we develop an independent learning algorithm for $N$-player mean-field
games that drives play to subjective $\epsilon$-equilibrium under self-play,
exploiting the aforementioned structural properties to guarantee convergence of
policies. Notably, we avoid requiring agents to follow the same policy (via a
representative agent) during the learning process, which has been the typical
approach in the existing literature on learning for mean-field games.

leverage scores, lead to regression errors that are random and may exhibit

tackle this challenge, we propose to augment the potential interatomic forces

different strengths. Second, existing diffusion-based models essentially shift
elements in geometry along the gradient of data density. Such a process lacks
enough exploration in the intermediate steps of the Langevin dynamics. To
address this issue, we introduce a distributional controlling variable in each
diffusion/reverse step to enforce thorough explorations and further improve
generation diversity.
  Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
model significantly outperforms existing methods for both unconditional and
conditional generation tasks. We also conduct case studies to help understand
the physicochemical properties of the generated molecules.

important for sensor applications involving timely status updates. In many
cases, the wireless signals from one sensor can be received by multiple access

which they can share information through a wired backbone network. We first
study a basic backbone-assisted COoperative AP (Co-AP) system where APs share
only decoded packets. Experimental results on software-defined radios (SDR)
indicate that Co-AP significantly improves the average AoI performance over a
single-AP system. Next, we investigate an improved Co-AP system, called
Soft-Co-AP. In addition to sharing decoded packets, Soft-Co-AP shares and
collects soft information of packets that the APs fail to decode for further
joint decoding. A critical issue in Soft-Co-AP is determining the number of
quantization bits that represent the soft information (each soft bit) shared
over the backbone. While more quantization bits per soft bit improves the joint
decoding performance, it leads to higher backbone delay. We experimentally
study the average AoI of Soft-Co-AP by evaluating the tradeoff between the
backbone delay and the number of quantization bits. SDR experiments show that
when the number of sensors is large, Soft-Co-AP further reduces the average AoI
by 12% compared with Co-AP. Interestingly, good average AoI performance is
usually achieved when the number of quantization bits per soft bit is neither
too large nor too small.

many traffic analyses benefit from temporal aggregation of multiple
simultaneous netflows, which can be computationally challenging. To alleviate
this concern, a novel netflow compression and resampling method has been
developed leveraging GraphBLAS hyperspace traffic matrices that preserve
anonymization while enabling subrange analysis. Standard multitemporal spatial
analyses are then performed on each subrange to generate detailed statistical
aggregates of the source packets, source fan-out, unique links, destination
fan-in, and destination packets of each subrange which can then be used for
background modeling and anomaly detection. A simple file format based on
GraphBLAS sparse matrices is developed for storing these statistical
aggregates. This method is scale tested on the MIT SuperCloud using a 50
trillion packet netflow corpus from several hundred sites collected over
several months. The resulting compression achieved is significant (<0.1 bit per
packet) enabling extremely large netflow analyses to be stored and transported.
The single node parallel performance is analyzed in terms of both processors

analyses at over a million packets/sec (roughly equivalent to a 10 Gigabit

relaxes the requirement on model calibration in a ""model-free"" manner that
enables robustness against modeling uncertainty and enhances the real-time

proven via the Lyapunov theory. The optimal control law is parameterized and
then approximated by neural networks (NN), which moderates the computational

systems (ADAS) and corresponding SoC developments. An ADAS SoC represents a
heterogeneous architecture that consists of CPUs, GPUs and artificial
intelligence (AI) accelerators. In order to guarantee its safety and
reliability, it must process massive amount of raw data collected from multiple
redundant sources such as high-definition video cameras, Radars, and Lidars to
recognize objects correctly and to make the right decisions promptly. A domain
specific memory architecture is essential to achieve the above goals. We
present a shared memory architecture that enables high data throughput among
multiple parallel accesses native to the ADAS applications. It also provides
deterministic access latency with proper isolation under the stringent
real-time QoS constraints. A prototype is built and analyzed. The results
validate that the proposed architecture provides close to 100\% throughput for
both read and write accesses generated simultaneously by many accessing masters
with full injection rate. It can also provide consistent QoS to the domain
specific payloads while enabling the scalability and modularity of the design.

  Foundations of Robotics (WAFR 2022). To be published in the Springer
  Proceedings in Advanced Robotics (SPAR)",,,,"cs.AI cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Solving Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with
continuous actions is challenging, particularly for high-dimensional action
spaces. To alleviate this difficulty, we propose a new sampling-based online
POMDP solver, called Adaptive Discretization using Voronoi Trees (ADVT). It
uses Monte Carlo Tree Search in combination with an adaptive discretization of
the action space as well as optimistic optimization to efficiently sample
high-dimensional continuous action spaces and compute the best action to
perform. Specifically, we adaptively discretize the action space for each
sampled belief using a hierarchical partition which we call a Voronoi tree. A
Voronoi tree is a Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) that implicitly maintains the
partition of a cell as the Voronoi diagram of two points sampled from the cell.
This partitioning strategy keeps the cost of partitioning and estimating the
size of each cell low, even in high-dimensional spaces where many sampled
points are required to cover the space well. ADVT uses the estimated sizes of
the cells to form an upper-confidence bound of the action values of the cell,
and in turn uses the upper-confidence bound to guide the Monte Carlo Tree
Search expansion and further discretization of the action space. This strategy
enables ADVT to better exploit local information in the action space, leading
to an action space discretization that is more adaptive, and hence more
efficient in computing good POMDP solutions, compared to existing solvers.
Experiments on simulations of four types of benchmark problems indicate that
ADVT outperforms and scales substantially better to high-dimensional continuous
action spaces, compared to state-of-the-art continuous action POMDP solvers.

elections, sports competitions, recommendations, and information retrieval.
However, little attention has been paid to the security issue of such
algorithms, in contrast to numerous research work on the computational and
statistical characteristics. Driven by huge profits, the potential adversary
has strong motivation and incentives to manipulate the ranking list. Meanwhile,
the intrinsic vulnerability of the rank aggregation methods is not well studied
in the literature. To fully understand the possible risks, we focus on the
purposeful adversary who desires to designate the aggregated results by
modifying the pairwise data in this paper. From the perspective of the
dynamical system, the attack behavior with a target ranking list is a fixed
point belonging to the composition of the adversary and the victim. To perform
the targeted attack, we formulate the interaction between the adversary and the
victim as a game-theoretic framework consisting of two continuous operators
while Nash equilibrium is established. Then two procedures against HodgeRank
and RankCentrality are constructed to produce the modification of the original
data. Furthermore, we prove that the victims will produce the target ranking
list once the adversary masters the complete information. It is noteworthy that
the proposed methods allow the adversary only to hold incomplete information or
imperfect feedback and perform the purposeful attack. The effectiveness of the
suggested target attack strategies is demonstrated by a series of toy
simulations and several real-world data experiments. These experimental results
show that the proposed methods could achieve the attacker's goal in the sense
that the leading candidate of the perturbed ranking list is the designated one

hour of data. A clear two-step decrease is seen in the cosmic-ray density with
the first $\sim2\%$ decrease after the interplanetary shock arrival followed by
the second $\sim5\%$ decrease inside the magnetic flux rope (MFR) at 15 GV.
Most strikingly, a large bidirectional streaming along the magnetic field is
observed in the MFR with a peak amplitude of $\sim5\%$ at 15 GV which is
comparable to the total density decrease inside the MFR. The bidirectional
streaming could be explained by adiabatic deceleration and/or focusing in the
expanding MFR, which have stronger effects for pitch angles near 90$^\circ$, or
by selective entry of GCRs along a leg of the MFR. The peak anisotropy and
density depression in the flux rope both decrease with increasing rigidity. The
spectra vary dynamically indicating that the temporal variations of density and

advantages over FinFET technology and is an attractive solution for sub-5 nm

semiconducting layered materials (such as, MoS$_2$) as the channel due to their
dangling-bond-free ultra-thin nature and the possibility of layer-by-layer
transfer. MoS$_2$-based MBCFET is thus an attractive proposition for drive
current boost without compromising on the electrostatics and footprint. Here we
demonstrate a 3-level MoS$_2$ MBCFET, where each vertically stacked channel is
dual-gated to achieve a saturation current of 174.9 $\mu$A (which translates to
\txc{90 $\mu$A per $\mu$m footprint width (@2.7 $\mu$m channel length), a
near-ideal sub-threshold slope of 63 mV/dec, and an on-off ratio $>$$10^8$.
This work sets the benchmark for layer-material-based MBCFET in terms of the

characterized by higher-order topological states at the outer boundary of

Letter, it is found that the higher-order topological quasicrystalline
insulators (HOTQIs) have non-0D TCSs arrays at the outer and inner boundaries,
which breaks through the limitation of bulk-edge-corner correspondence
(corresponding dimension is 2D-1D-0D). The universal theoretical framework of
the multimer analysis method is improved and the difference in the average
charge density is proposed as the real-space topological index, which
effectively characterizes the unconventional higher-order topology in HOTQIs.
Furthermore, HOTQIs and their non-0D TCSs arrays in photonic system are
experimentally observed for the first time. These results offer a promising
avenue for investigating TCSs with high integration and multi-region
distribution and pave the way for exploring the topological phenomena and
applications of photonic and phononic quasicrystals.

learn an embedding model in a contrastive manner that encodes the

dominated by the number of computations of a pairwise dissimilarity measure.
Such a constraint, for larger data sets, puts at a disadvantage the use of all
the classical linkage criteria but the single linkage one. However, it is known
that the single linkage clustering algorithm is very sensitive to outliers,
produces highly skewed dendrograms, and therefore usually does not reflect the
true underlying data structure -- unless the clusters are well-separated. To
overcome its limitations, we propose a new hierarchical clustering linkage
criterion called Genie. Namely, our algorithm links two clusters in such a way
that a chosen economic inequity measure (e.g., the Gini- or Bonferroni-index)
of the cluster sizes does not drastically increase above a given threshold. The
presented benchmarks indicate a high practical usefulness of the introduced
method: it most often outperforms the Ward or average linkage in terms of the
clustering quality while retaining the single linkage's speed. The Genie
algorithm is easily parallelizable and thus may be run on multiple threads to
speed up its execution even further. Its memory overhead is small: there is no
need to precompute the complete distance matrix to perform the computations in
order to obtain a desired clustering. It can be applied on arbitrary spaces
equipped with a dissimilarity measure, e.g., on real vectors, DNA or protein
sequences, images, rankings, informetric data, etc. A reference implementation
of the algorithm has been included in the open source 'genie' package for R.

medical ultrasound. State-of-the-art TBP optimization has well-known drawbacks
like non-uniform beam width over depth, presence of significant side lobes and
quick energy drop out after the focal depth. To overcome these limitations, we
developed a novel optimization approach for TBP by focusing the analysis on the
narrow band approximation of the TBP, particularly suited for Continuous Wave
Doppler (CWD) and Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) elastography, and
considering transmit delays as free variables instead of linked to a specific
focal depth. Approach. We formulate the problem as a non linear Least Squares
problem to minimize the difference between the TBP corresponding to a set of
delays and the desired one, modeled as a 2D rectangular shape elongated in the
direction of the beam axis. The narrow band case leads naturally to reformulate
the problem in the frequency domain, with a significant computational saving
with respect to time domain. Main Results. Results obtained by our synthetic
software simulation show the main lobe width is considerably more intense and
uniform over all the depth range with respect to the state-of-the-art
optimization. The intensity gain of the beam ranges from $17\%$ to $54\%$ with
respect than the standard focused beam patterns, the uniformity gain of the
beam width ranges from $3.5$ to $9$ times the standard level and the side lobe
variability reduction ranges from $1.1$ to $2.8$ times the standard level. Our
optimized delay profile results in a combination of standard delay profiles at
different focal depths. Significance. The proposed method improves the
concentration of the ultrasound energy along a desired axis resulting in
increased measurement accuracy in ARFI elastography and CWD modalities.

realistic rough surface cosmic dust particles from spheres, super-ellipsoids
and fractal aggregates depending on the measured bulk-density and porosity.
Initially, spheres having $N_d$ dipoles or lattice points are crafted by
selecting random material and space seed cells to generate strongly damaged

are fractal aggregates having rough surface irregular grains. REST has been
applied to create agglomerated debris, agglomerated debris super-ellipsoids and

profiles: power-law, broken power-law, and models with a resonance motivated by
primordial black hole scenarios. We derive the signal-to-noise ratio associated
with an optimal estimator for the detection of non-factorizable kinematic

information in preoperative staging of rectal cancer. Above all, accurate
preoperative discrimination between T2 and T3 stages is arguably both the most
challenging and clinically significant task for rectal cancer treatment, as
chemo-radiotherapy is usually recommended to patients with T3 (or greater)
stage cancer. In this study, we present a volumetric convolutional neural
network to accurately discriminate T2 from T3 stage rectal cancer with rectal
MR volumes. Specifically, we propose 1) a custom ResNet-based volume encoder
that models the inter-slice relationship with late fusion (i.e., 3D convolution
at the last layer), 2) a bilinear computation that aggregates the resulting
features from the encoder to create a volume-wise feature, and 3) a joint
minimization of triplet loss and focal loss. With MR volumes of pathologically
confirmed T2/T3 rectal cancer, we perform extensive experiments to compare
various designs within the framework of residual learning. As a result, our
network achieves an AUC of 0.831, which is higher than the reported accuracy of
the professional radiologist groups. We believe this method can be extended to
other volume analysis tasks

identify images of a target person from a large-scale person image database.
Existing methods generally face a \textbf{color over-reliance problem}, which
means that the models rely heavily on color information when matching
cross-modal data. Indeed, color information is an important decision-making
accordance for retrieval, but the over-reliance on color would distract the
model from other key clues (e.g. texture information, structural information,
etc.), and thereby lead to a sub-optimal retrieval performance. To solve this

CAIBC contains three branches including an RGB branch, a grayscale (GRS) branch
and a color (CLR) branch. Besides, with the aim of making full use of all-round

employed to enable the three branches which attend to varied aspects of

experimental analysis is carried out to evaluate our proposed CAIBC method on

a large amount of color images as the training samples to fit the parameters.
During the training process, the color images are the ground truths, and we
learn the optimal parameters for the matching process by minimizing the errors
in terms of the parameters for the matching function. To deal with images with
various compositions, a global feature is introduced, which can be used to
classify the images with respect to their compositions, and then learn the
optimal matching parameters for each image category individually. What's more,
a spatial consistency based post-processing is design to smooth the extracted
color information from the reference image to remove matching errors. Extensive

training of neural networks since it needs to construct adversarial examples
for the entire training data at every iteration. By leveraging the theory of
coreset selection, we show how selecting a small subset of training data
provides a principled approach to reducing the time complexity of robust

directly related to how well our coresets can approximate the gradient computed
over the entire training data. Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we
propose using this gradient approximation error as our adversarial coreset
selection objective to reduce the training set size effectively. Once built, we
run adversarial training over this subset of the training data. Unlike existing
methods, our approach can be adapted to a wide variety of training objectives,
including TRADES, $\ell_p$-PGD, and Perceptual Adversarial Training. We conduct

$L$, we show that the absolute value of the heat current scales at most as
$\Theta (L^3)$ in a limit of large $L$. Also, we present an example that
saturates this bound in terms of scaling: non-interacting particles globally
coupled with a thermal bath. However, the construction of such system requires
many-body interactions induced by the environment, which may be difficult to
realize with the current technology. To consider more feasible cases, we focus
on a class of system where any non-diagonal elements of the noise operator
(derived from the system-environment interaction Hamiltonian) become zero in
the system energy basis, if the energy difference is beyond a certain value
$\Delta E$. Then, for $\Delta E = \Theta (L^0)$, we derive another scaling
bound $\Theta (L^2)$ on the absolute value of the heat current, and the
so-called superradiance belongs to a class to saturate this bound. Our results

management of fog domains. One of the main influencing factors on this
complexity is the large number of devices, i.e. the high scale level of the
infrastructure. Fog colonies are subsets of fog devices that are managed
independently from the other colonies. Thus, the number of devices involved in
the management of a colony is much smaller. Previous studies have evaluated the
influence of the fog colony layout on system performance metrics. We propose to
use a hierarchical clustering as the base definition of the fog colony layout
of the fog infrastructure. The dendrogram obtained from this hierarchical
clustering includes all the colony candidates. A genetic algorithm is in charge
of selecting the subset of colony candidates that optimizes the two performance
metrics under study: the network communication time between users and
applications, and the execution time of the algorithms that manage internally
the placement of the applications in each colony. We implemented the NSGA-II, a
common multi-objective approach for GAs, to evaluate our proposal. The results
show that a meta-heuristic such as a GA improves the performance metrics by
defining the fog colony layout through the use of the dendrogram. Nine
different experiment scenarios, varying the number of applications and fog
devices, were studied. In the worst of the cases, 137 generations were enough
to the results of the GA dominated the solutions obtained with two control

configurations and shapes during their manipulation. Hence, robots should not
only understand the current cloth configuration but also be able to predict the
future possible behaviors of the cloth. This paper addresses the problem of
indirectly controlling the configuration of certain points of a textile object,
by applying actions on other parts of the object through the use of a Model
Predictive Control (MPC) strategy, which also allows to foresee the behavior of
indirectly controlled points. The designed controller finds the optimal control

corners of a square piece of cloth by grasping its upper corners. To do so, we
propose and validate a linear cloth model that allows solving the MPC-related
optimization problem in real time. Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques are
used to learn the optimal parameters of the proposed cloth model and also to
tune the resulting MPC. After obtaining accurate tracking results in
simulation, the full control scheme was implemented and executed in a real
robot, obtaining accurate tracking even in adverse conditions. While total
observed errors reach the 5 cm mark, for a 30x30 cm cloth, an analysis shows
the MPC contributes less than 30% to that value.

we aim to perform style transfer for architectural photographs. However, the
special composition in architectural photography poses great challenges for
style transfer in this type of photographs. Existing neural style transfer
methods treat the architectural images as a single entity, which would generate
mismatched chrominance and destroy geometric features of the original
architecture, yielding unrealistic lighting, wrong color rendition, and visual
artifacts such as ghosting, appearance distortion, or color mismatching. In
this paper, we specialize a neural style transfer method for architectural
photography. Our method addresses the composition of the foreground and
background in an architectural photograph in a two-branch neural network that
separately considers the style transfer of the foreground and the background,
respectively. Our method comprises a segmentation module, a learning-based
image-to-image translation module, and an image blending optimization module.
We trained our image-to-image translation neural network with a new dataset of
unconstrained outdoor architectural photographs captured at different magic
times of a day, utilizing additional semantic information for better
chrominance matching and geometry preservation. Our experiments show that our
method can produce photorealistic lighting and color rendition on both the
foreground and background, and outperforms general image-to-image translation

  Constraints with Guaranteed Accuracy","12pages, 15 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper focuses on the attitude pointing control problem under
pointing-forbidden constraints and performance constraints. The spacecraft is
expected to align its sensor's boresight to a desired direction, while the
terminal control accuracy and the attitude adjustment rapidity should also be
guaranteed simultaneously. To resolve this problem, a switching controller
structure is proposed in this paper based on the reduced-attitude
representation, fusing the artificial potential field (APF) methodology and the
Prescribed Performance Control (PPC) scheme together. Firstly, a novel
artificial potential field is presented, and a particular function is designed
for the mollification of the switching process, aiming at providing a smooth
transition for the system status. Subsequently, we propose a special
performance function, which can freeze the PPC part when necessary. In this
way, the intrinsic contradictory between the fast attitude maneuver and
forbidden direction avoidance is tackled
  Further, an asynchronous switching strategy is designed, guarantees the
system's stability. Based on these proposed issues, a switching backstepping
controller is developed, and a tracking differentiator(TD) is employed to
generate a smooth approximation of differential signals. Numerical simulation
results are illustrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

allows for sensitive characterization of light fields. Conventionally a
homodyne interferometer is operated by locking the relative phase of a

often used method is to perform a slow continuous modulation of the reference
beam arm length that corresponds to averaging all relative phases during the
measurement.Here we show theoretically and experimentally that this quadrature
averaging can be advantageous in estimating the parameters of a resonant
optical cavity. We demonstrate that the averaging turns the transduction
function, from cavity frequency fluctuations into the interferometer signal,
into a simple function of the laser detuning that, notably, does not depend on
the parameters of possible non-resonant channels present in the system. The
method needs no active feedback and gives results that are easy to interpret.
Moreover, the phase-averaged measurement allows to characterize the absolute

Exciton-polaritons are generated by coupling electrically injected excitons in

decay into photons emitted from the top surface of the transistor. Thanks to
the high-finesse of the metasurface cavity, we achieve a large Rabi splitting

the intrinsic excitonic emission of the perovskite film. Moreover, we show that
the directionality of polaritonic electroluminescence can be dynamically tuned

origin of signals either due to a planetary companion or to stellar activity.
In fact, the existence of a planetary companion has been proposed, as well as
contested, around the relatively bright, nearby M3.0V star AD Leo at the same
period as the stellar rotation of 2.23d. Aims: We further investigate the
nature of this signal. We introduce new CARMENES optical and near-IR RV data
and an analysis in combination with archival data taken by HIRES and HARPS,
along with more recent data from HARPS-N, GIANO-B, and HPF. Also, we address
the confusion concerning the binarity of AD Leo. Methods: We consider possible
correlations between the RVs and various stellar activity indicators accessible
with CARMENES. We applied models within a Bayesian framework to determine
whether a Keplerian model, a red-noise quasi-periodic model using a Gaussian
process, or a mixed model would explain the observed data best. We also
exclusively focus on spectral lines potentially associated with stellar
activity. Results: The CARMENES RV data agree with the previously reported
periodicity of 2.23d, correlate with some activity indicators, and exhibit
chromaticity. However, when considering the entire RV data set, we find that a
mixed model composed of a stable and a variable component performs best.
Moreover, when recomputing the RVs using only spectral lines insensitive to
activity, there appears to be some residual power at the period of interest. We
therefore conclude that it is not possible to determinedly prove that there is
no planet orbiting in synchronization with the stellar rotation given our data,
current tools, machinery, and knowledge of how stellar activity affects RVs. We
do rule out planets more massive than 27M_E (=0.084M_J). We also exclude any
binary companion around AD Leo with Msini > 3-6M_J on orbital periods <14yr.

decoder which aggregates the subgraph information from the encoder output and
generates the probability of relations for each step of reasoning. The basic
idea behind Ruleformer is regarding rule mining process as a sequence to

of observations. To describe elastic properties one should rely on theoretical
models. The most widely used is Coulomb crystal model (system of point-like
charges on neutralizing uniform background), in some works it is corrected for
electron screening. These models neglect finite size of nuclei. This
approximation is well justified except for the innermost crustal layers, where
nuclei size becomes comparable with the inter-nuclear spacing. Still, even in
those dense layers it seems reasonable to apply the Coulomb crystal result, if
one assumes that nuclei are spherically symmetric: Coulomb interaction between
them should be the same as interaction between point-like charges. This
argument is indeed correct, however, as we point here, shear of crustal lattice
generates (microscopic) quadrupole electrostatic potential in a vicinity of
lattice cites, which induces deformation on the nuclei. We analyze this problem
analytically within compressible liquid drop model, using ionic spheroid model
(which is generalization of well known ion sphere model). In particular, for
ground state crust composition the effective shear modulus is reduced for a
factor of $1-u^{5/3}/(2+3\,u-4\,u^{1/3})$, where u is the filling factor (ratio
of the nuclei volume to the volume of the cell). This result is universal and
does not depend on the applied nucleon interaction model. For the innermost
layers of inner crust u~0.2 leading to reduction of the shear modulus by ~25%,
which can be important for correct interpretation of quasi-periodic
oscillations in the tails of magnetar flares.

unknown function whose values are measured with an error at unequally spaced
points is proposed. The derivative at a given point is calculated using the
effective increments of the function and the argument, taking into account the
different weight coefficients for near and far measurement points. Simulation
modeling on test functions with known derivatives is applied to determine
rational values of weight coefficients. Simulation results are described in
detail on two test functions, one of which simulates the process of water
cooling of a hot steel sheet, the second is a complex oscillatory process with
variable frequency and amplitude. It was found that the optimal values of
weight coefficients remain approximately the same for essentially different
functions, which allows us to recommend the same formula for all cases. In
contrast to the classical methods of numerical differentiation of functions
tabulated at unequally spaced nodes, the proposed formula simultaneously takes
into account the smoothing of empirical data. It is shown that this
significantly increases the accuracy of the numerical derivative estimate even
in cases where the random error of the function measurement is a very small
value, from 1%. The formula obtained is recommended for use in solving any
problems requiring the estimation of the derivative of an empirical function,
including the calculation of the stress-strain state of metal, the description
of thermal processes, and the determination of the properties of materials.

extraction techniques, a large number of feature points might be available in a
single shot. It is promising to devise a consistent estimator, i.e., the
estimate can converge to the true camera pose as the number of points
increases. To this end, we propose a consistent PnP solver, named \emph{CPnP},
with bias elimination. Specifically, linear equations are constructed from the
original projection model via measurement model modification and variable
elimination, based on which a closed-form least-squares solution is obtained.
We then analyze and subtract the asymptotic bias of this solution, resulting in
a consistent estimate. Additionally, Gauss-Newton (GN) iterations are executed
to refine the consistent solution. Our proposed estimator is efficient in terms
of computations -- it has $O(n)$ computational complexity. Experimental tests

materials from scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS)
measurements. When the charge order presents spatial variations at the atomic
scale inside the unit cell and is energy dependent, particular care should be
taken. In such cases the use of the lock-in technique, while acquiring an STM
topography in closed feedback loop, leads to systematically incorrect dI/dV
measurements giving a false local charge order. A correct method is either to
perform a constant height measurement or to perform a full grid of dI/dV(V)
spectroscopies, using a bias voltage setpoint outside the material bandwidth
where the local density-of-states (LDOS) is spatially homogeneous. We take as a
paradigmatic example of two-dimensional material the 1/3 single-layer
Pb/Si(111). As large areas of this phase cannot be grown, charge ordering in
this system is not accessible to angular resolved photoemission or grazing
x-ray diffraction. Previous investigations by STM/STS supplemented by {\it ab
initio} Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations concluded that this
material undergoes a phase transition to a low-temperature $3\times 3$
reconstruction where one Pb atom moves up, the two remaining Pb atoms shifting
down. A third STM/STS study by Adler {\it et al.} [PRL 123, 086401 (2019)] came
to the opposite conclusion, i.e. that two Pb atoms move up, while one Pb atom
shifts down. This latter erroneous conclusion comes from a misuse of the
lock-in technique. In contrast, using a full grid of dI/dV(V) spectroscopy
measurements, we show that the energy-dependent LDOS maps agree very well with
state-of-the-art DFT calculations confirming the one-up two-down charge
ordering. This structural and charge re-ordering in the $3\times 3$ unit cell
is equally driven by electron-electron interactions and the coupling to the
substrate.

We found that the regularization significantly reduces model complexity

Asakura--Oosawa (AO) model where the interaction between the small particles is
neglected but the big-small and big-big interactions are present and can be
condensed into an effective depletion interaction among the big particles
alone. The original AO model involves hard spherical particles in three spatial
dimensions with interaction diameters $\sigma_\text{pp}=0$,
$\sigma_\text{cc}>0$ and $\sigma_\text{pc}>\sigma_\text{cc}/2$ respectively,
where $\sigma_{ij}$ with $\{i,j\}=\{\text{p},\text{c}\}$ (indicating the
physical interpretation of the small and big particles as polymers (p) and
colloids (c), respectively) is the minimum possible center-to-center distance
between particle $i$ and particle $j$ allowed by the excluded-volume
constraints. It is common knowledge that there are only pairwise effective
depletion interactions between the big particles if the geometric condition
$\sigma_\text{pc}/\sigma_\text{cc} < 1/\sqrt{3}$ is fulfilled. In this case,
triplet and higher-order many body interactions are vanishing and the
equilibrium statistics of the binary mixture can exactly be mapped onto that of
an effective one-component system with the effective depletion pair-potential.
Here we prove this geometric criterion rigorously and generalize it to
polydisperse mixtures and to anisotropic particle shapes in any dimension,
providing geometric criteria sufficient to guarantee the absence of triplet and
higher-order many body interactions. For an external hard wall confining the
full mixture, we also give criteria which guarantee that the system can be

nearest hyperbolic class prototype. We use an in-house skin lesion dataset

candidates based on the analysis of the accumulating light curves obtained by
the satellite. The list includes the estimated epochs, periods, and durations
of the potential transits. As the point spread function (PSF) of TESS is
relatively wide, follow-up photometric observations at higher spatial
resolution are required in order to exclude apparent transits that are actually
blended background eclipsing binaries (BEBs). Aims: The Gaia space mission,
with its growing database of epoch photometry and high angular resolution,
enables the production of distinct light curves for all sources included in the
TESS PSF, up to the limiting magnitude of Gaia. This paper reports the results
of an ongoing Gaia-TESS collaboration that uses the Gaia photometry to
facilitate the identification of BEB candidates and even to confirm on-target
candidates in some cases. Methods: We inspected the Gaia photometry of the
individual sources included in the TESS PSF, searching for periodic dimming
events compatible with their ephemerides and uncertainties, as published by
TESS. The performance of the search depends mainly on the number of Gaia
measurements during transit and their precision. Results: Since February 2021,
the collaboration has been able to confirm 126 on-target candidates and exclude
124 as BEBs. Since June 2021, when our search methodology matured, we have been
able to identify on the order of 5% as on-target candidates and another 5% as
BEBs. Conclusions: This synergistic approach is combining the complementary
capabilities of two of the astronomical space missions of NASA and ESA. It
serves to optimize the process of detecting new planets by making better use of
the resources of the astronomical community.

galaxy distances, is a major challenge for cosmography. The data is very noisy
and sparse. Estimated distances, and thereby peculiar velocities, are strongly
affected by the Malmquist-like lognormal bias. Two algorithms have been
recently introduced to perform reconstructions from such data: the Bias
Gaussian correction coupled with the Wiener filter (BGc/WF) and the HAMLET
implementation of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo forward modelling. The two
methods are tested here against mock catalogs that mimic the Cosmicflows-3
data. Specifically the reconstructed cosmography and moments of the velocity
field (monopole, dipole) are examined. A comparison is made to the ``exact''
wiener filter as well - namely the Wiener Filter in the unrealistic case of
zero observational errors. This is to understand the limits of the WF method.
The following is found. In the nearby regime ($d \lesssim 40 {\rm Mpc}/h$) the
two methods perform roughly equally well. HAMLET does slightly better in the
intermediate regime ($ 40 \lesssim d \lesssim 120 {\rm Mpc}/h$). The main
differences between the two appear in the most distant regime ($d \gtrsim 120
{\rm Mpc}/h$), close to the edge of the data. The HAMLET outperforms the BGc/WF
in terms of better and tighter correlations, yet in the distant regime the
HAMLET yields a somewhat biased reconstruction. Such biases are missing from
the BGc/WF reconstruction. In sum, both methods perform well and create
reliable reconstructions with significant differences apparent when details are
examined.

noise robustness, we introduce a correlation-coefficient-type penalty function
adaptable to XRD data with significant experimental noise. We apply the new

consider so-called inner crust - the layer, where neutron-excess nuclei are
immersed into degenerate gas of electrons and sea of quasi-free neutrons. It
was generally believed that spherical nuclei become unstable with respect to
quadrupole deformations at high densities and here we consider this
instability. Within perturbative approach we show that spherical nuclei with
equilibrium number density are, in fact, stable with respect to infinitesimal
quadrupole deformation. This is due to background of degenerate electrons and
associated electrostatic potential which maintain stability of spherical
nuclei. However, if the number of atomic nuclei per unit volume is much less
than the equilibrium value, instability can arise. To avoid confusion we stress
that our results are limited to infinitesimal deformations and do not guaranty
strict thermodynamic stability of spherical nuclei. In particular, they does
not exclude that substantially non-spherical nuclei (so-called pasta phase)
represent thermodynamic equilibrium state of the densest layers of neutron star

reliability of automatic face recognition (FR) systems in surveillance and
security scenarios. However, a massive amount of face data is usually
compressed before being analyzed due to limitations on transmission or storage.
The compressed images may lose the powerful identity information, resulting in
the performance degradation of the FR system. Herein, we make the first attempt
to study just noticeable difference (JND) for the FR system, which can be
defined as the maximum distortion that the FR system cannot notice. More
specifically, we establish a JND dataset including 3530 original images and
137,670 compressed images generated by advanced reference encoding/decoding
software based on the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard (VTM-15.0).
Subsequently, we develop a novel JND prediction model to directly infer JND
images for the FR system. In particular, in order to maximum redundancy removal
without impairment of robust identity information, we apply the encoder with
multiple feature extraction and attention-based feature decomposition modules
to progressively decompose face features into two uncorrelated components,
i.e., identity and residual features, via self-supervised learning. Then, the
residual feature is fed into the decoder to generate the residual map. Finally,
the predicted JND map is obtained by subtracting the residual map from the
original image. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed model
achieves higher accuracy of JND map prediction compared with the

young Jupiters and exo-Earths will require accessing very high contrasts at
small angular separations with an increased robustness to aberrations, three
constraints that drive current instrumentation development. This goal relies on
efficient coronagraphs set up on extremely large diameter telescopes such as
the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT), or the
Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). However, they tend to be subject to specific
aberrations that drastically deteriorate the coronagraph performance: their
primary mirror segmentation implies phasing errors or even missing segments,
and the size of the telescope imposes large spiders, generating low-wind effect
as already observed on the Very Large Telescope (VLT)/SPHERE instrument or at
the Subaru telescope, or adaptive-optics-due petaling, studied in simulations
in the ELT case. The ongoing development of coronagraphs has then to take into
account their sensitivity to such errors. We propose an innovative method to
generate coronagraphs robust to primary mirror phasing errors and low-wind and
adaptive-optics-due petaling effect. This method is based on the apodization of
the segment or petal instead of the entire pupil, this apodization being then
repeated to mimic the pupil redundancy. We validate this so-called Redundant
Apodized Pupil (RAP) method on a James Webb Space Telescope-like pupil composed
of 18 hexagonal segments segments to align, and on the VLT architecture in the
case of residual low-wind effect.

about two Earth radii, the so-called radius gap. This is interpreted as an
evolutionary effect driven by a variety of possible atmospheric mass loss
processes of exoplanets. For mass loss driven by an exoplanet's irradiation by
stellar X-ray and extreme-UV photons, the time evolution of the stellar
magnetic activity is important. It is known from observations of open stellar
clusters that stars of the same age and mass do not all follow the same time
evolution of activity-induced X-ray and extreme-UV luminosities. Here we
explore how a realistic spread of different stellar activity tracks influences
the mass loss and radius evolution of a simulated population of small
exoplanets and the observable properties of the radius gap. Our results show
qualitatively that different saturation time scales, i.e. the young age at
which stellar high-energy emission starts to decline, and different activity
decay tracks over moderate stellar ages can cause changes in the population
density of planets in the gap, as well as in the observable width of the gap.
We also find that while the first 100 million years of mass loss are highly
important to shape the radius gap, significant evolution of the gap properties
is expected to take place for at least the first 500-600 million years, i.e.
the age of the Hyades cluster. Observations of exoplanet populations with
defined ages will be able to shed more light on the radius gap evolution.

exoplanets, including Earth-like planets evolving around M dwarfs i.e., closer

to modulate the wavefront. Classical coronagraphs are not optimal: 1) they
impose a planetary photon loss, which is particularly problematic when the

aberrations such as the missing segments of the ELT are dynamic and not

from an adaptive tool to modulate the wavefront in both amplitude and phase. We
propose to combine in the pupil plane a deformable mirror (DM) to control the

micro-mirrors able to switch between two positions, to control its amplitude.

two components with a Lyot coronagraph. Since March 2022, CIDRE is assembled

dedicated to the calibration of the DMD. Since May 2022, it is operational and

  Positioning using Transfer Learning","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2104.02581",,,,"cs.RO eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper proposes a transfer learning approach to recalibrate our
previously developed Wheel Odometry Neural Network (WhONet) for vehicle
positioning in environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
are unavailable. The WhONet has been shown to possess the capability to learn
the uncertainties in the wheel speed measurements needed for correction and
accurate positioning of vehicles. These uncertainties may be manifested as tyre
pressure changes from driving on muddy and uneven terrains or wheel slips.
However, a common cause for concern for data-driven approaches, such as the
WhONet model, is usually the inability to generalise the models to a new
vehicle. In scenarios where machine learning models are trained in a specific
domain but deployed in another domain, the model's performance degrades. In
real-life scenarios, several factors are influential to this degradation, from
changes to the dynamics of the vehicle to new pattern distributions of the
sensor's noise, and bias will make the test sensor data vary from training
data. Therefore, the challenge is to explore techniques that allow the trained
machine learning models to spontaneously adjust to new vehicle domains. As
such, we propose the Recalibrated-Wheel Odometry neural Network (R-WhONet),
that adapts the WhONet model from its source domain (a vehicle and environment
on which the model is initially trained) to the target domain (a new vehicle on
which the trained model is to be deployed). Through a performance evaluation on
several GNSS outage scenarios - short-term complex driving scenarios, and on
longer-term GNSS outage scenarios. We demonstrate that a model trained in the
source domain does not generalise well to a new vehicle in the target domain.
However, we show that our new proposed framework improves the generalisation of
the WhONet model to new vehicles in the target domains by up to 32%.

estimate of the size of the region inside the droplet where the value of the
dynamic contact angle depends on a balance of viscous dissipation and capillary
stresses. Depending on how particle size compares with this viscous cut-off

one for execution steps and another for the number of tokens in the net
representing a client-server system, and these two evolve separately, which is
different from the standard BMC techniques in the Petri Nets formalism. This
$2D$-BMC strategy is implemented in a tool called DCModelChecker which
leverages the $2D$-BMC technique with a state-of-the-art satisfiability modulo

be separately identified, but the fainter stars and quasars often coincide with
the faint galaxies. We have also investigated galaxies with unusual FUV
morphology which are likely to be galaxies experiencing ram-pressure stripping
in the cluster. Amongst others, two confirmed cluster members which were not
investigated in the literature earlier, have been found to show unusual FUV
emission. All the distorted sources are likely to have fallen into the cluster
recently, and hence have not virialised yet. A subset of our data have optical

the arbitrary frequency of pumping microwaves. In the case of individual
skyrmions, no current is pumped when microwave frequency is inside the gap of

field. This structure was selected as a high galaxy overdensity at $z>3$ in the
COSMOS2020 catalog. It contains ten candidate members, of which eight are
assembled in a $10''\times10''$ area with the highest sky density among known
protoclusters and groups at $z>3$. Four out of ten sources were also detected
at 1.2$~$mm with Atacama Large Millimeter Array continuum observations.
Photometric redshifts, measured by four independent methods, fall within a
narrow range of $3.5<z<3.9$ and with a weighted average of $z=3.65\pm0.07$. The
integrated far-IR-to-radio spectral energy distribution yields a total UV and
IR star formation rate ${\rm SFR}\approx 900~M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$. We also
estimated a halo mass of $\sim10^{13}~M_\odot$ for the structure, which at this
redshift is consistent with potential cold gas inflow. Remarkably, the most
massive member has a specific star formation rate and dust to stellar mass
ratio of $M_{\rm dust}/M_{*}$ that are both significantly lower than that of
star-forming galaxies at this redshift, suggesting that HPC1001 could be a
$z\approx3.7$ galaxy group in maturing phase. If confirmed, this would be the
earliest structure in maturing phase to date, and an ideal laboratory to study
the formation of the earliest quiescent galaxies as well as cold gas accretion
in dense environments.

reactions producing H$_2$. Our calculations indicate a valence bound state
($\pi^*_1$) and four resonances ($\pi^*_2$ to $\pi^*_5$) for that system. While
the computed thermodynamical thresholds are compatible with DEA reactions
producing H$_2$ at 0~eV, the well known mechanism involving vibrational
Feshbach resonances built on a dipole bound state should not be present in RV.
Our results suggest that the shallow $\pi^*_1$ valence bound state is expected
to account for H$_2$ elimination, probably involving
$\pi_1^*$/$\sigma_{\text{OH}}^*$ couplings along the vibration dynamics. The RS
molecule is also an oxidant and a subunit of RV. Since two close-lying hydroxyl
groups are found in the RS moiety, the H$_2$-elimination reaction in RV should
take place at the RS site. Our calculations point out a correspondence between
the anion states of RV and RS, and even between the thresholds. Nevertheless,
the absence of bound anion states in RS, indicated by our calculations, is
expected to suppress the H$_2$-formation channel at 0~eV. One is lead to
conclude that the ethene and phenol subunits in RV stabilize the $\pi^*_1$
state, thus switching on the DEA mechanism producing H$_2$.

automatic differentiation. First, we optimize the sensitivity of the wavefront
sensor for different apertures and wavefront distributions. We find sensors
that are more sensitive than currently used sensors and close to the
theoretical limit, under the assumption of monochromatic light. Subsequently,
we directly minimize the residual wavefront error by jointly optimizing the
sensing and reconstruction. This is done by connecting differentiable models of
the wavefront sensor and reconstructor and alternatingly improving them using a
gradient-based optimizer. We also allow for nonlinearities in the wavefront
reconstruction using Convolutional Neural Networks, which extends the design
space of the wavefront sensor. Our results show that optimization can lead to
wavefront sensors that have improved performance over currently used wavefront
sensors. The proposed approach is flexible, and can in principle be used for
any wavefront sensor architecture with free design parameters.

iteratively selects cover vertices into the result set. Based on this paradigm,

present integrated models to study the atmospheric responses and the underlying

general circulation models (GCMs) to establish the atmospheric thermal and

Based on the GCM output, we then adopted a 1D time-dependent photochemical

transition of the circulation patterns of HD 80606 b matched the dynamics
regimes in previous works. Our photochemical models show that efficient
vertical mixing leads to deep quench levels of the major carbon and nitrogen
species and the quenching behavior does not change throughout the eccentric
orbit. Instead, photolysis is the main driver of the time-dependent chemistry.
While CH$_4$ dominates over CO through most of the orbits, a transient state of

state-machine consumes input from the cascaded object detection and optical
character recognition(OCR) models for state transitions. We evaluated the
proposed method on 75 video clips of 285 vehicles from our system deployment

movement is restricted to follow a movement restrictions(SOP) at the checkpoint

corroborated, concerning both the character of the excitonic resonances as well
as their energy scale, by ab-initio \emph{GW} and Bethe-Salpeter equation

trade-off, we propose a novel uni-encoder ranking model, Sparse retriever using

binarization either causes sub-optimal computational efficiency or geometric

magnetization direction in the nanodiscs (e.g. by spin transfer torque) also
switches the helical rotation of the skyrmions from clockwise to anticlockwise

the sensitivity of the present search around $2 \times 10^{19}$ eV approaches

are routinely used to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity in
galaxies. Such ratios are, however, hard to interpret as they are highly
dependent on the physics and energetics of the gas, and hence can seldom be
used as a unique, unambiguous diagnostic. We used the composite galaxy NGC 1068
as a `laboratory' to investigate whether molecular line ratios between HCN,
HCO$^+$, and CS are useful tracers of AGN-dominated gas and determine the
origin of the differences in such ratios across different types of gas. Such a
determination will enable a more rigorous use of such ratios. First, we
empirically examined the aforementioned ratios at different angular resolutions
to quantify correlations. We then used local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)
and non-LTE analyses coupled with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling in
order to determine the origin of the underlying differences in ratios. We
propose that at high spatial resolution (< 50 pc) the HCN(4-3)/CS(2-1) is a
reliable tracer of AGN activity. We also find that the variations in ratios are
not a consequence of different densities or temperature but of different
fractional abundances, yielding to the important result that it is essential to
consider the chemical processes at play when drawing conclusions from radiative
transfer calculations. From analyses at varying spatial scales, we find that
previously proposed molecular line ratios, as well as a new one, have varying
levels of consistency. We also determine from an investigation of radiative
transfer modelling of our data that it is essential to consider the chemistry
of the species when reaching conclusions from radiative transfer calculations.

this issue. One effective way is to encode document positional information to
assist models in capturing cross-document relations. However, existing MDS
models, such as Transformer-based models, only consider token-level positional

Therefore, in this paper, we propose document-aware positional encoding and
linguistic-guided encoding that can be fused with Transformer architecture for
MDS. For document-aware positional encoding, we introduce a general protocol to

accretion in extreme gravity fields. We present a spectral-timing analysis of
observations taken with the Insight-HXMT mission, focusing on the
spectral-state dependent timing properties in the broad energy range of 1--150
keV, thus extending previous RXTE-based studies to both lower and higher
energies. Our main results are the following: a) We successfully use a simple
empirical model to fit all spectra, confirming that the reflection component is
stronger in the soft state than in the hard state; b) The evolution of the
total fractional root mean square (rms) depends on the selected energy band and
the spectral shape, which is a direct result of the evolution of the power
spectral densities (PSDs); c) In the hard/intermediate state, we see clear
short-term variability features and a positive correlation between central
frequencies of the variability components and the soft photon index $\Gamma_1$,
also at energies above 15 keV. The power spectrum is dominated by red noise in
the soft state instead. These behaviors can be traced to at least 90 keV; d)
The coherence and the phase-lag spectra show different behaviors dependent on
different spectral shapes.

  exciton-polaron formation in lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The microscopic origin of slow carrier cooling in lead-halide perovskites
remains debated, and has direct implications for applications. Slow carrier
cooling has been attributed to either polaron formation or a hot-phonon
bottleneck effect at high excited carrier densities (> 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$).
These effects cannot be unambiguously disentangled from optical experiments
alone. However, they can be distinguished by direct observations of ultrafast
lattice dynamics, as these effects are expected to create qualitatively
distinct fingerprints. To this end, we employ femtosecond electron diffraction
and directly measure the sub-picosecond lattice dynamics of weakly confined
CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals following above-gap photo-excitation. The data reveal a
light-induced structural distortion appearing on a time scale varying between
380 fs to 1200 fs depending on the excitation fluence. We attribute these
dynamics to the effect of exciton-polarons on the lattice, and the slower
dynamics at high fluences to slower hot carrier cooling, which slows down the
establishment of the exciton-polaron population. Further analysis and
simulations show that the distortion is consistent with motions of the
[PbBr$_3$]$^{-}$ octahedral ionic cage, and closest agreement with the data is
obtained for Pb-Br bond lengthening. Our work demonstrates how direct studies
of lattice dynamics on the sub-picosecond timescale can discriminate between
competing scenarios, thereby shedding light on the origin of slow carrier
cooling in lead-halide perovskites.

world requires rigorous testing to ensure safety. To increase trust, ADSs
should be tested on a large set of diverse road scenarios. Literature suggests
that if a vehicle is driven along a set of geometrically diverse roads-measured
using various diversity measures (DMs)-it will react in a wide range of
behaviours, thereby increasing the chances of observing failures (if any), or
strengthening the confidence in its safety, if no failures are observed. To the
best of our knowledge, however, this assumption has never been tested before,
nor have road DMs been assessed for their properties. Objective/Aim. Our goal
is to perform an exploratory study on 47 currently used and new, potentially
promising road DMs. Specifically, our research questions look into the road DMs
themselves, to analyse their properties (e.g. monotonicity, computation
efficiency), and to test correlation between DMs. Furthermore, we look at the
use of road DMs to investigate whether the assumption that diverse test suites
of roads expose diverse driving behaviour holds. Method. Our empirical analysis
relies on a state-of-the-art, open-source ADSs testing infrastructure and uses
a data set containing over 97,000 individual road geometries and matching
simulation data that were collected using two driving agents. By sampling
random test suites of various sizes and measuring their roads' geometric
diversity, we study road DMs properties, the correlation between road DMs, and
the correlation between road DMs and the observed behaviour.

feasibility of identifying such prompts based on the prompts themselves.
Motivated by this finding, we propose an early-rejection mechanism to turn down

black holes (PBHs) in the gravitational-wave (GW) events so far detected by

distribution. When deriving such population from first principles in the
standard scenario, however, the equation of state of the Universe at the time
of PBH formation may strongly affect the PBH abundance and mass distribution,
which ultimately depend on the power spectrum of cosmological perturbations.
Here we improve on previous population studies on several aspects: (i) we adopt
state-of-the-art PBH formation models describing the collapse of cosmological
perturbations across the QCD epoch; (ii) we perform the first Bayesian
multi-population inference on GW data including PBHs and directly using power
spectrum parameters instead of phenomenological distributions; (iii) we
critically confront the PBH scenario with LVK phenomenological models
describing the GWTC-3 catalog both in the neutron-star and in the BH mass
ranges, also considering PBHs as subpopulation of the total events. Our results
confirm that LVK observations prevent the majority of the dark matter to be in
the form of stellar mass PBHs. We find that the best fit PBH model can comprise
a small fraction of the total events, in particular it can naturally explain
events in the mass gaps. If the lower mass-gap event GW190814 is interpreted as
a PBH binary, we predict that LVK should detect up to a few subsolar mergers
and one to $\approx 30$ lower mass gap events during the upcoming O4 and O5
runs. Finally, mapping back the best-fit power spectrum into an ultra slow-roll
inflationary scenario, we show that the latter predicts detectable PBH mergers

instruments, and may include the entirety of dark matter in asteroid-mass PBHs.

implies asymptotic stability of the optimal steady state for a constant cost
function. For the case of an asymptotically stable closed loop, we first derive
a necessary condition for achieving bounded dynamic regret. Then, given some
additional assumptions on the system and the cost functions, we also provide a
sufficient condition ensuring bounded dynamic regret. Our results are
illustrated by examples.

DM cusps and cores: line-of-sight velocities and 2D spatial distributions of
their stars are used as inputs to obtain a PDF representing the probability of
predicting a specific inner slope. The model recovers accurately the expected
DM profiles: $\sim$82$\%$ of the galaxies have a derived inner slope within
$\pm$0.1 of their true value, while $\sim$98$\%$ within $\pm$0.3. We apply our
model to four Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies and find results consistent
with those obtained with the Jeans modelling based code GravSphere: the Fornax
dSph has a strong indication of possessing a central DM core, Carina and
Sextans have cusps (although the latter with large uncertainties), while
Sculptor shows a double peaked PDF indicating that a cusp is preferred, but a
core can not be ruled out. Our results show that simulation-based inference

suspensions have focused on the behaviours of swimmers in bulk flow and near
boundaries, models typically do not account for the interplay between bulk flow
and the choice of boundary conditions imposed in continuum models. In our work
we highlight the effect of boundary conditions on the bulk flow distributions,
such as through the development of boundary layers or secondary peaks of cell
accumulation in bulk-flow swimmer dynamics. For the case of a dilute swimmer
suspension in Poiseuille flow, we compare the distribution (in physical and
orientation space) obtained from continuum models with those obtained from
individual based stochastic models, and identify mathematically sensible
continuum boundary conditions for different physical scenarios. We identify
that the spread of preferred cell orientations is dependent on the interplay
between Jeffrey orbits and rotational diffusion. We further find that in the
absence of hydrodynamic wall-interactions, the preferred orientations of
swimmers at the walls are perpendicular to the walls in the presence of high
rotational diffusion, and are shape dependent at low rotational diffusion (when
suspensions tend towards a fully deterministic case). In the latter case, the
preferred orientations are nearly parallel to the surface for elongated
swimmers and nearly perpendicular to the surface for near-spherical swimmers.
Furthermore, we highlight the effects of swimmer geometries and shear
throughout the bulk-flow on swimmer trajectories and show how the full history
of bulk-flow dynamics affects the orientation distributions of micro-swimmer
wall incidence with varying magnitudes of rotational diffusion.

Here we quantify honeybee flight with time-resolved three-dimensional tracking
in calm conditions and controlled turbulent winds. We find that honeybee mean
speed and acceleration are only weakly correlated with the strength of
turbulence. In flight, honeybees accelerate slowly and decelerate rapidly,
i.e., they break suddenly during turns and then accelerate again. While this
behavior is observed in both calm and turbulent conditions, it is increasingly
dominant under turbulent conditions where short straight trajectories are
broken by turns and increased maneuvering. This flight-crash behavior is
reminiscent of turbulence itself. Our observations may help the development of
flight strategies for miniature flying robotics under turbulent conditions.

stage-wise chance-constrained problem into an unconstrained counterpart via
Lagrangian method, standard DP can then be deployed. Yet, for MWCC-OCP, this
methods fails to apply, because the mission-wide chance constraint cannot be
easily formulated using stage-wise chance constraints due to the
time-correlation between the latter (individual states are coupled through the
system dynamics). To fill this gap, firstly, we detail the conditions required

inter-satellite links, efficient routing in such highly dynamic space-borne
networks is becoming increasingly important. Due to the distinct network
topology, specifically tailored solutions are required. Firstly, the relative
movement of the constellation causes frequent handover events between the
satellites and the terminals on ground. Furthermore, unevenly distributed
traffic demands lead to geographical hot spots. The physical size of the
network also implies significant propagation delays. Therefore, monitoring the
dynamic topology changes and link loads on a network-wide basis for routing
purposes is typically impractical with massive signaling overhead. To address
these issues, we propose a distributed load-balanced routing scheme based on
Software Defined Networking. The approach divides the large-scale network into
sub-sections, called clusters. In order to minimize signaling overhead, packets
are forwarded between these clusters according to geographical heuristics.
Within each cluster active Quality of Service-aware load-balancing is applied.
The responsible on-board network controller forwards routing instructions based
on the network state information in its cluster. We also analyze specific
design choices for the clusters and the interfaces between them. The protocol

highly challenging task, given the many thousands of possible skill labels

finely annotated training corpora. Previous work on skill extraction overly
simplifies the task to an explicit entity detection task or builds on manually

appear in two possible configurations. These models are fundamental in the
mathematical treatment of a number of phenomena such as spin interactions in
magnetism, opinion dynamics, rumor and information spreading in social systems,
etc. Here, we focus on the study of non-Markovian effects associated with aging
for binary-state dynamics in complex networks. Aging is considered as the
property of the agents to be less prone to change state the longer they have
been in the current state, which gives rise to heterogeneous activity patterns.
We analyze in this context the Threshold model of Complex Contagion, which has
been proposed to explain, for instance, processes of adoption of new
technologies and in which the agents need the reiterated confirmation of
several contacts (until reaching over a given neighbor fraction threshold) to
change state. Our analytical approximations give a good description of
extensive numerical simulations in Erd\""os-R\'enyi, random-regular and
Barab\'asi-Albert networks. While aging does not modify the spreading
condition, it slows down the cascade dynamics towards the full-adoption state:
the exponential increase of adopters in time from the original model is
replaced by a stretched exponential or power-law, depending on the aging
mechanism. Under several approximations, we give analytical expressions for the
cascade condition and for the exponents of the exponential, power-law and
stretched exponential growth laws for the adopters density. Beyond networks, we
also describe by numerical simulations the effects of aging for the Threshold
model in a two-dimensional lattice.

lattices. We encountered three different scenarios of the pumping: quasi-linear
one occurring for gradually dispersing wave packets, transport carried by a
single two-dimensional soliton, and multi-soliton regime when initial wave
packet splits into several solitons. The scenario to be realized depends on the
number of atoms in the initial wave packet and on the strength of the two-body
interactions. The magnitude and direction of the displacement of a wavepacket
are determined by Chern numbers of the populated energy bands and by the
inter-band transitions induced by two-body interactions. As a case example we
explore a separable potential created by optical lattices whose constitutive
sublattices undergo relative motion in the orthogonal directions. For such
potentials, obeying parity-time symmetry, fractional Chern numbers, computed
over half period of the evolution, acquire relevance. We focus mainly on
solitonic scenarios, showing that one-soliton pumping occurs at relatively
small as well as at sufficiently large amplitudes of the initial wavepacket,
while at intermediate amplitudes the transport is multi-solitonic. We also
describe peculiarities of the pumping characterized by two different
commensurate periods of the modulations of the lattices in the orthogonal

representativeness of the available shots of the data space. Particularly in
the field of network neuroscience where the brain is represented as a graph,
such models may lead to low performance when classifying brain states (e.g.,
typical vs. autistic). To cope with this, most of the existing works involve a
data augmentation step to increase the size of the training set, its diversity
and representativeness. Though effective, such augmentation methods are limited
to generating samples with the same size as the input shots (e.g., generating
brain connectivity matrices from a single shot matrix). To the best of our
knowledge, the problem of generating brain multigraphs capturing multiple types
of connectivity between pairs of nodes (i.e., anatomical regions) from a single
brain graph remains unsolved. In this paper, we unprecedentedly propose a
hybrid graph neural network (GNN) architecture, namely Multigraph Generator
Network or briefly MultigraphGNet, comprising two subnetworks: (1) a
many-to-one GNN which integrates an input population of brain multigraphs into
a single template graph, namely a connectional brain temple (CBT), and (2) a
reverse one-to-many U-Net network which takes the learned CBT in each training
step and outputs the reconstructed input multigraph population. Both networks
are trained in an end-to-end way using a cyclic loss. Experimental results
demonstrate that our MultigraphGNet boosts the performance of an independent
classifier when trained on the augmented brain multigraphs in comparison with
training on a single CBT from each class. We hope that our framework can shed
some light on the future research of multigraph augmentation from a single
graph. Our MultigraphGNet source code is available at

conventional BitCom-based NOMA is provided as the baseline scheme. It unveils
that, compared to BitCom, SemCom can significantly improve the F-user's
performance when its permitted transmit power is strictly capped, but may
perform worse when its permitted transmit power is high. Guided by this result,
the proposed semantics-empowered NOMA framework is investigated over fading
channels. An opportunistic SemCom and BitCom scheme is proposed, which enables
the secondary F-user to participate in NOMA via the most suitable communication
method at each fading state, thus striking a good tradeoff between its own
achieved performance and the interference imposed to the primary N-user. Two
scenarios are considered for employing the opportunistic scheme, namely on-off
resource management and continuous resource management. For each scenario, the
optimal communication policy over fading channels is derived for maximizing the
ergodic semantic rate achieved at the secondary F-user, subject to the minimum
ergodic bit rate constraint of the primary N-user. Numerical results show that
the proposed opportunistic scheme in both scenarios can achieve higher

candidates' luminosities and sizes are similar to known Local Group dwarf
galaxies Tucana B, Canes Venatici I, Hercules, and Bo\""otes I. Most of these
candidates are likely to be real, based on tests of our techniques on blank

NGC 3077, which is itself an M81 group satellite in an advanced state of tidal
disruption. This is somewhat surprising, as M81 itself and its largest

increase the gripping force -- the max gripping force is already applied or
(ii) increased force damages the grasped object, such as soft fruit. Moreover,
the robot fixes the gripping force when it forms a stable grasp on the surface

not be an effective control policy. We propose a novel control approach to slip
avoidance including a learned action-conditioned slip predictor and a
constrained optimiser avoiding a predicted slip given a desired robot action.
We show the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory adaptation method with
receding horizon controller with a series of real-robot test cases. Our

of the NIS junction is an oscillatory function of the effective barrier
potential ($\chi$) of the insulating region upto a thin barrier limit. The
periodicity and the amplitudes of the oscillations largely depend on the values
of $\alpha$ and the gate voltage of the superconducting region, namely, $U_0$.
Further, the periodicity of the oscillation changes from $\pi$ to $\pi/2$ as we
increase $U_0$. To assess the thermoelectric performance of such a junction, we
have computed the Seebeck coefficient, the thermoelectric figure of merit,
maximum power output, efficiency at the maximum output power of the system, and
the thermoelectric cooling of the NIS junction as a self-cooling device. Our
results on the thermoelectric cooling indicate practical realizability and
usefulness for using our system as efficient cooling detectors, sensors, etc.,
and hence could be crucial to the experimental success of the thermoelectric
applications of such junction devices. Furthermore, for an $\alpha-T_3$
lattice, whose limiting cases denote a graphene or a dice lattice, it is
interesting to ascertain which one is more suitable as a thermoelectric device
and the answer seems to depend on the $U_0$. We observe that for an
$\alpha-T_3$ lattice corresponding to $U_0=0$, graphene ($\alpha=0$) is more
feasible for constructing a thermoelectric device, whereas for $U_0 \gg E_F$,
the dice lattice ($\alpha=1$) has a larger utility.

critical unsolved problem: investigating the reproducibility of the most
discriminative biomarkers (i.e., features) selected by the GNN models within a
federated learning paradigm. Quantifying the reproducibility of a predictive
medical model against perturbations of training and testing data distributions
presents one of the biggest hurdles to overcome in developing translational
clinical applications. To the best of our knowledge, this presents the first
work investigating the reproducibility of federated GNN models with application
to classifying medical imaging and brain connectivity datasets. We evaluated
our framework using various GNN models trained on medical imaging and

Galerkin orthogonality is an issue that prevents solving the dual equation in
the same space as the one for the primal equation. In the literature, there
have been two popular approaches to constructing a new space for the dual
problem, i.e., refining mesh grids ($h$-approach) and raising the order of
approximate polynomials ($p$-approach). In this paper, a novel approach is
proposed for the purpose based on the multiple-precision technique, i.e., the
construction of the new finite element space is based on the same configuration
as the one for the primal equation, except for the precision in calculations.
The feasibility of such a new approach is discussed in detail in the paper. In
numerical experiments, the proposed approach can be realized conveniently with
C++ \textit{template}. Moreover, the new approach shows remarkable improvements
in both efficiency and storage compared with the $h$-approach and the
$p$-approach. It is worth mentioning that the performance of our approach is
comparable with the one through a higher order interpolation ($i$-approach) in

enhance the efficiency of the dual weighted residual method.

functions of galaxies, $\xi(r)$, using dark matter particles of the biased

properties of the evolving cosmic web. We find that for all cosmic epochs the
bias parameter, defined through the ratio of correlation functions of selected
samples and matter, depends on two factors: the fraction of matter in voids and
in the clustered population, and the luminosity (mass) of galaxy samples.
Gravity cannot evacuate voids completely, thus there is always some unclustered
matter in voids, thus the bias parameter of galaxies is always greater than
unity, over the whole range of evolution epochs. We find that for all cosmic
epochs bias parameter values form regular sequences, depending on galaxy
luminosity (particle density limit), and decreasing with time.

  Random Bits",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the basic question of how strong of a probabilistic
guarantee can a hash table, storing $n$ $(1 + \Theta(1)) \log n$-bit key/value
pairs, offer? Past work on this question has been bottlenecked by limitations
of the known families of hash functions: The only hash tables to achieve
failure probabilities less than $1 / 2^{\polylog n}$ require access to
fully-random hash functions -- if the same hash tables are implemented using
the known explicit families of hash functions, their failure probabilities
become $1 / \poly(n)$.
  To get around these obstacles, we show how to construct a randomized data
structure that has the same guarantees as a hash table, but that \emph{avoids
the direct use of hash functions}. Building on this, we are able to construct a
hash table using $O(n)$ random bits that achieves failure probability $1 /
n^{n^{1 - \epsilon}}$ for an arbitrary positive constant $\epsilon$.
  In fact, we show that this guarantee can even be achieved by a \emph{succinct
dictionary}, that is, by a dictionary that uses space within a $1 + o(1)$
factor of the information-theoretic optimum.
  Finally we also construct a succinct hash table whose probabilistic
guarantees fall on a different extreme, offering a failure probability of $1 /
\poly(n)$ while using only $\tilde{O}(\log n)$ random bits. This latter result
matches (up to low-order terms) a guarantee previously achieved by
Dietzfelbinger et al., but with increased space efficiency and with several
surprising technical components.

dynamic multi-scale network, named DMTNet, for dual-pixel images defocus
deblurring. DMTNet mainly contains two modules: feature extraction module and
reconstruction module. The feature extraction module is composed of several
vision transformer blocks, which uses its powerful feature extraction
capability to obtain richer features and improve the robustness of the model.
The reconstruction module is composed of several Dynamic Multi-scale
Sub-reconstruction Module (DMSSRM). DMSSRM can restore images by adaptively
assigning weights to features from different scales according to the blur
distribution and content information of the input images. DMTNet combines the
advantages of transformer and CNN, in which the vision transformer improves the
performance ceiling of CNN, and the inductive bias of CNN enables transformer
to extract more robust features without relying on a large amount of data.
DMTNet might be the first attempt to use vision transformer to restore the
blurring images to clarity. By combining with CNN, the vision transformer may
achieve better performance on small datasets. Experimental results on the
popular benchmarks demonstrate that our DMTNet significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

updating, inspections, and monitoring. Robust localization is a critical
enabler for reliable deployments of autonomous robotic platforms. Automated
robotic solutions rely mainly on the global positioning system (GPS) for
outdoor localization. However, GPS signals are denied indoors, and pre-built
environment maps are often used for indoor localization. This entails
generating high-quality maps by teleoperating the mobile robot in the
environment. Not only is this approach time-consuming and tedious, but it also
is unreliable in indoor construction settings. Layout changes with construction
progress, requiring frequent mapping sessions to support autonomous missions.
Moreover, the effectiveness of vision-based solutions relying on visual
features is highly impacted in low texture and repetitive areas on site. To
address these challenges, we previously proposed a low-cost, lightweight
tag-based visual-inertial localization method using AprilTags. Tags, in this
method, are paper printable landmarks with known sizes and locations,
representing the environment's quasi-map. Since tag placement/replacement is a
manual process, it is subject to human errors. In this work, we study the
impact of human error in the manual tag installation process and propose a
stochastic approach to account for this uncertainty using the Lie group theory.
Employing Monte Carlo simulation, we experimentally show that the proposed
stochastic model incorporated in our on-manifold formulation improves the
robustness and accuracy of tag-based localization against inevitable
imperfections in manual tag installation on site.

the accuracy of the fits on macroscopic parameters. We provide the polytropes
parameters for 15 nucleonic relativistic mean field models, seven hyperonic

the music industry, such as music education and live performances. However,
automatic real-time music accompaniment generation is still understudied and
often faces a trade-off between logical latency and exposure bias. In this
paper, we propose SongDriver, a real-time music accompaniment generation system
without logical latency nor exposure bias. Specifically, SongDriver divides one
accompaniment generation task into two phases: 1) The arrangement phase, where
a Transformer model first arranges chords for input melodies in real-time, and
caches the chords for the next phase instead of playing them out. 2) The
prediction phase, where a CRF model generates playable multi-track
accompaniments for the coming melodies based on previously cached chords. With
this two-phase strategy, SongDriver directly generates the accompaniment for
the upcoming melody, achieving zero logical latency. Furthermore, when
predicting chords for a timestep, SongDriver refers to the cached chords from
the first phase rather than its previous predictions, which avoids the exposure
bias problem. Since the input length is often constrained under real-time
conditions, another potential problem is the loss of long-term sequential
information. To make up for this disadvantage, we extract four musical features
from a long-term music piece before the current time step as global
information. In the experiment, we train SongDriver on some open-source
datasets and an original \`aiSong Dataset built from Chinese-style modern pop
music scores. The results show that SongDriver outperforms existing SOTA
(state-of-the-art) models on both objective and subjective metrics, meanwhile
significantly reducing the physical latency.

  prediction scheme","Submitted to Frontiers",,,,"physics.ao-ph math.DS math.PR nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Transition Path Theory (TPT) of complex systems has proven a robust means
for statistically characterizing the ensemble of trajectories that connect any
two preset flow regions, say $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$, directly. More
specifically, transition paths are such that they start in $\mathcal A$ and
then go to $\mathcal B$ without detouring back to $\mathcal A$ or $\mathcal B$.
This way, they make an effective contribution to the transport from $\mathcal
A$ to $\mathcal B$. Here, we explore its use for building a scheme that enables
predicting the evolution of an oil spill in the ocean. This involves
appropriately adapting TPT such that it includes a reservoir that pumps oil
into a typically open domain. Additionally, we lift up the restriction of the
oil not to return to the spill site en route to a region that there is interest
to be protected. TPT is applied on oil trajectories available up to the
present, e.g., as integrated using velocities produced by a data assimilative
system or as inferred from high-frequency radars, to make a prediction of
transition oil paths beyond, without relying on forecasted oil trajectories. As
a proof of concept we consider a hypothetical oil spill in the Trion oil field,
under development within the Perdido Foldbelt in the northwestern Gulf of
Mexico, and the \emph{Deepwater Horizon} oil spill. This is done using
trajectories integrated from climatological and hindcast surface velocity and
winds as well as produced by satellite-tracked surface drifting buoys, in each
case discretized into a Markov chain that provides a framework for the
TPT-based prediction.

cloud (parsec-) scales to kiloparsec scales in a complete region within the
Milky Way disk. We utilise the census of molecular clouds within 2 kpc from our

study the kinematics and the Larson's relations for the sample of individual
clouds. We also mimic a face-on view of the Milky Way and analyse the

we describe the scale-dependency of the CO gas kinematics and Larson's
relations. We describe the spectra of CO gas at cloud scales and in apertures
between 0.25-2 kpc in our survey area. The spectra within the apertures are
relatively symmetric but show non-Gaussian high-velocity wings. At
cloud-scales, our sample shows a linewidth-size relation
\sigma_v=1.5*R^{0.3\pm0.1} with a large scatter. The mass-size relation in the
sample of clouds is M_{CO}= 794*R^{1.5\pm0.5}. The relations are also present
for the apertures at kpc-scales. A suggestive dependency on galactic
environment is seen, with apertures closer to the Galactic centre and the
Sagittarius spiral arm having slightly higher velocity dispersions. We explore
the possible effect of a diffuse component in the survey area, and find that
such a component would widen the CO spectra and could flatten the
linewidth-size relation. Understanding the nature of the possible diffuse CO
component and its effects on observations is crucial for connecting Galactic

the near-infrared (IR) where we expect to see the dust sublimation region and
the nucleus directly without obscuration. Here we present the near-IR
interferometric observation of the brightest Type 1 AGN NGC4151 at long
baselines of ~250 m using the CHARA Array, reaching structures at hundred
micro-arcsecond scales. The squared visibilities decrease down to as low as
~0.25, definitely showing that the structure is resolved. Furthermore,
combining with the previous visibility measurements at shorter baselines but at
different position angles, we show that the structure is elongated
*perpendicular* to the polar axis of the nucleus, as defined by optical
polarization and a linear radio jet. A thin-ring fit gives a minor/major axis
ratio of ~0.7 at a radius ~0.5 mas (~0.03 pc). This is consistent with the case
where the sublimating dust grains are distributed preferentially in an
equatorial plane in a ring-like geometry, viewed at an inclination angle of ~40
deg. Recent mid-IR interferometric finding of polar-elongated geometry at a pc
scale, together with a larger-scale polar outflow as spectrally resolved by the
HST, would generally suggest a dusty, conical and hollow outflow being launched
presumably in the dust sublimation region. This might potentially lead to a
polar-elongated morphology in the near-IR, as opposed to the results here. We
discuss a possible scenario where an episodic, one-off anisotropic acceleration
formed a polar-fast and equatorially-slow velocity distribution, having lead to
an effectively flaring geometry as we observe.

Waveguides, owing to their tightly spatial confinement of the electromagnetic

the efficient feeding of the sub-ps THz pulse to the waveguides remains
challenging due to the ultra-wide bandwidth property of the ultrafast signal.

grasps the crop and detaches it, either via a detachment movement, or by
cutting its stem with a specially designed gripper/cutter end-effector.
However, such unimanual solutions cannot be applied for sensitive crops and
cluttered environments like grapes and a vineyard where obstacles may occlude
the stem and leave no space for the cutter's placement. In such cases, the
solution would require a bimanual robot in order to visually unveil the stem
and manipulate the grasped crop to create cutting affordances which is similar
to the practice used by humans. In this work, a dual-arm coordinated motion
control methodology for reaching a stem pre-cut state is proposed. The camera
equipped arm with the cutter is reaching the stem, unveiling it as much as
possible, while the second arm is moving the grasped crop towards the
surrounding free-space to facilitate its stem cutting. Lab experimentation on a
mock-up vine setup with a plastic grape cluster evaluates the proposed
methodology, involving two UR5e robotic arms and a RealSense D415 camera.

vital for high-risk applications. Unfortunately, modern deep neural networks
are poorly calibrated, compromising trustworthiness and reliability. Medical
image segmentation particularly suffers from this due to the natural
uncertainty of tissue boundaries. This is exasperated by their loss functions,
which favor overconfidence in the majority classes. We address these challenges
with DOMINO, a domain-aware model calibration method that leverages the
semantic confusability and hierarchical similarity between class labels. Our
experiments demonstrate that our DOMINO-calibrated deep neural networks
outperform non-calibrated models and state-of-the-art morphometric methods in
head image segmentation. Our results show that our method can consistently
achieve better calibration, higher accuracy, and faster inference times than
these methods, especially on rarer classes. This performance is attributed to
our domain-aware regularization to inform semantic model calibration. These
findings show the importance of semantic ties between class labels in building
confidence in deep learning models. The framework has the potential to improve
the trustworthiness and reliability of generic medical image segmentation

On the other hand, the combination of both functions has also been successfully
applied in this kind of tasks. A much less studied problem is the
generalization ability of all these losses in the presence of
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data. This refers to samples appearing in test time
that are drawn from a different distribution than training images. In our case,
we train our models on images that always contain lesions, but in test time we
also have lesion-free samples. We analyze the impact of the minimization of
different loss functions on in-distribution performance, but also its ability
to generalize to OoD data, via comprehensive experiments on polyp segmentation
from endoscopic images and ulcer segmentation from diabetic feet images. Our
findings are surprising: CE-Dice loss combinations that excel in segmenting
in-distribution images have a poor performance when dealing with OoD data,
which leads us to recommend the adoption of the CE loss for this kind of

considered as one of the basic problem in metamaterial science. At present,
special subwavelength resonators are considered as structural elements in

small scatterers behave like ""artificial atoms"", meta-atoms, with strong
electrical and magnetic responses and an interconnection between these
responses. However, the observed effect of magnetoelectric (ME) coupling in
these meta-atoms is not associated with the near-field manipulation properties
caused by intrinsic magnetoelectricity. This arises the question whether ME
point scatterers of EM radiation really exist. In this paper, we show that
there are mesoscopic structures with electric and magnetic dipole-carrying
excitations that behave like point scatterers with their inherent
magnetoelectricity. In such subwavelength resonators, coherent oscillations of
the electric polarization and magnetization can be considered as quasistatic
oscillations described by electrostatic (ES) and magnetostatic (MS) scalar wave
functions. The ME resonance effect arises from the coupling of two, ES and MS,
oscillations. The near fields of these resonators, called the ME near fields,
are characterized by simultaneous violation of time reversal and inversion
symmetry. In study of ME fields and EM problems associated with these fields,
we put forward the concept of ME-field electrodynamics. Like the axion-field
electrodynamics and the axion-polariton problem, we are talking about modified
Maxwell equations with a presudoscalar source terms and the quantum field
theory for massive particles. While the axion fields are boson scalar fields,
the ME fields are fermionic fields. These fields are characterized by energy

temperature sensor. It is an adaption of state-of-the-art metallic magnetic
calorimeters (MMCs) that are meanwhile a key technology for high resolution
$\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and X-ray spectroscopy as well as the study of
neutrino mass. The effort to adapt MMCs for CMB surveys is triggered by their
lack of Johnson noise associated with the detector readout, the possibility of
straightforward calibration and higher dynamic range given it possesses a broad
and smooth responsivity dependence with temperature and the absence of Joule
dissipation which simplifies the thermal design. A brief proof of concept case
study is analyzed, taking into account typical constraints in CMB measurements
and reliable microfabrication processes. The results show that MMBs provide a
promising technology for CMB polarization survey as their sensitivity can be
tuned for background limited detection of the sky while simultaneously
maintaining a low time response to avoid distortion of the point-source
response of the telescope. As the sensor technology and its fabrication
techniques are compatible with TES based bolometric detector arrays, a change
of detector technology would even come with very low cost.

(NIR) photoswitching of avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs), showing full optical

photodarkening10-13 and photobrightening12,14-18, we demonstrate indefinite
photoswitching of individual nanoparticles (>1000 cycles over 7 h) in ambient

the photoswitching mechanism are elucidated by modeling and by measuring the
photon avalanche properties of single ANPs in both bright and dark states.
Unlimited, reversible photoswitching of ANPs enables indefinitely rewritable 2D

with sub-{\AA} localization superresolution that allows us to distinguish
individual ANPs within tightly packed clusters.

estimates in the development data were effective on average, they had a high
variance across replications that limits their accuracy in any particular

validated in external data rather than in the original development sample.

multidisciplinary team working together in a high take environment to provide

Many factors can therefore contribute to increasing the Cognitive Workload
(CWL) such as temporal pressures, unfamiliar anatomy or distractions in the OR.
In this paper, a cascade of two machine learning approaches is suggested for
the multimodal recognition of CWL in four different surgical task conditions.
Firstly, a model based on the concept of transfer learning is used to identify
if a surgeon is experiencing any CWL. Secondly, a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) uses this information to identify different degrees of CWL associated to
each surgical task. The suggested multimodal approach considers adjacent
signals from electroencephalogram (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy

correlations in terms of time (temporal) and channel location (spatial). Data
collection was performed by a Multi-sensing AI Environment for Surgical Task &

heterogeneous gap between multi-modal data. Many previous approaches contrive
to learning a latent common manifold mapping paradigm following a
\textbf{cross-modal distribution consensus prediction (CDCP)} manner. When
mapping features from distribution of one certain modality into the common
manifold, feature distribution of the opposite modality is completely
invisible. That is to say, how to achieve a cross-modal distribution consensus
so as to embed and align the multi-modal features in a constructed cross-modal
common manifold all depends on the experience of the model itself, instead of
the actual situation. With such methods, it is inevitable that the multi-modal
data can not be well aligned in the common manifold, which finally leads to a
sub-optimal retrieval performance. To overcome this \textbf{CDCP dilemma}, we
propose a novel algorithm termed LBUL to learn a Consistent Cross-modal Common
Manifold (C$^{3}$M) for text-based person retrieval. The core idea of our
method, just as a Chinese saying goes, is to `\textit{san si er hou xing}',
namely, to \textbf{Look Before yoU Leap (LBUL)}. The common manifold mapping
mechanism of LBUL contains a looking step and a leaping step. Compared to
CDCP-based methods, LBUL considers distribution characteristics of both the
visual and textual modalities before embedding data from one certain modality
into C$^{3}$M to achieve a more solid cross-modal distribution consensus, and
hence achieve a superior retrieval accuracy. We evaluate our proposed method on
two text-based person retrieval datasets CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed LBUL outperforms previous methods and
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

By considering all experiments performed so far, from Michelson-Morley to the
present experiments with optical resonators, and analyzing the small observed
residuals in a modern theoretical framework, the long sought $\Sigma-$ frame
tight to the CMB naturally emerges. Finally, if quantum non-locality reflects
some effect propagating at vastly superluminal speed $v_{QI} \to \infty $, its

are based on an invalid mathematical foundation. Consequently, these metrics,
which produce reasonable values for many pitchers, can be substantially
inaccurate for some. Specifically, FanGraphs and Baseball Reference compute a
pitcher's WAR as a function of his performance averaged over the entire season.
This is wrong because WAR must be a convex function of the number of runs
allowed by the pitcher in a game. Hence we propose a new way to compute WAR for
starting pitchers: Grid WAR (GWAR). The idea is to compute a starter's GWAR for
each of his individual games, and define a starter's seasonal GWAR as the sum
of the GWAR of each of his games. We show that GWAR is indeed a convex function
in the number of runs allowed during a game. As such, GWAR accounts for a
fundamental baseball principle that not all runs allowed have the same impact
in determining the outcome of a game: for instance, the difference in GWAR
between allowing 1 run in a game instead of 0 is much greater than the
difference in GWAR between allowing 6 runs in a game instead of 5. Moreover,
Jensen's inequality implies that, by ignoring the convexity of WAR, current
implementations of WAR undervalue certain pitchers, particularly those who
allow few runs (specifically, 0 or 1 run) in many games. It also unfairly
penalizes pitchers who are credited with a large number of runs in a short
outing. These flaws are corrected by GWAR.

cosmic history, haloes often collided and merged, forming bigger and bigger
structures. Merger trees, i.e., catalogues of haloes evolving and connections
between them as they grow and merge, have become a vital tool in describing and
understanding the history of cosmological objects such as our Galaxy.
Semi-analytical models, built on top of such merger trees, are a common
approach for theoretical studies in cosmology. The semi-analytical nature of
such models is especially beneficial when the dynamic range in spatial and time
scales that need to be considered becomes too large for numerical simulations.
Ancient Stars and Local Observables by Tracing Halos (A-SLOTH) is such a
semi-analytical model and it is designed to simulate star formation in the
early Universe in a fast and accessible way. It uses merger trees, either from
numerical simulations or generated by statistical algorithms to describe the
history of galaxies. The processes of baryonic physics, in particular gas
cooling, star formation and stellar feedback are described with approximations

underlying compression algorithm to directly process the images in their

seismological-theory-based relationships for the average displacement scaling
and the aid of dynamic fault rupture simulations to constrain the rupture width
scaling. The empirical dataset used in the development of this relationship is
composed of $123$ events ranging from $\mathbf{M}~5$ to $8.1$ and $SRL~1.1$ to
$432~km$. The dynamic rupture simulations dataset includes $554$ events ranging
from $\mathbf{M}~4.9$ to $8.2$ and $SRL~1$ to $655~km$. For the average
displacement ($\bar{D}$) scaling, three simple models and two composite models
were evaluated. The simple average displacement models were: a square root of
the rupture area ($\sqrt{A}$), a down-dip width ($W$), and a rupture length
($L$) proportional model. The two composite models followed a $\sqrt{A}$
scaling for unbounded ruptures and transitioned to $W$ and $L$ scaling for
width-limited events, respectively. The empirical data favors a $\bar{D} \sim
\sqrt{A}$ scaling for both unbounded and width-limited ruptures. The proposed
model exhibits better predictive performance compared to linear
$\log(SLR)\sim\mathbf{M}$ type models, especially in the large magnitude range,
which is dominated by width-limited events. A comparison with existing $SRL$
models shows consistent scaling at different magnitude ranges that is believed

options available today. Effective treatment requires early diagnosis, which is
difficult to achieve with existing imaging technologies that detect the already
inflicted irreversible posterior eye damage. One improved approach could be to
detect the changes in trabecular meshwork of the anterior eye that precede the
intraocular pressure buildup and vision loss. Here we report a device that
enables in vivo exploration of trabecular meshwork at cell resolution. The
instrument combines two orthogonal views: en face view of time-domain
full-field OCT for high-resolution and cross-sectional view of spectral-domain
OCT for aligning to the meshwork. The device resolves micron-level
corneoscleral and uveal pores, meshwork beams and internal elastic fibers,
ciliary body tendons and trabecular cell nuclei. Capable of detecting blockage
of trabecular pores, orthogonal view OCT presents a promising solution to the
long-standing problem of early glaucoma diagnosis. Future clinical adoption of
the device is facilitated by the compact footprint and broad functionality that
includes corneal imaging in healthy subjects and patients (with keratoconus,
Fuchs endothelial dystrophy) using the same design.

not believed to be a theory of everything. Many extensions of the Standard
Model predict the existence of new particles. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
is a high energy proton-proton collider which may be able to produce such
particles. In this work strategies have been developed to search for new
physics by identifying high energy electrons produced by the decay of W boson
using 2.8 pb-1 of real data. The electron identification for CMS has been
presented. Simple cut based selections and a complete set of variables to
distinguish between real electrons and background electrons are described. The
detection of electrons is of particular importance at LHC as these particles
intervene in the flagship H -> ZZ* -> 4e and H -> WW* -> 2e2v channels for the
search of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs. Electrons are also important in many
SUSY scenarios as produced in the leptonic decays of charginos and neutralinos.
Electrons also appears in searches for TeV resonances that may come from new
symmetries or as consequences of scenarios involving extra spatial dimensions.
Last but not the least, electrons appear in the final state of many Standard
Model processes involving top quarks or electroweak bosons, that constitute
backgrounds to new signals or are intended to be used as calibration processes.
In second part of my thesis background sources for electrons coming from W
bosons have been studied. Electron identification variables are plotted in
different regions of background, to study the background as deeply as possible.
This work has been done for the first time using LHC's real data.

moved to online or distance learning. Online learning requires a
personalization method because the interaction between learners and instructors
is minimal, and learners have a specific learning method that works best for
them. One of the personalization methods is detecting the learners' learning
style. To detect learning styles, several works have been proposed using
classification techniques. However, the current detection models become
ineffective when learners have no dominant style or a mix of learning styles.
Thus, the objective of this study is twofold. Firstly, constructing a
prediction model based on regression analysis provides a probabilistic approach
for inferring the preferred learning style. Secondly, comparing regression
models and classification models for detecting learning style. To ground our
conceptual model, a set of machine learning algorithms have been implemented
based on a dataset collected from a sample of 72 students using visual,
auditory, reading/writing, and kinesthetic (VARK's) inventory questionnaire.
Results show that regression techniques are more accurate and representative
for real-world scenarios than classification algorithms, where students might
have multiple learning styles but with different probabilities. We believe that
this research will help educational institutes to engage learning styles in the
teaching process.

It has many application areas such as; virtual reality (VR), augmented reality

synthesis and style transfer using deep learning and generative modelling, due
to the complex nature of hair still contains unsolved challenges. The methods
proposed in the literature to solve this problem generally focus on making
high-quality hair edits on images. In this thesis, a generative adversarial
network method is proposed to solve the hair synthesis problem. While
developing this method, it is aimed to achieve real-time hair synthesis while
achieving visual outputs that compete with the best methods in the literature.
The proposed method was trained with the FFHQ dataset and then its results in
hair style transfer and hair reconstruction tasks were evaluated. The results
obtained in these tasks and the operating time of the method were compared with
MichiGAN, one of the best methods in the literature. The comparison was made at

prioritizing the content available online, they have a growing impact on the
opportunities or revenue of their items producers. For instance, they influence
which recruiter a resume is recommended to, or to whom and how much a music
track, video or news article is being exposed. This calls for recommendation
approaches that not only maximize (a proxy of) user satisfaction, but also
consider some notion of fairness in the exposure of items or groups of items.
Formally, such recommendations are usually obtained by maximizing a concave
objective function in the space of randomized rankings. When the total exposure
of an item is defined as the sum of its exposure over users, the optimal
rankings of every users become coupled, which makes the optimization process
challenging. Existing approaches to find these rankings either solve the global
optimization problem in a batch setting, i.e., for all users at once, which
makes them inapplicable at scale, or are based on heuristics that have weak
theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose the first efficient online
algorithm to optimize concave objective functions in the space of rankings
which applies to every concave and smooth objective function, such as the ones
found for fairness of exposure. Based on online variants of the Frank-Wolfe
algorithm, we show that our algorithm is computationally fast, generating
rankings on-the-fly with computation cost dominated by the sort operation,
memory efficient, and has strong theoretical guarantees. Compared to baseline
policies that only maximize user-side performance, our algorithm allows to
incorporate complex fairness of exposure criteria in the recommendations with
negligible computational overhead.

The framework infers a desired chemical graph by solving a mixed integer linear
program (MILP) that simulates the computation process of a feature function
defined by a two-layered model on chemical graphs and a prediction function
constructed by a machine learning method. A set of graph theoretical
descriptors in the feature function plays a key role to derive a compact

functions in the framework maintaining the compactness of the MILP, this paper
utilizes the product of two of those descriptors as a new descriptor and then
designs a method of reducing the number of descriptors. The results of our

learning performance for many chemical properties and can infer a chemical
structure with up to 50 non-hydrogen atoms.

individuals of a given population of brain connectomes, thereby acting as a
fingerprint. Estimating a CBT from a population where brain graphs are derived
from diverse neuroimaging modalities (e.g., functional and structural) and at
different resolutions (i.e., number of nodes) remains a formidable challenge to
solve. Such network integration task allows for learning a rich and universal
representation of the brain connectivity across varying modalities and
resolutions. The resulting CBT can be substantially used to generate entirely
new multimodal brain connectomes, which can boost the learning of the
downs-stream tasks such as brain state classification. Here, we propose the
Multimodal Multiresolution Brain Graph Integrator Network (i.e.,
M2GraphIntegrator), the first multimodal multiresolution graph integration
framework that maps a given connectomic population into a well centered CBT.
M2GraphIntegrator first unifies brain graph resolutions by utilizing
resolution-specific graph autoencoders. Next, it integrates the resulting
fixed-size brain graphs into a universal CBT lying at the center of its
population. To preserve the population diversity, we further design a novel
clustering-based training sample selection strategy which leverages the most
heterogeneous training samples. To ensure the biological soundness of the
learned CBT, we propose a topological loss that minimizes the topological gap
between the ground-truth brain graphs and the learned CBT. Our experiments show
that from a single CBT, one can generate realistic connectomic datasets
including brain graphs of varying resolutions and modalities. We further
demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms benchmarks in
reconstruction quality, augmentation task, centeredness and topological
soundness.
