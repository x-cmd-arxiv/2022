$C^\infty$ quasi-periodic solutions to the incompressible Euler equations with
periodic boundary conditions in dimension 3 and in any even dimension. These
solutions are genuinely high-dimensional, which is particularly interesting
because there are extremely few examples of high-dimensional initial data for
which global solutions are known to exist. These quasi-periodic solutions can
be engineered so that they are dense on tori of arbitrary dimension embedded in
the space of solenoidal vector fields. Furthermore, in the two-dimensional case
we show that quasi-periodic solutions are dense in the phase space of the Euler
equations. More precisely, for any integer $N\geq 1$ we prove that any $L^q$
initial stream function can be approximated in $L^q$ (strongly when $1\leq q<
\infty$ and weak-* when $q=\infty$) by smooth initial data whose solutions are
dense on $N$-dimensional tori.

work, we use integer arithmetic for both forward and back propagation in the
fine-tuning of BERT. We study the effects of varying the integer bit-width on
the model's metric performance. Our integer fine-tuning uses integer arithmetic
to perform forward propagation and gradient computation of linear, layer-norm,
and embedding layers of BERT. We fine-tune BERT using our integer training
method on SQuAD v1.1 and SQuAD v2., and GLUE benchmark. We demonstrate that
metric performance of fine-tuning 16-bit integer BERT matches both 16-bit and
32-bit floating-point baselines. Furthermore, using the faster and more memory
efficient 8-bit integer data type, integer fine-tuning of BERT loses an average

the mock-Chebyshev subset interpolation, where the considered function $f$ is
interpolated only on a proper subset of the uniform grid, formed by nodes that
mimic the behavior of Chebyshev--Lobatto nodes. In the mock-Chebyshev subset

contrasts. Despite all efforts, a consistent AM transport theory, which
reproduces both the internal rotation and mixing probed thanks to the
seismology of stars, remains one of the major open problems in modern stellar
astrophysics. A possible key ingredient to figure out this puzzle is magnetic
field with its various possible topologies. Among them, strong axisymmetric
toroidal fields, which are subject to the so-called Tayler MHD instability,
could play a major role. They could trigger a dynamo action in radiative layers
while the resulting magnetic torque allows an efficient transport of AM. But is
it possible to detect signatures of these deep toroidal magnetic fields? The
only way to answer this question is asteroseismology and the best laboratories
of study are intermediate-mass and massive stars because of their external
radiative envelope. Since most of these are rapid rotators during their
main-sequence, we have to study stellar pulsations propagating in stably
stratified, rotating, and potentially strongly magnetised radiative zones. For
that, we generalise the traditional approximation of rotation, which provides
in its classic version a flexible treatment of the adiabatic propagation of
gravito-inertial modes, by taking simultaneously general axisymmetric
differential rotation and toroidal magnetic fields into account. Using this new
non-perturbative formalism, we derive the asymptotic properties of
magneto-gravito-inertial modes and we explore the different possible field
configurations. We found that the magnetic effects should be detectable for
equatorial fields using high-precision asteroseismic data.

as OCT images suffer from multiplicative speckle noise, resulting in poor
visibility of retinal layers. The traditional denoising methods consider
specific statistical properties of the noise, which are not always known.
Furthermore, recent deep learning-based denoising methods require paired noisy
and clean images, which are often difficult to obtain, especially medical
images. Noise2Noise family architectures are generally proposed to overcome
this issue by learning without noisy-clean image pairs. However, for that,
multiple noisy observations from a single image are typically needed. Also,
sometimes the experiments are demonstrated by simulating noises on clean
synthetic images, which is not a realistic scenario. This work shows how a
single real-world noisy observation of each image can be used to train a
denoising network. Along with a theoretical understanding, our algorithm is
experimentally validated using a publicly available OCT image dataset. Our
approach incorporates Anscombe transform to convert the multiplicative noise
model to additive Gaussian noise to make it suitable for OCT images. The
quantitative results show that this method can outperform several other methods
where a single noisy observation of an image is needed for denoising. The code

it is vital to optimize the deployed locations of BSs and IRSs in the wireless

whether to deploy a BS/IRS in each cell given a total number of BSs/IRSs

purely gaseous disc models. At the same time, computational difficulties arise
with the standard models of simulating the dust and gas separately. These
include the cost of accurately simulating the interactions between well coupled
dust and gas and issues of dust concentration in areas below resolution of the
gas phase. We test a single fluid approach, that incorporates the terminal
velocity approximation valid for small particles, which can overcome these
difficulties, through modification of FARGO3D. We compare this single fluid
model with a multifluid model for a variety of planet masses. We find
differences in the dust density distribution in all cases. For high-mass,
gap-opening planets we find differences in the amplitude of the resulting dust
rings, which we attribute to the failure of the terminal velocity approximation
around shocks. For low-mass planets, both models agree everywhere except in the
corotation region, where the terminal velocity approximation shows overdense
dust lobes. We tentatively interpret these as dusty equivalents of thermal
lobes seen in non-isothermal simulations with thermal diffusion, but more work
is necessary to confirm this. At the same resolution, the computational time
for the terminal velocity approximation model is significantly less than a two
fluid model. We conclude that the terminal velocity approximation is a valuable
tool for modelling a protoplanetary disc but that care should be taken when
shocks are involved.

meaningful notion of infinite sums of operations without supposing any
underlying topology. Opposite to the usual definition of operadic calculus,
they are defined as algebras over cooperads. The goal of this article is to
develop this new theory. First, we relate the homotopy theory of absolute
algebras to the homotopy theory of usual algebras via a duality square. It
intertwines Bar-Cobar adjunctions with linear duality adjunctions. In
particular, we show that linear duality functors between types of coalgebras
and types of algebras are Quillen functors and that they induce equivalences
between objects with degree-wise finite dimensional homology. We embed the
theory of contramodules as a particular case of the theory of absolute
algebras. We study in detail the case of absolute associative algebras and
absolute Lie algebras. Campos--Petersen--Robert-Nicoud--Wierstra showed that
two nilpotent Lie algebras whose universal enveloping algebras are isomorphic
as associative algebras must be isomorphic. We generalize their theorem to any
absolute Lie algebras and any minimal absolute $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-algebra, of
which nilpotent Lie algebras and minimal nilpotent
$\mathcal{L}_\infty$-algebras are a particular cases.

mechanics, hardware, and software along with this paper. Second, we use our
setup to attack a deeply embedded security co-processor in modern AMD systems

published code execution exploit, we run two custom payloads on the AMD-SP that
utilize the SoC to different degrees. We then visualize these fault locations
on SoC photographs allowing us to reason about the SoC's components under
attack. Finally, we show that the signature verification process of one of the
first executed firmware parts is susceptible to EMFI attacks, undermining the
security architecture of the entire SoC. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first reported EMFI attack against an AMD desktop CPU.

the arguments must be defeated, which raises the question of \emph{which

  In legal argumentation, meta-rules determine the valid arguments by

field, in which the capabilities of the segmentation model are incrementally
improved by learning new classes or new domains. A central challenge in
Continual Learning is overcoming the effects of catastrophic forgetting, which
refers to the sudden drop in accuracy on previously learned tasks after the
model is trained on new classes or domains. In continual classification this
challenge is often overcome by replaying a small selection of samples from
previous tasks, however replay is rarely considered in CSS. Therefore, we
investigate the influences of various replay strategies for semantic
segmentation and evaluate them in class- and domain-incremental settings. Our
findings suggest that in a class-incremental setting, it is critical to achieve
a uniform distribution for the different classes in the buffer to avoid a bias
towards newly learned classes. In the domain-incremental setting, it is most
effective to select buffer samples by uniformly sampling from the distribution
of learned feature representations or by choosing samples with median entropy.
Finally, we observe that the effective sampling methods help to decrease the
representation shift significantly in early layers, which is a major cause of
forgetting in domain-incremental learning.

Isolating individual molecules with stable optical emission is an essential

(VOPc) molecules stand out as promising candidates due to their large coherence
times measured in ensemble. However, the optical properties of individual

that the optical response of the molecule under laser illumination of different

Furthermore, the molecule reveals a non-radiative transition rate that depends
on the excitation wavelength when its lifetime is interrogated. We provide

the image data that correlate with the output predictions. Both high and low
frequencies can be characteristic of the underlying noise distribution caused
by the image acquisition rather than in relation to the task-relevant
information about the image content. Models that learn features related to this

Dropout, to prevent convolutional neural networks from learning
frequency-specific imaging features. We employ randomized filtering of feature
maps during training which acts as a feature-level regularization. In this
study, we consider common image processing filters such as Gaussian smoothing,
Laplacian of Gaussian, and Gabor filtering. Our training strategy is
model-agnostic and can be used for any computer vision task. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of Frequency Dropout on a range of popular architectures and

printed circuit boards (PCB). Detection of solder errors during SJI is quite
challenging as the solder joints have very small sizes and can take various
shapes. In this study, we first show that solders have low feature diversity,
and that the SJI can be carried out as a fine-grained image classification task
which focuses on hard-to-distinguish object classes. To improve the
fine-grained classification accuracy, penalizing confident model predictions by
maximizing entropy was found useful in the literature. Inline with this
information, we propose using the {\alpha}-skew Jensen-Shannon divergence
({\alpha}-JS) for penalizing the confidence in model predictions. We compare
the {\alpha}-JS regularization with both existing entropyregularization based
methods and the methods based on attention mechanism, segmentation techniques,
transformer models, and specific loss functions for fine-grained image
classification tasks. We show that the proposed approach achieves the highest
F1-score and competitive accuracy for different models in the finegrained
solder joint classification task. Finally, we visualize the activation maps and
show that with entropy-regularization, more precise class-discriminative
regions are localized, which are also more resilient to noise. Code will be

Starting with the empty graph on $[n]$, at each round a set of $K=K(n)$ edges
is presented, chosen uniformly at random from the missing ones (or from the

of them and add it to the current graph. We show that in this process one can
build a Hamiltonian graph with at most $(1+\epsilon)n$ edges in
$(1+\epsilon)(1+(\log n)/2K) n$ rounds w.h.p. The case $K=1$ implies that
w.h.p. one can build a Hamiltonian graph by choosing $(1+\epsilon)n$ edges in
an on-line fashion as they appear along the first $(0.5+\epsilon)n\log n$ steps

threshold of the corresponding Achlioptas process is at most
$(1+\epsilon)(1+(\log n)/2K) n$. This matches the $(1-\epsilon)(1+(\log n)/2K)

problem of determining the Hamiltonicity threshold of the Achlioptas process

space of curves in a Euclidean space. The approach taken in the elastic shape
analysis framework is to define such a metric by starting with a
reparameterization-invariant Riemannian metric on the space of parameterized
shapes and inducing a metric on the quotient by the group of diffeomorphisms.
This quotient metric is computed, in practice, by finding a registration of two
shapes over the diffeomorphism group. For spaces of Euclidean curves, the
initial Riemannian metric is frequently chosen from a two-parameter family of
Sobolev metrics, called elastic metrics. Elastic metrics are especially
convenient because, for several parameter choices, they are known to be locally
isometric to Riemannian metrics for which one is able to solve the geodesic
boundary problem explictly -- well-known examples of these local isometries
include the complex square root transform of Younes, Michor, Mumford and Shah

fully generalizing the work of many authors over the past two decades. We give

parametric estimation in many scientific and technical fields. The DPLMS
method, introduced some twenty years ago, is effective among the synthesis
algorithms since it derives the optimum filters directly from the experimental
signal and noise waveforms. Two new extensions of the DPLMS method are here
presented. The first one speeds up the synthesis phase and improves the energy
estimation by synthesizing optimum filters with automatically designed flat-top
length. The second one improves the quality of parameter estimation in
multi-channel systems by taking advantage of the inter-channel noise
correlation properties. The theoretical and functional aspects behind the DPLMS
method for optimum filter synthesis are first recalled and illustrated in more
detail. The two new DPLMS extensions are subsequently introduced from the
theoretical viewpoint and more thoroughly considered from the applicative
perspective. The DPLMS optimum filters have been applied first to simulated
signals with various amounts and characteristics of superimposed noise and then
to the experimental waveforms acquired from a solid-state Ge detector. The
results obtained are considered from both the absolute viewpoint and in
comparison with those of more traditional, suboptimal filters. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the two new DPLMS extensions. For
single-channel energy estimations, the optimum filters provide comparatively
better results than the other filters. The DPLMS multi-channel optimum filters
further enhance the quality of the estimations, compared to single-channel
optimum filters, with non-negligible inter-channel noise correlation. The
effectiveness and robustness of the DPLMS method in synthesizing high-quality
filters for energy estimation will be tested soon within leading-edge

may be measures of entanglement between quark degrees of freedom that are
present in QCD, but absent in the intuitive picture with a clear valence-sea
(VS) separation. In this paper, we define the first rigorous measure of VS
entanglement in QCD in an attempt to bring conceptual clarity to this issue,
and, potentially, to find a measure of the applicability of the parton model to
QCD bound states. This VS entanglement vanishes in the large-$N_c$ limit, and
it remains low when finite-$N_c$ states resemble their large-$N_c$
counterparts. We perform a numerical study of VS entanglement in 1+1
dimensional discrete light-cone quantized QCD, and in the process develop a
method for building the color-singlet basis of 1+1d QCD that is manifestly
complete and orthogonal by construction. We calculate this VS entanglement
entropy for the first time and find that it is relatively low for the first few
excited states of both mesons and baryons compared to all other states in the
spectrum, with the VS entropy of ground state hadrons providing a minimum. We
also see that for ground state mesons the entropy is well described in the
$1/N_c$ approximation. These results suggest that low energy hadrons may be the
only QCD bound states for which the large-$N_c$ expansion, and perhaps the
parton model, provide an accurate description. This work also provides the
first evidence that the VS entanglement entropy of QCD in 3+1d, which would
likely serve as an order parameter for the transition between quark and hadron
degrees of freedom, may be perturbatively accessible through a large-$N_c$
expansion.

size ratios ranging from unity to well over 2 is studied. The classic excluded
volume model for spherocylinders and cylinders proposed by Onsager [1] is
revisited to derive an asymptotically correct expression for these binary
packings. From a Taylor series expansion, it follows that the packing fraction
increase by binary polydispersity equals 2f(1 - f)X1(1 - X1)(u - 1)^2 + O((u -
1)^3), where f is the monosized packing fraction, X1 is the number fraction of
a component, and u is the size ratio of the two particles. This equation is in
excellent agreement with the semi-empirical expression provided by Mangelsdorf
and Washington [2] for random close packing (RCP) of spheres. Combining both
approaches, a generic explicit equation for the bidisperse packing fraction is
proposed, which is applicable to size ratios well above 2. This expression is
extensively compared with computer simulations of the random close packing of
binary spherocylinder packings, spheres included, and random loose sphere
packings (1 < u < 2). The derived generic closed-form equation appears to be in
excellent agreement with the collection of computer-generated packing data
using four different computer algorithms and RCP and random loose packing (RLP)
compaction states. Furthermore, the present analysis yields a monodisperse
packing fraction map of a wide collection of particle shapes at different
compaction states. The explicit boundaries of this map appear to be in good
agreement with a broad collection of random close and random loose packing
data. The Appendix presents an overview of published monodisperse packing

this paper, we develop NLMap, an open-vocabulary and queryable scene
representation to address this problem. NLMap serves as a framework to gather
and integrate contextual information into LLM planners, allowing them to see
and query available objects in the scene before generating a
context-conditioned plan. NLMap first establishes a natural language queryable
scene representation with Visual Language models (VLMs). An LLM based object
proposal module parses instructions and proposes involved objects to query the
scene representation for object availability and location. An LLM planner then
plans with such information about the scene. NLMap allows robots to operate
without a fixed list of objects nor executable options, enabling real robot
operation unachievable by previous methods. Project website:

continuous time capacity expansion problem with irreversible investment on the
finite time interval $[0, T]$ and a state dependent scrap value associated with
the production facility at the finite horizon $T$. The capacity process is a
time-inhomogeneous diffusion in which a monotone nondecreasing, possibly
singular, process representing the cumulative investment enters additively. The
levels of capacity, employment and operating capital contribute to the firm's
production and are optimally chosen in order to maximize the expected total
discounted profits. Two different approaches are employed to study and
characterize the boundary. From one side, some first order condition are solved
by using the Bank and El Karoui Representation Theorem, and that sheds further
light on the connection between the threshold which the optimal policy of the
singular stochastic control problem activates at and the optional solution of
Representation Theorem. Its application in the presence of the scrap value is
new. It is accomplished by a suitable devise to overcome the difficulties due
to the presence of a non integral term in the maximizing functional. The
optimal investment process is shown to become active at the so-called ""base
capacity"" level, given as the unique solution of an integral equation. On the
other hand, when the coefficients of the uncontrolled capacity process are
deterministic, the optimal stopping problem classically associated to the
original capacity problem is resumed and some essential properties of the
investment exercise boundary are obtained. The optimal investment process is
proved to be continuous. Unifying approaches and views, the exercise boundary
is shown to coincide with the base capacity, hence it is characterized by an
integral equation not requiring any a priori regularity.

Different from such settings, we tackle a more practical problem of generating
adversarial perturbations using multi-object (i.e., multiple dominant objects)
images as they are representative of most real-world scenes. Our goal is to
design an attack strategy that can learn from such natural scenes by leveraging
the local patch differences that occur inherently in such images (e.g.
difference between the local patch on the object `person' and the object `bike'
in a traffic scene). Our key idea is to misclassify an adversarial multi-object
image by confusing the victim classifier for each local patch in the image.
Based on this, we propose a novel generative attack (called Local Patch
Difference or LPD-Attack) where a novel contrastive loss function uses the
aforesaid local differences in feature space of multi-object scenes to optimize
the perturbation generator. Through various experiments across diverse victim
convolutional neural networks, we show that our approach outperforms baseline
generative attacks with highly transferable perturbations when evaluated under
different white-box and black-box settings.

messages. Many subsequent papers have attempted to model this phenomenon, with
most concentrating on the ""short chain"" of acquaintances rather than their
ability to efficiently route messages. In this paper, we study the small-world
navigability of the U.S. road network, with the goal of providing a model that
explains how messages in the original small-world experiments could be routed
along short paths using U.S. roads. To this end, we introduce the Neighborhood
Preferential Attachment model, which combines elements from Kleinberg's model
and the Barab\'asi-Albert model, such that long-range links are chosen
according to both the degrees and (road-network) distances of vertices in the
network. We empirically evaluate all three models by running a decentralized
routing algorithm, where each vertex only has knowledge of its own neighbors,
and find that our model outperforms both of these models in terms of the
average hop length. Moreover, our experiments indicate that similar to the
Barab\'asi-Albert model, networks generated by our model are scale-free, which
could be a more realistic representation of acquaintanceship links in the

correlation gap measures the ratio between two natural extensions. This
quantity has been identified as the performance guarantee in a range of
approximation algorithms and mechanism design settings. It is known that the
correlation gap of a monotone submodular function is $1-1/e$, and this is tight
even for simple matroid rank functions.
  We initiate a fine-grained study of correlation gaps of matroid rank
functions. In particular, we present improved lower bounds on the correlation
gap as parametrized by the rank and the girth of the matroid. We also show that
the worst correlation gap of a weighted matroid rank function is achieved under
uniform weights. Such improved lower bounds have direct applications for
submodular maximization under matroid constraints, mechanism design, and
contention resolution schemes. Previous work relied on implicit correlation gap
bounds for problems such as list decoding and approval voting.

(GANs) via distinguishing real and synthesized samples. While the real data
distribution remains the same, the synthesis distribution keeps varying because
of the evolving generator, and thus effects a corresponding change to the
bi-classification task for the discriminator. We argue that a discriminator
with an on-the-fly adjustment on its capacity can better accommodate such a
time-varying task. A comprehensive empirical study confirms that the proposed
training strategy, termed as DynamicD, improves the synthesis performance
without incurring any additional computation cost or training objectives. Two
capacity adjusting schemes are developed for training GANs under different data
regimes: i) given a sufficient amount of training data, the discriminator
benefits from a progressively increased learning capacity, and ii) when the
training data is limited, gradually decreasing the layer width mitigates the
over-fitting issue of the discriminator. Experiments on both 2D and 3D-aware
image synthesis tasks conducted on a range of datasets substantiate the
generalizability of our DynamicD as well as its substantial improvement over
the baselines. Furthermore, DynamicD is synergistic to other
discriminator-improving approaches (including data augmentation, regularizers,
and pre-training), and brings continuous performance gain when combined for
learning GANs.

one of the most popular ways to create photorealistic lighting and 360-degree
reflections of 3D scenes in graphics. Given the difficulty of capturing HDRIs,
a versatile and controllable generative model is highly desired, where layman
users can intuitively control the generation process. However, existing
state-of-the-art methods still struggle to synthesize high-quality panoramas
for complex scenes. In this work, we propose a zero-shot text-driven framework,
Text2Light, to generate 4K+ resolution HDRIs without paired training data.
Given a free-form text as the description of the scene, we synthesize the
corresponding HDRI with two dedicated steps: 1) text-driven panorama generation
in low dynamic range(LDR) and low resolution, and 2) super-resolution inverse
tone mapping to scale up the LDR panorama both in resolution and dynamic range.
Specifically, to achieve zero-shot text-driven panorama generation, we first
build dual codebooks as the discrete representation for diverse environmental
textures. Then, driven by the pre-trained CLIP model, a text-conditioned global
sampler learns to sample holistic semantics from the global codebook according
to the input text. Furthermore, a structure-aware local sampler learns to
synthesize LDR panoramas patch-by-patch, guided by holistic semantics. To
achieve super-resolution inverse tone mapping, we derive a continuous
representation of 360-degree imaging from the LDR panorama as a set of
structured latent codes anchored to the sphere. This continuous representation
enables a versatile module to upscale the resolution and dynamic range
simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior capability of
Text2Light in generating high-quality HDR panoramas. In addition, we show the
feasibility of our work in realistic rendering and immersive VR.

the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry could remain unbroken during inflation, even
when the axion decay constant, $f_a$, is (much) above the inflationary Hubble
scale, $H_I$. This is achieved through the heavy-lifting of the PQ scalar field
due to its leading non-renormalizable interaction with the inflaton, encoded in
a high-dimensional operator which respects the approximate shift symmetry of
the inflaton. The mechanism opens up a new window for the post-inflationary QCD
axion and significantly enlarges the parameter space, in which the QCD axion
dark matter with $f_a > H_I$ could be compatible with high-scale inflation and
free from constraints on axion isocurvature perturbations. There also exist
non-derivative couplings, which still keep the inflaton shift symmetry breaking
under control, to achieve the heavy-lifting of the PQ field during inflation.
Additionally, by introducing an early matter domination era, more parameter
space of high $f_a$ could yield the observed DM abundance.

$2-10$ keV intrinsic X-ray luminosity with the inferred X-ray luminosities
based on empirical scaling relations for unobscured AGNs using $L_{\rm
[OIV](25.89\mu {\rm m})}$, $L_{[{\rm OIII}](5007 {\rm angstrom})}$, and
$L_{6\rm \mu m}$ and found that the high-excitation $[{\rm OIV}]$ line provides
a better estimate of the intrinsic $2-10$ keV X-ray luminosity ($L_{2-10}^{\rm
int} \sim 10^{41.41}{\rm erg s}^{-1}$). Our results suggest that
J$144013+024744$ is the first type-2 dwarf galaxy that shows X-ray
spectroscopic evidence for obscuration. The column density that we estimated is
among the highest measured to date for IMBH-powered AGNs, implying that a
typical AGN torus geometry might extend to the low-mass end. This work has
implications for constraining the black hole occupation fraction in dwarf
galaxies using X-ray observations.

star clusters in galaxies that are part of the Hubble treasury program Legacy
ExtraGalactic Uv Survey (LEGUS). In this first paper of a series, we describe
the CLUES sample consisting of 20 young star clusters and report their physical
properties as derived by both multi-wavelength photometry and far-UV (FUV)
spectroscopy with Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Thanks to the synergy of the
two different datasets we build a coherent picture of the diverse stellar
populations found in each region (with sizes of 40 to 160 pc). We associate the
FUV-brightest stellar population to the central targeted star cluster and the
other modeled population to the diffuse stars that are included in the COS
aperture. We observe better agreement between photometric and spectroscopic
ages for star clusters younger than 5 Myr. For clusters older than 5 Myr,
photometry and spectroscopy measurements deviate, with the latter producing
older ages, due to the degeneracy of photometric models. FUV spectroscopy
enables us to better constrain the stellar metallicities, a parameter that
optical colors are insensitive to. Finally, the derived E(B-V) are quite
similar, with a tendency for FUV spectroscopy to favor solutions with higher
extinctions. The recovered masses are in agreement within a factor of 2 for all
the clusters.

might therefore shed light on the physics and origins of SNe. Here we analyse
the \textit{Gaia} DR3 data to search for HVS WDs candidates, and peculiar
sub-main-sequence (sub-MS) objects. We retrieve the previously identified HVSs,
and find 46 new HVS candidates. Among these we identify two new unbound WDs and
two new unbound sub-MS candidates. The remaining stars are hyper-runaway WDs

sub-MS candidates suggest that extreme velocity ejections ($>1000$
km\,s$^{-1}$) can accompany at most a small fraction of type Ia SNe,
disfavouring a significant contribution of the D6-scenario to the origin of Ia
SNe. The rate of HVS ejections following the hybrid WD reverse-detonation
channel could be consistent with the identified HVSs. The numbers of
lower-velocity HVS WDs could be consistent with type Iax SNe origin and/or

$\Lambda$CDM paradigm since they are not found in simulations directly.
However, the methods to measure substructure masses strongly differ between
observations and simulations. Using the fully hydrodynamical cosmological
simulation suite Magneticum Pathfinder we develop a method to measure
substructure masses in projection from simulations, similar to the
observational approach. We identify a simulated Abell 2744 counterpart that not
only has eight substructures of similar mass fractions but also exhibits
similar features in the hot gas component. This cluster formed only recently
through a major merger together with at least 6 massive minor merger events

high fractions indicating merger events within the last 2Gyr. Finally, we
demonstrate that the differences between subhalo masses measured directly from

with the latter generally 2-3 times larger than the former. We provide a
predictor function to estimate projected substructure masses from SubFind

constrained the properties of dark matter by measuring the parameters of one or

require various compromises to the realism of lensing models for the sake of
computational tractability, such as ignoring the numerous other subhalos and
line-of-sight halos in the system, assuming a particular form for the source
model and requiring the noise to have a known likelihood function. Here we show
that a simulation-based inference method called truncated marginal neural ratio
estimation (TMNRE) makes it possible to relax these requirements by training
neural networks to directly compute marginal posteriors for subhalo parameters
from lensing images. By performing a set of inference tasks on mock data, we
verify the accuracy of TMNRE and show it can compute posteriors for subhalo

architectures explored in other lensing analyses. Furthermore, we show that
since TMNRE learns a posterior function it enables direct statistical checks

show that TMNRE is well-suited for analyzing complex lensing data, and that the

extensively studied. If a corresponding narrow line from the X-ray irradiated

field theories. It was shown that they can be extended as well-defined

FLRW models, showing that this `tameness' of cosmological singularities is not
an artifact of the technical simplifications due to spatial flatness. Our

$\langle \hat T_{ab}(x)\rangle_{ren}$ at the big-bang. While the technical
expressions are more complicated than in the spatially flat case, there is also
an unexpected conceptual simplification: the infrared divergence \cite{fp} is
now absent because, in effect, the spatial curvature provides a natural cutoff.

briefly dominating the linear polarization measured by ALMA in the unresolved

interstellar absorption lines in spectra of nearby stars show absorption
components from more than a dozen warm partially ionized clouds within 15 pc of

Galactic (G) cloud - move toward each other. Their bulk heliocentric velocities
can be compared with the interstellar neutral helium flow velocity obtained
from space-based experiments. We combine recent results from Ulysses, IBEX, and
STEREO observations to find a more accurate estimate of the velocity and
temperature of the very local interstellar medium. We find that, contrary to
the widespread viewpoint that the Sun resides inside the LIC, the locally
observed velocity of the interstellar neutral helium is consistent with a
linear combination of the velocities of the LIC and G cloud, but not with
either of these two velocities. This finding shows that the Sun travels through
a mixed-cloud interstellar medium composed of material from both these clouds.
Interactions between these clouds explain the substantially higher density of
the interstellar hydrogen near the Sun and toward stars located within the
interaction region of these two clouds. The observed asymmetry of the
interstellar helium distribution function also supports this interaction. The
structure and equilibrium in this region require further studies using in situ
and telescopic observations.

exhibit an offset prevalence of only $\sim2\%$. These highly variable objects
have redder optical color and steeper optical spectral indices indicative of
blazars, in which the optical and radio emission is dominated by a
line-of-sight jet, and indeed nearly $\sim100\%$ of the most variable objects
have $\gamma$-ray emission detected by Fermi LAT. This result is consistent
with selection on variability preferentially picking jets pointed closest to

minimized and jet emission is maximally boosted in the observed frame. While

118 blazars detected in the BAT 105-month survey catalog, with newly obtained
redshifts from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS). We determine the
best-fit X-ray luminosity function for the whole blazar population, as well as
for Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) alone. The main results are: (1) at any
redshift, BAT detects the most luminous blazars, above any possible break in
their luminosity distribution, which means we cannot differentiate between
density and luminosity evolution; (2) the whole blazar population, dominated by
FSRQs, evolves positively up to redshift z~4.3, confirming earlier results and
implying lower number densities of blazars at higher redshifts than previously
estimated. The contribution of this source class to the Cosmic X-ray Background
at 14-195 keV can range from 5-18%, while possibly accounting for 100% of the
MeV background. We also derived the average 14 keV-10 GeV SED for BAT blazars,
which allows us to predict the number counts of sources in the MeV range, as
well as the expected number of high-energy (>100 TeV) neutrinos. A mission like
COSI, will detect 40 MeV blazars and 2 coincident neutrinos. Finally, taking
into account beaming selection effects, the distribution and properties of the
parent population of these extragalactic jets are derived. We find that the
distribution of viewing angles is quite narrow, with most sources aligned
within < 5{\deg} of the line of sight. Moreover, the average Lorentz factor,
<$\Gamma$>= 8-12, is lower than previously suggested for these powerful
sources.

temperature anisotropies, so-called ""bright spot"" or ""hot spots"". Such orbiting
features may explain observations at infrared wavelengths as well as recent
findings at millimeter wavelengths. In this work, we study the emission from an
orbiting equatorial bright spot, imposed on a radiatively inefficient accretion
flow background, to find polarimetric features indicative of the underlying
magnetic field structure and other system variables including inclination
angle, spot size, black hole spin, and more. Specifically, we investigate the
impact of these parameters on the Stokes Q-U signatures that commonly exhibit a
typical double loop (pretzel-like) structure. Our semi-analytical model,
describing the underlying plasma conditions and the orbiting spot, is built
within the framework of the numerical radiative transfer code ipole, which
calculates synchroton emission at 230 GHz. We showcase the wide variety of Q-U
loop signatures and the relation between inner and outer loops. For the
vertical magnetic field topology, the inner Q-U loop is explained by the
suppression of the synchrotron emission as seen by the distant observer. For
the radial and toroidal magnetic field topologies, the inner \quloop
corresponds to the part of the orbit where the spot it is receding with respect
to the observer. Based on our models we conclude that it is possible to
constrain the underlying magnetic field topology with an analysis of the Q-U
loop geometry, particularly in combination with a circular polarization

Existing research on software maintenance has studied the issue-reporting needs

reporting ML issues requires domain-specific information. Because of the
different characteristics between ML and traditional Software Engineering
systems, we do not know to what extent the reporting needs are different, and
to what extent these differences impact the issue resolution process.
Objective: Our objective is to investigate whether there is a discrepancy in
the distribution of resolution time between ML and non-ML issues and whether
certain categories of ML issues require a longer time to resolve based on real
issue reports in open-source applied ML projects. We further investigate the
size of fix of ML issues and non-ML issues. Method: We extract issues reports,

subjective experience from human-robot interaction through the proposed gesture

intuitive (2.0), not causing frustration (2.63), and requiring low physical

push non-informative latent dimensions towards zero to induce sparsity.

  welcome",,"10.1093/mnras/stac2694",,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Radio relics are Mpc-sized synchrotron sources located in the peripheral
regions of galaxy clusters. Models based on the diffuse shock acceleration
(DSA) scenario have been widely accepted to explain the formation of radio
relics. However, a critical challenge to these models is that most observed
shocks seem too weak to generate detectable emission, unless fossil electrons,
a population of mildly energetic electrons that have been accelerated
previously, are included in the models. To address this issue, we present a new
semi-analytical model to describe the formation and evolution of radio relics
by incorporating fossil relativistic electrons into DSA theory, which is
constrained by a sample of 14 observed relics, and employ the Press-Schechter
formalism to simulate the relics in a $20^{\circ} \times 20^{\circ}$ sky field
at 50, 158, and 1400 MHz, respectively. Results show that fossil electrons
contribute significantly to the radio emission, which can generate radiation
four orders of magnitude brighter than that solely produced by thermal
electrons at 158 MHz, and the power distribution of our simulated radio relic
catalog can reconcile the observed $P_{1400}-M_{\mathrm{vir}}$ relation. We
predict that $7.1\%$ clusters with $M_{\mathrm{vir}} > 1.2\times
10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ would host relics at 158 MHz, which is consistent
with the result of $10 \pm 6\%$ given by the LoTSS DR2. It is also found that
radio relics are expected to cause severe foreground contamination in future
EoR experiments, similar to that of radio halos. The possibility of AGN
providing seed fossil relativistic electrons is evaluated by calculating the
number of radio-loud AGNs that a shock is expected to encounter during its
propagation.

theoretical neuroscience is a heterogeneous field that has not yet agreed on
how to build theories or whether it is desirable to have an overarching theory

for the need of developing theoretical frameworks as a basis of generating
common theoretical structures. We enumerate the elements of theoretical
frameworks we deem necessary for any theory in neuroscience. In particular, we
address the notions of paradigms, models, and scales of organizations. We then
identify areas with pressing needs to develop brain theories: integration of
statistical and dynamic approaches; multi-scale integration; coding; and
interpretability in the context of Artificial Intelligence. We also point out
that future theoretical frameworks would benefit from the incorporation of the
principles of Evolution as a fundamental structure rather than purely

collection of expert-labeled light curves to achieve adequate performance,
which is costly to construct. To solve this problem, we introduce two
approaches. First, a semi-supervised hierarchical method, which requires
substantially less trained data than supervised methods. Second, a clustering

dimensionality reduction of the data for visualization and to avoid the curse

around 90\% for all of our three selected catalogs of variable stars using only
$5\%$ of the data in the training. This method is suitable for classifying the
main classes of variable stars when there is only a small amount of training

purity over 90\% with respect to classes and 80\% with respect to sub-classes,
suggesting that this type of analysis can be used in large-scale variability

results of physical experiments. In some cases, due to the limited amount of
experimental data, ML-models can be pre-trained on synthetic data simulated
based on the analytical theory and then fine-tuned using experimental data. A
limitation of this approach is the presence of the latent parameters of the
analytical model, which values are difficult or impossible to estimate. Setting
these parameters incorrectly may induce a dataset shift even when applied to
synthetic data. To overcome this problem, we train the ML-model on a dataset
with randomly varied latent parameters of the analythical model to force the
ML-model to concentrate on more general patterns that depend weakly on the
latent parameters. We applied this approach to the problem of tight focusing of
a laser pulse with the complex structure of the wavefront. We observed good
accuracy of reconstructing of the tilt parameters when training and testing the
ML-model on datasets generated for different values of the latent parameters.
This confirms that the ML-model was able to select relevant information without
over-fitting for specific features inherent in certain values of the latent
parameters. We believe that this approach will enrich possible applications of
ML-methods to an experimental diagnostics of laser pulses.

could lead to a false identification of molecules. Since $\eta$ Carinae is a
bright source, the issue is even more critical because some features can be
highlighted. In this work, we explore three different sets of ALMA archive data

elimination of telluric lines during ALMA calibration procedure. We found that
these absorption lines are not present in the phase calibrators because they
are much weaker than $\eta$ Car, where the absorption line appears because the

encountered in modern engineering, including additive manufacturing, semi-solid
flow cells, dip-coating, adhesive locomotion, where they are subjected to

transition induced by large enough shear, which results in complex transient
phenomena such as non-monotonic stress responses, i.e., stress overshoot, and
spatially heterogeneous flows, e.g., shear-banding or brittle failure. In the
present article, we propose a pedagogical introduction to a continuum model
based on a spatially-resolved fluidity approach that we recently introduced to
rationalize shear-induced yielding in SGMs. Our model, which relies upon
non-local effects, quantitatively captures salient features associated with
such complex flows, including the rate dependence of the stress overshoot, as
well as transient shear-banded flows together with nontrivial scaling laws for
fluidization times. This approach offers a versatile framework to account for
subtle effects, such as avalanche-like phenomena, or the impact of boundary
conditions, which we illustrate by including in our model the
elasto-hydrodynamic slippage of soft particles compressed against solid

  Partially-Observed Trajectories",,,,,"math.DS cs.CE cs.LG cs.SY eess.SP eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Data-driven models for nonlinear dynamical systems based on approximating the
underlying Koopman operator or generator have proven to be successful tools for
forecasting, feature learning, state estimation, and control. It has become
well known that the Koopman generators for control-affine systems also have
affine dependence on the input, leading to convenient finite-dimensional
bilinear approximations of the dynamics. Yet there are still two main obstacles
that limit the scope of current approaches for approximating the Koopman
generators of systems with actuation. First, the performance of existing
methods depends heavily on the choice of basis functions over which the Koopman
generator is to be approximated; and there is currently no universal way to
choose them for systems that are not measure preserving. Secondly, if we do not
observe the full state, we may not gain access to a sufficiently rich
collection of such functions to describe the dynamics. This is because the
commonly used method of forming time-delayed observables fails when there is
actuation. To remedy these issues, we write the dynamics of observables
governed by the Koopman generator as a bilinear hidden Markov model, and
determine the model parameters using the expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm. The E-step involves a standard Kalman filter and smoother, while the
M-step resembles control-affine dynamic mode decomposition for the generator.
We demonstrate the performance of this method on three examples, including
recovery of a finite-dimensional Koopman-invariant subspace for an actuated
system with a slow manifold; estimation of Koopman eigenfunctions for the
unforced Duffing equation; and model-predictive control of a fluidic pinball
system based only on noisy observations of lift and drag.

bipartite lattices, with the geometric frustrations playing a key role both in
their stability and the eventual `melting' due to quantum fluctuations. Here,
we ask the question of the stability of such dimerized solids in spin-1
systems, taking the anisotropic square lattice with bilinear and biquadratic
spin-spin interactions as a paradigmatic model. The lattice can be viewed as a
set of coupled spin-1 chains, which in the limit of vanishing inter-chain
coupling are known to possess a stable dimer phase. We study this model using
the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and infinite projected
entangled-pair states (iPEPS) techniques, supplemented by the analytical
mean-field and linear flavor wave theory calculations. While the latter
predicts the dimer phase to remain stable up to a reasonably large
interchain-to-intrachain coupling ratio $r \lesssim 0.6$, the DMRG and iPEPS
find that the dimer solid melts for much weaker interchain coupling not
exceeding $r\lesssim 0.15$. We find the transition into a magnetically ordered
state to be first order, manifested by a hysteresis and order parameter jump,
precluding the deconfined quantum critical scenario. The apparent lack of
stability of dimerized phases in 2D spin-1 systems is indicative of strong
quantum fluctuations that melt the dimer solid.

bypasses the calculation of high-order derivative operators and mitigates the
contamination of backpropagated gradients. Consequently, we reduce the

temperature and radius of each component star through Doppler tomography and
spectral energy distribution analyses. We found masses of 1.4-3.5 Msun, radii
of 1.5-4.7 Rsun, and temperatures of 6400-10300K. We then compare the observed
stellar parameters to the predictions of the stellar evolution models, but
found that only one of our systems fits well with the evolutionary models.

Charge Carrier Refractive (TCCR) noise. TCCR noise was previously studied in
2020 by Bruns et al., using a Langevin force approach. Here we compute the
power spectral density of TCCR noise by both using the Fluctuation-Dissipation
theorem (FDT) and accounting for previously neglected effects of the standing
wave of laser light which is produced inside the input test mass by its
high-reflecting coatings. We quantify our results with parameters from Einstein
Telescope, and show that at temperatures of 10 K the amplitude of TCCR noise is
up to a factor of $\sqrt{2}$ times greater than what was previously claimed,
and from 77 K to 300 K the amplitude is around 5 to 7 orders of magnitude lower
than previously claimed when we choose to neglect the standing wave, and is up
to a factor of 6 times lower if the standing wave is included. Despite these
differences, we still conclude like Bruns et al. that TCCR noise should not be
a limiting noise source for next-generation gravitational-wave interferometers.

Our B$\chi$PT calculation shows a significantly smaller effect than the

Whether PNet is more robust against adversarial inputs than regular neural

that can successfully attack PNet in both target and untarget manners. The
attack results show that PNet robustness against adversarial inputs needs to be
improved. This is not a trivial task because the PNet model owner does not have
access to the plaintext of the input values, which prevents the application of
existing detection and defense methods such as input tuning, model
normalization, and adversarial training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
new fast and accurate noise insertion method, called RPNet, to design Robust

ability, the finite-temperature quasiparticle random phase approximation
(FT-QRPA) presents itself as an efficient method to study the properties of hot
nuclei. The statistical ensembles in the FT-QRPA make the theory much richer
than its zero-temperature counterpart, but also obscure the meaning of various
physical quantities. In this work, we clarify several aspects of the FT-QRPA,
including notations seen in the literature, and demonstrate how to extract
physical quantities from the theory. To exemplify the correct treatment of
finite-temperature transitions, we place special emphasis on the
charge-exchange transitions described within the proton-neutron FT-QRPA
(FT-PNQRPA). With the FT-PNQRPA built on the nuclear energy-density functional
theory, we obtain solutions using a relativistic matrix approach and also the
non-relativistic finite amplitude method. We show that the Ikeda sum rule is
fulfilled with the proper treatment of de-excitations from thermally populated
excited states. Additionally, we demonstrate the impact of these transitions on
stellar electron capture (EC) rates in ${}^{58,78}$Ni. While their inclusion
does not influence the EC rates in ${}^{58}$Ni, the rates in ${}^{78}$Ni are
dominated by de-excitations for temperatures $T > 0.5$ MeV. In systems with a
large negative $Q$-value, the inclusion of de-excitations within the FT-QRPA is
necessary for a complete description of reaction rates at finite temperature.

Emission from optically thick $^{12}$CO extends across the region, while
$^{13}$CO, [C I] and especially C$^{18}$O are more optically thin, and
concentrate into clumps and filaments closer to the PDR interface. Within the
Western Wall cloud itself we identify 254 distinct core-sized clumps in our

that of the stellar IMF. Aside from a large-scale velocity gradient, the clump
radial velocities lack any spatial coherence size. There is no direct evidence
for triggering of star formation in the Western Wall in that its C$^{18}$O
clumps and continuum cores appear starless, with no pillars present. However,
the densest portion of the cloud lies closest to the PDR, and the C$^{18}$O

the cooling of relativistic electrons through radiation (synchrotron and

and light-curves of the synchrotron Gamma-Ray Burst produced by such cooling
electrons. Here, we derive the low-energy slope b_LE of GRB pulse-integrated
spectrum and quantify the implications of the measured distribution of b_LE.
  If the magnetic field lives longer than it takes the cooling GRB electrons to
radiate below 1-10 keV, then radiative cooling processes of power P(gamma) ~
gamma^n with n geq 2, i.e. synchrotron and inverse-Compton (iC) through Thomson
scatterings, lead to a soft low-energy spectral slope b_LE leq -1/2 of the GRB
pulse-integrated spectrum F_eps ~ eps^{b_LE} below the peak-energy E_p,
irrespective of the duration of electron injection t_i. IC-cooling dominated by
scatterings at the Thomson--Klein-Nishina transition of synchrotron photons
below E_p has an index n = 2/3 -> 1 and yield harder integrated spectra with
b_LE in [0,1/6], while adiabatic electron-cooling leads to a soft slope b_LE =
-3/4.
  Radiative processes that produce soft integrated spectra can accommodate the
harder slopes measured by CGRO/BATSE and Fermi/GBM only if the magnetic field
life-time t_B is shorter than the time during which the typical GRB electrons
cool to radiate below 1-10 keV, which is less than (at most) ten radiative
cooling timescales t_rad of the typical GRB electron. In this case, there is a
one-to-one correspondence between t_B and b_LE. To account for low-energy
slopes b_LE > -3/4, adiabatic electron-cooling requires a similar restriction
on t_B. In this case, the diversity of slopes arises mostly from how the
electron-injection rate varies with time and not from the magnetic field
timescale.

the scheme for binary bosons subject to Rabi coupling and magnetic detuning,
where the liquid-gas transition can be conveniently tuned and their coexistence
can be characterized by a discontinuous density profile in a harmonic trap. The
spin twist scheme for LGTC can be generalized to a wide class of quantum
systems with competing single-particle and interaction orders.

direction, which is prone to the rotors' settling time induced from the rotors'
own dynamics. Furthermore, the omnidirectional multirotor's stability for
tracking control in the presence of rotor dynamics has not yet been addressed.
To resolve this issue, we propose a geometric tracking controller that takes
the rotor dynamics into account. We show that the proposed controller yields
the zero equilibrium of the error dynamics almost globally exponentially
stable. The controller's tracking performance and stability are verified in
simulations. Furthermore, the single-axis force experiment with the

is the realization of two-qubit gates between distant qubits. Recently, strong
coupling between an electron spin and microwave resonator photons as well as a
microwave resonator mediated coupling between two electron spins both in the
resonant and the dispersive regime have been reported and, thus, a microwave
resonator mediated electron spin two qubit gate seems to be in reach. Inspired
by these findings, we theoretically investigate the interaction of a microwave
resonator with a hybrid quantum dot-donor (QDD) system consisting of a gate
defined Si QD and a laterally displaced $^{31}$P phosphorous donor atom
implanted in the Si host material. We find that driving the QDD system allows
to compensate the frequency mismatch between the donor nuclear spin splitting
in the MHz regime and typical superconducting resonator frequencies in the GHz
regime, and also enables an effective nuclear spin-photon coupling. While we
expect this coupling to be weak, we predict that coupling the nuclear spins of
two distant QDD systems dispersively to the microwave resonator allows the
implementation of a resonator mediated nuclear spin two-qubit
$\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate with a gate fidelity approaching $90\%$.

evolve via a combination of growth (by node addition and random attachment) and
contraction (by random node deletion). To this end we consider a network model
in which at each time step a node addition and random attachment step takes
place with probability $P_{add}$ and a random node deletion step takes place
with probability $P_{del}=1-P_{add}$. The balance between the growth and
contraction processes is captured by the parameter $\eta=P_{add}-P_{del}$. The
case of pure network growth is described by $\eta=1$. In case that $0<\eta<1$
the rate of node addition exceeds the rate of node deletion and the overall
process is of network growth. In the opposite case, where $-1<\eta<0$, the
overall process is of network contraction, while in the special case of
$\eta=0$ the expected size of the network remains fixed, apart from
fluctuations. Using the master equation we obtain a closed form expression for
the time dependent degree distribution $P_t(k)$. The degree distribution
$P_t(k)$ includes a term that depends on the initial degree distribution
$P_0(k)$, which decays as time evolves, and an asymptotic distribution
$P_{st}(k)$. In the case of pure network growth ($\eta=1$) the asymptotic
distribution $P_{st}(k)$ follows an exponential distribution, while for
$-1<\eta<1$ it consists of a sum of Poisson-like terms and exhibits a
Poisson-like tail. In the case of overall network growth ($0 < \eta < 1$) the
degree distribution $P_t(k)$ eventually converges to $P_{st}(k)$. In the case
of overall network contraction ($-1 < \eta < 0$) we identify two different
regimes. For $-1/3 < \eta < 0$ the degree distribution $P_t(k)$ quickly
converges towards $P_{st}(k)$. In contrast, for $-1 < \eta < -1/3$ the
convergence of $P_t(k)$ is initially very slow and it gets closer to
$P_{st}(k)$ only shortly before the network vanishes.

functions, and that the probability of observing a particle at some future
location is proportional to the squared modulus of the amplitude of its wave
function. Although this statistical relationship is well quantified, the
interpretations have remained controversial, with many split between the
classical Copenhagen interpretation and some variation of the de Broglie-Bohm
pilot wave models. Recent experiments with Hydrodynamic Quantum Analogs (HQAs)
have demonstrated that droplets of real fluid may achieve stable dynamical
states, where interaction of the droplets with their own ripples results in
motion analogous to the motion of particles subject to the guiding equation
under the pilot wave models. Indeed, many effects previously thought to be
exclusively quantum have now been observed as emergent phenomena in these
macroscopic HQAs. This has motivated us to explore the possibility that quantum
mechanics may actually be the result of fluid dynamics on some real quantum
scale fluid. In this paper, we show that if there is a real quantum scale fluid
having dynamics analogous to the fluid in HQAs, then this fluid must be a
superfluid, and the dynamics of that fluid must take place on the surface of a
4-dimensional hypersphere. Under the influence of cosmological inflation, we
further show that these bouncing droplets would have the illusion of a property
analogous to rest mass, and that the principles of inertia, momentum,
mass-energy equivalence, general relativity, the uncertainty principle and the
appearance of a time-like dimension can all be derived for droplets as purely
emergent phenomena from the fluid dynamics of this system. As such, we believe
that this model merits consideration as a potential foundation for a new
unifying theory of physics at all scales.

in-hand manipulation of a rigid object involving grasp changes using
fully-actuated multifingered robotic hands. While the framework can be applied
to the general dexterous manipulation, we focus on a more complex definition of
in-hand manipulation, where at the goal pose the hand has to reach a grasp
suitable for using the object as a tool. The high level planner determines the
object trajectory as well as the grasp changes, i.e. adding, removing, or
sliding fingers, to be executed by the low-level controller. While the grasp
sequence is planned online by a learning-based policy to adapt to variations,
the trajectory planner and the low-level controller for object tracking and
contact force control are exclusively model-based to robustly realize the plan.
By infusing the knowledge about the physics of the problem and the low-level
controller into the grasp planner, it learns to successfully generate grasps
similar to those generated by model-based optimization approaches, obviating
the high computation cost of online running of such methods to account for
variations. By performing experiments in physics simulation for realistic tool
use scenarios, we show the success of our method on different tool-use tasks
and dexterous hand models. Additionally, we show that this hybrid method offers
more robustness to trajectory and task variations compared to a model-based
method.

professionals. ""Discharge summaries"" are one promising application of the
summarization, because they can be generated from daily inpatient records. Our
preliminary experiment suggests that 20-31% of the descriptions in discharge
summaries overlap with the content of the inpatient records. However, it
remains unclear how the summaries should be generated from the unstructured
source. To decompose the physician's summarization process, this study aimed to
identify the optimal granularity in summarization. We first defined three types
of summarization units with different granularities to compare the performance
of the discharge summary generation: whole sentences, clinical segments, and
clauses. We defined clinical segments in this study, aiming to express the
smallest medically meaningful concepts. To obtain the clinical segments, it was
necessary to automatically split the texts in the first stage of the pipeline.
Accordingly, we compared rule-based methods and a machine learning method, and
the latter outperformed the formers with an F1 score of 0.846 in the splitting
task. Next, we experimentally measured the accuracy of extractive summarization
using the three types of units, based on the ROUGE-1 metric, on a
multi-institutional national archive of health records in Japan. The measured
accuracies of extractive summarization using whole sentences, clinical
segments, and clauses were 31.91, 36.15, and 25.18, respectively. We found that
the clinical segments yielded higher accuracy than sentences and clauses. This
result indicates that summarization of inpatient records demands finer
granularity than sentence-oriented processing. Although we used only Japanese
health records, it can be interpreted as follows: physicians extract ""concepts
of medical significance"" from patient records and recombine them ...

based on labeled datasets. A standard scheme in external clustering validation
is to use class labels as ground truth clusters, based on the assumption that
each class forms a single, clearly separated cluster. However, as such
cluster-label matching (CLM) assumption often breaks, the lack of conducting a
sanity check for the CLM of benchmark datasets casts doubt on the validity of
external validations. Still, evaluating the degree of CLM is challenging. For
example, internal clustering validation measures can be used to quantify CLM
within the same dataset to evaluate its different clusterings but are not
designed to compare clusterings of different datasets. In this work, we propose
a principled way to generate between-dataset internal measures that enable the
comparison of CLM across datasets. We first determine four axioms for
between-dataset internal measures, complementing Ackerman and Ben-David's
within-dataset axioms. We then propose processes to generalize internal
measures to fulfill these new axioms, and use them to extend the widely used
Calinski-Harabasz index for between-dataset CLM evaluation. Through
quantitative experiments, we (1) verify the validity and necessity of the
generalization processes and (2) show that the proposed between-dataset
Calinski-Harabasz index accurately evaluates CLM across datasets. Finally, we
demonstrate the importance of evaluating CLM of benchmark datasets before
conducting external validation.

rarely applied in regression calibration, despite that it requires less

specifically the bootstrap. This is likely due to requiring specialized
statistical coding. In practice, a simple bootstrap approach with Wald
confidence intervals is often applied, but this approach can yield confidence
intervals that do not achieve the nominal coverage level. We first outline the
steps needed to compute the sandwich variance estimator. We then develop a
convenient method of computation in R for sandwich variance estimation, which
leverages standard regression model outputs and existing R functions and can be
applied in the case of a simple random sample or complex survey design. We use
a simulation study to compare the performance of the sandwich to a resampling
variance approach for both data settings. Finally, we further compare these two
variance estimation approaches for data examples from the Women's Health

explainability, and fairness. In recent years, researchers have increasingly
used complex and advanced machine learning methods to improve prediction
accuracy. Even though a machine learning method could potentially improve the
model accuracy, it complicates simple logistic regression, deteriorates
explainability, and often violates fairness. In the absence of compliance with
regulatory requirements, even highly accurate machine learning methods are
unlikely to be accepted by companies for credit scoring. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of monotonic neural additive models, which meet
regulatory requirements by simplifying neural network architecture and
enforcing monotonicity. By utilizing the special architectural features of the
neural additive model, the monotonic neural additive model penalizes
monotonicity violations effectively. Consequently, the computational cost of

degradation when encountering distinct tasks. To tackle this challenge, this
paper proposes a novel personalized Meta-RL (pMeta-RL) algorithm, which
aggregates task-specific personalized policies to update a meta-policy used for
all tasks, while maintaining personalized policies to maximize the average
return of each task under the constraint of the meta-policy. We also provide
the theoretical analysis under the tabular setting, which demonstrates the
convergence of our pMeta-RL algorithm. Moreover, we extend the proposed
pMeta-RL algorithm to a deep network version based on soft actor-critic, making
it suitable for continuous control tasks. Experiment results show that the
proposed algorithms outperform other previous Meta-RL algorithms on Gym and
MuJoCo suites.

skeleton-based action recognition. These methods find the nearest neighbor

more fine-grained recognition usually relies on determining key local body

efficiency of pavement maintenance and reducing the cost of labor and
resources. A recently influential branch of this task divides the pavement
image into patches and addresses these issues from the perspective of
multi-instance learning. However, these methods neglect the correlation between
patches and suffer from a low efficiency in the model optimization and
inference. Meanwhile, Swin Transformer is able to address both of these issues
with its unique strengths. Built upon Swin Transformer, we present a vision
Transformer named \textbf{P}avement \textbf{I}mage \textbf{C}lassification
\textbf{T}ransformer (\textbf{PicT}) for pavement distress classification. In
order to better exploit the discriminative information of pavement images at
the patch level, the \textit{Patch Labeling Teacher} is proposed to leverage a
teacher model to dynamically generate pseudo labels of patches from image
labels during each iteration, and guides the model to learn the discriminative
features of patches. The broad classification head of Swin Transformer may
dilute the discriminative features of distressed patches in the feature
aggregation step due to the small distressed area ratio of the pavement image.
To overcome this drawback, we present a \textit{Patch Refiner} to cluster
patches into different groups and only select the highest distress-risk group
to yield a slim head for the final image classification. We evaluate our method
on CQU-BPDD. Extensive results show that \textbf{PicT} outperforms the
second-best performed model by a large margin of $+2.4\%$ in P@R on detection
task, $+3.9\%$ in $F1$ on recognition task, and 1.8x throughput, while enjoying
7x faster training speed using the same computing resources. Our codes and

a four-fold quasidegenerate ground state separated from excited states by a

demonstrate the existence of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quasiparticles at the edges of
the chain by observing the magnetic field dependence of the low energy spectrum

isolates the singlet and $S^z=0$ triplet states from the other triplet

the regions in parameter space where the low energy spectrum of the

Common intuition from polynomial regression suggests that overparameterized

At present, a precise characterization of the relationship between
interpolation and generalization for deep networks is missing. In this work, we

researchers to interpret results. For highly regulated financial industries,
transparency, explainability, and fairness are equally, if not more, important
than accuracy. Without meeting regulated requirements, even highly accurate

introducing a novel class of transparent and interpretable machine learning

generalized gloves of neural additive models separate features into three
categories: linear features, individual nonlinear features, and interacted
nonlinear features. Additionally, interactions in the last category are only
local. The linear and nonlinear components are distinguished by a stepwise
selection algorithm, and interacted groups are carefully verified by applying
additive separation criteria. Empirical results demonstrate that generalized

considering how to capture more client-specific and class-relevant information

compact form for efficient communication. We perform a thorough evaluation of
the proposed FedPCL in the lightweight framework, measuring and visualizing its

capable of multiband operation. Recent studies on wavelength division
multiplexing (WDM) systems have pointed out the impact of amplified spontaneous
emission (ASE) noise generated by signals of different wavelengths, which
causes OSNR degradation. Therefore, it is desirable to filter out the ASE noise
from different transponders when multiplexing multiple wavelengths at the
transmitter side, especially in a system with non-wavelength selective
combiners such as directional couplers and multicast switches. The use of
transponder aggregators with filtering functions, such as the M x N wavelength

of these devices is that it is difficult to provide economical multiband
support. Therefore, we propose an economical transponder aggregator
configuration by allowing a certain amount of ASE superposition and reducing
the number of filtering functions. In this paper, we fabricated a prototype of

distributed compensation of polarization mode dispersion (PMD) within the

it also couples the compensation of nonlinearity and PMD. Consequently, it is

(EoS), using the 1824 waveforms from Richers et al. (2017) for a 12 solar mass
progenitor. High prediction accuracy for the classifications of the rotation
length scales ($93\%$) and the rotational rates ($95\%$) can be achieved using
the gravitational wave signals from -10 ms to 6 ms core bounce. By including
additional 48 ms signals during the prompt convection phase, we could achieve
$96\%$ accuracy on the classification of four major EoS groups. Combining three

Even though the statistical literature is awash with the research on the

findings: only few statisticians conducted research on the application of the
method to real world problems. Through this paper, we extend the domain of
application of this methodology to various applied fields by providing a
solution to a rather challenging and complicated computational problem. The
problem this paper tackles is an image segmentation which has been used in
various fields. We propose a novel method based on the classical minimum
distance estimation theory to solve the image segmentation problem. The
performance of the proposed method is then further elevated by integrating it
with the ``segmenting-together"" strategy. We demonstrate that the proposed

the segmentation problem when it is applied to the complex, real images such as

signal estimation from noisy nonlinear measurements. We assume that the unknown
$p$-dimensional signal lies near the range of an $L$-Lipschitz continuous
generative model with bounded $k$-dimensional inputs. In particular, we
consider two cases when the nonlinear link function is either unknown or known.
For unknown nonlinearity, similarly to \cite{liu2020generalized}, we make the
assumption of sub-Gaussian observations and propose a linear least-squares
estimator. We show that when there is no representation error and the sensing
vectors are Gaussian, roughly $O(k \log L)$ samples suffice to ensure that a
PGD algorithm converges linearly to a point achieving the optimal statistical
rate using arbitrary initialization. For known nonlinearity, we assume
monotonicity as in \cite{yang2016sparse}, and make much weaker assumptions on
the sensing vectors and allow for representation error. We propose a nonlinear
least-squares estimator that is guaranteed to enjoy an optimal statistical
rate. A corresponding PGD algorithm is provided and is shown to also converge
linearly to the estimator using arbitrary initialization. In addition, we
present experimental results on image datasets to demonstrate the performance
of our PGD algorithms.

cocycles in the spectral action and one-loop quantization. We show that the
spectral action, when perturbed by a gauge potential, can be written as a
series of Chern-Simons actions and Yang-Mills actions of all orders. In the odd
orders, generalized Chern-Simons forms are integrated against an odd
$(b,B)$-cocycle, whereas, in the even orders, powers of the curvature are
integrated against $(b,B)$-cocycles that are Hochschild cocycles as well. In
both cases, the Hochschild cochains are derived from the Taylor series
expansion of the spectral action Tr$(f(D+V))$ in powers of $V=\pi_D(A)$, but
unlike the Taylor expansion we expand in increasing order of the forms in $A$.
We then analyze the perturbative quantization of the spectral action in
noncommutative geometry and establish its one-loop renormalizability as a gauge
theory. We show that the one-loop counterterms are of the same
Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills form so that they can be safely subtracted from the
spectral action. A crucial role will be played by the appropriate Ward
identities, allowing for a fully spectral formulation of the quantum theory at
one loop.

performance of online optimization algorithms for distributed, multi-agent

significantly impact decisions and requires consensus among agents. Moreover,
most existing works have focused on developing approaches for (either strongly
or non-strongly) convex losses, and very few results have been obtained
regarding regret bounds in distributed online optimization for general
non-convex losses. To address these two issues, we propose a novel composite
regret with a new network regret-based metric to evaluate distributed online
optimization algorithms. We concretely define static and dynamic forms of the
composite regret. By leveraging the dynamic form of our composite regret, we
develop a consensus-based online normalized gradient (CONGD) approach for
pseudo-convex losses, and it provably shows a sublinear behavior relating to a
regularity term for the path variation of the optimizer. For general non-convex
losses, we first shed light on the regret for the setting of distributed online
non-convex learning based on recent advances such that no deterministic
algorithm can achieve the sublinear regret. We then develop the distributed
online non-convex optimization with composite regret (DINOCO) without access to
the gradients, depending on an offline optimization oracle. DINOCO is shown to
achieve sublinear regret; to our knowledge, this is the first regret bound for
general distributed online non-convex learning.

centralized learning, and centralized training for decentralized execution.

fields were used to prepare stripe domain structures and various damping

resonant frequency and relaxation time of spin precession clearly characterized
the change in spin dynamics with the magnetic field and damping constant. The
common input signal for reservoir computing was a 1 GHz cosine wave with random

was obtained from time-series signals at the 120 output detectors under each of
the three magnetic field conditions. Then, 240- and 360-dimensional reservoir
output vectors were also constructed by concatenating two and three basic ones,

tasks, the computational performance was enhanced as the dimension of the
reservoir output vector becomes higher and a significantly low prediction error
was achieved for the 10th-order NARMA using the 360-dimensional vector and
optimum damping constant. The results are clear evidence that the collection of

recognized as a solution due to its accuracy and interpretability. As a recent

machine learning methods have better predictive power, they are often
considered to lack interpretability by financial regulators. Thus, they have
not been widely applied in credit risk assessment. We introduce a neural

distinguishing whether the datasets can be explained by the linear models or

for this purpose a novel hybrid multi-observer, which consists of the nominal
one and a bank of additional observer-like systems, that are collectively
referred to as modes and that differ from the nominal observer only in their
output injection gains. We then evaluate on-line the estimation cost of each

that requires agents to (1) extract key events in completing the dish and (2)

captioning (DVC), which aims at detecting events thoroughly and generating
sentences for them. However, unlike DVC, in recipe generation, recipe story
awareness is crucial, and a model should output an appropriate number of key
events in the correct order. We analyze the output of the DVC model and observe
that although (1) several events are adoptable as a recipe story, (2) the
generated sentences for such events are not grounded in the visual content.
Based on this, we hypothesize that we can obtain correct recipes by selecting
oracle events from the output events of the DVC model and re-generating
sentences for them. To achieve this, we propose a novel transformer-based joint
approach of training event selector and sentence generator for selecting oracle
events from the outputs of the DVC model and generating grounded sentences for
the events, respectively. In addition, we extend the model by including
ingredients to generate more accurate recipes. The experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art DVC models. We also
confirm that, by modeling the recipe in a story-aware manner, the proposed
model output the appropriate number of events in the correct order.

techniques for simulating plasmas are often particle-based, a grid-based direct
kinetic solver confers advantages in such a transient and inhomogeneous problem
by eliminating statistical noise. A direct kinetic solver including
interparticle collisions is employed on a plume expansion model problem
spanning one dimension each in configuration and velocity space. The high
degree of thermodynamic nonequilibrium inherent in plume expansion is
characterized, justifying the need for a kinetic rather than a hybrid or fluid
solver. Thruster-relevant metrics such as the momentum flux are also computed.
The plume dynamics are observed to be highly inhomogeneous in space with
insufficient time for thermalization in the region preceding the expansion
front, and the theoretical possibility of reducing the local grid resolution by
up to two orders of magnitude at the far end of the domain is established.
These grid-point requirements are verified via the employment of nonuniform
grids of various expansion ratios, several of which also employ coarsening in
velocity space. Longer domain lengths are explored to characterize
thruster-scale phenomena and larger ambient pressures are simulated as a
testbed to probe facility effects due to collisions with background particles.

world, notably South Asia. Policymakers, practitioners and researchers have
invested in both measuring impacts and developing interventions to reduce

interventions to reduce burning requires data on where burning occurred. These
data are challenging to collect in the field, both in terms of cost and
feasibility. We take advantage of data from ground-based monitoring of crop
residue burning in Punjab, India to explore whether burning can be detected
more effectively using accessible satellite imagery. Specifically, we used 3m
PlanetScope data with high temporal resolution (up to daily) as well as
publicly-available Sentinel-2 data with weekly temporal resolution but greater
depth of spectral information. Following an analysis of the ability of
different spectral bands and burn indices to separate burned and unburned plots
individually, we built a Random Forest model with those determined to provide
the greatest separability and evaluated model performance with ground-verified
data. Our overall model accuracy of 82-percent is favorable given the
challenges presented by the measurement. Based on insights from this process,
we discuss technical challenges of detecting crop residue burning from

  Demonstration for Robotic Cloth Manipulation","Accepted by Robotics and Autonomous Systems",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) can learn policies without
explicitly defining the reward function from demonstrations. GAIL has the
potential to learn policies with high-dimensional observations as input, e.g.,
images. By applying GAIL to a real robot, perhaps robot policies can be
obtained for daily activities like washing, folding clothes, cooking, and
cleaning. However, human demonstration data are often imperfect due to
mistakes, which degrade the performance of the resulting policies. We address
this issue by focusing on the following features: 1) many robotic tasks are
goal-reaching tasks, and 2) labeling such goal states in demonstration data is
relatively easy. With these in mind, this paper proposes Goal-Aware Generative
Adversarial Imitation Learning (GA-GAIL), which trains a policy by introducing
a second discriminator to distinguish the goal state in parallel with the first
discriminator that indicates the demonstration data. This extends a standard
GAIL framework to more robustly learn desirable policies even from imperfect
demonstrations through a goal-state discriminator that promotes achieving the
goal state. Furthermore, GA-GAIL employs the Entropy-maximizing Deep P-Network
(EDPN) as a generator, which considers both the smoothness and causal entropy
in the policy update, to achieve stable policy learning from two
discriminators. Our proposed method was successfully applied to two
real-robotic cloth-manipulation tasks: turning a handkerchief over and folding
clothes. We confirmed that it learns cloth-manipulation policies without
task-specific reward function design. Video of the real experiments are

structures in the solar chromosphere. Given that the thermal interplay across
the transition region is a key to coronal heating, it is worth investigating
how different thermal structures of the chromosphere yield different coronal
properties. In this work, by MHD simulations of Alfv\'{e}n-wave heating of
coronal loops, we study how the coronal properties are affected by the
chromospheric temperature. To this end, instead of solving the radiative
transfer equation, we employ a simple radiative loss function so that the
chromospheric temperature is easily tuned. When the chromosphere is hotter,
because the chromosphere extends to a larger height, the coronal part of the
magnetic loop becomes shorter, which enhances the conductive cooling. A larger
loop length is therefore required to maintain the high-temperature corona
against the thermal conduction. From our numerical simulations we derive a
condition for the coronal formation with respect to the half loop length
$l_{\rm loop}$ in a simple form: $l_{\rm loop} > a T_{\rm min} + l_{\rm th}$,
where $T_{\rm min}$ is the minimum temperature in the atmosphere and parameters
$a$ and $l_{\rm th}$ have negative dependencies on the coronal field strength.
Our conclusion is that the chromospheric temperature has a non-negligible
impact on coronal heating for loops with small length and weak coronal field.
In particular, the enhanced chromospheric heating could prevent the formation
of the corona.

major challenge but is needed to advance our understanding of cosmology. In
this paper we explore how the synergies between narrow-band photometric data
and large imaging surveys can be exploited to improve broadband photometric
redshifts. We used a multi-task learning (MTL) network to improve broadband
photo-z estimates by simultaneously predicting the broadband photo-z and the
narrow-band photometry from the broadband photometry. The narrow-band
photometry is only required in the training field, which also enables better
photo-z predictions for the galaxies without narrow-band photometry in the wide
field. This technique was tested with data from the Physics of the Accelerating
Universe Survey (PAUS) in the COSMOS field. We find that the method predicts
photo-zs that are 13% more precise down to magnitude i_{AB} < 23; the outlier
rate is also 40% lower when compared to the baseline network.
  Furthermore, MTL reduces the photo-z bias for high-redshift galaxies,
improving the redshift distributions for tomographic bins with z>1. Applying
this technique to deeper samples is crucial for future surveys such as \Euclid
or LSST. For simulated data, training on a sample with i_{AB} <23, the method
reduces the photo-z scatter by 16% for all galaxies with i_{AB}<25. We also
studied the effects of extending the training sample with photometric galaxies
using PAUS high-precision photo-zs, which reduces the photo-z scatter by 20% in
the COSMOS field.

the polynomial of interest is obtained by truncating an infinite polynomial

limit as the degree $d\to \infty$. While the phase factors are generally not
unique, we find that there exists a consistent choice of parameterization so
that the limit is well defined in the $\ell^1$ space. This generalization of
QSP, called the infinite quantum signal processing, can be used to represent a
large class of non-polynomial functions. Our analysis reveals a surprising
connection between the regularity of the target function and the decay
properties of the phase factors. Our analysis also inspires a very simple and
efficient algorithm to approximately compute the phase factors in the $\ell^1$

provably converges when the $\ell^1$ norm of the Chebyshev coefficients of the

physics remains elusive. Here, we show that the NHSE can be engineered in the
mesoscopic heterojunctions (system plus reservoir) in which electrons in two
channels of the system moving towards each other have asymmetric coupling to
those of the reservoir. This makes electrons in the system moving forward and
in the opposite direction have unequal lifetimes, and so gives rise to a
point-gap spectral topology. Accordingly, the electron eigenstates exhibit NHSE
under the open boundary condition, consistent with the description of the

itself as the nonreciprocal charge current that can be probed by the standard
transport measurements. Further, we generalize the scenario to the
spin-resolved NHSE, which can be probed by the nonreciprocal spin transport.
Our work opens a new research avenue for implementing and detecting the NHSE in
electronic mesoscopic systems, which will lead to interesting device
applications.

caused by the arrival of vast experimental information on exotic states in the
spectrum of charmonium and bottomonium. Most of such states have properties at
odds with the predictions of the quark model and reside very close to strong
hadronic thresholds. Prominent examples are provided by the glorious $X(3872)$
charmonium-like state and the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}^+$ with the
masses within less than 1 MeV from the $D\bar{D}^*$ and $DD^*$ open-charm
thresholds, respectively. The universality of this feature hints towards the
existence of a general pattern for such exotic states. In this work we discuss
a possible generic mechanism for the formation of near-threshold molecular
states as a result of the strong coupling of compact quark states with a
hadronic continuum channel. The compact states that survive the strong coupling
limit decouple from the continuum channel and therefore also from the formed
hadronic molecule - if realised this scenario would provide a justification to
treat hadronic molecules isolated, ignoring the possible influence from
surrounding, compact quark-model states. We confront the phenomenology of the
$D_{s1}(2460)$ and $D_{s1}(2536)$ with this picture and find consistency,
although other explanations remain possible for those states.

pose huge threats to benign users. Recent semi-supervised GAD methods, which
can effectively leverage the available labels as prior knowledge, have achieved
superior performances than unsupervised methods. In practice, people usually
need to identify anomalies on new (sub)graphs to secure their business, but
they may lack labels to train an effective detection model. One natural idea is
to directly adopt a trained GAD model to the new (sub)graph for testing.
However, we find that existing semi-supervised GAD methods suffer from poor
generalization issue, i.e., well-trained models could not perform well on an
unseen area (i.e., not accessible in training) of the same graph. It may cause
great troubles. In this paper, we base on the phenomenon and propose a general
and novel research problem of generalized graph anomaly detection that aims to
effectively identify anomalies on both the training-domain graph and unseen
testing graph to eliminate potential dangers. Nevertheless, it is a challenging
task since only limited labels are available, and the normal background may
differ between training and testing data. Accordingly, we propose a data
augmentation method named \textit{AugAN} (\uline{Aug}mentation for
\uline{A}nomaly and \uline{N}ormal distributions) to enrich training data and
boost the generalizability of GAD models. Experiments verify the effectiveness
of our method in improving model generalizability.

emotions in videos through text, speech, and rich facial expressions.
Multimodal video emotion analysis techniques can help understand users' inner
world automatically based on human expressions and gestures in images, tones in
voices, and recognized natural language. However, in the existing research, the
acoustic modality has long been in a marginal position as compared to visual
and textual modalities. That is, it tends to be more difficult to improve the
contribution of the acoustic modality for the whole multimodal emotion
recognition task. Besides, although better performance can be obtained by
introducing common deep learning methods, the complex structures of these
training models always result in low inference efficiency, especially when
exposed to high-resolution and long-length videos. Moreover, the lack of a
fully end-to-end multimodal video emotion recognition system hinders its
application. In this paper, we designed a fully multimodal video-to-emotion

benefits are threefold: (1) The adoption of the hierarchical attention method
upon the sound spectra breaks through the limited contribution of the acoustic
modality and outperforms the existing models' performance on both IEMOCAP and
CMU-MOSEI datasets; (2) the introduction of the idea of multi-scale for visual
extraction while single-branch for inference brings higher efficiency and
maintains the prediction accuracy at the same time; (3) the further integration
of data pre-processing into the aligned multimodal learning model allows the
significant reduction of computational costs and storage space.

We perform a non-perturbative analysis of the neutron-meson coupling and
compute the pairing gap $\Delta_{s}$, the critical density $\rho_{c}$, and the
critical temperature $T_c$ by solving the Dyson-Schwinger equation of the
neutron propagator. We first carry out calculations under the widely used bare
vertex approximation and then incorporate the contribution of the lowest-order
vertex correction. This vertex correction is not negligible even at low
densities and its importance is further enhanced as the density increases. The
transition critical line on density-temperature plane obtained under the bare
vertex approximation is substantially changed after including the vertex
correction. These results indicate that the vertex corrections play a
significant role and need to be seriously taken into account.

learns a model that explicitly predicts how well a 3D urban scene will be
reconstructed from a set of viewpoints. To make such a model trainable and
simultaneously applicable to drone path planning, we simulate the proxy-based
3D scene reconstruction during training to set up the prediction. Specifically,
the neural network we design is trained to predict the scene reconstructability
as a function of the proxy geometry, a set of viewpoints, and optionally a
series of scene images acquired in flight. To reconstruct a new urban scene, we
first build the 3D scene proxy, then rely on the predicted reconstruction
quality and uncertainty measures by our network, based off of the proxy
geometry, to guide the drone path planning. We demonstrate that our data-driven
reconstructability predictions are more closely correlated to the true
reconstruction quality than prior heuristic measures. Further, our learned
predictor can be easily integrated into existing path planners to yield
improvements. Finally, we devise a new iterative view planning framework, based
on the learned reconstructability, and show superior performance of the new
planner when reconstructing both synthetic and real scenes.

distinctly different dynamics: the impulsive stimulated Raman scatting that
relies on the antiferromagnetic order and the ultrafast spin Seebeck effect
that relies on the net magnetization. The total THz spin current dynamics can
thus be manipulated by a medium-strength magnetic field. The controllability of

its convergence to a limiting Gaussian distribution at the standard square root

Therefore, this study proposed ensemble PINNs (E-PINNs) to handle this issue.
The E-PINN uses ensemble statistics of several basic models to provide
uncertainty quantifications for the inverse solution based on the PINN
framework, and it is employed to solve the inverse problems in which the
unknown quantity is propagated through partial differential equations (PDEs),
especially the identification of the unknown field (e.g., space function) of a

suggested method is more than straightforward to implement, and also obtains
high-quality uncertainty estimates of the quantity of interest (QoI) without

the good properties of ensemble learning in field inversion and uncertainty
quantification. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated
through several numerical experiments. To enhance the robustness of models,

are a long standing issue of our understanding of the thermodynamical and
chemical states of the gas. We investigate, here, the formation of CH+ in
turbulent and multiphase environments, where the heating of the gas is almost
solely driven by the photoelectric effect. Methods: The diffuse ISM is
simulated using the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code RAMSES which
self-consistently computes the dynamical and thermal evolution of the gas along
with the time-dependent evolutions of the abundances of H$^+$, H, and H$_2$.
The rest of the chemistry, including the abundance of CH$^+$, is computed in
post-processing, at equilibrium, under the constraint of out-ofequilibrium of
H$^+$, H, and H$_2$. The comparison with the observations is performed taking
into account an often neglected, yet paramount, piece of information, namely
the length of the intercepted diffuse matter along the observed lines of sight.
Results: The quasi totality of the mass of CH$^+$ originates from the unstable
gas, in environments where the kinetic temperature is larger than 600 K, the
density ranges between 0.6 and 10 cm$^{-3}$, the electronic fraction ranges
between 3 x 10$^{-4}$ and 6 x 10$^{-3}$, and the molecular fraction is smaller
than 0.4. Its formation is driven by warm and out-of-equilibrium H$_2$
initially formed in the cold neutral medium (CNM) and injected in more diffuse
environments and even the warm neutral medium (WNM) through a combination of
advection and thermal instability. The simulation which displays the tightest
agreement with the HI-to-H$_2$ transition and the thermal pressure distribution
observed in the Solar Neighborhood is found to naturally reproduce the observed
abundances of CH$^+$, the dispersion of observations, the probability of
occurrence of most of the lines of sight, the fraction of non-detections of
CH$^+$, and the distribution of its line profiles. The amount of CH$^+$ and the
statistical properties of the simulated lines of sight are set by the fraction
of unstable gas rich in H$_2$ which is controlled, on Galactic scales, by the
mean density of the diffuse ISM (or, equivalently, its total mass), the
amplitude of the mean UV radiation field, and the strength of the turbulent
forcing. Conclusions: This work offers a new and natural solution to an 80
years old chemical riddle. The almost ubiquitous presence of CH$^+$ in the
diffuse ISM likely results from the exchanges of matter between the CNM and the
WNM induced by the combination of turbulent advection and thermal instability,
without the need to invoke ambipolar diffusion or regions of intermittent
turbulent dissipation. Through two phase turbulent mixing, CH$^+$ might thus be
a tracer of the H$_2$ mass loss rate of CNM clouds.

  Microarchitecture (MICRO), 2022",,,,"cs.AR cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  DRAM is the building block of modern main memory systems. DRAM cells must be
periodically refreshed to prevent data loss. Refresh operations degrade system
performance by interfering with memory accesses. As DRAM chip density increases
with technology node scaling, refresh operations also increase because: 1) the
number of DRAM rows in a chip increases; and 2) DRAM cells need additional
refresh operations to mitigate bit failures caused by RowHammer, a failure
mechanism that becomes worse with technology node scaling. Thus, it is critical
to enable refresh operations at low performance overhead. To this end, we
propose a new operation, Hidden Row Activation (HiRA), and the HiRA Memory
Controller (HiRA-MC).
  HiRA hides a refresh operation's latency by refreshing a row concurrently
with accessing or refreshing another row within the same bank. Unlike prior
works, HiRA achieves this parallelism without any modifications to
off-the-shelf DRAM chips. To do so, it leverages the new observation that two
rows in the same bank can be activated without data loss if the rows are
connected to different charge restoration circuitry. We experimentally
demonstrate on 56% real off-the-shelf DRAM chips that HiRA can reliably
parallelize a DRAM row's refresh operation with refresh or activation of any of
the 32% of the rows within the same bank. By doing so, HiRA reduces the overall
latency of two refresh operations by 51.4%.
  HiRA-MC modifies the memory request scheduler to perform HiRA when a refresh
operation can be performed concurrently with a memory access or another
refresh. Our system-level evaluations show that HiRA-MC increases system
performance by 12.6% and 3.73x as it reduces the performance degradation due to
periodic refreshes and refreshes for RowHammer protection (preventive
refreshes), respectively, for future DRAM chips with increased density and
RowHammer vulnerability.

efficiency in federated learning (FL) via model quantization. In the proposed
bitwidth FL scheme, edge devices train and transmit quantized versions of their
local FL model parameters to a coordinating server, which aggregates them into
a quantized global model and synchronizes the devices. The goal is to jointly
determine the bitwidths employed for local FL model quantization and the set of
devices participating in FL training at each iteration. We pose this as an
optimization problem that aims to minimize the training loss of quantized FL
under a per-iteration device sampling budget and delay requirement. However,
the formulated problem is difficult to solve without (i) a concrete
understanding of how quantization impacts global ML performance and (ii) the
ability of the server to construct estimates of this process efficiently. To
address the first challenge, we analytically characterize how limited wireless
resources and induced quantization errors affect the performance of the
proposed FL method. Our results quantify how the improvement of FL training
loss between two consecutive iterations depends on the device selection and
quantization scheme as well as on several parameters inherent to the model
being learned. Then, we show that the FL training process can be described as a
Markov decision process and propose a model-based reinforcement learning (RL)
method to optimize action selection over iterations. Compared to model-free RL,
this model-based RL approach leverages the derived mathematical
characterization of the FL training process to discover an effective device
selection and quantization scheme without imposing additional device
communication overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed FL algorithm

differential equations (PDEs) that describe the motion of fluids in many

one hundred years, including the groundbreaking work of Ladyzhenskaya on the
Navier-Stokes equations. However crucial questions such as the existence,
uniqueness and regularity of the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations
remain open. Partly because of this mathematical challenge and partly motivated
by the phenomena of turbulence, insights into the full PDEs have been sought
via the study of simpler approximating systems that retain some of the original
nonlinear features. One such simpler system is an infinite dimensional coupled
set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations referred to a dyadic model. In
this survey we provide a brief overview of dyadic models and describe recent
results. In particular, we discuss results for certain dyadic models in the
context of existence, uniqueness and regularity of solutions.

it as an optimization problem using the generalized median. Previous methods
like the Prototype and Distance-Preserving Embedding methods transform objects
into a vector space, solve the generalized median problem in this space, and
inversely transform back into the original space. Both of these methods have
been successfully applied to a wide range of object domains, where the
generalized median problem has inherent high computational complexity
(typically $\mathcal{NP}$-hard) and therefore approximate solutions are
required. Previously, explicit embedding methods were used in the computation,
which often do not reflect the spatial relationship between objects exactly. In
this work we introduce a kernel-based generalized median framework that is
applicable to both positive definite and indefinite kernels. This framework
computes the relationship between objects and its generalized median in kernel
space, without the need of an explicit embedding. We show that the spatial
relationship between objects is more accurately represented in kernel space
than in an explicit vector space using easy-to-compute kernels, and demonstrate
superior performance of generalized median computation on datasets of three
different domains. A software toolbox resulting from our work is made publicly

dynamical analyses without the need for mathematical modelling. CBC has seen
considerable success in studying the bifurcation structure of mechanical
systems. Nevertheless, the method is not practical for studying relaxation
oscillations. Large numbers of Fourier modes are required to describe them, and
the length of the experiment significantly increases when many Fourier modes
are used, as the system must be run to convergence many times. Furthermore,
relaxation oscillations often arise in autonomous systems, for which an
appropriate phase constraint is required. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce an adaptive B-spline discretisation, that can produce a parsimonious
description of responses that would otherwise require many Fourier modes. We
couple this to a novel phase constraint, that phase-locks control target and

of medical images. Although the self-attention-based Transformer can model
long-range dependencies, it has high computational complexity and lacks local
inductive bias. Much research has demonstrated that global and local features
are crucial for image classification. However, medical images have a lot of
noisy, scattered features, intra-class variation, and inter-class similarities.
This paper proposes a three-branch hierarchical multi-scale feature fusion
network structure termed as HiFuse for medical image classification as a new
method. It can fuse the advantages of Transformer and CNN from multi-scale
hierarchies without destroying the respective modeling so as to improve the
classification accuracy of various medical images. A parallel hierarchy of
local and global feature blocks is designed to efficiently extract local
features and global representations at various semantic scales, with the
flexibility to model at different scales and linear computational complexity
relevant to image size. Moreover, an adaptive hierarchical feature fusion block
(HFF block) is designed to utilize the features obtained at different
hierarchical levels comprehensively. The HFF block contains spatial attention,
channel attention, residual inverted MLP, and shortcut to adaptively fuse
semantic information between various scale features of each branch. The

chemical composition observed in a sample of classical metal-poor stars, and
(ii) the abundances observed in the second generation stars of GCs. Results. In
metal-poor N-rich stars C and O are slightly deficient but the scatter of
[(C+N+O)/Fe] is very small, a strong indication that the N enrichment is the
result of a pollution by CNO processed material. The N-rich stars of our
sample, like the second generation stars in the GCs, show an excess of Na and
sometimes of Al, as expected if the material from which these stars were
formed, has been polluted by the ejecta of massive AGB stars. For the first

like the one observed in NGC6752. The N-rich star HD 74000 has a rather low
[Eu/Ba] ratio for its metallicity. Such an anomaly is also observed in several
second generation stars of M15. Conclusions. This analysis supports the
hypothesis that the N-rich stars today observed in the field, were born as

fairness, the existing mainstream approaches mostly require retraining or
finetuning the entire weights of the neural network to meet the fairness
criteria. However, this is often infeasible in practice for those large-scale
trained models due to large computational and storage costs, low data
efficiency, and model privacy issues. In this paper, we propose a new generic
fairness learning paradigm, called FairReprogram, which incorporates the model
reprogramming technique. Specifically, FairReprogram considers the case where
models can not be changed and appends to the input a set of perturbations,
called the fairness trigger, which is tuned towards the fairness criteria under
a min-max formulation. We further introduce an information-theoretic framework
that explains why and under what conditions fairness goals can be achieved
using the fairness trigger. We show both theoretically and empirically that the
fairness trigger can effectively obscure demographic biases in the output
prediction of fixed ML models by providing false demographic information that
hinders the model from utilizing the correct demographic information to make
the prediction. Extensive experiments on both NLP and CV datasets demonstrate
that our method can achieve better fairness improvements than retraining-based
methods with far less data dependency under two widely-used fairness criteria.

annotations of emotion to provide fine-grained descriptions of spontaneous
expressions as observed in real-life interactions. As emotion is rather
subjective, its annotation is usually performed by several annotators who
provide a trace for a given dimension, i.e. a time-continuous series describing
a dimension such as arousal or valence. However, annotations of the same
expression are rarely consistent between annotators, either in time or in
value, which adds bias and delay in the trace that is used to learn predictive
models of emotion. We therefore propose a method that can dynamically
compensate inconsistencies across annotations and synchronise the traces with
the corresponding acoustic features using Recurrent Neural Networks.
Experimental evaluations were carried on several emotion data sets that include
Chinese, French, German, and Hungarian participants who interacted remotely in
either noise-free conditions or in-the-wild. The results show that our method
can significantly increase inter-annotator agreement, as well as correlation
between traces and audio features, for both arousal and valence. In addition,
improvements are obtained in the automatic prediction of these dimensions using
simple light-weight models, especially for valence in noise-free conditions,
and arousal for recordings captured in-the-wild.

users will make file requests in the delivery phase. Hence, we propose a new
D2D centralized coded caching problem, named the 3-user D2D coded caching with
two random requesters and one sender (2RR1S), where in the delivery phase, any
two of the three users will make file requests, and the user that does not make
any file request is the designated sender. We find the optimal caching and
delivery scheme, denoted as the 2RRIS scheme, for any number of files N by
proving matching converse and achievability results. It is shown that coded
cache placement is needed to achieve the optimal performance. Furthermore, the
optimal rate-memory tradeoff has a uniform expression for N>=4 and different
expressions for N=2 and 3.
  To examine the usefulness of the proposed model and scheme, we adapt the
2RR1S scheme to two scenarios. The first one is the 3-user D2D coded caching
model proposed by Ji et al. By characterizing the optimal rate-memory tradeoff
for the 3-user D2D coded caching when N=2, which was previously unknown, we
show that the adapted 2RR1S scheme is in fact optimal for the 3-user D2D coded
caching problem when N=2 and the cache size is medium. The benefit comes from
coded cache placement which is missing from existing D2D coded caching schemes.
The second scenario is where in the delivery phase, each user makes a file
request randomly and independently with the same probability p. We call this
model the request-random D2D coded caching problem. Adapting the 2RR1S scheme
to this scenario, we show the superiority of our adapted scheme over other
existing D2D coded caching schemes for medium to large cache size.

fundamental theoretical and practical importance; the opposite of purifying is

Abstract presented at EURO 2022 (Espoo, Finland)",,,,"cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Social networks are the natural space for the spreading of information and
influence and have become a media themselves. Several models capturing that
diffusion process have been proposed, most of them based on the Independent
Cascade (IC) model or on the Linear Threshold (LT) model. The IC model is
probabilistic while the LT model relies on the knowledge of an actor to be
convinced, reflected in an associated individual threshold.
  Although the LT-based models contemplate an individual threshold for each
actor in the network, the existing studies so far have always considered a
threshold of 0.5 equal in all actors (i.e., a simple majority activation
criterion).
  Our main objective in this work is to start the study on how the
dissemination of information on networks behaves when we consider other options
for setting those thresholds and how many network actors end up being
influenced by this dissemination. For doing so, we consider a recently
introduced centrality measure based on the LT model, the Forward Linear
Threshold Rank (FLTR). We analyze experimentally the ranking properties for
several networks in which the influence resistance threshold follows different
schemes. Here we consider three different schemes: (1) uniform, in which all
players have the same value; (2) random, where each player is assigned a
threshold u.a.r. in a prescribed interval; and (3) determined by the value of
another centrality measure on the actor. Our results show that the selection
has a clear impact on the ranking, even quite significant and abrupt in some
cases. We conclude that the social networks ranks that provide the best
assignments for the individual thresholds are PageRank and FLTR.

existence of new physics beyond standard model. The presence of small neutrino
mass is indispensable to explicate the oscillation among different flavours of
neutrino. By the addition of a right handed neutral lepton with the standard
model fermions, it is possible to generate tiny neutrino mass. Such additional
fermion may induce non-unitarity to the $3\times 3$ PMNS mixing matrix which
influences the propagation of neutrino in space-time. In this work the effect
of non-unitary mixing matrix is analyzed in neutrino oscillation in presence of
two new physics scenarios, Lorentz violation and dark non-standard interaction.
Lorentz symmetry violation mainly appears at the Planck scale, which may also
be manifested at a lower energy level. On the other hand, dark non standard
interaction arises due to the interaction of neutrino with the environmental
dark matter which contributes as a perturbative correction to the neutrino
mass. In this analysis, the comparative study of unitary and non-unitary mixing
matrix is carried out considering the scenario of Lorentz violation and dark
NSI in the context of long baseline DUNE and short baseline Daya Bay
experimental set up. The signature of dark nonstandard interaction is
observable in both DUNE and Daya Bay set up in terms of large value of neutrino
survival and oscillation probability respectively and is a possible explanation
for the excess flux observed at $\sim5$ MeV in Daya Bay experiment. The
signature of Lorentz violation is also possible to be observed in the short
baseline Daya Bay experiment only.

QCD Lagrangian. In this regime the medium consists of the chirally symmetric
and approximately chiral spin symmetric hadrons that are made of the chirally
symmetric quarks connected into the color singlet compounds by a confining
chromoelectric field. This regime is evidenced by the approximate chiral spin
symmetry of the spatial and temporal correlators and by the breakdown of the
thermal perturbation theory at the crossover between the partonic (the
quark-gluon plasma) and stringy fluid regimes at ~ 3 T_{ch}. The chiral spin
symmetry smoothly disappears above ~ 3T_{ch} which means that the
chromoelectric confining interaction gets screened. A direct evidence that the
stringy fluid medium consists of densely packed hadrons is the pion spectral
function that shows a distinct pion state and its first radial excitation above

swimming motion at intermediate times, and the transition to complete

smartphone microphones recording a robot in operation to exploit acoustic
properties of the sound to fingerprint a robot's movements. In this work we
consider the possibility of an insider adversary who is within physical
proximity of a robotic system (such as a technician or robot operator),
equipped with only their smartphone microphone. Through the acoustic
side-channel, we demonstrate that it is indeed possible to fingerprint not only
individual robot movements within 3D space, but also patterns of movements
which could lead to inferring the purpose of the movements (i.e. surgical
procedures which a surgical robot is undertaking) and hence, resulting in
potential privacy violations. Upon evaluation, we find that individual robot
movements can be fingerprinted with around 75% accuracy, decreasing slightly
with more fine-grained movement meta-data such as distance and speed.
Furthermore, workflows could be reconstructed with around 62% accuracy as a
whole, with more complex movements such as pick-and-place or packing
reconstructed with near perfect accuracy. As well as this, in some environments
such as surgical settings, audio may be recorded and transmitted over VoIP,
such as for education/teaching purposes or in remote telemedicine. The question
here is, can the same attack be successful even when VoIP communication is
employed, and how does packet loss impact the captured audio and the success of
the attack? Using the same characteristics of acoustic sound for plain audio
captured by the smartphone, the attack was 90% accurate in fingerprinting VoIP
samples on average, 15% higher than the baseline without the VoIP codec
employed. This opens up new research questions regarding anonymous

interactions is not only interesting from the fundamental perspective of
understanding complex systems, but also proposes unprecedented computational
challenges. In this work, we focus on the problem of counting occurrences of
sub-hypergraph patterns in very large higher-order networks. We show that, by
directly exploiting higher-order structures, we speed up the counting process
compared to applying traditional data mining techniques for network motifs.
Moreover, by including hyperedge sampling techniques, computational complexity
is further reduced at the cost of small errors in the estimation of motif

mean stellar age and metallicity and stellar mass. After analysing the
correlations among these characteristics, we look for possible dependencies of
the Hubble diagram residuals and supernova features (luminosity, color and

computer architecture brings a new paradigm called Accelerator Level
Parallelism (ALP). In ALP, accelerators are used concurrently to provide
unprecedented levels of performance and energy efficiency. To reach that, there
are many problems to be solved, one of the most challenging being co-execution.
  This paper develops a scheduling framework called POAS, a general method for
providing co-execution to generic applications. Unlike other scheduling
approaches, POAS does not directly schedule applications. Instead, it is a
generic model that transforms any application to make it suitable for
co-execution, so that it can be executed in ALP environments. Our proposal is
composed of four differentiated steps: predict, optimize, adapt and schedule.
During these phases, different modifications are implemented in the application
to make it suitable to be executed in ALP environments. In this work we also
apply our framework to a matrix multiplication case study, outlining the
critical and most important steps to port the application with POAS.
  We evaluate our POAS-based implementation for matrix multiplication on a
CPU/GPU/XPU environment using CPU cores, CUDA cores and tensor cores (XPU). Our
experiments prove that co-execution in the studied scenario can benefit from
ALP, yielding speedups of up to 45% with respect to using only one accelerator.
The proven flexibility and potential of POAS make it an excellent candidate to
reach ALP in future computer systems.

Intuitively, leveraging temporal multi-view stereo (MVS) technology is the

MVS are flawed in two aspects when applying to 3D object detection scenes: 1)
The affinity measurement among all views suffers expensive computation cost; 2)
It is difficult to deal with outdoor scenarios where objects are often mobile.
To this end, we introduce an effective temporal stereo method to dynamically
select the scale of matching candidates, enable to significantly reduce
computation overhead. Going one step further, we design an iterative algorithm
to update more valuable candidates, making it adaptive to moving candidates. We
instantiate our proposed method to multi-view 3D detector, namely BEVStereo.

Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) measured the cooling of a muon beam
traversing a liquid hydrogen or lithium hydride (LiH) energy absorber as part

  inference",,,,,"stat.ME q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  1. Bayesian inference is difficult because it often requires time consuming
tuning of samplers. Differential evolution Monte-Carlo (DEMC) is a self-tuning
multi-chain sampling approach which requires minimal input from the operator as
samples are obtained by taking the difference of the current position of
multiple randomly selected chains. However, this can also make DEMC more
computationally intensive than single chain samplers. 2. We provide a
single-chain adaptation of the DEMC algorithm by taking samples according to
the difference in previous states of the chain, rather than the current state
of multiple chains. This minimises computational costs by requiring only one
posterior evaluation per step, while retaining the self-adaptive property of
DEMC. We test the algorithm by sampling a bivariate normal distribution and by
estimating the posterior distribution of parameters of an ODE model fitted to
an artificial prey-predator time series. In both cases we compare the quality
of DEMC generated samples to those obtained by a standard adaptive Markov chain
Monte-Carlo sampler (AMC). 3. In both case studies, DEMC is as accurate as AMC
in estimating posterior distributions, while being an order of magnitude faster
due to simpler computations. DEMC also provides a higher effective samples size
than AMC, and lower initial samples autocorrelations. 4. Its low computational
cost and self-adaptive property make single chain DEMC particularly suitable
for fitting models that are costly to evaluate, such as ODE models. The
simplicity of the algorithm also makes it easy to implement in base R, hence
offering a simple alternative to STAN.

conflict of predicates (guards) between transitions in the path. Therefore, in
order to derive feasible test cases, a test generation algorithm needs to
dynamically acquire information about the model and verify the feasibility of
the generated test path through the simulation execution of the model. The
traditional method of constructing executable models using hard-coding for
different EFSM models under test has limitations such as inflexibility,
time-consuming and error-prone. To address this issue, this paper develops an
open source test generation tool for testing EFSM-specified systems, PTSG, to
support the automatic generation of executable test cases. It decouples the
EFSM model description, parsing and simulation execution functions from the
test generation algorithm, which can effectively improve the efficiency and
quality of test generation. In particular, PTSG first uses a well-designed JSON
syntax to describe the specific EFSM under test. Then, based on the model
description file, it uses lexical and syntactic parsers to dynamically extract
model information to construct various model objects in memory such as state
configurations, transitions, etc. Finally, the tool provide a series of service
interfaces to support model information acquisition, transition feasibility
evaluation, and model simulation execution. A case study of test sequence
generation for the SCP protocol model demonstrates the capability and promise
of the PTSG to serve executable test cases.

  from Norway","55 pages, 58 figures",,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It has long been assumed that inheritances, particularly large ones, have a
negative effect on the labor supply of inheritors. Using Norwegian registry
data, I examine the inheritance-induced decline in inheritors' wages and
occupational income. In contrast to prior research, my estimates allow the
dynamic effect of inheritances on labor supply to vary among inheritor cohorts.
The estimation approach adopted and the 25-year long panel data make it
possible to trace the dynamics of the effect for at least 20 years, which is
twice as long as the study period in previous studies. Since all observations
in the sample are inheritors, I avoid the selection problem arising in studies
employing non-inheritors as controls. I find that large parental inheritances
(more than one million Norwegian kroner) reduce annual wage and occupational
income by, at most, 4.3%, which is about half the decrease previously
identified. The magnitude of the effect increases with the size of the
inheritance. Large inheritances also increase the probability of being
self-employed by more than 1%, although entrepreneurship may be dampened by
inheritances that are excessively large. The inheritance effect lasts for up to
10 years and is heterogeneous across sexes and age groups. Male heirs are more
likely to reduce their labor supply after receiving the transfer. Young heirs
are more likely to be self-employed, and their annual occupational income is,
therefore, less affected by inheritances in the long run; for the very young
inheriting large amounts of wealth from their grandparents, the probability of
their attaining a post-secondary education declines by 2%.

minimum number of edges (in particular, $H$ remains connected after the removal
of one arbitrary edge).
  2-ECSS is NP-hard and the best-known (polynomial-time) approximation factor
for this problem is $4/3$. Interestingly, this factor was achieved with
drastically different techniques by [Hunkenschr{\""o}der, Vempala and Vetta

2-vertex-connected graphs is trivial (and heavily used in prior work), our

the delocalized phase the observation entropy grows rapidly with coarse-grain
size and saturates to the maximal value, while in the localized phase the
growth is logarithmic. Moreover, for a given coarse-graining, it increases
logarithmically with system size in the delocalized phase, and obeys area law
in the localized phase. We also find the increase of the observational entropy

  clock isomer",,,,,"nucl-ex","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The nucleus of the radioisotope thorium-229 (${}^{229}$Th) features an isomer
with an exceptionally low excitation energy that enables direct laser
manipulation of nuclear states. For this reason, it is a leading candidate for
use in next-generation optical clocks. This nuclear clock will be a unique
tool, amongst others, for tests of fundamental physics. While first indirect
experimental evidence for the existence of such an extraordinary nuclear state
is significantly older, the proof of existence has been delivered only recently
by observing the isomer's electron conversion decay and its hyperfine structure
in a laser spectroscopy study, revealing information on the isomer's excitation
energy, nuclear spin and electromagnetic moments. Further studies reported the
electron conversion lifetime and refined the isomer's energy. In spite of
recent progress, the isomer's radiative decay, a key ingredient for the
development of a nuclear clock, remained unobserved.
  In this Letter, we report the detection of the radiative decay of this
low-energy isomer in thorium-229 (${}^{229\mathrm{m}}$Th). By performing
vacuum-ultraviolet spectroscopy of ${}^{229\mathrm{m}}$Th incorporated into
large-bandgap CaF${}_2$ and MgF${}_2$ crystals at the ISOLDE facility at CERN,
the photon vacuum wavelength of the isomer's decay is measured as 148.71(42)
nm, corresponding to an excitation energy of 8.338(24) eV. This value is in
agreement with recent measurements, and decreases the uncertainty by a factor
of seven. The half-life of ${}^{229\mathrm{m}}$Th embedded in MgF${}_2$ is
determined to be 670(102) s. The observation of the radiative decay in a
large-bandgap crystal has important consequences for the design of a future
nuclear clock and the improved uncertainty of the energy eases the search for
direct laser excitation of the atomic nucleus.

variability is linked to the cloud size distribution. Cloud shadow sizes are
distributed according to a power law over multiple orders of magnitude,
deviating only from the cloud size distribution due to cloud edge transparency

frequently as shadows, and is similarly driven mostly by boundary layer clouds,
but distributed over a smaller range of scales. We reconcile studies of solar
irradiance variability with those on clouds, which brings fundamental
understanding to what drives irradiance variability. Our findings have

using massive unlabeled high-quality data from the new environment, which is

AirFi is a novel domain generalization framework that learns the critical part

environment. AirFi extracts the common features from several training
environment settings and minimizes the distribution differences among them. The
feature is further augmented to be more robust to environments. Moreover, the
system can be further improved by few-shot learning techniques. Compared to
state-of-the-art methods, AirFi is able to work in different environment
settings without acquiring any CSI data from the new environment. The
experimental results demonstrate that our system remains robust in the new

interior spacetime whereas the matter source is assumed to be anisotropic
fluid. We show that all physical quantities inside the star can be expressed in
terms of Rastall, $\epsilon$, and compactness, $C=2GM/Rc^2$, parameters. Using
NICER and X-ray Multi-Mirror X-ray observational constraints on the mass and
radius of the pulsar PSR J0740+6620 we determine Rastall parameter to be at
most $\epsilon=0.041$ in the positive range. The obtained solution provides a
stable compact object; in addition the squared sound speed does not violate the
conjectured sound speed $c_s^2\leq c^2/3$ unlike the general relativistic
treatment. We note that no equations of state are assumed; the model however
fits well with linear patterns with bag constants. In general, for
$\epsilon>0$, the theory predicts a slightly larger size star in comparison to
general relativity for the same mass. This has been explained as an additional
force, due to matter-geometry coupling, in the hydrodynamic equilibrium
equation, which contributes to partially diminish the gravitational force
effect. Consequently, we calculate the maximal compactness as allowed by the
strong energy condition to be $C = 0.735$ which is $\sim 2\%$ higher than

probes arguably ultimate limits of the angular momentum dynamics in solid.
Unfortunately, many aspects of the dynamics remain unclear except that the
demagnetization transfers the angular momentum eventually to the lattice. In
particular, roles of electron-carried spin current are debated. Here we
experimentally probe the spin current in the opposite phenomenon, i.e.,
laser-induced ultrafast magnetization of FeRh, where the laser pump pulse
initiates the angular momentum build-up rather than its dissipation. Using the
time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect, we directly measure the
ultrafast-magnetization-driven spin current in a FeRh/Cu heterostructure.
Strong correlation between the spin current and the net magnetization change
rate of FeRh is found even though the spin filter effect is negligible in this
opposite process. This result implies that the angular momentum build-up is
achieved by an angular momentum transfer from the electron bath (supplier) to
the magnon bath (receiver) and followed by the spatial transport of angular
momentum (spin current) and dissipation of angular momentum to the phonon bath
(spin relaxation).

cardinality, but in guard sets with largest possible distances between these

before.We call it the Dispersive Art Gallery Problem. In particular, in the
dispersive art gallery problem we are given a polygon $\mathcal{P}$ and a real
number $\ell$, and want to decide whether $\mathcal{P}$ has a guard set such
that every pair of guards in this set is at least a distance of $\ell$ apart.
  In this paper, we study the vertex guard variant of this problem for the
class of polyominoes. We consider rectangular visibility and distances as
geodesics in the $L_1$-metric. Our results are as follows. We give a (simple)
thin polyomino such that every guard set has minimum pairwise distances of at
most $3$. On the positive side, we describe an algorithm that computes guard
sets for simple polyominoes that match this upper bound, i.e., the algorithm
constructs worst-case optimal solutions. We also study the computational
complexity of computing guard sets that maximize the smallest distance between
all pairs of guards within the guard sets. We prove that deciding whether there
exists a guard set realizing a minimum pairwise distance for all pairs of
guards of at least $5$ in a given polyomino is NP-complete.
  We were also able to find an optimal dynamic programming approach that
computes a guard set that maximizes the minimum pairwise distance between
guards in tree-shaped polyominoes, i.e., computes optimal solutions. Because
the shapes constructed in the NP-hardness reduction are thin as well (but have
holes), this result completes the case for thin polyominoes.

collect publicly available data without involving the concerned persons. Hence
we introduce a self-attentive semi-supervised framework for political

that it neither needs huge training data nor does it need to store social

generate compact optical-frequency microcombs, which enable an ever-growing
number of applications. Microcombs exhibit a spectral profile that is primarily
determined by their microresonator's dispersion; an example is the $
\operatorname{sech}^2 $ spectrum of dissipative Kerr solitons under anomalous
group-velocity dispersion. Here, we introduce an inverse-design approach to
spectrally shape microcombs, by optimizing an arbitrary meta-dispersion in a
resonator. We develop a genetic algorithm to efficiently invert the governing
equation of the system. It determines a near-optimal dispersion profile, which
yields a microcomb approaching a user-defined target spectrum, such as
spectrally-flat microcombs, or near-Gaussian pulses. We show a concrete
implementation of these intricate optimized dispersion profiles, using
selective bidirectional-mode hybridization in photonic-crystal resonators.
Moreover, we fabricate and explore several microcomb generators with such
flexible `meta' dispersion control. Their dispersion is not only controlled by
the waveguide composing the resonator, but also by a corrugation inside the
resonator, which geometrically controls the spectral distribution of the
bidirectional coupling in the resonator. This approach provides programmable
mode-by-mode frequency splitting and thus greatly increases the design space
for controlling the nonlinear dynamics of optical states such as Kerr solitons.

  Explained and Applied to the Multi-period Newsvendor Problem","22 pages, 4 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Symmetry breaking is a common approach for model reduction of Markov decision
processes (MDPs). This approach only uses directly accessible symmetries such
as geometric symmetries. For some MDPs, it is possible to transform them
equivalently such that symmetries become accessible -- we call this type of
symmetries hidden symmetries. For these MDPs, hidden symmetries allow
substantially better model reduction compared to directly accessible
symmetries. The main idea is to reveal a hidden symmetry by altering the reward
structure and then exploit the revealed symmetry by forming a quotient MDP. The
quotient MDP is the reduced MDP, since it is sufficient to solve the quotient
MDP instead of the original one. In this paper, we introduce hidden symmetries
and the associated concept of model reduction. We demonstrate this concept on
the multi-period newsvendor problem, which is the newsvendor problem considered
over an infinite number of days. In this way, we show that hidden symmetries
can reduce problems that directly accessible symmetries cannot, and present a
basic idea of revealing hidden symmetries in multi-period problems. The
presented approach can be extended to more sophisticated problems.

problem of blockchain. By establishing channels off the blockchain to form
payment channel networks (PCNs), users can make instant payments without
interacting with the blockchain, avoiding the problems of long transaction
consensus delays and high transaction fees. Recently, the optimization of PCNs
has mainly focused on improving the network throughput via multi-path routing.
However, the transaction's atomicity comes at a non-trivial cost for
transaction completion latency that affects user experience in
deadline-sensitive applications of PCNs. In this paper, we propose a new and
systematic framework DPCN to consider the deadlines of transactions for payment
channel networks while improving the success ratio of transactions. DPCN is
enabled via a synergy of three components: (1) deadline-based dynamic
transaction split mechanism that splits the transaction according to current
network status and the transaction's deadline; (2) deadline-aware transaction
scheduling that prioritizes near-deadline transactions; (3) deadline-aware
transaction congestion avoidance algorithm, which uses a path window to balance
transactions with different deadlines. Our extensive experiments show that
compared with existing methods, DPCN can well meet the needs of transactions
with different deadlines and ensure a higher success ratio for transactions in
the payment channel networks.

of high-dimensional dynamical systems from observations. In this work, we focus
on a combination of delay-coordinates embedding and DMD, i.e.,
delay-coordinates DMD, which accommodates the analysis of a broad family of
observations. An important utility of DMD is the compact and reduced-order
spectral representation of observations in terms of the DMD eigenvalues and
modes, where the temporal information is separated from the spatial
information. From a spatiotemporal viewpoint, we show that when DMD is applied
to delay-coordinates embedding, temporal information is intertwined with
spatial information, inducing a particular spectral structure on the DMD
components. We formulate and analyze this structure, which we term the
spatiotemporal coupling in delay-coordinates DMD. Based on this spatiotemporal
coupling, we propose a new method for DMD components selection. When using
delay-coordinates DMD that comprises redundant modes, this selection is an
essential step for obtaining a compact and reduced-order representation of the
observations. We demonstrate our method on noisy simulated signals and various
dynamical systems and show superior component selection compared to a
commonly-used method that relies on the amplitudes of the modes.

  A step by step construction of the Block-Householder transformation is

a remaining cluster's ""environment"" which is described by so-called core

intermediate neutron capture process (i-process) is thought to exist. It
happens when protons are mixed in a convective helium-burning zone, and is
referred to as proton ingestion event (PIE). A possible astrophysical site is
the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of low-mass low-metallicity stars. We
provide i-process yields of a grid of AGB stars experiencing PIEs. We computed
12 models with initial masses of 1, 2, and 3 $M_{\odot}$ and metallicities of
[Fe/H] $=-3.0$, $-2.5$ $-2.3,$ and $-2.0, $ with the stellar evolution code
STAREVOL. We used a nuclear network of 1160 species at maximum, coupled to the
chemical transport equations. These simulations do not include any extra mixing
process. Proton ingestion takes place in six out of our 12 AGB models. These
models experience i-process nucleosynthesis characterized by neutron densities
of $\simeq 10^{14} -10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$. Depending on the PIE properties two
different evolution paths follow: either the stellar envelope is quickly lost
and no more thermal pulses develop or the AGB phase resumes with additional
thermal pulses. This behaviour critically depends on the pulse number when the
PIE occurs, the mass of the ingested protons, and the extent to which the pulse
material is diluted in the convective envelope. The surface enrichment after a
PIE is a robust feature of our models and it persists under various convective
assumptions. Our models can synthesise heavy elements up to Pb without any
parametrized extra mixing process such as overshoot or inclusion of a
$^{13}$C-pocket. Nevertheless, it remains to be explored how the i-process
depends on mixing processes, such as overshoot, thermohaline, or rotation.

existing methods still rely on human-annotated attributes, which are difficult
to annotate and scale. An unsupervised alternative is to represent each class
using the word embedding associated with its semantic class name. However, word
embeddings extracted from pre-trained language models do not necessarily
capture visual similarities, resulting in poor zero-shot performance. In this
work, we argue that online textual documents, e.g., Wikipedia, contain rich
visual descriptions about object classes, therefore can be used as powerful
unsupervised side information for ZSL. To this end, we propose I2DFormer, a
novel transformer-based ZSL framework that jointly learns to encode images and
documents by aligning both modalities in a shared embedding space. In order to
distill discriminative visual words from noisy documents, we introduce a new
cross-modal attention module that learns fine-grained interactions between
image patches and document words. Consequently, our I2DFormer not only learns
highly discriminative document embeddings that capture visual similarities but
also gains the ability to localize visually relevant words in image regions.
Quantitatively, we demonstrate that our I2DFormer significantly outperforms
previous unsupervised semantic embeddings under both zero-shot and generalized
zero-shot learning settings on three public datasets. Qualitatively, we show
that our method leads to highly interpretable results where document words can
be grounded in the image regions.

physical patterns and the mutually iterative process between blur kernel and HR

automaton (DFA) of a regular language using membership and equivalence queries.
Its probabilistic approximatively correct (PAC) version substitutes an
equivalence query by a large enough set of random membership queries to get a
high level confidence to the answer. Thus it can be applied to any kind of
(also non-regular) device and may be viewed as an algorithm for synthesizing an
automaton abstracting the behavior of the device based on observations. Here we
are interested on how Angluin's PAC learning algorithm behaves for devices
which are obtained from a DFA by introducing some noise. More precisely we
study whether Angluin's algorithm reduces the noise and produces a DFA closer
to the original one than the noisy device. We propose several ways to introduce
the noise: (1) the noisy device inverts the classification of words w.r.t. the
DFA with a small probability, (2) the noisy device modifies with a small
probability the letters of the word before asking its classification w.r.t. the
DFA, and (3) the noisy device combines the classification of a word w.r.t. the
DFA and its classification w.r.t. a counter automaton. Our experiments were
performed on several hundred DFAs.
  Our main contributions, bluntly stated, consist in showing that: (1)
Angluin's algorithm behaves well whenever the noisy device is produced by a
random process, (2) but poorly with a structured noise, and, that (3) almost
surely randomness yields systems with non-recursively enumerable languages.

receptive field sizes while neglecting small receptive fields. Thus, it is a
challenging problem to effectively construct adaptive neural networks for
recognizing various spatial-scale objects. To tackle this issue, we first
introduce a new attention dimension, i.e., depth, in addition to existing
attention dimensions such as channel, spatial, and branch, and present a novel
selective depth attention network to symmetrically handle multi-scale objects
in various vision tasks. Specifically, the blocks within each stage of a given
neural network, i.e., ResNet, output hierarchical feature maps sharing the same
resolution but with different receptive field sizes. Based on this structural
property, we design a stage-wise building module, namely SDA, which includes a
trunk branch and a SE-like attention branch. The block outputs of the trunk
branch are fused to globally guide their depth attention allocation through the
attention branch. According to the proposed attention mechanism, we can
dynamically select different depth features, which contributes to adaptively
adjusting the receptive field sizes for the variable-sized input objects. In
this way, the cross-block information interaction leads to a long-range
dependency along the depth direction. Compared with other multi-scale
approaches, our SDA method combines multiple receptive fields from previous
blocks into the stage output, thus offering a wider and richer range of
effective receptive fields. Moreover, our method can be served as a pluggable
module to other multi-scale networks as well as attention networks, coined as
SDA-$x$Net. Their combination further extends the range of the effective
receptive fields towards small receptive fields, enabling interpretable neural
networks. Our source code is available at

compare half-duplex communication, existential B-boundedness, and
k-synchronisability. These restrictions do not prevent the communication
channels from growing arbitrarily large but still restrict the power of the

Surprisingly, these two contexts yield different conclusions. In addition, we
integrate multiparty session types, another approach to specify communication

Universe, and accurately measuring their total masses allows us to constrain
important cosmological parameters. However, estimating mass from observations
that use different methods and spectral bands introduces various systematic
errors. This paper evaluates the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
reliably and accurately infer the masses of galaxy clusters from the Compton-y
parameter maps provided by the Planck satellite. The CNN is trained with mock
images generated from hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters, with
Planck's observational limitations taken into account. We observe that the CNN
approach is not subject to the usual observational assumptions, and so is not
affected by the same biases. By applying the trained CNNs to the real Planck
maps, we find cluster masses compatible with Planck measurements within a 15%
bias. Finally, we show that this mass bias can be explained by the well known
hydrostatic equilibrium assumption in Planck masses, and the different
parameters in the Y500-M500 scaling laws. This work highlights that CNNs,
supported by hydrodynamic simulations, are a promising and independent tool for
estimating cluster masses with high accuracy, which can be extended to other
surveys as well as to observations in other bands.

undergo a valence transition from nearly divalent to nearly trivalent Eu
accompanied by a volume reduction. Albeit intensive work, its microscopic
origin is still being discussed. Here, we investigate the mechanism of the
valence transition under volume compression by $ab~initio$ density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. Our analysis of the electronic and magnetic
properties of EuPd$_2$Si$_2$ when approaching the valence transition shows an
enhanced $c$-$f$ hybridization between localized Eu 4$f$ states and itinerant
conduction states (Eu 5$d$, Pd 4$d$, and Si 3$p$) where an electronic charge
redistribution takes place. We observe that the change in the electronic
structure is intimately related to the volume reduction where Eu-Pd(Si) bond
lengths shorten and, for the transition to happen, we trace the delicate
balance between electronic bandwidth, crystal field splitting, Coulomb
repulsion, Hund's coupling and spin-orbit coupling. In a next step we compare
and benchmark our DFT results to surface-sensitive photoemission data in which
the mixed-valent properties of EuPd$_2$Si$_2$ are reflected in a simultaneous
observation of divalent and trivalent signals from the Eu $4f$ shell. The study
serves as well to explore the limits of density functional theory and the
choice of exchange correlation functionals to describe such a phenomenon as a
valence transition.

gravitational field sourced by it is probed by another (distant) particle; in
it, this is used to explore a possible tension between complementarity and
causality in case the gravitational field entangles with the superposed
locations, a proposed resolution being graviton emission from quadrupole
moments. Here, we focus on the delocalized particle (forgetting about the probe
and the gedanken experiment) and explore the conditions (in terms of mass,
separation, and recombination time) for graviton emission. Through this, we
find that the variations of quadrupole moments in the recombination are
generically greatly enhanced if the field is entangled compared to if it is
sourced instead by the energy momentum expectation value on the delocalized
state (moment variation $\sim m \, d^2$ in the latter case, with $m$ mass, $d$
separation). In addition, we obtain the (upper) limit recombination time for
graviton emission growing as $m$ in place of the naive expectation $\sqrt{m}$.
In this, the Planck mass acts as threshold mass (huge, for delocalized
objects): no graviton emission is possible below it, however fast the
recombination occurs. If this is compared with the decay times foreseen in the
collapse models of Di\'osi and Penrose (in their basic form), one finds that no
(quadrupole) graviton emission from recombination is possible in them. Indeed,
right when $m$ becomes large enough to allow for emission, it also becomes too
large for the superposition to survive collapse long enough to recombine.

  Data-Free Knowledge Distillation","Accepted to NeurIPS 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Data-free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) has attracted attention recently
thanks to its appealing capability of transferring knowledge from a teacher
network to a student network without using training data. The main idea is to
use a generator to synthesize data for training the student. As the generator
gets updated, the distribution of synthetic data will change. Such distribution
shift could be large if the generator and the student are trained
adversarially, causing the student to forget the knowledge it acquired at
previous steps. To alleviate this problem, we propose a simple yet effective
method called Momentum Adversarial Distillation (MAD) which maintains an
exponential moving average (EMA) copy of the generator and uses synthetic
samples from both the generator and the EMA generator to train the student.
Since the EMA generator can be considered as an ensemble of the generator's old
versions and often undergoes a smaller change in updates compared to the
generator, training on its synthetic samples can help the student recall the
past knowledge and prevent the student from adapting too quickly to new updates
of the generator. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets including big
datasets like ImageNet and Places365 demonstrate the superior performance of
MAD over competing methods for handling the large distribution shift problem.
Our method also compares favorably to existing DFKD methods and even achieves
state-of-the-art results in some cases.

to power grid reliability. There have been increasing interests in utilizing
financial tools, such as insurance, to help end-users hedge the potential risk
of lost load due to renewable energy variability. With insurance, a user pays a
premium fee to the utility, so that he will get compensated in case his demand
is not fully satisfied. A proper insurance design needs to resolve the
following two challenges: (i) users' reliability preference is private
information; and (ii) the insurance design is tightly coupled with the
renewable energy investment decision. To address these challenges, we adopt the
contract theory to elicit users' private reliability preferences, and we study
how the utility can jointly optimize the insurance contract and the planning of
renewable energy. A key analytical challenge is that the joint optimization of
the insurance design and the planning of renewables is non-convex. We resolve
this difficulty by revealing important structural properties of the optimal
solution, using the help of two benchmark problems: the no-insurance benchmark
and the social-optimum benchmark. Compared with the no-insurance benchmark, we
prove that the social cost and users' total energy cost are always no larger
under the optimal contract. Simulation results show that the largest benefit of
the insurance contract is achieved at a medium electricity-bill price together
with a low type heterogeneity and a high renewable uncertainty.

opportunity, when designing the future 6th generation (6G), to offer, in
addition to higher throughput, a new type of service: arbitrarily low EMFE.
Recent works have shown that a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS),
jointly optimized with the base station (BS) beamforming can improve the
received throughput at the desired location whilst reducing EMFE everywhere. In
this paper, we introduce a new concept of a non-intended user (NIU). An NIU is
a user of the network who requests low EMFE when he/she is not
downloading/uploading data. An NIU lets his/her device, called NIU equipment
(NIUE), exchange some control signaling and pilots with the network, to help
the network avoid exposing NIU to waves that are transporting data for another
user of the network: the intended user (IU), whose device is called IU
equipment (IUE). Specifically, we propose several new schemes to maximize the
IU throughput under an EMFE constraint at the NIU (in practice, an interference
constraint at the NIUE). Several propagation scenarios are investigated.
Analytical and numerical results show that proper power allocation and beam
optimization can remarkably boost the EMFE-constrained system's performance

parameters by ""reading"" a curated high-quality corpus covering a wide range of
topics. We show that WeLM is equipped with broad knowledge on various domains
and languages. On 18 monolingual (Chinese) tasks, WeLM can significantly
outperform existing pre-trained models with similar sizes and match the
performance of models up to 25 times larger. WeLM also exhibits strong
capabilities in multi-lingual and code-switching understanding, outperforming
existing multilingual language models pre-trained on 30 languages. Furthermore,
We collected human-written prompts for a large set of supervised datasets in
Chinese and fine-tuned WeLM with multi-prompted training. The resulting model
can attain strong generalization on unseen types of tasks and outperform the
unsupervised WeLM in zero-shot learning. Finally, we demonstrate that WeLM has
basic skills at explaining and calibrating the decisions from itself, which can
be promising directions for future research. Our models can be applied from

are degraded by some real-world unknown corruptions having a specific pattern
(e.g., noise, blur, etc.). To this end, we first conduct an empirical study to
validate that the model architectures can be definitely related to the
corruption patterns. Surprisingly, by just adding a few corrupted and
misclassified examples (e.g., $10^3$ examples) to the clean training dataset
(e.g., $5.0 \times 10^4$ examples), we can refine the model architecture and
enhance the robustness significantly. To make it more practical, the key
problem, i.e., how to select the proper failure examples for the effective NAS
guidance, should be carefully investigated. Then, we propose a novel
core-failure-set guided DARTS that embeds a K-center-greedy algorithm for DARTS
to select suitable corrupted failure examples to refine the model architecture.
We use our method for DARTS-refined DNNs on the clean as well as 15 corruptions

However, only transmitting task-relevant information without introducing any

variations, and the JSCC which directly maps the source data into continuous
channel input symbols poses compatibility issues on existing digital
communication systems. In this paper, we address these two issues by first
investigating the inherent tradeoff between the informativeness of the encoded

digital modulation, named discrete task-oriented JSCC (DT-JSCC), where the
transmitter encodes the features into a discrete representation and transmits
it to the receiver with the digital modulation scheme. In the DT-JSCC scheme,
we develop a robust encoding framework, named robust information bottleneck
(RIB), to improve the communication robustness to the channel variations, and
derive a tractable variational upper bound of the RIB objective function using
the variational approximation to overcome the computational intractability of
mutual information. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
DT-JSCC achieves better inference performance than the baseline methods with
low communication latency, and exhibits robustness to channel variations due to
the applied RIB framework.

observations at discrete points in space. It has been reported that for
specific regular lattices of points in dimensions 2 and 3, the usual estimate
of the surface area of the excursions remains biased even when the lattice
becomes dense in the domain of observation. In the present work, under the key
assumptions of stationarity and isotropy, we demonstrate that this limiting
bias is invariant to the locations of the observation points. Indeed, we
identify an explicit formula for the bias, showing that it only depends on the
spatial dimension $d$. This enables us to define an unbiased estimator for the
surface area of excursion sets that are approximated by general tessellations
of polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^d$, including Poisson-Voronoi tessellations. We

precision. The primary star has a mass of 1.135 +/- 0.009 Msun and a radius of
1.437 +/- 0.007 Rsun, whilst the secondary component has a mass of 0.965 +/-
0.005 Msun and a radius of 1.075 +/- 0.005 Rsun. The properties of the primary
star agree with theoretical predictions for a slightly super-solar metallicity
and an age of 5.5 Gyr. The properties of the secondary star disagree with these
and all other model predictions: whilst the luminosity is in good agreement
with models the radius is too large and the temperature is too low. These are
the defining characteristics of the radius discrepancy which has been known for
40 years but remains an active area of research. Starspot activity is evident
in the out-of-eclipse portions of the light curve, in systematic changes in the
eclipse depths, and in emission at the Ca H and K lines in a medium-resolution
spectrum of the system. Over the course of the TESS observations the light and
surface brightness ratios between the stars change linearly by 20% and 14%,

an event stream that provides better precision and much longer keypoint tracks

together.
  First, we propose a simple procedure to generate stable keypoint labels,
which we use to train a recurrent architecture. This training data results in
detections that are very consistent over time.
  Moreover, we observe that previous methods for keypoint detection work on a
representation (such as the time surface) that integrates events over a period
of time. Since this integration is required, we claim it is better to predict
the keypoints' trajectories for the time period rather than single locations,
as done in previous approaches. We predict these trajectories in the form of a
series of heatmaps for the integration time period. This improves the keypoint
localization.
  Our architecture can also be kept very simple, which results in very fast
inference times. We demonstrate our approach on the HVGA ATIS Corner dataset as
well as ""The Event-Camera Dataset and Simulator"" dataset, and show it results
in keypoint tracks that are three times longer and nearly twice as accurate as
the best previous state-of-the-art methods. We believe our approach can be

multifaceted. In regions where power prices have typically been lower than

Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) simulations we show that the

coupling the transition is of Kosterlitz-Thouless type in agreement with
bosonisation predictions. We also provide strong numerical evidences that for
large next-nearest-neighbor repulsion the transition belongs to the
Pokrovsky-Talapov univerality class describing a non-conformal
commensurate-incommensurate transition. Finally, we argue that the change of
the nature of the transition is a result of incommensurability induced by
frustration and realized even at zero doping. The implications in the context
of XXZ chain with next-nearest-neighbor Ising interaction is briefly discussed.

achieves promising results through a set of object queries and proposal boxes
updated in the cascaded training manner. However, due to the sparse nature and
the one-to-one relation between the query and its attending region, it heavily
depends on the self attention, which is usually inaccurate in the early
training stage. Moreover, in a scene of dense objects, the object query
interacts with many irrelevant ones, reducing its uniqueness and harming the
performance. This paper proposes to use IoU between different boxes as a prior
for the value routing in self attention. The original attention matrix
multiplies the same size matrix computed from the IoU of proposal boxes, and
they determine the routing scheme so that the irrelevant features can be
suppressed. Furthermore, to accurately extract features for both classification
and regression, we add two lightweight projection heads to provide the dynamic
channel masks based on object query, and they multiply with the output from
dynamic convs, making the results suitable for the two different tasks. We
validate the proposed scheme on different datasets, including MS-COCO and
CrowdHuman, showing that it significantly improves the performance and
increases the model convergence speed.

The topological transitions occur when momentum-space topological nodes, dubbed
higher-order topological charges, cross the higher-order BISs after proper
projection. Particularly, the bulk (boundary) gap closes when all (part of)
topological charges cross the BISs, characterizing the type-I (type-II) HOTPTs.
These distinct dynamical behaviours of higher-order topological charges can be
feasibly measured from quench dynamics driven with control in experiments. Our
work opens an avenue to characterize and detect the two types of HOTPTs within
a unified framework, and shall advance the research in both theory and

possible by the construction of exponentially localized and Kramers-doublet

to design off-line strategies to efficiently cover the tree with $k$ small

maximum collective time is the maximum time spent by a robot needs to finish
its assigned task (assuming that all the robots start at the same time); the
total traveled distance is the sum of the lengths of all the covering walks.

the consequences are of it being able to do so. By examining the workplace
practices of the applied machine learning researchers who produce machine
intelligence, those they work with, and the artifacts they produce. The
dissertation begins by arguing that machine intelligence proceeds from a naive
form of empiricism with ties to positivist intellectual traditions of the 17th
and 18th centuries. This naive empiricism eschews other forms of knowledge and
theory formation in order for applied machine learning researchers to enact
data performances that bring objects of analysis into existence as entities
capable of being subjected to machine intelligence. By data performances, I
mean generative enactments which bring into existence that which machine
intelligence purports to analyze or describe. The enactment of data
performances is analyzed as an agential cut into a representational field that
produces both stable claims about the world and the interpretive frame in which
those claims can hold true. The dissertation also examines how machine
intelligence depends upon a range of accommodations from other institutions and

initially proposed as a probe of delayed hadronization and two-stage quark
production in these collisions. It later emerged that general balance functions
can also serve as a probe of the diffusivity of light quarks as well as the
evolution of the systems formed in heavy-ion collisions. In this work, we
reexamine the formulation of general balance functions and consider how to best
define and measure these correlation functions in terms of differences of
conditional densities of unlike-sign and like-sign particle pairs. We define
general balance functions in terms of associated particle functions and show
these obey a simple sum rule. We additionally proceed to distinguish between
balance functions expressed as differences of conditional densities valid
irrespective of experimental acceptance boundaries and bound balance functions
that explicitly account for the limited acceptance of experiments. General
balance functions are additionally extended to accommodate strange, baryon, as
well as charm and bottom quantum numbers based on the densities of these
quantum numbers.

  Feature Pyramid Network",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the booming of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), CNNs such as VGG-16
and ResNet-50 widely serve as backbone in SAR ship detection. However, CNN
based backbone is hard to model long-range dependencies, and causes the lack of
enough high-quality semantic information in feature maps of shallow layers,
which leads to poor detection performance in complicated background and
small-sized ships cases. To address these problems, we propose a SAR ship
detection method based on Swin Transformer and Feature Enhancement Feature
Pyramid Network (FEFPN). Swin Transformer serves as backbone to model
long-range dependencies and generates hierarchical features maps. FEFPN is
proposed to further improve the quality of feature maps by gradually enhancing
the semantic information of feature maps at all levels, especially feature maps
in shallow layers. Experiments conducted on SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD)
reveal the advantage of our proposed methods.

of Fermi liquid theory and the formation of a Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid (TLL).
The strength of its many-body correlations can be quantified by a single
dimensionless parameter, the Luttinger parameter $K$, characterising the
competition between the electrons' kinetic and electrostatic energies.
Recently, signatures of a TLL have been reported for the topological edge
states of quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators, strictly 1D electronic structures
with linear (Dirac) dispersion and spin-momentum locking. Here we show that the
many-body interactions in such helical Luttinger Liquid can be effectively
controlled by the edge state's dielectric environment. This is reflected in a
tunability of the Luttinger parameter $K$, distinct on different edges of the
crystal, and extracted to high accuracy from the statistics of tunnelling
spectra at tens of tunneling points. The interplay of topology and many-body
correlations in 1D helical systems has been suggested as a potential avenue
towards realising non-Abelian parafermions.

  Diagnosis",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) has attracted appealing
attention in academic researches and clinical applications. Nevertheless, the
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) diagnosis system heavily relies on the
well-labeled lesion dataset, and the sensitivity to the variation of data
distribution also restricts the potential application of CNNs in CAD.
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods are developed to solve the
expensive annotation and domain gaps problem and have achieved remarkable
success in medical image analysis. Yet existing UDA approaches only adapt
knowledge learned from the source lesion domain to a single target lesion
domain, which is against the clinical scenario: the new unlabeled target
domains to be diagnosed always arrive in an online and continual manner.
Moreover, the performance of existing approaches degrades dramatically on
previously learned target lesion domains, due to the newly learned knowledge
overwriting the previously learned knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting).
To deal with the above issues, we develop a meta-adaptation framework named
Consecutive Lesion Knowledge Meta-Adaptation (CLKM), which mainly consists of
Semantic Adaptation Phase (SAP) and Representation Adaptation Phase (RAP) to
learn the diagnosis model in an online and continual manner. In the SAP, the
semantic knowledge learned from the source lesion domain is transferred to
consecutive target lesion domains. In the RAP, the feature-extractor is
optimized to align the transferable representation knowledge across the source
and multiple target lesion domains.

behavior of the scattering amplitude is governed by a single parameter, i.e.
the complex $s$-wave scattering length $a_c$. The many-body dynamics are thus
described by a Lindblad master equation with complex scattering length. We
solve this equation by applying the Bogoliubov approximation in analogy to the
closed systems. Various peculiar dynamical properties are discovered, some of
them may be regarded as the dissipative counterparts of the celebrated results
in closed Bose gases. For example, we show that the next-order correction to
the mean-field particle decay rate is to the order of $|n a_c^{3}|^{1/2}$,
which is an analogy of the Lee-Huang-Yang correction of Bose gases. It is also
found that there exists a dynamical symmetry of the symplectic group
Sp$(4,\mathbb{C})$ in the quadratic Bogoliubov master equation, which is an
analogy of the SU(1,1) dynamical symmetry of the corresponding closed system.
We further confirmed the validity of the Bogoliubov approximation by comparing
its results with a full numerical calculation in a double-well toy model.
Generalizations of other alternative approaches such as the dissipative version
of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and hydrodynamic theory are also discussed in

maximum-entropy data-driven spatial social networks, where each block
identifies vertices having similar position (e.g., residence) and age, and
where the expected block-to-block adjacency matrix can be inferred from the
available data. In this case, the sparse-regime approximation coincides with a
phenomenological model where the probability of a link binding two individuals
is directly proportional to their sociability and to the typical cohesion of
their age-groups, whereas it decays as an inverse-power of their geographic
distance. We support our analytical findings through simulations of a stylized

because of the scarcity of available labelled data to train the data-hungry
Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) models. The Keyword Spotting System (KWS)
provides a valid alternative to HTR due to the reduction in error rate, but it
is usually limited to a closed reference vocabulary. In this paper, we propose
a few-shot learning paradigm for spotting sequences of a few characters
(N-gram) that requires a small amount of labelled training data. We exhibit
that recognition of important n-grams could reduce the system's dependency on
vocabulary. In this case, an out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word in an input
handwritten line image could be a sequence of n-grams that belong to the
lexicon. An extensive experimental evaluation of our proposed
multi-representation approach was carried out on a subset of Bentham's
historical manuscript collections to obtain some really promising results in
this direction.

subduing the image quality. Current image restoration methods are only suitable
for small observation angle, due to their assumption of 2D spatial-invariant
degradation operation. This limits its potential for large-scale objects
imaging, like the aircraft. To ease this restriction, in this work an image
restoration method based on the 2D spatial-variant deconvolution is proposed.
First, the image degradation is seen as a complex convolution process with 2D
spatial-variant operations. Then, to restore the image, the process of
deconvolution is performed by cyclic coordinate descent algorithm. Experiments
on simulation and measured data validate the effectiveness and superiority of
the proposed method. Compared with current methods, higher precision estimation
of the targets' amplitude and position is obtained.

the efficiency of learning, a growing line of reinforcement learning research
focuses on risk functionals that depend on the entire distribution of returns.
Recent work on \emph{off-policy risk assessment} (OPRA) for contextual bandits
introduced consistent estimators for the target policy's CDF of returns along
with finite sample guarantees that extend to (and hold simultaneously over) all
risk. In this paper, we lift OPRA to Markov decision processes (MDPs), where
importance sampling (IS) CDF estimators suffer high variance on longer
trajectories due to small effective sample size. To mitigate these problems, we
incorporate model-based estimation to develop the first doubly robust (DR)
estimator for the CDF of returns in MDPs. This estimator enjoys significantly
less variance and, when the model is well specified, achieves the Cramer-Rao
variance lower bound. Moreover, for many risk functionals, the downstream
estimates enjoy both lower bias and lower variance. Additionally, we derive the
first minimax lower bounds for off-policy CDF and risk estimation, which match
our error bounds up to a constant factor. Finally, we demonstrate the precision
of our DR CDF estimates experimentally on several different environments.

condensates at higher densities, including the so-called honeycomb supersolid,
a phase that exists, as it is also the case of a triangular droplet supersolid,

honeycomb supersolids have a much-enhanced superfluid fraction while keeping a
large density contrast, and constitute in this sense a much better dipolar
supersolid. However, in contrast to droplet supersolids, quantized vortices
cannot be created in a honeycomb supersolid without driving a transition into a

in the lowest (1-27 keV) and highest (>120 keV) energy bands. Notably, the
detection of mHz QPO above 80 keV is the highest energy at which mHz QPOs have
been detected so far. The fractional rms of the mHz QPO first increases and
then decreases with energy, reaching the maximum amplitude at 50-65 keV. In
addition, at the peak of the outburst, the mHz QPO shows a double-peak

be addressed: multiple users with non-traditional input and output devices,
different hardware platforms that should be addressed, forceful interactive

this work aims to present a Software Product Line (SPL)-based approach to
support the development of Web XR apps. More specifically, we define a features
model that represents similarities and variables (domain analysis); we defined
a core composed of generic and reusable software artifacts (domain project);
and we developed an interface to support the instantiation of a Web XR app
family, named MetaSee Features Model Editor (domain implementation). This
approach integrates with a component of the MetaSEE architecture (Metaverse for
Software Engineering Education). A preliminary assessment found that Features

Web XR Apps multimodal interaction. As future work, features model and

the constitution relations receive the corrections from the cross effects

we show how to identify cross effects and new cross transport coefficients from
the second law of thermodynamics. Interestingly, the conventional transport
coefficient heat conductivity $\kappa$ is bounded from below by the product of
cross transport coefficients, which means the threshold of heat conduction is
changed. With recourse to Zubarev's non-equilibrium statistical operator, we
reproduce the construction of first-order spin hydrodynamics and identification
of cross effects in a more rigorous way. By seeking the dispersion relations of
normal modes, we find that these cross effects suppress the attenuation of
sound modes and heat mode appearing in conventional hydrodynamics and also have
impacts on the damping of non-hydrodynamic spin modes.

cognitive cost of performing tasks to predict human performance. Unfortunately,
a method for assessing mental workload that has general applicability does not
exist yet. This research presents a novel self-supervised method for mental
workload modelling from EEG data employing Deep Learning and a continuous brain
rate, an index of cognitive activation, without requiring human declarative
knowledge. This method is a convolutional recurrent neural network trainable
with spatially preserving spectral topographic head-maps from EEG data to fit
the brain rate variable. Findings demonstrate the capacity of the convolutional
layers to learn meaningful high-level representations from EEG data since
within-subject models had a test Mean Absolute Percentage Error average of 11%.
The addition of a Long-Short Term Memory layer for handling sequences of
high-level representations was not significant, although it did improve their
accuracy. Findings point to the existence of quasi-stable blocks of learnt
high-level representations of cognitive activation because they can be induced
through convolution and seem not to be dependent on each other over time,
intuitively matching the non-stationary nature of brain responses.
Across-subject models, induced with data from an increasing number of
participants, thus containing more variability, obtained a similar accuracy to
the within-subject models. This highlights the potential generalisability of
the induced high-level representations across people, suggesting the existence
of subject-independent cognitive activation patterns. This research contributes
to the body of knowledge by providing scholars with a novel computational
method for mental workload modelling that aims to be generally applicable, does
not rely on ad-hoc human-crafted models supporting replicability and
falsifiability.

energy photoelectrons in the D and E regions of the ionosphere, where they
deposit most of their ionization energy. The photoelectrons created by this
process are the main drivers for dissociation of Nitrogen molecule ($N_2$)
below 200 km. The dissociation of N2 is one of main mechanisms of the
production of Nitric Oxide (NO), an important minor constituent at these
altitudes. In order to estimate the dissociation rate of N2 we need its
dissociation cross-sections. The dissociation cross-sections for N2 by
photoelectrons are primarily estimated from the cross-sections of its
excitation states using predissociation factors and dissociative ionization
channels. The lack of cross-sections data, particularly at high electron
energies and of higher excited states of $N_2$ and $N_2^+$, introduces
uncertainty in the dissociation rate calculation, which subsequently leads to
uncertainties in the NO production rate from this source. In this work, we have
fitted updated electron impact cross-sections data and by applying
predissociation factors obtained, updated dissociation rates of N2 due to high
energy photoelectrons. The new dissociation rates of N2 are compared to the
dissociation rates obtained from Solomon and Qian [2005]. The new dissociation
cross-sections and rates are estimated to be about 30% lower than the Solomon

dependent plastic deformation behaviour controlled by individual crystal
lattice defects. Classical empirical and semi-empirical interatomic potentials
have limited capability in modelling defect properties such as the screw
dislocation core structures and Peierls barriers in the BCC structure. Machine
learning (ML) potentials, trained on DFT-based datasets, have shown some
successes in reproducing dislocation core properties. However, in group VB TMs,
the most widely-used DFT functionals produce erroneous shear moduli C44 which
are undesirably transferred to machine-learning interatomic potentials, leaving
current ML approaches unsuitable for this important class of metals and alloys.
Here, we develop two interatomic potentials for BCC vanadium (V) based on (i)
an extension of the partial electron density and screening parameter in the
classical semi-empirical modified embedded-atom method (XMEAM-V) and (ii) a
recent hybrid descriptor in the ML Deep Potential framework (DP-HYB-V). We
describe distinct features in these two disparate approaches, including their
dataset generation, training procedure, weakness and strength in modelling
lattice and defect properties in BCC V. Both XMEAM-V and DP-HYB-V reproduce a
broad range of defect properties relevant to plastic deformation and fracture.
In particular, XMEAM-V reproduces nearly all mechanical and thermodynamic
properties at DFT accuracies and with C44 near experimental value. XMEAM-V also
naturally exhibits the anomalous slip at 77 K widely observed in group VB and
VIB TMs and outperforms all existing, publically available interatomic
potentials for V. The XMEAM thus provides a practical path to developing
accurate and efficient interatomic potentials for nonmagnetic BCC TMs and

  system discovery with highly noisy data",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The identification of governing equations for dynamical systems is
everlasting challenges for the fundamental research in science and engineering.
Machine learning has exhibited great success to learn and predict dynamical
systems from data. However, the fundamental challenges still exist: discovering
the exact governing equations from highly noisy data. In present work, we
propose a compressive sensing-assisted mixed integer optimization (CS-MIO)
method to make a step forward from a modern discrete optimization lens. In
particular, we first formulate the problem into a mixed integer optimization
model. The discrete optimization nature of the model leads to exact variable
selection by means of cardinality constraint, and hereby powerful capability of
exact discovery of governing equations from noisy data. Such capability is
further enhanced by incorporating compressive sensing and regularization
techniques for highly noisy data and high-dimensional problems. The case
studies on classical dynamical systems have shown that CS-MIO can discover the
exact governing equations from large-noise data, with up to two orders of
magnitude larger noise comparing with state-of-the-art method. We also show its
effectiveness for high-dimensional dynamical system identification through the
chaotic Lorenz 96 system.

technologies has been the main driver of the digitalization of power systems.
Proper and secure monitoring of the critical grid infrastructure became an
integral part of the modern power system. Using phasor measurement units (PMUs)
to surveil the power system is one of the technologies that have a promising
future. Increased frequency of measurements and smarter methods for data
handling can improve the ability to reliably operate power grids. The increased
cyber-physical interaction offers both benefits and drawbacks, where one of the
drawbacks comes in the form of anomalies in the measurement data. The anomalies
can be caused by both physical faults on the power grid, as well as
disturbances, errors, and cyber attacks in the cyber layer. This paper aims to
develop a hybrid AI-based model that is based on various methods such as Long
Short Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and other relevant
hybrid algorithms for anomaly detection in phasor measurement unit data. The
dataset used within this research was acquired by the University of Texas,
which consists of real data from grid measurements. In addition to the real
data, false data that has been injected to produce anomalies has been analyzed.
The impacts and mitigating methods to prevent such kind of anomalies are
discussed.

  on Fair Clustering",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In the literature, several active learning techniques have been proposed for
reducing the cost of data annotation. However, it is questionable whether the
sample selection is fair with respect to sensitive attributes. Even when the
active learning model considers fairness, it comes with a cost of reduced
accuracy performance. Thus, it remains an open challenge to design an active
learning algorithm that can maintain performance as well as fairness to
underprivileged groups. This paper presents a novel active learning strategy
called Fair Active Learning using fair Clustering, Uncertainty, and
Representativeness (FAL-CUR) that provides a high accuracy while maintaining
fairness during the sample acquisition phase. We introduce the FAL-CUR sample
acquisition function that computes each sample's representative score based on
the uncertainty and similarity score for sample selection. This acquisition
function is added on top of the fair clustering method to add fairness
constraints to the active learning method. We perform extensive experiments on
four real-world datasets to compare the performance of the proposed methods.
The experimental results show that the FAL-CUR algorithm maintains the
performance accuracy while achieving high fairness measures and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on well-known fair active learning problems.

academic institutions, rapidly accelerating the adoption of online and blended
learning. This thesis explores the creation and refinement of optimized student
learning communities as a mean to support online and blended learning in the
pandemic and post-pandemic setting. Students enrolled in university courses can
be modeled as an enrollment network akin to a circuit netlist. Learning
communities are created by clustering students into groups, optimized for
maximum internal connection to support student learning, and minimum external
connection to reduce disease transmission. Three VLSI-based clustering
algorithms: Hyperedge Coarsening, Modified Hyperedge Coarsening, and Best
Choice, are modified to cluster student enrollment networks. The learning
communities created by the clustering algorithms are further refined by the
Simulated Annealing algorithm using the same optimization criteria. The
Learning Community Creation and Refinement Framework combines all three stages
of network modeling, learning community creation, and learning community
refinement. The proposed framework is tested on both the 3rd year Electrical
Engineering Fall 2020 enrollment dataset and a very large Fall 2020 and Winter
2021 enrollment dataset. Best Choice performed the best among the clustering
algorithms, capable of creating learning communities for the optimization
criteria for a given maximum cluster size. Simulated Annealing can refine the
clustering results by significantly increase cluster quality. The framework is
capable of creating and refining learning communities for both the small and
the large enrollment networks, but it is better suited for creating tailored
learning communities at a program level. Future work, including creating
student learning communities based on other optimization criteria, should be
explored.

reduced Collatz algorithm; depending on whether the root of the number is odd
or even. There is only one kind of iteration if the root is odd and two kinds
if the root is even. I also show that iterations on numbers with odd roots will
cause an increase in value and eventually lead to an even rooted number. The
iterations on even rooted numbers will subsequently cause a decrease in values.
Because increase in values during the odd root iterations are bounded, I
conclude that the Collatz iteration cannot veer to infinity. Since the sequence
generated by the Collatz iteration is infinite and the values of the numbers do
not veer to infinity it must either cycle and/or converge. I postulate that any
cycling must occur with alternating types of iterations: e.g. odd rooted
iterations which cause the values of the numbers to increase followed by even
rooted iterations which causes the values to decrease. I show here that for
simpler types of cycles, valid values of odd rooted or even rooted numbers are
only found in a narrow gap which closes as the number of iterations increase. I
further generalize to all types of odd-even and even-odd iterations. Given that
previous work has shown that only very large non-trivial cycles are feasible
during the Collatz iteration and this study shows the low probability of large
simple cycles, leads us to the conclusion most likely cycles other than the
trivial cycle are not possible during the Collatz iteration.

values across cultures when it is experienced at the sensory and perceptual
level. I argue that an approach to assessing quality of life which focuses on
an individual's ability to organize his or her context by perceiving positive
constellations of factors in the environment and his or her ability to achieve
valuable acts and realize valuable states of being is more meaningful than the
approaches of metrics which focus directly, and often solely, on the means of
living and the means of freedom. Because the felt experience of quality of life
is derived from a constellation of factors which make up the indivisible
structure of a milieu, the experience of quality of life cannot be regarded as
a subjective experience. Through the example of how different frequencies, and
mixtures of frequencies, of light are perceived as colour by the eye, I
demonstrate that the human cognitive apparatus, because of its relation to the
object that is measured, apprehends different scales of quantity as degrees of
quality. I show that lived experience is the result of a selective
relationality with one's environment and that the experience of quality has
something to do with the perception of entities in their interrelated and
networked nature as wholes.

trust building in AIRTB, namely security, robustness and fairness. For each of
these dimensions, we propose a unique taxonomy of the state of the art, trace
the root causes of possible breakdown of trust, and discuss the necessity of
the given dimension. This is followed by a comprehensive review of existing
strategies for fulfilling the requirements of each trust dimension. In
addition, we discuss the promising future directions of research essential
towards building trustworthy AIRTB systems to benefit the field of online

from, their choice of item depends not only on fixed preferences, but also on
their prior engagements with the platform. The Recommender's primary objective
is typically to encourage content consumption which optimizes some reward, such
as ad revenue, but they often also aim to ensure that a wide variety of content
is consumed by the Agent over time. We formalize this problem as an adversarial
bandit task. At each step, the Recommender presents a menu of $k$ (out of $n$)
items to the Agent, who selects one item in the menu according to their unknown
preference model, which maps their history of past items to relative selection
probabilities. The Recommender then observes the Agent's chosen item and
receives bandit feedback of the item's reward. In addition to optimizing reward
from selected items, the Recommender must also ensure that the total
distribution of chosen items has sufficiently high entropy.
  We define a class of preference models which are locally learnable, i.e.
behavior over the entire domain can be estimated by only observing behavior in
a small region; this includes models representable by bounded-degree
polynomials as well as functions with a sparse Fourier basis. For this class,
we give an algorithm for the Recommender which obtains $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$
regret against all item distributions satisfying two conditions: they are
sufficiently diversified, and they are instantaneously realizable at any
history by some distribution over menus. We show that these conditions are
closely connected: all sufficiently high-entropy distributions are
instantaneously realizable at any item history. We also give a set of negative
results justifying our assumptions, in the form of a runtime lower bound for
non-local learning and linear regret lower bounds for alternate benchmarks.
