sciences tools. The advantages stem from advanced system miniaturization, thus,
requiring far less sample volume while allowing for complex functionality,
increased reproducibility, and high throughput. However, LOC applications
necessitate extensive sensor miniaturization to leverage these inherent
advantages fully. Atom-sized quantum sensors are highly promising to bridge
this gap and have enabled measurements of temperature, electric and magnetic
fields on the nano- to microscale. Nevertheless, the technical complexity of
both disciplines has so far impeded an uncompromising combination of LOC
systems and quantum sensors. Here, we present a fully integrated microfluidic
platform for solid-state spin quantum sensors, such as the nitrogen-vacancy
(NV) center in diamond. Our platform fulfills all technical requirements, such
as fast spin manipulation, enabling full quantum sensing capabilities,
biocompatibility, and easy adaptability to arbitrary channel and chip
geometries. To illustrate the vast potential of quantum sensors in LOC systems,
we demonstrate various NV center-based sensing modalities for chemical analysis
in our microfluidic platform, ranging from paramagnetic ion detection to
high-resolution microscale NV-NMR. Consequently, our work opens the door for
novel chemical analysis capabilities within LOC devices with applications in
electrochemistry, high throughput reaction screening, bioanalytics,
organ-on-a-chip, or single-cell studies.

notice that for the increasing values of the parameters $\gamma$ and $b$ the

hand with increase in the charge $Q$ of the black hole the size of the shadow
of the black hole decreases. Further with the increase in the values of the
spin parameter $a$ of the KNKL black hole, we see that the distortion of the
shadow of the black hole becomes more prominent. Moreover we use the data
released by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration, to restrict the
parameters $b$ and $\gamma$ for the KNKL black hole, using the shadow cast by
the KNKL black hole. To this end, we also explore the relation between the
typical shadow radius and the equatorial and polar quasinormal mods (QNMs) for
the KNKL black hole and extend this correspondence to non-asymptotically flat
spacetimes. We also study the emission energy rate from the KNKL black hole for
the various spacetime parameters, and observe that it increases for the
increasing values of both the parameters $\gamma$ and $b$ for fixed
charge-to-mass and spin-to-mass ratios of the KNKL black hole. Finally, we
investigate the effects of plasma on the photon motion, size and shape of the

decentralized exchanges (DEX) for serving as counter-party to swaps is through
charging a small percentage of fees. The expected payoff from the cash flow of
this mode of market making has yet to be mathematically formulated in terms of
volatility in the existing literature. We provide here a preliminary derivation
of the payoff formula, by making the standard set of assumptions for efficient
markets, namely geometric Brownian price movements and zero arbitrage. Trading
volume, conventionally taken as an exogenous variable for fees calculation,
becomes a function of volatility and available liquidity in this formulation.
In doing so, we show that it is a near-linear function of the volatility of the

development of oncology drugs based on the ""more is better"" paradigm, developed
decades ago for chemotherapy. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) initiated Project Optimus to reform the dose optimization and dose
selection paradigm in oncology drug development. To accommodate this paradigm
shifting, we propose a dose-ranging approach to optimizing dose (DROID) for
oncology trials with targeted drugs. DROID leverages the well-established
dose-ranging study framework, which has been routinely used to develop
non-oncology drugs for decades, and bridges it with established oncology
dose-finding designs to optimize the dose of oncology drugs. DROID consists of
two seamlessly connected stages. In the first stage, patients are sequentially
enrolled and adaptively assigned to investigational doses to establish the
therapeutic dose range (TDR), defined as the range of doses with acceptable
toxicity and efficacy profiles, and the recommended phase 2 dose set (RP2S). In
the second stage, patients are randomized to the doses in RP2S to assess the
dose-response relationship and identify the optimal dose. The simulation study
shows that DROID substantially outperforms the conventional approach, providing
a new paradigm to efficiently optimize the dose of targeted oncology drugs.

scientists, with early research dating back to the 19th century. Infinitesimal
perturbations to a jet grow because of surface tension, which eventually leads
to breakup of the jet into droplets (Rayleigh-Plateau instability). Although
this classical phenomenon has long been studied, it is not clear how it is
modified when the fluid is replaced by an active fluid. In this study, we
investigate instabilities of a jet of an active fluid. The active fluid is
modelled by a suspension of microswimmers that propel themselves by generating
surface tangential velocities, i.e. squirmers. The squirmers are assumed to be
bottom-heavy and heavier than the surrounding fluid, so that a downward jet of
the active fluid self-assembles under gravity. Hydrodynamic interactions
between squirmers are computed using the Stokesian dynamics method, in which
near-field hydrodynamics are accurately calculated. We find that jets of active
fluids are unstable, with different unstable modes between pullers and pushers.
For an active fluid of pullers, the jet breaks up into droplets in a varicose
manner reminiscent of a Newtonian fluid. For pushers, on the other hand, the
jet buckles and undergoes a waving (sinuous) instability. The physical
mechanisms for these two instabilities can be understood by an inspection of
the stress fields in the jets and parametric study reveals the importance of
hydrodynamic interactions in the instabilities. Although both gravity and
bottom-heaviness play an essential role in realizing the downward jet, their
influence on the instability is found to be limited. Our findings help reveal
new features of the collective properties of active fluids.

suppliers are not equally represented in the recommendation results. This is
especially problematic when bias is amplified over time as a few items (e.g.,
popular ones) are repeatedly over-represented in recommendation lists and
users' interactions with those items will amplify bias towards those items over
time resulting in a feedback loop. This issue has been extensively studied in
the literature on model-based or neighborhood-based recommendation algorithms,
but less work has been done on online recommendation models, such as those
based on top-K contextual bandits, where recommendation models are dynamically
updated with ongoing user feedback. In this paper, we study exposure bias in a
class of well-known contextual bandit algorithms known as Linear Cascading
Bandits. We analyze these algorithms on their ability to handle exposure bias
and provide a fair representation for items in the recommendation results. Our
analysis reveals that these algorithms tend to amplify exposure disparity among
items over time. In particular, we observe that these algorithms do not
properly adapt to the feedback provided by the users and frequently recommend
certain items even when those items are not selected by users. To mitigate this
bias, we propose an Exposure-Aware (EA) reward model that updates the model
parameters based on two factors: 1) user feedback (i.e., clicked or not), and
2) position of the item in the recommendation list. This way, the proposed
model controls the utility assigned to items based on their exposure in the
recommendation list. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets using
three contextual bandit algorithms show that the proposed reward model reduces
exposure bias amplification in long run while maintaining the recommendation
accuracy.

laboratory study in an open circuit wind tunnel using overhead imagery of three

scale factors are nearly linearly proportional, thereby facilitating VA.
Importantly, the wind and vegetation scale factors were found to be

  Learning","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2012.13962",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Variational inference (VI) is a specific type of approximate Bayesian
inference that approximates an intractable posterior distribution with a
tractable one. VI casts the inference problem as an optimization problem, more
specifically, the goal is to maximize a lower bound of the logarithm of the
marginal likelihood with respect to the parameters of the approximate
posterior. Reinforcement learning (RL) on the other hand deals with autonomous
agents and how to make them act optimally such as to maximize some notion of
expected future cumulative reward. In the non-sequential setting where agents'
actions do not have an impact on future states of the environment, RL is
covered by contextual bandits and Bayesian optimization. In a proper sequential
scenario, however, where agents' actions affect future states, instantaneous
rewards need to be carefully traded off against potential long-term rewards.
This manuscript shows how the apparently different subjects of VI and RL are
linked in two fundamental ways. First, the optimization objective of RL to
maximize future cumulative rewards can be recovered via a VI objective under a
soft policy constraint in both the non-sequential and the sequential setting.
This policy constraint is not just merely artificial but has proven as a useful
regularizer in many RL tasks yielding significant improvements in agent
performance. And second, in model-based RL where agents aim to learn about the
environment they are operating in, the model-learning part can be naturally
phrased as an inference problem over the process that governs environment
dynamics. We are going to distinguish between two scenarios for the latter: VI
when environment states are fully observable by the agent and VI when they are
only partially observable through an observation distribution.

(AGN) at redshift 0.0266 classified as a Seyfert 2 nucleus in the optical, and
Compton-thick AGN in X-rays. This work exemplifies and demonstrates the MRS
capabilities to study the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectra and characterize the
physical conditions and kinematics of the ionized and molecular gas in the
nuclear regions of nearby galaxies. We obtained the nuclear, circumnuclear, and
central mid-IR spectra of NGC6552. They provide the first clear observational
evidence for a nuclear outflow in NGC6552. The outflow contributes to 67$\pm$7%
of the total line flux independent of the ionization potential (27 to 187 eV)
and critical densities (10$^4$ to 4$\times$10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$), showing an
average blue-shifted peak velocity of -127$\pm$45 kms$^{-1}$ and an outflow
maximal velocity of 698$\pm$80 kms$^{-1}$. Since the mid-IR photons penetrate
dusty regions as efficiently as X-ray keV photons, we interpret these results
as the evidence for a highly ionized, non-stratified, AGN-powered, and fast
outflowing gas in a low density environment (few 10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$) located
very close (<0.2kpc) to the Compton-thick AGN. Nine pure rotational molecular
Hydrogen lines are detected and spectrally resolved, and exhibit symmetric
Gaussian profiles, consistent with the galactic rotation, and with no evidence
of outflowing H$_{2}$ material. We detect a warm H$_{2}$ mass of
$1.9\pm1.1\times10^7 M_{\odot}$ in the central region (1.8 kpc in diameter) of
the galaxy, with almost 30% of that mass in the circum-nuclear region. Line
ratios confirm that NGC6552 has a Seyfert nucleus with a black hole mass
estimated in the range of 0.6 to 6 million solar masses.

X-ray background model consisting of the local hot bubble and the Milky Way
Halo (MWH), we include a hot collisional-ionization-equilibrium component with
a temperature of $\sim 0.8$ keV to reproduce spectra of a significant fraction
of the lines of sight. Then, the scatter in the relation between the emission
measure vs. temperature of the MWH component is reduced. Here, we exclude time
ranges with high count rates to minimize the effect of the solar wind charge
exchange (SWCX). However, the spectra of almost the same lines of sight are
inconsistent. The heliospheric SWCX emissions likely contaminate and gives a
bias in measurements of temperature and the emission measure of the MWH.
Excluding the data around the solar maximum and using the data taken before the
end of 2009, at $|b|>35^\circ$ and $105^\circ<l<255^\circ$, the temperature
(0.22 keV) and emission measure ($2\times 10^{-3}~\rm{cm^{-6}pc}$) of the MWH
are fairly uniform. The increase of the emission measure toward the lower
Galactic latitude at $|b|<35^\circ$ indicates a presence of a disk-like
morphology component. A composite model which consists of disk-like and
spherical-morphology components also reproduces the observed emission measure
distribution of MWH. In this case, the hydrostatic mass at a few tens of kpc
from the Galactic center agrees with the gravitational mass of the Milky Way.
The plasma with the virial temperature likely fills the Milky Way halo in
nearly hydrostatic equilibrium. Assuming the gas metallicity of 0.3 solar, the
upper limit of the gas mass of the spherical component out to 250 kpc, or the
virial radius, is $\sim$ a few $\times 10^{10}~ M_\odot$.

complementing this technique by performing neural upsampling of narrowband

analyze high-performing time-domain Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based

since they (1) are powerful for learning conditional distribution and (2) allow
flexible plug-in usage as a pre-processor during the training of downstream
task (ASV) with data augmentation. Prior works mainly focus on feature-domain
bandwidth extension and limited experimental setups. We address these
limitations by 1) using time-domain extension models, 2) reporting results on
three real test sets, 2) extending training data, and 3) devising new test-time
schemes. We compare supervised (conditional GAN) and unsupervised GANs
(CycleGAN) and demonstrate average relative improvement in Equal Error Rate of

spectrogram visual quality, audio perceptual quality, t-SNE embeddings, and ASV

resource contentions caused by public clouds' deep consolidation, the function
execution duration may get significantly prolonged and fail to accurately
account for the function's true resource usage. We observe that the function
duration can be highly unpredictable with huge amplification of more than 50x

scheduling policy of cloud functions' host server can have a crucial impact on
performance. The default Linux scheduler, CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler),

causing a turnaround time that is much longer than their service time.

safety of passengers and agents in their environment have risen. Each real
world traffic collision involving autonomously controlled vehicles has
compounded this concern. Open source autonomous driving implementations show a
software architecture with complex interdependent tasks, heavily reliant on
machine learning and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), which are vulnerable to non
deterministic faults and corner cases. These complex subsystems work together
to fulfill the mission of the AV while also maintaining safety. Although
significant improvements are being made towards increasing the empirical
reliability and confidence in these systems, the inherent limitations of DNN
verification create an, as yet, insurmountable challenge in providing
deterministic safety guarantees in AV.
  We propose Synergistic Redundancy (SR), a safety architecture for complex
cyber physical systems, like AV. SR provides verifiable safety guarantees
against specific faults by decoupling the mission and safety tasks of the
system. Simultaneous to independently fulfilling their primary roles, the
partially functionally redundant mission and safety tasks are able to aid each
other, synergistically improving the combined system. The synergistic safety
layer uses only verifiable and logically analyzable software to fulfill its
tasks. Close coordination with the mission layer allows easier and early
detection of safety critical faults in the system. SR simplifies the mission
layer's optimization goals and improves its design. SR provides safe deployment
of high performance, although inherently unverifiable, machine learning
software. In this work, we first present the design and features of the SR
architecture and then evaluate the efficacy of the solution, focusing on the
crucial problem of obstacle existence detection faults in AV.

techniques proposed by the research community, provably-secure logic locking
(PSLL) has acquired a foothold due to its algorithmic and provable-security
guarantees. However, the security of these techniques is questioned by
attackers that exploit the vulnerabilities arising from the hardware
implementation. Such attacks (i) are predominantly specific to locking
techniques and (ii) lack generality and scalability. This leads to a plethora
of attacks, and defenders, find it challenging to ascertain the security of
newly developed PSLL techniques. Additionally, there is no repository of locked
circuits that attackers can use to benchmark (and compare) their attacks.
  In this work, we develop a generalized attack that can recover the secret key
across different PSLL techniques. To that end, we extract functional and
structural properties depending on the hardware construction of the PSLL
techniques and develop two attacks based on the concepts of VLSI testing and
Boolean transformations. We evaluate our attacks on 30,000 locked circuits
across 14 PSLL techniques, including nine unbroken techniques. Our attacks
successfully recover the secret key (100% accuracy) for all the techniques. Our
experimentation across different (I) technology libraries, (ii) synthesis
tools, and (iii) logic optimization settings provide interesting insights. For
instance, our attacks recover the secret key by only using the locked circuit
when an academic synthesis tool is used. Additionally, designers can use our
attacks as a verification tool to ascertain the lower-bound security achieved
by hardware implementations. We shall release our artifacts, which could help
foster the development of future attacks and defenses in the PSLL domain.

is most likely due to the wider range of galaxy properties covered by our

stability model developed by Obreschkow et al. and find that, while the model
provides a very good first-order approximation for the connection between
baryonic angular momentum, mass and gas fraction, it does not fully match our

specific angular momentum on gas fraction is significantly weaker, and at fixed
gas fraction, the slope of the angular momentum vs. mass relation is shallower
than what was predicted by the model. The reasons behind this tension remain
unclear, but we speculate that multiple factors may simultaneously play a role,

in which adversaries try to exploit the (highly desirable) model reuse property
to implant Trojans into model parameters for backdoor breaches through a
poisoned training process. Most of the proposed defenses against Trojan attacks
assume a white-box setup, in which the defender either has access to the inner
state of NN or is able to run back-propagation through it. In this work, we
propose a more practical black-box defense, dubbed TrojDef, which can only run
forward-pass of the NN. TrojDef tries to identify and filter out Trojan inputs
(i.e., inputs augmented with the Trojan trigger) by monitoring the changes in
the prediction confidence when the input is repeatedly perturbed by random
noise. We derive a function based on the prediction outputs which is called the
prediction confidence bound to decide whether the input example is Trojan or
not. The intuition is that Trojan inputs are more stable as the
misclassification only depends on the trigger, while benign inputs will suffer
when augmented with noise due to the perturbation of the classification
features.
  Through mathematical analysis, we show that if the attacker is perfect in
injecting the backdoor, the Trojan infected model will be trained to learn the
appropriate prediction confidence bound, which is used to distinguish Trojan
and benign inputs under arbitrary perturbations. However, because the attacker
might not be perfect in injecting the backdoor, we introduce a nonlinear
transform to the prediction confidence bound to improve the detection accuracy
in practical settings. Extensive empirical evaluations show that TrojDef
significantly outperforms the-state-of-the-art defenses and is highly stable
under different settings, even when the classifier architecture, the training
process, or the hyper-parameters change.

with optical vortices, carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), has benefited
applications ranging from optical manipulation to high-dimensional classical
and quantum information communications. The transverse profiles of common VBs,
e.g., Laguerre-Gaussian beam and high-order Bessel beam, are hollow donuts
whose radii grow up with OAM inevitably. The inherently unperfect character of
the VBs that the radius is always positively correlated with OAM, restricts the
application of the VBs in many scenarios like fiber optic data transmission,
spatial OAM mode (de)multiplexing communication, and particle manipulation,
which call for VBs to have the same scale with distinct OAM or even the small
vortex ring for large OAM. Here, we derived a theory based on the most widely
used Laguerre-Gaussian beam to generate a brand new type of VB with
OAM-independent radii that moves away from the common unperfect constraint,
called Laguerre-Gaussian Perfect Vortex Beam (LGPVB). LGPVBs have the
self-similar property like common Laguerre-Gaussian beams but can self-heal
after suffering disturbance and always remain 'perfection' when propagating.
Our Fourier-space design not only allows us to shape the LGPVB's propagating
intensity at will, but it also gives LGPVB the fascinating potential to
arbitrarily self-accelerate while still perfectly propagating, self-similar,
and self-healing. This customizable self-healing LGPVB, whose properties inform
our most expectations of VBs, offers a better alternative for application
scenarios of common VBs in a wide range of areas.

universally observed for many types of molecular liquids that relaxation
dynamics separated into two distinct processes at low temperatures. One of the
possible interpretations is that this separation originates from the two-scale
hierarchical topography of the potential energy landscape; however, it has
never been verified. Molecular dynamics simulations are a promising approach to
tackle this issue, but we must overcome laborious difficulties. First, we must
handle a model of molecular liquids that is computationally demanding compared
to simple spherical models, which have been intensively studied but show only a
slower process: $\alpha$ relaxation. Second, we must reach a sufficiently
low-temperature regime where the two processes become well separated. Here, we
handle an asymmetric dimer system that exhibits a faster process:
Johari-Goldstein $\beta$ relaxation. Then, we employ the parallel tempering
method to access the low-temperature regime. These laborious efforts enable us
to investigate the potential energy landscape in detail and unveil the first
direct evidence of the topographic hierarchy that induces the $\beta$
relaxation. We also successfully characterize the microscopic motions of

kernels, the self-attention mechanism in Transformer can adaptively exclude the
unrelated or noisy points and thus suitable for preserving the local spatial
structure in irregular LiDAR point cloud. However, Transformer only performs a
simple sum on the point features, based on the self-attention mechanism, and
all the points share the same transformation for value. Such isotropic

primal formulations of curved thin-walled structures. We consider linear plane
curved Kirchhoff rods as a model problem to study how to remove membrane
locking from NURBS-based discretizations. In this work, we propose
continuous-assumed-strain (CAS) elements, an assumed strain treatment that
removes membrane locking from quadratic NURBS for an ample range of slenderness
ratios. CAS elements take advantage of the C1 inter-element continuity of the
displacement vector given by quadratic NURBS to interpolate the membrane strain
using linear Lagrange polynomials while preserving the C0 inter-element
continuity of the membrane strain. CAS elements are the first NURBS-based
element type able to remove membrane locking for a broad range of slenderness
ratios that combines the following characteristics: (1) No additional degrees
of freedom are added, (2) No additional systems of algebraic equations need to
be solved, and (3) The nonzero pattern of the stiffness matrix is preserved.
Since the only additional computations required by the proposed element type
are to evaluate the derivatives of the basis functions and the unit tangent
vector at the knots, the proposed scheme barely increases the computational
cost with respect to the locking-prone NURBS-based discretization of the primal
formulation. The benchmark problems show that the convergence of CAS elements
is independent of the slenderness ratio while the convergence of quadratic
NURBS elements, local Bbar elements, and local ANS elements depends heavily on
the slenderness ratio. The numerical examples also show how CAS elements remove
the spurious oscillations in stress resultants caused by membrane locking while
quadratic NURBS elements, local Bbar elements, and local ANS elements suffer
from large-amplitude spurious oscillations in stress resultants.

algorithms have achieved promising performance and attracted increasing
popularity. However, typical efforts attempt to construct a uniform enhancer
for all pixels' color transformation. It ignores the pixel differences between
different content (e.g., sky, ocean, etc.) that are significant for
photographs, causing unsatisfactory results. In this paper, we propose a novel
learnable context-aware 4-dimensional lookup table (4D LUT), which achieves
content-dependent enhancement of different contents in each image via
adaptively learning of photo context. In particular, we first introduce a
lightweight context encoder and a parameter encoder to learn a context map for
the pixel-level category and a group of image-adaptive coefficients,
respectively. Then, the context-aware 4D LUT is generated by integrating
multiple basis 4D LUTs via the coefficients. Finally, the enhanced image can be
obtained by feeding the source image and context map into fused context-aware
4D~LUT via quadrilinear interpolation. Compared with traditional 3D LUT, i.e.,
RGB mapping to RGB, which is usually used in camera imaging pipeline systems or
tools, 4D LUT, i.e., RGBC(RGB+Context) mapping to RGB, enables finer control of
color transformations for pixels with different content in each image, even
though they have the same RGB values. Experimental results demonstrate that our

diversified Data Sources) algorithm to diversify data sources in DFL.
Specifically, each vehicle maintains a state vector to record the contribution
weight of each data source to its model. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
is adopted to measure the diversity of a state vector. To boost the convergence
of DFL, a vehicle tunes the aggregation weight of each data source by
minimizing the KL divergence of its state vector, and its effectiveness in
diversifying data sources can be theoretically proved. Finally, the superiority
of DFL-DDS is evaluated by extensive experiments (with MNIST and CIFAR-10
datasets) which demonstrate that DFL-DDS can accelerate the convergence of DFL
and improve the model accuracy significantly compared with state-of-the-art
baselines.

research on audio generation, the training of a GAN model is known to be
unstable, time consuming, and data inefficient. Among the attempts to
ameliorate the training process of GANs, the idea of Projected GAN emerges as
an effective solution for GAN-based image generation, establishing the
state-of-the-art in different image applications. The core idea is to use a
pre-trained classifier to constrain the feature space of the discriminator to
stabilize and improve GAN training. This paper investigates whether Projected
GAN can similarly improve audio generation, by evaluating the performance of a
StyleGAN2-based audio-domain loop generation model with and without using a
pre-trained feature space in the discriminator. Moreover, we compare the
performance of using a general versus domain-specific classifier as the
pre-trained audio classifier. With experiments on both drum loop and synth loop
generation, we show that a general audio classifier works better, and that with
Projected GAN our loop generation models can converge around 5 times faster

assumes that we can learn a decision rule from training data drawn under the

settings, we may be concerned that our training sample is biased, and that some
groups (characterized by either observable or unobservable attributes) may be
under- or over-represented relative to the general population; and in this
setting empirical risk minimization over the training set may fail to yield
rules that perform well at deployment. We propose a model of sampling bias
called $\Gamma$-biased sampling, where observed covariates can affect the
probability of sample selection arbitrarily much but the amount of unexplained
variation in the probability of sample selection is bounded by a constant
factor. Applying the distributionally robust optimization framework, we propose
a method for learning a decision rule that minimizes the worst-case risk
incurred under a family of test distributions that can generate the training
distribution under $\Gamma$-biased sampling. We apply a result of Rockafellar

from the range effect which indicates that on the overall quality range, mean
opinion score (MOS) and predicted MOS (pMOS) are well correlated; focusing on a
particular range, the correlation is lower. The reason for the range effect is
that the predicted deviations both in a wide range and in a narrow range
destroy the uniformity between MOS and pMOS. To tackle this problem, a novel
method is proposed from coarse-grained metric to fine-grained prediction.
Firstly, we design a rank-and-gradient loss for coarse-grained metric. The loss
keeps the order and grad consistency between pMOS and MOS, thereby reducing the
predicted deviation in a wide range. Secondly, we propose multi-level tolerance
loss to make fine-grained prediction. The loss is constrained by a decreasing
threshold to limite the predicted deviation in narrower and narrower ranges.
Finally, we design a feedback network to conduct the coarse-to-fine assessment.
On the one hand, the network adopts feedback blocks to process multi-scale
distortion features iteratively and on the other hand, it fuses non-local
context feature to the output of each iteration to acquire more quality-aware
feature representation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method can alleviate the range effect compared to the state-of-the-art methods
effectively.

therefore, capturing long-range pixel correlations using CNNs is challenging,
which limits their reconstruction performance in image CS tasks. Considering
this limitation, we propose a U-shaped transformer for image CS tasks, called
the Uformer-ICS. We develop a projection-based transformer block by integrating
the prior projection knowledge of CS into the original transformer blocks, and
then build a symmetrical reconstruction model using the projection-based
transformer blocks and residual convolutional blocks. Compared with previous
CNN-based CS methods that can only exploit local image features, the proposed
reconstruction model can simultaneously utilize the local features and
long-range dependencies of an image, and the prior projection knowledge of the
CS theory. Additionally, we design an adaptive sampling model that can
adaptively sample image blocks based on block sparsity, which can ensure that
the compressed results retain the maximum possible information of the original
image under a fixed sampling ratio. The proposed Uformer-ICS is an end-to-end
framework that simultaneously learns the sampling and reconstruction processes.
Experimental results demonstrate that it achieves significantly better
reconstruction performance than existing state-of-the-art deep learning-based

speech perception is concerned. It remains a challenge how we effectively
exploit the interaction between audio and visual signals for automatic speech
recognition. There have been studies to exploit visual signals as redundant or
complementary information to audio input in a synchronous manner. Human studies
suggest that visual signal primes the listener in advance as to when and on

net), to simulate such a visual cueing mechanism for Audio-Visual Speech

surged in popularity for population inference. However, the validity of the
estimates can depend on details of the model, and there is currently little
research on validation. We explore how leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) can
be used to compare Bayesian models for MRP. We investigate two approximate
calculations of LOO, the Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS-LOO) and a
survey-weighted alternative (WTD-PSIS-LOO). Using two simulation designs, we
examine how accurately these two criteria recover the correct ordering of model
goodness at predicting population and small area level estimands. Focusing
first on variable selection, we find that neither PSIS-LOO nor WTD-PSIS-LOO
correctly recovers the models' order for an MRP population estimand (although
both criteria correctly identify the best and worst model). When considering
small-area estimation, the best model differs for different small areas,
highlighting the complexity of MRP validation. When considering different
priors, the models' order seems slightly better at smaller area levels. These
findings suggest that while not terrible, PSIS-LOO-based ranking techniques may
not be suitable to evaluate MRP as a method. We suggest this is due to the
aggregation stage of MRP, where individual-level prediction errors average out.
These results show that in practice, PSIS-LOO-based model validation tools need
to be used with caution and might not convey the full story when validating MRP
as a method.

Approaches of cloud robotics have developed from system-level to node-level.
However, the present node-level systems are not flexible enough to dynamically

evolves the present node-level systems into an algorithm-level one. ElasticROS
is based on ROS and ROS2. For fog and cloud robotics, it is the first robot
operating system with algorithm-level collaborative computing. ElasticROS
develops elastic collaborative computing to achieve adaptability to dynamic

ElasticROS. We abstract the problem and then propose an algorithm named
ElasAction to address. It is a dynamic action decision algorithm based on
online learning, which determines how robots and servers cooperate. The
algorithm dynamically updates parameters to adapt to changes of conditions
where the robot is currently in. It achieves elastically distributing of
computing tasks to robots and servers according to configurations. In addition,
we prove that the regret upper bound of the ElasAction is sublinear, which
guarantees its convergence and thus enables ElasticROS to be stable in its
elasticity. Finally, we conducted experiments with ElasticROS on common tasks
of robotics, including SLAM, grasping and human-robot dialogue, and then
measured its performances in latency, CPU usage and power consumption. The
algorithm-level ElasticROS performs significantly better than the present

permeation of water vapour was nonlinear against its pressure and 1000 stronger

their adsorption. We performed gas permeation measurements through TPT CNM at
different temperatures and found that all measured gases experienced an

method for explanation is to attribute its decision to pivotal features.
Although many algorithms are proposed, most of them solely improve the
faithfulness to the model. However, the real environment contains many random
noises, which may leads to great fluctuations in the explanations. More
seriously, recent works show that explanation algorithms are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. All of these make the explanation hard to trust in real
scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a model-agnostic method \emph{Median Test for
Feature Attribution} (MeTFA) to quantify the uncertainty and increase the
stability of explanation algorithms with theoretical guarantees. MeTFA has the
following two functions: (1) examine whether one feature is significantly
important or unimportant and generate a MeTFA-significant map to visualize the
results; (2) compute the confidence interval of a feature attribution score and
generate a MeTFA-smoothed map to increase the stability of the explanation.
Experiments show that MeTFA improves the visual quality of explanations and
significantly reduces the instability while maintaining the faithfulness. To
quantitatively evaluate the faithfulness of an explanation under different
noise settings, we further propose several robust faithfulness metrics.
Experiment results show that the MeTFA-smoothed explanation can significantly
increase the robust faithfulness. In addition, we use two scenarios to show
MeTFA's potential in the applications. First, when applied to the SOTA
explanation method to locate context bias for semantic segmentation models,
MeTFA-significant explanations use far smaller regions to maintain 99\%+
faithfulness. Second, when tested with different explanation-oriented attacks,
MeTFA can help defend vanilla, as well as adaptive, adversarial attacks against

Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and misleading coverage-signals that
misidentify ""interesting"" inputs. Towards overcoming these shortcomings, we
present ProcessorFuzz, a processor fuzzer that guides the fuzzer with a novel
CSR-transition coverage metric. ProcessorFuzz monitors the transitions in
Control and Status Registers (CSRs) as CSRs are in charge of controlling and
holding the state of the processor. Therefore, transitions in CSRs indicate a
new processor state, and guiding the fuzzer based on this feedback enables
ProcessorFuzz to explore new processor states. ProcessorFuzz is agnostic to the
HDL and does not require any instrumentation in the processor design. Thus, it
supports a wide range of RTL designs written in different hardware languages.
We evaluated ProcessorFuzz with three real-world open-source processors --

evolution sequence of the population, based on previous work by Baar and Bovier
(2018). After passing to a second `small mutations' limit, we arrive at the
canonical equation of adaptive dynamics, and state a corresponding criterion
for evolutionary branching, extending a previous result of Champagnat and
M\'el\'eard (2011).
  The criterion allows a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the effects
of dormancy in the well-known model of Dieckmann and Doebeli (1999) for
sympatric speciation. In fact, a quite intuitive picture merges: Dormancy
enlarges the parameter range for evolutionary branching, increases the carrying
capacity and niche width of the post-branching sub-populations, and, depending
on the model parameters, can either increase or decrease the `speed of
adaptation' of populations. Finally, dormancy increases diversity by increasing
the genetic distance between subpopulations.

algorithm which effectively combines the iterior point method and the

programming. Different from the standard interior point method which relies on
a costly Newton step, ABIP applies the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) to approximately solve the barrier penalized problem. In
this paper, we provide a new version of ABIP with several improvements. First,
we develop some new implementation strategies to accelerate ABIP's performance
for linear programming. Next, we extend ABIP to solving the more general linear
conic programming and establish the associated iteration complexity of the
algorithm. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments in both
synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the empirical advantage of our
developments. In particular, the enhanced ABIP achieves a 5.8x reduction in the
geometric mean of run time on $105$ LP instances from Netlib and it compares
favorably against state-of-the-art open-source solvers in a wide range of
large-scale problems. Moreover, it is even comparable to the commercial solvers

combinatorial optimization. It is defined as follows. For a given simple graph
$G=(V,E)$, a dominating set of $G$ is a subset $S\subseteq V$ such that every
vertex in $ V \setminus S$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $S$.
Furthermore, the DSP is the problem of finding a minimum-size dominating set
and the corresponding minimum size, the domination number of $G$.
  In this, work we investigate a variant of the DSP, the super dominating set
problem (SDSP), which has attracted much attention during the last years. A
dominating set $S$ is called a super dominating set of $G$, if for every vertex
$u\in \overline{S}=V \setminus S$, there exists a $v\in S$ such that $N(v)\cap
\overline{S}=\{u\}$. Analogously, the SDSP is to find a minimum-size super
dominating set, and the corresponding minimum size, the super domination number
of $G$. The decision variants of both the DSP and the SDSP have shown to be
$\mathcal{NP}$-hard.
  In this paper, we present tight bounds for the super domination number of the
neighbourhood corona product, $r$-gluing, and the Haj\'{o}s sum of two graphs.
Additionally, we present infinite families of graphs attaining our bounds.
Finally, we give the exact number of minimum size super dominating sets for
some graph classes. In particular, the number of super dominating sets for
cycles has quite surprising properties as it varies between values of the set
$\{4,n,2n,\frac{5n^2-10n}{8}\}$ based on $n\mod4$.

the local structure around the cis- and trans- conformers and the formation and

the RCL estimators i) are as consistent and doubly robust as the DML

simultaneous subarcsec optical-to-X-ray spectral energy distribution of

actual step-size within an interval. The proxy step-size exists ubiquitously
for convex and absolutely homogeneous $h(\cdot)$, and decides the actual
step-size and the tangent update in closed-form, thus the complete proximal
gradient iteration. Based on these insights, we design a Riemannian proximal
gradient method using the proxy step-size. We prove that our method converges
to a critical point, guided by a line-search technique based on the $g(\cdot)$
cost only. The proposed method can be implemented in a couple of lines of code.
We show its usefulness by applying nuclear norm, $\ell_1$ norm, and
nuclear-spectral norm regularization to three classical computer vision
problems. The improvements are consistent and backed by numerical experiments.

visual parsing of humans interacting with their environment, enabling a broad
range of applications. Prior work has demonstrated the benefits of effective
architecture design and integration of relevant cues for more accurate HOI
detection. However, the design of an appropriate pre-training strategy for this
task remains underexplored by existing approaches. To address this gap, we
propose Relational Language-Image Pre-training (RLIP), a strategy for
contrastive pre-training that leverages both entity and relation descriptions.
To make effective use of such pre-training, we make three technical
contributions: (1) a new Parallel entity detection and Sequential relation
inference (ParSe) architecture that enables the use of both entity and relation
descriptions during holistically optimized pre-training; (2) a synthetic data
generation framework, Label Sequence Extension, that expands the scale of
language data available within each minibatch; (3) mechanisms to account for
ambiguity, Relation Quality Labels and Relation Pseudo-Labels, to mitigate the
influence of ambiguous/noisy samples in the pre-training data. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of these contributions,
collectively termed RLIP-ParSe, for improved zero-shot, few-shot and
fine-tuning HOI detection performance as well as increased robustness to
learning from noisy annotations. Code will be available at

generate complex answers to biomedical questions, where the answers may contain
more than one sentence. We apply query-focused extractive summarisation
techniques. In particular, we follow a sentence classification-based approach
that scores each candidate sentence associated to a question, and the $n$
highest-scoring sentences are returned as the answer. The Synergy Task
corresponds to an end-to-end system that requires document selection, snippet
selection, and finding the final answer, but it has very limited training data.
For the Synergy task, we selected the candidate sentences following two phases:
document retrieval and snippet retrieval, and the final answer was found by
using a DistilBERT/ALBERT classifier that had been trained on the training data
of BioASQ9b. Document retrieval was achieved as a standard search over the
CORD-19 data using the search API provided by the BioASQ organisers, and
snippet retrieval was achieved by re-ranking the sentences of the top retrieved
documents, using the cosine similarity of the question and candidate sentence.
We observed that vectors represented via sBERT have an edge over tf.idf.
BioASQ10b Phase B focuses on finding the specific answers to biomedical
questions. For this task, we followed a data-centric approach. We hypothesised
that the training data of the first BioASQ years might be biased and we
experimented with different subsets of the training data. We observed an
improvement of results when the system was trained on the second half of the
BioASQ10b training data.

well such that anomalies could be detected easily once the reconstruction

  Imaging, MICCAI, 2022",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Automated anomaly detection from medical images, such as MRIs and X-rays, can
significantly reduce human effort in disease diagnosis. Owing to the complexity
of modeling anomalies and the high cost of manual annotation by domain experts
(e.g., radiologists), a typical technique in the current medical imaging
literature has focused on deriving diagnostic models from healthy subjects
only, assuming the model will detect the images from patients as outliers.
However, in many real-world scenarios, unannotated datasets with a mix of both
healthy and diseased individuals are abundant. Therefore, this paper poses the
research question of how to improve unsupervised anomaly detection by utilizing
(1) an unannotated set of mixed images, in addition to (2) the set of healthy
images as being used in the literature. To answer the question, we propose
HealthyGAN, a novel one-directional image-to-image translation method, which
learns to translate the images from the mixed dataset to only healthy images.
Being one-directional, HealthyGAN relaxes the requirement of cycle consistency
of existing unpaired image-to-image translation methods, which is unattainable
with mixed unannotated data. Once the translation is learned, we generate a
difference map for any given image by subtracting its translated output.
Regions of significant responses in the difference map correspond to potential
anomalies (if any). Our HealthyGAN outperforms the conventional
state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on two publicly available
datasets: COVID-19 and NIH ChestX-ray14, and one institutional dataset
collected from Mayo Clinic. The implementation is publicly available at

that our measure is favorable for detecting QPTs in comparison to many previous

  Organization for Migration (IOM) Migration Research Series (MRS)",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The conflict in Ukraine is causing large-scale displacement in Europe and in
the World. Based on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
estimates, more than 7 million people fled the country as of 5 September 2022.
In this context, it is extremely important to anticipate where these people are
moving so that national to local authorities can better manage challenges
related to their reception and integration. This work shows how innovative data
from social media can provide useful insights on conflict-induced migration
flows. In particular, we explore the potential of Facebook's Social
Connectedness Index (SCI) for predicting migration flows in the context of the
war in Ukraine, building on previous research findings that the presence of a
diaspora network is one of the major migration drivers. To do so, we first
evaluate the relationship between the Ukrainian diaspora and the number of
refugees from Ukraine registered for Temporary Protection or similar national
schemes as a proxy of migratory flows into the EU. We find a very strong
correlation between the two (Pearson's r=0.94, p<0.0001), which indicates that
the diaspora is attracting the people fleeing the war, who tend to reach their
compatriots, in particular in the countries where the Ukrainian immigration was
more a recent phenomenon. Second, we compare Facebook's SCI with available
official data on diaspora at regional level in Europe. Our results suggest that
the index, along with other readily available covariates, is a strong predictor
of the Ukrainian diaspora at regional scale. Finally, we discuss the potential
of Facebook's SCI to provide timely and spatially detailed information on human
diaspora for those countries where this information might be missing or
outdated, and to complement official statistics for fast policy response during
conflicts.

To this end we combine a replay of real-world trajectories and scene-dependent
abnormal driving in the simulation. In our experiments we compare 11 baselines

using standard anomaly detection metrics. The deep reconstruction and
end-to-end one-class methods show promising results. The benchmark and the

  The purpose of this paper is to explore which structures of academic articles
referees would pay more attention to, what specific content referees focus on,
and whether the distribution of PRC is related to the citations.
Design/methodology/approach
  Firstly, utilizing the feature words of section title and hierarchical
attention network model (HAN) to identify the academic article structures.
Secondly, analyzing the distribution of PRC in different structures according
to the position information extracted by rules in PRC. Thirdly, analyzing the
distribution of feature words of PRC extracted by the Chi-square test and
TF-IDF in different structures. Finally, four correlation analysis methods are
used to analyze whether the distribution of PRC in different structures is
correlated to the citations. Findings
  The count of PRC distributed in Materials and Methods and Results section is
significantly more than that in the structure of Introduction and Discussion,
indicating that referees pay more attention to the Material and Methods and
Results. The distribution of feature words of PRC in different structures is
obviously different, which can reflect the content of referees' concern. There
is no correlation between the distribution of PRC in different structures and
the citations. Research limitations/implications
  Due to the differences in the way referees write peer review reports, the
rules used to extract position information cannot cover all PRC.
Originality/value
  The paper finds a pattern in the distribution of PRC in different academic
article structures proving the long-term empirical understanding. It also
provides insight into academic article writing: researchers should ensure the
scientificity of methods and the reliability of results when writing academic
article to obtain a high degree of recognition from referees.

this paper, we introduce a novel method to analyze the convergence and

we propose to decompose the objective function of the adversary min-max game
defining a periodic GAN into its Fourier series. By studying the dynamics of
the truncated Fourier series for the continuous Alternating Gradient Descend

features of the convergence of the GAN. This approach is confirmed empirically
by studying the training flow in a $2$-parametric GAN aiming to generate an
unknown exponential distribution. As byproduct, we show that convergent orbits
in GANs are small perturbations of periodic orbits so the Nash equillibria are
spiral attractors. This theoretically justifies the slow and unstable training
observed in GANs.

evaluation approach is to assess the accuracy of a model by making use of all

having realistic expectations about their accuracy. Therefore, we propose a
principled evaluation protocol that is suitable for performing comparative

leveraging subsets of datapoints that can be selected using different criteria,
including uncertainty-related information. By making use of this new evaluation
protocol, we determined the accuracy of $564$ DNN models on both (1) the

gas-giant exoplanets, where the incoming stellar extreme ultraviolet and X-ray
fluxes are deposited. Further, for the hottest stars, the near-ultraviolet
excitation of hydrogen in the Balmer continuum may play a dominant role in
controlling the atmospheric temperature and driving photoevaporation. KELT-9 b
is the archetypal example of such an environment as it is the hottest gas-giant
exoplanet known to date (T$_{eq}$ $\sim$ 4500 K) and orbits an A0V-type star.
Studies of the upper atmosphere and escaping gas of this ultra-hot Jupiter have
targeted the absorption in the Balmer series of hydrogen (n$_1$ = 2
$\rightarrow$ n$_2$ $>$ 2). Unfortunately, the lowermost metastable helium
state that causes the triplet absorption at 108.3 nm is not sufficiently
populated for detection. Here, we present evidence of hydrogen absorption in
the Paschen series in the transmission spectrum of KELT-9 b observed with
CARMENES. Specifically, we focus on the strongest line covered by its NIR
channel, Paschen-$\beta$ at 1282.16 nm (n$_1$ = 3 $\rightarrow$ n$_2$ = 5). The
observed absorption shows a contrast of (0.53 $^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$)%, a blueshift
of $-$14.8 $^{+3.5}_{-3.2}$ km/s, and a FWHM of 31.9$^{+11.8}_{-8.3}$ km/s. The
observed blueshift in the absorption feature could be explained by day-to-night
circulation within the gravitationally bound atmosphere or, alternatively, by
Paschen-$\beta$ absorption originating in a tail of escaping gas moving toward
the observer as a result of extreme atmospheric evaporation. This detection
opens a new window for investigating the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters,
providing additional constraints of their temperature structure, mass-loss
rates, and dynamics for future modeling of their scorching atmospheres.

probability measures on families of Young diagrams subjected to a consistency

partition structures, and are motivated by a problem of population genetics.
They are related to harmonic functions and coherent systems of probability
measures on a certain branching graph. The vertices of this graph are multiple
Young diagrams (or multiple partitions), and the edges depend on the Jack
parameter. Our main result establishes a bijective correspondence between the
set of harmonic functions on the graph and probability measures on the
generalized Thoma set. The correspondence is determined by a canonical integral
representation of harmonic functions. As a consequence we obtain a
representation theorem for multiple partition structures.
  We give an example of a multiple partition structure which is expected to be
relevant for a model of population genetics for the genetic variation of a
sample of gametes from a large population. Namely, we construct a probability
measure on the wreath product of a finite group with the symmetric group. The
constructed probability measure defines a multiple partition structure which is
a generalization of the Ewens partition structure studied by Kingman. We show
that this multiple partition structure can be represented in terms of a

protecting Intellectual Property (IP) in the analog domain are mostly
overlooked. Understandably, analog components have a small footprint as most of
the surface of an Integrated Circuit (IC) is digital. Yet, since they are
challenging to design and tune, they constitute a valuable IP that ought to be
protected. This paper is the first to show a method to secure analog IP by
exploiting layout-based effects that are typically seen as undesirable
detractors in IC design. Specifically, we make use of the effects of Length of
Oxide Diffusion and Well Proximity Effect on transistors for tuning the
devices' critical parameters (e.g., gm and Vth). Such parameters are hidden
behind key inputs, akin to the logic locking approach for digital ICs. The
proposed technique is applied for locking an Operational Transconductance
Amplifier. In order to showcase the robustness of the achieved obfuscation, the
case studied circuit is simulated for a large number of key sets, i.e., >50K

(up to 130dB), phase margin (up to 50 deg), 3dB bandwidth (approx. 2.5MHz), and
power (approx. 1mW) of the locked circuit when incorrect keys are applied. Our
results show the benefit of the technique and the incurred overheads. We also
justify the non-effectiveness of reverse engineering efforts for attacking the
proposed approach. More importantly, our technique employs only regular
transistors and requires neither changes to the IC fabrication process nor any
foundry-level coordination or trust.

we add a fresh view to the vivid debate by adopting recent developments in

between an isotropic passive phase and an active nematic one. We show that

turbulence, as in active gels of uniform composition, but with exceedingly
large composition variation. In the third regime, which is uniquely associated
with inhomogeneity and occurs for large nematic tendency and low activity, we
observe spontaneous microphase separation into active and passive domains. The
microphase separated regime is notable in view of the absence of an explicit

crucial factor to improve performance in UDA, especially for tasks where there
is a large gap between source and target domains. To this end, we propose a
novel style-aware feature fusion method (SAFF) to bridge the large domain gap
and transfer knowledge while alleviating the loss of class-discriminative
information. Inspired by the human transitive inference and learning ability, a
novel style-aware self-intermediate domain (SSID) is investigated to link two
seemingly unrelated concepts through a series of intermediate auxiliary
synthesized concepts. Specifically, we propose a novel learning strategy of
SSID, which selects samples from both source and target domains as anchors, and
then randomly fuses the object and style features of these anchors to generate
labeled and style-rich intermediate auxiliary features for knowledge transfer.
Moreover, we design an external memory bank to store and update specified
labeled features to obtain stable class features and class-wise style features.
Based on the proposed memory bank, the intra- and inter-domain loss functions
are designed to improve the class recognition ability and feature
compatibility, respectively. Meanwhile, we simulate the rich latent feature
space of SSID by infinite sampling and the convergence of the loss function by
mathematical theory. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on commonly
used domain adaptive benchmarks to evaluate the proposed SAFF, and the
experimental results show that the proposed SAFF can be easily combined with
different backbone networks and obtain better performance as a plug-in-plug-out

transversely polarized state. The $\phi$ meson in a thermal equilibrium system
is preferred to occupy the state with spin $\lambda=0$ than those with spin
$\lambda=\pm1$, because the former state has smaller energy. As a consequence,
we conclude that the spin alignment will be larger than 1/3 if one measures
along the direction of the magnetic field, which is qualitatively consistent
with the recent STAR data. Around the critical temperature $T_{C}=150$ MeV, the
positive deviation from 1/3 is proportional to the square of the magnetic field
strength, which agrees with the result from the non-relativistic coalescence
model. Including the anomalous magnetic moments for quarks will modify the

Subgraph Isomorphism (SI) problem for fixed size induced patterns $H$, based on
the $k$-Clique hypothesis that the current best algorithms for Clique are
optimal.
  Our first main result is that for any pattern graph $H$ that is a {\em core},
the SI problem for $H$ is at least as hard as $t$-Clique, where $t$ is the size
of the largest clique minor of $H$. This improves (for cores) the previous
known results [Dalirrooyfard-Vassilevska W. STOC'20] that the SI for $H$ is at
least as hard as $k$-clique where $k$ is the size of the largest clique {\em
subgraph} in $H$, or the chromatic number of $H$ (under the Hadwiger
conjecture). For detecting \emph{any} graph pattern $H$, we further remove the
dependency of the result of [Dalirrooyfard-Vassilevska W. STOC'20] on the
Hadwiger conjecture at the cost of a sub-polynomial decrease in the lower
bound.
  The result for cores allows us to prove that the SI problem for induced
$k$-Path and $k$-Cycle is harder than previously known. Previously [Floderus et
al. Theor. CS 2015] had shown that $k$-Path and $k$-Cycle are at least as hard
to detect as a $\lfloor k/2\rfloor$-Clique. We show that they are in fact at
least as hard as $3k/4-O(1)$-Clique, improving the conditional lower bound
exponent by a factor of $3/2$.
  Finally, we provide a new conditional lower bound for detecting induced
$4$-cycles: $n^{2-o(1)}$ time is necessary even in graphs with $n$ nodes and
$O(n^{1.5})$ edges.

recommendations will be perfectly implemented. We propose an adherence-aware
optimization framework to capture the dichotomy between the recommended and the

is currently being done by most recommendation engines, can lead to arbitrarily
severe performance deterioration, compared with both the current human baseline
performance and what is expected by the recommendation algorithm. Our framework
also provides useful tools to analyze the structure and to compute optimal
recommendation policies that are naturally immune against such human
deviations, and are guaranteed to improve upon the baseline policy.

dust nucleation in a hostile environment. Using the grid-based
$\texttt{RAMSES}$ code, we investigate this problem by performing a 3D
hydrodynamic simulation of the inner region of the prototypical spiral nebula
around WR104. We then process the $\texttt{RAMSES}$ results using the radiative
transfer code $\texttt{RADMC3d}$ to generate a candidate observable scene. This
allows us to estimate the geometrical parameters of the shocked region. We link
those quantities to the specific chemical pathway for dust nucleation, where
the hydrogen-rich companion's wind catalyses dust formation. The scaling laws
we derive constitute a unique tool that can be directly compared to
observations. Depending on the dust nucleation locus, the velocity field
reveals a differential wind speed. Thus, the initial dust speed could be more
balanced between the speeds of the two stellar winds ($\sim$1600 km/s). With
$\texttt{RADMC3d}$, we provide constraints on the dust nucleation radius for
different combinations of dust-to-gas ratio, hydrogen enrichment and dust grain
properties. Finally, our models reveal that dust may escape beyond the
boundaries of the spiral due to hydrodynamical instabilities in the wind

We also present a numerical algorithm with mathematical and physical details

empirical parameters to fit the experimental data of NaF, NaCl, and NaBr, for
example, in pure-water solutions. It then uses another 3 parameters to predict
the activities of these salts in mixed-solvent solutions for any percentage of
methanol. Values of these parameters show mathematical or physical meaning of
ionic activities under variable mixing condition and salt concentration. The

a nanoscale information carrier and nonlinear oscillator. The present opinion
is that the formation of droplet solitons requires the compensation of magnetic
damping by a torque created by a spin-polarized electric current or pure spin
current. Here we demonstrate theoretically that nanoscale droplet solitons can
be generated and routed in ferromagnetic nanostructures with voltage-controlled
magnetic anisotropy in the presence of uncompensated magnetic damping.
Performing micromagnetic simulations for the MgO/Fe/MgO trilayer with almost
perpendicular-to-plane magnetization, we reveal the formation of the droplet
soliton under a nanoscale gate electrode subjected to a sub-nanosecond voltage
pulse. The soliton lives up to 50 ns at room temperature and can propagate over
micrometer distances in a ferromagnetic waveguide due to nonzero gradient of
the demagnetizing field. Furthermore, we show that an electrical routing of the
soliton to different outputs of a spintronic device can be realized with the
aid of an additional semiconducting nanostripe electrode creating controllable
gradient of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.

electronic states of metal tellurides (MTe) with various configurational
entropy of mixing (DSmix) at the M site. The Uiso for the M site is clearly
increased by M-site alloying with DSmix > 1.1R, which is the evidence of local
disorder introduced by the increase in DSmix via the solution of three or more
M elements. The revealed vibrational density of states (DOS) shows a remarkable
broadening with DSmix > 1.1R, which indicates glassy characteristics of atomic
vibration in HE MTe with a NaCl-type structure (low-pressure phase). On the
electronic states of the CsCl-type (high-pressure) phases, where the robustness
of Tc is observed, blurry electronic band structure appears with increasing
DSmix, which indicates the evolution of blurry (glassy) electronic states in HE
MTe with the CsCl-type structure. The estimated electronic DOS at Fermi energy
cannot explain the changes in Tc for HE MTe when assuming conventional
electron-phonon superconductivity, but the conventional explanation seems to
work for PbTe. Therefore, the pairing mechanisms in MTe with DSmix > 1.1R are
affected by glassy phonon and/or blurry electronic states in MTe, and the
robustness of superconductivity would be originating from unique
electron-phonon coupling.

addressing the challenges specific to the data domain of electron microscopy,
two different types of ensembles of pre-trained neural networks were
implemented in this work. The ensembles performed semantic segmentation of ice
crystal within a two-phase mixture, thereby tracking its phase transformation
to water. The first ensemble (EA) is composed of U-net style networks having
different underlying architectures, whereas the second series of ensembles
(ER-i) are composed of randomly initialized U-net style networks, wherein each
base learner has the same underlying architecture 'i'. The encoders of the base
learners were pre-trained on the Imagenet dataset. The performance of EA and ER
were evaluated on three different metrics: accuracy, calibration, and
uncertainty. It is seen that EA exhibits a greater classification accuracy and
is better calibrated, as compared to ER. While the uncertainty quantification
of these two types of ensembles are comparable, the uncertainty scores
exhibited by ER were found to be dependent on the specific architecture of its
base member ('i') and not consistently better than EA. Thus, the challenges
posed for the analysis of electron microscopy datasets appear to be better

fragmentation undergo significant orbital evolution. We investigate the
influence of the environment on the formation and orbital evolution of multiple
star systems, and how core fragmentation contributes to the formation of close
(20-100AU) binaries. We use multiple simulations of star formation in giant
molecular clouds and compare them to the multiplicity statistics of the Perseus
star-forming region. Simulations were run with the adaptive mesh refinement
code RAMSES with sufficient resolution to resolve core fragmentation beyond
400AU and dynamical evolution down to 16.6AU, but without the possibility of
resolving disc fragmentation. The evolution of the resulting stellar systems
was followed over millions of years. We find that star formation in lower gas
density environments is more clustered; however, despite this, the fractions of
systems that form via dynamical capture and core fragmentation are broadly
consistent at ~40\% and ~60\%, respectively. We then compared the simulation
with the conditions most similar to the Perseus star-forming region to
determine whether the observed bimodal distribution can be replicated. We find
that it can be replicated, but it is sensitive to the evolutionary state of the
simulation. Our results indicate that a significant number of low-mass close

or dynamical capture due to efficient inspiral, without the need for a further

emissions by fossil fuel combustion in the future years up to 2200 CE, by
constraining emissions to the physical limits of reserves availability. The
Meixner curve (hyperbolic secant distribution) has been used to model the
pathway of resource exploitation for the three main classes of fossil fuels,
crude oil, natural gas and coal. The kinetic model, driven by the extrapolated
emissions, has been employed to project the CO$_2$ atmospheric concentration
due to fossil fuel combustion close to the zero-reserve epoch. The result is
just the output of simple models tuned on well-known experimental data. Error
analysis of literature data provides the method robustness and the relevant
uncertainty band. Contribution of other greenhouse gases like methane and
nitrous oxide has been neglected, since their emissions cannot be projected
with the paper methodology (they do not derive from fossil reserves).
Notwithstanding this limitation, paper results clearly demonstrate that some of
the IPCC projections of the CO$_2$ concentration are largely overestimated if
compared to the physical limits of fossil fuel exploitation.

very popular and attracted the interest of many researchers. Attention-based
methods can adaptively focus attention on a small area or even single point

Furthermore, the whole feature maps will be weighted and summed by all
attention matrices during inference, causing huge redundant computations. In
this paper, we propose an efficient attention-free Single-Point Decoding
Network (dubbed SPDN) for scene text recognition, which can replace the
traditional attention-based decoding network. Specifically, we propose
Single-Point Sampling Module (SPSM) to efficiently sample one key point on the
feature map for decoding one character. In this way, our method can not only
precisely locate the key point of each character but also remove redundant

decoding network to replace the attention-based decoding network. Extensive
experiments on publicly available benchmarks verify that our SPDN can greatly
improve decoding efficiency without sacrificing performance.

monoid $S$, solutions of equations over $S$-acts, and injectivity properties of
$S$-acts. A monoid $S$ is right coherent if every finitely generated subact of
every finitely presented (right) $S$-act itself has a finite presentation.
Purity properties of an $S$-act $A$ may either be expressed in terms of
solutions in $A$ of certain consistent sets of equations over $A$, or in terms
of injectivity properties. For example, an $S$-act $A$ is absolutely pure
(almost pure) if every finite consistent set of equations over $A$ (in one
variable) has a solution in $A$. Equivalently, $A$ is absolutely pure (almost
pure) if it is injective with respect to inclusions of finitely generated
subacts into finitely presented (monogenic finitely presented) $S$-acts.
  Our first main result shows that for a right coherent monoid $S$ the classes
of almost pure and absolutely pure $S$-acts coincide. Our second main result is
that a monoid $S$ is right coherent if and only if the classes of mfp-pure and
absolutely pure $S$-acts coincide: an $S$-act is mfp-pure if it is injective
with respect to inclusions of finitely presented subacts into monogenic
finitely presented $S$-acts. We give specific examples of monoids $S$ that are

statistical quantities depend on the aging time $t_a$ for aging anomalous
diffusion processes. This paper pays more attention to how an external force
field affects the aging L\'{e}vy walk. Based on the Langevin picture of
L\'{e}vy walk and generalized Green-Kubo formula, we investigate the quantities
which include the ensemble- and time-averaged mean-squared displacements in
both weak aging $t_a\ll t$ and strong aging $t_a\gg t$ cases, and compare them
to the quantities in the absence of any force field. Two typical force fields,
constant force $F$ and time-dependent periodic force $F(t)=f_0\sin(\omega t)$,
are considered for comparison. The generalized Einstein relation is also
discussed in the case with constant force. We find that the constant force is
the key of generating the aging phenomena and enhancing the diffusion behavior
of aging L\'{e}vy walk, while the time-dependent periodic force is not. The
different effects of the two kinds of forces on the aging phenomena of L\'{e}vy

mainly based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), only local spatiality is
considered but the nonlocal relationship is ignored. Therefore, based on
semantic interaction and nonlocal topological structure, this paper proposes
the MF semantics and topology fusion network (MF-STFnet) to improve MF-PolSAR
classification performance. In MF-STFnet, two kinds of classification are
implemented for each band, semantic information-based (SIC) and topological
property-based (TPC). They work collaboratively during MF-STFnet training,
which can not only fully leverage the complementarity of bands, but also
combine local and nonlocal spatial information to improve the discrimination
between different categories. For SIC, the designed crossband interactive
feature extraction module (CIFEM) is embedded to explicitly model the deep
semantic correlation among bands, thereby leveraging the complementarity of
bands to make ground objects more separable. For TPC, the graph sample and
aggregate network (GraphSAGE) is employed to dynamically capture the
representation of nonlocal topological relations between land cover categories.
In this way, the robustness of classification can be further improved by
combining nonlocal spatial information. Finally, an adaptive weighting fusion
(AWF) strategy is proposed to merge inference from different bands, so as to
make the MF joint classification decisions of SIC and TPC. The comparative
experiments show that MF-STFnet can achieve more competitive classification
performance than some state-of-the-art methods.

background is dynamical. In this work, we apply the master-equation program to
a model that is exactly solvable, and which consists of two linearly coupled
scalar fields evolving on a cosmological background. The light field plays the
role of the system and the heavy field is the environment. By comparing the
exact solution to the output of the master equation, we can critically assess
its performance. We find that the master equation exhibits a set of ""spurious""
terms that explicitly depend on the initial conditions, and which arise as a
consequence of working on a dynamical background. Although they cancel out in
the perturbative limit of the theory (i.e. at leading orders in the interaction
strength), they spoil resummation. However, when those terms are removed, the
master equation performs impressively well to reproduce the power spectra and
the amount of the decoherence of the light field, even in the strongly
decohered regime. We conclude that master equations are able to perform
late-time resummation, even though the system is far from the Markovian limit,

polar dielectrics. This effect arises from the isotope-mass-induced line shift
of the zone-center optical phonons and is insensitive to the linewidth. We
perform numerical analyses on both the imaginary and real-frequency axes, and
derive analytical formulas for predicting the isotope effect.

design for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with vision based navigation. Time
delay is an inevitable phenomenon in cyber-physical systems, and has important
implications on controller design and trajectory generation for UAVs. The
impact of time delay on UAV dynamics increases with the use of the slower
vision based navigation stack. We show that the existing models in the
literature, which exclude time delay, are unsuitable for controller tuning
since a trivial solution for minimizing an error cost functional always exists.
The trivial solution that we identify suggests use of infinite controller gains
to achieve optimal performance, which contradicts practical findings. We avoid
such shortcomings by introducing a novel nonlinear time delay model for UAVs,
and then obtain a set of linear decoupled models corresponding to each of the
UAV control loops. The cost functional of the linearized time delay model of
angular and altitude dynamics is analyzed, and in contrast to the delay-free
models, we show the existence of finite optimal controller parameters. Due to
the use of time delay models, we experimentally show that the proposed model
accurately represents system stability limits. Due to time delay consideration,
we achieved a tracking results of RMSE 5.01 cm when tracking a lemniscate
trajectory with a peak velocity of 2.09 m/s using visual odometry (VO) based
UAV navigation, which is on par with the state-of-the-art.

task. With deep learning, the performances of face anti-spoofing (FAS) and
recaptured document detection have been improved significantly. However, the
performances are not yet satisfactory on samples with weak forensic cues. The
amount of forensic cues can be quantified to allow a reliable forensic result.
In this work, we propose a forensicability assessment network to quantify the
forensicability of the questioned samples. The low-forensicability samples are
rejected before the actual recapturing detection process to improve the
efficiency of recapturing detection systems. We first extract forensicability
features related to both image quality assessment and forensic tasks. By
exploiting domain knowledge of the forensic application in image quality and
forensic features, we define three task-specific forensicability classes and
the initialized locations in the feature space. Based on the extracted features
and the defined centers, we train the proposed forensic assessment network
(FANet) with cross-entropy loss and update the centers with a momentum-based
update method. We integrate the trained FANet with practical recapturing
detection schemes in face anti-spoofing and recaptured document detection
tasks. Experimental results show that, for a generic CNN-based FAS scheme,
FANet reduces the EERs from 33.75% to 19.23% under ROSE to IDIAP protocol by
rejecting samples with the lowest 30% forensicability scores. The performance
of FAS schemes is poor in the rejected samples, with EER as high as 56.48%.
Similar performances in rejecting low-forensicability samples have been
observed for the state-of-the-art approaches in FAS and recaptured document
detection tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
assesses the forensicability of recaptured document images and improves the

work, we consider three anomalies. Specifically, we employ a 3D CNN to separate
maxillary sinus volumes without anomalies from maxillary sinus volumes with
anomalies. To learn robust representations from a small labelled dataset, we
propose a novel learning paradigm that combines contrastive loss and
cross-entropy loss. Particularly, we use a supervised contrastive loss that
encourages embeddings of maxillary sinus volumes with and without anomaly to
form two distinct clusters while the cross-entropy loss encourages the 3D CNN
to maintain its discriminative ability. We report that optimising with both
losses is advantageous over optimising with only one loss. We also find that
our training strategy leads to label efficiency. With our method, a 3D CNN

optimal importance distribution in a general importance sampling problem as the
pushforward of a reference distribution under a composition of order-preserving
transformations, in which each transformation is formed by a squared

scalable ansatz for building order-preserving high-dimensional transformations

approximating concentrated density functions. To compute expectations over
unnormalized probability distributions, we design a ratio estimator that
estimates the normalizing constant using a separate importance distribution,
again constructed via a composition of transformations in tensor-train format.
This offers better theoretical variance reduction compared with self-normalized
importance sampling, and thus opens the door to efficient computation of rare
event probabilities in Bayesian inference problems. Numerical experiments on
problems constrained by differential equations show little to no increase in
the computational complexity with the event probability going to zero, and

enhance the communication quality between a transmitter node (TN) and receiver
node (RN), where the TN actively exploits the jamming signal as a carrier to
send messages. Specifically, the TN is equipped with a programmable-gain

high jamming-to-noise ratio (JNR) and sampling rate cases. Our analysis shows
that there exists a BER floor for sufficiently large JNR. Simulation results
indicate that the proposed AAJ scheme allows the TN to communicate with the RN

One is that the QKM with the (inner-product based) quantum kernel defined in

computational cost of the QKM increases at least quadratically with the number

provide algorithms free from both of these issues. That is, for a class of

observations about online novel recommendation for new users. First, repeat
novel consumption of new users is a common phenomenon. Second, interactions
between users and novels are informative. To accurately predict whether a user
will reconsume a novel, it is crucial to characterize each interaction at a
fine-grained level. Based on these two observations, we propose a neural
network for online novel recommendation, called NovelNet. NovelNet can
recommend the next novel from both the user's consumed novels and new novels
simultaneously. Specifically, an interaction encoder is used to obtain accurate
interaction representation considering fine-grained attributes of interaction,
and a pointer network with a pointwise loss is incorporated into NovelNet to
recommend previously-consumed novels. Moreover, an online novel recommendation
dataset is built from a well-known online novel reading platform and is
released for public use as a benchmark. Experimental results on the dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of NovelNet.

the flattening of the curve in the star formation rate - stellar mass plane,
the accretion rates begin to drop. We describe the nature of the AGN feedback
responsible for this in terms of powerful FRII jets enhancing star formation
rates but eventually also triggering a shift in accretion from near-Eddington
rates to advection dominated. These systems are on the cusp of a dramatic
transition where the active galaxy goes from strong enhancement to large
suppression of star formation in a way that produces the steeper slope for
radio AGN at low redshift compared to radio AGN at higher redshift and to
jetless AGN. We argue, therefore, that the data of Pouliasis et al constitute
the high redshift objects predicted by Singh et al (2021) that connect to the

and food demand. These increasing demands have led to fierce land-use conflicts
as we need agricultural land for food production while striving towards
renewable energy systems such as large-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) systems,
which also require in most of the cases agricultural flat land for
implementation. It is therefore essential to identify the interrelationships
between the food, and energy sectors and develop intelligent solutions to
achieve global goals such as food and energy security. A technology that has
shown promising potential in supporting food, and energy security, as well as
support water security, is agrivoltaic (AV) systems. This technology combines
conventional farm activities with PV systems on the same land. Understanding
the microclimatic conditions in an AV system is essential for an accurate
assessment of crop yield potential as well as for the energy performance of the
PV systems. Nevertheless, the complex mechanisms governing the microclimatic
conditions under agrivoltaic systems represent an underdeveloped research area.
In this study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for a vertical AV
system is developed and validated. The CFD model showed PV module temperature
estimation errors in the order of 0-2 {\deg}C and ground temperature errors in
the order of 0-1 {\deg}C. The shadings that occurred due to the vertical module
had a reduction of the solar intensity of 38%. CFD modelling can be seen as a
robust approach to analysing microclimatic parameters and assessing AV systems

samples and field-effect geometry are currently not understood. Previous
theoretical works assumed homogeneous doping of a single layer and attributed
the Tc saturation to a charge density wave instability, however the calculated

order of magnitude larger than the experimental estimates based on transport

accounting for the sample thickness, the field-effect geometry and
anharmonicity, we rule out the occurrence of charge density waves in the

explain the behaviour of Tc in different systems and geometries. From an

in-context learning, where they learn a new task from a few task

formulate an annotation-efficient, two-step framework: selective annotation
that chooses a pool of examples to annotate from unlabeled data in advance,
followed by prompt retrieval that retrieves task examples from the annotated
pool at test time. Based on this framework, we propose an unsupervised,
graph-based selective annotation method, voke-k, to select diverse,
representative examples to annotate. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets
(covering classification, commonsense reasoning, dialogue, and text/code
generation) demonstrate that our selective annotation method improves the task
performance by a large margin. On average, vote-k achieves a 12.9%/11.4%
relative gain under an annotation budget of 18/100, as compared to randomly
selecting examples to annotate. Compared to state-of-the-art supervised
finetuning approaches, it yields similar performance with 10-100x less
annotation cost across 10 tasks. We further analyze the effectiveness of our
framework in various scenarios: language models with varying sizes, alternative
selective annotation methods, and cases where there is a test data domain

Observed reflectance spectra were modelled using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
method to estimate abundances and associated uncertainties of water ices,

surface is dominated by water ice in young bright terrain (impact craters,
sulci), and low-albedo spectrally-flat material in older dark terrain (e.g.
Galileo Regio). Ice grain size has strong latitudinal and longitudinal
gradients, with larger grains at the equator and on the trailing hemisphere.
These trends are consistent with the effects of the latitudinal thermal
gradient and global variations in radiation driven sputtering. Sulphuric acid
has a low abundance and appears potentially spatially correlated with plasma
bombardment, where Ganymede's poles are exposed to the external jovian magnetic
field. Best-estimate abundances suggest a mixture of salts could be present,
although their low abundances, spectral degeneracies and associated
uncertainties mean individual salt species cannot be detected with confidence.
If present, sodium magnesium sulphate and magnesium chlorate appear tentatively
correlated with exogenic plasma bombardment, while magnesium chloride and
sulphate appear tentatively correlated with younger terrain, implying a
possible endogenic origin. MCMC modelling was also performed on Galileo/NIMS

Therefore, verifying and evaluating whether a supercomputer can achieve its

difficulty to develop a fully-supervised abnormality localization system for
CXR. In this regard, we propose to train the CXR abnormality localization
framework via a weakly semi-supervised strategy, termed Point Beyond Class
(PBC), which utilizes a small number of fully annotated CXRs with lesion-level
bounding boxes and extensive weakly annotated samples by points. Such a point
annotation setting can provide weakly instance-level information for
abnormality localization with a marginal annotation cost. Particularly, the
core idea behind our PBC is to learn a robust and accurate mapping from the
point annotations to the bounding boxes against the variance of annotated
points. To achieve that, a regularization term, namely multi-point consistency,
is proposed, which drives the model to generate the consistent bounding box
from different point annotations inside the same abnormality. Furthermore, a
self-supervision, termed symmetric consistency, is also proposed to deeply
exploit the useful information from the weakly annotated data for abnormality
localization. Experimental results on RSNA and VinDr-CXR datasets justify the
effectiveness of the proposed method. When less than 20% box-level labels are
used for training, an improvement of ~5 in mAP can be achieved by our PBC,

mechanical systems due to their powerful feature extraction and classification
capabilities. However, the CNN is a typical black-box model, and the mechanism
of CNN's decision-making are not clear, which limits its application in
high-reliability-required fault diagnosis scenarios. To tackle this issue, we
propose a novel interpretable neural network termed as Time-Frequency Network
(TFN), where the physically meaningful time-frequency transform (TFT) method is
embedded into the traditional convolutional layer as an adaptive preprocessing
layer. This preprocessing layer named as time-frequency convolutional (TFconv)
layer, is constrained by a well-designed kernel function to extract
fault-related time-frequency information. It not only improves the diagnostic
performance but also reveals the logical foundation of the CNN prediction in
the frequency domain. Different TFT methods correspond to different kernel
functions of the TFconv layer. In this study, four typical TFT methods are
considered to formulate the TFNs and their effectiveness and interpretability
are proved through three mechanical fault diagnosis experiments. Experimental
results also show that the proposed TFconv layer can be easily generalized to
other CNNs with different depths. The code of TFN is available on

One reason for this lack of use is that formal models do not match well the

investigates challenges in the adoption of requirements modeling and agile
methods in systems engineering, there is a lack of work studying successful
approaches of using requirements modelling in agile systems engineering. To
address this gap, we conducted a case study investigating the application of
requirements models at Ericsson AB, a Swedish telecommunications company. We
studied a department using requirements models to bridge agile development and
plan-driven development aspects. We find that models are used to understand how
requirements relate to each other, and to keep track with the product's
evolution. To cope with the effort to maintain models over time, study
participants suggest to rely on text-based notations that bring the models
closer to developers and allow integration into existing software development

generalizing the visual-semantic relationship learned from the seen classes. To
obtain an effective ZSL model, one may resort to curating training samples from
multiple sources, which may inevitably raise the privacy concerns about data
sharing across different organizations. In this paper, we propose a novel
Federated Zero-Shot Learning FedZSL framework, which learns a central model
from the decentralized data residing on edge devices. To better generalize to
previously unseen classes, FedZSL allows the training data on each device
sampled from the non-overlapping classes, which are far from the i.i.d. that
traditional federated learning commonly assumes. We identify two key challenges
in our FedZSL protocol: 1) the trained models are prone to be biased to the
locally observed classes, thus failing to generalize to the unseen classes
and/or seen classes appeared on other devices; 2) as each category in the
training data comes from a single source, the central model is highly
vulnerable to model replacement (backdoor) attacks. To address these issues, we
propose three local objectives for visual-semantic alignment and cross-device
alignment through relation distillation, which leverages the normalized
class-wise covariance to regularize the consistency of the prediction logits
across devices. To defend against the backdoor attacks, a feature magnitude
defending technique is proposed. As malicious samples are less correlated to
the given semantic attributes, the visual features of low magnitude will be
discarded to stabilize model updates. The effectiveness and robustness of
FedZSL are demonstrated by extensive experiments conducted on three zero-shot
benchmark datasets.

parametric form $m_{f}\sim C_f(\alpha)\Lambda_{RGI}$ and $M_W\sim g_w
c_w(\alpha)\Lambda_{RGI}$, respectively, where the coefficients $C_f(\alpha)$

these expressions, we see that to match the experimental values of the top

unobserved sector of massive fermions (that we denote Tera-fermions) subjected,

offers a promising low-power solution to the VO problem. However, conventional
algorithms for VO are not readily convertible to neuromorphic hardware. In this

neuromorphic hardware. The VO network we propose generates and stores a working

neuromorphic robotics. Moreover, our results represent an important step
towards using neuromorphic computing hardware for fast and power-efficient VO

behaviors internally using the self-model, rather than using costly physical
experimentation. Here, we quantify the benefits of such self-modeling against
the complexity of the robot. We find a R2 =0.90 correlation between the number
of degrees of freedom a robot has, and the added value of self-modeling as
compared to a direct learning baseline. This result may help motivate self
modeling in increasingly complex robotic systems, as well as shed light on the
origins of self-modeling, and ultimately self-awareness, in animals and humans.

one of the most fundamental algorithmic tasks. However, due to data
inaccuracies or modeling errors, in practical applications one often faces
linear systems that are infeasible. Extensive theoretical and practical methods
have been proposed for post-infeasibility analysis of linear systems. This
generally amounts to detecting a feasibility blocker of small size $k$, which
is a set of equations and inequalities whose removal or perturbation from the
large system of size $m$ yields a feasible system. This motivates a
parameterized approach towards post-infeasibility analysis, where we aim to
find a feasibility blocker of size at most $k$ in fixed-parameter time $f(k)
\cdot m^{O(1)}$. We establish parameterized intractability ($W[1]$- and
$NP$-hardness) results already in very restricted settings for different
choices of the parameters maximum size of a deletion set, number of
positive/negative right-hand sides, treewidth, pathwidth and treedepth.
Additionally, we rule out a polynomial compression for MinFB parameterized by
the size of a deletion set and the number of negative right-hand sides.
Furthermore, we develop fixed-parameter algorithms parameterized by various
combinations of these parameters when every row of the system corresponds to a
difference constraint. Our algorithms capture the case of Directed Feedback Arc

of paramount importance for GWDs, and this requires a complex optimization of
the coating deposition and post-deposition annealing. We present here a
systematic investigation of the optical properties and internal friction of
amorphous mixed titania-tantala coatings grown by ion beam sputtering. We
consider coatings with six different cation mixing ratios and we study them
both in the as-deposited and annealed state. By exploiting spectroscopic
ellipsometry data and modelling, along with ancillary techniques, we retrieved
the dielectric function of the coatings in a wide spectral range. When varying
the mixing ratio and performing the annealing we find monotonic trends for most
of the aforementioned properties. Remakably, the post-annealing Urbach energy
displays a definite minimum for a mixing ratio around 20%, very close to the
composition of the coatings showing the lowest optical absorption for GWDs
applications. We suggest that the observed minimum in the Urbach energy depends
not only on the mixing ratio, but also on the annealing parameters. On the
other hand, the minimum coating loss angle was found to be weakly dependent on
the considered measurement frequency and to lie within a rather broad range of
Ti content, suggesting that the search for an absolute minimum following
post-deposition annealing should be rather sought in the study of the best
annealing parameters for each specific cation ratio considered. This work
constitutes a reference for the optical properties of the amorphous mixed
titania-tantala coatings, and highlights the relevance of the Urbach energy in
the optimization process of materials for high-performing Bragg reflectors.

i-$C_{4}H_{10}$ and 0.3% $SF_{6}$. $C_{2}H_{2}F_{4}$ and $SF_{6}$ are
fluorinated greenhouse gases with a high Global Warming Potential (GWP). New
European Union regulations have imposed a progressive phase-down of the
production and usage of F-gases, aiming to cut down their emission by two
thirds in 2030 with respect to 2014. Even though research activities are
excluded from these regulations, the phase-down will inevitably increase their
price and CERN is also aiming to cut down on its emissions. For these reasons
it is crucial to find a more eco-friendly gas mixture for RPCs by the time of
the LHC long shutdown 3, foreseen in 2026. Since $C_{2}H_{2}F_{4}$ is the main
contributor to the mixture GWP, an extensive R&D process has started to replace
it with tetrafluoropropene ($C_{3}H_{2}F_{4}$), due to its chemical similarity
with $C_{2}H_{2}F_{4}$ and its low GWP (around 7). Preliminary tests with
cosmic rays have shown promising results in terms of detector performance. The
next step is to study the long-term behavior of RPCs operated with these new
gas mixtures (aging studies). Since this is a subject of interest for all (and
not only) the LHC experiments, a collaboration, ECOgas@GIF++, was setup to
carry out joint studies. Among others, a small ALICE-like RPC was installed at
the Gamma Irradiation Facility at CERN, where they are exposed to a strong
radiation field, coming from a 12.5 TBq $^{137}$Cs source, which allows one to
simulate many years of operation in a relatively short time. The facility also
provides a muon beam at specific times of the year, which can be used to study
the detector performance (e.g. efficiency and cluster size) during and after
irradiation.

absorption of multilayered graphene structure to the subnanometer interlayer
separation. Starting from a transfer-matrix formalism we derive semi-analytical

separation, results in upper bounds to the absorption of 50% for real-valued
sheet conductivities, exactly the value needed for coherent perfect absorption
(CPA), while for complex-valued conductivities we identify upper bounds that
are always lower. For pristine graphene the number of layers required to attain
this maximum is found to be fixed by the fine structure constant. For finite
interlayer separations we find that this upper bound of absorption only exists
until a particular limiting value of interlayer separation which is less than
the realistic interlayer separation in graphene multilayers. Beyond this value,
we find a strong dependence of absorption with the interlayer separation. For
an infinite number of graphene layers a closed-form analytical expression for
the absorption is derived, based on a continued-fraction analysis. Our
comparison with experiments illustrates that multilayer Van der Waals crystals
suitable for CPA can be more accurately modelled as electronically independent

obtained if their subnanometer interlayer separations are carefully accounted

switching is not very large ($<$ 5 fold), and an enhancement in the same will
highly impact such phase transition devices. One aspect that is often

induced temperature change to promote carriers over a thermionic barrier in a

a finite sum over combinatorial objects called schemes. This is a result of
combinatorial nature which remains true in the quantum mechanical setting and
in quantum field theory. Then we proceed to the double scaling limit at large

absorbent inside an imbalanced nonlinear interferometer can enhance the
precision of multiphoton cross-section estimation with respect to strategies
based on direct transmission measurements by coherent or even squeezed light.
In particular, the power scaling of the sensitivity with photon flux can be
increased by an order of magnitude compared to transmission measurements of the
sample with coherent light, meaning that a signal could be observed at
substantially reduced excitation intensities. Furthermore, we show that this
enhanced measurement precision is robust against experimental imperfections
leading to photon losses, which usually tend to degrade the detection
sensitivity. We trace the origin of this enhancement to an optimal degree of
squeezing which has to be generated in a nonlinear SU(1,1)-interferometer.

this reason many use deep ensembles of neural networks or Monte Carlo dropout

Surprisingly, when we focus on the real-world applicable constraint of $\leq

oscillators is extended by incorporating a constant time delay in the coupling.
The effects of the introduced delay on system dynamics and two-level modeling
are then investigated and found substantial. Mathematically, introducing a
delay converts the dynamical system from a finite one into an
infinite-dimensional system. The resulted system of delay differential
equations is solved using the Krylov method with Chebyshev interpolation and
post-processing refinement. The calculations and analyses reveal the critical
role that a delay can play. It has oscillatory effects as the main dynamical
eigenmodes move around a circle with a radius proportional to the coupling
strength and an angle linear with the delay. This alteration governs the energy
transfer dynamics and coherence. Accordingly, both, the delay and the coupling
strength dictate the stability of the system. The delay is the main related
parameter as for certain intervals of it, the system remains stable regardless
of the coupling. A significant effect occurs when one of the main modes crosses
the imaginary axis, where it becomes pure imaginary and dampingless. Thus, the
two states energies can live and be exchanged for an extremely long time.
Furthermore, it is found that the delay alters both the splitting and the
linewidth in a way further influencing the energy transfer and coherence. It is
found also that the delay should not be large to have significant effect. For
example, for an optical system with 500 nm wavelength, the critical delay can
be in tens of attoseconds.

revolutions every single day, and as a result of this, everything around us is
getting digitized with the touch of technology. In order to keep up the pace of
this technological revolution and help reaching this progress its zenith, one
of the most important aspects that needs to be taken care of is security. One
of the biggest boons of technology in the recent times has been the invention
of smartphones. As smartphones started becoming more popular, affordable and
easily accessible, hundreds of free messaging applications were launched, but
WhatsApp emerged as the ultimate winner in the race. This paper describes one
of the most important and popular features of WhatsApp, the End-to-End (E2E)
encryption system, which sets it apart from most other messaging applications
and is one of the reasons which helped it become so popular.

artificial intelligence (AI). The disadvantages of this type of intelligence
are discussed. As an alternative, the concept of co-evolutionary hybrid
intelligence is proposed. It is based on the cognitive interoperability of man
and machine. An analysis of existing approaches to the construction of
cognitive architectures is given. An architecture seamlessly incorporates a
human into the loop of intelligent problem solving is considered. The article
is organized as follows. The first part contains a critique of data-centric
intelligent systems. The reasons why it is impossible to create a strong
artificial intelligence based on this type of intelligence are indicated. The
second part briefly presents the concept of co-evolutionary hybrid intelligence
and shows its advantages. The third part gives an overview and analysis of
existing cognitive architectures. It is concluded that many do not consider
humans part of the intelligent data processing process. The next part discusses
the cognitive architecture for co-evolutionary hybrid intelligence, providing
integration with humans. It finishes with general conclusions about the
feasibility of developing intelligent systems with humans in the
problem-solving loop.

  (http://big-dataservice.net/)",,,,"q-bio.OT cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Colorectal cancer is the third most common tumor in men and the second in
women, accounting for 10% of all tumors worldwide. It ranks second in
cancer-related deaths with 9.4%, following lung cancer. The decrease in
mortality rate documented over the last 20 years has shown signs of slowing
down since 2017, necessitating concentrated actions on specific measures that
have exhibited considerable potential. As such, the technical foundation and
research evidence for blood-derived protein markers have been set, pending
comparative validation, clinical implementation and integration into an
artificial intelligence enabled decision support framework that also considers
knowledge on risk factors. The current paper aspires to constitute the driving
force for creating change in colorectal cancer screening by reviewing existing
medical practices through accessible and non-invasive risk estimation,
employing a straightforward artificial intelligence outlook.

  Surfaces",,,,,"eess.SP physics.class-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diffuse scattering of electromagnetic waves from natural and artificial
surfaces has been extensively studied in various disciplines, including radio
wave propagation, and several diffuse scattering models based on different
approaches have been proposed over the years, two of the most popular ones
being Kirchhoff Theory and the so-called Effective Roughness heuristic model.
The latter, although less rigorous than the former, is more flexible and
applicable to a wider range of real-world cases, including non-Gaussian
surfaces, surfaces with electrically small correlation lengths and scattering
from material inhomogeneities that are often present under the surface.
Unfortunately, the Effective Roughness model, with the exception of its
Lambertian version, does not satisfy reciprocity, which is an important
physical-soundness requirement for any propagation model. In the present work,
without compromising its effectiveness and its simple and yet sound
power-balance approach, we propose a reciprocal version of the Effective
Roughness model, which can be easily implemented and replaced to the old
version in ray-based propagation models. The new model is analyzed and compared
to the old one and to other popular models. Once properly calibrated, it is
shown to yield similar - if not better - performance with respect to the old
one when checked vs. measurements.

systems are given by the equations for signal processing. In particular, the
Brownian motion that drives the wave function of the system does not represent
noise, but provides purely the arrival of new information. Thus the wave
function is guided by the optimal signal detection about the conditions of the
environments under noisy observations. This behaviour is similar to biological
systems that detect environmental cues, process this information, and adapt to
them optimally by minimising uncertainties about the conditions of their
environments. It is postulated that information-processing capability is a
fundamental law of nature, and hence that models describing open quantum
systems can equally be applied to biological systems to model their dynamics.
For illustration, simple stochastic models are considered to capture
heliotropic and gravitropic motions of plants. The advantage of such dynamical
models is that it allows for the quantification of information processed by the
plants. By considering the consequence of information erasure, it is argued
that biological systems can process environmental signals relatively close to
the Landauer limit of computation, and that loss of information must lie at the
heart of ageing in biological systems.

in graph data learning tasks. Existing GATs generally adopt the self-attention
mechanism to conduct graph edge attention learning, requiring expensive
computation. It is known that Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can perform
inexpensive computation by transmitting the input signal data into discrete
spike trains and can also return sparse outputs. Inspired by the merits of
SNNs, in this work, we propose a novel Graph Spiking Attention Network (GSAT)
for graph data representation and learning. In contrast to self-attention
mechanism in existing GATs, the proposed GSAT adopts a SNN module architecture
which is obvious energy-efficient. Moreover, GSAT can return sparse attention
coefficients in natural and thus can perform feature aggregation on the
selective neighbors which makes GSAT perform robustly w.r.t graph edge noises.
Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, energy
efficiency and robustness of the proposed GSAT model.

  distribution","13 pages, 5 figures",,,"iit-22-09","physics.app-ph eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Copper (Cu) is the electrical conductor of choice in many categories of
electrical wiring, with household and building installations being the major
market of this metal. This work demonstrates the coating of Cu wires - with
diameters relevant for low voltage (LV) applications - with graphene. The
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) coating process is rapid, safe, scalable and
industrially compatible. Graphene-coated Cu wires display oxidation resistance
and increased electrical conductivity (up to 1% immediately after coating and
up to 3% after 24 months), allowing for wire diameter reduction and thus
significant savings in wire production costs. Combined spectroscopic and
diffraction analysis indicate that the conductivity increase is due to a change
in Cu crystallinity, induced by the coating process conditions, while
electrical testing of aged wires shows that graphene plays a major role in
maintaining improved electrical performances over long periods of time.
Finally, graphene coating of Cu wires using an ambient pressure roll-to-roll
(R2R) CVD reactor is demonstrated. This enables the in-line production of
graphene-coated metallic wires as required for industrial scale-up.
