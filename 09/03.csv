feed-forward type. A given layer $i$ with $N_{i}$ hidden units is allowed to be
normalized by $1/N_{i}^{\gamma_{i}}$ with $\gamma_{i}\in[1/2,1]$ and we study
the effect of the choice of the $\gamma_{i}$ on the statistical behavior of the
neural network's output (such as variance) as well as on the test accuracy on
the MNIST data set. We find that in terms of variance of the neural network's
output and test accuracy the best choice is to choose the $\gamma_{i}$'s to be
equal to one, which is the mean-field scaling. We also find that this is
particularly true for the outer layer, in that the neural network's behavior is
more sensitive in the scaling of the outer layer as opposed to the scaling of
the inner layers. The mechanism for the mathematical analysis is an asymptotic
expansion for the neural network's output. An important practical consequence
of the analysis is that it provides a systematic and mathematically informed
way to choose the learning rate hyperparameters. Such a choice guarantees that
the neural network behaves in a statistically robust way as the $N_i$ grow to

analysis. Fluorescent streak velocimetry (FSV) combines high-speed imaging with
highly fluorescent particles to produce images that contain fluorescent
streaks, whose length and intensity can be related to the local flow velocity.
By capturing images throughout the sample volume, the three-dimensional
velocity field can be quantified and reconstructed. We demonstrate this
technique by characterizing the channel flow profiles of several non-Newtonian
fluids: micellar Cetylpyridinium Chloride solution, Carbopol 940, and
Polyethylene Glycol. We then explore more complex flows, where significant
acceleration is created due to micro-scale features encountered within the
flow. We demonstrate the ability of FSVPy to process streaks of various shapes,
and use the variable intensity along the streak to extract position-specific
velocity measurements from individual images. Thus, we demonstrate that FSVPy
is a flexible tool that can be used to extract local velocimetry measurements

Pb$^{2+}$ $6s^2$ lone pair, and phonon softening through the mass difference
between F and Pb/X. The weak inter-layer van der Waals bonding and the strong
intra-layer ionic bonding with partial covalent bonding result in a significant
bonding heterogeneity and a poor phonon transport in the out-of-plane
direction. Large average Gr\""uneisen parameters ($\geq$ 2.5) demonstrate strong
anharmonicity. The computed phonon dispersions show flat bands, which suggest
short phonon lifetimes, especially for PbIF. Enhanced Born effective charges
are due to cross-band-gap hybridization. PbIF shows lattice instability at a
small volume expansion of 0.1$\%$. The $\kappa_l$ values obtained by the two

required for the solution of the resulting linear system of equations at each
time iteration. The presented decoupling technique separates equations for each
continuum that can be solved separately, leading to a more efficient
computational algorithm with smaller systems and faster solutions. This
approach is based on the additive representation of the operator with
semi-implicit approximation by time, where the continuum coupling part is taken
from the previous time layer. We apply, analyze and numerically investigate
decoupled schemes for classical multicontinuum problems in fractured porous
media on sufficiently fine grids with finite volume approximation. We show that
the decoupled schemes are stable, accurate, and computationally efficient.
Next, we extend and investigate this approach for multiscale approximation on
the coarse grid using the nonlocal multicontinuum (NLMC) method. In NLMC
approximation, we construct similar decoupled schemes with the same continuum
separation approach. A numerical investigation is presented for model problems

suggest that lyrics from top songs of artists people like inform their

models that generate data with a diffusion process that terminates at a random
first hitting time. This yields an extension of the standard fixed-time
diffusion models that terminate at a pre-specified deterministic time. Although
standard diffusion models are designed for continuous unconstrained data, FHDM
is naturally designed to learn distributions on continuous as well as a range
of discrete and structure domains. Moreover, FHDM enables instance-dependent
terminate time and accelerates the diffusion process to sample higher quality
data with fewer diffusion steps. Technically, we train FHDM by maximum
likelihood estimation on diffusion trajectories augmented from observed data
with conditional first hitting processes (i.e., bridge) derived based on Doob's
$h$-transform, deviating from the commonly used time-reversal mechanism. We
apply FHDM to generate data in various domains such as point cloud (general
continuous distribution), climate and geographical events on earth (continuous
distribution on the sphere), unweighted graphs (distribution of binary
matrices), and segmentation maps of 2D images (high-dimensional categorical
distribution). We observe considerable improvement compared with the
state-of-the-art approaches in both quality and speed.

$supp(Tf) \supseteq supp{f}$ for every function $f \ge 0$. We show that this
implies, under mild assumptions, that $T$ has no unimodular eigenvalues except
for possibly the number $1$. This rules out periodic behaviour of any orbits of
the powers of $T$, and thus enables us to prove convergence of those powers in
many situations.
  For the proof we first perform a careful analysis of the action of lattice
homomorphisms on the support of functions; then we split $T$ into an invertible

invertible part. An appropriate adaptation of this argument allows us to prove
another version of our main result which is useful for the study of so-called

  Model for High-Dimensional Time Series",,,,,"stat.ME stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As a special infinite-order vector autoregressive (VAR) model, the vector
autoregressive moving average (VARMA) model can capture much richer temporal
patterns than the widely used finite-order VAR model. However, its practicality
has long been hindered by its non-identifiability, computational
intractability, and relative difficulty of interpretation. This paper
introduces a novel infinite-order VAR model which, with only a little sacrifice
of generality, inherits the essential temporal patterns of the VARMA model but
avoids all of the above drawbacks. As another attractive feature, the temporal
and cross-sectional dependence structures of this model can be interpreted
separately, since they are characterized by different sets of parameters. For
high-dimensional time series, this separation motivates us to impose sparsity
on the parameters determining the cross-sectional dependence. As a result,
greater statistical efficiency and interpretability can be achieved, while no
loss of temporal information is incurred by the imposed sparsity. We introduce
an $\ell_1$-regularized estimator for the proposed model and derive the
corresponding nonasymptotic error bounds. An efficient block coordinate descent
algorithm and a consistent model order selection method are developed. The
merit of the proposed approach is supported by simulation studies and a
real-world macroeconomic data analysis.

Liked papers with no scheduling conflicts 52% more. Users also cited non-Liked

detector. Measurements of the time structure of FLASH irradiations were
performed using fast, pixelated spectral detectors, AdvaPIX-TPX3 and
Minipix-TPX3. The latter has a fraction of its sensor coated with a neutron
sensitive material. With little or no dead time and an ability to resolve
events that are closely spaced in time (tens of ns), both detectors can
accurately determine IRTs as long as pile-ups are avoided. To avoid pile-ups,
we placed the detectors beyond the Bragg peak or at a large scattering angle.
We acquired prompt gamma rays and secondary neutrons and calculated IRTs based
on timestamps of the first (beam-on) and the last (beam-off) charged species.
We also measured scan times in x, y, and diagonal directions. We performed
these measurements for a single spot, a small animal field, a patient field,
and a ridge filter optimized field to demonstrate in vivo online monitoring of
IRT. All measurements were compared to vendor log files. Differences between
measurements and log files for a single spot, a small animal field, and a
patient field were within 1%, 0.3% and 1%, respectively. In vivo monitoring of
IRTs was accurate within 0.1% for AdvaPIX-TPX3 and within 6.1% for
Minipix-TPX3. The scan times in x, y, and diagonal directions were 4.0, 3.4,
and 4.0 ms, respectively. Overall, the AdvaPIX-TPX3 can measure FLASH IRTs
within 1% accuracy, indicating that prompt gamma rays are a good surrogate for
primary protons. The Minipix-TPX3 showed a higher discrepancy, suggesting a
need for further investigation. The scan times (3.4 \pm 0.05 ms) in the 60-mm
distance of y-direction were less than (4.0 \pm 0.06 ms) in the 24-mm distance

hardware and quantum bits (qubits). Protecting data with an error-correcting
code necessitates means to recover the original data, given a potentially
corrupted data set-a task referred to as decoding. It is vital that decoding
algorithms can recover error-free states in an efficient manner. While
theoretical properties of recent QEC methods have been extensively studied,
good techniques to analyze their performance in practically more relevant
settings is still a widely unexplored area. In this work, we propose a set of

transmission dynamics, inference of important paths, and quantifying the
robustness of networks. However, the method was developed for undirected
graphs. Here we expand this methodology to weighted directed graphs and study
the redundancy and robustness found in nine networks ranging from social,
biomedical, and technical systems. We found that similarly to undirected
graphs, directed graphs in general also contain a large amount of redundancy,
as measured by the size of their (directed) distance backbone. Our methodology
adds an additional tool to the principled sparsification of complex networks
and the measure of their robustness.

exhibit, like other coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs)

manifests as markedly different community dynamics arising from saturating
functional responses with nearly identical shapes but different mathematical
expressions. Using a stochastic differential equation (SDE) version of the
Rosenzweig-MacArthur model with the three functional responses considered by
Fussman & Blasius (2005), I show that such sensitivity seems to be solely a
property of ODEs or stochastic systems with weak noise. SDEs with strong
environmental noise have by contrast very similar fluctuations patterns,
irrespective of the mathematical formula used. Although eigenvalues of
linearised predator-prey models have been used as an argument for structural
sensitivity, they can also be an argument against structural sensitivity. While
the sign of the eigenvalues' real part is sensitive to model structure, its

noise-driven oscillations for a broad range of carrying capacities. I then
discuss multiple ways to evaluate structural sensitivity in a stochastic

features of the gravitational interaction. In a strict reading, it states that
the effects of gravity can be made to disappear $locally$ by a convenient
choice of reference frame. As a consequence, no covariantly-defined
gravitational force should exist and energy-momentum of all matter and
interaction fields combined, with gravity $excluded$, should be locally
conserved. Although elegant, this separate conservation law represents a strong
constraint on the dynamics of a gravitating system and it is only logical to
question its naturality and observational basis. This is the purpose of the
present work. For concreteness sake, we analyze, in the context of metric
theories of gravity, the simplest phenomenological model which allows for local
energy-momentum exchange between the spacetime and matter/interaction fields
while preserving the seemingly more natural principle of general covariance.
This concrete model turns out to be a generalization of the socalled Rastall's
theory, with one important advantage: criticisms made to the latter, which are
often used to dismiss it as a viable or interesting model, do not apply to the
former in a universe containing ""dark"" ingredients, such as ours -- a
connection which seems to have been overlooked thus far. We conclude by
exploring the consequences of our Rastall-like model to standard (astrophysical

patients from the Osteoarthritis Initiative. To extract a region of interest

Subsequently, IW-TSE and DESS sequences were registered and the DESS
segmentations were transformed to the corresponding IW-TSE scans. The
performance of MRI-based features in the prediction of knee OA incidence was
tested using three different deep learning architectures: a residual network
(ResNet), a densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet), and a
convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE). To evaluate the predictive
performance of MRI-based features alone, the outputs of ResNet, DenseNet, and
CVAE were coupled with patient data (i.e., age, gender, BMI) and used as input

Using the first-principles calculations, we have systematically investigated
the possible O2 adsorption sites, various O2 dissociation pathways and the

more O2 physisorption sites and exhibits stronger O2 adsorption than the
pristine graphene. Among various dissociation pathways, the most preferable one
is a two-step process involving an intermediate state with the chemisorbed O2

the pristine C3N monolayer is more susceptible to oxidation than the pristine
graphene. Furthermore, we found that the most stable oxidized structure is not
produced by the most preferable dissociation pathway but generated from a
direct dissociation process. These results can be generalized into a wide range
of temperatures and pressures using ab initio atomistic thermodynamics. Our
findings deepen the understanding of the chemical stability of 2D crystalline

overlooked role of outer optimization in AT. Our exploratory evaluations reveal
that AT induces higher gradient norm and variance compared to NT. This
phenomenon hinders the outer optimization in AT since the convergence rate of
MSGD is highly dependent on the variance of the gradients. To this end, we
propose an optimization method called ENGM which regularizes the contribution

convergence rate of ENGM is independent of the variance of the gradients, and
thus, it is suitable for AT. We introduce a trick to reduce the computational

neutral particles into the pulse envelope and translate them with the group
velocity in gases. Additionally, if the trapped particles are with high
density, the probability of collision with the free atoms and molecules in air
become significant. The collision energies are in the range of 12 - 24 GeV and
high enough to ionize the neutral atoms. Thus, a new type of collision
ionization can be observed, when powerful femtosecond pulses propagate in
gaseous media.

metallic systems. We characterize the role of electronic thermal conductivity
on the velocity of recrystallization in Ni using MD coupled to a continuum
description of electronic thermal transport via a two-temperature model. Our
simulations show that for strong enough coupling between electrons and ions,
the increased thermal conductivity removes the heat from the exothermic
recrystallization process more efficiently, leading to a lower effective
temperature at the recrystallization front and, consequently, lower propagation
velocity. We characterize how electron-phonon coupling strength and system size
affects front propagation velocity. Interestingly, we find that initial
recrystallization velocity increases with decreasing in system size due to
higher overall temperatures. Overall, we show that a more accurate description
of thermal transport due to the incorporation of electrons results in better
agreement with experiments.

inference ability, but are also notorious for the incompleteness associated

KG completion has been proposed as a solution to alleviate incompleteness and
expand the coverage of KGs. It aims to make predictions for triplets involving
novel relations when only a few training triplets are provided as reference.
Previous methods have mostly focused on designing local neighbor aggregators to
learn entity-level information and/or imposing sequential dependency assumption
at the triplet level to learn meta relation information. However, valuable
pairwise triplet-level interactions and context-level relational information
have been largely overlooked for learning meta representations of few-shot
relations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical relational learning method
(HiRe) for few-shot KG completion. By jointly capturing three levels of
relational information (entity-level, triplet-level and context-level), HiRe
can effectively learn and refine the meta representation of few-shot relations,
and consequently generalize very well to new unseen relations. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets validate the superiority of HiRe against
other state-of-the-art methods.

constructing such reward functions is notoriously difficult and often a
significant engineering effort. This paper introduces a new viewpoint on the

To this end we propose a co-imitation methodology for adapting behaviour and
morphology by matching state distributions of the demonstrator. Specifically,
we focus on the challenging scenario with mismatched state- and action-spaces
between both agents. We find that co-imitation increases behaviour similarity

interpolating operator acting on the vacuum state to the target eigenstate. The
second is to instead minimize the energy expectation value of the interpolated

(1+1)-dimensions for a single-flavor massive Schwinger model to obtain
quantum-optimized interpolating operator constructions for a vector meson state

the studies of phase transitions. The Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition[2-3]
and the fractional quantum Hall effect[4], however, are believed to be induced
by another mechanism: topology change. Despite rapid development of the theory
of topological orders[5-7], a unified theoretical framework describing this new
paradigm of phase transition and its relation to the Landau paradigm, is not
seen. Here, we establish such a framework based on variational principle, and
show that the critical condition for any second-order topological phase
transitions is loss of positive-definiteness of a topologically protected
second-order variation of the free energy. A topologically protected variation
of a field solution is performed with respect to its emergent displacements,
which is introduced by constructing an emergent elasticity problem for the
solution. The Landau paradigm of phase transitions studies global property
changes induced instability, while topological phase transitions study local
property changes induced topological instability. The general effectiveness of
this criterion is shown through analyzing the topological stability of several
prototype solutions in both real space (two-kink solutions of the sine-Gordon
model; an isolated skyrmion in chiral magnets) and reciprocal space (phonon
spectrum of a monoatomic chain and a diatomic chain; band structure of a
monoatomic chain within the Kronig-Penny model). Every field is emergent
elastic with spatially modulated stiffness, and changes of topological property
occur at its softened points. We anticipate our work to be a starting point for
a general study of topological phase transitions in all field theories.

traditional process mining techniques assume events associated with exactly one
object, these techniques cannot be applied to object-centric event data. To use
traditional process mining techniques, the object-centric event data are
flattened by removing all object references but one. The flattening process is
lossy, leading to inaccurate features extracted from flattened data.
Furthermore, the graph-like structure of object-centric event data is lost when
flattening. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for extracting and
encoding features from object-centric event data. We calculate features
natively on the object-centric event data, leading to accurate measures.
Furthermore, we provide three encodings for these features: tabular,
sequential, and graph-based. While tabular and sequential encodings have been
heavily used in process mining, the graph-based encoding is a new technique
preserving the structure of the object-centric event data. We provide six use
cases: a visualization and a prediction use case for each of the three
encodings. We use explainable AI in the prediction use cases to show the
utility of both the object-centric features and the structure of the sequential

It exploits the light-travel-time effect (LTTE) to infer the presence of
additional massive bodies around a pulsating star by measuring a periodic phase
modulation of its signal. PT has been extremely successful in discovering and
characterizing stellar binaries when it was applied to high-precision light
curves over long temporal baselines, such as those delivered by the Kepler

planetary-mass regime; one such candidate has already been claimed. The advent

volumes are required which are computationally expensive. We find that the
primary source of uncertainty at these large scales is sample variance, which
decides the minimum size of simulations required to analyse current and
upcoming observations. In large-scale structure simulations, the method of
`fixing' the initial conditions (ICs) to exactly follow the initial power
spectrum and `pairing' two simulations with exactly out-of-phase ICs has been
shown to significantly reduce sample variance. Here we apply this `fixing and
pairing' (F\&P) approach to reionization simulations whose clustering signal
originates from both density fluctuations and reionization bubbles. Using a
semi-numerical code, we show that with the traditional method, simulation boxes
of $L\simeq 500$ (300) Mpc are required to model the large-scale clustering
signal at $k$=0.1 Mpc$^{-1}$ with a precision of 5 (10) per cent. Using F\&P,
the simulation boxes can be reduced by a factor of 2 to obtain the same

crack propagations in pyrophyllite and Ca-montmorillonite with water adsorption
through reactive molecular dynamics with a bond-order force field. Clay water
adsorption is considered by adding water molecules to the clay surface. During
the equilibration stage, water adsorption could cause bending deformation of
the pre-defined edge crack region. The relatively small orientating angle of
water molecules indicates the formation of hydrogen bonds in the crack
propagation process. The peak number density of adsorbed water decreases with
the increasing strains. The atomistic structure evolution of the crack tip
under loading is analyzed to interpret the nanoscale crack propagation
mechanism. The numerical results show that the crack tip first gets blunted
with a significant increase in the radius of the curvature of the crack tip and
a slight change in crack length. The crack tip blunting is studied by tracking
the crack tip opening distance and O-Si-O angle in the tetrahedral Si-O cell in
mode I and II cracks. We compare bond-breaking behaviors between Al-O and Si-O.
It is found that Si-O bond breaking is primarily responsible for crack
propagation. The critical stress intensity factor and critical energy release
rate are determined from MD simulation results.

thermodynamic properties of the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM) as traced by
rest-frame ultraviolet absorption lines around 26 galaxies at redshift
$z\lesssim1$. The study utilizes both high-quality far-ultraviolet and optical
spectra of background QSOs and deep galaxy redshift surveys to characterize the
gas density, temperature, and pressure of individual absorbing components and
to resolve their internal non-thermal motions. The derived gas density spans
more than three decades, from $\log (n_{\rm H}/{\rm cm^{-3}}) \approx -4$ to
$-1$, while the temperature of the gas is confined in a narrow range of $\log
(T/{\rm K})\approx 4.3\pm 0.3$. In addition, a weak anti-correlation between
gas density and temperature is observed, consistent with the expectation of the
gas being in photoionization equilibrium. Furthermore, decomposing the observed
line widths into thermal and non-thermal contributions reveals that more than
30% of the components at $z\lesssim 1$ exhibit line widths driven by
non-thermal motions, in comparison to $<20$% found at $z\approx 2$-3.
Attributing the observed non-thermal line widths to intra-clump turbulence, we
find that massive quenched galaxies on average exhibit higher non-thermal
broadening/turbulent energy in their CGM compared to star-forming galaxies at
$z\lesssim 1$. Finally, strong absorption features from multiple ions covering
a wide range of ionization energy (e.g., from Mg II to O IV) can be present
simultaneously in a single absorption system with kinematically aligned
component structure, but the inferred pressure in different phases may differ
by a factor of $\approx 10$.

FuzzerAid that uses fault signatures to group crashes reported by the fuzzers.
Fault signature is a small executable program and consists of a selection of
necessary statements from the original program that can reproduce a bug. In our
approach, we first generate a fault signature using a given crash. We then
execute the fault signature with other crash inducing inputs. If the failure is
reproduced, we classify the crashes into the group labeled with the fault

inducing inputs are classified, we further merge the fault signatures of the

the frequency of the Minnaert resonance. The collective interactions between
bubbles in a small ensemble are primarily in the same phase, causing them to
radiate a spherically-symmetric field that peaks at a frequency lower than the
Minnaert resonance for a single bubble. In contrast, large periodic arrays
include bubbles that are further apart than half the wavelength, so that
collective resonances have bubbles oscillating in opposite phases, ultimately
creating a fundamental resonance at a frequency higher than the single-bubble
Minnaert resonance. This work investigates the transition in resonance behavior
using a modal analysis of a mass-spring system and a boundary element method.
We significantly reduce the computational complexity of the full-wave solver to
a linear dependence on the number of bubbles in a rectangular array. The
simulated acoustic fields confirm the initial downshift in resonance frequency
and the strong influence of collective resonances when the array has hundreds
of bubbles covering more than half the wavelength. These results are essential
in understanding the low-frequency resonance characteristics of bubble
ensembles, which have important applications in diverse fields such as

two successive mergers of massive galaxies each with stellar mass M* > 3e11
Msun that also produces a bright, rare triple quasar system powered by three
~10^9 Msun black holes. The second merger of supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
follows the first after 150 Myrs. The merger events lead to sustained Eddington
accretion onto the central SMBH, forming an UMBH in the center of a massive
compact stellar core with M* > 2e12 Msun. The strong feedback of the UMBH
quenches the surrounding star formation to < 10 Msun/yr in the inner 50 kpc/h

are also produced by major mergers of galaxies, and their progenitors can be

their phase and group velocities as well as the sign of the latter. The salient
features of splashes are controlled by the existence of extremal values of the
phase and the group velocities: the group velocity gives the expansion rate of
the locus of the points where new wavefronts nucleate or existing ones
disappear, while the phase velocity determines the large-time expansion rate of
a group of wavefronts. If the group velocity is negative in a spectral range
and takes on a minimal value within it, then converging wavefronts will be
present in the splash. These results are relevant to the studies of several

to a small pebble or a raindrop, a splash in the two-dimensional electron gas
caused by a short voltage pulse applied with the tip of a scanning tunneling
microscope, or a bulk splash in superfluid $^{4}He$ due to formation of an

two-dimensional vertical container, motivated by the following question: how to
get the most out of a given external vibration to maximize internal disorder
(e.g. to blend particles) and agitation (e.g. to absorb vibrations)? Granular
media are analogs to classical thermodynamic systems, where the injection of
energy can be achieved by shaking them: fluidization arises by tuning either
the amplitude or the frequency of the oscillations. Alternatively, we explore
what happens when another feature, the container geometry, is modified while
keeping constant the energy injection. Our method consists in modifying the
container base into a V-shape to break the symmetries of the inner particulate
arrangement. The lattice contains a compact hexagonal solid-like crystalline
phase coexisting with a loose amorphous fluid-like phase, at any thermal
agitation. We show that both the solid-to-fluid volume fraction and the
granular temperature depend not only on the external vibration but also on the
number of topological defects triggered by the asymmetry of the container. The
former relies on the statistics of the energy fluctuations and the latter is
consistent with a two-dimensional melting transition described by the KTHNY
theory.

represent the fundamental elements of any machine learning setup. But
researchers have also employed more complex factors to estimate the test error
and generalization performance with high predictability. These factors are
generally specific to the domain or application. For example, feature diversity
was primarily used for promoting syn-to-real transfer by Chen et al. (2021).
With numerous scaling factors defined in previous works, it would be
interesting to investigate how these factors may affect overall generalization
performance in the context of self-supervised learning with CNN models. How do
individual factors promote generalization, which includes varying depth, width,
or the number of training epochs with early stopping? For example, does higher
feature diversity result in higher accuracy held in complex settings other than
a syn-to-real transfer? How do these factors depend on each other? We found
that the last layer is the most diversified throughout the training. However,
while the model's test error decreases with increasing epochs, its diversity
drops. We also discovered that diversity is directly related to model width.

likelihood-based methodologies have been used in Bayesian modeling of many

combine the flexibility of a non-parametric distribution estimator together
with the interpretability of a parametric model. The model is specified by
estimating equations-based constraints. Drawing an inference from a Bayesian
empirical likelihood (BayesEL) posterior is challenging. The likelihood is
computed numerically, so no closed expression of the posterior exists.
Moreover, for any sample of finite size, the support of the likelihood is
non-convex, which hinders the fast mixing of many Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) procedures. It has been recently shown that using the properties of the
gradient of log empirical likelihood, one can devise an efficient Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm to sample from a BayesEL posterior.
  The package requires the user to specify only the estimating equations, the
prior, and their respective gradients. An MCMC sample drawn from the BayesEL
posterior of the parameters, with various details required by the user is
obtained.

design stages where fixes are costly, it is crucial to identify security
concerns as early as possible, such as in RTL designs. In this work, we
investigate the practical implications and feasibility of producing a set of
security-specific scanners that operate on Verilog source files. The scanners
indicate parts of code that might contain one of a set of MITRE's common
weakness enumerations (CWEs). We explore the CWE database to characterize the
scope and attributes of the CWEs and identify those that are amenable to static
analysis. We prototype scanners and evaluate them on 11 open source designs - 4
system-on-chips (SoC) and 7 processor cores - and explore the nature of
identified weaknesses. Our analysis reported 53 potential weaknesses in the
OpenPiton SoC used in Hack@DAC-21, 11 of which we confirmed as security

  CCS'22",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Models can expose sensitive information about their training data. In an
attribute inference attack, an adversary has partial knowledge of some training
records and access to a model trained on those records, and infers the unknown
values of a sensitive feature of those records. We study a fine-grained variant
of attribute inference we call \emph{sensitive value inference}, where the
adversary's goal is to identify with high confidence some records from a
candidate set where the unknown attribute has a particular sensitive value. We
explicitly compare attribute inference with data imputation that captures the
training distribution statistics, under various assumptions about the training
data available to the adversary. Our main conclusions are: (1) previous
attribute inference methods do not reveal more about the training data from the
model than can be inferred by an adversary without access to the trained model,
but with the same knowledge of the underlying distribution as needed to train
the attribute inference attack; (2) black-box attribute inference attacks
rarely learn anything that cannot be learned without the model; but (3)
white-box attacks, which we introduce and evaluate in the paper, can reliably
identify some records with the sensitive value attribute that would not be
predicted without having access to the model. Furthermore, we show that
proposed defenses such as differentially private training and removing
vulnerable records from training do not mitigate this privacy risk. The code

astrophysical domains. Unfortunately, the observed spectra are contaminated by
the Earth's atmosphere. While different techniques exist to correct for
telluric lines in exoplanet atmospheric studies, in radial velocity (RV)
studies, telluric lines with an absorption depth of >2% are generally masked,
which poses a problem for faint targets and M dwarfs as most of their RV
content is present where telluric contamination is important. We propose a
simple telluric model to be embedded in the ESPRESSO DRS. The goal is to
provide telluric-free spectra and enable RV measurements, including spectral
ranges where telluric lines fall. The model is a line-by-line radiative
transfer code that assumes a single atmospheric layer. We use the sky
conditions and the physical properties of the lines from HITRAN to create the
telluric spectrum. A subset of selected telluric lines is used to robustly fit
the spectrum through a Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm. When applied
to stellar spectra from A0- to M5-type stars, the residuals of the strongest
H2O lines are below 2% for all spectral types, with the exception of M dwarfs,
which are within the pseudo-continuum. We then determined the RVs from the
telluric-corrected ESPRESSO spectra of Tau Ceti and Proxima. We created
telluric-free masks and compared the obtained RVs with the DRS RVs. In the case
of Tau Ceti, we identified that micro-telluric lines introduce systematics up
to an amplitude of 58 cm/s and with a period of one year. For Proxima, the gain
in spectral content at redder wavelengths is equivalent to a gain of 25% in
photon noise. This leads to better constraints on the semi-amplitude and
eccentricity of Proxima d. We showcase that our model can be applied to other
molecules, and thus to other wavelength regions observed by other
spectrographs, such as NIRPS.

complete-case analysis may lead to bias, under-coverage, inflated type I error,

proposed and compared for individually randomized trials with missing effect

intracluster correlations in the effect modifiers, outcomes, or even
missingness mechanisms may introduce further threats to accurate assessment of
HTE. In this paper, the performance of various commonly-used missing data

The superconductivity found here in the non-equilibrium steady state is due to
the $\eta $-pairing mechanism, characterized by the existence of the
off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO), and is absent in the ground-state phase
diagram. The key of the scheme lies in the generation of the field-induced
charge density wave (CDW) state that is from the valence bond solid. The
dynamics of this state resides in the highly-excited subspace of dimerized
Hubbard model and is dominated by a $\eta $-spin ferromagnetic model. The decay
of such long-living excitation is suppressed because of energy conservation. We
also develop a dynamical method to detect the ODLRO of the non-equilibrium
steady state. Our finding demonstrates that the non-equilibrium many-body
dynamics induced by the interplay between the resonant external field and
electron-electron interaction is an alternative pathway to access a new exotic
quantum state, and also provides an alternative mechanism for enhancing

from binary black-hole (BBH) and binary neutron-star (BNS) coalescences in a

Einstein Telescope) and determine how well they can be measured; this then
limits how well we can observe other subdominant astrophysical and cosmological

corresponding SGWBs, which consist of a superposition of (i) undetected
signals, and (ii) the residual background from imperfect removal of resolved
sources. The sum of the two components sets the sensitivity for observing other
SGWBs. Our results show that, even with next-generation observatories, the
residual background is large and limits the sensitivity to other SGWBs. The
main contributions to the residual background arise from uncertainties in
inferring the coalescence phase and luminosity distance of the detected
signals. Alternative approaches to signal subtraction would need to be explored
to minimize the BBH and BNS foreground in order to observe SGWBs from other

Self-knowledge distillation, the special case of knowledge distillation, has
been proposed to remove the large teacher network training process while

Self-knowledge distillation approach via Siamese representation learning, which
minimizes the difference between two representation vectors of the two
different views from a given sample. Our proposed method, SKD-SRL, utilizes
both soft label distillation and the similarity of representation vectors.
Therefore, SKD-SRL can generate more consistent predictions and representations
in various views of the same data point. Our benchmark has been evaluated on
various standard datasets. The experimental results have shown that SKD-SRL
significantly improves the accuracy compared to existing supervised learning

and negative instances to contrast a given anchor image in multi-label
scenario, let the label missing one alone, implying that borrowing a
commonly-used way from contrastive multi-class learning to define them will
incur a lot of false negative instances unfavorable for learning. In this
paper, with the introduction of a label correction mechanism to identify
missing labels, we first elegantly generate positives and negatives for
individual semantic labels of an anchor image, then define a unique contrastive
loss for multi-label image classification with missing labels (CLML), the loss
is able to accurately bring images close to their true positive images and
false negative images, far away from their true negative images. Different from
existing multi-label CL losses, CLML also preserves low-rank global and local
label dependencies in the latent representation space where such dependencies
have been shown to be helpful in dealing with missing labels. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first general multi-label CL loss in the
missing-label scenario and thus can seamlessly be paired with those losses of
any existing multi-label learning methods just via a single hyperparameter. The
proposed strategy has been shown to improve the classification performance of
the Resnet101 model by margins of 1.2%, 1.6%, and 1.3% respectively on three

of the Electronic Health Records (EHR) of patients. However, most models

distribution shifts, diminishing the generalization ability of deep learning
models to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. In this setting, spurious statistical
correlations that may change in different environments will be exploited, which
can cause sub-optimal performances of deep learning models. The unstable
correlation between procedures and diagnoses existed in the training
distribution can cause spurious correlation between historical EHR and future
diagnosis. To address this problem, we propose to use a causal representation
learning method called Causal Healthcare Embedding (CHE). CHE aims at
eliminating the spurious statistical relationship by removing the dependencies
between diagnoses and procedures. We introduce the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence
Criterion (HSIC) to measure the degree of independence between the embedded
diagnosis and procedure features. Based on causal view analyses, we perform the
sample weighting technique to get rid of such spurious relationship for the
stable learning of EHR across different environments. Moreover, our proposed
CHE method can be used as a flexible plug-and-play module that can enhance
existing deep learning models on EHR. Extensive experiments on two public
datasets and five state-of-the-art baselines unequivocally show that CHE can
improve the prediction accuracy of deep learning models on out-of-distribution
data by a large margin. In addition, the interpretability study shows that CHE
could successfully leverage causal structures to reflect a more reasonable

Specifically, LR image patches are taken from a patient as inputs, while the
most similar HR patches from other patients are found as labels. The similarity
between the matched HR and LR patches serves as a prior for network
construction. Our proposed method can be implemented by designing a new network

consisting of corresponding paired cover/stego-images. However, it is
inefficient and impractical for those steganalysis tools to completely retrain
the CNN model to make it effective against both the existing steganographic
algorithms and a new emerging steganographic algorithm. Thus, existing
steganalysis models usually lack dynamic extensibility for new steganographic
algorithms, which limits their application in real-world scenarios. To address
this issue, we propose an accurate parameter importance estimation (APIE)
based-continual learning scheme for steganalysis. In this scheme, when a
steganalysis model is trained on the new image dataset generated by the new
steganographic algorithm, its network parameters are effectively and
efficiently updated with sufficient consideration of their importance evaluated
in the previous training process. This approach can guide the steganalysis
model to learn the patterns of the new steganographic algorithm without
significantly degrading the detectability against the previous steganographic
algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed scheme has promising
extensibility for new emerging steganographic algorithms.

could simultaneously reduce the coupling among peer networks and the error
accumulation between teacher and student networks. In addition, we propose two
complementary contrastive learning modules. The high-level module can transfer
high-quality knowledge from labeled data to unlabeled ones and promote
separation between classes in feature space. The low-level module can encourage
low-quality features learning from the high-quality features among peer

performance of traditional student-teacher approaches, and our framework
outperforms stateof-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. Our source code of

guarantees strong privacy by providing plausible deniability of sensitive data.
Existing works on this issue mostly focused on discovering heavy hitters,
leaving the task of frequent itemset mining (FIM) as an open problem. To the
best of our knowledge, the-state-of-the-art LDP solution to FIM is the SVSM
protocol proposed recently. The SVSM protocol is mainly based on the padding

an independent item without considering the frequency consistency among
itemsets.
  In this paper, we propose a novel LDP approach to FIM called LDP-FPMiner
based on frequent pattern tree (FP-tree). Our proposal exploits frequency
consistency among itemsets by constructing and optimizing a noisy FP-tree with
LDP. Specifically, it works as follows. First, the most frequent items are
identified, and the item domain is cut down accordingly. Second, the maximum
level of the FP-tree is estimated. Third, a noisy FP-tree is constructed and
optimized by using itemset frequency consistency, and then mined to obtain the
k most frequent itemsets. Experimental results show that the LDP-FPMiner
significantly improves over the state-of-the-art approach, SVSM, especially in
the case of a high privacy level.

matter, the so-called anybody localization, emerges across the whole spectrum.
This transition is energy dependent, a phenomenon known as mobility edge, such
that the mid-spectrum eigenstates tend to localize at larger values of disorder
in comparison to eigenstates near the edges of the spectrum. Many-body
localization becomes more sophisticated in long-range interacting systems.
Here, by focusing on several quantities, we draw the phase diagram as a
function of disorder strength and energy spectrum, for a various range of

or Kosterlitz-Thouless, our analysis consistently determines the mobility edge,
i.e. the phase boundary across the spectrum. We show that long-range
interaction enhances the localization effect and shifts the phase boundary
towards smaller values of disorder. In addition, we establish a hierarchy among
the studied quantities concerning their corresponding transition boundary and
critical exponents. Interestingly, we show that deliberately discarding some

household appliances are the primary energy consumers, their recognition
becomes crucial to avoid unattended usage, thereby conserving energy and making
smart environments more sustainable. An appliance recognition model is
traditionally trained at a central server (service provider) by collecting
electricity consumption data, recorded via smart plugs, from the clients
(consumers), causing a privacy breach. Besides that, the data are susceptible
to noisy labels that may appear when an appliance gets connected to a
non-designated smart plug. While addressing these issues jointly, we propose a
novel federated learning approach to appliance recognition, called FedAR+,
enabling decentralized model training across clients in a privacy preserving
way even with mislabeled training data. FedAR+ introduces an adaptive noise
handling method, essentially a joint loss function incorporating weights and
label distribution, to empower the appliance recognition model against noisy
labels. By deploying smart plugs in an apartment complex, we collect a labeled
dataset that, along with two existing datasets, are utilized to evaluate the
performance of FedAR+. Experimental results show that our approach can
effectively handle up to $30\%$ concentration of noisy labels while
outperforming the prior solutions by a large margin on accuracy.

coarse-to-fine generation process. We thereby propose a novel Dynamical
Semantic Evolution GAN (DSE-GAN) to re-compose each stage's text features under
a novel single adversarial multi-stage architecture. Specifically, we design
(1) Dynamic Semantic Evolution (DSE) module, which first aggregates historical
image features to summarize the generative feedback, and then dynamically
selects words required to be re-composed at each stage as well as re-composed
them by dynamically enhancing or suppressing different granularity subspace's
semantics. (2) Single Adversarial Multi-stage Architecture (SAMA), which
extends the previous structure by eliminating complicated multiple adversarial

contrastive learning-based methods fail to ensure that the positive (or
negative) sequence obtained by some random augmentation (or sequence sampling)
on a given anchor user sequence remains to be semantically similar (or
different). When the positive and negative sequences turn out to be false
positive and false negative respectively, it may lead to degraded
recommendation performance. In this work, we address the above problem by
proposing Explanation Guided Augmentations (EGA) and Explanation Guided
Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation (EC4SRec) model framework.
The key idea behind EGA is to utilize explanation method(s) to determine items'
importance in a user sequence and derive the positive and negative sequences
accordingly. EC4SRec then combines both self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning over the positive and negative sequences generated by EGA
operations to improve sequence representation learning for more accurate
recommendation results. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark
datasets demonstrate that EC4SRec outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential
recommendation methods and two recent contrastive learning-based sequential
recommendation methods, CL4SRec and DuoRec. Our experiments also show that
EC4SRec can be easily adapted for different sequence encoder backbones (e.g.,
GRU4Rec and Caser), and improve their recommendation performance.

promising approach for enabling low-latency and compute-intensive mobility
applications, such as cooperative and autonomous driving. This work considers
vehicular fog computing scenarios where the clients of computation offloading
services try to minimize their own costs while deciding which VFNs to offload
their tasks. We focus on decentralized multi-agent decision-making in a
repeated unknown game where each agent, e.g., service client, can observe only

(LSS) in the luminosity distance space (LDS), just like galaxies in the
redshift space. It is possible to obtain the $D_L-D_A$ duality relation with
clustering effect. However, several LSS induced errors will contaminate the GW
luminosity distance measurement, such as the peculiar velocity dispersion error
of the host galaxy as well as the foreground lensing magnification. The
distance uncertainties induced from these effects will degrade the GW
clustering from a spectroscopic-like data down to a photometric-like data. In
this paper, we investigate how these LSS induced distance errors modify our
cosmological parameter precision inferred from the LDS clustering. We consider
two of the next generation GW observatories, namely the Big Bang Observatory
(BBO) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). We forecast the parameter estimation
errors on the angular diameter distance $D_A$, luminosity distance space Hubble
parameter $H_L$ and structure growth rate $f_L\sigma_8$ with a Fisher matrix
method. Generally speaking, the GW source clustering data can be used for
cosmological studies below $D_L<5$ Gpc, while above this scale the lensing
errors will increase significantly. We find that for BBO, it is possible to
constrain the cosmological parameters with a relative error of $10^{-3}$ to
$10^{-2}$ below $D_L<5$ Gpc. The velocity dispersion error is dominant in the
low luminosity distance range, while the lensing magnification error is the
bottleneck in the large luminosity distance range. To reduce the lensing error,
we assumed a $50\%$ delensing efficiency. Even with this optimal assumption,
the fractional error increased to $O(1)$ at luminosity distance $D_L=25$ Gpc.
The results for ET are similar as those from BBO. Due to the GW source number
in ET is less than that from BBO, the corresponding results also get a bit
worse.

isolated dark matter halo, we follow the evolution of the spin parameter $a$ of
a black hole (BH) undergoing super-Eddington phases throughout its growth. This
regime, suspected to be accompanied by powerful jet outflows, is expected to
decrease the BH spin magnitude. We combine super-Eddington accretion with
sub-Eddington phases (quasar and radio modes) and follow the BH spin evolution.
Due to the low frequency of super-Eddington episodes, relativistic jets in this
regime are not able to decrease the magnitude of the spin effectively, as thin
disc accretion in the quasar mode inevitably increases the BH spin. The
combination of super- and sub-Eddington accretion does not lead to a simple
explicit expression for the spin evolution because of feedback from
super-Eddington events. An analytical expression can be used to calculate the
evolution for $a\lesssim0.3$, assuming the super-Eddington feedback is
consistently weak. Finally, BHs starting with low spin magnitude are able to
grow to the highest mass, and if they initially start misaligned with the
galactic disc, they get a small boost of accretion through retrograde
accretion.

to generalize poorly in these scenarios. In this paper, we raise an intriguing
question - if the combination of image restoration and object detection, can
boost the performance of cutting-edge detectors in adverse weather conditions.
To answer it, we propose an effective yet unified detection paradigm that
bridges these two subtasks together via dynamic enhancement learning to discern
objects in adverse weather conditions, called TogetherNet. Different from
existing efforts that intuitively apply image dehazing/deraining as a
pre-processing step, TogetherNet considers a multi-task joint learning problem.
Following the joint learning scheme, clean features produced by the restoration
network can be shared to learn better object detection in the detection
network, thus helping TogetherNet enhance the detection capacity in adverse
weather conditions. Besides the joint learning architecture, we design a new
Dynamic Transformer Feature Enhancement module to improve the feature
extraction and representation capabilities of TogetherNet. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
TogetherNet outperforms the state-of-the-art detection approaches by a large

coaxial nanotubes of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), have emerged as
a new area of endeavor in nanoscience. A key to designing and engineering the
properties of such 1D vdW heterostructures lies on understanding the band
alignment of coaxial nanotubes in the heterostructures. However, how curvature,
tube diameters, and intertube coupling affect the band-edge levels and band
alignment of TMDC nanotubes in 1D vdW heterostructures remains unknown. Here,
through comprehensive first-principles calculations and analyses, we establish
a complete framework of band alignment in 1D vdW heterostructures of TMDC
nanotubes. We reveal that, as the diameter of a TMDC nanotube decreases, the
combined effects of curvature-induced flexoelectricity and intrinsic
circumferential tensile strain cause a rapid and continuous lowering of the
conduction band minimum (CBM), whereas the valence band maximum (VBM) exhibits
an initial lowering before rising, which originates from a change in the
orbital character of the VBM. The transition in the orbital character of VBM
also leads to direct-to-indirect bandgap transition in small-diameter armchair
and chiral nanotubes, as well as photoluminescence quenching in zigzag
nanotubes. As individual TMDC nanotubes form coaxial 1D vdW heterostructures,
the effect of intertube coupling via flexovoltage effect can result in a
transition of intertube band alignment from Type II to Type I in multiple
heterostructural systems, including large-diameter MoSe$_2$@WS$_2$,
MoTe$_2$@MoSe$_2$, and MoTe$_2$@WS$_2$ heterostructures. These results lay down

to ~30 pc linear resolution observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array

impact of diffuse emission on this calibration using a structural
decomposition. Separating the thermal and nonthermal emission components, the
correlation between different phases of the interstellar medium and the impact
of massive star formation are also investigated. Radio sources with sizes <~
200 pc constitute about 36% (46%) of the total RC emission at 1.5 GHz (6.3 GHz)
in the inner 18' x 18' (or 4kpc x 4kpc) disk of M 33. The nonthermal spectral
index becomes flatter with increasing star-formation rate surface density,
indicating the escape of cosmic ray electrons {from their birth places}. The
magnetic field strength also increases with star-formation rate following a
bi-modal relation, indicating that the small-scale turbulent dynamo acts more
efficiently at higher luminosities and star-formation rates. Although the
correlations are tighter in star-forming regions, the nonthermal emission is
correlated also with the more quiescent molecular gas in the ISM. An almost
linear molecular star-formation law exists in M 33 when excluding diffuse
structures. Massive star formation amplifies the magnetic field and increases
the number of high-energy cosmic ray electrons, which can help the onset of
winds and outflows.

correct top-K ranking with respect to the conditional probability. This shows
that AUTKC does not allow irrelevant labels to appear in the top list.
Furthermore, we present an empirical surrogate risk minimization framework to
optimize the proposed metric. Theoretically, we present (1) a sufficient
condition for Fisher consistency of the Bayes optimal score function; (2) a
generalization upper bound which is insensitive to the number of classes under
a simple hyperparameter setting. Finally, the experimental results on four

provides local inductive bias and the latter breaks limited receptive field in

reverberation mapping (DRM) estimates the size of the dust emitting region by
measuring the delays between the infrared (IR) response to variability in the
optical light curves. We measure DRM lags of Zw229-015 between optical
ground-based and Kepler light curves and concurrent IR Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5
$\mu$m light curves from 2010-2015, finding an overall mean rest-frame lag of
18.3 $\pm$ 4.5 days. Each combination of optical and IR light curve returns
lags that are consistent with each other within 1$\sigma$, which implies that
the different wavelengths are dominated by the same hot dust emission. The lags
measured for Zw229-015 are found to be consistently smaller than predictions
using the lag-luminosity relationship. Also, the overall IR response to the
optical emission actually depends on the geometry and structure of the dust
emitting region as well, so we use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) modelling to
simulate the dust distribution to further estimate these structural and
geometrical properties. We find that a large increase in flux between the
2011-2012 observation seasons, which is more dramatic in the IR light curve, is
not well simulated by a single dust component. When excluding this increase in
flux, the modelling consistently suggests that the dust is distributed in an
extended flat disk, and finds a mean inclination angle of 49$^{+3}_{-13}$
degrees.

existing studies employ the embedding-based reasoning models to infer the

ineffective fusion of multi-modal auxiliary features; (2) lack of complex

emerging paradigm that provides privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple

noisy labels in the datasets of the participants degrade the performance and
increase the number of communication rounds for convergence of federated
learning. Such large communication rounds require more time and energy to train
the model. In this paper, we propose a federated learning approach to suppress
the unequal distribution of the noisy labels in the dataset of each

each participant and normalizes the noise ratio using the server dataset. The
proposed approach can handle bias in the server dataset and minimizes its
impact on the participants' dataset. Next, we calculate the optimal weighted
contributions of the participants using the normalized noise ratio and
influence of each participant. We further derive the expression to estimate the

Additionally, we examine the controller complexity by two measures, one of

This creates the problem that embodied intelligence is correlated with a
reduced necessity of a controller, a brain. However, in order to interact well
with their surroundings, the agents first have to understand the relevant
dynamics of the environment. By analyzing learning agents we observe that an
increased controller complexity can facilitate a better interaction between an

their mechanical behavior. The first coupling fabric is the Biot's theory
according to which fluid pressure interacts with solid stress state and
volumetric deformation rate of the solid induces changes in fluid pressure.
Another coupling mechanism emerges with cracks which serve as channels for the
fluid to flow through them and provide volume for fluid storage. Especially the
second coupling mechanism presents a challenge for numerical modeling as it
requires detailed knowledge about cracking process. Discrete mesoscale
mechanical models coupled with mass transport offer simple and robust way to
solve the problem. On the other hand, however, they are computationally
demanding. In order to reduce this computational burden, the present paper
applies the asymptotic expansion homogenization technique to the coupled
problem to deliver (i) continuous and homogeneous description of the
macroscopic problem which can be easily solved by the finite element method,
(ii) discrete and heterogeneous mesoscale problem in the periodic setup
attached to each integration point of the macroscale along with (iii) equations
providing communication between these two scales. The transient terms appear at
the macroscale only, as well as the Biot's coupling terms. The coupling through
cracking is treated at the mesoscale by changing conductivity of the conduit
elements according to the mechanical solution, otherwise the two mesoscale
steady state problems are decoupled and can be therefore solved in a sequence.

Asymptotic expansion homogenization is applied to distinguish between (i) the

boxes and study the large-scale outflow structure and radiation properties of
super-Eddington accretion flow for a variety of black hole accretion rates,
${\dot M}_{\rm BH} = (110 - 380) ~L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$. The Keplerian radius of the
inflow material, at which centrifugal force balances with gravitational force,
is fixed to 2430 Schwarzschild radii.We find that the mechanical luminosity
grows more rapidly than the radiation luminosity with an increase of ${\dot
M}_{\rm BH}$. When seen from a nearly face-on direction, especially, the
isotropic mechanical luminosity grows in proportion to ${\dot M}_{\rm
BH}^{2.7}$, while the total mechanical luminosity is proportional to ${\dot
M}_{\rm BH}^{1.7}$. The reason for the former is that the higher ${\dot M}_{\rm
BH}$ is, the more vertically inflated becomes the disk surface, which makes
radiation fields more confined in the region around the rotation axis, thereby
strongly accelerating outflowing gas. The outflow is classified into pure
outflow and failed outflow, depending whether outflowing gas can reach the
outer boundary of the simulation box or not. The fraction of the failed outflow
decreases with a decrease of ${\dot M}_{\rm BH}$. We analyze physical
quantities along each outflow trajectory, finding that the Bernoulli parameter
($Be$) is not a good indicator to discriminate pure and failed outflows, since
it is never constant because of continuous acceleration by radiation-pressure
force.Pure outflow can arise, even if $Be < 0$ at the launching point.

estimates which are efficient with respect to the prescribed approximation

performed using density functionals at the level of Generalized Gradient
Approximation (GGA). The challenge in modelling ET reactions is the poor
quality of GGA functionals in predicting properties of such open-shell systems
due to the inevitable self-interaction error (SIE). While hybrid functionals
can minimize SIE, AIMD at that level of theory is typically 150 times slower
than GGA for systems containing ~100 atoms. Among several approaches reported
to speed-up AIMD simulations with hybrid functionals, the noise-stabilized MD
(NSMD) procedure, together with the use of localized orbitals to compute the
required exchange integrals, is an attractive option. In this work, we
demonstrate the application of the NSMD approach for studying the

formed using a constant fluid volume, ruptured with a needle, and recorded
using a high-speed camera. We show that colloidal films rupture in a manner
quantitatively similar to Newtonian fluids, even well into the shear thinning
regime. These results are consistent with the well-known mechanism of the
rupture of Newtonian films, where the rupture rim rolls outward collecting more
fluid and thus film rupture is a shear-free process. However, in the case of
spontaneous rupture under controlled humidity conditions, the same dense
colloidal films show exotic instabilities reminiscent of a wrinkling fabric on
the film surface. These instabilities were absent in manually ruptured films.
We hypothesize that these instabilities occur when the film thickness becomes
thin enough to compete with the colloidal particle size, due to film drainage
before spontaneous rupture. Thus, although non-Newtonian flow properties do not
influence film rupture dynamics for thick enough films, the effect of
microstructure has dramatic consequences in thinner films.

  Min-Hsiu Hsieh","Counting stabiliser codes for arbitrary dimension","10 pages + 7 pages of appendices. Comments are welcome",,,,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this work, we compute the number of $[[n,k]]_d$ stabiliser codes made up
of $d$-dimensional qudits, for arbitrary positive integers $d$. In a seminal
work by Gross (Ref. 22) the number of $[[n,k]]_d$ stabilizer codes was computed
for the case when $d$ is a prime (or the power of a prime, i.e., $d=p^m$, but
when the qudits are Galois-qudits). The proof in Ref. 22 is inapplicable to the
non-prime case. For our proof, we introduce a group structure to $[[n,k]]_d$
codes, and use this in conjunction with the Chinese remainder theorem to count
the number of $[[n,k]]_d$ codes. Our work overlaps with Ref. 22 when $d$ is a
prime and in this case our results match exactly, but the results differ for
the more generic case. Despite that, the overall order of magnitude of the
number of stabilizer codes scales agnostic of whether the dimension is prime or
non-prime. This is surprising since the method employed to count the number of
stabilizer states (or more generally stabilizer codes) depends on whether $d$
is prime or not. The cardinality of stabilizer states, which was so far known
only for the prime-dimensional case (and the Galois qudit prime-power
dimensional case) plays an important role as a quantifier in many topics in
quantum computing. Salient among these are the resource theory of magic, design
theory, de Finetti theorem for stabilizer states, the study and optimisation of
the classical simulability of Clifford circuits, the optimal verification of
stabilizer states, the study of quantum contextuality of small-dimensional
systems and the study of Wigner-functions. Our work makes available this
quantifier for the generic case, and thus is an important step needed to place
results for quantum computing with non-prime dimensional quantum systems on the
same pedestal as prime-dimensional systems.

in multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy favors the canting of
spins in the in-plane direction and could thus enable new exciting spin
textures such as Hopfions in continuous multilayer films. A key requirement is
to control the IL-DMI and so in this study, the influence of an electric
current on the IL-DMI is investigated by out-of-plane hysteresis loops of the
anomalous Hall effect under applied in-plane magnetic fields. The direction of
the in-plane field is varied to obtain a full azimuthal dependence, which
allows us to quantify the effect on the IL-DMI. We observe a shift in the
azimuthal dependence of the IL-DMI with increasing current, which can be
understood from the additional in-plane symmetry breaking introduced by the
current flow. Using an empirical model of two superimposed cosine functions we
demonstrate the presence of a current-induced term that linearly increases the
IL-DMI in the direction of current flow. With this, a new easily accessible
possibility to manipulate 3D spin textures by current is realized. As most
spintronic devices employ spin-transfer or spin-orbit torques to manipulate
spin textures, the foundation to implement current-induced IL-DMI into
thin-film devices is broadly available.

endogenously because of learning-by-consuming. A seller sells one unit of a
divisible good, while the buyer relies on his private, rough valuation to
choose his first-stage consumption level. Consuming more leads to a more
precise valuation estimate, after which the buyer determines the second-stage
consumption level. The optimum is a menu of try-and-decide contracts,
consisting of a first-stage price-quantity pair and a second-stage per-unit
price for the remaining quantity. In equilibrium, a higher first-stage
valuation buyer pays more for higher first-stage consumption and enjoys a lower
second-stage per-unit price. Methodologically, we deal with the difficulty that
due to the failure of single-crossing condition, monotonicity in allocation
plus the envelope condition is insufficient for incentive compatibility. Our
results help to understand contracts about sequential consumption with the
learning feature; e.g., leasing contracts for experience goods and trial
sessions for certain courses.

and styles by using semantic maps and learned image style vectors. The
instantiation module integrates geometrical and topological information and
generates accurate nuclei boundaries. We validate the proposed approach on a
multiple-organ dataset, Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method generates more realistic histopathology images than four
state-of-the-art approaches for five organs. By incorporating synthetic images
from the proposed approach to model training, an instance segmentation network
can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

order as the Hessian matrix might be helpful to correct the Hessian matrix.
Chiang applied something between a column vector and a square matrix, namely a
diagonal matrix, to accelerate the gradient and further proposed a faster
gradient variant called quadratic gradient. In this paper, we present a new way
to build a new version of the quadratic gradient. This new quadratic gradient
doesn't satisfy the convergence conditions of the fixed Hessian Newton's
method. However, experimental results show that it sometimes has a better
performance than the original one in convergence rate. Also, Chiang speculates
that there might be a relation between the Hessian matrix and the learning rate
for the first-order gradient descent method. We prove that the floating number
$\frac{1}{\epsilon + \max \{| \lambda_i | \}}$ can be a good learning rate of
the gradient methods, where $\epsilon$ is a number to avoid division by zero

experiments involving unmodified or modified nucleic acids. In presence of
hysteresis, the thermal curves are irreversible and demand a significant effort

article, we describe a unified statistical procedure to analyze such thermal
curves. Our method applies to experiments with intramolecular as well as
intermolecular reactions. More specifically, the proposed method allows one to
handle the thermal curves for the formation of duplexes, triplexes, and various
quadruplexes in exactly the same way. The proposed method uses a local
polynomial regression for finding the smoothed thermal curves and calculating
their slopes. This method is more flexible and easy to implement than the least
squares polynomial smoothing which is currently almost universally used for
such purposes. Full analyses of the curves including computation of kinetic and
thermodynamic parameters can be done using freely available statistical
software. In the end, we illustrate our method by analyzing irreversible curves
encountered in the formations of a G-quadruplex and an LNA-modified parallel
duplex.
