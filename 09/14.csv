  OpenFOAM",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Thanks to the computational power of modern cluster machines, numerical
simulations can provide, with an unprecedented level of details, new insights
into fluid mechanics. However, taking full advantage of this hardware remains
challenging since data communication remains a significant bottleneck to
reaching peak performances. Reducing floating point precision is a simple and
effective way to reduce data movement and improve the computational speed of
most applications. Nevertheless, special care needs to be taken to ensure the
quality and convergence of computed solutions, especially when dealing with
complex fluid simulations. In this work, we analyse the impact of reduced
(single and mixed compared to double) precision on computational performance
and accuracy for computational fluid dynamics. Using the open source library
OpenFOAM, we consider incompressible, compressible, and multiphase fluid
solvers for testing on relevant benchmarks for flows in the laminar and
turbulent regime and in the presence of shock waves. Computational gain and
changes in the scalability of applications in reduced precision are also
discussed. In particular, an ad hoc theoretical model for the strong scaling
allows us to interpret and understand the observed behaviors, as a function of
floating point precision and hardware specifics. Finally, we show how reduced
precision can significantly speed up a hybrid CPU-GPU implementation, made
available to OpenFOAM end-users recently, that simply relies on a GPU linear
algebra solver developed by hardware vendors.

blood flow conditions in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). This
requires patient-specific anatomy, usually obtained from segmented 3D
cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images. However, segmentation is
time-consuming and needs expert input. This study aims to develop and validate
a machine learning (ML) method for segmentation of the aorta and pulmonary
arteries (PAs) for CFD studies.
  Methods: 90 CHD patients were retrospectively selected for this study. 3D CMR
images were manually segmented to obtain ground-truth (GT) background, aorta
and PA labels. These were used to train and optimize a U-Net model.
Segmentation performance was primarily evaluated using Dice score. CFD
simulations were set up from GT and ML segmentations using a semi-automatic
meshing and simulation pipeline. Pressure and velocity fields were computed,
and a mean average percentage error (MAPE) was calculated for each vessel pair.
A secondary observer (SO) segmented the test dataset to assess inter-observer
variability. Friedman tests were used to compare segmentation metrics and flow
field errors.
  Results: The model's Dice score (ML vs GT) was 0.945 for the aorta and 0.885
for the PAs. Differences with the inter-observer Dice score (SO vs GT) and ML
vs SO Dice scores were not statistically significant for either aorta or PAs.
The ML vs GT MAPEs for pressure and velocity in the aorta were 10.1% and 4.1%
respectively, and for the PAs 14.6% and 6.3%, respectively. Inter-observer (SO
vs GT) and ML vs SO pressure and velocity MAPEs were of a similar magnitude to
ML vs GT.
  Conclusions: The proposed method can successfully segment the great vessels
for CFD, with errors similar to inter-observer variability. This reduces the
time and effort needed for CFD analysis, making it more attractive for routine
clinical use.

enrichments, modules over functors and graphical calculus. We define several of
these in different settings. The first takes a category to a monoidal category
and the second is an endofunctor for monoidal categories. There are localized
and unital versions of these constructions. These serve three main purposes.
The first is to define a notion that generalizes modules over algebras to
monoidal functors and modules. This is realized via indexed enrichment. The
second is to provide a theory of twists, and the third is to classify relative
bimodules over a given groupoid. In this guise they classify bi-module monoids
with respect to a plethysm products over a the homomorphisms of a category
thought of as a bi-module of the underlying groupoid. The presented plus
constructions generalize the plus construction for Feynman categories and
explain the appearance of the plethysm monoid definition for operads, properads
and props. To this end we introduce a new notion of unique factorization
category (UFC) and show that the plus construction of a hereditary UFC is a
Feynman category. Just as finite sets are the fundamental indexing Feynman
category cospans are the fundamental indexing category hereditary UFC. We give
a local presentation of these constructions as well as a global description of
the morphisms and a graphical version using decorated groupoid colored graphs.
We furthermore consider an enriched setting. The global presentation utilizes
pasting diagram from 2-categories or equivalently double categories, which is
of independent interest. The graphical description is a consequence of the
local definition. In the special case of a UFC there is also a formalism with

corrugations and calculate the interaction energy perturbatively up to the
second order in corrugation amplitude. The ratio of corresponding maximum
lateral Casimir force to normal Casimir force is defined as the coefficient of
static friction, which is found to be independent of the dielectric properties
of the materials. It depends on the geometric properties, like interlayer
separation, corrugation amplitude, and wavelength of the corrugation. As a
proof of concept, our predicted values of $\mu_s$ for the 2D van der Waals
materials graphene and hexagonal boron nitride are in reasonable agreement with
previously reported values in the literature. This simplistic model could be
generalized by incorporating other forces, such as the frequency-dependent

possible to transport charge through a system even without net external
electric or magnetic fields, known as Thouless charge pumping. The amount of
charge pumped in a cycle is quantized and entirely determined by the system's
topology, which is robust against perturbations such as disorder and
interactions. However, coupling to the environment may play a vital role in
topological transport in many-body systems. We study the topological Thouless
pumping, where the charge carriers interact with local optical phonons. The
semi-classical multi-trajectory Ehrenfest method is employed to treat the
phonon trajectories classically and charge carriers quantum mechanically. We
find a breakdown of the quantized charge transport in the presence of phonons.
It happens for any finite electron-phonon coupling strength at the resonance
condition when the pumping frequency matches the phonon frequency, and it takes
finite phonon coupling strength away from the resonance. Moreover, there exist
parameter regimes with non-quantized negative and positive charge transport.
The modified effective pumping path due to electron-phonon coupling accurately
explains the underlying physics. In the large coupling regime where the pumping
disappears, the phonons are found to eliminate the staggering of the onsite
potentials, which is necessary for the pumping protocol. Finally, we present a
stability diagram of quantized pumping as a function of time period of pumping
and phonon coupling strength.

assume that the system is equipped with a finite set of trained NN controllers.
Each controller has been trained so that it can drive the system towards a
specific region of interest while avoiding others. Our goal is to check if
there exists a temporal composition of the trained NN controllers - and if so,
to compute it - that will yield composite system behaviors that satisfy a
user-specified LTL task for any initial system state belonging to a given set.
To address this problem, we propose a new approach that relies on a novel
integration of automata theory and recently proposed reachability analysis
tools for NN-controlled systems. We note that the proposed method can be
applied to other controllers, not necessarily modeled by NNs, by appropriate
selection of the reachability analysis tool. We focus on NN controllers due to
their lack of robustness. The proposed method is demonstrated on navigation

stable within particular temperature regimes. First order phase transitions

stretched cosmological dS$_2$ horizon. We speculate on candidate microphysical

wide range of applications. The typical formulation of the problem involves two
stages: detect mention boundaries and link all mentions to a knowledge base.
For a long time, mention detection has been considered as a necessary step for
extracting all entities in a piece of text, even if the information about
mention spans is ignored by some downstream applications that merely focus on
the set of extracted entities. In this paper we show that, in such cases,
detection of mention boundaries does not bring any considerable performance
gain in extracting entities, and therefore can be skipped. To conduct our
analysis, we propose an ""Entity Tagging"" formulation of the problem, where
models are evaluated purely on the set of extracted entities without

linking solution against GET, a mention-agnostic sequence-to-sequence model

availability for geographically replicated applications. Wide-area consensus is
challenging due to two main reasons: (1) low throughput due to the high latency
overhead of client request dissemination and (2) network asynchrony that causes
consensus protocols to lose liveness. In this paper, we propose Mandator and
Sporades, a modular state machine replication algorithm that enables high
performance and resiliency in the wide-area setting.
  To address the high client request dissemination overhead challenge, we
propose Mandator, a novel consensus-agnostic asynchronous dissemination layer.
Mandator separates client request dissemination from the critical path of
consensus to obtain high performance. Composing Mandator with Multi-Paxos
(Mandator-Paxos) delivers significantly high throughput under synchronous
networks. However, under asynchronous network conditions, Mandator-Paxos loses
liveness which results in high latency. To achieve low latency and robustness
under asynchrony, we propose Sporades, a novel omission fault-tolerant
consensus algorithm. Sporades consists of two modes of operations --
synchronous and asynchronous -- that always ensure liveness. The combination of
Mandator and Sporades (Mandator-Sporades) provides a robust and high-performing
state machine replication system.
  We implement and evaluate Mandator-Sporades in a wide-area deployment running
on Amazon EC2. Our evaluation shows that in the synchronous execution,
Mandator-Sporades achieves 300k tx/sec throughput in less than 900ms latency,
outperforming Multi-Paxos, EPaxos and Rabia by 650\% in throughput, at a modest
expense of latency. Furthermore, we show that Mandator-Sporades outperforms
Mandator-Paxos, Multi-Paxos, and EPaxos in the face of targeted distributed

promising solution to the problem of hyperparameter selection and adaptation in
non-stationary reinforcement learning problems. However, the properties of
meta-gradients in such environments have not been systematically studied. In
this work, we bring new clarity to meta-gradients in non-stationary
environments. Concretely, we ask: (i) how much information should be given to
the learned optimizers, so as to enable faster adaptation and generalization
over a lifetime, (ii) what meta-optimizer functions are learned in this
process, and (iii) whether meta-gradient methods provide a bigger advantage in
highly non-stationary environments. To study the effect of information provided
to the meta-optimizer, as in recent works (Flennerhag et al., 2021; Almeida et
al., 2021), we replace the tuned meta-parameters of fixed update rules with
learned meta-parameter functions of selected context features. The context
features carry information about agent performance and changes in the
environment and hence can inform learned meta-parameter schedules. We find that
adding more contextual information is generally beneficial, leading to faster
adaptation of meta-parameter values and increased performance over a lifetime.
We support these results with a qualitative analysis of resulting
meta-parameter schedules and learned functions of context features. Lastly, we
find that without context, meta-gradients do not provide a consistent advantage
over the baseline in highly non-stationary environments. Our findings suggest
that contextualizing meta-gradients can play a pivotal role in extracting high
performance from meta-gradients in non-stationary settings.

models (DDPM) are distribution learning-based models, which try to transform a
normal distribution into a specific data distribution based on iterative
refinements. In this work, we proposed and evaluated different DDPM-based
methods for PET image denoising. Under the DDPM framework, one way to perform
PET image denoising is to provide the PET image and/or the prior image as the
network input. Another way is to supply the prior image as the input with the
PET image included in the refinement steps, which can fit for scenarios of
different noise levels. 120 18F-FDG datasets and 140 18F-MK-6240 datasets were
utilized to evaluate the proposed DDPM-based methods. Quantification show that
the DDPM-based frameworks with PET information included can generate better
results than the nonlocal mean and Unet-based denoising methods. Adding
additional MR prior in the model can help achieve better performance and
further reduce the uncertainty during image denoising. Solely relying on MR
prior while ignoring the PET information can result in large bias. Regional and
surface quantification shows that employing MR prior as the network input while
embedding PET image as a data-consistency constraint during inference can
achieve the best performance. In summary, DDPM-based PET image denoising is a
flexible framework, which can efficiently utilize prior information and achieve
better performance than the nonlocal mean and Unet-based denoising methods.

conjecture on simple graphs, which states that for any forest $F$, there is
some function $f$ such that every $F$-free graph $G$ with clique number
$\omega(G)$ has chromatic number at most $f(\omega(G))$. Aboulker, Charbit, and
Naserasr [Extension of Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner Conjecture to Digraphs; E-JC 2021]
proposed an analogue of this conjecture to the dichromatic number of oriented
graphs. The dichromatic number of a digraph $D$ is the minimum number of colors
required to color the vertex set of $D$ so that no directed cycle in $D$ is
monochromatic.
  Aboulker, Charbit, and Naserasr's $\overrightarrow{\chi}$-boundedness
conjecture states that for every oriented forest $F$, there is some function
$f$ such that every $F$-free oriented graph $D$ has dichromatic number at most
$f(\omega(D))$, where $\omega(D)$ is the size of a maximum clique in the graph

Aboulker, Charbit, and Naserasr's $\overrightarrow{\chi}$-boundedness

concentrations of dominant structural units. Thermodynamically, any
glass-former is expected to behave as multi-component solution and solidify in
continuous temperature range between apparent liquidus and solidus temperatures
that can be identified as glass-transition range. Using extended irreversible
thermodynamics of polydisperse solutions it is demonstrated that upon
quenching, diffusional and Brownian mass transport in such solutions is negated
within heat removal timescale, which results in dynamical arrest of nucleation
and growth in clusters and solid-liquid phase separation. Rapid solution
solidification proceeds via successive cluster freezing in continuous
temperature range, in line with cluster size dispersity, which can be described
in terms of percolation in static polydisperse fractal ensemble where glass
transition temperature naturally emerges as percolation threshold.
Multi-component solution solidification framework is shown to be reconcilable
qualitatively and quantitatively with the Mode Coupling - Random First Order
Transition scenario. Finally, it is demonstrated that liquid-to-glass
transformation is thermodynamic liquid-to-solid phase transition, glassy state

uncertainty quantification, one is interested in analyzing the stochastic

solving high-dimensional integrals of the PDE output over a sequence of
stochastic variables. In practical computations, one typically needs to
discretize the problem in several ways: approximating an infinite-dimensional
input random field with a finite-dimensional random field, spatial
discretization of the PDE using, e.g., finite elements, and approximating
high-dimensional integrals using cubatures such as quasi-Monte Carlo methods.
In this paper, we focus on the error resulting from dimension truncation of an
input random field. We show how Taylor series can be used to derive theoretical
dimension truncation rates for a wide class of problems and we provide a simple
checklist of conditions that a parametric mathematical model needs to satisfy
in order for our dimension truncation error bound to hold. Some of the novel
features of our approach include that our results are applicable to non-affine

heterophilous graphs are challenging for standard message-passing graph neural
networks (GNNs), and much effort has been put into developing efficient methods
for this setting. However, there is no universally agreed-upon measure of
homophily in the literature. In this work, we show that commonly used homophily
measures have critical drawbacks preventing the comparison of homophily levels

proper homophily measure and verify which measures satisfy which properties. In
particular, we show that a measure that we call adjusted homophily satisfies
more desirable properties than other popular homophily measures while being
rarely used in graph learning literature. Then, we go beyond the
homophily-heterophily dichotomy and propose a new characteristic allowing one
to further distinguish different sorts of heterophily. The proposed label
informativeness (LI) characterizes how much information a neighbor's label
provides about a node's label. We analyze LI via the same theoretical framework

Bayesian neural gradient matching (BNGM), which relies on interpolating time
series with neural networks, and fitting NODEs to the interpolated dynamics
with Bayesian regularisation. We test the accuracy of the approach by inferring
ecological interactions in time series generated by an ODE model with known
interactions. We also infer interactions in experimentally replicated time
series of a microcosm featuring an algae, flagellate, and rotifer population,
as well as in the hare and lynx system. 3. Our BNGM approach allows us to cut
down the fitting time of NODE systems to only a few seconds. The method
provides accurate estimates of ecological interactions in the artificial

error. In the real systems, dynamics are driven by a mixture of linear and
nonlinear ecological interactions, of which only the strongest are consistent
across replicates. 4. Overall, NODEs alleviate the need for a mechanistic
understanding of interactions, and BNGM alleviates the heavy computational

evaluated the effectiveness of HistoPerm on two histology image datasets for

embedding architecture-based representation learning methods: BYOL, SimCLR, and
VICReg. Our results show that HistoPerm consistently improves patch- and
slide-level classification performance in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC.
Specifically, for patch-level classification accuracy on the Celiac disease

accurate only for small bulk band gaps and/or smooth domain walls. For larger
bulk band gaps and hard domain walls backscattering is expected to become
significant. Here, we show that in this experimentally relevant regime, the
reflection of a wave at a sharp corner becomes highly sensitive on the
orientation of the outgoing waveguide relative to the underlying lattice.
Enhanced backscattering can be understood as being triggered by resonant
tunneling transitions in quasimomentum space. Tracking the resonant tunneling

many-body state followed by appropriate measurements effectively implements
quantum computation in the spatial direction. We argue that this computation
can be made deterministic by enforcing a Clifford condition, and is generically
universal. Remarkably, all these requirements can already be satisfied by the
dynamics of the paradigmatic kicked Ising chain at specific parameter choices.
Specifically, after $k$ time-steps, equivalent to a depth-$k$ quantum circuit,
we obtain a resource state for universal MBQC on $\sim 3k/4$ encoded logical

source image, allowing for better generalization to narratives with new
characters. Then, we enhance or 'retro-fit' the pretrained text-to-image
synthesis models with task-specific modules for (a) sequential image generation
and (b) copying relevant elements from an initial frame. Then, we explore
full-model finetuning, as well as prompt-based tuning for parameter-efficient
adaptation, of the pre-trained model. We evaluate our approach StoryDALL-E on
two existing datasets, PororoSV and FlintstonesSV, and introduce a new dataset
DiDeMoSV collected from a video-captioning dataset. We also develop a model
StoryGANc based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for story
continuation, and compare it with the StoryDALL-E model to demonstrate the
advantages of our approach. We show that our retro-fitting approach outperforms
GAN-based models for story continuation and facilitates copying of visual
elements from the source image, thereby improving continuity in the generated
visual story. Finally, our analysis suggests that pretrained transformers
struggle to comprehend narratives containing several characters. Overall, our
work demonstrates that pretrained text-to-image synthesis models can be adapted
for complex and low-resource tasks like story continuation.

a maximum when we vary the system size, indicating that the distinguishability

T-even heavy quarks and leptons with masses proportional to just two sets of
Yukawa matrices in flavor space, one more than in the LHT. The new scalars are
a singlet and real triplet, T-odd, with masses controlled by gauge and Yukawa
couplings, independent of the spontaneous symmetry breaking scale $f$, and
hence potentially light. Imposing that no mass exceeds the cutoff scale,
applying current lower bounds on vector-like quarks and assuming a simplified
model with mass degenerate heavy fermions compatible with the heavy photon as
dark matter constituent, we find that $f$ gets constrained within the interval
between 2 and 3 TeV, the common Yukawa coupling of heavy leptons gets fixed and
the Yukawa coupling of heavy quarks becomes greatly correlated to the top quark
Yukawa couplings. The particle spectrum is then bounded from below and above,
with the (lightest) heavy photon at about 0.5 TeV, not far from the heavy
leptons, the new scalars below 1 TeV, the usual complex scalar triplet close to
the heavy weak bosons at about 1.5 to 2.5 TeV, and the heavy quarks and top
quark partners between 2 and 5 TeV. The new scalars decay predominantly to a
standard and a T-odd lepton and have a width comparable to that of the Higgs.

outgassing of cooling magma oceans. During this stage, vigorous convective
motions in the molten interior are believed to rapidly transport the dissolved
volatiles to shallow depths where they exsolve and burst at the surface. This
assumption of efficient degassing and atmosphere formation has important
implications for planetary evolution, but has never been tested against fluid
dynamics considerations. Yet, during a convective cycle, only a finite fraction
of the magma ocean can reach the shallow depths where volatiles exsolution can
occur, and a large-scale circulation may prevent a substantial magma ocean
volume from rapidly reaching the planetary surface. Therefore, we conducted
computational fluid dynamics experiments of vigorous 2D and 3D
Rayleigh-B\'enard convection at Prandtl number of unity to characterize the
ability of the convecting fluid to reach shallow depths at which volatiles are
exsolved and extracted to the atmosphere. Outgassing efficiency is essentially
a function of the magnitude of the convective velocities. This allows deriving
simple expressions to predict the time evolution of the amount of outgassed
volatiles as a function of the magma ocean governing parameters. For plausible
cases, the time required to exsolve all oversaturated water can exceed the
magma ocean lifetime in a given highly vigorous transient stage, leading to
incomplete or even negligible outgassing. Furthermore, the planet size and the
initial magma ocean water content, through the convective vigor and the
exsolution depth, respectively, strongly affect magma oceans degassing
efficiency, possibly leading to divergent planetary evolution paths and
resulting surface conditions. Overall, despite vigorous convection, for a
significant range of parameters, convective degassing appears not as efficient
as previously thought.

cannot be created in finite time using local unitary circuits, or equivalently,
adiabatic state preparation. Recently it has come to light that single-site
measurements provide a loophole, allowing for finite-time state preparation in
certain cases. Here we show how this observation imposes a complexity hierarchy
on long-range entangled states based on the minimal number of measurement
layers required to create the state, which we call ``shots''. First, similar to
Abelian stabilizer states, we construct single-shot protocols for creating any
non-Abelian quantum double of a group with nilpotency class two (such as $D_4$
or $Q_8$). Preparing such non-Abelian topological order does not require
feedforward -- gates which depend on previous measurement outcomes are only
necessary for multiple shots. Second, we provide the first constructive proof
that a finite number of shots can implement the Kramers-Wannier duality
transformation (i.e., the gauging map) for any solvable symmetry group. As a
special case, this gives an explicit protocol to prepare twisted quantum double
for all solvable groups. Third, we argue that certain topological orders, such
as non-solvable quantum doubles or Fibonacci anyons, define non-trivial phases
of matter under the equivalence class of finite-depth unitaries and
measurement, which cannot be prepared by any finite number of shots. Moreover,
we explore the consequences of allowing gates to have exponentially small
tails, which enables, for example, the preparation of any Abelian anyon theory,
including chiral ones. This hierarchy paints a new picture of the landscape of
long-range entangled states, with practical implications for quantum
simulators.

calculations of when and where the injection of enriched material, momentum,
and energy takes place. INFERNO treats early stellar kinematics to include
phenomena such as walkaway and runaway stars. We employ this innovative model
on simulations of a dwarf galaxy and demonstrate that our physically motivated
stellar feedback model can drive vigorous galactic winds. This is quantified by
mass and metal loading factors in the range of $10-100$, and an energy loading
factor close to unity. Outflows are established close to the disc, are highly
multi-phase, spanning almost $8$ orders of magnitude in temperature, and with a
clear dichotomy between mass ejected in cold, slow-moving

ejected in hot, fast-moving ($T>10^6\,{\rm K}$, $v>100\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$) gas.
In contrast to massive disc galaxies, we find a surprisingly weak impact of the
early stellar kinematics, with runaway stars having little to no effect on our
results, despite exploding in diffuse gas outside the dense star-forming gas,
as well as outside the galactic disc entirely. We demonstrate that this weak
impact in dwarf galaxies stems from a combination of strong feedback and a
porous interstellar medium, which obscure any unique signatures that runaway

remains gapless up to a critical field $h^{c_1}_{xy}$. Surprisingly, above

polarized state at $h^{c_2}_{xy}$. This phase is characterized by a staggered
vector chirality and for periodic boundary conditions, a two-fold degeneracy
with a finite gap. For open boundary systems the ground-state exhibits a single
soliton, lowering the energy, and gapless excitations. However, the
corresponding anti-soliton raises the energy sufficiently that a gap appears
for soliton and anti-soliton pairs in periodic systems. An intuitive

mesoscale patterns near zero temperature phase transitions, also known as
quantum phase transitions (QPTs). Here we report the magnetic susceptibility of
LiHoF$_4$ -- a dipolar Ising ferromagnet -- near a well-understood
transverse-field quantum critical point (TF-QCP). When tilting the magnetic
field away from the hard axis such that the Ising symmetry is always broken, a
line of well-defined phase transitions emerges from the TF-QCP characteristic
of an additional symmetry breaking, in stark contrast to a crossover expected
microscopically. We show that a continuous suppression of ferromagnetic
domains, representing a breaking of translation symmetry on mesoscopic scales
in an environment of broken magnetic Ising symmetry on microscopic scales, is
in excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the field- and
temperature dependence of the susceptibility and the magnetic phase diagram of
LiHoF$_4$ under tilted field. This identifies a new type of phase transition
that may be referred to as mesocale quantum criticality, which emanates from
the text-book example of a microscopic ferromagnetic TF-QCP. Our results
establish the surroundings of QPTs as a regime of mesoscale pattern formation,

structure efficiently. We measure the anisotropic imprint in the local power
spectrum from the tidal separate universe simulations with GWs, which
corresponds to the scalar-scalar-tensor bispectrum in squeezed limit or the
so-called power spectrum response to GWs. We also detect the halo tidal bias
induced by GWs from the response of the halo-matter cross-power spectrum to
GWs, as well as the linear shape bias (or the linear alignment coefficient)
induced by GWs from the one-point function of the halo ellipticity. In contrast
to the case of the tidal field induced by scalar perturbations, we discover
that the wavenumber dependence of the temporal evolution of GWs naturally
causes these biases to be scale-dependent. We also find that this scale
dependence is well approximated by the second-order density induced by the
coupling between scalar and tensor perturbation. This highlights that the
structure formation, especially the process to determine the halo shape, is
nonlocal in time. Our findings lay the foundation for predicting the impact of

magnetized relativistic plasma. Their primary jet, whose emission typically
spans from low-frequency radio to very high-energy ($\gtrsim0.1$ TeV)
$\gamma$-rays (Blandford et al., 2019), is aligned towards our line of sight.
Multiwavelength polarization is a crucial probe of the magnetic field structure
and emission processes in such jets. Until now, sensitive polarization
observations have been limited to the radio, infrared, and optical range,
thereby leaving a gap in our knowledge of the physical conditions experienced
by the most energetic particles. Here, we report the first-ever detection of
X-ray polarization from the jet in an accreting supermassive black hole system,
the blazar Markarian 501 (Mrk 501). The recently launched Imaging X-ray
Polarimetry Explorer ($IXPE$, Weisskopf et al., 2022) measures a linear
polarization degree ($\Pi$) over the 2-8 keV X-ray energy range of 10$\pm$2%
with an electric vector position angle of 134$^\circ\pm$5$^\circ$, parallel to
the radio jet. The X-ray $\Pi$ is more than a factor of 2 higher than the
optical $\Pi$. We conclude that an energy-stratified relativistic electron
population, i.e., an acceleration scenario where the higher energy particles
emit from more magnetically ordered regions closer to the acceleration site, is
the most likely explanation of the higher degree of polarization at X-ray
energies. A second $IXPE$ observation conducted 16 days later yielded similar
results, strengthening our conclusions.

derive a non-perturbative relation between primordial non-Gaussianity and the
leading term in the squeezed bispectrum, revising some results present in the
literature. This relation is then used to successfully measure $f_{\rm NL}$
from $N$-body simulations. We discuss the dependence of our results on
different scale cuts and redshifts. Specifically, the analysis is strongly
dependent on the choice of the smallest soft momentum, $q_{\rm min}$, which is
the most sensitive to primordial bispectrum contributions, but is largely
independent of the choice of the largest hard momentum, $k_{\rm max}$, due to
the non-Gaussian nature of the covariance. We also show how the constraints on
$f_{\rm NL}$ improve at higher redshift, due to a reduced off-diagonal
covariance. In particular, for a simulation with $f_{\rm NL} = 100$ and a
volume of $(2.4 \text{ Gpc}/h)^3$, we measure $f_{\rm NL} = 98 \pm 12$ at
redshift $z=0$ and $f_{\rm NL} = 97 \pm 8$ at $z=0.97$. Finally, we compare our
results with a Fisher forecast, showing that the current version of the
analysis is satisfactorily close to the Fisher error. We regard this as a first
step towards the realistic application of consistency relations to constrain
primordial non-Gaussianity using observations.

population-dynamical models deliver a comprehensive view of the whole system,
and allow us to disentangle the different stellar populations. We explore their
dynamical interplay and confirm our previous findings about the build-up of
Sgr's nuclear cluster via contributions from globular cluster stars, Sgr inner
field stars, and in-situ star formation. We explore various parameterisations
of the gravitational potential and show the importance of a radially varying
mass-to-light ratio for the proper treatment of the mass profile. We find a
total dynamical mass within M54's tidal radius ($\sim75$ pc) of
$1.60\pm0.07\times10^6$ Msun in excellent agreement with $N$-body simulations.
The metal-poor globular cluster stars contribute about $65\%$ of the total mass
or $1.04\pm0.05\times10^6$ Msun. The metal-rich stars can be further divided
into young and intermediate age populations that contribute
$0.32\pm0.02\times10^6$ Msun ($20\%$) and $0.24\pm0.02\times10^6$ Msun
($15\%$), respectively. Our population-dynamical models successfully
distinguish the different stellar populations in Sgr's nucleus because of their
different spatial distributions, ages, metallicities, and kinematic features.

to form EW binaries in tight orbits. Indeed, the majority of known EWs are

the observed wide orbit of the KIC 8145411 system. The Porb distribution for EW
binaries produced through binary-binary encounters is bimodal: one mode
corresponds to the initial orbital period of the EW binary, while the other is
near Porb about a few 100 days, similar to the orbital period of the KIC

amorphous shell preserves the excellent mechanical strength of the microwire.
This study also provides a new pathway for the design of novel core/shell

follow the time dependent evolution of frequency integrated specific

is done in the lab frame while all the coupling terms are solved in the fluid
rest frame. Lorentz transformation is used to connect different frames.
Radiation transport equation is solved fully implicitly in time while the MHD
equations are evolved explicitly so that time step is not limited by the speed
of light. A finite volume approach is used for transport in both spatial and
frequency spaces to conserve radiation energy density and momentum. The
algorithm includes photon absorption, electron scattering as well as Compton
scattering, which is calculated by solving the Kompaneets equation. The
algorithm is accurate for a wide range of optical depth conditions and can
handle both radiation pressure and gas pressure dominated flows. It works for
both Cartesian and curvilinear coordinate systems with adaptive mesh
refinement. We provide a variety of test problems including radiating sphere,
shadow test, absorption of a moving gas, Bondi type flows as well as a
collection of test problems for thermal and bulk Compton scattering. We also

observed HCN/HNC abundance ratios are lowest, $n \sim 10^{5.5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and
$\zeta \sim 10^{-12}$ s$^{-1}$ (greater than $10^4$ times the average Galactic

CRIR with the number of star formation-related heating sources (supernova
remnants, HII regions, and super hot cores) located in each GMC, as well as a
correlation between CRIRs and supernova rates. Additionally, we see an
anticorrelation between the HCN/HNC ratio and CRIR, indicating that this ratio

(CLEAR) survey. [Ne V] emission probes extremely energetic photoionization
(97.11-126.21 eV), and is often attributed to energetic radiation from active
galactic nuclei (AGN), shocks from supernova, or an otherwise very hard
ionizing spectrum from the stellar continuum. In this work, we use [Ne V] in
conjunction with other rest-frame UV/optical emission lines ([O II]
$\lambda\lambda$3726,3729, [Ne III] $\lambda$3869, H$\beta$, [O III]

and mid-infrared imaging (from Spitzer) to study the origin of this emission
and to place constraints on the nature of the ionizing engine. The majority of
the [Ne V]-detected galaxies have properties consistent with ionization from
AGN. However, for our [Ne V]-selected sample, the X-ray luminosities are
consistent with local ($z\lesssim 0.1$) X-ray-selected Seyferts, but the [Ne V]
luminosities are more consistent with those from $z\sim 1$ X-ray-selected QSOs.
The excess [Ne V] emission requires either reduced hard X-rays, or a $\sim$0.1
keV excess. We discuss possible origins of the apparent [Ne V] excess, which
could be related to the ``soft (X-ray) excess'' observed in some QSOs and
Seyferts, and/or be a consequence of a complex/anisotropic geometry for the
narrow line region, combined with absorption from a warm, relativistic wind
ejected from the accretion disk. We also consider implications for future
studies of extreme high-ionization systems in the epoch of reionization ($z
\gtrsim 6$) with JWST.

Most interestingly, the critical phase comprises of two different mobility
edges that are found to exist between the extended to the localized phase, and
between the critical (multifractal) and localized phases. We perform our
analysis employing the inverse and the normalized participation ratios, fractal

general topological space. Our focus lies on the situation with non-compact
parameter domains, which is, for example, relevant when the commonly used box
constraints are disposed of. To overcome this lack of compactness, we propose a
natural extension of the upper-level functional to the closure of the parameter
domain via Gamma-convergence, which captures possible structural changes in the
reconstruction model at the edge of the domain. Under two main assumptions,
namely, Mosco-convergence of the regularizers and uniqueness of minimizers of
the lower-level problem, we prove that the extension coincides with the
relaxation, thus admitting minimizers that relate to the parameter optimization
problem of interest. We apply our abstract framework to investigate a quartet
of practically relevant models in image denoising, all featuring nonlocality.
The associated families of regularizers exhibit qualitatively different
parameter dependence, describing a weight factor, an amount of nonlocality, an
integrability exponent, and a fractional order, respectively. After the
asymptotic analysis that determines the relaxation in each of the four
settings, we finally establish theoretical conditions on the data that
guarantee structural stability of the models and give examples of when
stability is lost.

problems with existing CAPT methods is the low availability of annotated
mispronounced speech needed for reliable training of pronunciation error
detection models. Therefore, the detection of pronunciation errors is
reformulated to the task of generating synthetic mispronounced speech.
Intuitively, if we could mimic mispronounced speech and produce any amount of

energy flow in nanojunctions, we study phononic heat transport through
metal-molecule-metal junctions using classical molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. Considering a single-molecule gold-alkanedithiol-gold junction, we
first focus on aspects of method development and compare two techniques for
calculating thermal conductance: (i) The Reverse Nonequilibrium MD (RNEMD)
method, where heat is inputted and extracted at a constant rate from opposite
metals. In this case, the thermal conductance is calculated from the
nonequilibrium temperature profile that is created on the junction. (ii) The
Approach-to-Equilibrium MD (AEMD) method, with the thermal conductance of the
junction obtained from the equilibration dynamics of the metals. In both
methods, simulations of alkane chains of growing size display an approximate
length-independence of the thermal conductance, with calculated values matching
computational and experimental studies. The RNEMD and AEMD methods offer
different insights on thermal transport, and we discuss their relative benefits
and shortcomings. Assessing the potential application of molecular junctions as
thermal diodes, the alkane junctions are made spatially asymmetric by modifying
their contact regions with the bulk, either by using distinct endgroups or by
replacing one of the Au contacts by Ag. Anharmonicity is built into the system
within the molecular force-field. Using the RNEMD method, we show that, while
the temperature profile strongly varies (compared to the
gold-alkanedithiol-gold junctions) due to these structural modifications, the
thermal diode effect is inconsequential in these systems -- unless one goes to
very large thermal biases. This finding suggests that one should seek molecules
with considerable internal anharmonic effects for developing nonlinear thermal
devices.

is a replay attack, a natural attack mode when the dynamics of the system is
unknown to the attacker. The paper first generalizes the existing result on the
detection rate of $\chi^2$ detector from a static-LQR controller to a general

throughout the process for both, the target probability estimation and for
updating the biasing distributions. Large deviation theory is used to find a
good initial biasing distribution through the solution of an optimization

is most informative of the rare event probability. This subspace is used for
the cross-entropy method, which is known to lose efficiency in higher

Dunn Solar Telescope, we examine photospheric and chromospheric wave signatures
from a unique collection of magnetic pores originating from the same decaying
sunspot. Wavelet analysis of high cadence photospheric imaging reveals the
ubiquitous presence of slow sausage mode oscillations, coherent across all
photospheric pores through comparisons of intensity and area fluctuations,
producing statistically significant in-phase relationships. The universal
nature of these waves allowed an investigation of whether the wave activity
remained coherent as they propagate. Utilizing bi-sector Doppler velocity
analysis of the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line, alongside comparisons of the modeled
spectral response function, we find fine-scale 5 mHz power amplification as the
waves propagate into the chromosphere. Phase angles approaching zero degrees
between co-spatial bi-sectors spanning different line depths indicate standing
sausage modes following reflection against the transition region boundary.
Fourier analysis of chromospheric velocities between neighboring pores reveals
the annihilation of the wave coherency observed in the photosphere, with
examination of the intensity and velocity signals from individual pores
indicating they behave as fractured wave guides, rather than monolithic
structures. Importantly, this work highlights that wave morphology with
atmospheric height is highly complex, with vast differences observed at
chromospheric layers, despite equivalent wave modes being introduced into
similar pores in the photosphere.

our earlier study, we developed a three-step numerical scheme to connect the

with the microscale kinetic instability energized by the obtained nonthermal
velocity distribution and found that direct and efficient harmonic X-mode (X2
for short) emission can be achieved due to the strip-like features of the
distribution. That study only considered the radiation from the loop top at a
specific time. Here we present the emission properties along the loop at
different locations and timings. We found that, in accordance with our earlier
results, few to several strip-like features can appear in all cases, and the
first two strips play the major role in exciting X2 and Z (i.e., the slow
extraordinary mode) that propagate quasi-perpendicularly. For the four sections
along the loop, significant excitation of X2 is observed from the upper two
sections, and the strongest emission is from the top section. In addition,
significant excitation of Z is observed for all loop sections, while there is
no significant emission of the fundamental X mode. The study provides new
insight into coherent maser emission along the coronal loop structure during

secular tidal forcing by a Keplerian eccentric orbit central binary. The disc
acquires a forced eccentricity whose magnitude depends on the properties of the
binary and disc. The largest eccentricities occur when there is a global
apsidal resonance in the disc. The driving frequency by the binary is its
apsidal frequency that is equal to zero. A global resonance occurs when the
disc properties permit the existence of a zero apsidal frequency free eccentric
mode. Resonances occur for different free eccentric modes that differ in the
number of radial nodes. For a disc not at resonance, the eccentricity
distribution has somewhat similar form to the eccentricity distributions in
discs at resonance that have the closest matching disc aspect ratios. For
higher disc aspect ratios, the forced eccentricity distribution in a 2D disc is
similar to that of the fundamental free mode. The forced eccentricity
distribution in a 3D disc is similar to that of higher order free modes, not
the fundamental mode, unless the disc is very cool. For parameters close to
resonance, large phase shifts occur between the disc and binary eccentricities
that are locked in phase. Forced eccentricity may play an important role in the
evolution of circumbinary discs and their central binaries.

can also act as a mobile recharging stations need to jointly accomplish a
mission such as persistently monitoring a set of points. Due to the limited
battery capacity of the UAVs, they sometimes have to deviate from their task to
rendezvous with the UGVs and get recharged. Each UGV can serve a limited number
of UAVs at a time. In contrast to prior work on deterministic multi-robot
scheduling, we consider the challenge imposed by the stochasticity of the
energy consumption of the UAV. We are interested in finding the optimal
recharging schedule of the UAVs such that the travel cost is minimized and the
probability that no UAV runs out of charge within the planning horizon is
greater than a user-defined tolerance. We formulate this problem ({Risk-aware
Recharging Rendezvous Problem (RRRP))} as an Integer Linear Program (ILP), in
which the matching constraint captures the resource availability constraints
and the knapsack constraint captures the success probability constraints. We
propose a bicriteria approximation algorithm to solve RRRP. We demonstrate the

affected by convective turbulent flows. It has not yet been shown how crucial
convective flows are for the formation of $\delta$-spots. The aim of this study
is to reveal the impact of convective flows in the convection zone on the
formation and evolution of sunspot magnetic fields. We simulated the emergence
and transport of magnetic flux tubes in the convection zone using radiative
magnetohydrodynamics code R2D2. We carried out 93 simulations by allocating the
twisted flux tubes to different positions in the convection zone. As a result,
both $\delta$-type and $\beta$-type magnetic distributions were reproduced only
by the differences in the convective flows surrounding the flux tubes. The
$\delta $-spots were formed by the collision of positive and negative magnetic
fluxes on the photosphere. The unipolar and bipolar rotations of the
$\delta$-spots were driven by magnetic twist and writhe, transporting magnetic
helicity from the convection zone to the corona. We detected a strong
correlation between the distribution of the nonpotential magnetic field in the
photosphere and the position of the downflow plume in the convection zone. The
correlation could be detected $20$-$30$ h before the flux emergence. The
results suggest that high free energy regions in the photosphere can be
predicted even before the magnetic flux appears in the photosphere by detecting
the downflow profile in the convection zone.

datasets in recent years, yet few studies have released their datasets due to
privacy concerns. This poses a challenge in terms of reproducing and validating
published research findings, which is necessary to avoid errors (e.g.,
miscalculations) during the research process.In this work, in order to promote
reproducibility of genome-related research, we propose a novel scheme for
sharing genomic datasets under differential privacy, which consists of two
stages. In the first stage, the scheme generates a noisy copy of the genomic
dataset by conducting the XOR operation between the binarized (encoded) dataset
and binary noises. To preserve the biological features, entries of the noises
are generated by considering the inherent correlation properties of the genomic
data (obtained from publicly available datasets). In the second stage, the
scheme alters the value distribution of each column in the generated copy to
align with the privacy-preserving version (protected by the Laplace mechanism)
of the distribution in the original dataset using optimal transport. We
evaluate the proposed scheme on two real-life genomic datasets from OpenSNP
compared with two existing privacy-preserving techniques, both of which are
winners from NIST challenges. In regard to reproducing findings of the
genome-wide association studies (considering the $\chi^2$ tests and the odd
ratio tests), our scheme can detect even slight errors (e.g., miscalculations)
that may occur during the research process, while other methods cannot even
identify significant errors. Additionally, we indicate via experiments that our
scheme has better data utility and achieves higher protection against
membership inference attacks with lower time complexity.

lies at the essence of secure information flow analysis, binding-time analysis,
etc. Various calculi have been proposed in the literature for analysing
individual dependencies. Abadi et. al., by extending Moggi's monadic
metalanguage, unified several of these calculi into the Dependency Core
Calculus (DCC). DCC has served as a foundational framework for dependency
analysis for the last two decades. However, in spite of its success, DCC has
its limitations. First, the monadic bind rule of the calculus is nonstandard
and relies upon an auxiliary protection judgement. Second, being of a monadic
nature, the calculus cannot capture dependency analyses that possess a
comonadic nature, for example, the binding-time calculus, $\lambda^{\circ}$, of
Davies. In this paper, we address these limitations by designing an alternative
dependency calculus that is inspired by standard ideas from category theory.
Our calculus is both monadic and comonadic in nature and subsumes both DCC and
$\lambda^{\circ}$. Our construction explains the nonstandard bind rule and the
protection judgement of DCC in terms of standard categorical concepts. It also
leads to a novel technique for proving correctness of dependency analysis. We
use this technique to present alternative proofs of correctness for DCC and
$\lambda^{\circ}$.

  Shapes Swarm-Like Behaviors","12 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Popular hypotheses about the origins of collective adaptation are related to
two basic behaviours: protection from predators and a combined search for food
resources. Among the anti-predator explanations, the predator confusion
hypothesis suggests that groups of individuals moving in a swarm aim to
overwhelm the predator while the dilution of risk hypothesis suggests that the
probability of a single prey being targeted by a predator is lower in larger
groups. In this paper, we explore how emergent behaviors arise from a
predator-driven process as an adaptive response to external stimuli perceived
as threatening. Moreover, we suggest a predator confusion process to provide a
selective pressure for the prey to evolve group formations. We analyze the
foraging and prey-predator dynamics evolved in terms of group density and
formation, behavior consistency, predator evasion and success rate, and
foraging rate. Two agents' perceptual models are compared. A local observation
model, where agents can only see what's in their immediate vicinity, and a
global observation model, where agents are able to see the predator at all
times. Both models were evolved for predator avoidance, foraging and collision
avoidance, using reinforcement learning in a simulated game environment. Our
results suggest that the dilution of risk factor is sufficient to evolve group
formations, and the predator confusion effect could play an important role in
the evolution of collaborative behaviors. Finally, we show how variations in
the information exchange of this social order can impact the global collective
behaviors.

decide whether to join the platform (and truthfully reveal their data) or not
participate by considering both the privacy costs of joining and the benefit
they get from obtaining the statistic. The platform must ensure the statistic

add to the computation, but can also induce personalized privacy levels (or
costs) by giving different weights to different agents in the computation as a

robust and distributionally robust optimization. To account for variability in
daily solar generation, we propose a data-driven robust optimization approach
that prevents excessive conservatism by averaging across uncertainty sets. To
protect against variability in seasonal weather patterns induced by climate
change, we invoke distributionally robust optimization techniques. Under a ten
billion MAD (approx. one billion USD) investment by OCP, the proposed
methodology reduces the carbon emissions which arise from OCP's energy needs by
more than 60% while lowering its time-adjusted operational costs over 20 years
by approximately 80% (28 billion MAD). The proposed investment and operational
strategies are robust to perturbations in the data, guaranteeing that the

low-dimensional model based on a randomly driven Rayleigh oscillator with
coefficients experiencing random fluctuations. The model considers kink
oscillations as natural modes of coronal loops, decaying by linear resonant
absorption. The damping is counteracted by random motions of the loop
footpoints and the interaction of the loop with external quasi-steady flows
with random fluctuations. In other words, the model combines the
self-oscillatory and randomly driven mechanisms for the decayless behaviour.
The random signals are taken to be of the stationary red noise nature. In the
noiseless case, the model has an asymptotically stationary oscillatory
solution, i.e., a kink self-oscillation. It is established that the kink
oscillation period is practically independent of noise. This finding justifies
the seismological estimations of the kink and Alfv\'en speeds and the magnetic
field in an oscillating loop by kink oscillations, based on the observed
oscillation period. The oscillatory patterns are found to be almost harmonic.
Noisy fluctuations of external flows modulate the amplitude of the almost
monochromatic oscillatory pattern symmetrically, while random motions of the
loop footpoints cause antisymmetric amplitude modulation. Such modulations are
also consistent with the observed behaviour.

interpretation of solid-state photoexcited dynamics, however, is complicated by
the core-hole perturbation and the resulting many-body dynamics. Here, an ab
initio, Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approach is developed that can
incorporate photoexcited state effects for solid-state materials. The extreme
ultraviolet (XUV) absorption spectra for the ground, photoexcited, and
thermally expanded states of first row transition metal oxides - $TiO_2,
\alpha-Cr_2O_3, \beta-MnO_2, \alpha-Fe_2O_3, Co_3O_4, NiO, CuO, and ZnO$ - are
calculated to demonstrate the accuracy of this approach. The theory is used to
decompose the core-valence excitons into the separate components of the X-ray
transition Hamiltonian for each of the transition metal oxides investigated.
The decomposition provides a physical intuition about the origins of XUV
spectral features as well as how the spectra will change following
photoexcitation. The method is easily generalized to other K, L, M, and N edges
to provide a general approach for analyzing transient X-ray absorption or
reflection data.

country scale, the epidemic has undergone a fairly well-known and
distinguishable initial phase, reaching its peak on mid July 2020. However, the
detailed picture is more involved and reflects inter-regional variations in the
epidemic dynamics, presumably grounded on socio-demographic, connectivity, and
human mobility factors. Classifying the regional epidemic curves and
identifying the major hubs of regional COVID-19 spread can contribute towards
defining an evidence-based risk map for future outbreaks of infectious diseases
with similar transmissibility properties. In this work, we make a regional wave
decomposition of the initial epidemic phase registered in Guatemala, and we use
the Richards phenomenological model alongside multivariate ordination
techniques of its estimated model parameters to draw a countrywide picture of
the first epidemiological wave. By exploring similarities in the model space
parameters, we traced routes for the disease spread across the country. We
evaluated how well the proposed classification can help to define a regional
risk hierarchy comprising early stage focal points, major hubs, and secondary
regions of epidemic progression.

software instrument to compute an extensive main-sequence grid of stellar
structure and evolution models, as well as isochrones, accounting for the
effects attributed to a surface fossil magnetic field. The grid is densely
populated in initial mass (3-60 M$_\odot$), surface equatorial magnetic field
strength (0-50 kG), and metallicity (representative of the Solar neighbourhood
and the Magellanic Clouds). We use two magnetic braking and two chemical mixing
schemes and compare the model predictions for slowly-rotating,
nitrogen-enriched (""Group 2"") stars with observations in the Large Magellanic
Cloud. We quantify a range of initial field strengths that allow for producing
Group 2 stars and find that typical values (up to a few kG) lead to solutions.
Between the subgrids, we find notable departures in surface abundances and
evolutionary paths. In our magnetic models, chemical mixing is always less
efficient compared to non-magnetic models due to the rapid spin-down. We
identify that quasi-chemically homogeneous main sequence evolution by efficient
mixing could be prevented by fossil magnetic fields. We recommend comparing
this grid of evolutionary models with spectropolarimetric and spectroscopic
observations with the goals of i) revisiting the derived stellar parameters of
known magnetic stars, and ii) observationally constraining the uncertain

  Construction","Accepted by European Conference on Computer Vision 2022 (ECCV2022)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-supervised depth learning from monocular images normally relies on the
2D pixel-wise photometric relation between temporally adjacent image frames.
However, they neither fully exploit the 3D point-wise geometric
correspondences, nor effectively tackle the ambiguities in the photometric
warping caused by occlusions or illumination inconsistency. To address these
problems, this work proposes Density Volume Construction Network (DevNet), a
novel self-supervised monocular depth learning framework, that can consider 3D
spatial information, and exploit stronger geometric constraints among adjacent
camera frustums. Instead of directly regressing the pixel value from a single
image, our DevNet divides the camera frustum into multiple parallel planes and
predicts the pointwise occlusion probability density on each plane. The final
depth map is generated by integrating the density along corresponding rays.
During the training process, novel regularization strategies and loss functions
are introduced to mitigate photometric ambiguities and overfitting. Without
obviously enlarging model parameters size or running time, DevNet outperforms
several representative baselines on both the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset and
NYU-V2 indoor dataset. In particular, the root-mean-square-deviation is reduced
by around 4% with DevNet on both KITTI-2015 and NYU-V2 in the task of depth
estimation. Code is available at https://github.com/gitkaichenzhou/DevNet.

Neural Networks (GNN), it is common to combine several small graphs into one
overall graph to accelerate processing and remove or reduce the overhead of
padding. This is for example supported in the PyG library. However, the sizes
of small graphs can vary substantially with respect to the number of nodes and
edges, and hence the size of the combined graph can still vary considerably,
especially for small batch sizes. Therefore, the costs of excessive padding and
wasted compute are still incurred when working with static shapes, which are
preferred for maximum acceleration. This paper proposes a new hardware agnostic
approach -- tuple packing -- for generating batches that cause minimal
overhead. The algorithm extends recently introduced sequence packing approaches
to work on the 2D tuples of (|nodes|, |edges|). A monotone heuristic is applied
to the 2D histogram of tuple values to define a priority for packing histogram
bins together with the objective to reach a limit on the number of nodes as

action pairs have equivalent reward and transition dynamics. On the other hand,
modern reinforcement learning systems must painstakingly learn through trial
and error that sets of state action pairs are value equivalent -- requiring an
often prohibitively large amount of samples from their environment. MDP
homomorphisms have been proposed that reduce the observed MDP of an environment
to an abstract MDP, which can enable more sample efficient policy learning.
Consequently, impressive improvements in sample efficiency have been achieved
when a suitable MDP homomorphism can be constructed a priori -- usually by
exploiting a practioner's knowledge of environment symmetries. We propose a
novel approach to constructing a homomorphism in discrete action spaces, which
uses a partial model of environment dynamics to infer which state action pairs
lead to the same state -- reducing the size of the state-action space by a
factor equal to the cardinality of the action space. We call this method
equivalent effect abstraction. In a gridworld setting, we demonstrate
empirically that equivalent effect abstraction can improve sample efficiency in
a model-free setting and planning efficiency for modelbased approaches.
Furthermore, we show on cartpole that our approach outperforms an existing
method for learning homomorphisms, while using 33x less training data.

wide variation in the number of utterances used for each system on the

goals and enables predictions under interventions. With the growing importance
of learning causal relationships, causal discovery tasks have transitioned from
using traditional methods to infer potential causal structures from
observational data to the field of pattern recognition involved in deep
learning. The rapid accumulation of massive data promotes the emergence of
causal search methods with brilliant scalability. Existing summaries of causal
discovery methods mainly focus on traditional methods based on constraints,
scores and FCMs, there is a lack of perfect sorting and elaboration for deep
learning-based methods, also lacking some considers and exploration of causal
discovery methods from the perspective of variable paradigms. Therefore, we
divide the possible causal discovery tasks into three types according to the
variable paradigm and give the definitions of the three tasks respectively,
define and instantiate the relevant datasets for each task and the final causal
model constructed at the same time, then reviews the main existing causal
discovery methods for different tasks. Finally, we propose some roadmaps from
different perspectives for the current research gaps in the field of causal
discovery and point out future research directions.

  embedding theory: Non-equilibrium electron dynamics in extended systems",,,"10.1063/5.0146973",,"cond-mat.str-el physics.chem-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this work, we derive a multi-fragment real-time extension of projected
density matrix embedding theory (pDMET) designed to treat non-equilibrium
electron dynamics in strongly correlated systems. As in the previously
developed static pDMET, real-time pDMET partitions the total system into many
fragments; the coupling between each fragment and the rest of the system is
treated through a compact representation of the environment in terms of a
quantum bath. Real-time pDMET involves simultaneously propagating the
wavefunctions for each separate fragment-bath embedding system along with an
auxiliary mean-field wavefunction of the total system. The equations of motion
are derived by (i) projecting the time-dependent Schrodinger equation in the
fragment and bath space associated with each separate fragment and by (ii)
enforcing the pDMET matching conditions between the global 1-particle reduced
density matrix (1-RDM) obtained from the fragment calculations and the
mean-field 1-RDM at all points in time. The accuracy of the method is
benchmarked through comparisons to the time-dependent density-matrix
renormalization group (TD-DMRG) and time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory;
the methods were applied to a single-impurity Anderson model and multi-impurity
Anderson models with ordered and disordered distributions of the impurities.
The results demonstrate a large improvement over TDHF and rapid convergence to
the exact dynamics with an increase in fragment size. Our results demonstrate
that real-time pDMET is a promising and flexible method to simulate
non-equilibrium electron dynamics in heterogeneous systems of large size.

(TBs) has limitations in normal tissue sparing. The single-energy spread-out
Bragg peaks (SESOBPs) of FLASH dose rate have been demonstrated feasible for
proton FLASH planning. A hybrid inverse optimization method was developed to
combine the TBs and SESOBPs (TB-SESOBP) for FLASH planning. The SESOBPs were
generated from spreading out the BPs by pre-designed general bar ridge filters
and placed at the central target by range shifters to obtain a uniform dose
within the target. The SESOBPs and TBs were fully sampled field-by-field
allowing automatic spot selection and weighting in the optimization process.
The TB-SESOBP plans were validated in comparison with the TB only (TB-only)
plans and the plans with the combination of TBs and BPs (TB-BP) regarding 3D
dose and dose rate distributions for five lung cases. Comparing to the TB-only
plans, the mean spinal cord D1.2cc drastically reduced 41%, the mean lung V7Gy
and V7.4Gy moderately reduced by up to 17% and the target dose homogeneity
slightly increased in the TB-SESOBP plans. Comparable dose homogeneity was
achieved in both TB-SESOBP and TB-BP plans. Besides, prominent improvements
were achieved in lung sparing for the cases of relatively large targets by the
TB-SESOBP plans comparing to the TB-BP plans. The targets were fully covered
with the FLASH dose rate in all the three plans. For the OARs, V40Gy/s = 100%
was achieved by the TB-only plans while V40Gy/s > 85% was obtained by the other
two plans. We have demonstrated that the hybrid TB-SESOBP planning was feasible
to achieve FLASH dose rate for proton therapy. The hybrid TB-SESOBP planning
has great potential in improving OAR sparing while maintaining high target dose
homogeneity, and can be potentially implemented for adaptive radiotherapy.

decency of these models, recent works have shown that MLP-based models are able
to achieve comparable results on various tasks ranging from computer vision,
NLP to 3D point cloud, while achieving higher throughput due to the parallelism

Based on our analysis, two major issues account for the accuracy gap: 1) the
range of activations in MLP-based models can be too large to quantize, and 2)
specific components in the MLP-based models are sensitive to quantization.
Consequently, we propose to 1) apply LayerNorm to control the quantization
range of activations, 2) utilize bounded activation functions, 3) apply

droplet walking on the free surface of a vertically vibrating liquid bath, with
the droplet's horizontal walking motion guided by its self-generated wave
field. These self-propelled WPEs have been shown to exhibit analogs of several
quantum and optical phenomena. Using an idealized theoretical model that takes
the form of a Lorenz-like system, we theoretically and numerically explore the
dynamics of such a one-dimensional WPE in a sinusoidal potential. We find
steady states of the system that correspond to a stationary WPE as well as a
rich array of unsteady motions such as back-and-forth oscillating walkers,
runaway oscillating walkers and various types of irregular walkers. In the
parameter space formed by the dimensionless parameters of the applied
sinusoidal potential, we observe patterns of alternating unsteady behaviors
suggesting interference effects. Additionally, in certain regions of the
parameter space, we also identify multistability in the particle's long-term
behavior that depends on the initial conditions. We make analogies between the
identified behaviors in the WPE system and Bragg's reflection of light as well
as electron motion in crystals.

Although the existing gradient-based attacks achieve state-of-the-art
performance in feed-forward NNs and image recognition tasks, they do not
perform as well on time series classification with recurrent neural network
(RNN) models. This is because the cyclical structure of RNN prevents direct
model differentiation and the visual sensitivity of time series data to
perturbations challenges the traditional local optimization objective of the
adversarial attack. In this paper, a black-box method called TSFool is proposed
to efficiently craft highly-imperceptible adversarial time series for RNN
classifiers. We propose a novel global optimization objective named Camouflage
Coefficient to consider the imperceptibility of adversarial samples from the
perspective of class distribution, and accordingly refine the adversarial
attack as a multi-objective optimization problem to enhance the perturbation
quality. To get rid of the dependence on gradient information, we also propose
a new idea that introduces a representation model for RNN to capture deeply
embedded vulnerable samples having otherness between their features and latent
manifold, based on which the optimization solution can be heuristically
approximated. Experiments on 10 UCR datasets are conducted to confirm that
TSFool averagely outperforms existing methods with a 46.3% higher attack

efficiently solved by a new two-phase approach. Its key idea is to first
optimize the inner passive-IRS beam routing between each two active IRSs for
effective channel power gain maximization, followed by an outer active-IRS beam

seek a BNE in a non-compact set and convey such complex strategies in network

continuous model with an explicit error bound. The other one is a communication
step, where we adopt a novel compression scheme with a designed sparsification

provides essential context to the device activation points. By doing so, a
hierarchical pathway is followed for detecting active devices in a grant-free

  Object Tracking",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning robust feature matching between the template and search area is
crucial for 3D Siamese tracking. The core of Siamese feature matching is how to
assign high feature similarity on the corresponding points between the template
and search area for precise object localization. In this paper, we propose a
novel point cloud registration-driven Siamese tracking framework, with the
intuition that spatially aligned corresponding points (via 3D registration)
tend to achieve consistent feature representations. Specifically, our method
consists of two modules, including a tracking-specific nonlocal registration
module and a registration-aided Sinkhorn template-feature aggregation module.
The registration module targets at the precise spatial alignment between the
template and search area. The tracking-specific spatial distance constraint is
proposed to refine the cross-attention weights in the nonlocal module for
discriminative feature learning. Then, we use the weighted SVD to compute the
rigid transformation between the template and search area, and align them to
achieve the desired spatially aligned corresponding points. For the feature
aggregation model, we formulate the feature matching between the transformed
template and search area as an optimal transport problem and utilize the
Sinkhorn optimization to search for the outlier-robust matching solution. Also,
a registration-aided spatial distance map is built to improve the matching
robustness in indistinguishable regions (e.g., smooth surface). Finally, guided
by the obtained feature matching map, we aggregate the target information from
the template into the search area to construct the target-specific feature,
which is then fed into a CenterPoint-like detection head for object
localization. Extensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes and Waymo datasets
verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

adapts to the data-dependent requirements of brightness enhancement and
improves the visibility of details without losing the global contrast. This
method incorporates the spatial information provided by image context in
density estimation for discriminative histogram equalization. To minimize the
adverse effect of non-uniform illumination, we propose defining spatial
information on the basis of image reflectance estimated with edge preserving
smoothing. Our method works particularly well for determining how the
background brightness should be adaptively adjusted and for revealing useful
image details hidden in the dark.

intensity occurrence (1D histogram) by marginalizing over the distribution of
intensity co-occurrence (2D histogram). This scheme improves global contrast
more effectively and reduces noise amplification. The 2D histogram is defined
by incorporating the local pixel value differences in image reflectance into
the density estimation to alleviate the adverse effects of dark lighting

originating from distinct geographic regions and covering various scenarios. As
a result, 3D detectors tend to overfit the datasets they are trained on. This
causes a drastic decrease in accuracy when the detectors are trained on one

form a large component of this reduction in performance. We address this in our
approach, SEE-VCN, by designing a novel viewer-centred surface completion

unsupervised domain adaptation framework, SEE. With SEE-VCN, we obtain a
unified representation of objects across datasets, allowing the network to
focus on learning geometry, rather than overfitting on scan patterns. By
adopting a domain-invariant representation, SEE-VCN can be classed as a
multi-target domain adaptation approach where no annotations or re-training is
required to obtain 3D detections for new scan patterns. Through extensive
experiments, we show that our approach outperforms previous domain adaptation

Attempts at mitigating the repetitive manual process of TF design have led to
approaches that make use of a knowledge database consisting of pre-designed TFs
by domain experts. In these approaches, a user navigates the knowledge database
to find the most suitable pre-designed TF for their input volume to visualize
the SOIs. Although these approaches potentially reduce the workload to generate
the TFs, they, however, require manual TF navigation of the knowledge database,
as well as the likely fine tuning of the selected TF to suit the input. In this
work, we propose a TF design approach where we introduce a new content-based

pre-designed TFs, our knowledge database contains image volumes with SOI
labels. Given an input image volume, our CBR approach retrieves relevant image
volumes (with SOI labels) from the knowledge database; the retrieved labels are
then used to generate and optimize TFs of the input. This approach does not
need any manual TF navigation and fine tuning. For improving SOI retrieval
performance, we propose a two-stage CBR scheme to enable the use of local

minimally-invasive surgical tasks using a unified set of motion primitives
(MPs) to enable more objective labeling and the aggregation of different
datasets.
  Methods: We model dry-lab surgical tasks as finite state machines,
representing how the execution of MPs as the basic surgical actions results in
the change of surgical context, which characterizes the physical interactions
among tools and objects in the surgical environment. We develop methods for
labeling surgical context based on video data and for automatic translation of
context to MP labels. We then use our framework to create the COntext and
Motion Primitive Aggregate Surgical Set (COMPASS), including six dry-lab
surgical tasks from three publicly-available datasets (JIGSAWS, DESK, and
ROSMA), with kinematic and video data and context and MP labels.
  Results: Our context labeling method achieves near-perfect agreement between
consensus labels from crowd-sourcing and expert surgeons. Segmentation of tasks
to MPs results in the creation of the COMPASS dataset that nearly triples the
amount of data for modeling and analysis and enables the generation of separate
transcripts for the left and right tools.
  Conclusion: The proposed framework results in high quality labeling of
surgical data based on context and fine-grained MPs. Modeling surgical tasks

as a criterion for controller design. In the regret-optimal control paradigm,
causal controllers are designed to minimize regret against a hypothetical
optimal noncausal controller, which selects the globally cost-minimizing
sequence of control actions given noncausal access to the disturbance sequence.
  We extend regret-optimal control to the more challenging measurement-feedback
setting, where the online controller must compete against the optimal noncausal
controller without directly observing the state or the driving disturbance. We
show that no measurement-feedback controller can have bounded competitive ratio
or regret which is bounded by the pathlength of the measurement disturbance. We
do derive, however, a controller whose regret has optimal dependence on the
joint energy of the driving and measurement disturbances, and another
controller whose regret has optimal dependence on the pathlength of the driving
disturbance and the energy of the measurement disturbance. The key technique we
introduce is a reduction from regret-optimal measurement-feedback control to
$H_{\infty}$-optimal measurement-feedback control in a synthetic system. We
present numerical simulations which illustrate the efficacy of our proposed
control algorithms.

multi-dimensional analog signals. Building on top of the Unlimited Sensing
Framework (USF), we present a new folded sampling operator called the

existing one-dimensional modulo operator. Unlike previous approaches, the
proposed model is specifically tailored to multi-dimensional signals. In
particular, the model uses certain redundancy in dimensions 2 and above, which
is exploited for input recovery with robustness. We prove that the new operator
is well-defined and its outputs have a bounded dynamic range. For the noiseless
case, we derive a theoretically guaranteed input reconstruction approach. When
the input is corrupted by Gaussian noise, we exploit redundancy in higher
dimensions to provide a bound on the error probability and show this drops to 0
for high enough sampling rates leading to new theoretical guarantees for the
noisy case. Our numerical examples corroborate the theoretical results and show
that the proposed approach can handle a significantly larger amount of noise

Network (GAN) is adapted to generate the feasible LT trajectory data
efficiently. The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator, both of which
are deep networks. The generator generates fake LT transfer features using
random noise as input, while the discriminator distinguishes the generator's
fake LT transfer features from real LT transfer features. The GAN is trained
until the generator generates fake LT transfers that the discriminator cannot
identify. This indicates the generator generates low thrust transfer features
that have the same distribution as the real transfer features. The generated
low thrust transfer data have a high convergence rate, and they can be used to
efficiently produce training data for deep learning models. The proposed

closely relates to the successful quality inspection of electronics. To provide
accurate remaining useful life (RUL) estimation for reed relay, a hybrid deep
learning network with degradation pattern clustering is proposed based on the
following three considerations. First, multiple degradation behaviors are
observed for reed relay, and hence a dynamic time wrapping-based $K$-means
clustering is offered to distinguish degradation patterns from each other.
Second, although proper selections of features are of great significance, few
studies are available to guide the selection. The proposed method recommends
operational rules for easy implementation purposes. Third, a neural network for
remaining useful life estimation (RULNet) is proposed to address the weakness
of the convolutional neural network (CNN) in capturing temporal information of
sequential data, which incorporates temporal correlation ability after
high-level feature representation of convolutional operation. In this way,
three variants of RULNet are constructed with health indicators, features with
self-organizing map, or features with curve fitting. Ultimately, the proposed
hybrid model is compared with the typical baseline models, including CNN and
long short-term memory network (LSTM), through a practical reed relay dataset
with two distinct degradation manners. The results from both degradation cases
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms CNN and LSTM regarding the
index root mean squared error.

high accuracy. Based on this finding, we do not use the MIL framework, but
instead propose a lightweight model with a self-attention mechanism to
automatically extract features that are important for determining
normal/abnormal from all input segments. As a result, our neural network model

investigate the fast photometric variability of the optical counterparts to
Be/X-ray binaries and compare the general patterns of such variability with the
Galactic population of classical Be stars. We analyzed 21 sources with TESS.
High-cadence photometry with two ground-based telescopes was also performed for
15 sources. Standard Fourier analysis and least-squares fitting methods were
employed in the frequency analysis. All sources exhibit intra-night light
variations with intensity variations of 0.01-0.06 mag in the ground-based
observations and up to 5% in flux in TESS observations. This variability
manifests itself as multi-periodic signals in the frequency range 0.2-12
d$^{-1}$. We find that the patterns of variability of the Be stars in Be/X-ray
binaries agree with that of classical early-type Be stars in terms of the
general shape of the periodograms. Based on the general shape and number of
peaks in the periodograms, Be/X-ray binaries can be classified into different
types. The most common case is the presence of groups of closely-spaced
frequencies (67%), followed by sources that exhibit isolated signals (18%). The
remaining type of sources displays frequency spectra characterized by a mixed
pattern of stochastic variability and high-frequency peaks. This study reveals
that short-term optical photometric variability is a very common, if not
ubiquitous, feature intrinsic to the Be optical companions in Be/X-ray

  submillimeter lines in galaxies","Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters","A&A 666, L3 (2022)","10.1051/0004-6361/202244700",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  H_2O submillimeter emission is a powerful diagnostic of the molecular
interstellar medium in a variety of sources, including low- and high-mass star
forming regions of the Milky Way, and from local to high redshift galaxies.
However, the excitation mechanism of these lines in galaxies has been debated,
preventing a basic consensus on the physical information that H_2O provides.
Both radiative pumping due to H_2O absorption of far-infrared photons emitted
by dust and collisional excitation in dense shocked gas have been proposed to
explain the H_2O emission. Here we propose two basic diagnostics to distinguish
between the two mechanisms: 1) in shock excited regions, the ortho-H_2O
3_{21}-2_{12} 75um and the para-H_2O 2_{20}-1_{11} 101um rotational lines are
expected to be in emission while, if radiative pumping dominates, both
far-infrared lines are expected to be in absorption; 2) based on statistical
equilibrium of H_2O level populations, the radiative pumping scenario predicts
that the apparent isotropic net rate of far-infrared absorption in the
3_{21}-2_{12} (75um) and 2_{20}-1_{11} (101um) lines should be higher than or
equal to the apparent isotropic net rate of submillimeter emission in the
3_{21}-3_{12} (1163 GHz) and 2_20-2_{11} (1229 GHz) lines, respectively.
Applying both criteria to all 16 galaxies and several galactic high-mass
star-forming regions where the H_2O 75um and submillimeter lines have been
observed with Herschel/PACS and SPIRE, we show that in most (extra)galactic
sources the H_2O submillimeter line excitation is dominated by far-infrared
pumping, with collisional excitation of the low-excitation levels in some of
them. Based on this finding, we revisit the interpretation of the correlation
between the luminosity of the H_2O 988 GHz line and the source luminosity in
the combined galactic and extragalactic sample.

(1-D CNN)-based timing synchronization (TS) method is proposed to reduce the

orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Specifically, the TS
task is first transformed into a deep learning (DL)-based classification task,
and then three iterations of the compressed sensing (CS)-based TS strategy are
simplified to form a lightweight network, whose CNN layers are specially
designed to highlight the classification features. Besides, to enhance the
generalization performance of the proposed method against the channel impulse
responses (CIR) uncertainty, the relaxed restriction for propagation delay is
exploited to augment the completeness of training data. Numerical results
reflect that the proposed 1-D CNN-based TS method effectively improves the TS
accuracy, reduces the computational complexity and processing delay, and
possesses a good generalization performance against the CIR uncertainty. The

debate. The main source of controversy is rooted in its indirect nature; the

element analysis to map the conditions (jaws geometry and material properties)
that result in the nucleation of a centre crack. Unlike previous studies, we do
not restrict ourselves to evaluating the stress state at the disk centre; the
failure envelope of the generalised Griffith criterion is used to establish the
crack nucleation location. We find that the range of conditions where the
Brazilian test is valid is much narrower than previously assumed, with current
practices and standards being inappropriate for a wide range of rock-like
materials. The results obtained are used to develop a protocol that
experimentalists can follow to obtain a valid estimate of the material tensile
strength. This is showcased with specific case studies and examples of valid

is facilitated by providing a MATLAB App that determines the validity of the

Consequently, gravitational waves follow slightly different frequency- and
polarization-dependent trajectories. We study the potential for detection of
the gravitational spin Hall effect in hierarchical triple black hole systems,
consisting of an emitting binary orbiting a more massive body, acting as a
gravitational lens. We calculate the difference in time of arrival with respect

dependence on frequency with a fixed exponent. We calculate the gravitational
spin Hall-corrected waveform and its mismatch with respect to the original
waveform. The waveform carries a measurable imprint of the strong gravitational
field if the source, lens and observer are sufficiently aligned or for generic
observers if the source is close enough to the lens. We demonstrate that the

the framework, such as generating stress-strain curves in cyclic loading,
material heterogeneity, performance comparison with other physics-informed
methods, and simulation/inference on unstructured meshes. In all cases, the DEM

fluid flow simulations on 2D triangular and quadrangular meshes and 3D

finite volume scheme that we use for the full Euler equations is based on a
staggered discretization: the density unknowns are associated with a primal
mesh, whereas the velocity unknowns are associated with a ""fictive"" dual mesh.
Accordingly, the convection operator of the mass balance equation is derived on
the primal mesh, while the the convection operator of the momentum balance
equation is discretized on the dual mesh. To avoid any hazardous interpolation
of the unknowns on a possibly ill-defined dual mesh, the mass fluxes of the
momentum convection operator are computed from the mass fluxes of the mass
balance equation, so as to ensure the stability of the resulting operator. A
coherent reconstruction of these dual fluxes is possible, based only on the
kind of considered polygonal or polyhedral cell, and not on each cell itself.
Moreover, we show that this process still yields a consistent convection
operator in the Lax-Wendroff sense, that is, if a sequence of piecewise
constant functions is supposed to converge to a a given limit, then the weak
form of the corresponding discrete convection operator converges to the weak
form of the continuous operator applied to this limit. The derived discrete
convection operator applies to both constant and variable density flows and may
thus be implemented in a scheme for incompressible or compressible flows.
Numerical tests are performed for the Euler equations on several types of mesh,
including hybrid meshes, and show the excellent performance of the method.

considering cross-sentence, embedded structure in training. Three sub-modules,
including linguistics-aware, prosody-aware and sentence-position networks, are
trained together with a modified Tacotron2. Specifically, to learn the
information embedded in a paragraph and the relations among the corresponding
component sentences, we utilize linguistics-aware and prosody-aware networks.
The information in a paragraph is captured by encoders and the inter-sentence
information in a paragraph is learned with multi-head attention mechanisms. The
relative sentence position in a paragraph is explicitly exploited by a
sentence-position network. Trained on a storytelling audio-book corpus (4.08
hours), recorded by a female Mandarin Chinese speaker, the proposed TTS model
demonstrates that it can produce rather natural and good-quality speech
paragraph-wise. The cross-sentence contextual information, such as break and
prosodic variations between consecutive sentences, can be better predicted and
rendered than the sentence-based model. Tested on paragraph texts, of which the
lengths are similar to, longer than, or much longer than the typical paragraph
length of the training data, the TTS speech produced by the new model is
consistently preferred over the sentence-based model in subjective tests and

generated in a particular way that coincides with the large-scale structure.
Notably, one specific flow morphology, which is spiraling inward and
compressing in the third direction, concentrates around halos. A detailed
examination that reveals a sharp change in the logarithmic derivative of its
volume fraction, coincides with the location of the splashback radius defined
as the outermost caustic structure. Such a feature encodes valuable phase space
information and provides a new perspective on understanding the dynamical
evolution of halos. As a volume-weighted quantity, the profile of flow
morphology is purely kinematic. And unlike other related studies, the
rotational flow morphologies capture the anisotropic phase structure in the

restricting the light propagation to periodic patterns. The corresponding

second heavy-metal material. The fact that chiral antiferromagnets produce spin
current inspires us to explore the magnetization switching of chiral spins
using self-generated spin torque. Here, we demonstrate the electric switching
of noncollinear antiferromagnetic state in Mn3Sn by observing a crossover from
conventional spin-orbit torque to the self-generated spin torque when
increasing the MgO thickness in Ta/MgO/Mn3Sn polycrystalline films. The spin
current injection from the Ta layer can be controlled and even blocked by
varying the MgO thickness, but the switching sustains even at a large MgO
thickness. Furthermore, the switching polarity reverses when the MgO thickness
exceeds around 3 nm, which cannot be explained by the spin-orbit torque
scenario due to spin current injection from the Ta layer. Evident
current-induced switching is also observed in MgO/Mn3Sn and Ti/Mn3Sn bilayers,
where external injection of spin Hall current to Mn3Sn is negligible. The
inter-grain spin-transfer torque induced by spin-polarized current explains the
experimental observations. Our findings provide an alternative pathway for
electrical manipulation of non-collinear antiferromagnetic state without

respect to invariant traces is automatic in many cases of interest. This is the
case, for instance, for every action of an amenable group $G$ on a classifiable
$C^*$-algebra $A$ whose trace space $T(A)$ is a Bauer simplex with finite
dimensional boundary $\partial_e T(A)$, and such that the induced action
$G\curvearrowright \partial_eT(A)$ is free. If $G = \mathbb{Z}^d$ and the
action $G\curvearrowright \partial_eT(A)$ is free and minimal, then we obtain
McDuffness with respect to invariant traces, and thus $\mathcal{Z}$-stability
of the corresponding crossed product, also in case $\partial_e T(A)$ has
infinite covering dimension.

combination of SDO/AIA (0--1.3 Rsun), PROBA2/SWAP (0--1.7 Rsun) and MLSO/K-Cor

the CME white-light bright core and EUV blob. In the end, we explore the origin
of various radio bursts closely related to the interaction of the CME
overexpansion with nearby streamer. Results. An interesting finding is that the
height increases of both the CME leading front and bright core are dominated by
the overexpansion during the CME formation. The aspect ratios of the CME bubble
and bright core, quantifying the overexpansion, are found to decrease as the
SO/STIX 4--10 keV and GOES 1--8 A soft X-ray flux of the associated flare
increases near the peaks, indicating an important role of the flare
reconnection in the first overexpansion. The CME bubble even takes place a
second overexpansion although relatively weak, which is closely related to the
compression with a nearby streamer and likely arises from an ideal MHD process.
Moreover, the CME EUV blob is found to be relatively lower and wider than the
CME white-light bright core, may correspond to the bottom part of the growing
CME flux rope. The interaction between the CME and the streamer leads to two
type II radio bursts, one normally drifting and one stationary, which are
speculated to be induced at two different sources of the CME-driven shock
front. The bidirectional electrons evidenced by series of ""C-shaped"" type III
bursts suggest that the interchange reconnection be also involved during the
interaction of the CME and streamer.

The system consists of repelling magnetic masses with grounding stiffness
controlled by electrical coils driven with electrical signals that vary
periodically in time. For small amplitude excitation, in agreement with
theoretical predictions, wavenumber bandgaps emerge. The underlying
instabilities associated to the wavenumber bandgaps are investigated with
Floquet theory and the resulting parametric amplification is observed in both
theory and experiments. In contrast to genuinely linear systems, large
amplitude responses are stabilized via the nonlinear nature of the magnetic
interactions of the system. In particular, the parametric amplification induced
by the wavenumber bandgap can lead to bounded and stable responses that are
temporally quasi-periodic. Controlling the propagation of acoustic and elastic
waves by balancing nonlinearity and external modulation offers a new dimension
in the realization of advanced signal processing and telecommunication devices.

industrial innovation in several relevant application domains. Graph neural
networks (GNNs) are often the core component of the forecasting architecture.
However, in most spatiotemporal GNNs, the computational complexity scales up to
a quadratic factor with the length of the sequence times the number of links in
the graph, hence hindering the application of these models to large graphs and
long temporal sequences. While methods to improve scalability have been
proposed in the context of static graphs, few research efforts have been
devoted to the spatiotemporal case. To fill this gap, we propose a scalable
architecture that exploits an efficient encoding of both temporal and spatial
dynamics. In particular, we use a randomized recurrent neural network to embed
the history of the input time series into high-dimensional state
representations encompassing multi-scale temporal dynamics. Such
representations are then propagated along the spatial dimension using different
powers of the graph adjacency matrix to generate node embeddings characterized
by a rich pool of spatiotemporal features. The resulting node embeddings can be
efficiently pre-computed in an unsupervised manner, before being fed to a
feed-forward decoder that learns to map the multi-scale spatiotemporal
representations to predictions. The training procedure can then be parallelized
node-wise by sampling the node embeddings without breaking any dependency, thus
enabling scalability to large networks. Empirical results on relevant datasets
show that our approach achieves results competitive with the state of the art,
while dramatically reducing the computational burden.

out-of-equilibrium conditions, when the global system evolves unitarily after a
soft quench of the coupling between S and E. When S develops quantum critical
correlations in the weak-coupling regime, the associated scaling behavior
crucially depends on the quantum state of E whether it is characterized by
short-range correlations (analogous to those characterizing disordered phases

resistive MHD simulations of thin $\alpha$-discs, varying the parameters such
as the stellar rotation rate and magnetic field, and (anomalous) coefficients
of viscosity and resistivity in the disc. To provide a benchmark for the
results and to compare with known analytic results, we also perform purely
hydrodynamic simulations (HD) for the same problem. Although obtained for a
different situation with differing inner boundary condition, the disc structure
in the HD simulations closely follows the analytic solution of Klu\'zniak and
Kita (2000) -- in particular a region of ""midplane"" backflow exists in the
right range of radii, depending on the viscosity parameter. In the MHD
solutions, whenever the magnetic Prandtl number does not exceed a certain
critical value, the midplane backflow exists throughout the accretion disc,
extending all the way down to the inner transition zone where the disc
transitions to a magnetic funnel flow. For values of the magnetic Prandtl
number close to the critical value the backflow and the inner disc undergo a
quasiperiodic radial oscillation, otherwise the backflow is steady, as is the
disc solution. From our results, supplemented by our reading of the literature,
we conclude that midplane backflow is a real feature of at least some accretion
discs, whether HD $\alpha$-discs or MHD discs, including ones driven by MRI
turbulence.

strategy. This can benefit from using off-the-shelf single sensor detection
algorithms, but late fusion cannot fully exploit the complementary properties

image proposal with radar points in the polar coordinate system to efficiently
handle the discrepancy between the coordinate system and spatial properties.
Using this as a first stage, following consecutive cross-attention based
feature fusion layers adaptively exchange spatio-contextual information between
camera and radar, leading to a robust and attentive fusion. Our camera-radar

allows us to compute LRRW correlation functions in terms of auxiliary fermionic

various results on long-range fermionic models as well. In principle, all
results derived in this work can be implemented in experimental setups such as
trapped ion systems, where LRRW models appear as an effective description. We
further suggest specific correlation functions which may be applied to the

homogeneous routing games is known to hold for a broad class of evolutionary
dynamics, the stability analysis of user equilibria in heterogeneous routing

systems determined by various ingredients of the system and bath. Apart from
the system-bath interaction, the initial state of the bath, etc., the dimension
of the bath plays a critical role in determining the Markovianity of quantum
dynamics, as a strict decay of the bath correlations requires an infinite
dimension for the bath. In this work, we investigate the role of finite bath
dimension in the Markovianity of quantum dynamics by considering a simple but
nontrivial model in which a central spin is isotropically coupled to a finite
number of bath spins, and show how the dynamics of the central spin transits
from non-Markovian to Markovian as the number of the bath spins increases. The
non-Markovianity is characterized by the information backflow from the bath to
the system in terms of the trace distance of the system states. We derive the
time evolution of the trace distance analytically, and find periodic
collapse-revival patterns in the information flow. The mechanism underlying
this phenomenon is investigated in detail, and it shows that the period of the
collapse-revival pattern is determined by the competition between the number of
the bath spins, the system-bath coupling strength, and the frequency detuning.
When the number of bath spins is sufficiently large, the period of the
collapse-revival structure as well as the respective collapse and revival times
increase in proportion to the number of the bath spins, which characterizes how
the information backflow decays with a large dimension of the bath. We also
analyze the effect of the system-bath interaction strength and frequency
detuning on the collapse-revival patterns of the information flow, and obtain
the condition for the existence of the collapse-revival structure. The results
are illustrated by numerical computation.

reconstruction methods rely on external sensors or have strong prior
assumptions, making the operation complex and limiting their application
scenarios. This paper presents a framework for low-drift surface reconstruction
through multiple tactile measurements, Tac2Structure. Compared with existing
algorithms, the proposed method uses only a new vision-based tactile sensor
without relying on external devices. Aiming at the difficulty that
reconstruction accuracy is easily affected by the pressure at contact, we
propose a correction algorithm to adapt it. The proposed method also reduces
the accumulative errors that occur easily during global object surface
reconstruction. Multi-frame tactile measurements can accurately reconstruct
object surfaces by jointly using the point cloud registration algorithm,
loop-closure detection algorithm based on deep learning, and pose graph
optimization algorithm. Experiments verify that Tac2Structure can achieve
millimeter-level accuracy in reconstructing the surface of objects, providing
accurate tactile information for the robot to perceive the surrounding

the data reach almost the bottom of the M92 main sequence (~0.1 M$_{\odot}$),

also helps characterizing the anthropogenic seismic noise. We show that wind

learning unsupervised representations of graphs. The key idea is to maximize
the agreement between two augmented views of each graph via data augmentation.
Existing GCL models mainly focus on applying \textit{identical augmentation
strategies} for all graphs within a given scenario. However, real-world graphs
are often not monomorphic but abstractions of diverse natures. Even within the
same scenario (e.g., macromolecules and online communities), different graphs
might need diverse augmentations to perform effective GCL. Thus, blindly
augmenting all graphs without considering their individual characteristics may
undermine the performance of GCL arts.To deal with this, we propose the first
principled framework, termed as \textit{G}raph contrastive learning with
\textit{P}ersonalized \textit{A}ugmentation (GPA), to advance conventional GCL
by allowing each graph to choose its own suitable augmentation operations.In
essence, GPA infers tailored augmentation strategies for each graph based on
its topology and node attributes via a learnable augmentation selector, which
is a plug-and-play module and can be effectively trained with downstream GCL
models end-to-end. Extensive experiments across 11 benchmark graphs from
different types and domains demonstrate the superiority of GPA against
state-of-the-art competitors.Moreover, by visualizing the learned augmentation
distributions across different types of datasets, we show that GPA can
effectively identify the most suitable augmentations for each graph based on
its characteristics.

regions with continual photospheric shearing and converging motions. Here,
through high accuracy magnetohydrodynamics simulation, we show how solar
eruption is initiated in a single bipolar configuration as driven by first
shearing and then converging motions at the bottom surface. Different from many
previous simulations, we applied the converging motion without magnetic
diffusion, thus it only increases the magnetic gradient across the polarity
inversion line but without magnetic flux cancellation. The converging motion at
the footpoints of the sheared arcade creates a current sheet in a quasi-static
way, and the eruption is triggered by magnetic reconnection of the current
sheet, which supports the same scenario as shown in our previous simulation
with only shearing motion. With the converging motion, the current sheet is
formed at a lower height and has a higher current density than with shearing
motion alone, which makes reconnection more effective and eruption stronger.
Moreover, the converging motion renders a fast decay rate of the overlying
field with height and thus favorable for an eruption. This demonstrate that the
converging flow is more efficient to create the current sheet and more
favorable for eruption than by solely the shearing flow.

highly accurate optical flows and rigid scene transformations for difficult
scenarios where the brightness assumption is violated by strong shading
changes. In the case of rotating objects or moving light sources, such as those
encountered for driving cars in the dark, the scene appearance often changes
significantly from one view to the next. Unfortunately, standard methods for
calculating optical flows or poses are based on the expectation that the
appearance of features in the scene remain constant between views. These
methods may fail frequently in the investigated cases. The presented method
fuses texture and geometry information by combining image, vertex and normal
data to compute an illumination-invariant optical flow. By using a
coarse-to-fine strategy, globally anchored optical flows are learned, reducing
the impact of erroneous shading-based pseudo-correspondences. Based on the
learned optical flows, a second architecture is proposed that predicts robust
rigid transformations from the warped vertex and normal maps. Particular
attention is payed to situations with strong rotations, which often cause such
shading changes. Therefore a 3-step procedure is proposed that profitably
exploits correlations between the normals and vertices. The method has been
evaluated on a newly created dataset containing both synthetic and real data
with strong rotations and shading effects. This data represents the typical use
case in 3D reconstruction, where the object often rotates in large steps
between the partial reconstructions. Additionally, we apply the method to the
well-known Kitti Odometry dataset. Even if, due to fulfillment of the brighness
assumption, this is not the typical use case of the method, the applicability
to standard situations and the relation to other methods is therefore
established.

necessary computational resources to enact the single process steps. One
well-known approach to solve this issue in a cost-efficient way is to use the
notion of elasticity, i.e., to provide cloud-based computational resources in a
rapid fashion and to enact the single process steps on these resources.
Existing approaches to provide elastic processes are mostly based on Virtual
Machines (VMs). Utilizing container technologies could enable a more
fine-grained allocation of process steps to computational resources, leading to
a better resource utilization and improved cost efficiency.
  In this paper, we propose an approach to optimize resource allocation for
elastic processes by applying a four-fold auto-scaling approach. The main goal
is to minimize the cost of process enactments by using containers. To this end,
we formulate and implement a multi-objective optimization problem applying
Mixed-Integer Linear Programming and use a transformation step to allocate
software services to containers. We thoroughly evaluate the optimization
problem and show that it can lead to significant cost savings while maintaining

class of subcritical $p$-laplacian equations in bounded domains. No hypotheses
on the sign of the solutions, neither of the non-linearities are required. This
method is based in elliptic regularity for the $p$-laplacian combined either
with Gagliardo-Nirenberg or Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg interpolation
inequalities.
  Let us consider a quasilinear boundary value problem $ -\Delta_p u= f(x,u),$
in $\Omega,$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions, where $\Omega \subset
\mathbb{R}^N $, with $p<N,$ is a bounded smooth domain strictly convex, and $f$
is a subcritical Carath\'eodory non-linearity. We provide $L^\infty$ a priori
estimates for weak solutions, in terms of their $L^{p^*}$-norm, where $p^*=
\frac{Np}{N-p}\ $ is the critical Sobolev exponent.
  By a subcritical non-linearity we mean, for instance, $|f(x,s)|\le
|x|^{-\mu}\, \tilde{f}(s),$ where $\mu\in(0,p),$ and
$\tilde{f}(s)/|s|^{p_{\mu}^*-1}\to 0$ as $|s|\to \infty$, here
$p^*_{\mu}:=\frac{p(N-\mu)}{N-p}$ is the critical Sobolev-Hardy exponent. Our
non-linearities includes non-power non-linearities.
  In particular we prove that when
$f(x,s)=|x|^{-\mu}\,\frac{|s|^{p^*_{\mu}-2}s}{\big[\log(e+|s|)\big]^\alpha}\,,$
with $\mu\in[1,p),$ then, for any $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a constant
$C_\varepsilon>0$ such that for any solution $u\in H^1_0(\Omega)$, the
following holds $$ \Big[\log\big(e+\|u\|_{\infty}\big)\Big]^\alpha\le
C_\varepsilon \, \Big(1+\|u\|_{p^*}\Big)^{\, (p^*_{\mu}-p)(1+\varepsilon)}\, ,
$$ where $C_\varepsilon$ is independent of the solution $u$.

intelligence community was whether Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is
achievable. AGI is the ability of machines and computer programs to achieve
human-level intelligence and do all tasks that a human being can. While there
exist a number of systems in the literature claiming they realize AGI, several
other researchers argue that it is impossible to achieve it. In this paper, we
take a different view to the problem. First, we discuss that in order to
realize AGI, along with building intelligent machines and programs, an
intelligent world should also be constructed which is on the one hand, an
accurate approximation of our world and on the other hand, a significant part
of reasoning of intelligent machines is already embedded in this world. Then we
discuss that AGI is not a product or algorithm, rather it is a continuous
process which will become more and more mature over time (like human
civilization and wisdom). Then, we argue that pre-trained embeddings play a key
role in building this intelligent world and as a result, realizing AGI. We
discuss how pre-trained embeddings facilitate achieving several characteristics
of human-level intelligence, such as embodiment, common sense knowledge,
unconscious knowledge and continuality of learning, by machines.

many benefits over the use of general purpose languages for developing model
transformations. However, the actual advantages and disadvantages associated
with the use of model transformation languages are poorly understood
empirically. There is little knowledge over what advantages and disadvantages
hold in which cases and where they originate from. In a prior interview study,
we elicited expert opinions on what advantages result from what factors
surrounding model transformation languages as well as a number of moderating
factors that moderate the influence.
  Objective: We aim to quantitatively asses the interview results to confirm or
reject the influences and moderation effects posed by different factors and to
gain insights into how valuable different factors are to the discussion.
  Method: We gather data on the factors and quality attributes using an online
survey. To analyse the data and examine the hypothesised influences and
moderations we use universal structure modelling based on a structural equation
model. Universal structure modelling will produce significance values and path
coefficients for each hypothesised and modelled interdependence between factors
and quality attributes that can be used to confirm or reject correlation and to
weigh the strength of influence present.
  Limitations: Due to the complexity and abstractness of the concepts under
investigation, a measurement via reflective or formative indicators is not
possible. Instead participants are queried about their assessment of concepts
through a single item question. We further assume that positive and negative
effects of a feature are more prominent if the feature is used more frequently.

results than graph-based branches, we argue that with the proper training

spending less computational resources on inference. In our training strategy,
instead of Asymmetric Loss (ASL), which is the de-facto standard for multilabel

classification sub-problem it operates with $L_2$ normalized feature vectors
coming from a backbone and enforces angles between the normalized
representations of positive and negative samples to be as large as possible.
This results in providing a better discrimination ability, than binary cross

In turn,
the definition of flows in graphs naturally extends to flows in oriented
matroids. So, the colour-flow duality gives a generalization of Hadwiger's
conjecture about graph colourings, to a conjecture about coflows of oriented
matroids. The first non-trivial case of Hadwiger's conjecture for oriented
matroids reads as follows. If $\mathcal{O}$ is an $M(K_4)$-minor free oriented
matroid, then $\mathcal{O}$ has a now-where $3$-coflow, i.e., it is
$3$-colourable in the sense of Hochst\""attler-Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il. The class of
generalized series parallel ($GSP$) oriented matroids is a class of
$3$-colourable oriented matroids with no $M(K_4)$-minor. So far, the only
technique towards proving that all orientations of a class $\mathcal{C}$ of
$M(K_4)$-minor free matroids are $GSP$ (and thus $3$-colourable), has been to
show that every matroid in $\mathcal{C}$ has a positive coline. Towards proving
Hadwiger's conjecture for the class of gammoids, Goddyn, Hochst\""attler, and
Neudauer conjectured that every gammoid has a positive coline. In this work we
disprove this conjecture by exhibiting an infinite class of strict gammoids
that do not have positive colines. We conclude by proposing a simpler technique
for showing that certain oriented matroids are $GSP$. In particular, we recover
that oriented lattice path matroids are $GSP$, and we show that oriented
cobicircular matroids are $GSP$.

approach allowing the identification of subgroups that can be combined with a
broad range of outcome measures including continuous time-to-event outcomes.
When time is measured on a discrete scale, methods and models need to account
for this discreetness as otherwise subgroups might be spurious and effects
biased. The test underlying the splitting criterion of MOB, the M-fluctuation
test, assumes independent observations. However, for fitting discrete
time-to-event models the data matrix has to be modified resulting in an
augmented data matrix violating the independence assumption. We propose MOB for
discrete Survival data (MOB-dS) which controls the type I error rate of the
test used for data splitting and therefore the rate of identifying subgroups
although none is present. MOB-ds uses a permutation approach accounting for
dependencies in the augmented time-to-event data to obtain the distribution
under the null hypothesis of no subgroups being present. Through simulations we
investigate the type I error rate of the new MOB-dS and the standard MOB for
different patterns of survival curves and event rates. We find that the type I
error rates of the test is well controlled for MOB-dS, but observe some
considerable inflations of the error rate for MOB. To illustrate the proposed
methods, MOB-dS is applied to data on unemployment duration.

This is because such applications demand ultra-low latency, hyper-connectivity,

inadequate to address the new challenges. Hence, we envision that the future
edge computing is moving towards distributed intelligence, where heterogeneous

only 24 confirmed BLAPs have been identified from more than one billion
monitored stars, including a group with pulsation period longer than $\sim 20$
min (classical BLAPs, hereafter) and the other group with pulsation period
below $\sim 8$ min. The evolutionary path that could give rise to such kinds of
stellar configurations is unclear. Here we report on a comprehensive study of
the peculiar BLAP discovered by the Tsinghua University - Ma Huateng Telescopes
for Survey (TMTS), TMTS J035143.63+584504.2 (TMTS-BLAP-1). This new BLAP has an
18.9 min pulsation period and is similar to the BLAPs with a low surface
gravity and an extended helium-enriched envelope, suggesting that it is a
low-gravity BLAP at the shortest-period end. In particular, the long-term
monitoring data reveal that this pulsating star has an unusually large rate of
period change, P_dot/P=2.2e-6/yr. Such a significant and positive value
challenges its origins from both helium-core pre-white-dwarfs and core
helium-burning subdwarfs, but is consistent with that derived from shell
helium-burning subdwarfs. The particular pulsation period and unusual rate of
period change indicate that TMTS-BLAP-1 is at a short-lived (~10^6 yr) phase of
shell-helium ignition before the stable shell-helium burning; in other words,
TMTS-BLAP-1 is going through a ""Hertzsprung gap"" of hot subdwarfs.

minimization problem, while sub-channel assignment, computational resource
allocation, and power allocation are considered at follower-level as a latency
minimization problem. By dividing the follower-level problem into two

and discovering new neural architectures for different target platforms and
purposes. However, scanning the search space is comprised of long training
processes of many candidate architectures, which is costly in terms of
computational resources and time. Regression algorithms are a common tool to
predicting a candidate architecture's accuracy, which can dramatically
accelerate the search procedure. We aim at proposing a new baseline that will
support the development of regression algorithms that can predict an
architecture's accuracy just from its scheme, or by only training it for a
minimal number of epochs. Therefore, we introduce the NAAP-440 dataset of 440
neural architectures, which were trained on CIFAR10 using a fixed recipe. Our
experiments indicate that by using off-the-shelf regression algorithms and
running up to 10% of the training process, not only is it possible to predict
an architecture's accuracy rather precisely, but that the values predicted for
the architectures also maintain their accuracy order with a minimal number of
monotonicity violations. This approach may serve as a powerful tool for
accelerating NAS-based studies and thus dramatically increase their efficiency.

inflow conditions having freestream turbulence intensity between 3 % and 12 %,
and integral time scales in the range of 0.1 to 10 times the convective
timescale based on the turbine diameter. It is observed that the wake generated
by the turbine evolves more rapidly, with the onset of the wake evolution being
closer to the turbine, for high turbulence intensity and low integral time
scale flows, in accordance with literature, while flows at higher integral time
scales result in a slow wake evolution, akin to that generated by
low-turbulence inflow conditions despite the highly-turbulent ambient
condition. The delayed onset of the wake evolution is connected to the
stability of the shear layer enveloping the near wake, which is favoured for
low-turbulence or high-integral time scale flows, and to the stability of the
helical vortex set surrounding the wake, as this favours interaction events and
prevents momentum exchange at the wake boundary which hinder wake evolution.
The rate at which the velocity in the wake recovers to undisturbed conditions
is instead analytically shown to be a function of the Reynolds shear stress at
the wake centreline, an observation that is confirmed by measurements. The rate
of production of Reynolds shear stress in the wake is then connected to the
power harvested by the turbine to explain the differences between flows at
constant turbulence intensity and different integral time scales.

light and aligned Higgs boson, $H = H(125)$. It has been studied in the
one-loop approximation of its effective potential, $V_1$. An important
consequence is that the masses of the model's BSM Higgs bosons ($H',A,H^\pm$)
are bounded by the sum rule $\left(M_{H'}^4 + M_A^4 + 2M_{H^\pm}^4\right)^{1/4}
= 540\,{\rm GeV}$. Although they are well within reach of the LHC, searches for
them have been stymied by large QCD backgrounds. Another consequence is that
$H$ is highly aligned, i.e., $H$--$H'$ mixing is small and $H$ has only
Standard Model couplings. A corollary of this alignment is that search modes
such as $H',\,A \leftrightarrow W^+W^-,\,ZZ,\,HZ$ and $H^\pm \leftrightarrow
W^\pm Z,\,W^\pm H$ are greatly suppressed. To assess the accuracy of the sum
rule and Higgs alignment, we study this model in two loops. This calculation is
complicated by having many new contributions. We present two formulations of it
to calculate the $H$--$H'$ mass matrix, its eigenvectors $H_1,\,H_2$, and the
mass $M_{H_2}$ while fixing $M_{H_1}= 125\,{\rm GeV}$. They give similar
results, in accord with the one-loop results. Requiring $M_A = M_{H^\pm}$, we
find $180\,{\rm GeV} < M_{A,H^\pm} < 380$--$425\,{\rm GeV}$ and
$550$--$700\,{\rm GeV} > M_{H_2} > 125\,{\rm GeV}$, with $M_{H_2}$ decreasing
as $M_{A,H^\pm}$ increase. The corrections to $H$-alignment are below
${\cal{O}}(1\%)$. So, the BSM searches above will remain fruitless. Finding the
BSM Higgses requires improved sensitivity to their low masses. We discuss two

word segments onto fixed-dimensionality vector representations such that
different acoustic exemplars of the same word are projected nearby in the
embedding space. In addition to their speech technology applications, AWE
models have been shown to predict human performance on a variety of auditory
lexical processing tasks. Current AWE models are based on neural networks and
trained in a bottom-up approach that integrates acoustic cues to build up a
word representation given an acoustic or symbolic supervision signal.
Therefore, these models do not leverage or capture high-level lexical knowledge
during the learning process. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning
model that incorporates top-down lexical knowledge into the training procedure
of AWEs. Our model learns a mapping between the acoustic input and a lexical
representation that encodes high-level information such as word semantics in
addition to bottom-up form-based supervision. We experiment with three
languages and demonstrate that incorporating lexical knowledge improves the

example, when writing papers or articles, we usually first write drafts, and
then iteratively polish them until satisfied. In light of such a human
cognitive process, we propose DECOM, which is a multi-pass deliberation
framework for automatic comment generation. DECOM consists of multiple
Deliberation Models and one Evaluation Model. Given a code snippet, we first
extract keywords from the code and retrieve a similar code fragment from a
pre-defined corpus. Then, we treat the comment of the retrieved code as the
initial draft and input it with the code and keywords into DECOM to start the
iterative deliberation process. At each deliberation, the deliberation model
polishes the draft and generates a new comment. The evaluation model measures
the quality of the newly generated comment to determine whether to end the
iterative process or not. When the iterative process is terminated, the
best-generated comment will be selected as the target comment. Our approach is
evaluated on two real-world datasets in Java (87K) and Python (108K), and
experiment results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art
baselines. A human evaluation study also confirms the comments generated by
DECOM tend to be more readable, informative, and useful.

transition from bi-directional sliding with extension to pure extension with no

remarkable success in dialog understanding tasks. However, current contrastive
learning solely considers the self-augmented dialog samples as positive samples

representations even for dialogs that are semantically related. In this paper,
we propose SPACE-2, a tree-structured pre-trained conversation model, which
learns dialog representations from limited labeled dialogs and large-scale
unlabeled dialog corpora via semi-supervised contrastive pre-training.
Concretely, we first define a general semantic tree structure (STS) to unify
the inconsistent annotation schema across different dialog datasets, so that
the rich structural information stored in all labeled data can be exploited.
Then we propose a novel multi-view score function to increase the relevance of
all possible dialogs that share similar STSs and only push away other
completely different dialogs during supervised contrastive pre-training. To
fully exploit unlabeled dialogs, a basic self-supervised contrastive loss is
also added to refine the learned representations. Experiments show that our
method can achieve new state-of-the-art results on the DialoGLUE benchmark

results for several classes of these observables, exactly as a function of $N$

employing the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ spectral decomposition: in this
S-duality-invariant eigenbasis, the integrated correlators are fixed simply by
polynomials in the spectral parameter. These polynomials are determined
recursively by linear algebraic equations relating different $N$ and $p$, such
that all integrated correlators are ultimately fixed in terms of the integrated

inhomogeneity and disorder from doping makes these signatures unclear and
inconsistent between vortices. Here we report superconductivity in monolayer
FeTe1-ySey (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi2Te3 by molecular beam epitaxy. Spin and
angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy directly resolve the interfacial spin

Bi2Te3 interfacial states which disrupts the desired spin-momentum locking. In
contrast, for y = 0.1 a smaller Fe(Te,Se) Fermi surface allows for clear
spin-momentum locking observed in the topological states. Hence, we demonstrate
the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 system is a highly tunable platform for realizing Majorana
bound states where reduced doping can improve characteristics important for

bottom drag are a prototypical model for mid-latitude geophysical flow that
experience energy loss through simple topography. Motivated by numerical
schemes for large-scale geophysical flow, we consider this model on the whole
space with horizontal kinetic energy backscatter source terms built from
negative viscosity and stabilizing hyperviscosity with constant parameters. We
study its interplay with linear and non-smooth quadratic bottom drag through
the existence of coherent flows. Our results highlight that backscatter can
have undesired amplification and selection effects, generating obstacles to
energy distribution. We find that decreasing linear bottom drag destabilizes
the trivial flow and generates nonlinear flows that can be associated with
geostrophic equilibria (GE) and inertia-gravity waves (IGWs). The IGWs are
periodic travelling waves, while the GE are stationary and can be studied by a
plane wave reduction. We show that for isotropic backscatter both bifurcate
simultaneously and supercritically, while for anisotropic backscatter the
primary bifurcation are GE. In all cases presence of non-smooth quadratic
bottom drag implies unusual scaling laws. For the rigorous bifurcation analysis
by Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction care has to be taken due to this lack of
smoothness and since the hyperviscous terms yield a lack of spectral gap at
large wave numbers. For purely smooth bottom drag, we identify a class of
explicit such flows that behave linearly within the nonlinear equations:
amplitudes can be steady and arbitrary, or grow exponentially and unboundedly.
We illustrate the results by numerical computations and present extended
branches in parameter space.

alignment of the conversation, there has been no thorough study to date on
which parts of the context and history are necessary for the model. We argue
that shortening the context and history is crucial as it can help the model to
optimise more on the conversational alignment property. To this end, we propose
CoHS-CQG, a two-stage CQG framework, which adopts a CoHS module to shorten the

of a \emph{unique probabilistic strong solution}. Finally, we allow both
diffusion coefficient $\mathrm{B}(t,\cdot)$ and jump noise coefficient
$\gamma(t,\cdot,z)$ to depend on both $\mathbb{H}$-norm and $\mathbb{V}$-norm,
which implies that both the coefficients could also depend on the gradient of
solution. We establish the global solvability results.

asteroid Dimorphos on September 26, 2022 as a test of the kinetic impactor
technique for planetary defense. The efficiency of the deflection following a
kinetic impactor can be represented using the momentum enhancement factor,
Beta, which is dependent on factors such as impact geometry and the specific
target material properties. Currently, very little is known about Dimorphos and
its material properties that introduces uncertainty in the results of the
deflection efficiency observables, including crater formation, ejecta
distribution, and Beta. The DART Impact Modeling Working Group (IWG) is
responsible for using impact simulations to better understand the results of
the DART impact. Pre-impact simulation studies also provide considerable
insight into how different properties and impact scenarios affect momentum
enhancement following a kinetic impact. This insight provides a basis for
predicting the effects of the DART impact and the first understanding of how to
interpret results following the encounter. Following the DART impact, the
knowledge gained from these studies will inform the initial simulations that
will recreate the impact conditions, including providing estimates for
potential material properties of Dimorphos and Beta resulting from DARTs
impact. This paper summarizes, at a high level, what has been learned from the
IWG simulations and experiments in preparation for the DART impact. While
unknown, estimates for reasonable potential material properties of Dimorphos
provide predictions for Beta of 1-5, depending on end-member cases in the
strength regime.

dialog (TOD) systems. However, most existing pre-trained models for TOD focus
on either dialog understanding or dialog generation, but not both. In this
paper, we propose SPACE-3, a novel unified semi-supervised pre-trained
conversation model learning from large-scale dialog corpora with limited
annotations, which can be effectively fine-tuned on a wide range of downstream
dialog tasks. Specifically, SPACE-3 consists of four successive components in a
single transformer to maintain a task-flow in TOD systems: (i) a dialog
encoding module to encode dialog history, (ii) a dialog understanding module to
extract semantic vectors from either user queries or system responses, (iii) a
dialog policy module to generate a policy vector that contains high-level
semantics of the response, and (iv) a dialog generation module to produce
appropriate responses. We design a dedicated pre-training objective for each
component. Concretely, we pre-train the dialog encoding module with span mask
language modeling to learn contextualized dialog information. To capture the
structured dialog semantics, we pre-train the dialog understanding module via a
novel tree-induced semi-supervised contrastive learning objective with the help
of extra dialog annotations. In addition, we pre-train the dialog policy module
by minimizing the L2 distance between its output policy vector and the semantic
vector of the response for policy optimization. Finally, the dialog generation
model is pre-trained by language modeling. Results show that SPACE-3 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on eight downstream dialog benchmarks, including
intent prediction, dialog state tracking, and end-to-end dialog modeling. We
also show that SPACE-3 has a stronger few-shot ability than existing models
under the low-resource setting.

membrane building blocks for a wide range of organisms. Adipose triglyceride
lipase (ATGL) is the first and presumingly most crucial regulator of FA release
from triacylglycerols (TGs) stored within cytosolic lipid droplets. However,
besides the function of releasing FAs by hydrolysing TGs into diacylglycerols
(DGs), ATGL also promotes the transacylation reaction of two DG molecules into
one TG and one monoacylglycerol molecule. To date, it is unknown whether DG
transacylation is a coincidental byproduct of ATGL-mediated lipolysis or
whether it is physiologically relevant. Experimental evidence is scarce since
both, hydrolysis and transacylation, rely on the same active site of ATGL and
always occur in parallel in an ensemble of molecules.
  This paper illustrates the potential roles of transacylation. It shows that,
depending on the kinetic parameters but also on the state of the hydrolytic
machinery, transacylation can increase or decrease downstream products up to
50\% and more. We provide an extensive asymptotic analysis including
quasi-steady-state approximations (QSSA) with higher order correction terms and
provide numerical simulation. We also argue that when assessing the validity of
QSSAs one should include parameter sensitivity derivatives. Our results suggest
that the transacylation function of ATGL is of biological relevance by
providing feedback options and altogether stability to the lipolytic machinery
in adipocytes.

large separation of time scales involved. Such an approximation is then adapted

is equivalent to the well-known family of Shor codes. Moreover, we show that
$\mathcal{Q}_1$ codes significantly outperform Shor codes, of the same length
and minimum distance. Second, we consider the fault-tolerant preparation of
$\mathcal{Q}_1$ code states. We give a recursive procedure to prepare a
$\mathcal{Q}_1$ code state, based on two-qubit Pauli measurements only. The
procedure is not by itself fault-tolerant, however, the measurement operations
therein provide redundant classical bits, which can be advantageously used for
error detection. Fault-tolerance is then achieved by combining the proposed
recursive procedure with an error detection method. Finally, we consider the
fault-tolerant error correction of $\mathcal{Q}_1$ codes. We use Steane error
correction, which incorporates the proposed fault-tolerant code state
preparation procedure. We provide numerical estimates of the logical error
rates for $\mathcal{Q}_1$ and Shor codes of length $16$ and $64$ qubits,
assuming a circuit-level depolarizing noise model. Remarkably, the
$\mathcal{Q}_1$ code of length $64$ qubits achieves a logical error rate very

closed-loop 7-degree-of-freedom (7-DoF) grasping on cluttered environments. The
key aspects of our method are that 1) the proposed pipeline exploits the TSDF
volume in terms of multi-view fusion, contact-point sampling and evaluation,
and collision checking, which provides reliable and collision-free 7-DoF
gripper poses with real-time performance; 2) the contact-based pose
representation effectively eliminates the ambiguity introduced by the
normal-based methods, which provides a more precise and flexible solution.
Extensive simulated and real-robot experiments demonstrate that the proposed
pipeline can select more antipodal and stable grasp poses and outperforms
normal-based baselines in terms of the grasp success rate in both simulated and
physical scenarios.

interference of two-photon transitions (RABBITT) in strongly polar molecules.
The time-dependent energy of a polar molecule in the IR field gives rise to an
additional dipole-laser coupling contribution to the sideband delay. In a
time-independent picture this translates to the initial state being in
superposition of IR-dressed states. We extend the recently developed
time-independent molecular R-matrix method to include the additional
interfering ionization pathways arising from the IR-dressed initial state and
obtain very good agreement with a reference non-perturbative time-dependent
RABBITT simulation. Finally, we discuss the asymptotic behaviour of such
ionization amplitudes and recover a known approximate asymptotic formula for
the dipole-laser coupling delay derived earlier in the context of attosecond
streaking. At low photon energies the dipole-laser coupling contributes
significantly even in an unoriented molecular sample.

  figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  This paper proposes a new concept called virtual inertia scheduling (VIS) to
efficiently handle the high penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs). VIS
is an inertia management framework that targets security-constrained and
economy-oriented inertia scheduling and generation dispatch of power systems
with a large scale of renewable generations. Specifically, it schedules the
proper power setting points and reserved capacities of both synchronous
generators and IBRs, as well as the control modes and control parameters of
IBRs to provide secure and cost-effective inertia support. First, a uniform
system model is employed to quantify the frequency dynamics of the
IBRs-penetrated power system after disturbances. Based on the model, the
s-domain and time-domain analytical responses of IBRs with inertia support
capability are derived. Then, VIS-based real-time economic dispatch (VIS-RTED)
is formulated to minimize generation and reserve costs, with a full
consideration of dynamic frequency constraints and derived inertia support
reserve constraints. The virtual inertia and damping of IBRs are formulated as
decision variables. To address the non-linearity of dynamic constraints, deep
learning-assisted linearization is employed to solve the optimization problem.
Finally, the proposed VIS-RTED is demonstrated on a modified IEEE 39-bus
system. A full-order time-domain simulation is performed to verify the
scheduling results.

different domains. We evaluate recent approaches and find imbalanced
performances across domains. Further, we consider a third setting, where camera

across datasets in this setting. This is because their cost volume output runs
out of distribution. To resolve this, we present the Robust MVD Baseline model

employs a novel scale augmentation procedure. It can be applied for robust

three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that
relativistic topological waves can be generated via Cherenkov and Doppler
resonances in the interaction of intense femtosecond laser pulses with
near-critical-density plasmas. At the self-magnetized plasma-plasma interface,
a new slow-wave branch appears. Its phase velocity is much smaller than the
group velocity of the laser pulse and the electron beam velocity. Therefore,
the Cherenkov resonance condition can be easily satisfied. Furthermore, since
electrons undergo betatron oscillations, Doppler resonances may also occur and
are responsible for the excitation of several frequency-shifted branches
observed in our simulations. After the passage of the laser pulse, we observe a
fast remnant mode with relativistic amplitude and frequency close to the local
plasma frequency. This mode continues to accelerate electrons further for many
tens of laser periods even after the laser pulse has left the plasma.

retrieval. NRMs have also been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples.
A typical Word Substitution Ranking Attack (WSRA) against NRMs was proposed
recently, in which an attacker promotes a target document in rankings by adding
human-imperceptible perturbations to its text. This raises concerns when
deploying NRMs in real-world applications. Therefore, it is important to
develop techniques that defend against such attacks for NRMs. In empirical
defenses adversarial examples are found during training and used to augment the
training set. However, such methods offer no theoretical guarantee on the
models' robustness and may eventually be broken by other sophisticated WSRAs.
To escape this arms race, rigorous and provable certified defense methods for
NRMs are needed.
  To this end, we first define the \textit{Certified Top-$K$ Robustness} for
ranking models since users mainly care about the top ranked results in
real-world scenarios. A ranking model is said to be Certified Top-$K$ Robust on
a ranked list when it is guaranteed to keep documents that are out of the top
$K$ away from the top $K$ under any attack. Then, we introduce a Certified
Defense method, named CertDR, to achieve certified top-$K$ robustness against
WSRA, based on the idea of randomized smoothing. Specifically, we first
construct a smoothed ranker by applying random word substitutions on the
documents, and then leverage the ranking property jointly with the statistical
property of the ensemble to provably certify top-$K$ robustness. Extensive
experiments on two representative web search datasets demonstrate that CertDR
can significantly outperform state-of-the-art empirical defense methods for
ranking models.

the computational burden in both system calibration and gaze estimation, and
dramatically reduces the system latency; while the latter overcomes the data
labeling hurdle of existing supervised learning-based counterparts, and ensures

system to explore human perception of photon number states. In detector
tomography, instead of using very hard to produce photon number states, the
response of a detector to light pulses with known photon statistics of varying
intensity is recorded, and a model is fitted to the experimental outcomes
thereby inferring the detector's photon number state response. Generally, light
pulses containing a Poisson-distributed number of photons are utilised, which
are very easy to produce in the lab. This technique has not been explored to
study the human visual system before, because it usually requires a very large
number of repetitions not suitable for experiments on humans. Yet, in the
present study we show that detector tomography is feasible for human
experiments. Assuming a simple model for this accuracy, the results of our
simulations show that detector tomography is able to reconstruct the model
using Bayesian inference with as little as $5000$ trials. We then optimize the
experimental parameters in order to maximise the probability of showing that
the single-photon accuracy is above chance. As such, our study opens the road
to study human perception on quantum level.

proposed in previous work, whose use was justified (or not) on criteria such as
typology or data scarcity. Second, we run a large-scale version of this
experiment, create vast amounts of random subsets of treebanks, and compare on
them many parsers whose scores are available. The results show substantial
variability across subsets and that although establishing guidelines for good
treebank selection is hard, it is possible to detect potentially harmful
strategies.

Radau IIA type fully implicit Runge--Kutta methods, which approximates the
inverse of $A_Q$ from the Butcher tableau by the lower triangular matrix
resulting from an LU decomposition and diagonalizes the system with as many
blocks as stages. For the transformed system, we employ a block preconditioner
where each block is distributed and solved by a subgroup of processes in
parallel. For combination of partial results, we either use a communication
pattern resembling Cannon's algorithm or shared memory. A performance model and
a large set of performance studies (including strong scaling runs with up to
150k processes on 3k compute nodes) conducted for a time-dependent heat
problem, using matrix-free finite element methods, indicate that the
stage-parallel implementation can reach higher throughputs when the block
solvers operate at lower parallel efficiencies, which occurs near the scaling
limit. Achievable speedup increases linearly with number of stages and are
bounded by the number of stages. Furthermore, we show that the presented
stage-parallel concepts are also applicable to the case that $A_Q$ is directly
diagonalized, which requires complex arithmetic or the solution of two-by-two
blocks and sequentializes parts of the algorithm. Alternatively to distributing
stages and assigning them to distinct processes, we discuss the possibility of
batching operations from different stages together.

the domain and application scenario and might not be known at the time of model
development. This conflicts with the classical paradigm of supervised learning
in which the labels need to be predefined. A solution to obtain a model with a
flexible set of labels is to use the paradigm of zero-shot learning as a
natural language inference task, which in addition adds the advantage of not
needing any labeled training data. This raises the question how to prompt a
natural language inference model for zero-shot learning emotion classification.
Options for prompt formulations include the emotion name anger alone or the
statement ""This text expresses anger"". With this paper, we analyze how
sensitive a natural language inference-based zero-shot-learning classifier is
to such changes to the prompt under consideration of the corpus: How carefully
does the prompt need to be selected? We perform experiments on an established
set of emotion datasets presenting different language registers according to
different sources (tweets, events, blogs) with three natural language inference
models and show that indeed the choice of a particular prompt formulation needs
to fit to the corpus. We show that this challenge can be tackled with
combinations of multiple prompts. Such ensemble is more robust across corpora
than individual prompts and shows nearly the same performance as the individual
best prompt for a particular corpus.

coupled, allowing polarization to be controlled by a magnetic field, and
magnetization by an electric field, but the magnitude of the effect remains a
challenge in the case of single-phase magnetoelectrics for application. We
demonstrate that the magnetoelectric properties of the mixed-anisotropy
antiferromagnet LiNi$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$PO$_4$ are profoundly affected by replacing a
fraction of the Ni$^{2+}$ ions with Fe$^{2+}$ on the transition metal site.
This introduces random site-dependent single-ion anisotropy energies and causes
a lowering of the magnetic symmetry of the system. In turn, magnetoelectric
couplings that are symmetry-forbidden in the parent compounds, LiNiPO$_4$ and
LiFePO$_4$, are unlocked and the dominant coupling is enhanced by two orders of
magnitude. Our results demonstrate the potential of mixed-anisotropy magnets
for tuning magnetoelectric properties.

necessary intervention calculus. Furthermore through the bespoke causal

\cite{Raymond20a,Raymond20b} on vorticity in the post-shock fluid of the Cygnus
Loop supernova remnant are therefore of great interest. We consider the degree
to which spectroscopic measurements of an optically-thin line, the most common
type of astronomical velocimetry, can yield unambiguous measurements of the
vorticity in a fluid. We consider an ideal case of observations in the plane of
a flow which may or may not contain vorticity. In one case, the flow possesses
vorticity in a direction perpendicular to the plane of observations. In the
other case, the flow is irrotational (zero vorticity) by construction. The
observationally-deduced vorticity (referred to as the {\em pseudovorticity}) is
inferred from spatial differences in the line-of-sight component of velocity,
and assumptions of symmetry. My principal result is that in the case of the
vortical flow, the pseudovorticity is a reasonable match for the true
vorticity. However, and importantly, the pseudovorticity in the case of the
irrotational flow field is also nonzero, and comparable in magnitude to that
for a vortical flow. The conclusion of this paper is that while astronomical
spectroscopic observations may yield a good estimate of the vorticity in a
remote fluid, the robustness of such an inference cannot be insured.

(dislocations) which interact and move on microscopic time and length scales.
Two of the commonly used models to describe such dislocation dynamics are the
Peierls-Nabarro model and the so-called discrete dislocation dynamics model.
  However, the consistency between these two models is known only for a few
number of dislocations or up to the first time at which two dislocations
collide. In this paper we resolve these restrictions, and establish the
consistency for any number of dislocations and without any restriction on their
initial position or orientation.
  In more detail, the evolutive Peierls-Nabarro model which we consider
describes the evolution of a phase-field function $v_\e(t,x)$ which represents
the atom deformation in a crystal. The model is a reaction-diffusion equation
of Allen-Cahn type with the half Laplacian. The small parameter $\ep$ is the
ratio between the atomic distance and the typical distance between phase
transitions in $v_\e$. The position of a phase transition determines the
position of a dislocation, and the sign of the transition (up or down)
determines the orientation.
  The goal of this paper is to derive the asymptotic behavior of the function
$v_\e$ as $\ep\to0$ up to arbitrary end time $T$; in particular beyond
collisions. We prove that $v_\e$ converges to a piecewise constant function
$v$, whose jump points in the spatial variable satisfy the ODE system which
represents discrete dislocation dynamics with annihilation. Our proof method is
to explicitly construct and patch together several sub- and supersolutions of
$v_\e$, and to show that they converge to the same limit $v$.

weakly-twisted flux rope is composed mainly of transient threads, forming
high-speed flows inside the prominence. Its horns are evident. Conversely, the
one supported by a highly-twisted flux rope consists mainly of stable
quasi-stationary threads, including longer independently trapped threads and
shorter magnetically connected threads. It is also revealed that the prominence
spine deviates from the flux rope axis in the vertical direction and from the

this paper we study the newly discovered phenomenon in the foundations of

in spirit is close to classical HA in computer science. However, GHA is
typically independent of the P vs. NP question in many cases. Thus, it requires
a new mathematical framework that we initiate in this paper. We demonstrate the
hitherto undiscovered phenomenon that GHA happens when using AI techniques in
order to train optimal neural networks (NNs). In particular, for any non-zero
underdetermined linear problem the following phase transition may occur: One
can prove the existence of optimal NNs for solving the problem but they can
only be computed to a certain accuracy $\epsilon_0 > 0$. Below the
approximation threshold $\epsilon_0$ -- not only does it become intractable to
compute the NN -- it becomes impossible regardless of computing power, and no
randomised algorithm can solve the problem with probability better than 1/2. In
other cases, despite the existence of a stable optimal NN, any attempts of

With this in mind, the purpose of this study is to present statistical
approaches that may be employed in nonparametric nonhomogeneous data
frameworks, as well as to examine their application in the field of natural
language processing and language clustering. Furthermore, this paper discusses
the many uses of nonparametric approaches in linguistic data mining and
processing. The data depth idea allows for the centre-outward ordering of
points in any dimension, resulting in a new nonparametric multivariate
statistical analysis that does not require any distributional assumptions. The
concept of hierarchy is used in historical language categorisation and
structuring, and it aims to organise and cluster languages into subfamilies
using the same premise. In this regard, the current study presents a novel
approach to language family structuring based on non-parametric approaches
produced from a typological structure of words in various languages, which is
then converted into a Cartesian framework using MDS. This
statistical-depth-based architecture allows for the use of data-depth-based
methodologies for robust outlier detection, which is extremely useful in
understanding the categorization of diverse borderline languages and allows for
the re-evaluation of existing classification systems. Other depth-based
approaches are also applied to processes such as unsupervised and supervised
clustering. This paper therefore provides an overview of procedures that can be
applied to nonhomogeneous language classification systems in a nonparametric
framework.

GX, our primary motivation and target is fusion reactor design, rather than
physics exploration or comprehensive validation studies. This has led to
several code and algorithm design decisions, specifically chosen to prioritize
time to solution. First, we have used a discretization algorithm that is
pseudo-spectral in the entire phase-space, including a Laguerre-Hermite
pseudo-spectral formulation of velocity space, which allows for smooth
interpolation between coarse gyrofluid-like resolutions and finer conventional
gyrokinetic resolutions. Additionally, we have built GX to natively target
graphics processors (GPUs), which are the fastest computational platforms
available today. Finally, we have taken advantage of the reactor-relevant limit
of small $\rho_*$ by using the radially-local flux-tube approach. In this paper
we present details about the gyrokinetic system and the numerical algorithms
used to solve it in GX. We then present several numerical benchmarks against
established gyrokinetic codes in both tokamak and stellarator magnetic
geometries to verify that GX correctly simulates gyrokinetic turbulence in the
small $\rho_*$ limit. Moreover, we show that the convergence properties of the
Laguerre-Hermite spectral velocity formulation are quite favorable for
nonlinear problems of interest. Coupled with GPU acceleration, which we also
investigate with scaling studies, this enables GX to be able to produce useful
turbulence simulations in minutes on one (or a few) GPUs. GX is open-source
software that is ready for fusion reactor design studies.

due to 20 ps long voltage pulses of alternating polarity. Through the analysis

a practical testing method that can be used to raise confidence in the
correctness of the system by only requiring that the system under test can be

important step is to reduce the number of simulations needed to falsify a

that learns a surrogate model that describes the relationship between the
parametrization of possible input signals and the evaluation of the

  In this paper, we improve the falsification using BO by; first adopting two
prominent BO methods, one fits local surrogate models, and the other exploits
the user's prior knowledge. Secondly, the formulation of acquisition functions
for falsification is addressed in this paper. Benchmark evaluation shows
significant improvements in using local surrogate models of BO for falsifying

that have existed in the past. Scientists such as Charles Darwin and Alfred
Wallace dedicate their life to observe how species interact with their
environment, grow, and change. We are able to predict future changes as well as
simulate the process using genetic algorithms. Genetic Algorithms give us the
opportunity to present multiple variables and parameters to an environment and
change values to simulate different situations. By optimizing genetic
algorithms to hold entities in an environment, we are able to assign varying
characteristics such as speed, size, and cloning probability, to the entities
to simulate real natural selection and evolution in a shorter period of time.
Learning about how species grow and evolve allows us to find ways to improve
technology, help animals going extinct to survive, and figure* out how diseases
spread and possible ways of making an environment uninhabitable for them. Using
data from an environment including genetic algorithms and parameters of speed,
size, and cloning percentage, the ability to test several changes in the
environment and observe how the species interacts within it appears. After
testing different environments with a varied amount of food while keeping the
number of starting population at 10 entities, it was found that an environment
with a scarce amount of food was not sustainable for small and slow entities.
All environments displayed an increase in speed, but the environments that were
richer in food allowed for the entities to live for the entire duration of 50
generations, as well as allowed the population to grow significantly.

geometric, coordinate-free relationships between the 4D geometric,
coordinate-free quantities. It is mathematicaly proved that in the ISR the
electric and magnetic fields are properly defined vectors on the 4D spacetime.
According to the first proof the dimension of a vector field is mathematicaly
determined by the dimension of its domain. Since the electric and magnetic
fields are defined on the 4D spacetime they are properly defined 4D vectors,
the 4D geometric quantities (GQs). As shown in an axiomatic geometric

bivector field F. The electric and magnetic fields 4D vectors E and B are
determined in a mathematically correct way in terms of F and the 4D velocity
vector v of the observer who measures E and B fields. Furthermore, the proofs
are presented that under the mathematicaly correct Lorentz transformations,
which are first derived by Minkowski and reinvented and generalized in terms of

again to the electric field 4D vector; there is no mixing with the magnetic

  Analytic Framework To Model Diffusion With Inert Spatial Heterogeneities",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Abridged abstract: Inert interactions between randomly moving entities and
spatial disorder play a crucial role in quantifying the diffusive properties of
a system. These interactions affect only the movement of the entities, and
examples range from molecules advancing along dendritic spines to anti-predator
displacements of animals due to sparse vegetation. Despite the prevalence of
such systems, a general framework to model the movement explicitly in the
presence of spatial heterogeneities is missing. Here, we tackle this challenge
and develop an analytic theory to model inert particle-environment interactions
in domains of arbitrary shape and dimensions. We use a discrete space
formulation which allows us to model the interactions between an agent and the
environment as perturbed dynamics between lattice sites. Interactions from
spatial disorder, such as impenetrable and permeable obstacles or regions of
increased or decreased diffusivity, as well as many others, can be modelled
using our framework. We provide exact expressions for the generating function
of the occupation probability of the diffusing particle and related transport
quantities such as first-passage, return and exit probabilities and their
respective means. We uncover a surprising property, the disorder indifference
phenomenon of the mean first-passage time in the presence of a permeable
barrier in quasi-1D systems. We demonstrate the widespread applicability of our
formalism by considering three examples that span across scales and
disciplines. (1) We explore an enhancement strategy of transdermal drug
delivery. (2) We associate the disorder with a decision-making process of an
animal to study thigmotaxis. (3) We illustrate the use of spatial
heterogeneities to model inert interactions between particles by modelling the
search for a promoter region on the DNA by transcription factors during gene
transcription.

  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2110.12163",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wearable sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has emerged as a
principal research area and is utilized in a variety of applications. Recently,
deep learning-based methods have achieved significant improvement in the HAR
field with the development of human-computer interaction applications. However,
they are limited to operating in a local neighborhood in the process of a
standard convolution neural network, and correlations between different sensors
on body positions are ignored. In addition, they still face significant
challenging problems with performance degradation due to large gaps in the
distribution of training and test data, and behavioral differences between
subjects. In this work, we propose a novel Transformer-based Adversarial
learning framework for human activity recognition using wearable sensors via
Self-KnowledgE Distillation (TASKED), that accounts for individual sensor
orientations and spatial and temporal features. The proposed method is capable
of learning cross-domain embedding feature representations from multiple
subjects datasets using adversarial learning and the maximum mean discrepancy
(MMD) regularization to align the data distribution over multiple domains. In
the proposed method, we adopt the teacher-free self-knowledge distillation to
improve the stability of the training procedure and the performance of human
activity recognition. Experimental results show that TASKED not only
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the four real-world public HAR datasets
(alone or combined) but also improves the subject generalization effectively.

applications. Despite the recent progress in human motion prediction, most
studies simplify the problem by predicting the human motion relative to a fixed
joint and/or only limit their model to predict one possible future motion.
While due to the complex nature of human motion, a single output cannot reflect
all the possible actions one can do. Also, for any robotics application, we
need the full human motion including the user trajectory not a 3d pose relative
to the hip joint.
  In this paper, we try to address these two issues by proposing a
transformer-based generative model for forecasting multiple diverse human
motions. Our model generates \textit{N} future possible motion by querying a
history of human motion. Our model first predicts the pose of the body relative
to the hip joint. Then the \textit{Hip Prediction Module} predicts the
trajectory of the hip movement for each predicted pose frame. To emphasize on
the diverse future motions we introduce a similarity loss that penalizes the
pairwise sample distance. We show that our system outperforms the
state-of-the-art in human motion prediction while it can predict diverse
multi-motion future trajectories with hip movements

associated with comorbidities such as depression and anxiety. Neuropathic Pain
(NP) is a common sub-type which is often caused due to nerve damage and has a
known pathophysiology. Another common sub-type is Fibromyalgia (FM) which is
described as musculoskeletal, diffuse pain that is widespread through the body.
The pathophysiology of FM is poorly understood, making it very hard to
diagnose. Standard medications and treatments for FM and NP differ from one
another and if misdiagnosed it can cause an increase in symptom severity. To
overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel framework, PainPoints, which
accurately detects the sub-type of pain and generates clinical notes via
summarizing the patient interviews. Specifically, PainPoints makes use of large
language models to perform sentence-level classification of the text obtained
from interviews of FM and NP patients with a reliable AUC of 0.83. Using a
sufficiency-based interpretability approach, we explain how the fine-tuned
model accurately picks up on the nuances that patients use to describe their
pain. Finally, we generate summaries of these interviews via expert
interventions by introducing a novel facet-based approach. PainPoints thus
enables practitioners to add/drop facets and generate a custom summary based on
the notion of ""facet-coverage"" which is also introduced in this work.

graph autoencoder-based models have proved useful in predicting many types of
node-pair interactions on large networks, including drug-drug, drug-target, and
target-target interactions. However, most existing approaches model the node's
latent spaces in which node distributions are rigid and disjoint; these
limitations hinder the methods from generating new links among pairs of nodes.
In this paper, we present the effectiveness of variational graph autoencoders
(VGAE) in modeling latent node representations on multimodal networks. Our
approach can produce flexible latent spaces for each node type of the
multimodal graph; the embeddings are used later for predicting links among node
pairs under different edge types. To further enhance the models' performance,
we suggest a new method that concatenates Morgan fingerprints, which capture
the molecular structures of each drug, with their latent embeddings before
preceding them to the decoding stage for link prediction. Our proposed model
shows competitive results on two multimodal networks: (1) a multi-graph
consisting of drug and protein nodes, and (2) a multi-graph consisting of drug
and cell line nodes. Our source code is publicly available at

that reliably directs AI behavior. Law-making and legal interpretation form a
computational engine that converts opaque human values into legible directives.
""Law Informs Code"" is the research agenda embedding legal knowledge and
reasoning in AI. Similar to how parties to a legal contract cannot foresee
every potential contingency of their future relationship, and legislators
cannot predict all the circumstances under which their proposed bills will be
applied, we cannot ex ante specify rules that provably direct good AI behavior.
Legal theory and practice have developed arrays of tools to address these
specification problems. For instance, legal standards allow humans to develop
shared understandings and adapt them to novel situations. In contrast to more
prosaic uses of the law (e.g., as a deterrent of bad behavior through the
threat of sanction), leveraged as an expression of how humans communicate their
goals, and what society values, Law Informs Code.
  We describe how data generated by legal processes (methods of law-making,
statutory interpretation, contract drafting, applications of legal standards,
legal reasoning, etc.) can facilitate the robust specification of inherently
vague human goals. This increases human-AI alignment and the local usefulness
of AI. Toward society-AI alignment, we present a framework for understanding
law as the applied philosophy of multi-agent alignment. Although law is partly
a reflection of historically contingent political power - and thus not a
perfect aggregation of citizen preferences - if properly parsed, its
distillation offers the most legitimate computational comprehension of societal
values available. If law eventually informs powerful AI, engaging in the
deliberative political process to improve law takes on even more meaning.

a linear relation in a finite-dimensional linear space ${\mathfrak H}$ (i.e.,
$A$ is a linear subspace of ${\mathfrak H} \times {\mathfrak H}$ and can be
considered as a multivalued linear operator), then there is a richer structure.
In addition to the classical Jordan chains (interpreted in the Cartesian
product ${\mathfrak H} \times {\mathfrak H}$), there occur three more classes
of chains: chains starting at zero (the chains for the eigenvalue infinity),
chains starting at zero and also ending at zero (the singular chains), and
chains with linearly independent entries (the shift chains). These four types
of chains give rise to a direct sum decomposition (a Jordan-like decomposition)
of the linear relation $A$. In this decomposition there is a completely
singular part that has the extended complex plane as eigenvalues; a usual
Jordan part that corresponds to the finite proper eigenvalues; a Jordan part
that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\infty$; and a multishift, i.e., a part
that has no eigenvalues at all. Furthermore, the Jordan-like decomposition
exhibits a certain uniqueness, closing a gap in earlier results. The
presentation is purely algebraic, only the structure of linear spaces is used.
Moreover, the presentation has a uniform character: each of the above types is
constructed via an appropriately chosen sequence of quotient spaces. The
dimensions of the spaces are the Weyr characteristics, which uniquely determine
the Jordan-like decomposition of the linear relation.

ignores magnetic field line chaos and requires an extremely large current

where $R_m$ is the magnetic Reynolds number. The time required for a general
natural evolution to take a smooth magnetic field into such a state is rarely
considered. Natural evolutions generally cause magnetic field lines to become
chaotic. A fast change in field line connections then arises on the timescale
defined by the evolution multiplied by a $\ln(R_m)$ factor, and the required
maximum current density scales as $\ln(R_m)$. Even when simulations support the

user growth and hinders updates for existing users. Thus, reducing the binary
size is important for application developers. Recent studies have shown the
possibility of using link-time code size optimizations by re-invoking certain
compiler optimizations on the linked intermediate representation of the
program. However, such methods often incur significant build time overhead and
require intrusive changes to the existing build pipeline.
  In this paper, we propose several novel optimization techniques that do not
require significant customization to the build pipeline and reduce binary size
with low build time overhead. As opposed to re-invoking the compiler during
link time, we perform true linker optimization directly as optimization passes
within the linker. This enables more optimization opportunities such as
pre-compiled libraries that prior work often could not optimize. We evaluate
our techniques on several commercial iOS applications including NewsFeedApp,
ShortVideoApp, and CollaborationSuiteApp, each with hundreds of millions of
daily active users. Our techniques on average achieve 18.4% binary size
reduction across the three commercial applications without any user-perceivable
performance degradations.

  Remote Keyless Entry Systems","24 pages, 5 figures Under submission to a journal","BlackHat USA 2022",,,"cs.CR cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Today's RKE systems implement disposable rolling codes, making every key fob
button press unique, effectively preventing simple replay attacks. However, a
prior attack called RollJam was proven to break all rolling code-based systems
in general. By a careful sequence of signal jamming, capturing, and replaying,
an attacker can become aware of the subsequent valid unlock signal that has not
been used yet. RollJam, however, requires continuous deployment indefinitely
until it is exploited. Otherwise, the captured signals become invalid if the
key fob is used again without RollJam in place. We introduce RollBack, a new
replay-and-resynchronize attack against most of today's RKE systems. In
particular, we show that even though the one-time code becomes invalid in
rolling code systems, replaying a few previously captured signals consecutively
can trigger a rollback-like mechanism in the RKE system. Put differently, the
rolling codes become resynchronized back to a previous code used in the past
from where all subsequent yet already used signals work again. Moreover, the
victim can still use the key fob without noticing any difference before and
after the attack. Unlike RollJam, RollBack does not necessitate jamming at all.
Furthermore, it requires signal capturing only once and can be exploited at any
time in the future as many times as desired. This time-agnostic property is
particularly attractive to attackers, especially in car-sharing/renting
scenarios where accessing the key fob is straightforward. However, while
RollJam defeats virtually any rolling code-based system, vehicles might have
additional anti-theft measures against malfunctioning key fobs, hence against
RollBack. Our ongoing analysis (covering Asian vehicle manufacturers for the
time being) against different vehicle makes and models has revealed that ~70%
of them are vulnerable to RollBack.

  Applications of Formal Methods, Verification and Validation (ISoLA 2022).
  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2010.04258",,,,"cs.SE cs.FL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Runtime enforcers can be used to ensure that running applications satisfy
desired correctness properties. Although runtime enforcers that are
correct-by-construction with respect to abstract behavioral models are
relatively easy to specify, the concrete software enforcers generated from
these specifications may easily introduce issues in the target application.
Indeed developers can generate test suites to verify the functional behavior of
the enforcers, for instance exploiting the same models used to specify them.
However, it remains challenging and tedious to verify the behavior of enforcers
in terms of non-functional performance characteristics. This paper describes a
practical approach to reveal runtime enforcers that may introduce
inefficiencies in the target application. The approach relies on a combination
of automatic test generation and runtime monitoring of multiple key performance
indicators. We designed our approach to reveal issues in four indicators for
mobile systems: responsiveness, launch time, memory, and energy consumption.
Experimental results show that our approach can detect performance issues that
might be introduced by automatically generated enforcers.

linear operators on a Hilbert space $\big(\mathcal{H}, \langle\cdot,
\cdot\rangle\big)$. Given a positive operator $A\in\B(\h)$, and a number
$\lambda\in [0,1]$, a seminorm ${\|\cdot\|}_{(A,\lambda)}$ is defined on the
set $\B_{A^{1/2}}(\h)$ of all operators in $\B(\h)$ having an
$A^{1/2}$-adjoint. The seminorm ${\|\cdot\|}_{(A,\lambda)}$ is a combination of
the sesquilinear form ${\langle \cdot, \cdot\rangle}_A$ and its induced
seminorm ${\|\cdot\|}_A$. A characterization of Birkhoff--James orthogonality
for operators with respect to the discussed seminorm is given. Moving $\lambda$
along the interval $[0,1]$, a wide spectrum of seminorms are obtained, having
the $A$-numerical radius $w_A(\cdot)$ at the beginning (associated with
$\lambda=0$) and the $A$-operator seminorm ${\|\cdot\|}_A$ at the end
(associated with $\lambda=1$). Moreover, if $A=I$ the identity operator, the
classical operator norm and numerical radius are obtained. Therefore, the
results in this paper are significant extensions and generalizations of known
results in this area.
