  error correction","Interspeech 2022",,,,"cs.SD cs.AI cs.LG eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The transcription quality of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems
degrades significantly when transcribing audios coming from unseen domains. We
propose an unsupervised error correction method for unsupervised ASR domain
adaption, aiming to recover transcription errors caused by domain mismatch.
Unlike existing correction methods that rely on transcribed audios for
training, our approach requires only unlabeled data of the target domains in
which a pseudo-labeling technique is applied to generate correction training
samples. To reduce over-fitting to the pseudo data, we also propose an
encoder-decoder correction model that can take into account additional
information such as dialogue context and acoustic features. Experiment results
show that our method obtains a significant word error rate (WER) reduction over
non-adapted ASR systems. The correction model can also be applied on top of
other adaptation approaches to bring an additional improvement of 10%
relatively.

encompass (finite or infinite) memory upper bounds.
  We prove that objectives admitting optimal strategies with
$\varepsilon$-memory less than $m$ (a memory that cannot be updated when
reading an $\varepsilon$-edge) are exactly those which admit well-founded
monotone universal graphs whose antichains have size bounded by $m$. We also
give a characterisation of chromatic memory by means of appropriate universal

  We illustrate the applicability of our framework by carrying out a few case

discuss general closure properties which follow from our results.

motivated an increasing shift towards more flexible representations of
age-specific period mortality trajectories at the cost of reduced
interpretability. While this perspective has led to successful predictive
strategies, the inclusion of interpretable structures in modeling of human
mortality can be, in fact, beneficial in improving forecasts. We pursue this
direction via a novel B-spline process with locally-adaptive dynamic
coefficients that outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting strategies by
explicitly incorporating core structures of period mortality trajectories
within an interpretable formulation that facilitates efficient computation via
closed-form Kalman filters and allows direct inference not only on age-specific
mortality trends but also on the associated rates of change across times. This
is obtained by modelling the age-specific death counts via an over-dispersed
Poisson log-normal model parameterized with a combination of B-spline bases
having dynamic coefficients that characterize time changes in mortality rates
through a set of carefully-defined stochastic differential equations. Such a
representation yields high flexibility, but also preserves tractability in
inference on dynamic changes of mortality patterns for different age profiles,
while accounting for shocks. As illustrated in applications to mortality data
from different countries, the proposed model yields more accurate forecasts
than state-of-the-art competitors and unveils substantial differences across
countries and age groups in mortality patterns, both in the past decades and
during the recent covid-19 pandemic.

(GANs) has been remarkably successful recently, there are still some challenges
in explicit control of features such as pose, expression, lighting, etc. Recent
methods achieve explicit control over 2D images by combining 2D generative
model and 3DMM. However, due to the lack of realism and clarity in texture
reconstruction by 3DMM, there is a domain gap between the synthetic image and
the rendered image of 3DMM. Since rendered 3DMM images contain facial region
only without the background, directly computing the loss between these two
domains is not ideal and the resultant trained model will be biased. In this
study, we propose to explicitly edit the latent space of the pretrained

  This line of research was initiated by a question of Haight and Weizs\""aker
concerning almost everywhere convergence properties of series of the form
$\sum_{n=1}^{{\infty}}f(nx)$. A more general, additive version of this problem
is the following:
  Suppose $\Lambda$ is a discrete infinite set of nonnegative real numbers. We
say that $ {\Lambda}$ is of type 1 if the series
$s(x)=\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda}f(x+\lambda)$ satisfies a zero-one law. This
means that for any non-negative measurable $f: {{\mathbb R}}\to [0,+ {\infty})$
either the convergence set $C(f, {\Lambda})=\{x: s(x)<+ {\infty} \}= {{\mathbb
R}}$ modulo sets of Lebesgue zero, or its complement the divergence set $D(f,
{\Lambda})=\{x: s(x)=+ {\infty} \}= {{\mathbb R}}$ modulo sets of measure zero.
  If $ {\Lambda}$ is not of type 1 we say that $ {\Lambda}$ is of type 2.
  The exact characterization of type $1$ and type $2$ sets is still not known.

several joint papers written at the beginning with J-P. Kahane and D. Mauldin,
later with B. Hanson, B. Maga and G. V\'ertesy.

developers, which is becoming a source of consternation as they struggle to
choose one over the others. For example, there are at least ten frameworks
available to developers for developing web applications, posing a conundrum in
selecting the best one that meets their needs. As a result, developers are
continuously searching for all of the benefits and drawbacks of each API,
framework, tool, and so on. One of the typical approaches is to examine all of
the features through official documentation and discussion. This approach is
time-consuming, often makes it difficult to determine which aspects are the
most important to a particular developer and whether a particular aspect is
important to the community at large. In this paper, we have used a benchmark
API aspects dataset (Opiner) collected from StackOverflow posts and observed
how Transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and XLNet) perform in
detecting software aspects in textual developer discussion with respect to the
baseline Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. Through extensive experimentation,
we have found that transformer models improve the performance of baseline SVM
for most of the aspects, i.e., `Performance', `Security', `Usability',
`Documentation', `Bug', `Legal', `OnlySentiment', and `Others'. However, the
models fail to apprehend some of the aspects (e.g., `Community' and
`Potability') and their performance varies depending on the aspects. Also,
larger architectures like XLNet are ineffective in interpreting software
aspects compared to smaller architectures like DistilBERT.

the topological notion of nowhere density in a suitable topological space. I
argue that the short-run falsifiability of a hypothesis is in turn
characterized by the VC finiteness of the hypothesis. Crucially, VC finite
hypotheses correspond precisely to definable sets in NIP structures. I end the
chapter by giving rigorous foundations for Mayo's conception of severe testing
by way of a combinatorial, non-probabilistic notion of surprise. VC finite

this question is tied up with whether the theory in question is axiomatizable

in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomous driving. Skills learned
from expert demonstrations or designed for specific tasks can benefit the
exploration, but they are usually costly-collected, unbalanced/sub-optimal, or
failing to transfer to diverse tasks. However, human drivers can adapt to
varied driving tasks without demonstrations by taking efficient and structural
explorations in the entire skill space rather than a limited space with
task-specific skills. Inspired by the above fact, we propose an RL algorithm
exploring all feasible motion skills instead of a limited set of task-specific
and object-centric skills. Without demonstrations, our method can still perform
well in diverse tasks. First, we build a task-agnostic and ego-centric (TaEc)
motion skill library in a pure motion perspective, which is diverse enough to
be reusable in different complex tasks. The motion skills are then encoded into
a low-dimension latent skill space, in which RL can do exploration efficiently.
Validations in various challenging driving scenarios demonstrate that our
proposed method, TaEc-RL, outperforms its counterparts significantly in
learning efficiency and task performance.

  https://github.com/Jiamian-Wang/S2-transformer-HSI",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The technology of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) records the visual information
upon long-range-distributed spectral wavelengths. A representative
hyperspectral image acquisition procedure conducts a 3D-to-2D encoding by the
coded aperture snapshot spectral imager (CASSI) and requires a software decoder
for the 3D signal reconstruction. By observing this physical encoding
procedure, two major challenges stand in the way of a high-fidelity
reconstruction. (i) To obtain 2D measurements, CASSI dislocates multiple
channels by disperser-titling and squeezes them onto the same spatial region,
yielding an entangled data loss. (ii) The physical coded aperture leads to a
masked data loss by selectively blocking the pixel-wise light exposure. To
tackle these challenges, we propose a spatial-spectral (S^2-) Transformer
network with a mask-aware learning strategy. First, we simultaneously leverage
spatial and spectral attention modeling to disentangle the blended information
in the 2D measurement along both two dimensions. A series of Transformer
structures are systematically designed to fully investigate the spatial and
spectral informative properties of the hyperspectral data. Second, the masked
pixels will induce higher prediction difficulty and should be treated
differently from unmasked ones. Thereby, we adaptively prioritize the loss
penalty attributing to the mask structure by inferring the pixel-wise
reconstruction difficulty upon the mask-encoded prediction. We theoretically
discusses the distinct convergence tendencies between masked/unmasked regions
of the proposed learning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrates that the
proposed method achieves superior reconstruction performance. Additionally, we
empirically elaborate the behaviour of spatial and spectral attentions under
the proposed architecture, and comprehensively examine the impact of the
mask-aware learning.

simulations of magnetically arrested disks (MADs) around non-spinning ($a_*=0$)

the mass accretion rate is decreased with time such that we sample
Eddington-scaled rates over the range $3 \gtrsim
\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm{Edd}}\gtrsim 0.3$. For the non-spinning BH model, the
total and radiative efficiencies increase as the accretion rate decreases,
varying over the range $\eta_{\rm{tot}}\sim9-16\%$ and
$\eta_{\rm{rad}}\sim6-12\%$, respectively. This model shows very little jet
activity. In contrast, the spinning BH model has a strong relativistic jet
powered by spin energy extracted from the BH. The jet power declines with
accretion rate such that $\eta_{\rm{jet}}\sim 18-39\%$ while the total and
radiative efficiencies are $\eta_{\rm{tot}}\sim 64-100\%$ and
$\eta_{\rm{rad}}\sim 45-79\%$, respectively. We confirm that mildly
sub-Eddington disks can extract substantial power from a spinning BH, provided
they are in the MAD state. The jet profile out to $100\, GM/c^2$ is roughly
parabolic with a power-law index of $k\approx0.43-0.53$ during the
sub-Eddington evolution. Both models show significant variability in the
outgoing radiation which is likely associated with episodes of magnetic flux
eruptions. The $a_*=0.9$ model shows semi-regular variations with a period of
$\sim2000\, GM/c^3$ over the final $\sim10,000\, GM/c^3$ of the simulation,
which suggests that magnetic flux eruptions may be an important source of
quasi-periodic variability. For the simulated accretion rates, the $a_*=0$
model is spinning up while the $a_*=0.9$ model is spinning down.
Spinup-spindown equilibrium of the BH will likely be achieved at $0.5 <
a_{*,{\rm{eq}}} < 0.6$, assuming continuous accretion in the MAD state.

on a subject-specific basis requires quantifying uncertainties in data,
biophysical models of tumor growth, and spatial heterogeneity of tumor and host
tissue. This work introduces a Bayesian framework to calibrate the spatial
distribution of the parameters within a tumor growth model to quantitative
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and demonstrates its implementation in a
pre-clinical model of glioma. The framework leverages an atlas-based brain
segmentation of grey and white matter to establish subject-specific priors and
tunable spatial dependencies of the model parameters in each region. Using this
framework, the tumor-specific parameters are calibrated from quantitative MRI
measurements early in the course of tumor development in four rats and used to
predict the spatial development of the tumor at later times. The results
suggest that the tumor model, calibrated by animal-specific imaging data at one
time point, can accurately predict tumor shapes with a Dice coefficient > 0.89.
However, the reliability of the predicted volume and shape of tumors strongly
relies on the number of earlier imaging time points used for calibrating the
model. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the ability to determine
the uncertainty in the inferred tissue heterogeneity and the model predicted
tumor shape.

set of criteria, we classify objects by their SEDs as protostars, pre-ms
sequence stars with disks, and galaxies. A total of 172 protostars are found in
Aquila, tightly concentrated in the molecular filaments that thread the clouds.
Of these, 71 (42\%) are Class 0 protostars, 54 (31\%) are Class I protostars,
43 (25\%) are flat-spectrum protostars, and 4 (2\%) are Class II sources. Ten
of the Class 0 protostars are young PACS Bright Red Sources similar to those
discovered in Orion. We compare the SEDs to a grid of radiative transfer models
to constrain the luminosities, envelope densities, and envelope masses of the
protostars. A comparison of the eHOPS-Aquila to the HOPS protostars in Orion
finds that the protostellar luminosity functions in the two star-forming
regions are statistically indistinguishable, the bolometric
temperatures/envelope masses of eHOPS-Aquila protostars are shifted to cooler
temperatures/higher masses, and the eHOPS-Aquila protostars do not show the
decline in luminosity with evolution found in Orion. We briefly discuss whether
these differences are due to biases between the samples, diverging star

complex human activity, but it lacks the interpretability of demographic data.
In this paper, we study a privacy-enhanced dataset of the mobility visitation
patterns of 1.2 million people to 1.1 million places in 11 metro areas in the
U.S. to detect the latent mobility behaviors and lifestyles in the largest
American cities. Despite the considerable complexity of mobility visitations,
we found that lifestyles can be automatically decomposed into only 12 latent
interpretable activity behaviors on how people combine shopping, eating,
working, or using their free time. Rather than describing individuals with a
single lifestyle, we find that city dwellers' behavior is a mixture of those
behaviors. Those detected latent activity behaviors are equally present across
cities and cannot be fully explained by main demographic features. Finally, we
find those latent behaviors are associated with dynamics like experienced
income segregation, transportation, or healthy behaviors in cities, even after
controlling for demographic features. Our results signal the importance of
complementing traditional census data with activity behaviors to understand
urban dynamics.

as one of the key enabling property thanks to its abundant bandwidth. However,
the ultra-wide bandwidth in THz causes beam-split phenomenon due to the use of
a single analog beamformer (AB). Specifically, beam-split makes different
subcarriers to observe distinct directions since the same AB is adopted for all
subcarriers. Previous works mostly employ additional hardware components, e.g.,
time-delayer networks to mitigate beam-split by realizing virtual
subcarrier-dependent ABs. This paper introduces an efficient and unified
approach, called beam-split-aware (BSA) hybrid beamforming. In particular,
instead of virtually generating subcarrier-dependent ABs, a single AB is used
and the effect of beam-split is computed and passed into the digital
beamformers, which are subcarrier-dependent while maximizing spectral
efficiency. Hence, the proposed BSA approach effectively mitigates the impact
of beam-split and it can be applied to any hybrid beamforming architecture.
Manifold optimization and orthogonal matching pursuit techniques are considered
for the evaluation of the proposed approach in multi-user scenario. Numerical
simulations show that significant performance improvement can be achieved as
compared to the conventional techniques.

take into account the relativistic phenomena to show that the temporally and
spatially local Doppler effects can filter and amplify the electromagnetic
signal, tailoring the $k-$ and $\omega-$content of the transients. It is shown
using the Doppler factor and the change of the distance between neighbor
characteristics that the dynamical movement of the boundaries can lead to
condensated characteristics resulting in field amplification or dilution of the
characteristics resulting in the attenuation of the signal. In the case of
periodically moving mirrors the field distribution is shown that asymptotically
leads to exponentially growing delta-like wave packets at discrete points of

mechanical vibrations can not exceed that of light. The theoretical analysis is

necessary to acquire multi-modality images for diagnosis and treatment such as
radiotherapy planning. However, multi-modality imaging is not only costly but
also introduces misalignment between MRI and CT images. To address this
challenge, computational conversion is a viable approach between MRI and CT
images, especially from MRI to CT images. In this paper, we propose to use an
emerging deep learning framework called diffusion and score-matching models in
this context. Specifically, we adapt denoising diffusion probabilistic and
score-matching models, use four different sampling strategies, and compare
their performance metrics with that using a convolutional neural network and a
generative adversarial network model. Our results show that the diffusion and
score-matching models generate better synthetic CT images than the CNN and GAN
models. Furthermore, we investigate the uncertainties associated with the
diffusion and score-matching networks using the Monte-Carlo method, and improve
the results by averaging their Monte-Carlo outputs. Our study suggests that
diffusion and score-matching models are powerful to generate high quality
images conditioned on an image obtained using a complementary imaging modality,
analytically rigorous with clear explainability, and highly competitive with
CNNs and GANs for image synthesis.

in generating fluent text. LLMs have also shown an alarming tendency to
reproduce social biases, for example stereotypical associations between gender
and occupation or race and criminal behavior. Like race and gender, morality is
an important social variable; our moral biases affect how we receive other
people and their arguments. I anticipate that the apparent moral capabilities
of LLMs will play an important role in their effects on the human social
environment. This work investigates whether LLMs reproduce the moral biases
associated with political groups, a capability I refer to as moral mimicry. I
explore this hypothesis in GPT-3, a 175B-parameter language model based on the
Transformer architecture, using tools from Moral Foundations Theory to measure
the moral content in text generated by the model following prompting with
liberal and conservative political identities. The results demonstrate that
large language models are indeed moral mimics; when prompted with a political
identity, GPT-3 generates text reflecting the corresponding moral biases. Moral
mimicry could contribute to fostering understanding between social groups via
moral reframing. Worryingly, it could also reinforce polarized views,
exacerbating existing social challenges. I hope that this work encourages
further investigation of the moral mimicry capability, including how to
leverage it for social good and minimize its risks.

the numerical solutions are Dirac measures. As such, one immediately faces the
difficulty in explaining the multiplication of two measures. This suggests that

the difficulty. One is to adopt the Discrete-Then-Optimize technique and
conduct the full optimization on the algebraic system, avoiding the Dirac

solvers separately for both forward and adjoint problems, we recycle the
samples in the forward simulation in the adjoint solver. This frames the
adjoint solution as a test function, and hence allows a rigorous convergence

shifts spin-dependent band edges and modifies the total band gap. We further

Modifying the carbon black slurry formulation with the addition of a nonionic

investigation reveals that the carbon black suspensions behave like colloidal
gels. Sedimentation kinetics of the process was measured by tracking the height
of the particle bed over time in a cuvette using a custom camera set-up. The
sedimentation dynamics here clearly resembled that of a gel collapse. At short
times we observe fast sedimentation associated with structural collapse of the
gel and at long times very slow sedimentation associated with compaction of the
sediment. Addition of a nonionic surfactant (Triton X-100) to the solvent above
CMC at $\alpha$ (= c$_{surf.}$/c$_{CB}$) $<$ 0.7 improves particle dispersion
and increases gel elasticity. However, for $\alpha >$ 0.7 leads to the

  The conditional edge-fault-tolerance about the SM-$ \lambda$ property of $G$,

SM-$\lambda$ for any edge subset $F$ with $|F|\leq m$ and $\delta(G-F)\geq r$,

photoexcitation promotes valence electrons from Si substrate to empty surface

drives coherently the structural transition. We illustrate that after the
structural transition, the component of these surface bands occurs a switch
among different covalent In bonds, causing a rotation of the interatomic forces
by about {\pi}/6 and thus quickly damping the oscillations in feature CDW
modes. These findings provide a deeper understanding of photoinduced phase

remove correlations among pixels before quantization and entropy coding, e.g.,
the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and intra predictions, adopted by modern
image coding standards. We present a new method to remove pixel correlations.
First, by decomposing correlations into long- and short-range correlations, we
represent long-range correlations in coarser grids due to their smoothness,
thus leading to a multi-grid (MG) coding architecture. Second, we show that
short-range correlations can be effectively coded by a suite of vector
quantizers (VQs). Along this line, we argue the effectiveness of VQs of very
large block sizes and present a convenient way to implement them. It is shown
by experimental results that MGBVQ offers excellent rate-distortion (RD)
performance, which is comparable with existing image coders, at much lower
complexity. Besides, it provides a progressive coded bitstream.

(hereafter J1123), is in a single-lined spectroscopic binary containing an
optically visible M star. The star's large radial velocity variation and
ellipsoidal variations indicate a relatively massive unseen companion.
Utilizing follow-up spectroscopy from the Palomar 200-inch telescope and
high-precision photometry from TESS, we measure a companion mass of
$1.24_{-0.03}^{+0.03}~M_{\odot}$. Main-sequence stars with this mass are ruled
out, leaving a NS or a massive white dwarf (WD). Although a massive WD cannot
be ruled out, the lack of UV excess radiation from the companion supports the
NS hypothesis. Deep radio observations with FAST yielded no detections of
either pulsed or persistent emission. J1123 is not detected in numerous X-ray
and gamma-ray surveys. These non-detections suggest that the NS candidate is
not presently accreting and pulsing. Our work exemplifies the capability of

control framework which can describe realism well expressed as the game based
control system (GBCS), was obtained in 2019, which, unfortunately, is not graph
theoretically verifiable, and the regulator control input is assumed to be
zero. However, based on a new established notion, strategy matrix, we propose a
graph theory condition to judge the controllability of GBCS, instead of using
algebraic conditions for complex mathematical calculations. More specifically,
to tackle these issues, one needs to study the expression of Nash equilibrium
actions when regulators control is not zero first. Based on this expression,
the general formula of game controllability matrix is obtained, which provides
theoretical support for studying the essential influence of topology on game
based control system. The general formula is always affected by the specific
matrix strategy matrix, composed of Nash equilibrium actions, and the matrix
can not only be obtained by matrix calculation, but also can be directly
written through the topology, which is the specific influence of the topology
on the GBCS. Finally, we obtain the result of judging the controllability of
the system directly according to the topological structure, and put forward the
conjecture that there is no limitation of equivalent partition in GBCS.
Arguably, this is a surprising conjecture on the equivalent partition of
graphs, because only the limitation of equivalent partition in fivenode graphs

  Detection",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anomaly detection has recently gained increasing attention in the field of
computer vision, likely due to its broad set of applications ranging from
product fault detection on industrial production lines and impending event
detection in video surveillance to finding lesions in medical scans. Regardless
of the domain, anomaly detection is typically framed as a one-class
classification task, where the learning is conducted on normal examples only.
An entire family of successful anomaly detection methods is based on learning
to reconstruct masked normal inputs (e.g. patches, future frames, etc.) and
exerting the magnitude of the reconstruction error as an indicator for the
abnormality level. Unlike other reconstruction-based methods, we present a
novel self-supervised masked convolutional transformer block (SSMCTB) that
comprises the reconstruction-based functionality at a core architectural level.
The proposed self-supervised block is extremely flexible, enabling information
masking at any layer of a neural network and being compatible with a wide range
of neural architectures. In this work, we extend our previous self-supervised
predictive convolutional attentive block (SSPCAB) with a 3D masked
convolutional layer, as well as a transformer for channel-wise attention.
Furthermore, we show that our block is applicable to a wider variety of tasks,
adding anomaly detection in medical images and thermal videos to the previously
considered tasks based on RGB images and surveillance videos. We exhibit the
generality and flexibility of SSMCTB by integrating it into multiple
state-of-the-art neural models for anomaly detection, bringing forth empirical
results that confirm considerable performance improvements on five benchmarks:
MVTec AD, BRATS, Avenue, ShanghaiTech, and Thermal Rare Event. We release our

between a specialist predator, a generalist predator, and their common prey in

operates on a faster timescale, while the specialist and generalist predators
operate on slow and superslow timescales respectively. Treating the predation
efficiency of the generalist predator as the primary varying parameter and the
proportion of its diet formed by the prey species under study as the secondary
parameter, we obtain a host of rich and interesting dynamics, including
relaxation oscillations, mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs), subcritical elliptic
bursting patterns, torus canards, and mixed-type torus canards. By grouping the
timescales into two classes and using the timescale separation between classes,
we apply one-fast/two-slow and two-fast/one-slow analysis techniques to gain
insights about the dynamics. Using the geometric properties and flows of the
singular subsystems, in combination with bifurcation analysis and numerical
continuation of the full system, we classify the oscillatory dynamics and
discuss the transitions from one type of dynamics to the other. The types of
oscillatory patterns observed in this model are novel in population models
featuring three-timescales; some of which qualitatively resemble natural cycles
in small mammals and insects. Furthermore, oscillatory dynamics displaying
torus canards, mixed-type torus canards, and MMOs experiencing a delayed loss
of stability near one of the invariant sheets of the self-intersecting critical
manifold before getting attracted to the adjacent attracting sheet of the
critical manifold have not been previously reported in three-timescale models.

discovery of a gradually-brightening thermal X-ray emission found in Chandra
data of Tycho's SNR obtained during 2000--2015. The emission exhibits a
knot-like feature (Knot1) with a diameter of $\simeq0.04$~pc located in the
northwestern limb, where we also find localized H$\alpha$ filaments in an
optical image taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2008. The model with the
solar abundance reproduces the spectra of Knot1, suggesting that Knot1
originates from interstellar medium; this is the first detection of thermal
X-ray emission from swept-up gas found in Tycho's SNR. Our spectral analysis
indicates that the electron temperature of Knot1 has increased from $\sim0.30$
keV to $\sim0.69$ keV within the period between 2000 and 2015. These results
lead us to ascribe the time-variable emission to a small dense clump recently
heated by the forward shock at the location of Knot1. The electron-to-proton
temperature ratio immediately downstream the shock ($\beta_{0}\equiv T_e/T_p$)
is constrained to be $m_e/m_p\leq\beta_{0}\leq0.15$ to reproduce the data,

several correlation-driven behaviours with twisted bilayer graphene. In
general, the van Hove singularities (VHSs) can be used as a proxy of the
tendency for correlated behaviours. In this paper, we adopt an atomistic method
by combining tight-binding method with the semi-classical molecular dynamics to
investigate the electronic structures of twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) with
two independent twist angles. The two independent twist angles can lead to the
interference of the moir\'e patterns forming a variety of
commensurate/incommensurate complex supermoir\'e patterns. In particular, the
lattice relaxation, twist angle and angle disorder effects on the VHS are
discussed. We find that the lattice relaxation significantly influence the
position and magnitude of the VHSs. In the supermoir\'e TTG, the moir\'e
interference provides constructive or destructive effects depending on the
relative twist angle. By modulating the two independent twist angles, novel
superstructures, for instance, the Kagome-like lattice, could constructed via
the moir\'e pattern. Moreover, we demonstrate that a slight change in twist
angles (angle disorder) provides a significant suppression of the peak of the
VHSs. Apart from the moir\'e length, the evolution of the VHSs and the LDOS
mapping in real space could be used to identify the twist angles in the
complicated TTG. In practice, our work could provide a guide for exploring the
flat band behaviours in the supermoir\'e TTG experimentally.

the determination of $J_c$ is increasingly sensitive with growing disorder of

appropriate $J_c$, where the values of $p$ are at a maximum, increase with
decreasing $\Delta_s$. Finally, the appropriate value of $J_c$ is shown to be
observed at approximately $\Delta_c/\Delta_s=0.25$ and $2.1 E_g$ in the ordered

spins are polarized as they are transported through chiral molecules, and the
spin polarization depends on the handedness of the chiral molecule. In this
study, we show that spin selectivity can be realized in achiral materials by
coupling electrons to a single mode of a chiral optical cavity. By
investigating spin-dependent electron transport using the nonequilibrium
Green's function approach, the spin polarization in a two-terminal setup is
demonstrated to approach unity if the rate of dephasing is sufficiently small
and the average chemical potential of the two leads is within an appropriate
range of values, which is narrow because of the high frequency of the cavity
mode. To obtain a wider range of energies for a large spin polarization, we
propose to combine the CISS in chiral molecules with the light-matter
interactions. For demonstration, the spin polarization of electrons transported

evaluated.

challenging computer vision tasks. Since conventional FER schemes do not
explicitly address the inter-identity variation of facial expressions, their

proposes to quantify the inter-identity variation by utilizing pairs of similar
expressions explored through a specific matching process. We formulate the
identity matching process as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem. Specifically,
to find pairs of similar expressions from different identities, we define the
inter-feature similarity as a transportation cost. Then, optimal identity
matching to find the optimal flow with minimum transportation cost is performed
by Sinkhorn-Knopp iteration. The proposed matching method is not only easy to
plug in to other models, but also requires only acceptable computational
overhead. Extensive simulations prove that the proposed FER method improves the
PCC/CCC performance by up to 10\% or more compared to the runner-up on wild

consider the recently proposed modified symmetric teleparallel theory of

scalar. In this paper, motivated by several papers in the literature, we assume
the power-law form of the function $% f\left( Q\right) $ as $f\left( Q\right)
=\alpha Q^{n+1}+\beta $ (where $% \alpha $, $\beta $, and $n$ are free model

Further, to add constraints to the field equations we assume the deceleration
parameter form as a divergence-free parametrization. Then, we discuss the
behavior of various cosmographic and cosmological parameters such as the jerk,
snap, lerk, $Om$ diagnostic, cosmic energy density, isotropic pressure, and
equation of state (EoS) parameter with a check of the violation of the strong

the convolution-type nonlocal potential $\Phi(x)=(U\ast \rho)(x), ~x \in
{\mathbb R^d}$, where the convolution kernel $U(x)$ might be singular at the
origin and/or far-field and the density $\rho(x)$ is smooth and fast-decaying.
In KTM, in order to capture the Fourier integrand's oscillations that is
brought by the kernel truncation, one needs to carry out a zero-padding of the
density, which means a larger physical computation domain and a finer mesh in
the Fourier space by duality. The empirical fourfold zero-padding [ Vico et al
J. Comput. Phys. (2016) ] puts a heavy burden on memory requirement especially
for higher dimension problems. In this paper, we derive the optimal
zero-padding factor, that is, $\sqrt{d}+1$, for the first time together with a
rigorous proof. The memory cost is greatly reduced to a small fraction, i.e.,
$(\frac{\sqrt{d}+1}{4})^d$, of what is needed in the original fourfold
algorithm. For example, in the precomputation step, a double-precision
computation on a $256^3$ grid requires a minimum $3.4$ Gb memory with the
optimal threefold zero-padding, while the fourfold algorithm requires around
$8$ Gb where the reduction factor is $\frac{37}{64}\approx \frac{3}{5}$. Then,
we present the error estimates of the potential and density in $d$ dimension.
Next, we re-investigate the optimal zero-padding factor for the anisotropic
density. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to confirm the
accuracy, efficiency, optimal zero-padding factor for the anisotropic density,
together with some applications to different types of nonlocal potential,
including the 1D/2D/3D Poisson, 2D Coulomb, quasi-2D/3D Dipole-Dipole

strobed image of the stresses and particle positions appears static. In the
present work, we report further analyses of data from those experiments to
characterize both global and local responses of ultrastable states within a
shear cycle, not just the strobed dynamics. We find that ultrastable states
follow a power-law relation between shear modulus and pressure with an exponent
$\beta\approx 0.5$, reminiscent of critical scaling laws near jamming. We also
examine the evolution of contact forces measured using photoelasticimetry. We
find that there are two types of contacts: non-persistent contacts that
reversibly open and close; and persistent contacts that never open \yiqiu{and
display no measurable sliding}. We show that the non-persistent contacts make a
non-negligible contribution to the emergent shear modulus. We also analyze the
spatial correlations of the stress tensor and compare them to the predictions

Charge Theory of Granular mechanics and dynamics (VCTG) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125,

  We report conceptually on a proof that shows that Milner's system is
complete, by motivating, illustrating, and describing all of its main steps. We
substantially refine the completeness proof by Grabmayer and Fokkink (2020) for
the restriction of Milner's system to `1-free' regular expressions. As a
crucial complication we recognize that process graphs with empty-step
transitions that satisfy the layered loop-existence/elimination property LLEE
are not closed under bisimulation collapse (unlike process graphs with LLEE
that only have proper-step transitions). We circumnavigate this obstacle by
defining a LLEE-preserving `crystallization procedure' for such process graphs.
By that we obtain `near-collapsed' process graphs with LLEE whose strongly
connected components are either collapsed or of `twin-crystal' shape. Such

its kinetic term. This novelty generalizes the linear dependence of the gauge
kinetic function on $\phi$, commonly adopted in the literature. The interaction
naturally induces a time variation of the fine-structure constant that can be
formulated within a disformally coupled framework. Through a suitable
parametrization of the scalar field and the coupling function, we test the
model against observations sensitive to the variation of $\alpha$. We undertake
a Bayesian analysis to infer the free parameters with data from Earth based,
astrophysical and early Universe experiments. We find that the evolution of
$\alpha$ is specific to each cosmological era and slows down at late times when
dark energy accelerates the Universe. While the most stringent bound on the
interaction is obtained from atomic clocks measurements, the quasars provide a
constraint consistent with weak equivalence principle tests. This promising
model is to be further tested with upcoming and more precise astrophysical
measurements, such as those of the ESPRESSO spectrograph.

monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission
electron microscope, we reveal momentum-transfer-dependent lattice vibration
behavior at an artificial h-10BN/h-11BN heterostructure with sub-unit-cell
resolution. We find the vibrational energy changes across the isotopic
interface gradually, featuring a wide transition regime, which suggests strong
delocalization of the out-of-plane optical phonons at the interface. In
addition, we identify phonons near the Brillouin zone center have a transition
regime ~3.34 nm (10 atomic layers), whereas phonons at the Brillouin zone
boundary transition in ~1.66 nm (5 atomic layers). We propose that the
isotope-induced charge effect at the interface accounts for the distinct
delocalization behavior. Moreover, intra-atomic layer variation of vibration
energy is also sensitive to the momentum transfer, thus at the interface it
depends on both of momentum transfer and mass change. The revealed lattice
vibration behavior at an isotopic interface provides new insights to understand
the isotopic effects on properties in natural materials.

set for the CNN classifier based on the DenseNet-201. Because it is tightly
overlapped with the Galaxy Zoo 2 (GZ2) sample, we use these annotated data as
the training data set to classify galaxies into 34 detailed features. In the
presence of a pronounced difference of visual parameters between galaxies from
the GZ2 training data set and galaxies without known morphological parameters,
we applied novel procedures, which allowed us for the first time to get rid of
this difference for smaller and fainter SDSS galaxies.
  We describe in detail the adversarial validation technique as well as how we
managed the optimal train-test split of galaxies from the training data set. We
have also found optimal galaxy image transformations to increase the classifier
generalization ability. It can be considered as another way to improve the
human bias for those galaxy images that had a poor vote classification in the
GZ project. Such an approach, likely auto-immunization, when the CNN classifier
trained on very good images is able to retrain bad images from the same
homogeneous sample, can be considered co-planar to other methods of combating
the human bias.
  The accuracy of CNN classifier is in the range of 83.3-99.4 percent depending

bulges embedded in dark matter (DM) halos, including the effects of pressure
support. The fraction of dark to total matter within the disk effective radius
($R_e ~ 5 kpc$), $f_DM (R_e)=V_{DM}^2 (R_e)/V_{circ}^2 (R_e)$, decreases with
redshift: At z~1 (z~2) the median DM fraction is $0.38\pm 0.23$ ($0.27\pm
0.18$), and a third (half) of all galaxies are ""maximal"" disks with $f_{DM}
(R_e)<0.28$. Dark matter fractions correlate inversely with the baryonic
surface density, and the low DM fractions require a flattened, or cored, inner
DM density distribution. At z~2 there is ~40% less dark matter mass on average
within $R_e$ compared to expected values based on cosmological stellar-mass
halo-mass relations. The DM deficit is more evident at high star formation rate
(SFR) surface densities ($\Sigma_{SFR}>2.5 M_{\odot} yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}$) and
galaxies with massive bulges ($M_{bulge}>10^{10} M_{\odot}$). A combination of
stellar or active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, and/or heating due to
dynamical friction, either from satellite accretion or clump migration, may
drive the DM from cuspy into cored mass distributions. The observations
plausibly indicate an efficient build-up of massive bulges and central black

While perturbatively based, the core of parquet and allied models is a set of
strongly coupled nonlinear integral equations for all-order scattering; tightly
constrained by crossing symmetry, they are nevertheless heuristic. Within a
formalism due to Kraichnan, we present a Hamiltonian analysis of fermionic
parquet's structure. The shape of its constitutive equations follows naturally
from the resulting canonical description. We discuss the affinity between the
derived conserving scattering amplitude and that of standard parquet. Whereas
the Hamiltonian-derived model amplitude is microscopically conserving, it
cannot preserve crossing symmetry. The parquet amplitude and its refinements
preserve crossing symmetry, yet cannot safeguard conservation at any stage.
Which amplitude should be used depends on physics rather than on theoretically
ideal completeness.

further investigation is required to understand the cause of the suppression.
The increase in cloud extent with $f_\mathrm{sed}$ results in a cooler planet
due to a higher albedo, causing the atmosphere to contract. This also results
in a reduced day-night contrast seen in the phase curves, although the
introduction of cloud still results in a reduction of the phase offset. We

with the rotational period. They are generally slow rotators, with rotational
periods exceeding half a day, except for the late B-type star HD 60431, which
has an unusually short rotational period of 0.4755 days. As slow rotation is
deemed a necessary criterion for the establishment of chemical peculiarities,
this characteristic renders HD 60431 a special object that might offer valuable
insight into, and constraints on, the formation and evolution of CP2 stars. Our
study aims at analysing the light variability, deriving atmospheric abundances,
and determining detailed physical parameters of HD 60431 to confirm its status
as the CP2 star with the shortest known rotational period, with special
emphasis on the rotational period evolution. Photometric indices and
high-resolution spectroscopy were employed to derive physical parameters,
evolutionary status, and atmospheric abundances of our target star. A light
variability study was carried out using combined sets of photometric data from
ground- and space-based facilities. A circularly polarised spectrum was
employed to check the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field in the star.
With an age of only 10 Myr, HD 60431 is situated close to the zero-age main
sequence and a member of the open cluster NGC 2547 in the Vela OB2 complex. We
confirm its status as a classical late B-type CP2 star showing strong
overabundances of Mg (1.8 dex), Si (1.9 dex), Ca (1.6 dex), Ti (2.2 dex), and
Fe (1.8 dex). No conclusive evidence for the presence of a strong magnetic
field was found in the available spectroscopic data. The available photometric
time series data confirm the short rotational period and indicate a slight
secular increase of the rotational period of P' = 7.5(6) ms/yr. HD 60431 is
indeed the CP2 star with the shortest known rotational period.

  Presentation Attack Detection and Reconstruction","13 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The technology of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to fingerprint imaging
opens up a new research potential for fingerprint recognition owing to its
ability to capture depth information of the skin layers. Developing robust and
high security Automated Fingerprint Recognition Systems (AFRSs) are possible if
the depth information can be fully utilized. However, in existing studies,
Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) and subsurface fingerprint reconstruction
based on depth information are treated as two independent branches, resulting
in high computation and complexity of AFRS building.Thus, this paper proposes a
uniform representation model for OCT-based fingerprint PAD and subsurface
fingerprint reconstruction. Firstly, we design a novel semantic segmentation
network which only trained by real finger slices of OCT-based fingerprints to
extract multiple subsurface structures from those slices (also known as
B-scans). The latent codes derived from the network are directly used to
effectively detect the PA since they contain abundant subsurface biological
information, which is independent with PA materials and has strong robustness
for unknown PAs. Meanwhile, the segmented subsurface structures are adopted to
reconstruct multiple subsurface 2D fingerprints. Recognition can be easily
achieved by using existing mature technologies based on traditional 2D
fingerprints. Extensive experiments are carried on our own established
database, which is the largest public OCT-based fingerprint database with 2449
volumes. In PAD task, our method can improve 0.33% Acc from the
state-of-the-art method. For reconstruction performance, our method achieves
the best performance with 0.834 mIOU and 0.937 PA. By comparing with the
recognition performance on surface 2D fingerprints, the effectiveness of our
proposed method on high quality subsurface fingerprint reconstruction is
further proved.

evolving. The use of supervised deep learning procedures for denoising of
seismic datasets often results in poor performance: this is due to the lack of
noise-free field data to act as training targets and the large difference in
characteristics between synthetic and field datasets. Self-supervised,
blind-spot networks typically overcome these limitation by training directly on
the raw, noisy data. However, such networks often rely on a random noise
assumption, and their denoising capabilities quickly decrease in the presence
of even minimally-correlated noise. Extending from blind-spots to blind-masks
can efficiently suppress coherent noise along a specific direction, but it
cannot adapt to the ever-changing properties of noise. To preempt the network's
ability to predict the signal and reduce its opportunity to learn the noise
properties, we propose an initial, supervised training of the network on a
frugally-generated synthetic dataset prior to fine-tuning in a self-supervised
manner on the field dataset of interest. Considering the change in peak
signal-to-noise ratio, as well as the volume of noise reduced and signal
leakage observed, we illustrate the clear benefit in initialising the
self-supervised network with the weights from a supervised base-training. This
is further supported by a test on a field dataset where the fine-tuned network
strikes the best balance between signal preservation and noise reduction.
Finally, the use of the unrealistic, frugally-generated synthetic dataset for
the supervised base-training includes a number of benefits: minimal prior
geological knowledge is required, substantially reduced computational cost for
the dataset generation, and a reduced requirement of re-training the network
should recording conditions change, to name a few.

by modeling longer user behavior sequences. Among others, the two-stage methods
stand out as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solution for industrial applications.
The two-stage methods first train a retrieval model to truncate the long
behavior sequence beforehand and then use the truncated sequences to train a
CTR model. However, the retrieval model and the CTR model are trained
separately. So the retrieved subsequences in the CTR model is inaccurate, which
degrades the final performance. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end
paradigm to model long behavior sequences, which is able to achieve superior
performance along with remarkable cost-efficiency compared to existing models.
Our contribution is three-fold: First, we propose a hashing-based efficient
target attention (TA) network named ETA-Net to enable end-to-end user behavior
retrieval based on low-cost bit-wise operations. The proposed ETA-Net can
reduce the complexity of standard TA by orders of magnitude for sequential data
modeling. Second, we propose a general system architecture as one viable
solution to deploy ETA-Net on industrial systems. Particularly, ETA-Net has
been deployed on the recommender system of Taobao, and brought 1.8% lift on CTR
and 3.1% lift on Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) compared to the SOTA two-stage
methods. Third, we conduct extensive experiments on both offline datasets and
online A/B test. The results verify that the proposed model outperforms
existing CTR models considerably, in terms of both CTR prediction performance
and online cost-efficiency. ETA-Net now serves the main traffic of Taobao,
delivering services to hundreds of millions of users towards billions of items

all the correspondences are predicted within a single feed-forward pass. We
further propose an adaptive query-clustering strategy and an uncertainty-based

make these solutions not applicable in real-worlds recommender systems where
the experience of existing users/items must be guaranteed. Meanwhile, graph

challenging but rewarding task since cold-start users/items do not have links.
Besides, it is nontrivial to design an appropriate GNN to conduct cold-start

bridge the gap, we propose a tailored GNN-based framework (GPatch) that

two-step optimization process. We tested the method with the popular soft Dice
loss for the fetal body segmentation task in two MRI sequences, TRUFI and
FIESTA, and compared full annotation regime to partial annotations with a
similar annotation effort. For TRUFI data, the use of partial annotations
yielded slightly better performance on average compared to full annotations
with an increase in Dice score from 0.936 to 0.942, and a substantial decrease
in Standard Deviations (STD) of Dice score by 22% and Average Symmetric Surface

yielded a decrease in STD of the Dice score and ASSD metrics by 27.5% and 33%

average performance on out-of-distribution data, increasing Dice score from
0.84 to 0.9 and decreasing ASSD from 7.46 to 4.01 mm. The two-step optimization
process was helpful for partial annotations for both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution data. The partial annotations method with the two-step
optimizer is therefore recommended to improve segmentation performance under
low data regime.

Existing action assessment works usually make an overall quality prediction on
an entire video. However, the internal structures of hand hygiene action are

evaluate the quality of key actions in each step. In addition, there lacks a

provides an efficient and robust way to include WWR in FVA modelling. Case
studies for an interest rate swap and a representative multi-currency portfolio

mass transfer from a evolved binary companion in regions with extended

achieve the cooperative optimal output regulation of continuous-time linear
multi-agent systems based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). The proposed
method is different from those in the existing literature of ADP and
cooperative output regulation in the sense that the knowledge of the exosystem
dynamics is not required in the design of the exostate observers for those
agents with no direct access to the exosystem. Moreover, an optimal control
policy is obtained without the prior knowledge of the modeling information of
any agent while achieving the cooperative output regulation. Instead, we use
the state/input information along the trajectories of the underlying dynamical
systems and the estimated exostates to learn the optimal control policy.
Simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, where both
estimation errors of exosystem matrix and exostates, and the tracking errors
converge to zero in an optimal sense, which solves the cooperative optimal
output regulation problem.

heating/cooling. We see considerable changes of the molecular and ice
concentrations in the disc. The most abundant species (H2, CH4, CO, the neutral
atoms in higher layers, and the ices in the midplane) are transported both up

decompose, for example by photo processes, the release of reaction products has
important consequences for all other molecules. This generally creates a more
active chemistry, with a richer mixture of ionised, atomic, molecular and ice
species and new chemical pathways that are not relevant in the unmixed case. We
discuss the impact on three spectral observations caused by mixing and find
that (i) icy grains can reach the observable disc surface where they cause ice
absorption and emission features at IR to far-IR wavelengths, (ii) mixing
increases the concentrations of certain neutral molecules observable by mid-IR
spectroscopy, in particular OH, HCN and C2H2, and (iii) mixing can change the

for facial Action Unit (AU) detection. However, due to the heterogeneity of
multi-modal data, multi-modal representation learning becomes one of the main
challenges. On one hand, it is difficult to extract the relevant features from
multi-modalities by only one feature extractor, on the other hand, previous
studies have not fully explored the potential of multi-modal fusion strategies.
For example, early fusion usually required all modalities to be present during
inference, while late fusion and middle fusion increased the network size for
feature learning. In contrast to a large amount of work on late fusion, there
are few works on early fusion to explore the channel information. This paper
presents a novel multi-modal network called Multi-modal Channel-Mixing (MCM),
as a pre-trained model to learn a robust representation in order to facilitate
the multi-modal fusion. We evaluate the learned representation on a downstream
task of automatic facial action units detection. Specifically, it is a single
stream encoder network that uses a channel-mixing module in early fusion,
requiring only one modality in the downstream detection task. We also utilize
the masked ViT encoder to learn features from the fusion image and reconstruct
back two modalities with two ViT decoders. We have conducted extensive
experiments on two public datasets, known as BP4D and DISFA, to evaluate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed multimodal framework. The results

probability distributions, with various approaches stemming from different
principles. Yet, when expressing multi-target tracking algorithms within the
framework of possibility theory, one specific fusion rule appears to be
particularly natural and useful. In this article, this fusion rule is applied
to both centralised and decentralised fusion, based on the possibilistic
analogue of the probability hypothesis density filter. We then show that the
proposed approach outperforms its probabilistic counterpart on simulated data.

  Tracking in Sports Videos",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tracking multiple athletes in sports videos is a very challenging
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) task, since athletes often have the same appearance
and are intimately covered with each other, making a common occlusion problem
becomes an abhorrent duplicate detection. In this paper, the duplicate
detection is newly and precisely defined as occlusion misreporting on the same
athlete by multiple detection boxes in one frame. To address this problem, we
meticulously design a novel transformer-based Duplicate Detection
Decontaminator (D$^3$) for training, and a specific algorithm Rally-Hungarian
(RH) for matching. Once duplicate detection occurs, D$^3$ immediately modifies
the procedure by generating enhanced boxes losses. RH, triggered by the team
sports substitution rules, is exceedingly suitable for sports videos. Moreover,
to complement the tracking dataset that without shot changes, we release a new
dataset based on sports video named RallyTrack. Extensive experiments on
RallyTrack show that combining D$^3$ and RH can dramatically improve the
tracking performance with 9.2 in MOTA and 4.5 in HOTA. Meanwhile, experiments
on MOT-series and DanceTrack discover that D$^3$ can accelerate convergence
during training, especially save up to 80 percent of the original training time
on MOT17. Finally, our model, which is trained only with volleyball videos, can
be applied directly to basketball and soccer videos for MAT, which shows
priority of our method. Our dataset is available at
https://github.com/heruihr/rallytrack.

the flares emission from soft-X to Gamma ray energy range and to monitor the
solar activity in the Fraunhofer Mg II doublet at 280 nm, taking advantage of a
full disk imager payload. The Gamma and X-ray fluxes will be studied with
unprecedented temporal resolution and with a multi-wavelength approach thanks
to the combined use of silicon photodiode and silicon photomultiplier (SiPM)
-based detectors. The flare spectrum will be explored from the keV to the MeV
range of energies by the same payload, and with a cadence up to 10 kHz and with
single-photon detection capabilities to unveil the sources of the solar flares.
The energy range covers the same bands used by GOES satellites, which are the
standard bands for flare magnitude definition. At the same time SiPM detectors
combined with scintillators allow to cover the non-thermal bremsstrahlung
emission in the gamma energy range. Given its UV imaging capabilities, SEE will
be a key space asset to support detailed studies on solar activity, especially
in relation to ultraviolet radiation which strongly interacts with the upper
layers of the Earth's atmosphere, and in relation to space safety, included in
the field of human space exploration. The main goal for the UV payload is to
study the evolution of the solar UV emission in the Mg II band at two different
time scales: yearly variations along the solar cycle and transient variations
during flare events.

the methods of Bayesian rationality are incompatible with jurisprudential
principles such as the Presumption of Innocence. To this end, I prove a
representation theorem that shows that so long as a juror would not convict the
defendant having heard no testimony (the Presumption of Innocence) but would
convict upon hearing some collection of testimony (Willingness to Convict),
then this juror's disposition to convict the defendant is representable as the
disposition of a Bayesian threshold juror in Posner's sense. This result
indicates that relevant notion of a Bayesian threshold juror is insufficiently
specified to render this debate a substantive one.

  Networks",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Localizing anatomical landmarks are important tasks in medical image
analysis. However, the landmarks to be localized often lack prominent visual
features. Their locations are elusive and easily confused with the background,
and thus precise localization highly depends on the context formed by their
surrounding areas. In addition, the required precision is usually higher than
segmentation and object detection tasks. Therefore, localization has its unique
challenges different from segmentation or detection. In this paper, we propose
a zoom-in attentive network (ZIAN) for anatomical landmark localization in
ocular images. First, a coarse-to-fine, or ""zoom-in"" strategy is utilized to
learn the contextualized features in different scales. Then, an attentive
fusion module is adopted to aggregate multi-scale features, which consists of
1) a co-attention network with a multiple regions-of-interest (ROIs) scheme
that learns complementary features from the multiple ROIs, 2) an
attention-based fusion module which integrates the multi-ROIs features and
non-ROI features. We evaluated ZIAN on two open challenge tasks, i.e., the
fovea localization in fundus images and scleral spur localization in AS-OCT
images. Experiments show that ZIAN achieves promising performances and
outperforms state-of-the-art localization methods. The source code and trained
models of ZIAN are available at

significant performances on various recommendation tasks. However, many
existing GCN models tend to perform recursive aggregations among all related
nodes, which can arise severe computational burden to hinder their application
to large-scale recommendation tasks. To this end, this paper proposes the
flattened GCN~(FlatGCN) model, which is able to achieve superior performance
with remarkably less complexity compared with existing models. Our main
contribution is three-fold. First, we propose a simplified but powerful GCN
architecture which aggregates the neighborhood information using one flattened
GCN layer, instead of recursively. The aggregation step in FlatGCN is
parameter-free such that it can be pre-computed with parallel computation to
save memory and computational cost. Second, we propose an informative
neighbor-infomax sampling method to select the most valuable neighbors by
measuring the correlation among neighboring nodes based on a principled metric.
Third, we propose a layer ensemble technique which improves the expressiveness
of the learned representations by assembling the layer-wise neighborhood
representations at the final layer. Extensive experiments on three datasets
verify that our proposed model outperforms existing GCN models considerably and
yields up to a few orders of magnitude speedup in training efficiency.
