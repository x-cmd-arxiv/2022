correlation throughout the entire quantum many-body system. This concept has
become a central topic in different contexts. In this work, we restate the
connection between anyon condensation and topological quantum information
scrambling in quantum Hall interfaces. We consider the interface between the
Abelian Halperin-330 state and the non-Abelian Read-Rezayi state. We verify
explicitly that the interface can be fully gapped. This allows the
transmutation of local pseudospin information carried by an Abelian anyon into
topological information stored entirely by the anyons in the non-Abelian
quantum Hall liquid, with no scrambled information stored at the interface. In
combination with our previous work [K. K. W. Ma and K. Yang, Phys. Rev. B 105,

mechanism on the gapfulness of the interface. Possible Andreev-like reflection
of non-Abelian anyons in the fully gapped interface is also discussed.

that maximises the expected profit. Some recent works have proposed an
alternative approach, in which the goal is to minimise the conditional
value-at-risk (CVaR), a very popular risk measure in financial risk management.
Unfortunately, CVaR estimation involves considering observations with extreme
values, which poses problems for both parametric and non-parametric methods.
Indeed, parametric methods often underestimate the downside risk, which leads
to significant losses in extreme cases. The existing non-parametric methods, on
the other hand, are extremely computationally expensive for large instances. In
this paper, we propose an alternative non-parametric approach to CVaR
minimisation that uses only a small proportion of the data. Using both
simulation and real-life case studies, we show that the proposed method can be
very useful in practice, allowing the decision makers to suffer less downside
loss in extreme cases while requiring reasonable computing effort.

robust characterization protocols are needed to first certify topological

this grand challenge by providing a series of experimentally accessible near-
and medium-term protocols assessing the fidelity of logical processes. To do so
we examine logical operators and anyonic quasiparticle excitations in twisted
$\mathbb{Z}_{N=2,4}$ gauge theories. Extending the finite twist, a promising
route to Ising computing in its own right, to a non-contractible twist fuses
prior logical operators together and results in a twisted qubit code. The code
is notable for a doubled and tripled code distance for logical $Y$ and $X$
errors respectively. Next, we review the deconfinement properties of a
$\mathbb{Z}_4$ double semion condensation and provide an error correction
algorithm. Based on this understanding we then present a $\mathbb{Z}_4$
topological quasiparticle reflectometry and scattering protocol. The protocol
infers the topological properties of the system and serves as a high-level
metric for the performance and lifetime of the interfaced topological codes.
Our logical and scattering protocols are suitable for near-term devices where
many physical qubits encode few logical qubits. The topological lifetime of a
particle within a condensate conjugacy class, previously considered in
fabricated and hetero-structured condensed-matter experiments, serves as a
unifying performance metric across synthetic, qubit-based, and naturally
occurring topological order.

consists of a digital inline holography module for imaging falling snow
particles in a sample volume of 88 cm3 and a high-precision scale to measure
the weight of the same particles in a synchronized fashion. The holographic
images are processed in real-time using a machine learning model and
post-processing to determine snow particle concentration, size, shape, and
type. Such information is used to obtain the estimated volume, which is
subsequently correlated with the weight of snow particles to estimate their
density. The performance of the analyzer is assessed using monodispersed
spherical glass beads and irregular salt crystals with known density, which
shows <5% density measurement errors. In addition, the analyzer was tested in a
number of field deployments under different snow and wind conditions. The
system is able to achieve measurements of various snow properties at single
particle resolution and statistical robustness. The analyzer was also deployed
for four hours of operation during a snow event with changing snow and wind
conditions, demonstrating its ability for long-term and real-time monitoring of

Small-scale current gradients can be imprinted into a strongly magnetized
outflow by the same processes that source fireball radiation in the closed
magnetosphere. This structure arises from a combination of crustal yielding,
internal tearing, and turbulent cascade. We consider the quasi-linear
development of weak, small-scale currents as (i) they are stretched out and
frozen by relativistic expansion and then (ii) pass through a shock. In
particular, we derive the amplitudes of the ordinary and fast waves that emerge
downstream of a relativistically magnetized shock in response to a mode that is
frozen into the upstream flow (a frozen Alfv\'en wave or entropy wave). An
upstream mode with comoving wavelength exceeding the skin depth can linearly
convert to a secondary mode propagating above the plasma frequency. A simple
and accurate treatment of shocks with extreme magnetization is developed, and
the formation of internal shocks in the outflow from a bursting, rotating
magnetar is outlined. The emission process described here does not require a
strong shock or cool $e^\pm$ pairs (in contrast with the electromagnetic maser
shock instability). In some cases, a high-frequency wave is reflected back to
the observer, but with a minuscule amplitude that makes it subdominant to other
emission channels. The dominant secondary electromagnetic mode is superluminal
at emission, is subject to weak induced scattering within the outflow, and can
reach the observer in the radio band.

e.g., they do not allow dynamic memory allocation and variable-length arrays,
limit the way in which loops are used, forbid recursion, and bound the
complexity of control conditions. As a matter of facts, these linguistic
features are also the main efficiency-blockers for the test generation
approaches based on symbolic execution at the state of the art. This paper
contributes new evidence of the effectiveness of generating test cases with
symbolic execution for a significant class of industrial safety
critical-systems. We specifically focus on Scade, a largely adopted model-based
development language for safety-critical embedded software, and we report on a
case study in which we exploited symbolic execution to automatically generate
test cases for a set of safety-critical programs developed in Scade. To this
end, we introduce a novel test generator that we developed in a recent
industrial project on testing safety-critical railway software written in
Scade, and we report on our experience of using this test generator for testing
a set of Scade programs that belong to the development of an on-board signaling
unit for high-speed rail. The results provide empirically evidence that
symbolic execution is indeed a viable approach for generating high-quality test
suites for the safety-critical programs considered in our case study.

their angles (which depend on the data points), and the qubits on which the
various gates act. Since combinatorial optimization is computationally
expensive, we have introduced a criterion based on the exponential
concentration of kernel matrix coefficients around the mean to immediately
discard an arbitrarily large portion of solutions that are believed to perform
poorly. Contrary to the gradient-based optimization (e.g. trainable quantum
kernels), our approach is not affected by the barren plateau by construction.

constrained environments with obstacles is a meaningful but challenging task.
Global planning is necessary for such a highly-constrained task; however,
accurate models of DLOs required by planners are difficult to obtain owing to
their deformable nature, and the inevitable modeling errors significantly
affect the planning results, probably resulting in task failure if the robot
simply executes the planned path in an open-loop manner. In this paper, we
propose a coarse-to-fine framework to combine global planning and local control
for dual-arm manipulation of DLOs, capable of precisely achieving desired
configurations and avoiding potential collisions between the DLO, robot, and
obstacles. Specifically, the global planner refers to a simple yet effective
DLO energy model and computes a coarse path to find a feasible solution
efficiently; then the local controller follows that path as guidance and
further shapes it with closed-loop feedback to compensate for the planning
errors and improve the task accuracy. Both simulations and real-world
experiments demonstrate that our framework can robustly achieve desired DLO
configurations in constrained environments with imprecise DLO models, which may
not be reliably achieved by only planning or control.

are able to achieve up to 95% of the sensitive distance of matched-filtering
based production analyses for simulated Gaussian noise at a false-alarm rate

learning search achieved 70%. For higher FARs the differences in sensitive
distance shrink to the point where select machine learning submissions
outperform traditional search algorithms at FARs $\geq 200$ per month on some
datasets. Our results show that current machine learning search algorithms may
already be sensitive enough in limited parameter regions to be useful for some
production settings. To improve the state-of-the-art, machine learning
algorithms need to reduce the false-alarm rates at which they are capable of
detecting signals and extend their validity to regions of parameter space where
modeled searches are computationally expensive to run. Based on our findings we
compile a list of research areas that we believe are the most important to
elevate machine learning searches to an invaluable tool in gravitational-wave

horizon in a flowing Bose-Einstein condensate where the elementary excitations
obey the Bogoliubov dispersion relation. In the hamiltonian ray theory the
solutions undergo a broken pitchfork bifurcation near the horizon and one might
therefore expect the associated wave structure to be given by a Pearcey
function, this being the universal wave function that dresses catastrophes with
two control parameters. However, the wave function is in fact an Airy-type
function supplemented by a logarithmic phase term, a novel type of wave
catastrophe. Similar wave functions arise in aeroacoustic flows from jet
engines and also gravitational horizons if dispersion which violates Lorentz
symmetry in the UV is included. The approach we take differs from previous
authors in that we analyze the behaviour of the integral representation of the
wave function using exponential coordinates. This allows for a different
treatment of the branches that gives rise to an analysis based purely on
saddlepoint expansions, which resolve the multiple real and complex waves that
interact at the horizon and its companion caustic. We find that the horizon is
a physical manifestation of a Stokes surface, marking the place where a wave is
born, and that the horizon and the caustic do not in general coincide: the
finite spatial region between them delineates a broadened horizon.

(R\'enyi, 1959). Their idea was later developed in Deb et al. (2020) and the

statistic's limiting variance under independence and showing that it only
depends on the manifold dimension.

cloud applications and systems, data center architectures evolved to integrate
heterogeneous computing fabrics that leverage CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. FPGAs
differ from traditional processing platforms such as CPUs and GPUs in that they
are reconfigurable at run-time, providing increased and customized performance,
flexibility, and acceleration. FPGAs can perform large-scale search
optimization, acceleration, and signal processing tasks compared with power,
latency, and processing speed. Many public cloud provider giants, including
Amazon, Huawei, Microsoft, Alibaba, etc., have already started integrating
FPGA-based cloud acceleration services. While FPGAs in cloud applications
enable customized acceleration with low power consumption, it also incurs new
security challenges that still need to be reviewed. Allowing cloud users to
reconfigure the hardware design after deployment could open the backdoors for
malicious attackers, potentially putting the cloud platform at risk.
Considering security risks, public cloud providers still don't offer
multi-tenant FPGA services. This paper analyzes the security concerns of
multi-tenant cloud FPGAs, gives a thorough description of the security problems
associated with them, and discusses upcoming future challenges in this field of
study.

costly, particularly in application domains where labels have to be provided by
specialized expert annotators, such as civil engineering. In this paper, we
propose to use attribution methods to harness the valuable interactions between
expert annotators and the data to be annotated in the case of defect
segmentation for visual inspection of civil infrastructures. Concretely, a
classifier is trained to detect defects and coupled with an attribution-based
method and adversarial climbing to generate and refine segmentation masks
corresponding to the classification outputs. These are used within an assisted
labeling framework where the annotators can interact with them as proposal
segmentation masks by deciding to accept, reject or modify them, and
interactions are logged as weak labels to further refine the classifier.
Applied on a real-world dataset resulting from the automated visual inspection
of bridges, our proposed method is able to save more than 50\% of annotators'
time when compared to manual annotation of defects.

solar metallicity M4V star, which was discovered using Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite photometry and then confirmed using a combination of precise
radial velocities, ground-based photometry, spectra, and speckle imaging.
TOI-5205~b has one of the highest mass ratios for M dwarf planets with a mass
ratio of almost 0.3$\%$, as it orbits a host star that is just $0.392 \pm
0.015$ \solmass{}. Its planetary radius is $1.03 \pm 0.03~R_J$, while the mass
is $1.08 \pm 0.06~M_J$. Additionally, the large size of the planet orbiting a
small star results in a transit depth of $\sim 7\%$, making it one of the
deepest transits of a confirmed exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star. The
large transit depth makes TOI-5205~b a compelling target to probe its
atmospheric properties, as a means of tracing the potential formation pathways.
While there have been radial-velocity-only discoveries of giant planets around
mid-M dwarfs, this is the first transiting Jupiter with a mass measurement
discovered around such a low-mass host star. The high mass of TOI-5205~b
stretches conventional theories of planet formation and disk scaling relations
that cannot easily recreate the conditions required to form such planets.

to train performant 3D generative models that synthesize textured meshes which
can be directly consumed by 3D rendering engines, thus immediately usable in
downstream applications. Prior works on 3D generative modeling either lack
geometric details, are limited in the mesh topology they can produce, typically
do not support textures, or utilize neural renderers in the synthesis process,
which makes their use in common 3D software non-trivial. In this work, we
introduce GET3D, a Generative model that directly generates Explicit Textured
3D meshes with complex topology, rich geometric details, and high-fidelity
textures. We bridge recent success in the differentiable surface modeling,
differentiable rendering as well as 2D Generative Adversarial Networks to train
our model from 2D image collections. GET3D is able to generate high-quality 3D
textured meshes, ranging from cars, chairs, animals, motorbikes and human
characters to buildings, achieving significant improvements over previous

that leave the action invariant give rise to (invertible) topological defects,
which obey group-like fusion rules. One can construct more general
(codimension-one) topological defects by specifying a map between
gauge-invariant operators from one side of the defect and such operators on the
other side. In this work, we apply such construction to Maxwell theory in four
dimensions and to the free compact scalar theory in two dimensions. In the case
of Maxwell theory, we show that a topological defect that mixes the field
strength $F$ and its Hodge dual $\star F$ can be at most an $SO(2)$ rotation.
For rational values of the bulk coupling and the $\theta$-angle we find an
explicit defect Lagrangian that realizes values of the $SO(2)$ angle $\varphi$
such that $\cos \varphi$ is also rational. We further determine the action of
such defects on Wilson and 't Hooft lines and show that they are in general
non-invertible. We repeat the analysis for the free compact scalar $\phi$ in
two dimensions. In this case we find only four discrete maps: the trivial one,
a $Z_2$ map $d\phi \rightarrow -d\phi$, a $\mathcal{T}$-duality-like map $d\phi
\rightarrow i \star d\phi$, and the product of the last two.

  Miller","Controlling the direction of steady electric fields in liquid using
  non-antiperiodic potentials",,,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When applying an oscillatory electric potential to an electrolyte solution,
it is commonly assumed that the choice of which electrode is grounded or
powered does not matter because the time-average of the electric potential is
zero. Recent theoretical, numerical, and experimental work, however, has
established that certain types of multimodal oscillatory potentials that are
""non-antiperodic"" can induce a net steady field toward either the grounded or
powered electrode [Hashemi et al., Phys. Rev. E 105, 065001 (2022)]. Here, we
elaborate on the nature of these steady fields through numerical and
theoretical analyses of the asymmetric rectified electric field (AREF) that
occurs in electrolytes where the cations and anions have different mobilities.
We demonstrate that AREFs induced by a non-antiperiodic electric potential,
e.g., by a two-mode waveform with modes at 2 and 3 Hz, invariably yields a
steady field that is spatially dissymmetric between two parallel electrodes,
such that swapping which electrode is powered changes the direction of the
field. Additionally, using a perturbation expansion, we demonstrate that the
dissymmetric AREF occurs due to odd nonlinear orders of the applied potential.
We further generalize the theory by demonstrating that the dissymmetric field
occurs for all classes of zero-time-average (no dc bias) periodic potentials,
including triangular and rectangular pulses, and we discuss how these steady
fields can tremendously change the interpretation, design, and applications of
electrochemical and electrokinetic systems.

Boolean query Q, given an instance I, how many subinstances of I satisfy Q.
Equivalently, this is a restricted case of Boolean query evaluation on
tuple-independent probabilistic databases where all facts must have probability
1/2. We focus on graph signatures, and on queries closed under homomorphisms.
We show that for any such query that is unbounded, i.e., not equivalent to a
union of conjunctive queries, the uniform reliability problem is #P-hard. This
recaptures the hardness, e.g., of s-t connectedness, which counts how many
subgraphs of an input graph have a path between a source and a sink.
  This new hardness result on uniform reliability strengthens our earlier
hardness result on probabilistic query evaluation for unbounded
homomorphism-closed queries (ICDT'20). Indeed, our earlier proof crucially used
facts with probability 1, so it did not apply to the unweighted case. The new
proof presented in this paper avoids this; it uses our recent hardness result
on uniform reliability for non-hierarchical conjunctive queries without
self-joins (ICDT'21), along with new techniques.

that if these charges flow upward along electric field lines, their initial

hemisphere of radius $r$ that becomes uniform in the $r \to\infty$ limit. To
learn the bijective transformation, we estimate the normalized field in the
augmented space. For sampling, we devise a backward ODE that is anchored by the
physically meaningful additional dimension: the samples hit the unaugmented
data manifold when the $z$ reaches zero. Experimentally, PFGM achieves current
state-of-the-art performance among the normalizing flow models on CIFAR-10,
with an Inception score of $9.68$ and a FID score of $2.35$. It also performs
on par with the state-of-the-art SDE approaches while offering $10\times $ to
$20 \times$ acceleration on image generation tasks. Additionally, PFGM appears
more tolerant of estimation errors on a weaker network architecture and robust

for the weakly bound states were obtained by solving a rate equation model and

hitherto been a prohibitively complex problem. In fact, past works have
highlighted challenges in achieving computational convergence with respect to
length and/or time scales using either the established Allen-Feldman or
Green-Kubo formulations, endorsing the concept that atomistic models containing
thousands of atoms -- thus beyond the capabilities of first-principles
calculations -- are needed to describe the thermal conductivity of glasses. In
addition, these established formulations either neglect anharmonicity
(Allen-Feldman) or miss the Bose-Einstein statistics of atomic vibrations
(Green Kubo), thus leaving open the question on the relevance of these effects.
Here, we present a first-principles formulation to address the thermal
conductivity of glasses above the plateau, which can account comprehensively
for the effects of structural disorder, anharmonicity, and quantum
Bose-Einstein statistics. The protocol combines the Wigner formulation of
thermal transport with convergence-acceleration techniques, and is validated in
vitreous silica using both first-principles calculations and a quantum-accurate
machine-learned interatomic potential. We show that models of vitreous silica
containing less than 200 atoms can already reproduce the thermal conductivity
in the macroscopic limit and that anharmonicity negligibly affects heat
transport in vitreous silica. We discuss the microscopic quantities that
determine the trend of the conductivity at high temperature, highlighting the
agreement of the calculations with experiments in the temperature range above
the plateau where radiative effects remain negligible (50<T <450 K).

deep learning on edge devices. The current research mainly devotes efforts to
reducing training costs by further increasing model sparsity. However,
increasing sparsity is not always ideal since it will inevitably introduce
severe accuracy degradation at an extremely high sparsity level. This paper
intends to explore other possible directions to effectively and efficiently
reduce sparse training costs while preserving accuracy. To this end, we
investigate two techniques, namely, layer freezing and data sieving. First, the
layer freezing approach has shown its success in dense model training and
fine-tuning, yet it has never been adopted in the sparse training domain.
Nevertheless, the unique characteristics of sparse training may hinder the
incorporation of layer freezing techniques. Therefore, we analyze the
feasibility and potentiality of using the layer freezing technique in sparse
training and find it has the potential to save considerable training costs.
Second, we propose a data sieving method for dataset-efficient training, which
further reduces training costs by ensuring only a partial dataset is used
throughout the entire training process. We show that both techniques can be
well incorporated into the sparse training algorithm to form a generic
framework, which we dub SpFDE. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SpFDE
can significantly reduce training costs while preserving accuracy from three
dimensions: weight sparsity, layer freezing, and dataset sieving.

where $H$ is the pressure scale height, are performed using PENCIL for two
Stokes numbers, \St$=0.04$ and $0.2$, at 1\% disk metallicity. We find a
complex of Ekman-layer jet-flows emerge subject to three co-acting linearly
growing processes: (1) the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), (2) the
planet-forming disk analog of the baroclinic Symmetric Instability (SymI), and
(3) a later-time weakly acting secondary transition process, possibly a
manifestation of the SI, producing a radially propagating pattern state. For
\St$=0.2$, KHI is dominant and manifests as off-midplane axisymmetric rolls,
while for \St$=0.04$ the axisymmetric SymI mainly drives turbulence. SymI is
analytically developed in a model disk flow, predicting that it becomes
strongly active when the Richardson number (Ri) of the particle-gas midplane
layer transitions below 1, exhibiting growth rates $\le\sqrt{2/\Ri -
2}\cdot\Omega$, where $\Omega$ is local disk rotation rate. For fairly general
situations absent external sources of turbulence it is conjectured that the SI,
when and if initiated, emerges out of a turbulent state primarily driven and
shaped by at least SymI and/or KHI. We also find that turbulence produced in
$256^3$ resolution simulations are not statistically converged and that
corresponding $512^3$ simulations may be converged for \St$=0.2$. Furthermore,
we report that our numerical simulations significantly dissipate turbulent

quantum metrology. Our algorithm separates the gate parameter
$\varphi$~(single-qubit Z phase) that is susceptible to time-dependent error
from the target gate parameter $\theta$~(swap-angle between |10> and |01>
states) that is largely free of time-dependent error. Our method achieves an
accuracy of $10^{-4}$ radians in standard deviation for learning $\theta$ in
superconducting-qubit experiments, outperforming existing alternative schemes
by two orders of magnitude. We also demonstrate the increased robustness in
learning time-dependent gate parameters through fast Fourier transformation and
sequential phase difference. We show both theoretically and numerically that
there is an interesting transition of the optimal metrology variance scaling as
a function of circuit depth $d$ from the pre-asymptotic regime $d \ll 1/\theta$
to Heisenberg limit $d \to \infty$. Remarkably, in the pre-asymptotic regime
our method's estimation variance on time-sensitive parameter $\varphi$ scales
faster than the asymptotic Heisenberg limit as a function of depth,
$\text{Var}(\hat{\varphi})\approx 1/d^4$. Our work is the first
quantum-signal-processing algorithm that demonstrates practical application in

probability that $(X,Y)\in A\times A$, where $X,Y$ are standard Gaussian random
vectors with correlation $\rho\in(0,1)$. It is well-known that a Euclidean set
of fixed Gaussian volume that maximizes noise stability must be a half space.
  For a partition of Euclidean space into $m>2$ parts each of Gaussian measure
$1/m$, it is still unknown what sets maximize the sum of their noise
stabilities. In this work, we classify partitions maximizing noise stability
that are also critical points for the derivative of noise stability with
respect to $\rho$. We call a partition satisfying these conditions hyperstable.
Uner the assumption that a maximizing partition is hyperstable, we prove:
  * a (conditional) version of the Plurality is Stablest Conjecture for $3$ or
$4$ candidates.
  * a (conditional) sharp Unique Games Hardness result for MAX-m-CUT for $m=3$
or $4$
  * a (conditional) version of the Propeller Conjecture of Khot and Naor for
$4$ sets.
  We also show that a symmetric set that is hyperstable must be star-shaped.
  For partitions of Euclidean space into $m>2$ parts of fixed (but perhaps
unequal) Gaussian measure, the hyperstable property can only be satisfied when
all of the parts have Gaussian measure $1/m$. So, as our main contribution, we
have identified a possible strategy for proving the full Plurality is Stablest
Conjecture and the full sharp hardness for MAX-m-CUT: to prove both statements,
it suffices to show that sets maximizing noise stability are hyperstable. This
last point is crucial since any proof of the Plurality is Stablest Conjecture
must use a property that is special to partitions of sets into equal measures,
since the conjecture is false in the unequal measure case.

stars, but its nature is a mystery. These excesses are interpreted as thermal
emission from populations of small, hot dust very close to their stars (`hot
exozodis'), but such grains should rapidly sublimate or be blown out of the
system. To date, no model has fully explained this phenomenon. One mechanism
commonly suggested in the literature is cometary supply, where star-grazing
comets deposit dust close to the star, replenishing losses from grain
sublimation and blowout. However, we show that this mechanism alone is very
unlikely to be responsible for hot exozodis. We model the trajectory and size
evolution of dust grains released by star-grazing comets, to establish the dust
and comet properties required to reproduce hot-exozodi observations. We find
that cometary supply alone can only reproduce observations if dust ejecta has
an extremely steep size distribution upon release, and the dust-deposition rate
is extraordinarily high. These requirements strongly contradict our current
understanding of cometary dust and planetary systems. Cometary supply is
therefore unlikely to be solely responsible for hot exozodis, so may need to be
combined with some dust-trapping mechanism (such as gas or magnetic trapping)
if it is to reproduce observations.

This simple primitive is enough to induce efficient exploration strategies for

this work, we propose to relax this assumption by allowing concept examples to
be scattered across different clusters in the DNN's latent space. Each concept
is then represented by a region of the DNN's latent space that includes these
clusters and that we call concept activation region (CAR). To formalize this
idea, we introduce an extension of the CAV formalism that is based on the
kernel trick and support vector classifiers. This CAR formalism yields global
concept-based explanations and local concept-based feature importance. We prove
that CAR explanations built with radial kernels are invariant under latent
space isometries. In this way, CAR assigns the same explanations to latent
spaces that have the same geometry. We further demonstrate empirically that
CARs offer (1) more accurate descriptions of how concepts are scattered in the
DNN's latent space; (2) global explanations that are closer to human concept

The first, CLIP (Radford et al. 2021), exhibits the ability to assign names to
image content but lacks an accessible representation of object structure. The
second, DINO (Caron et al. 2021), captures the spatial extent of objects but
has no knowledge of object names. Our method, termed NamedMask, begins by using
CLIP to construct category-specific archives of images. These images are
pseudo-labelled with a category-agnostic salient object detector bootstrapped
from DINO, then refined by category-specific segmenters using the CLIP archive
labels. Thanks to the high quality of the refined masks, we show that a
standard segmentation architecture trained on these archives with appropriate
data augmentation achieves impressive semantic segmentation abilities for both
single-object and multi-object images. As a result, our proposed NamedMask
performs favourably against a range of prior work on five benchmarks including
the VOC2012, COCO and large-scale ImageNet-S datasets.

Such prompt cusps have a density profile $\rho\propto r^{-1.5}$ extending up to
a limiting density dependent on the nature of the dark matter. Numerical
simulations and theoretical arguments suggest that the bulk of these cusps
survive until the present day. Here we show that if dark matter is a thermally
produced weakly interacting massive particle, many thousands of prompt cusps
with individual masses similar to that of the earth should be present in every
solar mass of dark matter. This radically alters predictions for the amount and
spatial distribution of dark matter annihilation radiation, substantially
tightening observational constraints on the relevant cross sections. In
particular, the cross section required to explain the observed $\gamma$-ray

We have identified a new yellow supergiant and spectroscopically confirmed
eight new RSGs and one bright giant in the Magellanic Clouds. Additionally, we
observed a supergiant B[e] star and found that the spectral type has changed

a trivial state to the desired solution. On an ideal quantum computer, the
solution quality improves monotonically with increasing circuit depth. By
contrast, increasing the depth in current noisy computers introduces more noise
and eventually deteriorates any computational advantage. What is the optimal
circuit depth that provides the best solution? Here, we address this question
by investigating an adiabatic circuit that interpolates between the
paramagnetic and ferromagnetic ground states of the one-dimensional quantum
Ising model. We characterize the quality of the final output by the density of
defects $d$, as a function of the circuit depth $N$ and noise strength
$\sigma$. We find that $d$ is well-described by the simple form
$d_\mathrm{ideal}+d_\mathrm{noise}$, where the ideal case $d_\mathrm{ideal}\sim
N^{-1/2}$ is controlled by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and the noise
contribution scales as $d_\mathrm{noise}\sim N\sigma^2$. It follows that the
optimal number of steps minimizing the number of defects goes as
$\sim\sigma^{-4/3}$. We implement this algorithm on a noisy superconducting
quantum processor and find that the dependence of the density of defects on the

technically compatible with those constraints. Furthermore, a ''golden ALP
mass'' is identified at the frontier between the two energy bin windows of
$R_{K^\ast}$, which could simultaneously explain these two $R_{K^\ast}$
anomalies together with $R_K$; this calls for the convenience of different
energy binning which would easily clear up this (unlikely) possibility. The
impact of smearing on data analysis is also discussed. When loop effects are
taken into account, the solutions found can be in addition compatible with the
data on the $g-2$ of the electron but not simultaneously with those on the
$g-2$ of the muon. Furthermore, loop effects may require fine-tunings of some
coupling values.

clustering algorithms which assign the observational and simulated data to
clusters in high dimensionality. From the clustering result, a goodness of fit
(the p-value) is determined with the Fisher-Freeman-Halton test. We first show
that this approach is robust for 2D Gaussian distributions. We then apply the
method to the observed MW satellites and simulated satellites from the fiducial
model of our semi-analytic code A-SLOTH. We use the following 5 observables of
the galaxies in the analysis: stellar mass, virial mass, heliocentric distance,
mean stellar metallicity [Fe/H], and stellar metallicity dispersion
{\sigma}[Fe/H]. A low p-value returned from the analysis tells us that our
A-SLOTH fiducial model does not reproduce the mean stellar metallicity of the
observed MW satellites well. We implement an ad-hoc improvement to the physical
model and show that the number of dark matter merger trees which have p-values
> 0.01 increases from 3 to 6. This method can be extended to data with higher

responsible for the formation of passive galaxies through cosmic time remain
unclear. The shape and evolution of the Stellar Mass Function (SMF) give an
insight into these mechanisms. Taking advantage from the CANDELS and the deep
Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) programs, we estimated the SMF of total,
star-forming and passive galaxies from z=0.25 to z=2.75 to unprecedented depth,
and focus on the latter population. The density of passive galaxies underwent a
significant evolution over the last 11 Gyr. They account for 60% of the total
mass in the nearby Universe against ~20% observed at z~2.5. The inclusion of
the HFF program allows us to detect, for the first time at z>1.5, the
characteristic upturn in the SMF of passive galaxies at low masses, usually
associated with environmental quenching. We observe two separate populations of
passive galaxies evolving on different timescales: roughly half of the high
mass systems were already quenched at high redshift, while low mass passive
galaxies are gradually building-up over the redshift range probed. In the
framework of environmental-quenching at low masses, we interpret this finding
as evidence of an increasing role of the environment in the build-up of passive
galaxies as a function of time. Finally, we compared our findings with a set of
theoretical predictions. Despite good agreement in some redshift and mass
intervals, none of the models are able to fully reproduce the observations.
This calls for further investigation into the involved physical mechanisms,
both theoretically and observationally, especially with the brand new JWST
data.

supervised machine learning, DRL does not rely on static neural network
training from data alone, but a learning agent autonomously develops optimal
solutions, based on reward and penalty elements, with reduced or no
supervision. In our approach, a temperature-dependent Allen-Cahn model for
phase transformation is used as the environment for the DRL agent, serving as
the model world in which it gains experience and takes autonomous decisions.
The agent of the DRL algorithm is controlling the temperature of the system, as
a model furnace for heat-treatment of alloys. Microstructure goals are defined
for the agent based on the desired microstructure of the phases. After
training, the agent can generate temperature-time profiles for a variety of
initial microstructure states to reach the final desired microstructure state.
The agent's performance and the physical meaning of the heat-treatment profiles
generated are investigated in detail. In particular, the agent is capable of
controlling the temperature to reach the desired microstructure starting from a
variety of initial conditions. This capability of the agent in handling a
variety of conditions paves the way for using such an approach also for
recycling-oriented heat treatment process design where the initial composition
can vary from batch to batch, due to impurity intrusion, and also for the
design of energy-efficient heat treatments. For testing this hypothesis, an
agent without penalty on the total consumed energy is compared with one that
considers energy costs. The energy cost penalty is imposed as an additional
criterion on the agent for finding the optimal temperature-time profile.

ratio, pressure, and flow rate on the production rates and composition of the
gas and solid products at a Titan relevant temperature (100 K) for the first

with increasing CH4 ratio. The nitrogen-containing species have much higher
yield than hydrocarbons in the gas products, and the N-to-C ratio of the solid
products appears to be the highest compared to previous plasma simulations with
the same CH4 ratio. The greater degree of nitrogen incorporation in the low
temperature simulation experiments suggests temperature may play an important
role in nitrogen incorporation in Titan's cold atmosphere. We also find that H2
is the dominant gas product and serves as an indicator of the production rate
of new organic molecules in the experiment, and that CH2NH may greatly
contribute to the incorporation of both carbon and nitrogen into the solid

predicting additional light propagating species of neutrino are naturally

the capacity to probe deviations from the standard three-neutrino scenario

present a CNN accelerator and an accompanying automated design methodology that

have been observed for several decades. Coronal rain, cascades of
catastrophically-cooled plasma, outline the loops and provide eye-catching
evidence of the recent flare. These events are acknowledged to be common, but
the scientific literature does not include any statistical overview documenting
just how common the phenomenon actually is. This study reviews Solar Dynamics
Observatory Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO AIA) observations of 241 flares
collected from the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) database between 2011
and 2018. The flares cover the entire strength range of the C, M, and X GOES
classes, and are distributed evenly across the SDO-observed majority of Solar
Cycle 24. We find that post-flare arcade rain occurs for nearly all X and most
M-class flares, but that it tapers off rapidly within C-class flares. There
appears to be a cut-off point around C5, below which the occurrence of
post-flare arcade rain drops significantly. There is also a general positive
correlation between GOES class and the average duration of post-flare rain
events. Post-flare arcade rain events in C-class flares appear to track with
the sunspot number, providing a potential new tool for estimating, if not
predicting, solar cycle strength. Furthermore, condensations appear to be
suppressed in the shortest-length arcade loops of any class observed,
suggesting that active region heating is height-constrained. These results open
up further avenues for future research, including new methods to estimate
energy deposition and to gain greater insight into steady active region

populations to financial markets, are described by stochastic processes.
Parameters characterizing such processes can often be inferred using
information integrated over stochastic paths. However, estimating
time-integrated quantities from real data with limited time resolution is
challenging. Here, we propose a framework for accurately estimating
time-integrated quantities using B\'ezier interpolation. We applied our
approach to two dynamical inference problems: determining fitness parameters
for evolving populations and inferring forces driving Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
processes. We found that B\'ezier interpolation reduces the estimation bias for
both dynamical inference problems. This improvement was especially noticeable
for data sets with limited time resolution. Our method could be broadly applied
to improve accuracy for other dynamical inference problems using finitely
sampled data.

  Calculations","To be published in 2022 29th IEEE International Conference on High
  Performance Computing, Data, and Analytics",,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Tensor cores (TCs) are a type of Application-Specific Integrated Circuit
(ASIC) and are a recent addition to Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
architectures. As such, TCs are purposefully designed to greatly improve the
performance of Matrix Multiply-Accumulate (MMA) operations. While TCs are
heavily studied for machine learning and closely related fields, where their
high efficiency is undeniable, MMA operations are not unique to these fields.
More generally, any computation that can be expressed as MMA operations can
leverage TCs, and potentially benefit from their higher computational
throughput compared to other general-purpose cores, such as CUDA cores on
Nvidia GPUs. In this paper, we propose the first double precision (FP64)
Euclidean distance calculation algorithm, which is expressed as MMA operations
to leverage TCs on Nvidia GPUs, rather than the more commonly used CUDA cores.
To show that the Euclidean distance can be accelerated in a real-world
application, we evaluate our proposed TC algorithm on the distance similarity
self-join problem, as the most computationally intensive part of the algorithm
consists of computing distances in a multi-dimensional space. We find that the
performance gain from using the tensor core algorithm over the CUDA core
algorithm depends weakly on the dataset size and distribution, but is strongly
dependent on data dimensionality. Overall, TCs are a compelling alternative to
CUDA cores, particularly when the data dimensionality is low ($\leq{4}$), as we
achieve an average speedup of $1.28\times$ and up to $2.23\times$ against a
state-of-the-art GPU distance similarity self-join algorithm. Furthermore,
because this paper is among the first to explore the use of TCs for FP64
general-purpose computation, future research is promising.

consider several quenches, each of which is characterised by a corresponding
squeezed coherent state. In the quench action approach, the coherent state
amplitudes $K(\theta)$ become input data that fully characterise the large-time

as function of the mass of the unstable particle, the entropy growth rate has a
global minimum signalling the depletion of entropy that accompanies a slowdown
of stable quasiparticles at the threshold for the formation of an unstable
excitation. We also observe a separation of scales governed by the interplay
between the mass of the unstable particle and the quench parameter, separating
a non-interacting regime described by free fermions from an interacting regime
where the unstable particle is present. This separation of scales leads to a
double-plateau structure of many functions, where the relative height of the
plateaux is related to the ratio of central charges of the UV fixed points
associated with the two regimes, in full agreement with conformal field theory
predictions. The properties of several other functions of the entropy and its

However, the typical NFT auctioning procedures are conducted in various, ad hoc
ways, while mostly ignoring the context that the blockchain provides. One of
the main targets of this work is to shed light on the vastly unexplored design
space of NFT Auction Mechanisms, especially in those characteristics that
fundamentally differ from traditional and more contemporaneous forms of
auctions. We focus on the case that bidders have a valuation for the auctioned
NFT, i.e., what we term the single-item NFT auction case. In this setting, we
formally define an NFT Auction Mechanism, give the properties that we would
ideally like a perfect mechanism to satisfy (broadly known as incentive
compatibility and collusion resistance) and prove that it is impossible to have
such a perfect mechanism. Even though we cannot have an all-powerful protocol
like that, we move on to consider relaxed notions of those properties that we
may desire the protocol to satisfy, as a trade-off between implementability and
economic guarantees. Specifically, we define the notion of an
equilibrium-truthful auction, where neither the seller nor the bidders can
improve their utility by acting non-truthfully, so long as the counter-party
acts truthfully. We also define asymptotically second-price auctions, in which
the seller does not lose asymptotically any revenue in comparison to the
theoretically-optimal (static) second-price sealed-bid auction, in the case
that the bidders' valuations are drawn independently from some distribution. We
showcase why these two are very desirable properties for an auction mechanism
to enjoy, and construct the first known NFT Auction Mechanism which provably
possesses such formal guarantees.

in studies of cost-effectiveness and optimal decision-making. Maximum
likelihood estimation of these models can be challenging when data are
collected at a time interval longer than the model's transition cycle length.
For example, it may be necessary to estimate a monthly transition model from
data collected annually. The likelihood for a time-homogeneous Markov chain
with transition matrix $\mathbf{P}$ and data observed at intervals of $T$
cycles is a function of $\mathbf{P}^T.$ The maximum likelihood estimate of
$\mathbf{P}^T$ is easily obtained from the data. The $T$th root of this
estimate would then be a maximum likelihood estimate for $\mathbf{P}.$ However,
the $T$th root of $\mathbf{P}^T$ is not necessarily a valid transition matrix.
Maximum likelihood estimation of $\mathbf{P}$ is a constrained optimization
problem when a valid root is unavailable. The optimization problem is not
convex. Local convergence is explored in several case studies through graphical
representations of a grid search. The example cases use disease progression
data from the literature as well as synthetic data. The global maximum
likelihood estimate is increasingly difficult to locate as the number of cycles
or the number of states increases. What seems like a straightforward estimation
problem can be challenging even for relatively simple models. Researchers
should consider alternatives to likelihood maximization or alternative models.

searches for gravitational waves from the inspiral, merger and ringdown of
compact binaries. The method is based on a binary tree decomposition of the
template bank parameter space into non-overlapping hypercubes. We use a
numerical approximation of the signal overlap metric at the center of each
hypercube to estimate the number of templates required to cover the hypercube
and determine whether to further split the hypercube. As long as the expected
number of templates in a given cube is greater than a given threshold, we split
the cube along its longest edge according to the metric. When the expected
number of templates in a given hypercube drops below this threshold, the
splitting stops and a template is placed at the center of the hypercube. Using
this method, we generate aligned-spin template banks covering the mass range
suitable for a search of Advanced LIGO data. The aligned-spin bank required ~24
CPU-hours and produced 2 million templates. In general, we find that other
methods, namely stochastic placement, produces a more strictly bounded loss in
match between waveforms, with the same minimal match between waveforms
requiring about twice as many templates with our proposed algorithm. Though we
note that the average match is higher, which would lead to a higher detection
efficiency. Our primary motivation is not to strictly minimize the number of
templates with this algorithm, but rather to produce a bank with useful
geometric properties in the physical parameter space coordinates. Such
properties are useful for population modeling and parameter estimation.

post-processing snapshots taken during the colonoscopy procedure, for
maintaining medical records or further investigation. Automating this step can
save time and improve the efficiency of the process. In our work, we have
collected a dataset of 120 colonoscopy videos and 2416 snapshots taken during
the procedure, that have been annotated by experts. Further, we have developed
a novel, vision-transformer based landmark detection algorithm that identifies
key anatomical landmarks (the appendiceal orifice, ileocecal valve/cecum
landmark and rectum retroflexion) from snapshots taken during colonoscopy. Our
algorithm uses an adaptive gamma correction during preprocessing to maintain a
consistent brightness for all images. We then use a vision transformer as the
feature extraction backbone and a fully connected network based classifier head
to categorize a given frame into four classes: the three landmarks or a
non-landmark frame. We compare the vision transformer (ViT-B/16) backbone with
ResNet-101 and ConvNext-B backbones that have been trained similarly. We report
an accuracy of 82% with the vision transformer backbone on a test dataset of
snapshots.

incorporate the artistic ""style"" of one image to the ""content"" of another. The
underlying theory behind the approach relies on the assumption that the style
of an image is represented by the Gram matrix of its features, which is
typically extracted from pre-trained convolutional neural networks (e.g.,
VGG-19). This idea does not straightforwardly extend to time series stylization
since notions of style for two-dimensional images are not analogous to notions
of style for one-dimensional time series. In this work, a novel formulation of
time series style transfer is proposed for the purpose of synthetic data
generation and enhancement. We introduce the concept of stylized features for
time series, which is directly related to the time series realism properties,
and propose a novel stylization algorithm, called StyleTime, that uses explicit
feature extraction techniques to combine the underlying content (trend) of one
time series with the style (distributional properties) of another. Further, we
discuss evaluation metrics, and compare our work to existing state-of-the-art
time series generation and augmentation schemes. To validate the effectiveness
of our methods, we use stylized synthetic data as a means for data augmentation
to improve the performance of recurrent neural network models on several

due to its low cost and fast mobility. With the increasing volume of aerial
videos, the demand for automatically parsing these videos is surging. To
achieve this, current researches mainly focus on extracting a holistic feature
with convolutions along both spatial and temporal dimensions. However, these
methods are limited by small temporal receptive fields and cannot adequately
capture long-term temporal dependencies which are important for describing
complicated dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network,
termed FuTH-Net, to model not only holistic features, but also temporal
relations for aerial video classification. Furthermore, the holistic features
are refined by the multi-scale temporal relations in a novel fusion module for
yielding more discriminative video representations. More specially, FuTH-Net
employs a two-pathway architecture: (1) a holistic representation pathway to
learn a general feature of both frame appearances and shortterm temporal
variations and (2) a temporal relation pathway to capture multi-scale temporal
relations across arbitrary frames, providing long-term temporal dependencies.
Afterwards, a novel fusion module is proposed to spatiotemporal integrate the
two features learned from the two pathways. Our model is evaluated on two
aerial video classification datasets, ERA and Drone-Action, and achieves the
state-of-the-art results. This demonstrates its effectiveness and good
generalization capacity across different recognition tasks (event
classification and human action recognition). To facilitate further research,

the production of entanglement and overcome the deleterious effects that
initial thermal fluctuations have on the output entanglement. To make further

correlations between Hawking pairs. The techniques that we employ are generally
applicable to analog gravity setups of (Gaussian) bosonic quantum systems, such

robust communications in highly-mobile scenarios. Estimating the channels for
OTFS systems, however, is associated with high pilot signaling overhead that
scales with the maximum delay and Doppler spreads. This becomes particularly
challenging for massive MIMO systems where the overhead also scales with the
number of antennas. An important observation however is that the delay,
Doppler, and angle of departure/arrival information are directly related to the
distance, velocity, and direction information of the mobile user and the
various scatterers in the environment. With this motivation, we propose to
leverage radar sensing to obtain this information about the mobile users and
scatterers in the environment and leverage it to aid the OTFS channel
estimation in massive MIMO systems.
  As one approach to realize our vision, this paper formulates the OTFS channel
estimation problem in massive MIMO systems as a sparse recovery problem and
utilizes the radar sensing information to determine the support (locations of
the non-zero delay-Doppler taps). The proposed radar sensing aided sparse
recovery algorithm is evaluated based on an accurate 3D ray-tracing framework
with co-existing radar and communication data. The results show that the
developed sensing-aided solution consistently outperforms the standard sparse
recovery algorithms (that do not leverage radar sensing data) and leads to a
significant reduction in the pilot overhead, which highlights a promising
direction for OTFS based massive MIMO systems.

methods to analyze their performance in the presence of error. We introduce a

to a noise threshold, below which arbitrarily high accuracy can be achieved by
increasing the number of samples used in the algorithm. As an application of

omni-directional and directional path loss models have been developed, based on
the so-called close-in (CI) free-space reference distance model. Moreover, path
loss modeling has been applied for the 2nd and 3rd strongest multipath
components (MPCs), based on which path loss exponent and large-scale shadow
fading estimates have been derived. A power angular spread analysis is further
presented, using up to the 3rd strongest MPC. Finally, results on the sparsity
of the wireless channel have also been presented by employing the so-called
Gini index.

including Chandra, HST, and Subaru. HST imaging boasts very high spatial
resolution and is used extensively in morphological studies of distant
galaxies. Subaru provides lower spatial resolution imaging than HST but a
substantially wider field of view with greater sensitivity. Both telescopes
provide near-infrared imaging of COSMOS. Successful morphological fitting of
Subaru data would allow us to measure morphologies of over $10^4$ known active
galactic nucleus (AGN) hosts, accessible through Subaru wide-field surveys,
currently not covered by HST. For 4016 AGN between $0.03<z<6.5$, we study the
morphology of their galaxy hosts using GALFIT, fitting components representing
the AGN and host galaxy simultaneously using the i-band imaging from both HST
and Subaru. Comparing the fits for the differing telescope spatial resolutions
and image signal-to-noise ratios, we identify parameter regimes for which there
is strong disagreement between distributions of fitted parameters for HST and
Subaru. In particular, the S\'ersic index values strongly disagree between the
two sets of data, including sources at lower redshifts. In contrast, the
measured magnitude and radius parameters show reasonable agreement.
Additionally, large variations in the S\'ersic index have little effect on the
$\chi^2_\nu$ of each fit whereas variations in other parameters have a more
significant effect. These results indicate that the S\'ersic index
distributions of high-redshift galaxies that host AGN imaged at ground-based
spatial resolution are not reliable indicators of galaxy type, and should be
interpreted with caution.

foundations of many applications with the potential for such a speedup. While
these algorithms, in theory, obtain marvelous performance, deploying them on
existing quantum devices is a challenging task. For example, quantum phase
estimation requires extra qubits and a large number of controlled operations,
which are impractical due to low-qubit and noisy hardware. To fully utilize the
limited onboard qubits, we propose IQuCS, which aims at index searching and

filter out unlikely data points iteratively. A reduced data set is fed to the

IQuCS requires fewer qubits iteratively, which provides the potential for a

intensive experiments. The results demonstrate that it reduces qubits

metallicity and vertical velocity as compared to the surrounding regions in

this, we develop a method to estimate the age distribution of sub-populations
of stars. In this method, we use GALAH data to define probability distributions
of W vs. [M/H] in age bins of 2 Gyr and determine optimal age distributions as
the best fit weighted sum of these distributions. This process is then
validated using the GALAH subset. We estimate the probable age distribution for
regions in the kinematic plane, where we find significant sub-structure that is
correlated with the kinematic groups. Most notably, we find an age gradient
across the Hercules streams that is correlated with birth radius. Finally, we
examine the bending and breathing modes as a function of age. From this, we
observe potential hints of an increase in the bending amplitude with age, which
will require further analysis in order to confirm it. This is one of the first

Compared to sensor-based solutions, vision-based localization does not require
pre-installed sensor infrastructure, which is costly, time-consuming, and/or
often infeasible at scale. Herein, we propose a novel vision-based localization
pipeline for a specific use case: navigation support for end-users with
blindness and low vision. Given a query image taken by an end-user on a mobile
application, the pipeline leverages a visual place recognition (VPR) algorithm
to find similar images in a reference image database of the target space. The
geolocations of these similar images are utilized in downstream tasks that
employ a weighted-average method to estimate the end-user's location and a
perspective-n-point (PnP) algorithm to estimate the end-user's direction.
Additionally, this system implements Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate a
shortest path based on a navigable map that includes trip origin and
destination. The topometric map used for localization and navigation is built
using a customized graphical user interface that projects a 3D reconstructed
sparse map, built from a sequence of images, to the corresponding a priori 2D
floor plan. Sequential images used for map construction can be collected in a
pre-mapping step or scavenged through public databases/citizen science. The
end-to-end system can be installed on any internet-accessible device with a
camera that hosts a custom mobile application. For evaluation purposes, mapping
and localization were tested in a complex hospital environment. The evaluation
results demonstrate that our system can achieve localization with an average
error of less than 1 meter without knowledge of the camera's intrinsic
parameters, such as focal length.

under intense discussion despite the multitude of approaches proposed. Here, we
define a selection criterion based on the use of polaronic defect states for
the enforcement of the piecewise linearity of the total energy upon electron
occupation. A good agreement with results from piecewise linear hybrid
functionals is found for the electronic and structural properties of polarons,
including the formation energies. The values of $U$ determined in this way are
found to give a robust description of the polaron energetics upon variation of
the considered state. In particular, we also address a polaron hopping pathway,
finding that the determined value of $U$ leads to accurate energetics without
requiring a configurational-dependent $U$. It is emphasized that the selection
of $U$ should be based on physical properties directly associated with the
orbitals to which $U$ is applied, rather than on more global properties such as
band gaps and band widths. For comparison, we also determine $U$ through a
well-established linear-response scheme finding noticeably different values of
$U$ and consequently different formation energies. Possible origins of these
discrepancies are discussed. As case studies, we consider the self-trapped

  Measurement",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The abundant spatial and angular information from light fields has allowed
the development of multiple disparity estimation approaches. However, the
acquisition of light fields requires high storage and processing cost, limiting
the use of this technology in practical applications. To overcome these
drawbacks, the compressive sensing (CS) theory has allowed the development of
optical architectures to acquire a single coded light field measurement. This
measurement is decoded using an optimization algorithm or deep neural network
that requires high computational costs. The traditional approach for disparity
estimation from compressed light fields requires first recovering the entire
light field and then a post-processing step, thus requiring long times. In
contrast, this work proposes a fast disparity estimation from a single
compressed measurement by omitting the recovery step required in traditional
approaches. Specifically, we propose to jointly optimize an optical
architecture for acquiring a single coded light field snapshot and a
convolutional neural network (CNN) for estimating the disparity maps.
Experimentally, the proposed method estimates disparity maps comparable with

While the geometry of the dopants can be defined to sub-nanometer precision,
imperfections can still play a significant role in determining the tunneling
rates. Here, we investigate the influence of different imperfections in
phosphorous $\delta$-layer tunnel junctions in silicon: variations of
$\delta$-layer thickness and tunnel gap width, interface roughness, and charged
impurities. It is found that while most of the imperfections moderately affect
the tunneling rate, a single charged impurity in the tunnel gap can alter the
tunneling rate by more than an order of magnitude, even for relatively large
tunnel gaps. Moreover, it is also revealed that the tunneling rate strongly

Using this method we can tackle the major issues in training transformer vision

main-sequence stars, as expected. However, the stellar primaries tend to be
more massive (i.e., corresponding to spectral types A, F, and G) than expected

less pronounced. Tertiary stellar components are almost exclusively low-mass

active area of research as bad initialization might deteriorate the quality of

the circuit depth. Then, we discuss on the symmetries and periodicity of the

the patterns in optimal parameters and the bounds restriction, we propose a
strategy which predicts the new initial parameters by taking the difference
between previous optimal parameters. Unlike most other strategies, the strategy
we propose does not require multiple trials to ensure success. It only requires
one prediction when progressing to the next depth. We compare this strategy
with our previously proposed strategy and the layerwise strategy on solving the

Detection & is important for various real-world applications like medical
application, autonomous driving, etc. Open Set Detection within context of deep
learning involves solving two problems: (i) Must map the input images into a
latent representation that contains enough information to detect the outliers,
and (ii) Must learn an anomaly scoring function that can extract this
information from the latent representation to identify the anomalies. Research
in deep anomaly detection methods has progressed slowly. One reason may be that
most papers simultaneously introduce new representation learning techniques and
new anomaly scoring approaches. The goal of this work is to improve this
methodology by providing ways of separately measuring the effectiveness of the
representation learning and anomaly scoring. This work makes two methodological
contributions. The first is to introduce the notion of Oracle anomaly detection
for quantifying the information available in a learned latent representation.
The second is to introduce Oracle representation learning, which produces a
representation that is guaranteed to be sufficient for accurate anomaly
detection. These two techniques help researchers to separate the quality of the
learned representation from the performance of the anomaly scoring mechanism so
that they can debug and improve their systems. The methods also provide an
upper limit on how much open category detection can be improved through better
anomaly scoring mechanisms. The combination of the two oracles gives an upper
limit on the performance that any open category detection method could achieve.
This work introduces these two oracle techniques and demonstrates their utility
by applying them to several leading open category detection methods.

extremely high. These results provide us with a way to anticipate the extent to

factor is the lack of labeled data, as obtaining expert annotations for each
new set of imaging data or task can be expensive, labor intensive, and
inconsistent across annotators. Thus, we utilize self-supervision from pixels
and their local neighborhoods in the images themselves. Our unsupervised
approach optimizes a training objective that leverages concepts from
contrastive learning and autoencoding. In contrast to prior work, our framework
segments medical images with a novel two-stage approach without relying on any
labeled data at any stage. The first stage involves the creation of a
""pixel-centered patch"" that embeds every pixel along with its surrounding
patch, using a vector representation in a high-dimensional latent embedding
space. The second stage utilizes diffusion condensation, a multi-scale
topological data analysis approach, to dynamically coarse-grain these embedding
vectors at all levels of granularity. The final outcome is a series of
coarse-to-fine segmentations that highlight image structures at various scales.
We show successful multi-scale segmentation on natural images, retinal fundus
images, and brain MRI images. Our framework delineates structures and patterns
at different scales which may carry distinct information relevant to clinical
interpretation. As we tackle the problem of segmenting medical images at
multiple meaningful granularities without relying on any label, we demonstrate
the possibility to circumvent tedious and repetitive manual annotations in

approach pulls samples of the same class with similar data features closer in
the projection, leading to more compact (significant) and class-consistent

Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to approximate the posterior distribution of

to instabilities during optimization or may yield poor generalizations. To
overcome these limitations, we examine the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence that
is bounded, symmetric, and more general. Towards this, we propose two novel
loss functions for BNNs. The first loss function uses the geometric JS
divergence (JS-G) that is symmetric, unbounded, and offers an analytical
expression for Gaussian priors. The second loss function uses the generalized
JS divergence (JS-A) that is symmetric and bounded. We show that the
conventional KL divergence-based loss function is a special case of the two
loss functions presented in this work. To evaluate the divergence part of the
loss we use analytical expressions for JS-G and use Monte Carlo methods for
JS-A. We provide algorithms to optimize the loss function using both these
methods. The proposed loss functions offer additional parameters that can be
tuned to control the degree of regularisation. The regularization performance
of the JS divergences is analyzed to demonstrate their superiority over the
state-of-the-art. Further, we derive the conditions for better regularization

modelling to prevent collision events that threaten access to space
infrastructure. Ionospheric aerodynamics are the largest non-conservative
source of orbital perturbations. Work done by Brown et al provided a prediction
method for drag forces on charged bodies in low earth orbit based on applying
approximations of single species flows to representative plasma simulations.
Recent work on mixed species plasma sheaths motivates investigation of this
assumption. Mixed species plasma flows over charged bodies with representative
LEO conditions were simulated, focusing on orbital motion limited O$^+$
dominated flows, and sheath limited H$^+$ dominated flows. The significance of
small concentrations of different ion species was analysed in terms of
aerodynamic effects on the body. Introduction of small concentrations of H$^+$
into a flow dominated by O$^+$ molecules showed significant disruptions to the
wake structure, coupled with an increase in drag coefficient for a satellite in
that flow. Introducing heavier O$^+$ molecules into a sheath dominated H$^+$
flow found little disruption to the wake structure. A multi-species drag model
was proposed, building on work in Brown et al. This model was found to
qualitatively describe changes in wake structure, but consistently over
predicted drag coefficients. This finding suggests that the influence of mixed
species flows on ionospheric aerodynamics involves significant contributions
from inter-species interactions not described adequately by considering the
separate species as either separate flows, or one flow with adjusted
parameters.

weighted linear outcome quantile regression. At the sample level, we develop
new methods and theory for obtaining not only doubly robust point estimators
for the relaxed population bounds with respect to misspecification of a
propensity score model or an outcome mean regression model, but also
model-assisted confidence intervals which are valid if the propensity score
model is correctly specified, but the outcome quantile and mean regression
models may be misspecified. The relaxed population bounds reduce to the sharp
bounds if outcome quantile regression is correctly specified. For a linear
outcome mean regression model, the confidence intervals are also doubly robust.
Our methods involve regularized calibrated estimation, with Lasso penalties but
carefully chosen loss functions, for fitting propensity score and outcome mean
and quantile regression models. We present a simulation study and an empirical
application to an observational study on the effects of right heart
catheterization.

scaling law of the outage probability of HARQ-aided NOMA systems with respect
to the transmit power, i.e., diversity order. The analysis of diversity order
is carried out for three basic types of HARQ-aided downlink NOMA systems,
including Type I HARQ, HARQ with chase combining (HARQ-CC) and HARQ with
incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR). The diversity orders of three HARQ-aided
downlink NOMA systems are derived in closed-form, where an integration domain
partition trick is developed to obtain the bounds of the outage probability
specially for HARQ-CC and HARQ-IR-aided NOMA systems. The analytical results
show that the diversity order is a decreasing step function of transmission
rate, and full time diversity can only be achieved under a sufficiently low
transmission rate. It is also revealed that HARQ-IR-aided NOMA systems have the
largest diversity order, followed by HARQ-CC-aided and then Type I HARQ-aided
NOMA systems. Additionally, the users' diversity orders follow a descending

web videos. Most existing methods assume that the video frames and text
description are semantically correlated, and focus on video-language modeling
at video level. However, this hypothesis often fails for two reasons: (1) With
the rich semantics of video contents, it is difficult to cover all frames with
a single video-level description; (2) A raw video typically has
noisy/meaningless information (e.g., scenery shot, transition or teaser).
Although a number of recent works deploy attention mechanism to alleviate this
problem, the irrelevant/noisy information still makes it very difficult to
address. To overcome such challenge, we thus propose an efficient and effective
model, termed Language-Guided Denoising Network (LGDN), for video-language
modeling. Different from most existing methods that utilize all extracted video
frames, LGDN dynamically filters out the misaligned or redundant frames under
the language supervision and obtains only 2--4 salient frames per video for
cross-modal token-level alignment. Extensive experiments on five public
datasets show that our LGDN outperforms the state-of-the-arts by large margins.
We also provide detailed ablation study to reveal the critical importance of
solving the noise issue, in hope of inspiring future video-language work.

derived in closed-form by taking into account two grouping policies, including
random grouping and distance-based grouping. It is revealed that the average
outage probabilities are irrelevant to the intensity of BSs in the
interference-limited regime, while the outage performance deteriorates if the
intensity is sufficiently low. Besides, as the channel uncertainty lessens, the
asymptotic analyses manifest that the target rates must be restricted up to a
bound to achieve an arbitrarily low outage probability in the absence of the
inter-cell interference.Moreover, highly correlated estimation error
ameliorates the outage performance under a low quality of CSI, otherwise it
behaves oppositely. Afterwards, the goodput is maximized by choosing
appropriate precoding matrix, receiver filters and transmission rates. In the

image-guided radiation therapy to provide volumetric images with high spatial
and temporal resolutions to enable applications including tumor motion
tracking/prediction and intra-delivery dose calculation/accumulation. However,
the dynamic CBCT reconstruction is a substantially challenging spatiotemporal
inverse problem, due to the extremely limited projection sample available for
each CBCT reconstruction (one projection for one CBCT volume). Approach: We
developed a simultaneous spatial and temporal implicit neural representation
(STINR) method for dynamic CBCT reconstruction. STINR mapped the unknown image
and the evolution of its motion into spatial and temporal multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs), and iteratively optimized the neuron weighting of the MLPs
via acquired projections to represent the dynamic CBCT series. In addition to
the MLPs, we also introduced prior knowledge, in form of principal component
analysis (PCA)-based patient-specific motion models, to reduce the complexity
of the temporal INRs to address the ill-conditioned dynamic CBCT reconstruction
problem. We used the extended cardiac torso (XCAT) phantom to simulate
different lung motion/anatomy scenarios to evaluate STINR. The scenarios
contain motion variations including motion baseline shifts, motion
amplitude/frequency variations, and motion non-periodicity. The scenarios also
contain inter-scan anatomical variations including tumor shrinkage and tumor
position change. Main results: STINR shows consistently higher image
reconstruction and motion tracking accuracy than a traditional PCA-based method
and a polynomial-fitting based neural representation method. STINR tracks the
lung tumor to an averaged center-of-mass error of <2 mm, with corresponding
relative errors of reconstructed dynamic CBCTs <10%.

morphology of gas clusters varies between drainage and imbibition paths and is
the underlying source of the hysteresis. During drainage, gas clusters
congregate at the grain surface; the local suction increases when gas clusters
enter through small pore openings and decreases when gas clusters enter through
large pore openings. Whereas, during imbibition, gas clusters disperse in the
liquid; the local suction decreases uniformly. Large pores empty first during
drainage and small pores fill first during imbibition. The pore-based WRC shows
that an increase in pore size causes a decrease in suction during drainage and

sampling frame rate of the input stream. In fact, we empirically found that the
accuracy of all recent state-of-the-art trackers drops dramatically when the
input frame rate changes. For a more intelligent tracking solution, we shift
the attention of our research work to the problem of Frame Rate Agnostic MOT
(FraMOT), which takes frame rate insensitivity into consideration. In this
paper, we propose a Frame Rate Agnostic MOT framework with a Periodic training
Scheme (FAPS) to tackle the FraMOT problem for the first time. Specifically, we
propose a Frame Rate Agnostic Association Module (FAAM) that infers and encodes
the frame rate information to aid identity matching across multi-frame-rate
inputs, improving the capability of the learned model in handling complex
motion-appearance relations in FraMOT. Moreover, the association gap between
training and inference is enlarged in FraMOT because those post-processing
steps not included in training make a larger difference in lower frame rate
scenarios. To address it, we propose Periodic Training Scheme (PTS) to reflect
all post-processing steps in training via tracking pattern matching and fusion.
Along with the proposed approaches, we make the first attempt to establish an
evaluation method for this new task of FraMOT in two different modes, i.e.,
known frame rate and unknown frame rate, aiming to handle a more complex
situation. The quantitative experiments on the challenging MOT17/20 dataset
(FraMOT version) have clearly demonstrated that the proposed approaches can
handle different frame rates better and thus improve the robustness against
complicated scenarios.

reach its functional state and its efficacious working region in its functional
state. Here, we provide a set of design principles for the system, which are

any autonomous demon system to its functional periodic steady state at a
fastest pace for any initial distribution through resetting the demon for a

hand, the system can reach a new functional state when the resetting is always
on, in which case the efficacious region of the demon being extended
significantly. Moreover, a dual function region in a new phase diagram of the

the proposed algorithm is validated under line-of-sight (LoS) channel
conditions, and the irreducible MSE floor effect induced by imperfections of
both hardware and CSI is also revealed in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)

increasingly critical for maintaining complex production systems. Robust and
explainable strategies help decrease system downtime and preempt or mitigate
infrastructure cyberattacks. This work begins by explaining the types of
uncertainty present in current datasets and machine learning algorithm outputs.
Three techniques for combating these uncertainties are then introduced and
analyzed. We further present two anomaly detection and classification
approaches, namely the Matrix Profile algorithm and anomaly transformer, which
are applied in the context of a power electronic converter dataset.
Specifically, the Matrix Profile algorithm is shown to be well suited as a
generalizable approach for detecting real-time anomalies in streaming
time-series data. The STUMPY python library implementation of the iterative
Matrix Profile is used for the creation of the detector. A series of custom
filters is created and added to the detector to tune its sensitivity, recall,
and detection accuracy. Our numerical results show that, with simple parameter
tuning, the detector provides high accuracy and performance in a variety of
fault scenarios.

can realize quantum repeaters that enable fast entanglement distribution rates
approaching classical communication. However, the generation of these photonic
graph states requires a formidable resource overhead using traditional
approaches based on linear optics. Overcoming this challenge, a number of new
schemes have been proposed that employ quantum emitters to deterministically
generate photonic graph states. Although these schemes have the potential to
significantly reduce the resource cost, a systematic comparison of the repeater
performance among different encodings and different generation schemes is
lacking. Here, we quantitatively analyze the performance of quantum repeaters
based on two different graph states, i.e. the tree graph states and the
repeater graph states. For both states, we compare the performance between two
generation schemes, one based on a single quantum emitter coupled to ancillary
matter qubits, and one based on a single quantum emitter coupled to a delayed
feedback. We identify the numerically optimal scheme at different system
parameters. Our analysis provides a clear guideline on the selection of the
generation scheme for graph-state-based quantum repeaters, and lays out the
parameter requirements for future experimental realizations of different
schemes.

(OSR) assumes the presence of an unknown class, which is not seen to a model
during training. One predominant approach in OSR is metric learning, where a
model is trained to separate the inter-class representations of known class
data. Numerous works in OSR reported that, even though the models are trained
only with the known class data, the models become aware of the unknown, and
learn to separate the unknown class representations from the known class
representations. This paper analyzes this emergent phenomenon by observing the
Jacobian norm of representation. We theoretically show that minimizing the
intra-class distances within the known set reduces the Jacobian norm of known
class representations while maximizing the inter-class distances within the
known set increases the Jacobian norm of the unknown class. The closed-set
metric learning thus separates the unknown from the known by forcing their
Jacobian norm values to differ. We empirically validate our theoretical
framework with ample pieces of evidence using standard OSR datasets. Moreover,
under our theoretical framework, we explain how the standard deep learning
techniques can be helpful for OSR and use the framework as a guiding principle
to develop an effective OSR model.

agreement is found between the theory and experiment on the peculiar
experimental observation of STE emission with a nearly constant spectral
bandwidth but linearly increasing energy with pressure below 2 GPa. Further
analysis by the theory and experiment under higher pressure reveals that two
types of STE are involved and respond differently to external pressure. We
subsequently survey published STE emissions and discovered that most of them

identification of an appropriate theoretical model and its application to STE
emission through the coordinate configuration diagram paves the way for
engineering the STE emission and basic understanding of electron-phonon

multivariate spaces, naturally inducing a multivariate generalisation of
quantiles. The halfspace depth of a point with respect to a measure is defined
as the infimum mass of closed halfspaces that contain the given point. In
general, a closed halfspace that attains that infimum does not have to exist.
We introduce a flag halfspace - an intermediary between a closed halfspace and
its interior. We demonstrate that the halfspace depth can be equivalently
formulated also in terms of flag halfspaces, and that there always exists a
flag halfspace whose boundary passes through any given point $x$, and has mass
exactly equal to the halfspace depth of $x$. Flag halfspaces allow us to derive
theoretical results regarding the halfspace depth without the need to
differentiate absolutely continuous measures from measures containing atoms, as
was frequently done previously. The notion of flag halfspaces is used to state
results on the dimensionality of the halfspace median set for random samples.
We prove that under mild conditions, the dimension of the sample halfspace
median set of $d$-variate data cannot be $d-1$, and that for $d=2$ the sample
halfspace median set must be either a two-dimensional convex polygon, or a data
point. The latter result guarantees that the computational algorithm for the

applications. While authoring such dynamic garment geometry is still a
challenging task, data-driven simulation provides an attractive alternative,

especially for loose garments. In a data-driven setup, we first learn a
generative space of plausible garment geometries. Then, we learn a mapping to
this space to capture the motion dependent dynamic deformations, conditioned on
the previous state of the garment as well as its relative position with respect
to the underlying body. Technically, we model garment dynamics, driven using
the input character motion, by predicting per-frame local displacements in a
canonical state of the garment that is enriched with frame-dependent skinning
weights to bring the garment to the global space. We resolve any remaining
per-frame collisions by predicting residual local displacements. The resultant
garment geometry is used as history to enable iterative rollout prediction. We
demonstrate plausible generalization to unseen body shapes and motion inputs,
and show improvements over multiple state-of-the-art alternatives.

transborder data flow has attracted sufficient attention from global digital
regulators. However, there is missing a technical approach for the audit
practice due to two technical challenges. Firstly, there is a lack of theory
and tools for measuring the information of sensitive latent features in a
dataset. Secondly, the transborder data flow involves multi-stakeholders with
diverse interests, which means the audit must be trustless. Despite the
tremendous efforts in protecting data privacy, an important issue that has long
been neglected is that the transmitted data in data flows can leak other
regulated information that is not explicitly contained in the data, leading to
unaware information leakage risks. To unveil such risks trustfully before the
actual data transfer, we propose FIAT, a Fine-grained Information Audit system
for Trustless transborder data flow. In FIAT, we use a learning approach to
quantify the amount of information leakage, while the technologies of
zero-knowledge proof and smart contracts are applied to provide trustworthy and
privacy-preserving auditing results. Experiments show that large information
leakage can boost the predictability of uninvolved information using simple
machine-learning models, revealing the importance of information auditing.
Further performance benchmarking also validates the efficiency and scalability
of the FIAT auditing system.

smartphones. However, UDC captured images suffer from severe degradation since
sensors lie under the display. Although this issue can be tackled by image
restoration networks, these networks require large-scale image pairs for

the generative adversarial network (GAN) framework for simulating UDC imaging.
Specifically, we note that the UDC imaging degradation process contains
brightness attenuation, blurring, and noise corruption. Thus we model each
degradation with a characteristic-related modular network, and all modular
networks are cascaded to form the generator. Together with a pixel-wise
discriminator and supervised loss, we can train the generator to simulate the

X-ray binary triggers X-ray bursts, whose ashes are buried and further
processed thus altering the composition and the properties of the stellar
crust. In this second paper of a series, the impact of accretion on the
equation of state and on the global properties of neutron stars is studied in
the framework of the nuclear energy-density functional theory. Considering
ashes made of $^{56}$Fe, we calculated the equations of state using the same
Brussels-Montreal nuclear energy-density functionals BSk19, BSk20, and BSk21,
as those already employed for determining the crustal heating in our previous
study for the same ashes. All regions of accreting neutron stars were treated
in a unified and thermodynamically consistent way. With these equations of
state, we determined the mass, radius, moment of inertia, and tidal
deformability of accreted neutron stars and compared with catalyzed neutron
stars for which unified equations of state based on the same functionals are
available. The equation of state of accreted neutron stars is found to be
significantly stiffer than that of catalyzed matter, with an adiabatic index
$\Gamma \approx 4/3$ throughout the crust. For this reason, accreting neutron
stars have larger radii. However, their crustal moment of inertia and their
tidal deformability are hardly changed provided density discontinuities at the
interface between adjacent crustal layers are properly taken into account. The
enhancement of the stiffness of the equation of state of accreting neutron
stars is mainly a consequence of nuclear shell effects, thus confirming the
importance of a quantum treatment as stressed in our first study. With our
previous calculations of crustal heating using the same functionals, we have
thus obtained consistent microscopic inputs for simulations of accreting
neutron stars.

We find that models adapted using TeST significantly improve over baseline

short-term behavior sequence to predict the next item without the detailed user
profile. Most recent works try to model the user preference by treating the
sessions as between-item transition graphs and utilize various graph neural
networks (GNNs) to encode the representations of pair-wise relations among
items and their neighbors. Some of the existing GNN-based models mainly focus
on aggregating information from the view of spatial graph structure, which
ignores the temporal relations within neighbors of an item during message
passing and the information loss results in a sub-optimal problem. Other works
embrace this challenge by incorporating additional temporal information but
lack sufficient interaction between the spatial and temporal patterns. To
address this issue, inspired by the uniformity and alignment properties of
contrastive learning techniques, we propose a novel framework called
Session-based Recommendation with Spatio-Temporal Contrastive Learning Enhanced

recommendation task with the temporal representation via an auxiliary

transmits only open messages. We provide an achievable rate region and show
that by introducing `garbage' messages and applying random coding, simultaneous
information transmission and cooperative jamming (SIT-CJ) can be achieved,
i.e., user $2$ can transmit useful information to the legitimate receiver and
at the same time act as a friendly jammer for user $1$. To evaluate the
performance of SIT-CJ, we maximize the secrecy rate and compare with the
No-jamming case, where there is only user $1$, and also the Gaussian noise (GN)
jamming scheme, where user $2$ jams by transmitting Gaussian noise. For the
SIMO case, we prove that though non-convex, the power control problems for all
jamming schemes can be optimally solved. Things are much more complicated in
the MIMO case. However, we show that by using matrix simultaneous
diagonalization, all precoder design problems can be efficiently solved with a
low complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed SIT-CJ scheme can
help greatly enhance the secrecy of user $1$, and outperforms the GN-jamming
scheme in secrecy improvement. Moreover, since besides confidential
information, all users transmit open messages, the system's spectral efficiency
can be dramatically increased by SIT-CJ compared with the GN-jamming scheme and
also the case where only secret messages of user $1$ are considered.

fabricate nanostructures. Polymers that are reported to undergo microphase
separation usually include block copolymers or polyelectrolytes. Neutral
homopolymers, which are comparatively easy to synthesize, are thought to be
incapable of microphase separation. Here, using a minimal model that accounts
for ion solvation, we show that microphase separation is possible in neutral
homopolymer blends with sufficient dielectric contrast, upon a tiny amount of
salt-doping. The driving force for the microphase separation is the competition
between selective ion solvation, which places smaller ions in domains with
higher dielectric constant, and the propensity for local charge neutrality to
decrease the electrostatic energy. The compromise is an emergent length over
which microphase separation occurs and ions are selectively solvated. The
factors affecting such competitions are explored, including ion solvation
radii, dielectric contrast, and polymer fraction, which point to directions for
observing this behavior experimentally. These findings suggest a low-cost and
facile alternative to produce microphase separation which may be exploited in
advanced material design and preparation.

boundaries are unavailable, is a challenging continual learning setting. One
representative kind of methods for online continual learning is replay-based
methods, in which a replay buffer called memory is maintained to keep a small
part of past samples for overcoming catastrophic forgetting. When tackling with
online continual learning, most existing replay-based methods focus on
single-label problems in which each sample in the data stream has only one
label. But multi-label problems may also happen in the online continual
learning setting in which each sample may have more than one label. In the
online setting with multi-label samples, the class distribution in data stream
is typically highly imbalanced, and it is challenging to control class
distribution in memory since changing the number of samples belonging to one
class may affect the number of samples belonging to other classes. But class
distribution in memory is critical for replay-based memory to get good
performance, especially when the class distribution in data stream is highly
imbalanced. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method, called
optimizing class distribution in memory (OCDM), for multi-label online
continual learning. OCDM formulates the memory update mechanism as an
optimization problem and updates the memory by solving this problem.
Experiments on two widely used multi-label datasets show that OCDM can control

be the world's brightest cold pulsed spallation neutron source. The facility
uses a 2GeV proton beam hitting a target to produce neutrons. The neutrons are
then thermalized in a moderator. Surrounding the moderator are several beam
ports connected to neutron guides that transport the cold neutrons. Due to the
long-pulse source nature of the ESS, neutron scattering instruments are
significantly longer than at most existing facilities, with approximately half
the instruments requiring neutron guides that are 150 meters long and only a
few shorter than 50 meters. Therefore the shielding cost is dominated by the
guide shielding. To fulfill the shielding requirement, a 'Common Shielding
Project' has been initiated to deliver cost-effective and standardized
solutions for several instruments. This includes both a consistent design of
the shielding blocks, as well as a common approach to neutronics simulations.

recommendation systems have not fully utilized such contextual background
knowledge. Traditional recommendation systems (RS) mostly enrich user-item
interactions where the context consists of static user profiles and item
descriptions, ignoring the contextual logic and constraints that underlie them.
For example, an RS may recommend an item on the condition that the user has
interacted with another item as its prerequisite. Modeling prerequisite context
from conceptual side information can overcome this weakness. We propose
Prerequisite Driven Recommendation (PDR), a generic context-aware framework
where prerequisite context is explicitly modeled to facilitate recommendation.
We first design a Prerequisite Knowledge Linking (PKL) algorithm, to curate
datasets facilitating PDR research. Employing it, we build a 75k+ high-quality
prerequisite concept dataset which spans three domains. We then contribute
PDRS, a neural instantiation of PDR. By jointly optimizing both the
prerequisite learning and recommendation tasks through multi-layer perceptrons,
we find PDRS consistently outperforms baseline models in all three domains, by
an average margin of 7.41%. Importantly, PDRS performs especially well in
cold-start scenarios with improvements of up to 17.65%.

unsupervised hashing methods have been proposed by designing a semantic
similarity matrix, which is based on the similarities between image features
extracted by a pre-trained CNN model. However, most of these methods tend to
ignore high-level abstract semantic concepts contained in images. Intuitively,
concepts play an important role in calculating the similarity among images. In
real-world scenarios, each image is associated with some concepts, and the
similarity between two images will be larger if they share more identical
concepts. Inspired by the above intuition, in this work, we propose a novel
Unsupervised Hashing with Semantic Concept Mining, called UHSCM, which
leverages a VLP model to construct a high-quality similarity matrix.
Specifically, a set of randomly chosen concepts is first collected. Then, by
employing a vision-language pretraining (VLP) model with the prompt engineering
which has shown strong power in visual representation learning, the set of
concepts is denoised according to the training images. Next, the proposed
method UHSCM applies the VLP model with prompting again to mine the concept
distribution of each image and construct a high-quality semantic similarity
matrix based on the mined concept distributions. Finally, with the semantic
similarity matrix as guiding information, a novel hashing loss with a modified
contrastive loss based regularization item is proposed to optimize the hashing
network. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the
proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in the image

$\Lambda$CDM model is one of the most exciting possibilities in modern
cosmology. The challenge of solving this problem is complicated by several
factors, including the worsening of the tension on $\sigma_8$ parameter when
that on $H_0$ is raised. Furthermore, the perspective from which the problem is
viewed should not be underestimated, since the tension on $H_0$ can also be
interpreted as a tension on the size of the acoustic horizon, $r_s$, which
deserves proper discussion. The common approach in the literature consists in
proposing a new model that can resolve the tension and treat the new parameters
of the theory as free in the analysis. However, allowing additional parameters
to vary often results in larger uncertainties on the inferred cosmological
parameters, causing an apparent relaxing in the tension due to the broaden in
the posterior, instead of a genuine shift in the central value of $H_{0}$. To
avoid this, we consider here an empirical approach that assumes specific
non-standard values of the $\Lambda$CDM extensions and we analyze how the
important parameters in the context of the tension vary accordingly. For our
purposes, we study simple extensions of the standard cosmological model, such
as a phantom DE component (with Equation of State $w < -1$) and extra
relativistic species in the early Universe (so that $N_{eff} > 3.046$). We
obtain relations between variation in the value of $w$ and $N_{eff}$ and
changes in $H_0$, $r_s$ and $\sigma_8$. In this way an empirical relation
between $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ is provided, that is a first step in understanding
which classes of theoretical models, and with which characteristics, could be
able to break the correlation between the two tensions.

animation in immersive VR helps improve the user experience and provides a
Sense of Embodiment. However, consumer-grade VR devices typically include at
most three trackers, one at the Head Mounted Display (HMD), and two at the
handheld VR controllers. Since the problem of reconstruction the user pose from
such sparse data is ill-defined, especially for the lower body, the approach
adopted by most VR games consists of assuming the body orientation matches that
of the HMD, and applying animation blending and time-warping from a reduced set
of animations. Unfortunately, this approach produces noticeable mismatches
between user and avatar movements. In this work we present a new approach to
animate user avatars that is suitable for current mainstream VR devices. First,
we use a neural network to estimate the user's body orientation based on the
tracking information from the HMD and the hand controllers. Then we use this
orientation together with the velocity and rotation of the HMD to build a
feature vector that feeds a Motion Matching algorithm. We built a MoCap
database with animations of VR users wearing a HMD and used it to test our
approach on both self-avatars and other users' avatars. Our results show that
our system can provide a large variety of lower body animations while correctly
matching the user orientation, which in turn allows us to represent not only
forward movements but also stepping in any direction.

The full 3D patterns of all antenna elements in the array need to be
characterized because they are in general different due to construction
inaccuracy, coupling, antenna array's asymmetry, etc. The effective aperture
distribution function (EADF) can provide an analytic description of an antenna
array based on a full-sphere measurement of the array in an anechoic chamber.
However, as the array aperture increases, denser spatial samples are needed for
EADF due to large distance offsets of array elements from the reference point
in the anechoic chamber, leading to a prohibitive measurement time and
increased complexity of EADF. In this paper, we present the EADF applied to
large-scale arrays and highlight issues caused by the large array aperture. To
overcome the issues, an enhanced EADF is proposed with a low complexity that is
intrinsically determined by the characteristic of each array element rather

perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) a promising material for nanostructure-based

stability under ambient conditions and inefficient charge carrier injection.
Here, we investigate solutions to both problems, employing methylammonium lead
bromide (MAPbBr_3) NCs encapsulated in diblock copolymer core-shell micelles of
tunable size. We confirm that the shell does not prohibit energy transfer, as
FRET efficiencies between these NCs and 2D CsPbBr_3 nanoplatelets (NPLs) reach
73.6%. This value strongly correlates to the micelle size, with thicker shells
displaying significantly reduced FRET efficiencies. Those high efficiencies
come with a price, as the thinnest shells protect the encapsulated NCs less
from environmentally induced degradation. Finding the sweet spot between
efficiency and protection could lead to the realization of tailored energy
funnels with enhanced carrier densities for high-power perovskite NC-based
optoelectronic applications.

foreground/background classification, bounding box regression and person
re-identification. Therefore, person search is a typical multi-task learning
problem, especially when solved in an end-to-end manner. Recently, some works
enhance person search features by exploiting various auxiliary information,
e.g. person joint keypoints, body part position, attributes, etc., which brings
in more tasks and further complexifies a person search model. The inconsistent
convergence rate of each task could potentially harm the model optimization. A
straightforward solution is to manually assign different weights to different
tasks, compensating for the diverse convergence rates. However, given the
special case of person search, i.e. with a large number of tasks, it is
impractical to weight the tasks manually. To this end, we propose a Grouped
Adaptive Loss Weighting (GALW) method which adjusts the weight of each task
automatically and dynamically. Specifically, we group tasks according to their
convergence rates. Tasks within the same group share the same learnable weight,
which is dynamically assigned by considering the loss uncertainty. Experimental
results on two typical benchmarks, CUHK-SYSU and PRW, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

Encouraged by the promising results we have obtained in the recent past through
the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to estimate slowly-varying model

  Convergence Analysis","Submitted for journal publication",,,,"quant-ph cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer the most promising path to
obtaining quantum advantages via noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
processors. Such systems leverage classical optimization to tune the parameters
of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC). The goal is minimizing a cost
function that depends on measurement outputs obtained from the PQC.
Optimization is typically implemented via stochastic gradient descent (SGD). On
NISQ computers, gate noise due to imperfections and decoherence affects the
stochastic gradient estimates by introducing a bias. Quantum error mitigation
(QEM) techniques can reduce the estimation bias without requiring any increase
in the number of qubits, but they in turn cause an increase in the variance of
the gradient estimates. This work studies the impact of quantum gate noise on
the convergence of SGD for the variational eigensolver (VQE), a fundamental
instance of VQAs. The main goal is ascertaining conditions under which QEM can
enhance the performance of SGD for VQEs. It is shown that quantum gate noise
induces a non-zero error-floor on the convergence error of SGD (evaluated with
respect to a reference noiseless PQC), which depends on the number of noisy
gates, the strength of the noise, as well as the eigenspectrum of the
observable being measured and minimized. In contrast, with QEM, any arbitrarily
small error can be obtained. Furthermore, for error levels attainable with or
without QEM, QEM can reduce the number of required iterations, but only as long
as the quantum noise level is sufficiently small, and a sufficiently large
number of measurements is allowed at each SGD iteration. Numerical examples for
a max-cut problem corroborate the main theoretical findings.

more semantic objectives, such as generating tests to reproduce a given bug

that the number of tests added in open source repositories due to issues was
about 28% of the corresponding project test suite size. Meanwhile, due to the
difficulties of transforming the expected program semantics in bug reports into
test oracles, existing failure reproduction techniques tend to deal exclusively
with program crashes, a small subset of all bug reports. To automate test
generation from general bug reports, we propose LIBRO, a framework that uses
Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been shown to be capable of performing
code-related tasks. Since LLMs themselves cannot execute the target buggy code,
we focus on post-processing steps that help us discern when LLMs are effective,
and rank the produced tests according to their validity. Our evaluation of
LIBRO shows that, on the widely studied Defects4J benchmark, LIBRO can generate
failure reproducing test cases for 33% of all studied cases (251 out of 750),
while suggesting a bug reproducing test in first place for 149 bugs. To
mitigate data contamination, we also evaluate LIBRO against 31 bug reports
submitted after the collection of the LLM training data terminated: LIBRO
produces bug reproducing tests for 32% of the studied bug reports. Overall, our
results show LIBRO has the potential to significantly enhance developer

SARS-CoV-2 is determined by numerous contextual factors, including adherence.
Conventional wisdom holds that the effectiveness of protective behaviour such
as wearing masks always increases with the number of people adopting it. Here
we show in a simulation study that this is not true in general. We employ a
parsimonious network model based on the well-established empirical facts that
(i) adherence to such interventions wanes over time and (ii) individuals tend
to align their adoption strategies with their close social ties (homophily).
When combining these assumptions, a broad dynamical regime emerges where the
individual-level infection risk reduction for those adopting protective
behaviour increases as the adherence to protective behavior decreases. For
instance, for a protective coverage of 10% we find the infection risk for
adopting individuals can be reduced by close to 30% compared to situations
where the coverage is 60%. Using estimates for the effectiveness of surgical
masks, we find that reductions in relative risk of masking versus non-masking
individuals range between 5% and 15%, i.e., vary by a factor of three. This
small coverage effect originates from system-dynamical network properties that
conspire to increase the chance that an outbreak will be over before the
pathogen is able to invade small but tightly connected groups of individuals
that protect themselves. Our results contradict the popular belief that masking
becomes ineffectual as more people drop their masks and might have far-reaching
implications for the protection of vulnerable population groups under resurgent
infection waves.

successful in guaranteeing safety/collision avoidance with static obstacles,
extensions for the dynamic case with torque/acceleration-controlled unicycle
and bicycle models have seen limited success. Moreover, with these nonholonomic
UGV models, applications of existing CBFs have been conservative in terms of
control, i.e., steering/thrust control has not been possible under certain
common scenarios. Drawing inspiration from the classical use of collision cones
for obstacle avoidance in path planning, we introduce its novel CBF formulation
with theoretical guarantees on safety for both the unicycle and bicycle models.
The main idea is to ensure that the velocity of the obstacle w.r.t. the vehicle
is always pointing away from the vehicle. Accordingly, we construct a
constraint that ensures that the velocity vector always avoids a cone of
vectors pointing at the vehicle. The efficacy of this new control methodology
is experimentally verified on the Copernicus mobile robot. We further extend it
to the bicycle model and demonstrate collision avoidance under various
scenarios in the CARLA simulator.

over time. Previously, this has been achieved by comparing their global spatial

improves temporal organ matching. We present a landmark-free shape compression

characterises leaf shape and curvature efficiently in few parameters, and makes
the association of individual leaves in feature space possible. The approach
combines 3D contour extraction and further compression using Principal

Our evaluation on temporal scan sequences of tomato plants shows, that

on a tiny sound dataset. Our case study investigates a variational autoencoder
(VAE) for augmenting a small drill sound dataset from Valmet AB. A Valmet
dataset contains 134 sounds that have been divided into two categories:
""Anomaly"" and ""Normal"" recorded from a drilling machine in Valmet AB, a company
in Sundsvall, Sweden that supplies equipment and processes for the production
of biofuels. Using deep learning models to detect failure drills on such a
small sound dataset is typically unsuccessful. We employed a VAE to increase
the number of sounds in the tiny dataset by synthesizing new sounds from
original sounds. The augmented dataset was created by combining these
synthesized sounds with the original sounds. We used a high-pass filter with a
passband frequency of 1000 Hz and a low-pass filter with a passband frequency
of 22\kern 0.16667em000 Hz to pre-process sounds in the augmented dataset
before transforming them to Mel spectrograms. The pre-trained 2D-CNN Alexnet
was then trained using these Mel spectrograms. When compared to using the
original tiny sound dataset to train pre-trained Alexnet, using the augmented
sound dataset enhanced the CNN model's classification results by 6.62\%(94.12\%
when trained on the augmented dataset versus 87.5\% when trained on the
original dataset).

essential step before publishing large datasets of such for research purposes.
The conventional anonymization process is carried out by obscuring personal
information in the images with black boxes and removing or replacing
meta-information. However, such simple measures retain biometric information in
the chest radiographs, allowing patients to be re-identified by a linkage
attack. Therefore, we see an urgent need to obfuscate the biometric information
appearing in the images. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first
deep learning-based approach to targetedly anonymize chest radiographs while
maintaining data utility for diagnostic and machine learning purposes. Our
model architecture is a composition of three independent neural networks that,
when collectively used, allow for learning a deformation field that is able to
impede patient re-identification. The individual influence of each component is
investigated with an ablation study. Quantitative results on the ChestX-ray14
dataset show a reduction of patient re-identification from 81.8% to 58.6% in
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with little
impact on the abnormality classification performance. This indicates the
ability to preserve underlying abnormality patterns while increasing patient
privacy. Furthermore, we compare the proposed deep learning-based anonymization
approach with differentially private image pixelization, and demonstrate the
superiority of our method towards resolving the privacy-utility trade-off for
chest radiographs.

find nonequilibrium strategies for amplifying transition rates by coupling a
given reaction coordinate to the background shear flow. We also find that shear
flow can be made to selectively break detailed balance and maximize probability
currents by modifying the stability of intermediates. For a microphase
consisting of many nanoclusters, we study the flux of colloids hopping between

black-box models, through the prism of uncertainty quantification (UQ), is

present measurements of self-diffusion coefficients in discrete numerical

Although the segregation is inherent in two dimensions (2D), the solution may

in the semi-dilute regime displays solvent quality-dependent increases with the
area fraction ($\phi$) (or monomer concentration, $\rho$), that is, $\Pi\sim

pressure can be associated with the Flory exponent (or the correlation length
exponent) for the chain size and the pair distribution function of monomers;
however, they do not necessarily offer a detailed microscopic picture leading

penetration of vortices in superconductors. Their motion leads to dissipation
and resistive state arises, which in turn strongly affects the performance of
superconducting devices such as single-photon and single-electron detectors.
Therefore, an understanding of the dissipation mechanisms in mesoscopic
superconductors is not only of fundamental value but also very important for
further technological advances. In the present work, we analyzed the
contributions and interplay of the dissipative mechanisms due to the locally
induced electric field and an intrinsic relaxation of the superconducting order
parameter, $\Psi$, in mesoscopic samples by using the time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau theory. Although often neglected, we show that the dissipated
energy due to relaxation of $\Psi$ must be taken into account for an adequate
description of the total dissipated energy. The local increase of the
temperature due to vortex motion and its diffusion in the sample were also
analyzed, where the joint effect of thermal relaxation and vortex dynamics
plays an important role for the dissipative properties presented by the
superconducting systems.

phase shift at each impurity taking non-universal values. Finally, for an
extended model including charge transfer between the hosts and a small Coulomb

$\Delta$ is the distance between the treatment and control running variable

an ego vehicle will generally require closer inspection than a missed detection
of a car in the distance. The problem of predicting such potential failures at
test time has largely been overlooked in the literature and conventional
approaches based on detection uncertainty fall short in that they are agnostic
to such fine-grained characterisation of errors. In this work, we propose to
reformulate the problem of finding ""hard"" images as a query-based hard image

a simple and intuitive method that can solve this task for a large family of
queries. Our method is entirely post-hoc, does not require ground-truth
annotations, is independent of the choice of a detector, and relies on an
efficient Monte Carlo estimation that uses a simple stochastic model in place
of the ground-truth. We show experimentally that it can be applied successfully
to a wide variety of queries for which it can reliably identify hard images for

Their appearance seems to be a robust feature of the theory. The gaps evolve
naturally into two-solid regions of eutectic phase diagrams at higher
$Z_2/Z_1$. They do not depend on thermodynamic fit extensions beyond their
applicability limits. The gaps are sensitive to binary mixture composition and
physics, being strongly different for C/O and O/Ne mixtures and for the three
variants of corrections to linear-mixing solid-state energies available in the
literature. When matter cools to its miscibility gap temperature, the
exsolution process takes place. It results in a separation of heavier and
lighter solid solutions. This may represent a significant reservoir of
gravitational energy and should be included in future white dwarf (WD) cooling
simulations. Ion quantum effects mostly resulted in moderate modifications,

the purpose of the construction of the required Lagrangian, chiral analogues of

the further step in deriving the dynamical equations of motion for a spin
color-charged particle moving in an external fermionic matter field. These
equations of motion are of fundamental importance, for example, when taking
into account the influence of fermionic background fields induced in a hot
quark-gluon plasma (QGP) by thermal fluctuations on the dynamics of hard
color-charged partons crossing the QGP. In turn, the solution of this problem
will make it possible, at least at the qualitative level, to advance in the
study of the motion in the external fermion matter field of such a complex
physical object as a string.

IllustrisTNG100 simulation. Among 1912 well-resolved disk galaxies selected
from the last simulation output, we identify 377 red objects and describe their
properties and origins using a few representative examples. The simulated red
spirals turn out to be typically very gas-poor, have very low SFRs, are more
metal-rich, and have larger stellar masses than the remaining disks. Only about
13% of red spirals suffered strong mass loss and thus could have resulted from
environmental quenching by ram pressure and tidal stripping of the gas, or
similar processes. The majority of red disks were probably quenched by feedback
from the active galactic nucleus (AGN). This conclusion is supported by the
higher black hole masses and lower accretion rates of red disks, as well as the
larger total AGN feedback energies injected into the surrounding gas in the
kinetic feedback mode implemented in the IllustrisTNG simulations. The
timescales of the gas loss correlate with the black hole growth for the
AGN-quenched galaxies and with the dark-matter loss for the environmentally
quenched ones. The red spirals are more likely to possess bars, and their bars
are stronger than in the remaining disks, which is probably the effect of gas
loss rather than the reason for quenching.

functions play in ordinal analysis and related work from computability theory.
The present paper aims to explain this phenomenon. In order to do so, we
investigate a rich class of order transformations that are known as
$\mathsf{WPO}$-dilators. According to a first main result of this paper,
$\mathsf{WPO}$-dilators induce normal functions when they satisfy a rather
restrictive condition, which we call strong normality. Moreover, the reverse
implication holds as well, for reasonably well behaved $\mathsf{WPO}$-dilators.
Strong normality also allows us to explain another phenomenon: by previous work
of Freund, Rathjen and Weiermann, a uniform Kruskal theorem for
$\mathsf{WPO}$-dilators is as strong as $\Pi^1_1$-comprehension, while the
corresponding result for normal dilators on linear orders is equivalent to the
much weaker principle of $\Pi^1_1$-induction. As our second main result, we
show~that $\Pi^1_1$-induction is equivalent to the uniform Kruskal theorem for
$\mathsf{WPO}$-dilators that are strongly normal.

problem with continuous variables is applying Newton's method to the system of
nonlinear equations obtained by the corresponding first-order necessary
optimality conditions. However, when taking into account the game dynamics, it
is not clear what is the goal of each player when considering that they are
taking their current decision following Newton's iterates. In this paper we
provide an interpretation for Newton's iterate in view of the game dynamics as
follows: instead of minimizing the quadratic approximation of their objective
function parameterized by the other player current decision (as a typical
Jacobi-type strategy), we show that the Newton iterate follows this approach
but with the objective function parameterized by a prediction of the other
player action, considering that they are following the same Newtonian strategy.
This interpretation allows us to present a new Newtonian algorithm where a
backtracking procedure is introduced in order to guarantee that the computed
Newtonian directions, for each player, are descent directions for their
corresponding parameterized functions. Thus, besides favoring global
convergence, our algorithm also favors true minimizers instead of maximizers or
saddle points, differently from the standard Newton method, which does not
consider the minimization structure of the problem in the non-convex case.
Thus, our method is more robust in comparison with other Jacobi-type strategies
or the pure Newtonian approach, which is corroborated by our illustrative
numerical experiments. We also present a proof of the well-definiteness of the
algorithm under some standard assumptions, together with a thorough analysis of
its convergence properties taking into account the game dynamics.

moment retrieval (VMR) aims to localize the target moment from an untrimmed

on numerous manual annotations (i.e., moment boundaries), which are extremely
expensive to acquire in practice. In addition, due to the domain gap between
different datasets, directly applying these pre-trained models to an unseen
domain leads to a significant performance drop. In this paper, we focus on a
novel task: cross-domain VMR, where fully-annotated datasets are available in
one domain (``source domain''), but the domain of interest (``target domain'')
only contains unannotated datasets. As far as we know, we present the first
study on cross-domain VMR. To address this new task, we propose a novel
Multi-Modal Cross-Domain Alignment (MMCDA) network to transfer the annotation
knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. However, due to the
domain discrepancy between the source and target domains and the semantic gap
between videos and queries, directly applying trained models to the target

cross-modal alignment module aims to map both video and query features into a
joint embedding space and to align the feature distributions between different
modalities in the target domain; (iii) a specific alignment module tries to

the transmission of up and down spin electrons is found to be magnetization

by tuning biasing energy and magnetization strength and choosing a material
with suitable Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling (RSOC). This astonishing property of
our system can be utilized in fabricating devices like spin filters. We found
the Fano factor of our system is 0.4 under strong magnetization conditions

postures to identify human beings.
  However, existing methods did not explicitly resolve the large intra-class
variance of human pose due to camera views changing.
  In this paper, we propose to generate multi-view pose sequences for each
single-view pose sample by learning full-rank transformation matrices via
lower-upper generative adversarial network (LUGAN).
  By the prior of camera imaging, we derive that the spatial coordinates
between cross-view poses satisfy a linear transformation of a full-rank matrix,
thereby, this paper employs the adversarial training to learn transformation
matrices from the source pose and target views to obtain the target pose
sequences.
  To this end, we implement a generator composed of graph convolutional (GCN)
layers, fully connected (FC) layers and two-branch convolutional (CNN) layers:
GCN layers and FC layers encode the source pose sequence and target view, then
CNN branches learn a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix,
respectively, finally they are multiplied to formulate the full-rank
transformation matrix.
  For the purpose of adversarial training, we further devise a condition
discriminator that distinguishes whether the pose sequence is true or
generated.
  To enable the high-level correlation learning, we propose a plug-and-play
module, named multi-scale hypergraph convolution (HGC), to replace the spatial
graph convolutional layer in baseline, which could simultaneously model the
joint-level, part-level and body-level correlations.

  Specifically, we implement a two-branch architecture to separately learn the

  To learn the pose feature, we first detect the pedestrian pose in each frame

embeddings, where the self-attention mechanism is employed to learn the
importance of each node and each frame.

superadiabatic forces directly from the microscopic interparticle interactions.
We demonstrate the importance of these nonequilibrium forces for an accurate
description of the one-body density by numerical implementation of our theory
for three-dimensional hard-spheres in a time-dependent planar potential. The
relaxation of the one-body density in superadiabatic-DDFT is found to be slower
than that predicted by standard adiabatic DDFT and significantly improves the
agreement with Brownian dynamics simulation data. We attribute this improved
performance to the correct treatment of structural relaxation within the
superadiabatic-DDFT. Our approach provides fundamental insight into the
underlying structure of dynamical density functional theories and makes
possible the study of situations for which standard approaches fail.

small fraction of it might be involved in transitioning the state and
generating observations. We exploit this fact to calculate an
information-theoretic expected reward, mutual information (MI), over a much
lower-dimensional subset of the state, to improve efficiency and without
sacrificing accuracy. A similar approach was used in previous works, yet
specifically for Gaussian distributions, and we here extend it for general

which the new states are augmented to the previous, yet again without

studied but remains undecided. To isolate the contribution of coherence, we
analyze the performance of a purely coherence-driven quantum heat engine, a
device that does not include any heat flow during the thermodynamic cycle. The
engine is powered by the coherence of a multiqubit system, where each qubit is
charged via interaction with a coherence bath using the Jaynes-Cummings model.
We demonstrate that optimal coherence charging and hence extractable work is
achieved when the coherence bath has an intermediate degree of coherence. In
our model, the extractable work is maximized when four copies of the charged
qubits are used. Meanwhile, the efficiency of the engine, given by the
extractable work per input coherence flow, is optimized by avoiding the
coherence being stored in the system-bath correlations that is inaccessible to
work. We numerically find that the highest efficiency is obtained for slightly
lower temperatures and weaker system-bath coupling than those for optimal
coherence charging.

across multiple devices is an increasingly important problem. The problem is
often formulated in the federated learning context, with the aim of learning a
single global model while keeping the data distributed. Moreover, Bayesian
learning is a popular approach for modelling, since it naturally supports
reliable uncertainty estimates. However, Bayesian learning is generally
intractable even with centralised non-private data and so approximation
techniques such as variational inference are a necessity. Variational inference
has recently been extended to the non-private federated learning setting via
the partitioned variational inference algorithm. For privacy protection, the
current gold standard is called differential privacy. Differential privacy
guarantees privacy in a strong, mathematically clearly defined sense.
  In this paper, we present differentially private partitioned variational
inference, the first general framework for learning a variational approximation
to a Bayesian posterior distribution in the federated learning setting while
minimising the number of communication rounds and providing differential
privacy guarantees for data subjects.
  We propose three alternative implementations in the general framework, one
based on perturbing local optimisation runs done by individual parties, and two
based on perturbing updates to the global model (one using a version of
federated averaging, the second one adding virtual parties to the protocol),
and compare their properties both theoretically and empirically.

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Training a robust policy is critical for policy deployment in real-world
systems or dealing with unknown dynamics mismatch in different dynamic systems.
Domain Randomization~(DR) is a simple and elegant approach that trains a
conservative policy to counter different dynamic systems without expert
knowledge about the target system parameters. However, existing works reveal
that the policy trained through DR tends to be over-conservative and performs
poorly in target domains. Our key insight is that dynamic systems with
different parameters provide different levels of difficulty for the policy, and
the difficulty of behaving well in a system is constantly changing due to the
evolution of the policy. If we can actively sample the systems with proper
difficulty for the policy on the fly, it will stabilize the training process
and prevent the policy from becoming over-conservative or over-optimistic. To
operationalize this idea, we introduce Active Dynamics Preference~(ADP), which
quantifies the informativeness and density of sampled system parameters. ADP
actively selects system parameters with high informativeness and low density.
We validate our approach in four robotic locomotion tasks with various
discrepancies between the training and testing environments. Extensive results
demonstrate that our approach has superior robustness for system inconsistency
compared to several baselines.

to split a deep neural network to host its early part on an embedded device and

Under this paradigm, the efficacy of the split in terms of accuracy can be
evaluated only after having performed the split and retrained the entire
pipeline, making an exhaustive evaluation of all the plausible splitting points
prohibitive in terms of time. Here we show that not only the architecture of
the layers does matter, but the importance of the neurons contained therein

will explore the Universe at high redshift, and particularly during the Epoch

their radiations have reionised the previously cold and neutral gas of the
Universe creating ionised bubbles that percolate at the end of the EoR (at a
redshift of approximately 6). SKA will produce 2D images of the distribution of
the neutral gas at many redshifts, pushing us to develop tools and simulations
to understand its properties. This paper aims at measuring topological
statistics of the EoR in the ""reionisation times"" fields from both cosmological
and semi-analytical simulations. This field informs us about the time of
reionisation of the gas at each position, is used to probe the inhomogeneities
of reionisation histories and can possibly be extracted from 21 cm maps. We
also compare these measurements with analytical predictions from the gaussian
random field (GRF) theory. The GRF theory allows us to compute many statistics
of a field: PDFs of the field or its gradient, isocontour length, critical
point distributions, and skeleton length. We compare these theoretical
predictions to measurements made on reionisation time fields extracted from an
EMMA and a 21cmFAST simulations at 1 a cMpc/h resolution. We also compared our
results to GRFs generated from the fitted power spectra of the simulation maps.
Both EMMA and 21cmFAST reionisation time fields (treion(r)) are close to be
gaussian fields, in contrast with the 21 cm, density or ionisation fraction
that are all proven to be non-gaussian. Only accelerating ionisation fronts at
the end of the EoR seem to be a cause of small non-gaussianities in treion(r).
Overall our results indicate that an analytical description of the reionisation
percolation can be reasonably made within the framework of GRF theory.

pre-trained question-answer (QA) construction model to generate pseudo QA pairs
for MRC transfer. Such a process will inevitably introduce mismatched pairs
(i.e., noisy correspondence) due to i) the unavailable QA pairs in target
documents, and ii) the domain shift during applying the QA construction model
to the target domain. Undoubtedly, the noisy correspondence will degenerate the
performance of MRC, which however is neglected by existing works. To solve such
an untouched problem, we propose to construct QA pairs by additionally using
the dialogue related to the documents, as well as a new domain adaptation
method for MRC. Specifically, we propose Robust Domain Adaptation for Machine
Reading Comprehension (RMRC) method which consists of an answer extractor (AE),
a question selector (QS), and an MRC model. Specifically, RMRC filters out the
irrelevant answers by estimating the correlation to the document via the AE,
and extracts the questions by fusing the candidate questions in multiple rounds
of dialogue chats via the QS. With the extracted QA pairs, MRC is fine-tuned
and provides the feedback to optimize the QS through a novel reinforced
self-training method. Thanks to the optimization of the QS, our method will
greatly alleviate the noisy correspondence problem caused by the domain shift.
To the best of our knowledge, this could be the first study to reveal the
influence of noisy correspondence in domain adaptation MRC models and show a
feasible way to achieve robustness to mismatched pairs. Extensive experiments
on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

the recent success of supervised learning. Many practitioners in industries
have been trying to switch from their old paradigms to machine learning.
Interestingly, those data scientists spend more time scrapping, annotating and
cleaning data than fine-tuning models. This thesis is motivated by the
following question: can we derive a more generic framework than the one of
supervised learning in order to learn from clutter data?
  This question is approached through the lens of weakly supervised learning,
assuming that the bottleneck of data collection lies in annotation. We model
weak supervision as giving, rather than a unique target, a set of target
candidates. We argue that one should look for an ``optimistic'' function that
matches most of the observations. This allows us to derive a principle to
disambiguate partial labels. We also discuss the advantage to incorporate
unsupervised learning techniques into our framework, in particular manifold
regularization approached through diffusion techniques, for which we derived a
new algorithm that scales better with input dimension then the baseline method.
  Finally, we switch from passive to active weakly supervised learning,
introducing the ``active labeling'' framework, in which a practitioner can
query weak information about chosen data. Among others, we leverage the fact
that one does not need full information to access stochastic gradients and
perform stochastic gradient descent.

from nonlinear measurements. We formulate the maximum a-posteriori probability
(MAP) estimator, which results in a nonconvex optimization problem.
Conventional iterative methods for minimizing nonconvex problems are sensitive
to the initialization, have high computational complexity, and do not utilize
the underlying graph structure behind the data. In this paper we propose two
new estimators that are both based on the Gauss-Newton method: 1) the
elementwise graph-frequency-domain MAP (eGFD-MAP) estimator; and 2) the graph
signal processing MAP (GSP-MAP) estimator. At each iteration, these estimators
are updated by the outputs of two graph filters, with the previous state
estimator and the residual as the input graph signals. The eGFD-MAP estimator
is an ad-hoc method that minimizes the MAP objective function in the graph
frequency domain and neglects mixed-derivatives of different graph frequencies
in the Jacobian matrix as well as off-diagonal elements in the covariance
matrices. Consequently, it updates the elements of the graph signal
independently, which reduces the computational complexity compared to the
conventional MAP estimator. The GSP-MAP estimator is based on optimizing the
graph filters at each iteration of the Gauss-Newton algorithm. We state
conditions under which the eGFD-MAP and GSP- MAP estimators coincide with the
MAP estimator, in the case of an observation model with orthogonal graph
frequencies. We evaluate the performance of the estimators for nonlinear graph
signal recovery tasks with synthetic data and with the real-world problem of
state estimation in power systems. These simulations show the advantages of the
proposed estimators in terms of computational complexity, mean-squared-error,
and robustness to the initialization of the iterative algorithms.

the delocalization stemming from the interaction-induced hopping overcomes the
localization induced by inter-site interactions. As a result, in stark contrast
to the more studied case of hard-core bosons, delocalization is
counter-intuitively strengthen when the dipolar strength increases.
Furthermore, the quasi-cancellation between bare and interaction-induced

take advantage of particular properties of the prime factors can have a
practical impact on present implementations of cryptographic algorithms that
rely on the complexity of factorization. Currently used keys are chosen on the
basis of the present algorithmic knowledge and, thus, can potentially be
subject to future breaches. For this reason, it is worth to investigate new
approaches which have the potentiality of giving a computational advantage. The
problem has also relevance in quantum computation, as an efficient quantum
algorithm for prime factorization already exists. Thus, better classical
asymptotic complexity can provide a better understanding of the advantages
offered by quantum computers. In this paper, we reduce the factorization
problem to the search of points of parametrizable varieties, in particular
curves, over finite fields. The varieties are required to have an arbitrarily
large number of intersection points with some hypersurface over the base field.
For a subexponential or poly- nomial factoring complexity, the number of
parameters have to scale sublinearly in the space dimension n and the
complexity of computing a point given the parameters has to be subexponential
or polynomial, respectively. We outline a procedure for building these
varieties, which is illustrated with two constructions. In one case, we show
that there are varieties whose points can be evaluated efficiently given a
number of parameters not greater than n/2. In the other case, the bound is
dropped to n/3. Incidentally, the first construction resembles a kind of
retro-causal model. Retro-causality is considered one possible explanation of
quantum weirdness.

fractional solutions of graph problems for which the analysis can be broken

transform fractional/probabilistic label assignments of the vertices into
integral/deterministic label assignments for the vertices, while approximately
preserving a potential function that is a linear combination of functions, each

to obtain polylogarithmic-time deterministic distributed solutions for
combinatorial graph problems. Our general rounding result enables us to locally
and efficiently derandomize a range of distributed algorithms for local graph
problems, including maximal independent set (MIS), maximum-weight independent
set approximation, and minimum-cost set cover approximation. As a highlight, we
in particular obtain a deterministic $O(\log^2\Delta\cdot\log n)$-round
algorithm for computing an MIS in the LOCAL model and an almost as efficient
$O(\log^2\Delta\cdot\log\log\Delta\cdot\log n)$-round deterministic MIS

diversity of configurations. Although there is now a consensus that these
fields are generated through dynamo processes occurring within the convective
zone, the physical mechanism driving such a variety of field topologies is
still debated. This paper discusses the possible origins of dipole and
multipole-dominated morphologies using three-dimensional numerical simulations
of stratified systems where the magnetic feedback on the fluid motion is
significant. Our main result is that dipolar solutions are found at Rossby
numbers up to 0.4 in strongly stratified simulations, where previous works
suggested that only multipolar fields should exist. We argue that these
simulations are reminiscent of the outlier stars observed at Rossby numbers
larger than 0.1, whose large-scale magnetic field is dominated by their
axisymmetric poloidal component. As suggested in previous Boussinesq
calculations, the relative importance of inertial over Lorentz forces is again
controlling the dipolar to multipolar transition. Alternatively, we find that
the ratio of kinetic to magnetic energies can equally well capture the
transition in the field morphology. We test the ability of this new proxy to
predict the magnetic morphology of a few M-dwarf stars whose internal structure
matches that of our simulations and for which homogeneous magnetic field
characterization is available. Finally, the magnitude of the differential
rotation obtained in our simulations is compared to actual measurements
reported in the literature for M-dwarfs. In our simulations, we find a clear
relationship between anti-solar differential rotation and the emergence of
dipolar fields.

this multicolor quantum well structure and looking at the relative radiative
recombination rates of the different emitted wavelengths, we (i) gain insight
into the distribution of carriers in such a system and (ii) can compare our
findings to trends observed in experiment. Our results indicate that the
distribution of carriers depends significantly on the treatment of the quantum
well microstructure. When including random alloy fluctuations and quantum

previous experimental studies. The results from the widely employed virtual

expected from CMB measurements. This discrepancy has been pointed out as a
possible indication that the cosmological principle is not valid. In this
paper, we explore the possibility of detecting and estimating the cosmic dipole

show that a GW dipole consistent with the amplitude of the dipole in radio
galaxies would be detectable with $>3\sigma$ significance with a few years of
observation ($10^6$ GW detections) and estimated with a $16\%$ precision, while
a GW dipole consistent with the CMB one would require at least $10^7$ GW events

analyses of the lensing amplitude parameter $A_{L}$. To confirm if it satisfies
the value expected by the flat-$\Lambda$CDM concordance model, i.e. $A_{L} =
1$, we investigate the spectrum difference obtained as: the difference of the
measured Planck CMB APS and the Planck best-fit $\Lambda$CDM APS model. To know
if this residual spectrum corresponds to statistical noise or if it has a hiden
signature that can be accounted for with a larger lensing amplitude $A_{L} >
1$, we apply the Ljung-Box statistical test and find, with high statistical
significance, that the spectrum difference is not statistical noise. This
spectrum difference is then analysed in detail using simulated APS, based on
the Planck $\Lambda$CDM best-fit model, where the lensing amplitude is a free
parameter. We explore different binnations of the multipole order \,$\ell$\,
and look for the best-fit lensing amplitude parameter that accounts for the
spectrum difference in a $\chi^2$ procedure. We find that there is an excess of
signal that is well explained by a $\Lambda$CDM APS with a non-null lensing
amplitude parameter $A_{lens}$, with values in the interval $[0.10,0.29]$ at
68\% confidence level. Furthermore, the lensing parameter in the Planck APS

Additionally, we perform statistical tests that confirm the robustness of this
result. Important to say that this excess of lensing amplitude, not accounted

finite-dimensional quantum systems whose dynamics can be effectively described
by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We derive a timescale for the degree of
mixedness for an input state undergoing non-Hermitian dynamics and specialize
these results in the case of a driven-dissipative two-level system. Next, we
derive a timescale for the growth of mixedness for bipartite quantum systems
that depends on the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. In the Hermitian
limit, this result recovers the perturbative expansion for coherence loss in
Hermitian systems, while it provides an entanglement timescale for initial pure
and uncorrelated states. To illustrate these findings, we consider the
many-body transverse-field $XY$ Hamiltonian coupled to an imaginary all-to-all
Ising model. We find that the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian enhances the short-time
dynamics of the linear entropy for the considered input states. Overall, each
timescale depends on minimal ingredients such as the probe state and the
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian of the system, and its evaluation requires low
computational cost. Our results find applications to non-Hermitian quantum

$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum field theory.

light is a critical requirement for the development of quantum optical
technologies. In recent years, experiments have demonstrated that cascaded
spontaneous parametric down-conversion is a promising approach to implement
photon precertification, providing a way to overcome photon transmission losses
for quantum communication, as well as to directly produce entangled
three-photon states and heralded Bell pairs. However, the low efficiency of
this process has so far limited its applicability beyond basic experiments.
Here, we propose a scheme to amplify triplet production rates by using a fast
switch and a delay loop to reuse photons that fail to convert on the first pass
through the cascade's second nonlinear crystal. We construct a theoretical
model to predict amplification rates and verify them in an experimental
implementation. Our proof-of-concept device increases the rate of detected
photon triplets as predicted, demonstrating that the method has the potential
to dramatically improve the usefulness of cascaded down-conversion for
device-independent quantum communication and entangled state generation.

data sets, one referring to the associated production of $\Lambda$'s with a

the inclusive $\Lambda$ production, with the reconstruction of the thrust axis.
We adopt the Collins-Soper-Sterman framework and employ the recent formulation
on the factorization of single-inclusive hadron production. This extends a
previous phenomenological study carried out in a more simplified TMD approach,
leading to a new extraction of the polarizing fragmentation function (FF).
While confirming several features of the previous analysis, here we include the
proper QCD scale dependence of this TMD FF and carefully exploit the role of
its nonperturbative component. The compatibility, within a unique TMD
factorization scheme, of double and single-inclusive hadron production is
discussed in detail. Moreover, we consider another data set for inclusive
$\Lambda$ production, at much larger energies, from the OPAL Collaboration, in
order to test the consistency of the entire approach. Finally, we elaborate on
some fundamental issues like the role of $SU(2)$ isospin symmetry and the heavy

telescope as a module of the Subaru Extreme AO (SCExAO) platform. It achieves
sensitivity and accuracy by a unique combination of sparse aperture masking,
spatial filtering by single-mode fibers and cross-dispersion in the visible
(600-900nm). The ongoing upgrade aims at using a photonic chip beam combiner,
allowing the measurement of the complex visibility for every baseline
independently. Using the integrated optics technology will increase the
stability and sensitivity, and thus improve the dynamic range. Integrated
optics chips working in the visible wavelength range are challenging (in terms
of throughput and polarization). Several photonic chips are under
characterization in our laboratory and we have installed a first prototype chip
in the FIRSTv2 instrument at the Subaru Telescope. I will thus report on the

operation. Indeed, a system to predict the intention of people near the door
also involves a deeper understanding of the social context of the scene through
a complex combined analysis of proxemics and scene reasoning. Furthermore, we

Thus, biochemists rely to a large extent only on quantitative analysis of
geometric and physico-chemical properties. However, the usage of abstract
methods to study inherently spatial data hinders the exploration and poses a
considerable workload. sMolBoxes link quantitative analysis of a user-defined
set of properties with interactive 3D visualizations. They enable visual
explanations of molecular behaviors, which lead to an efficient discovery of
biochemically significant parts of the MD simulation. sMolBoxes follow a
node-based model for flexible definition, combination, and immediate evaluation

between multiple properties, which facilitates hypothesis generation. Each
sMolBox provides quick insight to an observed property or function, available

these limitations by using pixels with embedded histogramming, which lock onto

applications. An informative and concise cost volume representation is vital
for stereo matching of high accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we present
a novel cost volume construction method, named attention concatenation volume
(ACV), which generates attention weights from correlation clues to suppress
redundant information and enhance matching-related information in the
concatenation volume. The ACV can be seamlessly embedded into most stereo
matching networks, the resulting networks can use a more lightweight
aggregation network and meanwhile achieve higher accuracy. We further design a
fast version of ACV to enable real-time performance, named Fast-ACV, which
generates high likelihood disparity hypotheses and the corresponding attention
weights from low-resolution correlation clues to significantly reduce
computational and memory cost and meanwhile maintain a satisfactory accuracy.
The core idea of our Fast-ACV is volume attention propagation (VAP) which can
automatically select accurate correlation values from an upsampled correlation
volume and propagate these accurate values to the surroundings pixels with
ambiguous correlation clues. Furthermore, we design a highly accurate network
ACVNet and a real-time network Fast-ACVNet based on our ACV and Fast-ACV

research and industry. It formally verifies the robustness of transformers
against adversarial attacks such as exchanging words in a sentence with
synonyms. However, the performance of transformer verification is still not
satisfactory due to bound-centric computation which is significantly different
from standard neural networks. In this paper, we propose Faith, an efficient
framework for transformer verification on GPUs. We first propose a
semantic-aware computation graph transformation to identify semantic
information such as bound computation in transformer verification. We exploit
such semantic information to enable efficient kernel fusion at the computation
graph level. Second, we propose a verification-specialized kernel crafter to
efficiently map transformer verification to modern GPUs. This crafter exploits
a set of GPU hardware supports to accelerate verification specialized
operations which are usually memory-intensive. Third, we propose an
expert-guided autotuning to incorporate expert knowledge on GPU backends to
facilitate large search space exploration. Extensive evaluations show that
Faith achieves $2.1\times$ to $3.4\times$ ($2.6\times$ on average) speedup over
state-of-the-art frameworks.

usually experience severe keyhole fading effect especially for multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) channels, which degrades the capacity and outage
performance due to the rank deficiency. To avoid these, the integration of MIMO
and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) is proposed to assist V2V
communications in this paper. By using the methods of integral transforms, the
outage probabilities are derived in closed-form for different HARQ-assisted
schemes, including Type I-HARQ, HARQ with chase combining (HARQ-CC), and HARQ
with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR). With the results, meaningful insights
are gained by conducting the asymptotic outage analysis. Specifically, it is
revealed that full time diversity order can be achieved, while full spatial
diversity order is unreachable as compared to MIMO-HARQ systems without keyhole
effect. Moreover, we prove that the asymptotic outage probability is a
monotonically increasing and convex function of the transmission rate. More
importantly, although HARQ-IR performs better than HARQ-CC owing to its higher
coding complexity, this advantage becomes negligible in the large-scale array
regime. Finally, the numerical results are verified by Monte-Carlo simulations

of multiple independent Gamma random variables based on an infinite series

the outage probability and it is proved that the truncation error decreases
exponentially with the truncation order. Asymptotic outage probability is then
derived in a simple form, with which the impacts of packet transmission rate,
transmit power and channel time correlation could be decoupled and analyzed
clearly. Based on the asymptotic outage probability, diversity order of HARQ is
also analyzed. It is found that full diversity can be achieved even under time
correlated fading channels and the time correlation of the channels has
negative effect on the outage probability under high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR). Finally, our analytical results are validated by MonteCarlo simulations.

impacts of line-of-sight (LOS) path, time correlation between fading channels
and unequal means & variances between the in-phase and the quadrature

significantly complicate the performance analysis. The complex form of the
joint distribution of channel coefficients makes the exact analysis rather
difficult. Hence, the asymptotic analysis of HARQ-IR is conducted to obtain
tractable results. The outage probability and the long term average throughput
(LTAT) are then derived in closed-form with clear insights. Furthermore, the
simplicity of the obtained expressions enables the maximization of the LTAT
given an outage constraint through choosing appropriate transmission rates.
Particularly, the increasing monotonicity and the convexity of outage

suboptimally by combining together alternately iterating optimization and
concave fractional programming, and the proposed suboptimal algorithm has a

approximates the task marginal likelihood and is evaluated under samples drawn
from an auxiliary sampling distribution (cached retriever and/or approximate

large corpora. We demonstrate VOD's versatility by training reader-retriever
BERT-sized models on multiple-choice medical exam questions. On the MedMCQA

processes. This is explained by a favorable Debye-Waller factor specific to the
multiple collision regime of grazing incidence. This paper presents the first
extensive evaluation of the temperature behavior between 177 and 1017 K on a

attenuation of the elastic intensity is observed but the maximum coherence is
hardly limited by the attraction forces. It is more influenced by the surface
stiffness and appears very sensitive to surface defects.

enhancing the solar reflectance in daylight radiative cooling. Here, we
investigate the impact of material dispersion on the scattering performance of
popular nanoparticles for radiative cooling applications. We show that, due to
material dispersion, nanoparticles with a qualitatively similar response at
visible frequencies exhibit fundamentally different scattering properties at
infrared frequencies. It is found that dispersive nanoparticles exhibit
suppressed-scattering windows, allowing for selective thermal emission within
an highly reflective sample. The existence of suppressed-scattering windows
solely depends on material dispersion, and they appear pinned to the same
wavelength even in random composite materials and periodic metasurfaces.
Finally, we investigate calcium-silicate-hydrate (CSH), the main phase of
concrete, as an example of a dispersive host, illustrating that the co-design
of nanoparticles and host allows for tuning of the suppressed-scattering
windows. Our results indicate that controlled nanoporosities would enable
concrete with daylight passive radiative cooling capabilities.

time-varying OAM with a higher-order twist of the wavefront structure, which
can be further realized by reflection phase profiles nonlinear in time through
the metasurface. By developing a two-probe measurement technique, we
dynamically map the OAM field pattern varying in time. The proposed

transmitted and stored using far fewer measurements than done by conventional
means employing Nyquist sampling theorem. Since many naturally occurring
signals are sparse (in some domain), compressed sensing has rapidly seen
popularity in a number of applied physics and engineering applications,
particularly in designing signal and image acquisition strategies, e.g.,
magnetic resonance imaging, quantum state tomography, scanning tunneling
microscopy, analog to digital conversion technologies. Contemporaneously,
causal inference has become an important tool for the analysis and
understanding of processes and their interactions in many disciplines of
science, especially those dealing with complex systems. Direct causal analysis
for compressively sensed data is required to avoid the task of reconstructing
the compressed data. Also, for some sparse signals, such as for sparse temporal
data, it may be difficult to discover causal relations directly using available
data-driven/ model-free causality estimation techniques. In this work, we
provide a mathematical proof that structured compressed sensing matrices,
specifically Circulant and Toeplitz, preserve causal relationships in the
compressed signal domain, as measured by Granger Causality. We then verify this
theorem on a number of bivariate and multivariate coupled sparse signal
simulations which are compressed using these matrices. We also demonstrate a
real world application of network causal connectivity estimation from sparse
neural spike train recordings from rat prefrontal cortex.

for the third wave of Artificial Intelligence. Although recent SNNs trained
with supervised backpropagation show classification accuracy comparable to deep

lower. This paper presents a heterogeneous recurrent spiking neural network
(HRSNN) with unsupervised learning for spatio-temporal classification of video
activity recognition tasks on RGB (KTH, UCF11, UCF101) and event-based datasets
(DVS128 Gesture). The key novelty of the HRSNN is that the recurrent layer in
HRSNN consists of heterogeneous neurons with varying firing/relaxation
dynamics, and they are trained via heterogeneous
spike-time-dependent-plasticity (STDP) with varying learning dynamics for each
synapse. We show that this novel combination of heterogeneity in architecture
and learning method outperforms current homogeneous spiking neural networks. We
further show that HRSNN can achieve similar performance to state-of-the-art
backpropagation trained supervised SNN, but with less computation (fewer
neurons and sparse connection) and less training data.
