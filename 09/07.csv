  publication in Advances in Mathematics",,,,"math.DS math.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Kaleidoscopic groups are a class of permutation groups recently introduced by
Duchesne, Monod, and Wesolek. Starting with a permutation group $\Gamma$, the
kaleidoscopic construction produces another permutation group
$\mathcal{K}(\Gamma)$ which acts on a Wa\.{z}ewski dendrite (a densely
branching tree-like compact space). In this paper, we study how the topological
dynamics of $\mathcal{K}(\Gamma)$ can be expressed in terms of the one of
$\Gamma$, when the group $\Gamma$ is transitive. By proving a Ramsey theorem
for decorated rooted trees, we show that the universal minimal flow (UMF) of
$\mathcal{K}(\Gamma)$ is metrizable iff $\Gamma$ is oligomorphic and the UMF of
$\Gamma$ is metrizable. More generally, we give concrete calculations, in an
appropriate model-theoretic framework, of the UMF of $\mathcal{K}(\Gamma)$ when
the UMF of a point stabilizer $\Gamma_c$ has a comeager orbit. Our results also
give a large class of examples of non-metrizable UMFs with a comeager orbit.
These results extend previous work of Kwiatkowska and Duchesne about the full
homeomorphism groups.

  segmentation and patch-level correction","8 pages; IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and
  Applications",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Site preparation by mounding is a commonly used silvicultural treatment that
improves tree growth conditions by mechanically creating planting microsites
called mounds. Following site preparation, the next critical step is to count
the number of mounds, which provides forest managers with a precise estimate of
the number of seedlings required for a given plantation block. Counting the
number of mounds is generally conducted through manual field surveys by
forestry workers, which is costly and prone to errors, especially for large
areas. To address this issue, we present a novel framework exploiting advances
in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imaging and computer vision to accurately
estimate the number of mounds on a planting block. The proposed framework
comprises two main components. First, we exploit a visual recognition method
based on a deep learning algorithm for multiple object detection by pixel-based
segmentation. This enables a preliminary count of visible mounds, as well as
other frequently seen objects (e.g. trees, debris, accumulation of water), to
be used to characterize the planting block. Second, since visual recognition
could limited by several perturbation factors (e.g. mound erosion, occlusion),
we employ a machine learning estimation function that predicts the final number
of mounds based on the local block properties extracted in the first stage. We
evaluate the proposed framework on a new UAV dataset representing numerous
planting blocks with varying features. The proposed method outperformed manual
counting methods in terms of relative counting precision, indicating that it
has the potential to be advantageous and efficient in difficult situations.

Homogeneous Clustering (RHC) to achieve better accuracy and training time. The
intuition behind GHCIDR involves selecting data points by cluster weights and

three deep learning models- Fully Connected Networks (FCN), VGG1, and VGG16. We

contemporary super-resolution (SR) methods aim to recover the underlying

sought. To address this, we reframe the SR problem statement in terms of
perfect reconstruction filter banks, enabling us to identify and directly
estimate the missing information. In this work, we propose a two-stage approach
to approximate the completion of a perfect reconstruction filter bank
corresponding to the anisotropic acquisition of a particular scan. In stage 1,
we estimate the missing filters using gradient descent and in stage 2, we use
deep networks to learn the mapping from coarse coefficients to detail

approach, SR performance is improved particularly in ""slice gap"" scenarios,
likely due to the constrained solution space imposed by the framework.

atmospheres of small, icy bodies. Close to the surface, comets possess a
thermalized atmosphere that traces the irregular shape of the nucleus. Gravity
is too low to retain the gas, which flows out to form a large, collisionless
exosphere (coma) that interacts with the heliospheric radiation environment. As
such, cometary comae represent conditions that are familiar in the context of
planetary atmosphere studies. However, the outer comae are tenuous, with
densities lower than those found in vacuum chambers on Earth. Comets,
therefore, provide us with unique natural laboratories that can be understood
using state-of-the-art theoretical treatments of the relevant microphysical
processes. Radiative processes offer direct diagnostics of the local physical
conditions, as well as the macroscopic coma properties.These can be used to
improve our understanding of comets and other astrophysical environments such

the problem as a potential game and to use an algorithm such as log-linear
learning to achieve the stochastic stability of globally optimal

i.e., only one agent updates its action at each round of the learning process.
To enable faster learning, we propose a synchronization strategy based on
decentralized random prioritization of agents, which allows multiple agents to
change their actions simultaneously when they do not affect each other's
utility or feasible actions. We show that the proposed approach can be
integrated into any standard asynchronous learning algorithm to improve the
convergence speed while maintaining the limiting behavior (e.g., stochastically

the reliability of such models requires the local subdomains to cover the whole

multi-instance multi-label learning (MIML) problems and have been extensively
studied during the past few years. Existing MIML methods are useful in many
applications but most of which suffer from relatively low accuracy and training
efficiency due to several issues: i) the inter-label correlations (i.e., the
probabilistic correlations between the multiple labels corresponding to an
object) are neglected; ii) the inter-instance correlations cannot be learned
directly (or jointly) with other types of correlations due to the missing
instance labels; iii) diverse inter-correlations (e.g., inter-label
correlations, inter-instance correlations) can only be learned in multiple
stages. To resolve these issues, a new single-stage framework called broad
multi-instance multi-label learning (BMIML) is proposed. In BMIML, there are
three innovative modules: i) an auto-weighted label enhancement learning
(AWLEL) based on broad learning system (BLS); ii) A specific MIML neural
network called scalable multi-instance probabilistic regression (SMIPR); iii)
Finally, an interactive decision optimization (IDO). As a result, BMIML can
achieve simultaneous learning of diverse inter-correlations between whole
images, instances, and labels in single stage for higher classification
accuracy and much faster training time. Experiments show that BMIML is highly
competitive to (or even better than) existing methods in accuracy and much

within different television watching journeys, and how long it takes between
events. The model drastically reduces the dimensionality of the data from
thousands of observations per customer to 11 customer-level parameter estimates
and random effects. We test our methodology using data from 40 BT customers (20
active and 20 who eventually cancelled their subscription) whose TV watching
behaviours were recorded from October to December 2019, totalling approximately
half a million observations. Employing different machine learning techniques
using the parameter estimates and random effects from the Bayesian hierarchical
model as features yielded up to 92\% accuracy predicting churn, associated with
100\% true positive rates and false positive rates as low as 14\% on a

wall velocity, which makes it possible to have a real-time probing of the
domain movement in the area illuminated by a laser spot. We have compared this
method to the most usual one: although the velocities are similar, the
different method do not give the same results if the laser spot is too small.
It can be explained by a dendritic shape of the domain wall. By changing the

in the laser spot as a function of its size and makes it possible to extract
the velocity and the depth of the dendrites.

as randomness takes part in the evolution of the data. The problem becomes
exceedingly complex when the trajectories of the stochastic data are absent in
many scenarios. Here we present an approach to effectively modeling the
dynamics of the stochastic data without trajectories based on the weak form of
the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation, which governs the evolution of the density
function in the Brownian process. Taking the collocations of Gaussian functions
as the test functions in the weak form of the FP equation, we transfer the
derivatives to the Gaussian functions and thus approximate the weak form by the
expectational sum of the data. With a dictionary representation of the unknown
terms, a linear system is built and then solved by the regression, revealing
the unknown dynamics of the data. Hence, we name the method with the Weak
Collocation Regression (WCR) method for its three key components: weak form,
collocation of Gaussian kernels, and regression. The numerical experiments show
that our method is flexible and fast, which reveals the dynamics within seconds
in multi-dimensional problems and can be easily extended to high-dimensional
data such as 20 dimensions. WCR can also correctly identify the hidden dynamics
of the complex tasks with variable-dependent diffusion and coupled drift, and
the performance is robust, achieving high accuracy in the case with noise
added.

conditional entropy (CE) and mutual information ($I[Re; Co] $) as two key
Information Theoretical measurements. Through the process of evaluating these
two entropy-based measurements and resolving statistical tasks, we acquire
several computational guidelines for carrying out the major factor selection
protocol in a do-and-learn fashion. Specifically, practical guidelines are
established for evaluating CE and $I[Re; Co] $ in accord with the criterion
called [C1:confirmable]. Via [C1:confirmable] criterion, we make no attempts on
acquiring consistent estimations of these theoretical information measurements.
All evaluations are carried out on a contingency table platform, upon which the
practical guidelines also provide ways of lessening effects of curse of

to the solution of the quasi-geostrophic (QG) equations in an asymptotic regime
where the intensities of rotation and stratification increase to infinity while
the rotation-stratification ratio tends to any positive number other than one.
Despite the non-uniformity of the generic convergence rates near the region
where the ratio is one, we further show that such quasi-geostrophic
approximation continues to be valid even when the ratio goes to one as long as
both intensities increase to infinity fast enough. In contrast, we prove
non-convergence when such intensities grow sufficiently slow to infinity with
the ratio tending to one. Our proof of the non-convergence result contains the
first mathematical proof of the Devil's staircase paradox that was originally
cast in Theoret. Comput. Fluid Dynamics 9, 223-251 (1997). Combining both
results for convergence and non-convergence, we give a lower bound for the

non-convergence actually takes place for any fixed positive
rotation-stratification ratio with respect to the $H^s$ norm with any integer

block for many static analysis tools. Unfortunately, current approaches to
compute value-flows do not scale to large codebases, due to high memory and
runtime requirements. This paper proposes a new scalable approach to compute
value-flows via graph reachability. To this end, we develop a new graph
structure as an extension of LLVM IR that contains two additional operations
which significantly simplify the modeling of pointer aliasing. Further, by
processing nodes in the opposite direction of SSA def-use chains, we are able
to minimize the tree width of the resulting graph. This allows us to employ
efficient tree traversal algorithms in order to resolve graph reachability.
  We present a value-flow analysis framework,DFI, implementing our approach. We
compare DFI against two state-of-the-art value-flow analysis frameworks, Phasar
and SVF, to extract value-flows from 4 real-world software projects. Given 32GB
of memory, Phasar and SVF are unable to complete analysis of larger projects
such as OpenSSL or FFmpeg, while DFI is able to complete all evaluations. For
the subset of benchmarks that Phasar and SVF do handle, DFI requires
significantly less memory (1.5% of Phasar's, 6.4% of SVF's memory footprint on
average) and runs significantly faster (23x speedup over Phasar, 57x compared
to SVF). Our analysis shows that, in contrast to previous approaches, DFI's
memory and runtime requirements scale almost linearly with the number of
analyzed instructions.

on a sapphire substrate using a Ru seed layer. Using spin pumping induced
inverse spin Hall effect measurements on $c$-plane epitaxial
Mn$_3$Sn/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, we measure spin-diffusion length ($\lambda_{\rm
Mn_3Sn}$), and spin Hall conductivity ($\sigma_{\rm{SH}}$) of Mn$_3$Sn thin
films: $\lambda_{\rm Mn_3Sn}=0.42\pm 0.04$ nm and $\sigma_{\rm{SH}}=-702~\hbar/

earlier studies, $\sigma_{\rm{SH}}$ is an order of magnitude higher and of the
opposite sign. The behavior is explained on the basis of excess Mn, which
shifts the Fermi level in our films, leading to the observed behavior. Our
findings demonstrate a technique for engineering $\sigma_{\rm{SH}}$ of Mn$_3$Sn

(COMs) is largely facilitated by surface reactions. However, in cold dark
clouds, thermal desorption of COMs is inefficient because of the lack of
thermal energy to overcome binding energies to the grain surface. Non-thermal
desorption methods are therefore important explanations for the gas-phase
detection of many COMs that are primarily formed on grains. Here we present a
new non-thermal desorption process: cosmic ray sputtering of grain ice surfaces
based on water, carbon dioxide, and a simple mixed ice. Our model applies
estimated rates of sputtering to the 3-phase rate equation model Nautilus-1.1,
where this inclusion results in enhanced gas phase abundances for molecules
produced by grain reactions such as methanol (CH$_{3}$OH) and methyl formate
(HCOOCH$_{3}$). Notably, species with efficient gas phase destruction pathways
exhibit less of an increase in models with sputtering compared to other
molecules. These model results suggest that sputtering is an efficient,
non-specific method of non-thermal desorption that should be considered as an
important factor in future chemical models.

difficult to observe, in particular, from black-box systems. To learn
meaningful models from positive examples only, we design algorithms that rely
on conciseness and language minimality of models as regularizers. To this end,
our algorithms adopt two approaches: a symbolic and a counterexample-guided
one. While the symbolic approach exploits an efficient encoding of language
minimality as a constraint satisfaction problem, the counterexample-guided one
relies on generating suitable negative examples to prune the search. Both the
approaches provide us with effective algorithms with theoretical guarantees on
the learned models. To assess the effectiveness of our algorithms, we evaluate
all of them on synthetic data.

of risk aversion with respect to uncertain prices can be measured through the
context of the indirect utility function (IUF) using a lab experiment. First,
the paper introduces the main elements of the duality theory (DT) in economics.
Next, it proposes the context of IUFs as a suitable framework for measuring
price risk aversion through varying prices as opposed to varying payoffs, which
has been common practice in the mainstream of experimental economics. Indeed,
the DT in modern microeconomics indicates that the direct utility function
(DUF) and the IUF are dual to each other, implicitly suggesting that the degree
of risk aversion (or risk seeking) that a given rational subject exhibits in
the context of the DUF must be equivalent to the degree of risk aversion (or
risk seeking) elicited through the context of the IUF. This paper tests the
accuracy of this theoretical prediction through a lab experiment using a series
of relevant statistical tests. This study uses the multiple price list (MPL)
method, which has been one of the most popular sets of elicitation procedures
in experimental economics to study risk preferences in the experimental
laboratory using non-interactive settings. The key findings of this study
indicate that price risk aversion (PrRA) is statistically significantly greater
than payoff risk aversion (PaRA). Additionally, it is shown that the risk
preferences elicited under the expected utility theory (EUT) are somewhat
subject to context. Other findings imply that the risk premium (RP), as a
measure of willingness to pay for insuring an uncertain situation, is
statistically significantly greater for stochastic prices compared to that for
stochastic payoffs. These results are robust across different MPL designs and
various statistical tests that are utilized.

variety of fields. Given independent random variables, many tools are available
to analyze random matrices whose entries are linear in the variables, e.g. the
matrix-Bernstein inequality. However, in many applications, we need to analyze
random matrices whose entries are polynomials in the variables. These arise
naturally in the analysis of spectral algorithms, e.g., Hopkins et al. [STOC
2016], Moitra-Wein [STOC 2019]; and in lower bounds for semidefinite programs
based on the Sum of Squares hierarchy, e.g. Barak et al. [FOCS 2016], Jones et
al. [FOCS 2021]. In this work, we present a general framework to obtain such
bounds, based on the matrix Efron-Stein inequalities developed by
Paulin-Mackey-Tropp [Annals of Probability 2016]. The Efron-Stein inequality
bounds the norm of a random matrix by the norm of another simpler (but still
random) matrix, which we view as arising by ""differentiating"" the starting
matrix. By recursively differentiating, our framework reduces the main task to
analyzing far simpler matrices. For Rademacher variables, these simpler
matrices are in fact deterministic and hence, analyzing them is far easier. For
general non-Rademacher variables, the task reduces to scalar concentration,
which is much easier. Moreover, in the setting of polynomial matrices, our
results generalize the work of Paulin-Mackey-Tropp. Using our basic framework,
we recover known bounds in the literature for simple ""tensor networks"" and
""dense graph matrices"". Using our general framework, we derive bounds for
""sparse graph matrices"", which were obtained only recently by Jones et al.
[FOCS 2021] using a nontrivial application of the trace power method, and was a
core component in their work. We expect our framework to be helpful for other
applications involving concentration phenomena for nonlinear random matrices.

in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We develop a framework based on linear
response for quantum electrodynamical systems to study how light-matter
coupling affects the optical response. We begin by applying this framework to
find the optical response of a two-level emitter coupled to a single cavity
mode, which could be seen as a ""meta-atom"" of a metamaterial built from
repeated units of this system. We find optical behaviors ranging from that of a
simple two-level system (Lorentz-oscillator) to effectively transparent, as the
coupling goes from the weak to deep strong coupling regimes. We explore a
one-dimensional chain of these meta-atoms, demonstrating the tunability of its
optical behavior. Our scheme may ultimately provide a framework for designing
new metamaterials with low-loss, highly-confined modes, as well as tunable

latter leads to the variation of effective fermion mass during preheating and
makes the resulting spectrum and abundance sensitive to its parameters.
Assuming fast preheating that completes in less than the inflationary Hubble
time and no oscillations of the inflaton field after inflation, we find an
abundant production of particles with energies ranging from the inflationary
Hubble rate to the inverse duration of preheating. The produced fermions can
account for all observed dark matter in a broad range of parameters. As an
application of our analysis, we study non-perturbative production of heavy

mitigate the effects of imperfect hardware by optimizing quantum circuits for
objectives such as critical path length. Few approaches consider quantum

We present a procedure for combining the strengths of analytical native
gate-level optimization with numerical optimization. Although we focus on
optimizing Toffoli gates on the IBMQ native gate set, the methods presented are
generalizable to any gate and superconducting qubit architecture. Our optimized
Toffoli gate implementation demonstrates an $18\%$ reduction in infidelity
compared with the canonical implementation as benchmarked on IBM Jakarta with
quantum process tomography. Assuming the inclusion of multi-qubit
cross-resonance (MCR) gates in the IBMQ native gate set, we produce Toffoli

probability ratio test (SPRT) has been explored before, we develop an
alternative SMC algorithm based on Bayesian hypothesis testing. In comparison
to PCTL*, verifying HyperPCTL* formulae is complex owing to their simultaneous
interpretation on multiple paths of the DTMC. In addition, extending the
bottom-up model-checking algorithm of the non-probabilistic setting is not
straight forward due to the fact that SMC does not return exact answers to the
satisfiability problems of subformulae, instead, it only returns correct
answers with high-confidence. We propose a recursive algorithm for SMC of
HyperPCTL* based on a modified Bayes' test that factors in the uncertainty in
the recursive satisfiability results. We have implemented our algorithm in a
Python toolbox, HyProVer, and compared our approach with the SPRT based SMC.

performs better both in terms of the verification time and the number of

prominent methods due to their relevance to highly efficient and robust ANN

applied to existing and next-generation GW detector signals. The inclusion of

topological insulators in all of the chiral universality classes. Specifically,
we start with a deformation of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model that breaks
time-reversal symmetry, which is in the AIII class. We then couple this model
to its time-reversal counterpart in order to build models in the classes BDI,
CII, DIII and CI. We find that the $\mathbb{Z}$ topological index (the winding
number) in individual chains is defined only up to a sign. This comes from
noticing that changing the sign of the chiral symmetry operator changes the
sign of the winding number. The freedom to choose the sign of the chiral
symmetry operator on each chain independently allows us to construct two
distinct possible chiral symmetry operators when the chains are weakly coupled
-- in one case, the total winding number is given by the sum of the winding
number of individual chains while in the second case, the difference is taken.
We find that the chiral models that belong to $\mathbb{Z}$ classes, AIII, BDI
and CII are topologically equivalent, so they can be adiabatically deformed
into one another so long as the chiral symmetry is preserved. We study the
properties of the edge states in the constructed models and prove that
topologically protected edge states must all be localised on the same
sublattice (on any given edge). We also discuss the role of particle-hole
symmetry on the protection of edge states and explain how it manages to protect
edge states in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classes, where the integer invariant vanishes and
chiral symmetry alone does not protect the edge states anymore. We discuss
applications of our results to the case of an arbitrary number of coupled
chains, construct possible chiral symmetry operators for the multiple chain

deflection efficiency depends on both the mass-fraction of boulders in the
target and on the boulder size-distribution close to the impact point. Our
results may also have important implications for the structure of small

The proposed method enables airlines to utilize their diagnostics measurements
and operational settings to design a more customized maintenance strategy that
takes engine operations conditions into account. Our numerical experiments on
the proposed approach resulted in significant cost savings without compromising
the safety standards. The experiments also show that maintenance strategies

The probabilistic confidence parameter makes our formulation genuinely

distinctions and similarities of the two major schools of economic thought has
never been an easy task to undertake in the classroom. Although the reason for
such a hardship can be multi-fold, one reason has undoubtedly been students'
lack of a holistic view on how the two mainstream economic schools of thought

(FGSM), also known as FGSM-AT, is a computationally simple method to train
robust networks. However, during its training procedure, an unstable mode of
""catastrophic overfitting"" has been identified in arXiv:2001.03994 [cs.LG],
where the robust accuracy abruptly drops to zero within a single training step.
Existing methods use gradient regularizers or random initialization tricks to
attenuate this issue, whereas they either take high computational cost or lead
to lower robust accuracy. In this work, we provide the first study, which
thoroughly examines a collection of tricks from three perspectives: Data
Initialization, Network Structure, and Optimization, to overcome the
catastrophic overfitting in FGSM-AT.
  Surprisingly, we find that simple tricks, i.e., a) masking partial pixels

activation functions, or c) regularizing the weights of the first convolutional
layer, can effectively tackle the overfitting issue. Extensive results on a

in some cases, their use still remains controversial because their ease of
producing inaccurate results when the hyperparameters are not carefully

cases to test the performance of the architectures achieved with the genetic
algorithms and compare them with the standard process, consisting of a grid
with all possible configurations. First, we carry out a model-independent
reconstruction of the distance modulus using a type Ia supernovae compilation.
Second, the neural networks learn to infer the equation of state for the
quintessence model, and finally with the data from a combined redshift catalog
the neural networks predict the photometric redshift given six photometric
bands (urgizy). We found that the genetic algorithms improve considerably the
generation of the neural network architectures, which can ensure more
confidence in their physical results because of the better performance in the
metrics with respect to the grid method.

the higher-level method. Herein, we extend upon such a multimer embedding

the security loopholes in the detection system and is a promising solution for
secret key sharing. Polarization encoding is the most common QKD encoding
scheme, as it is straightforward to prepare and measure. However, implementing
polarization encoding in MDI QKD imposes extra challenges, as polarization
alignment must be maintained over both mutually unbiased bases and be
maintained for both paths (Alice-Charlie and Bob-Charlie). Polarization
alignment is usually done by interrupting the QKD process (reducing overall key
generation rates) or using additional classical laser sources multiplexed with
quantum channels for polarization alignment. Since low key rates and cost are
the two most pressing challenges preventing wide adoption of QKD systems, using
additional resources or reducing key rates runs contrary to making QKD
commercially viable. Therefore, we propose and implement a novel polarization
compensation scheme in the MDI-QKD system that avoids the aforementioned
drawbacks by recycling part of discarded detection events. Our scheme evaluates
the polarization drift in real-time based on single measurements corresponding
to decoy intensities. Our fully automated experimental demonstration maintains
the average polarization drift below 0.13 rad over 40 km of spooled fibre

error rate is 3.8$\%$, and we achieved an average key rate of $7.45\times

the sign of the net neutrino momentum can be opposite to the sign of the
corresponding matter recoil. As a result, at times the pulsar recoil and ejecta
can be in the same direction. Moreover, our results suggest that the duration
of the dipole in the neutrino emissions can be shorter than the duration of the
radiation of the neutron-star binding energy. This allows a larger dipole
asymmetry to arise, but for a shorter time, resulting in kicks in the observed

accretion of matter can leave the residues of collapse with spin periods
comparable to those inferred for radio pulsars and that there seems to be a
slight anti-correlation between the direction of the induced spin and the net

simultaneously with the cluster. Their discs are perturbed by stellar flybys,
inspiralling and colliding stars. This raises the question if an accretion disc
would at all be able to survive in such a dynamic environment and mase water
lines. We investigated what the predicted maser spectrum of such a disc would
look like using 2D hydrodynamic simulations and compared this to the W1
kilomaser. We derived model maser spectra from the simulations by using a
general maser model for appropriate disc temperatures. All our model discs
survived. The model maser spectra for the most destructive case for the
simulations of M = 1000 Msun are a reasonable match with the W1 kilomaser
spectrum in terms of scaling, flux values and some of the signal trends.
Details in the spectrum suggest that a star of a few 1000 Msun might fit even
better, with 10,000 Msun clearly giving too large velocities. Our
investigations thus support the hypothesis that kilomasers could pinpoint

21-cm absorption, using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT),
in radio-loud AGN whose optical spectra show double-peaked [OIII] emission
lines at z<=0.4 (median z~0.14). Among the eight sources for which we could
obtain clean spectra, we detect HI 21-cm absorption in three sources (detection
rate of 38(+36/-20)%) and find tentative indication of absorption in two other
sources. The detection rate of HI 21-cm absorption is tentatively higher for
the systems that show signatures of interaction or tidal disturbance (>~50%) in
the ground-based optical images than that for the systems that appear single
and undisturbed (~25%). This is consistent with the high incidence of HI 21-cm
absorption observed in z<=0.2 galaxy mergers. Higher spatial resolution
spectroscopy is required to confirm the origin of the HI absorbing gas, i.e.
either gas infalling onto the radio-loud AGN, outflowing gas ejected by the
AGN, or gas in rotation on the galactic-scale or circumnuclear discs.

show that if the decorated domain walls have dimension higher than $(0+1)d$,
then the boundary states of such average SPT will almost certainly be
long-range entangled, with probability approaching $1$ as the system size

manifest as constraints on lattice systems similar to the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis

our problem to ""quantum disorders"" that can admit short-range entanglement on

located in the Galactic plane and because of dust extinction. For these
reasons, molecular masers in radio wavelengths have been used with great
success to trace the Milky Way spiral arms. Recently, Gaia parallaxes have
helped in investigating the spiral structure in the Solar extended
neighborhood. In this paper, we propose to determine the location of the spiral
arms using Cepheids since they are bright, young supergiants with accurate
distances (they are the first ladder of the extragalactic distance scale). They
can be observed at very large distances; therefore, we need to take the
Galactic warp into account. Thanks to updated mid-infrared photometry and to
the most complete catalog of Galactic Cepheids, we derived the parameters of
the warp using a robust regression method. Using a clustering algorithm, we
identified groups of Cepheids after having corrected their Galactocentric
distances from the (small) effects of the warp. We derived new parameters for
the Galactic warp, and we show that the warp cannot be responsible for the
increased dispersion of abundance gradients in the outer disk reported in
previous studies. We show that Cepheids can be used to trace spiral arms, even
at large distances from the Sun. The groups we identify are consistent with
previous studies explicitly deriving the position of spiral arms using young

exhibit both ferroelectricity and correlated electronic phenomena such as
low-density superconductivity and anomalous transport. Characterizing such
properties is tied to understanding the quantum dynamics of inversion symmetry
breaking in the presence of itinerant electrons. Here, we present a
comprehensive analysis of the normal state properties of a metal near a quantum
critical transition to a ferroelectric state, in both two and three dimensions.
Starting from a minimal model of electrons coupled to a \emph{transverse} polar
phonon via a Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction, we compute the dynamical
response of both electrons and phonons. We find that the system can evince both
Fermi and non-Fermi liquid phases, as well as enhanced pairing in both singlet
and triplet channels. Furthermore, we systematically compute corrections to
one-loop theory and find a tendency to quantum order-by-disorder, leading to a
phase diagram that can include second order, first order, and finite-momentum
phase transitions. Finally, we show that the entire phase diagram can be
controlled via application of external strain, either compressive or
volume-preserving. Our results provide a map of the dynamical and
thermodynamical phase space of quantum ferroelectic metals, which can serve in
characterizing existing materials and in seeking applications for quantum

Here, we demonstrate how the critical behavior of this fermionic universality
class can be computed within an $\epsilon$ expansion around the lower critical
space-time dimension of two. This approach is complementary to the previously
studied expansion around the upper critical dimension of four. The crucial
technical novelty near the lower critical dimension is the presence of
different four-fermion interaction channels at the critical point, which we
take into account in a Fierz-complete way. By interpolating between the lower
and upper critical dimensions, we obtain improved estimates for the critical
exponents in 2+1 space-time dimensions. For the situation relevant to
single-layer graphene, we find an unusually small leading-correction-to-scaling
exponent, arising from the competition between different interaction channels.
This suggests that corrections to scaling may need to be taken into account
when comparing analytical estimates with numerical data from finite-size
extrapolations.

Model, another particle within the hidden sector might dominate the energy
density of the early universe temporarily, causing an early matter-dominated
era (EMDE). During an EMDE, matter perturbations grow more rapidly than they
would in a period of radiation domination, which leads to the formation of
microhalos much earlier than they would form in standard cosmological
scenarios. These microhalos boost the dark matter annihilation signal, but this
boost is highly sensitive to the small-scale cut-off in the matter power
spectrum. If the dark matter is sufficiently cold, this cut-off is set by the
relativistic pressure of the particle that dominates the hidden sector. We
determine the evolution of dark matter density perturbations in this scenario,
obtaining the power spectrum at the end of the EMDE. We analyze the suppression
of perturbations due to the relativistic pressure of the dominant hidden sector
particle and express the cut-off scale and peak scale for which the matter
power spectrum is maximized in terms of the properties of this particle. We
also supply transfer functions to relate the matter power spectrum with a
small-scale cut-off resulting from the pressure of the dominant hidden sector
particle to the matter power spectrum that results from a cold hidden sector.
These transfer functions facilitate the quick computation of accurate matter
power spectra in EMDE scenarios with initially hot hidden sectors and allow us
to identify which models significantly enhance the microhalo abundance.

greatly benefit from population-level quantification of shape, or
spatiotemporal statistic shape modeling (SSM). Such a tool enables
characterizing patient organ cycles or disease progression in relation to a
cohort of interest. Constructing shape models requires establishing a
quantitative shape representation (e.g., corresponding landmarks).
Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a data-driven SSM approach that captures
population-level shape variations by optimizing landmark placement. However, it
assumes cross-sectional study designs and hence has limited statistical power
in representing shape changes over time. Existing methods for modeling
spatiotemporal or longitudinal shape changes require predefined shape atlases
and pre-built shape models that are typically constructed cross-sectionally.
This paper proposes a data-driven approach inspired by the PSM method to learn
population-level spatiotemporal shape changes directly from shape data. We
introduce a novel SSM optimization scheme that produces landmarks that are in
correspondence both across the population (inter-subject) and across
time-series (intra-subject). We apply the proposed method to 4D cardiac data
from atrial-fibrillation patients and demonstrate its efficacy in representing
the dynamic change of the left atrium. Furthermore, we show that our method
outperforms an image-based approach for spatiotemporal SSM with respect to a
generative time-series model, the Linear Dynamical System (LDS). LDS fit using
a spatiotemporal shape model optimized via our approach provides better
generalization and specificity, indicating it accurately captures the
underlying time-dependency.

colors, when GCs are old, have been used as a proxy of GC metallicities.
Bimodal GC color distributions (CDs) observed in most early-type galaxies have
been interpreted as bimodal MDs for decades, suggesting the presence of merely
two GC subpopulations within single galaxies. However, the conventional view
has been challenged by a new theory that nonlinear metallicity-to-color
conversion can cause bimodal CDs from unimodal MDs. The unimodal MDs seem
natural given that MDs involved many thousand protogalaxies. The new theory has

that, with a slight offset in color, the overall shapes of observed and modeled

that microscopic linear (difference) coupling among units results in coupled

Fisher-consistency of the proposed method is derived under mild assumptions.
The results of a numerical study show, for finite samples, the benefits of the
robust proposal over the one based on sample principal directions and least

the analysis of a real data set which reveals that when the potential outliers

parenthood status on Labor Force Participation (LFP) decisions using an

individuals and over time in having or not having children as well as being or
not being in the labor force provide the variation needed to assess the
association between individuals' LFP behavior and parenthood. Parenthood could

the causal effect of maternity and paternity on LFP separately, the data is
disaggregated by gender. To this end, the effect of a change in the parenthood

time-invariant characteristics of individuals becoming a parent. The primary
data source used is the National Longitudinal Surveys (NLS). Considering the

degenerate due to an SU(2)$\times$SU(2) quasi-symmetry. We next consider both
the k-independent spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and full quadratic-k terms as the

described by a self-commuting ""stabilizer code"" Hamiltonian with a U(1)
quasi-symmetry that can protect nodal planes. In the second approach, we treat
the SOC-free linear-k term and k-independent SOC term as the zero-order. They
exhibit an SU(2) quasi-symmetry, which can be reduced to U(1) quasi-symmetry by
a choice of quadratic terms. Correspondingly, a two-fold degeneracy for all the

source responds and varies accordingly to any change of the ionising

absorber is driven by the density of the gas rather than the ionising
luminosity. In particular, the presence of a radiation driven, inhomogeneous

systemic proper motions (PMs) of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) fields with two
epochs of observations by utilizing stars observed by Gaia as a foreground
frame of reference. HST PM experiments have typically relied on the use of
distant background galaxies or quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) as stationary
sources against which to measure PMs. Without consistent profiles, background
galaxies are more difficult to centroid, but benefit on-aggregate from their
large numbers. QSOs, though they can be fit with stellar point-spread
functions, are sparse, with most fields containing none. Historically, the use
of stars as references against which to measure PMs would have been difficult
because they have individual PMs of their own. However, Gaia has now provided
positions and PMs for over 1.4 billion stars, which are much more likely to be
well-imaged in the fields around targets versus background sources, have
predictable stellar profiles, and require less observing time per-image for
good signal-to-noise. This technique allows us to utilize the power of Gaia to
measure the PM of targets too faint for Gaia to observe itself. We have
recovered PMs for the Milky Way satellites Sculptor and Draco with comparable
uncertainties over HST-only and Gaia-only measurements, limited primarily by
the current capabilities of the Gaia data. We also show the promise of this
method for satellites of M31 with a new PM measurement for Andromeda VII.

challenging to reason about the correctness of potential synthesis candidates.
This is because changes to global state made by effectful library procedures
affect how they may be composed together, yielding an intractably large search
space that can confound typical enumerative synthesis techniques. If the nature
of these effects are exposed as part of their specification, however, deductive
synthesis approaches can be used to help guide the search for components. In
this paper, we present a new specification-guided synthesis procedure that uses
Hoare-style pre- and post-conditions to express fine-grained effects of
potential library component candidates to drive a bi-directional synthesis
search strategy. The procedure alternates between a forward search process that
seeks to build larger terms given an existing context but which is otherwise
unaware of the actual goal, alongside a backward search mechanism that seeks
terms consistent with the desired goal but which is otherwise unaware of the
context from which these terms must be synthesized. To further improve
efficiency and scalability, we integrate a conflict-driven learning procedure
into the synthesis algorithm that provides a semantic characterization of
previously encountered unsuccessful search paths that is used to prune the
space of possible candidates as synthesis proceeds. We have implemented our
ideas in a tool called Cobalt and demonstrate its effectiveness on a number of

environmental costs of the mobility system. Municipalities are increasingly
facing problems of traffic congestion, road safety, energy dependency and air
pollution, and therefore encouraging a shift towards sustainable mobility

cycling, should be particularly encouraged, especially for local recurrent

approach. Instead of using the traditional frequency and severity metrics we
instead predict the total claims that will be made by a new customer using
historical data of current and past policies. Given multiple features of the
policy (age and gender of drivers, value of car, previous accidents, etc.) one
can potentially try to provide personalized insurance policies based
specifically on these features as follows. We can compute the average claims
made per year of all past and current policies with identical features and then
take an average over these claim rates. Unfortunately there may not be
sufficient samples to obtain a robust average. We can instead try to include
policies that are ""similar"" to obtain sufficient samples for a robust average.
We therefore face a trade-off between personalization (only using closely
similar policies) and robustness (extending the domain far enough to capture
sufficient samples). This is known as the Bias-Variance Trade-off. We model
this problem and determine the optimal trade-off between the two (i.e. the
balance that provides the highest prediction accuracy) and apply it to the

Consequently, local feature attributions in data streams provide high

was leveraged to learn the Laplacian matrix of the manifold. Reconstruction was
posed as a SENSE-based non-local soft weighted temporal regularization scheme.
Our approach was compared against view-sharing, low-rank, finite difference,
extra-dimension-based sparsity reconstruction constraints. Under-sampling
experiments were conducted on five volunteers performing repetitive and
arbitrary speaking tasks at different speaking rates. Quantitative evaluation
in terms of mean square error over moving edges were performed in a
retrospectively under-sampled data. For prospective under-sampling, blinded
image quality evaluation in the categories of alias artifacts, spatial
blurring, and temporal blurring were performed by three voice research experts.
Region of interest analysis at articulator boundaries were performed to assess
articulatory motion. Our scheme provided improved reconstruction over the
others. With prospective under-sampling, a spatial resolution of 2.4mm2/pixel
and a temporal resolution of 17.4 ms/frame for single slice imaging, and 52.2
ms/frame for 3-slice imaging were achieved. We demonstrated implicit motion
binning by analyzing the mechanics of the Laplacian matrix. Our method
demonstrated superior image quality scores in reducing spatial and temporal
blurring. While it exhibited faint alias artifacts similar to temporal
finite-difference, it provided statistically significant improvements over
remaining constraints.

continuity of functions on a more general setting outside $\R$. For this we
have considered a topological space which is a measure space as well. We have
built axioms for making the $\sigma$- algebra and measure compatible with the
topology of the space. These spaces are termed as \textit{topological measure
space} (in short \textit{tms}). $\R^n$ with usual topology, Lebesgue
$\sigma$-algebra and Lebesgue measure is a relevant example of tms. Further, we
have presented a new tms structure on second countable metric spaces with the
development of a new measure. This construction is motivated by
\textbf{Carath\'eodory}'s Theorem. In this new tms framework, we have
accomplished exploring ample collection of absolutely continuous functions not
only on $\R^n(n\geq 2)$ but also on any seperable normed linear space. Also, we
have described several analytical aspects carrying the intrinsic sense of
absolute continuity on tms framing. Besides, the collection of all absolutely
continuous functions on tms forms a vector space over $\K$, the field of real
or complex numbers and with additional boundedness property, they form ring and
algebra over $\K$. Thereafter, we have introduced the concept of
\textit{locally Lipschitcz function} on tms involving the measurement of open
connected sets. A relation between absolute continuity and locally Lipschitz
has been developed. We have proved that absolute continuity and boundedness of
linear functionals are same on separable normed linear spaces with the
association of that new measure. Further, we have extended the co-domain of
absolutely continuous functions upto normed linear spaces which helps us to
characterise absolute continuity of linear maps in terms of boundedness when
the domain is a seperable normed linear space incorporated with that new
measure.

downlink training is preferable over statistical CSI when the length of the

cellular mMIMO, however, either one of the two schemes may be better depending
on whether user fairness or sum spectral efficiency is prioritized.
Furthermore, the CF-mMIMO system generally outperforms cellular mMIMO even

modeling allows us to compare several biologically realistic scenarios to help
us interpret experimental data. In this study, we observe and model the
dynamics of the vimentin intermediate filaments in single glial cells seeded on
circular micropatterns following microtubule disruption by nocodazole
treatment. In these conditions, the vimentin filaments move towards the cell
center and accumulate before eventually reaching a steady-state. In absence of
microtubule-driven transport, the motion of the vimentin network is primarily
driven by actin-related mechanisms. To model these experimental findings, we
hypothesize that vimentin may exist in two states, mobile and immobile, and
switches between the states at unknown (either constant or non-constant) rates.
Mobile vimentin are assumed to advect with either constant or non-constant
velocity. We introduce several biologically realistic scenarios using this set
of assumptions. For each scenario, we use differential evolution to find the
best parameter sets resulting in a solution that most closely matches the
experimental data, then the assumptions are evaluated using the Akaike

and they are better at interpreting visualizations that match their

distinguished distinct factors relevant for visualizations of categorical vs.
continuous information. Studies on categorical information focused on direct
associations (e.g., mangos are associated with yellows) whereas studies on
continuous information focused on relational associations (e.g., darker colors
map to larger quantities; dark-is-more bias). We unite these two areas within a
single framework of assignment inference. Assignment inference is the process
by which people infer mappings between perceptual features and concepts
represented in encoding systems. Observers infer globally optimal assignments
by maximizing the ""merit,"" or ""goodness,"" of each possible assignment. Previous
work on assignment inference focused on visualizations of categorical
information. We extend this approach to visualizations of continuous data by
(a) broadening the notion of merit to include relational associations and (b)
developing a method for combining multiple (sometimes conflicting) sources of
merit to predict people's inferred mappings. We developed and tested our model
on data from experiments in which participants interpreted colormap data
visualizations, representing fictitious data about environmental concepts
(sunshine, shade, wild fire, ocean water, glacial ice). We found both direct

feedback gain to provide smooth and accurate joint control across a wide motion
range. Concurrently, it preserves the minimal complexity of its biological
counterpart and is directly deployable on Intel's neuromorphic processor. Using
the joint controller as a building block and inspired by joint coordination in
human arms, we scaled up this approach to control real-world robot arms. The
trajectories and smooth, bell-shaped velocity profiles of the resulting motions
resembled those of humans, verifying the biological relevance of the
controller. Notably, the method achieved state-of-the-art control performance
while decreasing the motion jerk by 19% to improve motion smoothness.

Loop Current (LC) eddy shedding. These eddies can also modify the circulation
in the eastern Gulf of Mexico (GoM) by attracting water and passive tracers
such as chlorophyll and pollutants to the LC-LCFE front. During the 2010
Deepwater Horizon oil spill, part of the oil was entrained not only in the
LC-LCFE front but also inside an LCFE, where it remained for weeks. This study
assesses the ability of the LCFEs to transport water and passive tracers
without exchange with the exterior (i.e., Lagrangian coherence) using altimetry
and a high-resolution model. The following open questions are answered: (1) How
long can the LCFEs remain Lagrangian coherent at and below the surface? (2)
What is the source of water for the formation of LCFEs? (3) Can the formation
of LCFEs attract shelf water?
  The results show that LCFEs are composed of waters originating from the outer
band of the LC front, the region north of the LC, and the shelf, and
potentially drive cross-shelf exchange of particles, water properties, and
nutrients. At depth (~180 m), most LCFE water comes from the outer band of the
LC front in the form of smaller frontal eddies. Once formed, LCFEs can
transport water and passive tracers in their interior without exchange with the
exterior for weeks: these eddies remained Lagrangian coherent for up to 25 days
in the altimetry dataset and 18 days at the surface and 29 days at depth (~180
m) in the simulation. LCFE can remain Lagrangian coherent up to a depth of ~560
m. Additional analyses confirm that the LCFE involved in the oil spill formed
from water near the oil rig location. Temperature-salinity diagrams show that
LCFEs are composed of GoM water as opposed to LC water. Thus, LCFE formation
modify the surrounding circulation and the transport of oil and other passive
tracers in the eastern GoM.

as the possible progenitors of the most extreme supermassive black holes
observed at redshifts $z>6-7$. In this scenario ('direct collapse'), a SMS
accretes at rates $>0.1$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ until it collapses to a black hole
via the general-relativistic (GR) instability. Rotation plays a crucial role in
the formation of such supermassive black hole seeds. The centrifugal barrier
appears as particularly strong in this extreme case of star formation.
Moreover, rotation impacts sensitively the stability of SMSs against GR, as
well as the subsequent collapse. In particular, it might allow for
gravitational wave emission and ultra-long gamma-ray bursts at black hole
formation, which represents currently the main observational signatures
proposed in the literature for the existence of such objects. Here, I present
the latest models of SMSs accounting for accretion and rotation, and discuss

developed a simulation framework that can emulate the dynamic power traces of

known that it is not able to capture the occurrence of first order transitions

remains widely open. In the present work we have developed a method that
combines Self Consistent Variational Approximation with the Renormalization
Group in order to deal simultaneously with the phonon fluctuations and the
topological defects present in the melting process of two dimensional crystals.
The method was applied with impressive success to the study of the phase
diagram of the Gaussian-core model, capturing not only the reentrant feature of
its 2D solid phase, but also the related critical temperatures as a function of
the density in quantitative detail. The developed method can be directly

particles interacting through any finite pairwise interaction potential.
Additionally, it has the potential to explain the occurrence of first order

correspond to different illumination and reflection directions associated with

conveniently applied on the modal reflection coefficients (scattering matrix

process into different stages: from the generation of impact-induced waves, the

LICIACube; ii) brightness increase of the binary system due to enhancement of
the cross section produced by the dust cloud; iii) generation of a dust trail,
similar to those observed in some Active Asteroids, which can last for several
weeks after impact. Numerical prediction of the detectability of these effects
depends on the amount and size distribution of ejected particles, which are
largely unknown. In case these effects are observable, an inversion method can
be applied to compute the amount of ejected material and its velocity
distribution, and discuss the relevance of the shaking process.

resource for quantum computation. However, existing examples of contextuality
in high-dimensional systems lack the necessary robustness required in
experiments. Here we address this problem by identifying a family of
noncontextuality inequalities whose maximum quantum violation grows with the
dimension of the system. At first glance, this contextuality is the
single-system version of multipartite Bell nonlocality taken to an extreme
form. What is interesting is that the single-system version achieves the same
degree of contextuality but uses a Hilbert space of lower dimension. That is,
contextuality ``concentrates'' as the degree of contextuality per dimension
increases. We show the practicality of this result by presenting an
experimental test of contextuality in a seven-dimensional system. By simulating
sequences of quantum ideal measurements with destructive measurements and
repreparation in an all-optical setup, we report a violation of 68.7 standard
deviations of the simplest case of the noncontextuality inequalities
identified. Our results advance the investigation of high-dimensional
contextuality, its connection to the Clifford algebra, and its role in quantum
computation.

threatened by botnet-type cyber attacks that target a large number of
high-wattage smart electrical appliances owned by end-users. Accurate detection
and localization of such attacks is of critical importance in limiting the
damage. To this end, the paper proposes a novel technique using capsule
networks (CNs) tailored to the power grid security application that uses the
frequency and phase angle data monitored by phasor measurement units (PMUs).
With the benefit of vector output from capsules and dynamic routing agreements
between them, CNs can obtain accurate detection and localization performance.
To demonstrate the efficiency of the suggested technique, we compare the
developed CN with benchmark data-driven methodologies, including
two-dimensional convolutional neural networks (2D-CNN), one-dimensional CNN
(1D-CNN), deep multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), and support vector machines
(SVM). Simulations are performed on IEEE 14-, 39-, and 57-bus systems,
considering various real-world issues such as PMU delays, noisy data, and
missing data points. The results show that CNs significantly outperform other
techniques, thus making them suitable for the aforementioned cyber security
applications.

this paper, we will focus on a particular case study: the field of
paleoanthropology, which seeks to understand the evolution of the human species
based on biological and cultural evidence. As we will show, the easy
availability of ML algorithms and lack of expertise on their proper use among
the anthropological research community has led to foundational misapplications
that have appeared throughout the literature. The resulting unreliable results
not only undermine efforts to legitimately incorporate ML into anthropological
research, but produce potentially faulty understandings about our human
evolutionary and behavioral past.
  The aim of this paper is to provide a brief introduction to some of the ways
in which ML has been applied within paleoanthropology; we also include a survey
of some basic ML algorithms for those who are not fully conversant with the
field, which remains under active development. We discuss a series of missteps,
errors, and violations of correct protocols of ML methods that appear
disconcertingly often within the accumulating body of anthropological
literature. These mistakes include use of outdated algorithms and practices;
inappropriate train/test splits, sample composition, and textual explanations;
as well as an absence of transparency due to the lack of data/code sharing, and
the subsequent limitations imposed on independent replication. We assert that
expanding samples, sharing data and code, re-evaluating approaches to peer
review, and, most importantly, developing interdisciplinary teams that include
experts in ML are all necessary for progress in future research incorporating
ML within anthropology.

discriminate between factual and nonfactual statements in text. In this paper
we take into consideration four state-of-the-art systems for ADE detection on

against samples containing negated and speculated ADEs, showing their fragility
against these phenomena. We then introduce two possible strategies to increase
the robustness of these models, showing that both of them bring significant
increases in performance, lowering the number of spurious entities predicted by
the models by 60% for negation and 80% for speculations.

for task aligned manifold estimation (TAME-GP) extends a probabilistic variant

smoothing of latent trajectories in the form of a Gaussian Process prior. This

This article specifically encompasses the case of quasi-periodic heterogeneity
with finite scale separation: no scale separation limit is required. Dynamical
systems theory frames the homogenization as a slow manifold of the ensemble of
all phase-shifts of the heterogeneity. Depending upon any perceived scale
separation within the quasi-periodic heterogeneity, the homogenization may be
done in either one step, or two sequential steps: the results are equivalent.
The theory not only assures us of the existence and emergence of the
homogenization, it also provides a practical systematic method to construct the
homogenization to any specified order. For a class of heterogeneities, we show
that the macroscale homogenization is potentially valid down to lengths which
are just twice that of the microscale heterogeneity! This methodology provides
a new rigorous and flexible approach to homogenization that potentially also
provides correct initial and boundary conditions, treatment of forcing and

constrained stochastic optimization problems, with the constraints originating
mainly from model assumptions that define a trade-off between complexity and
performance. This trade-off is closely related to over-fitting, generalization
capacity, and robustness to noise and adversarial attacks, and depends on both
the structure and complexity of the model, as well as the properties of the
optimization methods used. We develop an online prototype-based learning
algorithm based on annealing optimization that is formulated as an online
gradient-free stochastic approximation algorithm. The learning model can be
viewed as an interpretable and progressively growing competitive-learning
neural network model to be used for supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement

hyper-parameter tuning requirements, poor local minima prevention, and
robustness with respect to the initial conditions. At the same time, it
provides online control over the performance-complexity trade-off by
progressively increasing the complexity of the learning model as needed,
through an intuitive bifurcation phenomenon. Finally, the use of stochastic
approximation enables the study of the convergence of the learning algorithm

common in the protostellar phase, where the envelope component is still
present, and they can release molecules from the dust to the gas phase,
altering the original chemical composition of the disk. Consequently, the study
of accretion shocks is essential for a better understanding of the physical
processes at disk scales and their chemical output. The purpose of this work is
to assess the characteristics of accretion shocks traced by sulfur-related
species. We present ALMA high angular resolution observations (0.1"") of the
Class I protostar Oph-IRS 44. The continuum emission at 0.87 mm is observed,
together with sulfur-related species such as SO, SO$_{2}$, and $^{34}$SO$_{2}$.
Six lines of SO$_{2}$, two lines of $^{34}$SO$_{2}$, and one line of SO are
detected toward IRS 44. The emission of all the detected lines peaks at ~0.1""
(~14 au) from the continuum peak and we find infalling-rotating motions inside
30 au. However, only redshifted emission is seen between 50 and 30 au. Colder
and more quiescent material is seen toward an offset region located at a
distance of ~400 au from the protostar, and we do not find evidence of a
Keplerian profile in these data. Accretion shocks are the most plausible
explanation for the high temperatures, high densities, and velocities found for
the SO$_{2}$ emission. When material enters the disk--envelope system, it
generates accretion shocks that increase the dust temperature and desorb
SO$_{2}$ molecules from dust grains. High-energy SO$_{2}$ transitions (~200 K)
seem to be the best tracers of accretion shocks that can be followed up by
future higher angular resolution ALMA observations and compared to other
species to assess their importance in releasing molecules from the dust to the
gas phase.

communication performance, especially when the line-of-sight (LOS) path between

channel state information (CSI) is needed, which entails significant pilot
overhead. To reduce this overhead and the need for frequent RIS
reconfiguration, we propose a novel framework for integrated localization and
communication, where RIS configurations are fixed during location coherence
intervals, while BS precoders are optimized every channel coherence interval.
This framework leverages accurate location information obtained with the aid of
several RISs as well as novel RIS optimization and channel estimation methods.
Performance in terms of localization accuracy, channel estimation error, and
achievable rate demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach.

late-type M dwarfs provide unique opportunities for characterising their
atmospheres, as well as searching for biosignature gases. We report here the
discovery and validation of two temperate super-Earths transiting LP 890-9
(TOI-4306, SPECULOOS-2), a relatively low-activity nearby (32 pc) M6V star. The
inner planet, LP 890-9b, was first detected by TESS (and identified as
TOI-4306.01) based on four sectors of data. Intensive photometric monitoring of
the system with the SPECULOOS Southern Observatory then led to the discovery of
a second outer transiting planet, LP 890-9c (also identified as SPECULOOS-2c),
previously undetected by TESS. The orbital period of this second planet was
later confirmed by MuSCAT3 follow-up observations. With a mass of
0.118$\pm$0.002 $M_\odot$, a radius of 0.1556$\pm$0.0086 $R_\odot$, and an
effective temperature of 2850$\pm$75 K, LP 890-9 is the second-coolest star
found to host planets, after TRAPPIST-1. The inner planet has an orbital period
of 2.73 d, a radius of $1.320_{-0.027}^{+0.053}$ $R_\oplus$, and receives an
incident stellar flux of 4.09$\pm$0.12 $S_\oplus$. The outer planet has a
similar size of $1.367_{-0.039}^{+0.055}$ $R_\oplus$ and an orbital period of
8.46 d. With an incident stellar flux of 0.906 $\pm$ 0.026 $S_\oplus$, it is
located within the conservative habitable zone, very close to its inner limit.
Although the masses of the two planets remain to be measured, we estimated
their potential for atmospheric characterisation via transmission spectroscopy
using a mass-radius relationship and found that, after the TRAPPIST-1 planets,
LP 890-9c is the second-most favourable habitable-zone terrestrial planet known
so far. The discovery of this remarkable system offers another rare opportunity
to study temperate terrestrial planets around our smallest and coolest
neighbours.

Letter reports a powerful new method, an application of the correlation
integral which we call correlation dimension mapping (CDM), by which the
irregularity of a CH boundary can be objectively quantified. This method
highlights the most important spatial scales involved in boundary dynamics, and
also allows for easy temporal analysis of the boundary. We apply this method to
an equatorial CH bounded on two sides by helmet streamers and on the third by a
small pseudostreamer, which we observed at maximum cadence for an hour on 2015
June 4. We argue that the relevant spatial scales are in the range of $\sim
5-20$ Mm, and we find that boundary complexity depends measurably upon the
nature of the neighboring closed structure. The boundary along the
pseudostreamer shows signs of highly-localized, intermittent complexity
variability, likely associated with abrupt changes in the magnetic topology,
which would be elegantly explained by interchange reconnection. By contrast,
the helmet streamer boundary supports long-lived high-complexity regions. These
findings support the recent predictions of interchange reconnection occurring
at very small scales in the corona.

framework directly learns from readily available large-scale photo datasets in
an unsupervised manner. To this end, we introduce a standardization module that
provides pseudo sketch-photo pairs during training by converting photos and
sketches to a standardized domain, i.e. the edge map. The reduced domain gap
between sketch and photo also allows us to disentangle them into two
components: holistic scene structures and low-level visual styles such as color
and texture. Taking this advantage, we synthesize a photo-realistic image by
combining the structure of a sketch and the visual style of a reference photo.
Extensive experimental results on perceptual similarity metrics and human
perceptual studies show the proposed method could generate realistic photos
with high fidelity from scene sketches and outperform state-of-the-art photo
synthesis baselines. We also demonstrate that our framework facilitates a
controllable manipulation of photo synthesis by editing strokes of
corresponding sketches, delivering more fine-grained details than previous
approaches that rely on region-level editing.

to the chiral phase transition of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this work
such CFTs are analyzed in $d=4-\varepsilon$ and $d=3$. This includes
perturbative computations in the $\varepsilon$ and large-$n$ expansions as well
as non-perturbative ones with the numerical conformal bootstrap. New
perturbative results are presented and a variety of non-perturbative bootstrap
bounds are obtained in $d=3$. Various features of the bounds obtained for large
values of $n$ disappear for low values of $n$ (keeping $m<n$ fixed), a
phenomenon which is attributed to a transition of the corresponding fixed
points to the non-unitary regime. Numerous bootstrap bounds are found that are
saturated by large-$n$ results, even in the absence of any features in the
bounds. A double scaling limit is also observed, for $m$ and $n$ large with
$m/n$ fixed, both in perturbation theory as well as in the numerical bootstrap.
For the case of two-flavor massless QCD existing bootstrap evidence is
reproduced that the chiral phase transition may be second order, albeit
associated to a universality class unrelated to the one usually discussed in
the $\varepsilon$ expansion. Similar evidence is found for the case of
three-flavor massless QCD, where we observe a pronounced kink.

formulation and exploration of Exchangeable Sequences of Clusters (ESC) models.
Under ESC models, it is the cluster sizes that are exchangeable, rather than
the observations themselves. This property is particularly useful for obtaining
microclustering behavior, whereby cluster sizes grow sublinearly in the number
of observations, as is common in applications such as record linkage, sparse
networks and genomics. Unfortunately, the exchangeable clusters property comes
at the cost of projectivity. As a consequence, in contrast to more traditional
Dirichlet Process or Pitman-Yor process mixture models, samples a priori from
ESC models cannot be easily obtained in a sequential fashion and instead
require the use of rejection or importance sampling. In this work, drawing on
connections between ESC models and discrete renewal theory, we obtain
closed-form expressions for certain ESC models and develop faster methods for
generating samples a priori from these models compared with the existing state
of the art. In the process, we establish analytical expressions for the
distribution of the number of clusters under ESC models, which was unknown

presence of heterogeneous sensors which include both fixed and moving sensors.
Traditional fixed sensors are expensive and cannot be installed throughout the
highway. Moving sensors such as Connected Vehicles (CVs) offer a relatively
cheap alternative to measure traffic states across the network. Moving forward
it is thus important to develop such models that effectively use the data from
CVs. One such model is the nonlinear second-order Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model
which is a realistic traffic model, reliable for TSE and control. A state-space
formulation is presented for the ARZ model considering junctions in the
formulation which is important to model real highways with ramps. Linear
approximation of the state-space model is investigated with respect to two
techniques, first-order Taylor series approximation and Carleman linearization.
A Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) implementation is presented for TSE using a
linearized ARZ model. Various state-estimation techniques used for TSE in the
literature along with the presented approach are compared with regard to
accuracy, computational tractability and parameter tuning with the help of a
case study using the VISSIM traffic simulation software. Several research
questions are posed and addressed with thorough analysis of the results.

adaptively reasons about the complexity of the model based on the task while

often handle computational complexity by shortening prediction horizons or
simplifying models, both of which can result in instability. Inspired by
related approaches in behavioral economics, motion planning, and biomechanics,
our method solves MPC problems with a simple model for dynamics and constraints
over regions of the horizon where such a model is feasible and a complex model
where it is not. The approach leverages an interleaving of planning and
execution to iteratively identify these regions, which can be safely simplified
if they satisfy an exact template/anchor relationship. We show that this method
does not compromise the stability and feasibility properties of the system, and
measure performance in simulation experiments on a quadrupedal robot executing
agile behaviors over terrains of interest. We find that this adaptive method

interpreted by attributing drain noise to a thermal component associated with
the channel resistance and a component due to real-space transfer (RST) of
electrons from the channel to the barrier. Using this noise model, we find that
RST contributes $\lesssim 5$% to the drain noise at cryogenic temperatures when
biased for minimum noise temperature. At 300 K, the contribution increases to
over $\sim 60$% of the total drain noise. This finding suggests that improving

between linear and cubic Rashba spin orbit coupling (RSOC) on in-plane magnetic
moments in the LaO/STO system using the Boltzmann transport theory based on the
relaxation time approximation (RTA) and the more refined Schliemann-Loss (SL)
delta-potential scattering model. In general, both methods yield a linear
(quadratic) relationship between the spin accumulation (spin current) when one
of the three RSOC strengths is varied and the other two fixed. The simultaneous
presence of multiple types of RSOC with distinct angular dependences is a key
ingredient in breaking the k-space symmetry of the Fermi surface, thus ensuring
a finite spin accumulation upon integration over the entire Fermi surface.
While the oft-used RTA method is sufficiently accurate for spin accumulation
calculations, the more refined SL model is required for spin current
calculations because the RTA method neglects the anisotropy of the Fermi
contour arising from the cubic RSOC terms. Based on the refined SL model and
under optimal tuning of the RSOC parameters, the spin charge conversion values
in LaO/STO is predicted to reach a remarkable efficiency of 30.

prime targets in the search for life due to the long lifetimes of the host

terrestrial planets found around M-dwarfs. However, the heightened stellar
activity of M-dwarfs and the often tidally locked planets in these systems have
raised questions about the habitability of these planets. In this letter we
examine another significant challenge that may exist: these systems seem to
lack the architecture necessary to deliver asteroids to the habitable
terrestrial planets, and asteroid impacts may play a crucial role in the origin
of life. The most widely accepted mechanism for producing a stable asteroid
belt and the late stage delivery of asteroids after gas disk dissipation
requires a giant planet exterior to the snow line radius. We show that none of
the observed systems with planets in the habitable zone of their star also
contain a giant planet and therefore are unlikely to have stable asteroid
belts. We consider the locations of observed giant planets relative to the snow
line radius as a function of stellar mass and find that there is a population
of giant planets outside of the snow line radius around M-dwarfs. Therefore,
asteroid belt formation around M-dwarfs is generally possible. However, we find
that multi-planetary system architectures around M-dwarfs can be quite

waves from the low-mass X-ray binary Scorpius X-1 using LIGO detector data from
the third observing run of Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA. This is a
semicoherent search which uses details of the signal model to coherently
combine data separated by less than a specified coherence time, which can be
adjusted to balance sensitivity with computing cost. The search covered a range
of gravitational-wave frequencies from 25Hz to 1600Hz, as well as ranges in
orbital speed, frequency and phase determined from observational constraints.
No significant detection candidates were found, and upper limits were set as a
function of frequency. The most stringent limits, between 100Hz and 200Hz,
correspond to an amplitude h0 of about 1e-25 when marginalized isotropically
over the unknown inclination angle of the neutron star's rotation axis, or less
than 4e-26 assuming the optimal orientation. The sensitivity of this search is
now probing amplitudes predicted by models of torque balance equilibrium. For
the usual conservative model assuming accretion at the surface of the neutron
star, our isotropically-marginalized upper limits are close to the predicted
amplitude from about 70Hz to 100Hz; the limits assuming the neutron star spin
is aligned with the most likely orbital angular momentum are below the
conservative torque balance predictions from 40Hz to 200Hz. Assuming a broader
range of accretion models, our direct limits on gravitational-wave amplitude
delve into the relevant parameter space over a wide range of frequencies, to
500Hz or more.

averaging the episodic returns. In the Monte Carlo UCB (MC-UCB) algorithm, the
action taken in each state is the action that maximizes the Q function plus a
UCB exploration term, which biases the choice of actions to those that have
been chosen less frequently. Although there has been significant work on
establishing regret bounds for MC-UCB, most of that work has been focused on
finite-horizon versions of the problem, for which each episode terminates after
a constant number of steps. For such finite-horizon problems, the optimal
policy depends both on the current state and the time within the episode.
However, for many natural episodic problems, such as games like Go and Chess
and robotic tasks, the episode is of random length and the optimal policy is
stationary. For such environments, it is an open question whether the
Q-function in MC-UCB will converge to the optimal Q function; we conjecture
that, unlike Q-learning, it does not converge for all MDPs. We nevertheless
show that for a large class of MDPs, which includes stochastic MDPs such as
blackjack and deterministic MDPs such as Go, the Q-function in MC-UCB converges
almost surely to the optimal Q function. An immediate corollary of this result
is that it also converges almost surely for all finite-horizon MDPs. We also
provide numerical experiments, providing further insights into MC-UCB.

  Maps","Accepted to the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV 2022)",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) compression is crucial to deploying
these models in edge devices with limited resources. Existing channel pruning
algorithms for CNNs have achieved plenty of success on complex models. They
approach the pruning problem from various perspectives and use different
metrics to guide the pruning process. However, these metrics mainly focus on
the model's `outputs' or `weights' and neglect its `interpretations'
information. To fill in this gap, we propose to address the channel pruning
problem from a novel perspective by leveraging the interpretations of a model
to steer the pruning process, thereby utilizing information from both inputs
and outputs of the model. However, existing interpretation methods cannot get
deployed to achieve our goal as either they are inefficient for pruning or may
predict non-coherent explanations. We tackle this challenge by introducing a
selector model that predicts real-time smooth saliency masks for pruned models.
We parameterize the distribution of explanatory masks by Radial Basis Function
(RBF)-like functions to incorporate geometric prior of natural images in our
selector model's inductive bias. Thus, we can obtain compact representations of
explanations to reduce the computational costs of our pruning method. We
leverage our selector model to steer the network pruning by maximizing the
similarity of explanatory representations for the pruned and original models.
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets demonstrate
the efficacy of our proposed method. Our implementations are available at

  representations for a spectrum of Alzheimer's phenotypes",,,,,"cs.LG eess.IV q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent neuroimaging studies that focus on predicting brain disorders via
modern machine learning approaches commonly include a single modality and rely
on supervised over-parameterized models.However, a single modality provides
only a limited view of the highly complex brain. Critically, supervised models
in clinical settings lack accurate diagnostic labels for training. Coarse
labels do not capture the long-tailed spectrum of brain disorder phenotypes,
which leads to a loss of generalizability of the model that makes them less
useful in diagnostic settings. This work presents a novel multi-scale
coordinated framework for learning multiple representations from multimodal
neuroimaging data. We propose a general taxonomy of informative inductive
biases to capture unique and joint information in multimodal self-supervised
fusion. The taxonomy forms a family of decoder-free models with reduced
computational complexity and a propensity to capture multi-scale relationships
between local and global representations of the multimodal inputs. We conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the taxonomy using functional and structural
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data across a spectrum of Alzheimer's disease
phenotypes and show that self-supervised models reveal disorder-relevant brain
regions and multimodal links without access to the labels during pre-training.
The proposed multimodal self-supervised learning yields representations with
improved classification performance for both modalities. The concomitant rich
and flexible unsupervised deep learning framework captures complex multimodal
relationships and provides predictive performance that meets or exceeds that of
a more narrow supervised classification analysis. We present elaborate
quantitative evidence of how this framework can significantly advance our
search for missing links in complex brain disorders.

clarity on collision buffer management which is sometimes omitted in online
literature. For real-world applications, CPU-based implementations of the test
are often deemed too slow to be useful. In contrast, the code described here
targets Nvidia GPU devices and offers a solution that is vastly more efficient

  photoproduction",,,,,"hep-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Very recently, a new hadronic exotic state $\eta_1(1855)$ at the invariant
mass spectrum of $\eta\eta^{'}$ was observed by the BESIII Collaboration.
According to its properties, such as the spectroscopy and decay width, the
$\eta_1(1855)$ have been suggested to be a compact multi-quark state, a hadron
molecule, or a hybrid meson. In order to distinguish the various
interpretations of the $\eta_1(1855)$, a Reggeized model combined with the
vector dominance model for $\eta_1(1855)$ photoproduction on the proton target
is presented. If the $\eta_1(1855)$ is a $s\bar{s}g$ hybrid meson, the
$\eta_1(1855)$ can be produced though the Primakoff effect. However, the
$\eta_1(1855)$ photoproduction is dominated by the $t$-channel vector mesons
$\rho$, $\omega$, and $\phi$ exchange by assuming $\eta_1(1855)$ as an $S$-wave
$K\bar{K}_1(1400)$ molecular state. Our calculations show that the total cross
section of the $\eta_1(1855)$ production via $\gamma{}p$ reaction can reach up
to 0.115 pb, about 0.0124$\%$ of the total cross section obtained by
considering the $\eta_1(1855)$ as an $S$-wave $K\bar{K}_1(1400)$ molecule. We
also find their line shapes are sizably different. If the $\eta_1(1855)$ is a
molecular state, the photoproduction of $\eta_1(1855)$ near the threshold
offers a nice place to test its molecular nature. However, it should be better
to take high energy, at least above $E_{\gamma}=16.97$ GeV, to observe the
production of $\eta_1(1855)$ if $\eta_1(1855)$ is a $s\bar{s}g$ hybrid meson.
These results can be measured in the GlueX experiment or Electron-Ion Collider
in China to test the nature of the $\eta_1(1855)$.

epidemic COVID-19 involving asymptomatic infections and vaccinations to conduct
data forecasts using time-dependent parameters. The forecast by our
deterministic model conducts 10-day predictions to see whether the epidemic
will ease or become more severe in the short term. The forecast by our
stochastic model predicts the probability distributions of the final size and
the maximum size to see how large the epidemic will be in the long run. The
first forecast using the data set from the USA gives the relative errors within
3% in 5 days and 7% in 10 days for the prediction of isolated infectious cases
and smaller ones for the predictions of recoveries and deaths. The
distributions in the second forecast using the time-varying parameters from the
first forecast are also bimodal in our model with time-independent parameters
in our simulations of smaller populations. For the model with time-dependent
model, what are different are that there is another peak in the final size
distribution, that the the probability of minor outbreak is higher and that the
maximum size distribution is oscillating with time-dependent parameters. The
final size distributions are similar between different populations and so are
the maximum size distributions, which means that we can expect that with the
same parameters and in a large population, the ratio of the final size and the
maximum size are distributed similarly (only different by the value of the
second peak). The result shows that under recent transmissibility of this
disease in the USA, when an initial infection is introduced into
all-susceptible (large) population, major outbreak occurs with around 95% of
the population and with high probability the epidemic is maximized to around
30% of the population.

Specifically, we have to tackle two main challenges: (1) there are wasted
parallelism by adopting static synchronization granularity (2) static reduction
strategy limits optimization space exploration. We propose Sgap: segment group
and atomic parallelism to solve these problems. Atomic parallelism captures the
flexible reduction semantics to systematically analyze the optimization space
of sparse-dense hybrid algebra on GPU. It is a new optimization technique
beyond current compiler-based and open-source runtime libraries. Segment group
elevates the flexible reduction semantics to suitable levels of abstraction in
the sparse compilation theory. It adopts changeable group size and user-defined
reduction strategy to solve challenge (1) and (2), respectively. Finally, we
use GPU sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpMM) on the TACO compiler as a
use case to demonstrate the effectiveness of segment group in reduction
semantics elevation. We achieve up to 1.2x speedup over the original TACO's
SpMM kernels. We also apply new optimization techniques found by atomic
parallelism to an open-source state-of-the-art SpMM library dgSPARSE. We
achieve 1.6x - 2.3x speedup on the algorithm tuned with atomic parallelism.

presents a new knowledge representation framework and a transfer strategy
called KT-BT: Knowledge Transfer through Behavior Trees. The KT-BT framework
follows a query-response-update mechanism through an online Behavior Tree
framework, where agents broadcast queries for unknown conditions and respond
with appropriate knowledge using a condition-action-control sub-flow. We embed
a novel grammar structure called stringBT that encodes knowledge, enabling
behavior sharing. We theoretically investigate the properties of the KT-BT
framework in achieving homogeneity of high knowledge across the entire group
compared to a heterogeneous system without the capability of sharing their
knowledge. We extensively verify our framework in a simulated multi-robot

improved group performance in various scenarios. We further study the effects
of opportunities and communication range on group performance, knowledge
spread, and functional heterogeneity in a group of agents, presenting
interesting insights.

study the impact of various non-pharmaceutical interventions in managing an
epidemic in a city (or a region). They provide the flexibility to accurately
model a heterogeneous population with time and location varying,
person-specific interactions as well as detailed governmental mobility
restrictions. Typically, for accuracy, each person is modelled separately. This
however may make computational time prohibitive when the city population and
the simulated time is large. In this paper, we dig deeper into the underlying
probabilistic structure of a generic, locally detailed ABS for epidemiology to
arrive at modifications that allow smaller models (models with less number of
agents) to give accurate statistics for larger ones, thus substantially
speeding up the simulation. We observe that simply considering a smaller
aggregate model and scaling up the output leads to inaccuracies. We exploit the
observation that in the initial disease spread phase, the starting infections
create a family tree of infected individuals more-or-less independent of the
other trees and are modelled well as a multi-type super-critical branching
process. Further, although this branching process grows exponentially, the
relative proportions amongst the population types stabilise quickly. Once
enough people have been infected, the future evolution of the epidemic is
closely approximated by its mean field limit with a random starting state. We
build upon these insights to develop a shifted, scaled and restart-based
algorithm that accurately evaluates the ABS's performance using a much smaller
model while carefully reducing the bias that may otherwise arise. We apply our
algorithm for Covid-19 epidemic in a city and theoretically support the
proposed algorithm through an asymptotic analysis where the population size
increases to infinity.

balance of fluid force, conservation of momentum, and the

weakly by introducing the traces of the structure velocity and the poroelastic

Galerkin type terms. Existence and uniqueness of a solution are established for
the continuous weak formulation, as well as a semidiscrete continuous-in-time

processes can drive turbulence in the disk, existing numerical simulations have
studied them separately. In this paper, we conduct global 3D non-ideal
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations for outer PPDs with ambipolar diffusion
and instantaneous cooling, and hence conductive to both instabilities. Given
the range of ambipolar Els\""{a}sser numbers ($Am$) explored, it is found that
the VSI turbulence dominates over the MRI when ambipolar diffusion is strong
($Am=0.1$); the VSI and MRI can co-exist for $Am=1$; and the VSI is overwhelmed
by the MRI when ambipolar diffusion is weak ($Am=10$). Angular momentum
transport process is primarily driven by MHD winds, while viscous accretion due
to MRI and/or VSI turbulence makes a moderate contribution in most cases.
Spontaneous magnetic flux concentration and formation of annular substructures
remain robust in strong ambipolar diffusion dominated disks ($Am\leq1$) with
the presence of the VSI. Ambipolar diffusion is the major contributor to the

conform to the expected behavior. The prevalent methods mainly detect anomalies
by snippet reconstruction or future frame prediction error. However, the error
is highly dependent on the local context of the current snippet and lacks the
understanding of normality. To address this issue, we propose to detect
anomalous events not only by the local context, but also according to the
consistency between the testing event and the knowledge about normality from
the training data. Concretely, we propose a novel two-stream framework based on
context recovery and knowledge retrieval, where the two streams can complement
each other. For the context recovery stream, we propose a spatiotemporal U-Net
which can fully utilize the motion information to predict the future frame.
Furthermore, we propose a maximum local error mechanism to alleviate the
problem of large recovery errors caused by complex foreground objects. For the
knowledge retrieval stream, we propose an improved learnable locality-sensitive
hashing, which optimizes hash functions via a Siamese network and a mutual
difference loss. The knowledge about normality is encoded and stored in hash
tables, and the distance between the testing event and the knowledge
representation is used to reveal the probability of anomaly. Finally, we fuse
the anomaly scores from the two streams to detect anomalies. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and complementarity of the two
streams, whereby the proposed two-stream framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four datasets.

can be used to empirically determine the total collision cross section and
realize a self-calibrating, vacuum pressure standard. This was previously
validated for Rb+N$_2$ and Rb+Rb collisions. However, the post-collision energy

hyperbolic $\{4,5\}$, $\{8,3\}$ and $\{12,3\}$ lattices, respectively. The
non-Euclidean higher-order topological behavior is characterized by zero-energy
effective corner states appearing in hyperbolic lattices. By adjusting the
variation period of the TRS breaking term, we obtain 4, 8 and 12 zero-energy

states of a hyperbolic lattice depends on the variation period of the TRS

higher-order topology of the hyperbolic lattice with four zero-energy effective
corner states. Via symmetry analysis, it is confirmed that the hyperbolic
zero-energy effective corner states are protected by the particle-hole symmetry
$P$, the effective chiral symmetry $Sm_{z}$, and combined symmetries $C_{p}T$

stable unless these four symmetries are broken simultaneously. The topological

alignment problem in high dimensions finds several novel applications in
practice. However, the research is still rather limited in the algorithmic

the observation that high dimensional data often has a low intrinsic dimension.
Our framework is a ""data-dependent"" approach that has the complexity depending

that running the alignment algorithm on compressed patterns can achieve similar

strategies. To forecast the transmission of COVID-19, a major challenge is the
accurate assessment of the multi-scale human mobility and how they impact the
infection through close contacts. By combining the stochastic agent-based
modeling strategy and hierarchical structures of spatial containers
corresponding to the notion of places in geography, this study proposes a novel
model, Mob-Cov, to study the impact of human traveling behaviour and individual
health conditions on the disease outbreak and the probability of zero COVID in
the population. Specifically, individuals perform power-law type of local
movements within a container and global transport between different-level
containers. Frequent short movements inside a small-level container (e.g. a
road or a county) and a large population size influence the local crowdedness
of people, which accelerates the infection and regional transmission. Travels
between large-level containers (e.g. cities and nations) facilitate global
spread and outbreak. Moreover, dynamic infection and recovery in the population
are able to drive the bifurcation of the system to a ""zero-COVID"" state or a
""live with COVID"" state, depending on the mobility patterns, population number
and health conditions. Reducing total population and local people accumulation
as well as restricting global travels help achieve zero-COVID. In summary, the
Mob-Cov model considers more realistic human mobility in a wide range of
spatial scales, and has been designed with equal emphasis on performance, low
simulation cost, accuracy, ease of use and flexibility. It is a useful tool for
researchers and politicians to investigate the pandemic dynamics and plan
actions against the disease.

magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic materials. Recently, the inertial LLG
equation, which contains an inertial term, has been proposed to capture the
ultra-fast magnetization dynamics at the sub-picosecond timescale.
Mathematically, this generalized model contains the first temporal derivative
and a newly introduced second temporal derivative of magnetization.
Consequently, it produces extra difficulties in numerical analysis due to the
mixed hyperbolic-parabolic type of this equation with degeneracy. In this work,
we propose an implicit finite difference scheme based on the central difference
in both time and space. A fixed point iteration method is applied to solve the
implicit nonlinear system. With the help of a second order accurate constructed
solution, we provide a convergence analysis in $H^1$ for this numerical scheme,
in the $\ell^\infty (0, T; H_h^1)$ norm. It is shown that the proposed method
is second order accurate in both time and space, with unconditional stability
and a natural preservation of the magnetization length. In the hyperbolic
regime, significant damping wave behaviors of magnetization at a shorter
timescale are observed through numerical simulations.

eliminated by repeatedly applying the pulses, without noticeably affecting the

the elements forming the pulses and the desired system interactions, our scheme
is resistant to different types of decoherences, and so not limited to specific
decoherences. Our scheme also works well in the case that the desired system

  Measure",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  There is no, nor will there ever be, single best clustering algorithm, but we
would still like to be able to pinpoint those which are well-performing on
certain task types and filter out the systematically disappointing ones.
Clustering algorithms are traditionally evaluated using either internal or
external validity measures. Internal measures quantify different aspects of the
obtained partitions, e.g., the average degree of cluster compactness or point
separability. Yet, their validity is questionable because the clusterings they
promote can sometimes be meaningless. External measures, on the other hand,
compare the algorithms' outputs to the reference, ground truth groupings that
are provided by experts. The commonly-used classical partition similarity
scores, such as the normalised mutual information, Fowlkes-Mallows, or adjusted
Rand index, might not possess all the desirable properties, e.g., they do not
identify pathological edge cases correctly. Furthermore, they are not nicely
interpretable: it is hard to say what a score of 0.8 really means. Its
behaviour might also vary as the number of true clusters changes. This makes
comparing clustering algorithms across many benchmark datasets difficult. To
remedy this, we propose and analyse a new measure: an asymmetric version of the
optimal set-matching accuracy. It is corrected for chance and the
imbalancedness of cluster sizes.

Conventional methods ask users to specify an appropriate number of clusters as
a hyperparameter, then assume that all input graphs share the same number of
clusters. In inductive settings where the number of clusters can vary, however,
the model should be able to represent this variation in its pooling layers in
order to learn suitable clusters. Thus we propose GMPool, a novel
differentiable graph pooling architecture that automatically determines the
appropriate number of clusters based on the input data. The main intuition
involves a grouping matrix defined as a quadratic form of the pooling operator,
which induces use of binary classification probabilities of pairwise

the grouping matrix, then decomposing it. Extensive evaluations on molecular

study in detail how the accuracy of approximate solutions affect the

NOTEARS[1] recast this combinatorial problem into a continuous optimization

However, the continuous optimization methods suffer from obtaining non-spare

rule out the potentially cycle-inducing edges or false discovery edges with
small values. To address this issue, in this paper, we develop a completely

post-threshold small values. We name our method NOTEARS with adaptive Lasso

key issue in sequential pattern mining (or sequence pattern mining).
Nonoverlapping pattern matching means that two occurrences cannot use the same

allows for some data noise, and is more general than exact pattern matching. At
present, nonoverlapping approximate pattern matching is based on Hamming
distance, which cannot be used to measure the local approximation between the
subsequence and pattern, resulting in large deviations in matching results. To
tackle this issue, we present a Nonoverlapping Delta and gamma approximate
Pattern matching (NDP) scheme that employs the (delta, gamma)-distance to give
an approximate pattern matching, where the local and the global distances do
not exceed delta and gamma, respectively. We first transform the NDP problem
into a local approximate Nettree and then construct an efficient algorithm,
called the local approximate Nettree for NDP (NetNDP). We propose a new
approach called the Minimal Root Distance which allows us to determine whether

invalid nodes and parent-child relationships. NetNDP finds the rightmost
absolute leaf of the max root, searches for the rightmost occurrence from the
rightmost absolute leaf, and deletes this occurrence. We iterate the above
steps until there are no new occurrences. Numerous experiments are used to

the issues of label noise and quantity imbalance in this task, we design a new

salient object detection sub-task, which cooperate with each other and train
alternately. Specifically, the R-Net is designed as a two-stream
encoder-decoder model equipped with Blender with Guidance and Aggregation
Mechanisms (BGA), aiming to rectify the coarse labels for more reliable
pseudo-labels, while the S-Net is a replaceable SOD network supervised by the
pseudo labels generated by the current R-Net. Note that, we only need to use
the trained S-Net for testing. Moreover, in order to guarantee the
effectiveness and efficiency of network training, we design three training
strategies, including alternate iteration mechanism, group-wise incremental

clue than conventionally used class-frequency to decide the distribution of
weights. A heuristic formulation was used in the previous work for quantifying
the difficulty, but we empirically find that the optimal formulation varies
depending on the characteristics of datasets. Therefore, we propose
Difficulty-Net, which learns to predict the difficulty of classes using the
model's performance in a meta-learning framework. To make it learn reasonable
difficulty of a class within the context of other classes, we newly introduce
two key concepts, namely the relative difficulty and the driver loss. The
former helps Difficulty-Net take other classes into account when calculating
difficulty of a class, while the latter is indispensable for guiding the
learning to a meaningful direction. Extensive experiments on popular
long-tailed datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method, and
it achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple long-tailed datasets.

magnons for quantum information processing. An important issue is to examine
the stability of quantum states of magnons against various relaxation and
dephasing channels. Since the interaction of magnons in magnetic systems may
fall in the ultra-strong and even deep-strong coupling regimes, the relaxation
process of magnon states is quite different from the more common quantum
optical systems. Here we study the relaxation and dephasing of magnons based on
the Lindblad formalism and derive a generalized master equation that describes
the quantum dynamics of magnons. Employing this master equation, we identify
two distinct dissipation channels for squeezed magnons, i.e., the local
dissipation and collective dissipation, which play a role for both ferromagnets
and antiferromagnets. The local dissipation is caused by the independent
exchange of angular momentum between the magnonic system and the environment,
while the collective dissipation is dressed by the parametric interactions of
magnons and it enhances the quantumness and thermal stability of squeezed
magnons. Further, we show how this formalism can be applied to study the pure
dephasing of magnons caused by four-magnon scattering and magnon-phonon
interactions. Our results provide the theoretical tools to study the
decoherence of magnons within a full quantum-mechanical framework and further
benefit the use of quantum states of magnons for information processing.

completion due to its ability to capture the global low-rankness of
higher-order (>3) tensors. On the other hand, recently, quaternions have proven
to be a very suitable framework for encoding color pixels, and have obtained
outstanding performance in various color image processing tasks. In this paper,
the quaternion tensor train (QTT) decomposition is presented, and based on that
the quaternion TT-rank (QTT-rank) is naturally defined, which are the
generalizations of their counterparts in the real number field. In addition, to
utilize the local sparse prior of the quaternion tensor, a general and flexible
transform framework is defined. Combining both the global low-rank and local
sparse priors of the quaternion tensor, we propose a novel quaternion tensor
completion model, i.e., QTT-rank minimization with sparse regularization in a
transformed domain. Specifically, we use the quaternion weighted nuclear norm
(QWNN) of mode-n canonical unfolding quaternion matrices to characterize the
global low-QTT-rankness, and the l1-norm of the quaternion tensor in a
transformed domain to characterize the local sparse property. Moreover, to
enable the QTT-rank minimization to handle color images and better handle color
videos, we generalize KA, a tensor augmentation method, to quaternion tensors
and define quaternion KA (QKA), which is a helpful pretreatment step for
QTT-rank based optimization problems. The numerical experiments on color images
and color videos inpainting tasks indicate the advantages of the proposed
method over the state-of-the-art ones.

for the approximation of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). PINNs
approximate the PDE solution by minimizing physics-based loss functions over a
given domain. Despite substantial progress in the application of PINNs to a
range of problem classes, investigation of error estimation and convergence
properties of PINNs, which is important for establishing the rationale behind
their good empirical performance, has been lacking. This paper presents
convergence analysis and error estimates of PINNs for a multi-physics problem
of thermally coupled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Through a model
problem of Beltrami flow it is shown that a small training error implies a
small generalization error. Posteriori convergence rates of total error with
respect to the training residual and collocation points are presented. This is
of practical significance in determining appropriate number of training
parameters and training residual thresholds to get good PINNs prediction of
thermally coupled steady state laminar flows. These convergence rates are then
generalized to different spatial geometries as well as to different flow
parameters that lie in the laminar regime. A pressure stabilization term in the
form of pressure Poisson equation is added to the PDE residuals for PINNs. This
physics informed augmentation is shown to improve accuracy of the pressure
field by an order of magnitude as compared to the case without augmentation.
Results from PINNs are compared to the ones obtained from stabilized finite

significantly compromise the WCS's performance. This paper focuses on the
controller design for the MAS to ensure the performance of WCS in the presence

necessary and sufficient condition in terms of constrained set stabilization is
then established to ensure the Lyapunov-like performance with expected decay

We frame the problem of incorporating constructive and contextual feedback into

in classification. The existing work largely focuses on designing incremental
neural networks with more complicated adjacent matrices to capture the details
of joints relationships. However, they still have difficulties distinguishing
actions that have broadly similar motion patterns but belong to different
categories. Interestingly, we found that the subtle differences in motion
patterns can be significantly amplified and become easy for audience to
distinct through specified view directions, where this property haven't been
fully explored before. Drastically different from previous work, we boost the
performance by proposing a conceptually simple yet effective Multi-view
strategy that recognizes actions from a collection of dynamic view features.
Specifically, we design a novel Skeleton-Anchor Proposal (SAP) module which
contains a Multi-head structure to learn a set of views. For feature learning
of different views, we introduce a novel Angle Representation to transform the
actions under different views and feed the transformations into the baseline
model. Our module can work seamlessly with the existing action classification
model. Incorporated with baseline models, our SAP module exhibits clear
performance gains on many challenging benchmarks. Moreover, comprehensive
experiments show that our model consistently beats down the state-of-the-art

spectroscopy of the low lying electronic states and potentially to identify

Specifically, we show that the combination of magnetic field, weak disorder and

the random matrix theory predictions. Such a phenomenology is very general and
should apply to most platforms trying to realize topological superconductivity
in 1D systems, thus calling for alternative probes to reveal it.

(neural) ordinary differential equation (ODE) models to transport between two
empirically observed distributions \pi_0 and \pi_1, hence providing a unified
solution to generative modeling and domain transfer, among various other tasks
involving distribution transport. The idea of rectified flow is to learn the
ODE to follow the straight paths connecting the points drawn from \pi_0 and
\pi_1 as much as possible. This is achieved by solving a straightforward
nonlinear least squares optimization problem, which can be easily scaled to
large models without introducing extra parameters beyond standard supervised
learning. The straight paths are special and preferred because they are the
shortest paths between two points, and can be simulated exactly without time
discretization and hence yield computationally efficient models. We show that
the procedure of learning a rectified flow from data, called rectification,
turns an arbitrary coupling of \pi_0 and \pi_1 to a new deterministic coupling
with provably non-increasing convex transport costs. In addition, recursively
applying rectification allows us to obtain a sequence of flows with
increasingly straight paths, which can be simulated accurately with coarse time
discretization in the inference phase. In empirical studies, we show that
rectified flow performs superbly on image generation, image-to-image
translation, and domain adaptation. In particular, on image generation and

gravitational waves has gained momentum as it has been shown that the strain
sensitivities of such detectors are of the same order of sensitivity to the
axion-photon theta angle. Thus, after calculating the sensitivity of a
haloscope to an axion signal, we also have calculated the order of magnitude
sensitivity to a gravitational wave signal of the same spectral and temporal
form. However, it is unlikely that a gravitational wave and an axion signal
will be of the same form, since physically the way the signals are generated
are completely different. For gravitational wave detection, the spectral strain
sensitivity is in units strain per square root Hz, is the natural way to
compare the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors due to its independence
on the gravitational wave signal. In this work, we introduce a systematic way
to calculate the spectral sensitivity of an axion haloscope, so instrument
comparison may be achieved independent of signal assumptions and only depends
on the axion to signal transduction sensitivity and noise in the instrument.
Thus, the calculation of the spectral sensitivity not only allows the
comparison of dissimilar axion detectors independent of signal, but also allows
us to compare the order of magnitude gravitational wave sensitivity in terms of
spectral strain sensitivity, allowing comparisons to standard gravitational
wave detectors based on optical interferometers and resonant-mass technology.

this way, the model could check the prediction from the graph and generate new

experiments on two multi-hop KBQA benchmarks and outperform the existing

and $M$ unknown quantum measurements $\mathcal{M}_1,...,\mathcal{M}_M$ with
$K\geq 2$ outcomes, estimating the probability distribution for applying
$\mathcal{M}_i$ on $\rho$ to within total variation distance $\epsilon$.
Compared to the special case when $K=2$, we need to learn unknown distributions
instead of values. We develop an online shadow tomography procedure that solves
this problem with high success probability requiring $\tilde{O}(K\log^2M\log

lower bound that at least $\Omega(\min\{d^2,K+\log M\}/\epsilon^2)$ copies of

shadow tomography procedure requires sample complexity with only logarithmic

of shrink-masks from the background by semantic information. However, the
feature defocusing phenomenon that coarse layers are optimized by fine-grained
objectives limits the extraction of semantic features. Meanwhile, since both
shrink-masks and the margins belong to texts, the detail loss phenomenon that
the margins are ignored hinders the distinguishment of shrink-masks from the

samples enjoy similar visual features with shrink-masks. They aggravate the
decline of shrink-masks recognition. To avoid the above problems, we propose a

Although existing contour point sequence-based approaches achieve comparable
performances, they fail to cover some highly curved ribbon-like text lines. It
leads to limited text fitting ability and STD technique application.
Considering the above problem, we combine text geometric characteristics and
bionics to design a natural leaf vein-based text representation method (LVT).
Concretely, it is found that leaf vein is a generally directed graph, which can
easily cover various geometries. Inspired by it, we treat text contour as leaf
margin and represent it through main, lateral, and thin veins. We further
construct a detection framework based on LVT, namely LeafText. In the text
reconstruction stage, LeafText simulates the leaf growth process to rebuild
text contour. It grows main vein in Cartesian coordinates to locate text
roughly at first. Then, lateral and thin veins are generated along the main
vein growth direction in polar coordinates. They are responsible for generating
coarse contour and refining it, respectively. Considering the deep dependency
of lateral and thin veins on main vein, the Multi-Oriented Smoother (MOS) is
proposed to enhance the robustness of main vein to ensure a reliable detection
result. Additionally, we propose a global incentive loss to accelerate the
predictions of lateral and thin veins. Ablation experiments demonstrate LVT is
able to depict arbitrary-shaped texts precisely and verify the effectiveness of
MOS and global incentive loss. Comparisons show that LeafText is superior to
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on MSRA-TD500, CTW1500, Total-Text,
and ICDAR2015 datasets.

cluster-NGC 2360 and globular clusters-NGC 5272 are presented extensively in
this work. Here, the evaluation of stellar parameters, by manually fitting the
appropriate isochrones on the color magnitude diagrams (CMDs), of the selected
star clusters is discussed comprehensively. Aperture photometry and PSF fitting
photometry are conducted on g, r, and i standard band filter images of Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) using the aperture photometry tool (APT) to obtain
the respective CMDs. Further, to achieve the stellar parameters, isochrone
fitting is described in detail. This work on stellar parameters evaluation has
attained the following results: age of NGC 2360 is found to be 708 Myrs with
metallicity, [Fe/H], of -0.15, whereas NGC 5272 is having age of 11.56 Gyrs
with metallicity, [Fe/H], of -1.57. Additionally, the interstellar reddening,
E(B-V), and distance modulus, DM, for NGC 2360 are obtained as 0.12 and 11.65,
respectively. While, for NGC 5272, the interstellar reddening is attained as
E(B-V)=0.015, and the distance modulus is DM=15.1. The values of these stellar
parameters are found to be in close approximation with the results provided in
the literature based on the IRAF analysis technique. The distribution of radii,
masses, and temperatures are included along with the initial mass function
(IMF) for both the start clusters. Thus, this article would aid in providing
insight into the evaluation of stellar parameters by the astronomical
photometry analysis which would successively upsurge the understanding of our
universe. It should be noted that the cleaning of cluster population on the
CMDs from the foreground/background stars, clearing of spurious objects, error
estimations and the membership determination are not carried out in this work
and are considered as separate project for analysis.

more) future observation(s) with a given coverage probability and is usually
computed based on historical control data. The application of prediction
intervals is discussed in many fields of research, such as toxicology,
pre-clinical statistics, engineering, assay validation or for the assessment of
replication studies. Anyhow, the prediction intervals implemented in predint
descent from previous work that was done in the context of toxicology and
pre-clinical applications. Hence the implemented methodology reflects the data
structures that are common in these fields of research. In toxicology the
historical data is often comprised of dichotomous or counted endpoints. Hence
it seems natural to model these kind of data based on the binomial or the
Poisson distribution. Anyhow, the historical control data is usually comprised
of several studies. These clustering gives rise to possible overdispersion
which has to be reflected for interval calculation. In pre-clinical statistics,
the endpoints are often assumed to be normal distributed, but usually are not
independent from each other due to the experimental design (cross-classified
and/or hierarchical structures). These dependencies can be modeled based on
linear random effects models. Hence, predint provides functions for the
calculation of prediction intervals and one-sided bounds for overdispersed
binomial data, for overdispersed Poisson data and for data that is modeled by
linear random effects models.

chemical oscillations. However, the models used either lack a systematic
analysis of the mechanism and properties of oscillation, or are too complex to

few labeled instances. Many few-shot visual recognition methods adopt the
metric-based meta-learning paradigm by comparing the query representation with
class representations to predict the category of query instance. However,
current metric-based methods generally treat all instances equally and
consequently often obtain biased class representation, considering not all
instances are equally significant when summarizing the instance-level
representations for the class-level representation. For example, some instances
may contain unrepresentative information, such as too much background and
information of unrelated concepts, which skew the results. To address the above
issues, we propose a novel metric-based meta-learning framework termed
instance-adaptive class representation learning network (ICRL-Net) for few-shot
visual recognition. Specifically, we develop an adaptive instance revaluing
network with the capability to address the biased representation issue when
generating the class representation, by learning and assigning adaptive weights
for different instances according to their relative significance in the support
set of corresponding class. Additionally, we design an improved bilinear
instance representation and incorporate two novel structural losses, i.e.,
intra-class instance clustering loss and inter-class representation
distinguishing loss, to further regulate the instance revaluation process and
refine the class representation. We conduct extensive experiments on four
commonly adopted few-shot benchmarks: miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CIFAR-FS,

analyse the blue spectrum (4000-4500 {\AA}) of Proxima Cen (M5.5 V). Comparison
of the observed and computed spectra enables the identification of a large
number of 27AlH lines of the A1{\Pi} - X1{\Sigma}+ band system: the spectral
range covering 1-0, 0-0 and 1-1 bands is dominated by clearly resolved AlH
lines. We reveal the diffuse nature of transitions close to the dissociation
limit which appears in the form of increasingly wider(up to 5 {\AA}) and
shallower (up to the continuum confusion limit) AlH line profiles. The
predicted wavelengths of AlH diffuse lines are systematically displaced. The
effect broadening by pre-dissociation states on the line profiles is included
by increasing the radiative damping rate by up to 5 orders of magnitude. We
determine empirical values of damping rates for a number of the clean 0-0
Q-branch transitions by comparing the observed and synthetic stellar spectra.
We find excellent agreement between our damping rates and lifetimes available
in the literature. A comparison of 27Al1H ExoMol and REALH spectra shows that
the observed spectrum is better described by the ExoMol line list. A search for
26Al1H lines in the Proxima Cen spectrum does not reveal any notable features;
giving an upper limit of 27Al1H/26Al1H {>} 100.

  More generally for $p\in (1,\infty)$ we obtain the norm-one inclusion

atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos between 1 GeV and 1 PeV, is deployed
1.45 km to 2.45 km below the surface of the ice sheet at the South Pole. The
classification and reconstruction of events from the in-ice detectors play a
central role in the analysis of data from IceCube. Reconstructing and
classifying events is a challenge due to the irregular detector geometry,
inhomogeneous scattering and absorption of light in the ice and, below 100 GeV,
the relatively low number of signal photons produced per event. To address this
challenge, it is possible to represent IceCube events as point cloud graphs and
use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) as the classification and reconstruction
method. The GNN is capable of distinguishing neutrino events from cosmic-ray
backgrounds, classifying different neutrino event types, and reconstructing the
deposited energy, direction and interaction vertex. Based on simulation, we
provide a comparison in the 1-100 GeV energy range to the current
state-of-the-art maximum likelihood techniques used in current IceCube
analyses, including the effects of known systematic uncertainties. For neutrino
event classification, the GNN increases the signal efficiency by 18% at a fixed
false positive rate (FPR), compared to current IceCube methods. Alternatively,
the GNN offers a reduction of the FPR by over a factor 8 (to below half a
percent) at a fixed signal efficiency. For the reconstruction of energy,
direction, and interaction vertex, the resolution improves by an average of
13%-20% compared to current maximum likelihood techniques in the energy range
of 1-30 GeV. The GNN, when run on a GPU, is capable of processing IceCube
events at a rate nearly double of the median IceCube trigger rate of 2.7 kHz,
which opens the possibility of using low energy neutrinos in online searches
for transient events.

multilayered sphere. Usually, the incident beam is expanded to its vector
spherical harmonic representation defined by beam shape coefficients, and the
multilayer sphere scattering is obtained by the T-matrix method. However,
obtaining the beam shape coefficients for arbitrarily shaped incident beams has
limitations on source locations and requires different methods when the
incident beam is defined inside or outside the computational domain or at the
scatterer surface. We propose a 3D angular spectrum method for defining beam
shape coefficients from arbitrary source field distributions. This method
enables the placement of the sources freely within the computational domain
without singularities, allowing flexibility in beam design. We demonstrate
incident field synthesis and spherical scattering by comparing
morphology-dependent resonances to known values, achieving excellent matching
and high accuracy. Additionally, we present mathematical proof to support our
proposal. The proposed method has significant benefits for optical systems and
inverse beam design. It allows for the analysis of electromagnetic
forward/backward propagation between optical elements and spherical targets
using a single method. It is also valuable for optical force beam design and
analysis.

uniqueness assumption on the minimiser we show several theoretical results, in
particular well-posedness of the method and an error bound due to the induced

theory to integrate the measure-based lifting scheme into an alternating update
method for joint homogeneous 3D map reconstruction and rotation estimation,
where typically tens of thousands of manifold-valued minimisation problems have
to be solved and where regularisation is necessary because of the high noise
levels in the data. The joint recovery method is used to test both the
theoretical predictions and algorithmic performance through numerical
experiments with Cryo-EM data. In particular, the induced bias due to the
regularising effect of ESL empirically estimates better rotations, i.e.,
rotations closer to the ground truth, than global optimisation would.

development trajectories with the characteristics of the donor pool of 66
countries with no armed internal conflict in the period 1996-2021, we estimate
a series of growth and development gaps attributed to civil war. Syrian civil
war appears to have had a temporary negative effect on the trajectory of
economic growth that almost disappeared before the onset of COVID19 pandemic.
By contrast, the civil war led to unprecedented losses in human development,
rising infant mortality and rampantly deteriorating institutional quality. Down
to the present day, each year of the conflict led to 5,700 additional
under-five child deaths with permanently derailed negative effect on longevity.
The civil war led to unprecedent and permanent deterioration in institutional
quality indicated by pervasive weakening of the rule of law and deleterious
impacts on government effectiveness, civil liberties and widespread escalation
of corruption. The estimated effects survive a battery of placebo checks.

discretised data. In some cases, the data contains singularities which position
is known but does not coincide with a discretisation point, and the jumps in
the function and its derivatives are available at these positions. The
motivation of this paper is to use the previous information to obtain numerical
quadrature formulas that allow approximating the integral of the discrete data
over certain intervals accurately. This work is devoted to the construction and
analysis of a new nonlinear technique that allows to obtain accurate numerical
integrations of any order using data that contains singularities, and when the
integrand is only known at grid points. The novelty of the technique consists
in the inclusion of correction terms with a closed expression that depends on
the size of the jumps of the function and its derivatives at the singularities,
that are supposed to be known. The addition of these terms allows recovering
the accuracy of classical numerical integration formulas even close to the
singularities, as these correction terms account for the error that the
classical integration formulas commit up to their accuracy at smooth zones.
Thus, the correction terms can be added during the integration or as
post-processing, which is useful if the main calculation of the integral has
been already done using classical formulas. The numerical experiments performed
allow us to confirm the theoretical conclusions reached in this paper.

approaches, e.g., to predict the adversary's next actions based on past events.
Building accurate prediction models requires knowledge from many organizations;
alas, this entails disclosing sensitive information, such as network
structures, security postures, and policies, which might often be undesirable
or outright impossible. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using
Federated Learning (FL) to predict future security events. To this end, we
introduce Cerberus, a system enabling collaborative training of Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) models for participating organizations. The intuition is
that FL could potentially offer a middle-ground between the non-private
approach where the training data is pooled at a central server and the
low-utility alternative of only training local models. We instantiate Cerberus
on a dataset obtained from a major security company's intrusion prevention
product and evaluate it vis-a-vis utility, robustness, and privacy, as well as
how participants contribute to and benefit from the system. Overall, our work
sheds light on both the positive aspects and the challenges of using FL for
this task and paves the way for deploying federated approaches to predictive
security.

allowed to determine the first direct upper limit of 4.0$\,\times\,$10$^{-11}$

conductance is half-quantized in the unit e^{2}/h when the parity symmetry is

protected by the local parity symmetry and the topologically nontrivial band

Therefore, in this paper, we built an efficient Scalable, Parallelized Wavelet
Neural Network (SPWNN) which employs the parallel stochastic gradient algorithm
(SGD) algorithm. SPWNN is designed and developed under both static and
streaming environments in the horizontal parallelization framework. SPWNN is
implemented by using Morlet and Gaussian functions as activation functions.
This study is conducted on big datasets like gas sensor data which has more
than 4 million samples and medical research data which has more than 10,000
features, which are high dimensional in nature. The experimental analysis
indicates that in the static environment, SPWNN with Morlet activation function
outperformed SPWNN with Gaussian on the classification datasets. However, in
the case of regression, the opposite was observed. In contrast, in the
streaming environment i.e., Gaussian outperformed Morlet on the classification

contrary to previous claims, observations are consistent with equipartition
between relativistic electrons and magnetic field as well as a constant
mass-loss rate of the progenitor star prior to the supernova explosion. The
reason for this difference is the need to include cooling directly in the
fitting procedure rather than estimating its effects afterward. It is
emphasized that the inferred properties of the supernova ejecta are sensitive
to the time evolution of the synchrotron self-absorption frequency; hence,
great care should be taken when modeling spectra for which cooling and/or
inhomogeneities are indicated. Furthermore, it is noted that the energies of
the relativistic electrons in the radio emission regions in supernovae are
likely too low for first-order Fermi acceleration to be effective.

exhibit a transition from the extended phase to the localized phase, in which
the states at the boundaries or mobility edges may exhibit multifractality.
Meanwhile, the Critical Phase (CP), where all states exhibit multifractal
structures, has also attracted much attention in the past decades. However, a
generic way to construct the CP on demand still remains elusive. Here, a
general approach for this phase is presented using two coupled quasiperiodic
chains, where the chains are chosen so that before coupling one of them has
extended states while the other one has localized states. We demonstrate the
existence of CP in the overlapped spectra in the presence of inter-chain
coupling using fractal dimension and minimal scaling index based on
multifractal analysis. Then we examine the generality of this physics by
changing the forms of inter-chain coupling and quasiperiodic potential, where
the CP also emerges in the overlapped spectra. We account for the emergence of
this phase as a result of effective unbounded potential, which yields singular
continuous spectra and excludes the extended states in the overlapped regimes.
Finally, the realization of this CP in the continuous model using ultracold
atoms with bichromatic incommensurate optical lattice is also discussed. Due to
the tunability of the two chains, this work provides a general approach to
realizing the CP in a tunable way. This approach may have wide applications in
the experimental detection of CP and can be generalized to much more intriguing
physics in the presence of interaction for the many-body CP.

cannot capture all relevant information easily or at all. Digital Twins close
this gap with virtual probes in real-time simulations, synchronized with the
process. This paper proposes a physics-based, data-driven Digital Twin
framework for autonomous food processing. We suggest a lean Digital Twin
concept that is executable at the device level, entailing minimal computational
load, data storage, and sensor data requirements. This study focuses on a
parsimonious experimental design for training non-intrusive reduced-order
models (ROMs) of a thermal process. A correlation ($R=-0.76$) between a high
standard deviation of the surface temperatures in the training data and a low
root mean square error in ROM testing enables efficient selection of training
data. The mean test root mean square error of the best ROM is less than 1
Kelvin (0.2 % mean average percentage error) on representative test sets.
Simulation speed-ups of Sp $\approx$ 1.8E4 allow on-device model predictive
control.
  The proposed Digital Twin framework is designed to be applicable within the
industry. Typically, non-intrusive reduced-order modeling is required as soon
as the modeling of the process is performed in software, where root-level
access to the solver is not provided, such as commercial simulation software.
The data-driven training of the reduced-order model is achieved with only one
data set, as correlations are utilized to predict the training success a
priori.

inspires us to think whether the linear separability of MIM pre-trained

performance. Since MIM and contrastive learning tend to utilize different data
augmentations and training strategies, combining these two pretext tasks is not
trivial. In this work, we propose a novel and flexible pre-training framework,

pre-training. Specifically, MimCo takes a pre-trained contrastive learning
model as the teacher model and is pre-trained with two types of learning
targets: patch-level and image-level reconstruction losses.
  Extensive transfer experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate the superior
performance of our MimCo pre-training framework. Taking ViT-S as an example,

hypersurface singularities, such as cusps, intersections and swallowtail
catastrophes. Here we topologically classify the intersection singularity of
exceptional surfaces for a generic pseudo-Hermitian system with parity-time
symmetry. By constructing the quotient space under equivalence relations of
eigenstates, we reveal that the topology of such gapless structures can be
described by a non-Abelian free group on three generators. Importantly, the
classification predicts a new kind of non-Hermitian gapless topological phase
and can systematically explain how the exceptional surfaces and their
intersections evolve under perturbations with symmetries preserved. Our work
opens a new pathway for designing systems with robust topological phases, and
provides inspiration for applications such as sensing and lasing which can
utilize the special properties inherent in exceptional surfaces and
intersections.

objective for many established as well as many novel algorithms for
unsupervised learning. Learning algorithms change model parameters such that
the variational lower bound increases. Learning usually proceeds until
parameters have converged to values close to a stationary point of the learning
dynamics. In this purely theoretical contribution, we show that (for a very
large class of generative models) the variational lower bound is at all
stationary points of learning equal to a sum of entropies. For standard machine
learning models with one set of latents and one set observed variables, the sum
consists of three entropies: (A) the (average) entropy of the variational
distributions, (B) the negative entropy of the model's prior distribution, and
(C) the (expected) negative entropy of the observable distributions. The
obtained result applies under realistic conditions including: finite numbers of
data points, at any stationary points (including saddle points) and for any
family of (well behaved) variational distributions. The class of generative
models for which we show the equality to entropy sums contains many well-known
generative models. As concrete examples we discuss Sigmoid Belief Networks,
probabilistic PCA and (Gaussian and non-Gaussian) mixture models. The results
also apply for standard (Gaussian) variational autoencoders, which has been
shown in parallel (Damm et al., 2023). The prerequisites we use to show
equality to entropy sums are relatively mild. Concretely, the distributions of
a given generative model have to be of the exponential family (with constant
base measure), and the model has to satisfy a parameterization criterion (which
is usually fulfilled). Proving the equality of the ELBO to entropy sums at
stationary points (under the stated conditions) is the main contribution of
this work.

semiconducting configurations are observed as a function of CO passivation
coverage. We also compute the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of various

of CO concentration is also investigated which suggests a viable way to not

assemble in the early universe. Finding signposts of such over-dense regions is
a popular method to identify protocluster candidates. Hyperluminous infrared

halos. We study the Mpc-scale environment of the largest HLIRG sample to date
and investigate whether they predominantly live in overdense regions. We first
explore the surface density of Herschel 250 $\mu$m sources around HLIRGs and
compare with that around random positions. Then, we compare the spatial
distribution of neighbours around HLIRGs with that around randomly selected
galaxies using a deep IRAC-selected catalogue with good-quality photometric
redshifts. We also use a redshift-matched quasar sample and submillimeter
galaxy (SMG) sample to validate our method, as previous clustering studies have
measured the host halo masses of these populations. Finally, we adopt a Friends

that HLIRGs tend to have more bright star-forming neighbours (with 250 $\mu$m

nickel compound exhibits a combination of magnetic and nuclear
incommensurabil-ity below N\'eel temperature. Despite the fact that the
zero-field behavior has been previously addressed, here we study in depth the
macroscopic magnetic behavior of this compound to unveil the origin of the
atypical magnetic response found in it and in its parent family of formate
perovskites. In particular, they show a puzzling magnetization reversal in the
curves measured starting from low temperatures, after cooling under zero field.
The first atypical phenomena is the im-possibility of reaching zero
magnetization, even by nullifying the applied external field and even
compensating it for the influence earth's magnetic field. Relatively large
magnetic fields are needed to switch the magnetization from negative to
positive values or vice versa, which is compatible with a soft-ferromagnetic
system. The atypical path found in its first magnetization curve and hysteresis
loop at low temperatures is the most noticeable feature. The magnetization
curve switches from more than 1200 Oe from the first magnetization loop to the
subsequent magnetization loops. A feature that cannot be explained using a
model based on unbalanced pair of domains. As a result, we decipher this
behavior in light of the incommensurate structure of this material. We propose,
in particular, that the applied magnetic field induces a mag-netic phase
transition from a magnetically incommensurate structure to a magnetically
commensurate structure.

solutions found by an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm in
some studies. It has been shown that a selected solution subset from the stored
solutions is often better than the final population. However, the use of the
unbounded archive is not always realistic. When the number of examined
solutions is huge, we must pre-specify the archive size. In this study, we
examine the effects of the archive size on three aspects: (i) the quality of
the selected final solution set, (ii) the total computation time for the
archive maintenance and the final solution set selection, and (iii) the
required memory size. Unsurprisingly, the increase of the archive size improves
the final solution set quality. Interestingly, the total computation time of a
medium-size archive is much larger than that of a small-size archive and a
huge-size archive (e.g., an unbounded archive). To decrease the computation
time, we examine two ideas: periodical archive update and archiving only in
later generations. Compared with updating the archive at every generation, the
first idea can obtain almost the same final solution set quality using a much
shorter computation time at the cost of a slight increase of the memory size.
The second idea drastically decreases the computation time at the cost of a
slight deterioration of the final solution set quality. Based on our
experimental results, some suggestions are given about how to appropriately
choose an archiving strategy and an archive size.

reliable 3D object detection in autonomous driving systems. This is challenging
due to the difficulty of combining multi-granularity geometric and semantic
features from two drastically different modalities. Recent approaches aim at
exploring the semantic densities of camera features through lifting points in
2D camera images (referred to as seeds) into 3D space, and then incorporate 2D
semantics via cross-modal interaction or fusion techniques. However, depth
information is under-investigated in these approaches when lifting points into
3D space, thus 2D semantics can not be reliably fused with 3D points. Moreover,
their multi-modal fusion strategy, which is implemented as concatenation or
attention, either can not effectively fuse 2D and 3D information or is unable
to perform fine-grained interactions in the voxel space. To this end, we
propose a novel framework with better utilization of the depth information and
fine-grained cross-modal interaction between LiDAR and camera, which consists
of two important components. First, a Multi-Depth Unprojection (MDU) method
with depth-aware designs is used to enhance the depth quality of the lifted
points at each interaction level. Second, a Gated Modality-Aware Convolution
(GMA-Conv) block is applied to modulate voxels involved with the camera
modality in a fine-grained manner and then aggregate multi-modal features into
a unified space. Together they provide the detection head with more
comprehensive features from LiDAR and camera. On the nuScenes test benchmark,
our proposed method, abbreviated as MSMDFusion, achieves state-of-the-art 3D
object detection results with 71.5% mAP and 74.0% NDS, and strong tracking
results with 74.0% AMOTA without using test-time-augmentation and ensemble

collision system at RHIC and LHC can be a more sensitive probe of the
neutron-skin thickness $\Delta r_{\mathrm{np}}$ and the slope parameter $L$ of
the symmetry energy. The idea is demonstrated based on the proton and neutron
density distributions of colliding nuclei obtained from
Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov calculations, and a Glauber model that provides
information of spectator matter. The final spectator particles are produced
from direct emission, clusterization by a minimum spanning tree algorithm or a
Wigner function approach, and deexcitation of heavy clusters by GEMINI. A
larger $\Delta r_{\mathrm{np}}$ associated with a larger $L$ value increases
the isospin asymmetry of spectator matter and thus leads to a larger $N_n/N_p$,
especially in ultracentral collisions where the multiplicity of free nucleons
are free from the uncertainties of cluster formation and deexcitation. We have
further shown that the double ratio of $N_n/N_p$ in isobaric collision systems

CPPN-NEAT and constrained novelty search in the latent space (defined by the
current autoencoder). We apply a set of repair and constraint functions to
ensure candidates adhere to basic structural rules and constraints during
evolution. During transformation, we reshape the boundaries of the latent space
to identify new interesting areas of the solution space by retraining the
autoencoder with novel content. In this study we evaluate five different
approaches for training the autoencoder during transformation and its impact on
populations' quality and diversity during evolution. Our results show that by
retraining the autoencoder we can achieve better open-ended complexity compared
to a static model, which is further improved when retraining using larger
datasets of individuals with diverse complexities.

[0,N]$ where $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is a fixed quadriculated disk and $N \in
\mathbb{N}$. A flip is a local move in the space of tilings $\mathcal{T}(R_N)$:
remove two adjacent dominoes and place them back after a rotation. The twist is
a flip invariant which associates an integer number to each tiling. For some
disks $D$, called regular, two tilings of $R_N$ with the same twist can be
joined by a sequence of flips once we add vertical space to the cylinder. We
have that if $D$ is regular then the size of the largest connected component
under flips of $\mathcal{T}(R_N)$ is
$\Theta(N^{-\frac{1}{2}}|\mathcal{T}(R_N)|)$. The domino group $G_D$ captures
information of the space of tilings. It is known that $D$ is regular if and
only if $G_{D}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/(2)$;
sufficiently large rectangles are regular.
  We prove that certain families of disks are irregular. We show that the
existence of a bottleneck in a disk $D$ often implies irregularity. In many,
but not all, of these cases, we also prove that $D$ is strongly irregular,
i.e., that there exists a surjective homomorphism from $G_{D}^+$ (a subgroup of
index two of $G_{D}$) to the free group of rank two. Moreover, we show that if
$D$ is strongly irregular then the cardinality of the largest connected
component under flips of $\mathcal{T}(R_N)$ is $O(c^N |\mathcal{T}(R_N)|)$ for
some $c \in (0,1)$.

in-equivalent contributions from the constituent $p$-orbitals. While the
overall spin-orbital texture for each Se sublayer is in strict adherence to
time-reversal symmetry (TRS), spin-orbital mixing terms with net polarisations
at time-reversal invariant momenta are locally maintained. These apparent
TRS-breaking contributions dominate, and can be selectively tuned between with
a choice of linear light polarisation, facilitating the observation of
pronounced spin-polarisations at the Brillouin zone centre for all $k_z$. We

i.e. a single tumor can exhibit multiple regions that behave differently during

observed in control group tumors can obscure detection of significant
therapeutic effects due to the ambiguity in attributing causes of change. This
can hinder development of effective therapies due to limitations in
experimental design, rather than due to therapeutic failure. An improved method
to model biological variation and heterogeneity in imaging signals is
described. Specifically, Linear Poisson modelling (LPM) evaluates changes in
apparent diffusion co-efficient (ADC) before and 72 hours after radiotherapy,
in two xenograft models of colorectal cancer. The statistical significance of
measured changes are compared to those attainable using a conventional t-test
analysis on basic ADC distribution parameters. When LPMs were applied to
treated tumors, the LPMs detected highly significant changes. The analyses were
significant for all tumors, equating to a gain in power of 4 fold (i.e.
equivelent to having a sample size 16 times larger), compared with the
conventional approach. In contrast, highly significant changes are only
detected at a cohort level using t-tests, restricting their potential use
within personalised medicine and increasing the number of animals required
during testing. Furthermore, LPM enabled the relative volumes of responding and
non-responding tissue to be estimated for each xenograft model. Leave-one-out
analysis of the treated xenografts provided quality control and identified
potential outliers, raising confidence in LPM data at clinically relevant

ports and harbors as well as harsh and dangerous environments such as the
arctic regions. Despite receiving increasing attention, the hydrodynamic
analysis of ASV performance subject to variable operational parameters is
little investigated. In this context, this paper presents a multi-fidelity (MF)
hydrodynamic analysis of an ASV, namely the Shallow Water Autonomous
Multipurpose Platform (SWAMP), at surveying speed in calm water and subject to
variable payload and location of the center of mass, accounting for the variety
of equipment that the vehicle can carry. The analysis is conducted in deep
water, which is the condition mostly encountered by the ASV during surveys of
coastal and harbors areas. Quantities of interest are the resistance, the
vehicle attitude, and the wave generated in the region between the catamaran
hulls. These are assessed using a Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes Equation
(RANSE) code and a linear potential flow (PF) solver. The objective is to
accurately assess the quantities of interest, along with identifying the
limitation of PF analysis in the current context. Finally, a multi-fidelity
Gaussian Process (MF-GP) model is obtained combining RANSE and PF solutions.
The latter also include variable grid refinement and coupling between
hydrodynamic loads and rigid body equations of motion. The surrogate model is
iteratively refined using an active learning approach. Numerical results show
that the MF-GP is effective in producing response surfaces of the SWAMP
performance with a limited computational cost. It is highlighted how the SWAMP
performance is significantly affected not only by the payload, but also by the
location of the center of mass. The latter can be therefore properly calibrated
to minimize the resistance and allow for longer-range operations.

stellar structure and evolution models. This is especially true for binaries
with a fully convective M-dwarf component for which direct measurements of
these stars' masses and radii are difficult using other techniques. Within the
potential of M-dwarfs to be exoplanet host stars, the accuracy of theoretical
predictions of their radius and effective temperature as a function of their
mass is an active topic of discussion. Not only the parameters of transiting
exoplanets but also the success of future atmospheric characterisation rely on
accurate theoretical predictions. We present the analysis of five eclipsing
binaries with low-mass stellar companions out of a sub-sample of 23, for which
we obtained ultra high-precision light curves using the CHEOPS satellite. The
observation of their primary and secondary eclipses are combined with
spectroscopic measurements to precisely model the primary parameters and derive
the M-dwarfs mass, radius, surface gravity, and effective temperature estimates
using the PYCHEOPS data analysis software. Combining these results to the same
set of parameters derived from TESS light curves, we find very good agreement
(better than 1\% for radius and better than 0.2% for surface gravity). We also
analyse the importance of precise orbits from radial velocity measurements and
find them to be crucial to derive M-dwarf radii in a regime below 5% accuracy.
These results add five valuable data points to the mass-radius diagram of
fully-convective M-dwarfs.

Time (FAT) picking, which is an indispensable step in seismic data processing,
and is mainly solved manually in the past. With the current increasing density
of seismic data collection, the efficiency of manual picking has been unable to
meet the actual needs. Therefore, automatic picking methods have been greatly
developed in recent decades, especially those based on deep learning. However,
few of the current supervised deep learning-based method can avoid the
dependence on labeled samples. Besides, since the gather data is a set of
signals which are greatly different from the natural images, it is difficult
for the current method to solve the FAT picking problem in case of a low Signal
to Noise Ratio (SNR). In this paper, for hard rock seismic gather data, we
propose a Multi-Stage Segmentation Pickup Network (MSSPN), which solves the
generalization problem across worksites and the picking problem in the case of
low SNR. In MSSPN, there are four sub-models to simulate the manually picking

seven field datasets with different qualities show that our MSSPN outperforms
benchmarks by a large margin.Particularly, our method can achieve more than

in the next decade. Due to the extremely high sensitivity of these detectors,
the majority of stellar-mass compact-binary mergers in the entire Universe will
be observed. It is also expected that 3G detectors will have significant
sensitivity down to 2-7 Hz; the observed duration of binary neutron star
signals could increase to several hours or days. The abundance and duration of
signals will cause them to overlap in time, which may form a confusion noise
that could affect the detection of individual GW sources when using naive
matched filtering; matched filtering is only optimal for stationary Gaussian
noise. We create mock data for CE and ET using the latest population models
informed by the GWTC-3 catalog and investigate the performance loss of matched
filtering due to overlapping signals. We find the performance loss mainly comes
from a deviation in the noise's measured amplitude spectral density. The
redshift reach of CE (ET) can be reduced by 15%-38% (8%-21%) depending on the
merger rate estimate. The direct contribution of confusion noise to the total
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is generally negligible compared to the
contribution from instrumental noise. We also find that correlated confusion
noise has a negligible effect on the quadrature summation rule of network SNR
for ET, but might reduce the network SNR of high detector-frame mass signals
for detector networks including CE if no mitigation is applied. For ET, the
null stream can mitigate the astrophysical foreground. For CE, we demonstrate
that a computationally efficient, straightforward single-detector signal
subtraction method suppresses the total noise to almost the instrument noise
level; this will allow for near-optimal searches.

the collection of dust in the pressure maxima that arise at the cores of
vortices in protoplanetary discs. The question remains however: as dust
collects in the core of a vortex, when does that vortex remain stable and able
to collect further dust, and when and why does it break up? We study this
question by running high resolution 2D simulations of dust laden vortices. By
using the terminal velocity approximation in a local shearing box it was
possible to efficiently run simulations of back-reacting dust in a gas at high
resolution. Our results show how the stability of 2D dust laden vortices in
protoplanetary discs depends on their size relative to the disc scale height,
as well as the dust coupling. We find small vortices with semiminor axis much
smaller than the scale height to be stable for the duration of the simulations
($t>2000$ orbits). Larger vortices, with semiminor axis smaller than but of
order of the scale height, exhibit a drag instability after undergoing a long
period of contraction where the core becomes progressively more dust rich. The
lifetime of these vortices depends on the dust size, with larger dust grains
causing the instability to occur sooner. For the size ranges tested in this
paper, $\mu$m to mm sized grains, vortices survived for several hundreds of
orbits. The result implies that the stability of vortices formed by vertical
shear instability and zombie vortex instability, or the breakup of larger
vortices through hydrodynamic instabilities, is affected by the presence of
dust in the disc. The lifetimes observed in this paper, while shortened by the
presence of dust for larger vortices, were still long enough to lead to
considerable dust enrichment in the vortex cores.

lower large deviations bounds for the spectral radius $\rho(G_n)$ of $G_n$. A
byproduct of our approach is the local limit theorem for $G_n^{i,j}$ under the
optimal second moment condition. In the proofs we develop a spectral gap theory
for the norm cocycle and for the coefficients, which is of independent
interest.

motor current signature analysis (MCSA) is widely used for fault detection
now-a-days, the proposed hybrid method qualifies as one of the most powerful
online/offline techniques for diagnosing the process faults. Existing
approaches have some drawbacks that can degrade the performance and accuracy of
a process-diagnosis system. In particular, it is very difficult to detect
random stochastic noise due to the nonlinear behavior of valve controller.
Using only Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), frequency leakage and the small
amplitude of the current components related to the fault can be observed, but
the fault due to the controller behavior cannot be observed. Therefore, a
framework of advanced multirate signal and data-processing aided with sensor
fusion algorithms is proposed in this article and satisfactory results are
obtained. For implementing the system, a DSP-based BLDC motor controller with

books to provoke rich thoughts and emotions. To achieve this goal, we propose a
framework for translating raw descriptions with complex semantics into
semantically corresponding images. The main challenge lies in the complexity of
the semantics of raw descriptions, which may be hard to be visualized (e.g.,
""gloomy"" or ""Asian""). It usually poses challenges for existing methods to
handle such descriptions. To address this issue, we propose a Prompt-based
Cross-Modal Generation Framework (PCM-Frame) to leverage two powerful
pre-trained models, including CLIP and StyleGAN. Our framework consists of two
components: a projection module from Text Embeddings to Image Embeddings based
on prompts, and an adapted image generation module built on StyleGAN which
takes Image Embeddings as inputs and is trained by combined semantic
consistency losses. To bridge the gap between realistic images and illustration
designs, we further adopt a stylization model as post-processing in our
framework for better visual effects. Benefiting from the pre-trained models,
our method can handle complex descriptions and does not require external paired
data for training. Furthermore, we have built a benchmark that consists of 200
raw descriptions. We conduct a user study to demonstrate our superiority over
the competing methods with complicated texts. We release our code at

the outbreak traveled faster than the virus. Misinformation spread through
online social networks (OSN) often misled people from following correct medical
practices. In particular, OSN bots have been a primary source of disseminating
false information and initiating cyber propaganda. Existing work neglects the
presence of bots that act as a catalyst in the spread and focuses on fake news
detection in 'articles shared in posts' rather than the post (textual) content.
Most work on misinformation detection uses manually labeled datasets that are
hard to scale for building their predictive models. In this research, we
overcome this challenge of data scarcity by proposing an automated approach for
labeling data using verified fact-checked statements on a Twitter dataset. In
addition, we combine textual features with user-level features (such as
followers count and friends count) and tweet-level features (such as number of
mentions, hashtags and urls in a tweet) to act as additional indicators to
detect misinformation. Moreover, we analyzed the presence of bots in tweets and
show that bots change their behavior over time and are most active during the
misinformation campaign. We collected 10.22 Million COVID-19 related tweets and
used our annotation model to build an extensive and original ground truth
dataset for classification purposes. We utilize various machine learning models
to accurately detect misinformation and our best classification model achieves
precision (82%), recall (96%), and false positive rate (3.58%). Also, our bot
analysis indicates that bots generated approximately 10% of misinformation
tweets. Our methodology results in substantial exposure of false information,

computing, which aims at finding a small subset of users to maximize the
influence spread through online information cascade. Recently, some careful
researchers paid attention to diversity of information dissemination,
especially community-aware diversity, and formulated the diversified IM
problem. The diversity is ubiquitous in a lot of real-world applications, but
they are all based on a given community structure. In social networks, we can
form heterogeneous community structures for the same group of users according
to different metrics. Therefore, how to quantify the diversity based on
multiple community structures is an interesting question. In this paper, we
propose the Composite Community-Aware Diversified IM (CC-DIM) problem, which
aims at selecting a seed set to maximize the influence spread and the composite
diversity over all possible community structures under consideration. To
address the NP-hardness of CC-DIM problem, we adopt the technique of reverse
influence sampling and design a random Generalized Reverse Reachable (G-RR) set
to estimate the objective function. The composition of a random G-RR set is
much more complex than the RR set used for the IM problem, which will lead to
inefficiency of traditional sampling-based approximation algorithms. Because of
this, we further propose a two-stage algorithm, Generalized HIST (G-HIST). It
can not only return a $(1-1/e-\varepsilon)$ approximate solution with at least
$(1-\delta)$ probability, but also improve the efficiency of sampling and ease
the difficulty of searching by significantly reducing the average size of G-RR
sets. Finally, we evaluate our G-HIST on real datasets against existing
algorithms. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed
algorithm and its superiority over other baseline algorithms.

critical field that exceeds Pauli limit. Here we report on muon spin rotation
($\mu$SR) experiments probing the temperature and field dependence of effective
magnetic penetration depth in this compound. Our transverse-field -$\mu$SR
results suggest a fully gaped $s$-wave superconductvity. Further, the estimated
high value of upper critical field is also supplemented by high field transport
measurements. Remarkably, the ratio $T_{\rm c}$/$\lambda^{-2}(0)$ obtained for
NbIr$_2$B$_2$ ($\sim$2) is comparable to those of unconventional
superconductors. Zero-field $\mu$SR data reveals no significant change in the
muon spin relaxation rate above and below $T_{\rm c}$, evincing that
time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the superconducting state. The presented
results will stimulate theoretical investigations to obtain a microscopic
understanding of the origin of superconductivity with preserved time reversal
symmetry in this unique noncentrosymmetric system.

thermodynamic behaviours of a spin-1/2, trilayered ferrimagnetic system on
triangular monolayers with quenched nonmagnetic impurities are studied. Two
different theoretical atoms, A and B, make up the ABA and AAB types of distinct
configurations. Like atoms (A-A and B-B) interact ferromagnetically, while
unlike atoms (A-B) interact antiferromagnetically. Only the A-layers are
randomly site-diluted with dilution percentages ranging from 5% to 45%. Such
diluted magnetic thin systems exhibit magnetic compensation which depends
sensitively on the concentration of impurities. The phase diagram in the
Hamiltonian parameter space related to the occurrence of magnetic compensation
phenomenon and the effect of site dilution is discussed in detail. Special
attention is given to the mathematical dependencies of compensation temperature
on the concentration of nonmagnetic impurities. Depending upon the
concentration of nonmagnetic impurities, the compensation and critical points
shift with the equilibrium magnetic behaviours changing between distinct
ferrimagnetic behaviours. For each combination of the coupling strengths, with
values of the impurity concentration above a threshold, compensation appears
where previously was absent. Suggested mathematical formulae show how threshold
impurity concentration relies on Hamiltonian parameters.

the next generation AO instruments that will equip 30-meter class telescopes,
as the characterization of the PSF will be mandatory to fulfill the planned

developing tools that accurately reconstruct the observed PSF of AO systems,
the so-called PSF reconstruction. In this context, a PSF-R service is a planned

being developed, its implementation is mature enough to test performances with
actual observations. In this presentation we will discuss the reliability of
our reconstructed PSFs and the uncertainties introduced in the measurements of
scientific quantities for bright, on-axis observations taken with the SOUL+LUCI
instrument of the LBT. This is the first application of our algorithm to real
data. It demonstrates its readiness level and paves the way to further testing.
Our PSF-R algorithm is able to reconstruct the SR and full-width at half
maximum of the observed PSFs with errors smaller than 2% and 4.5%,
respectively. We carried out the scientific evaluation of the obtained
reconstructed PSFs thanks to a dedicated set of simulated observations of an

Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) services, such as Uber or DiDi Rider. Such imbalances
are due to uneven stochastic travel demand and can be prevented by proactively
rebalance empty vehicles. To this end we propose a method that include
estimated stochastic travel demand patterns into stochastic model predictive
control (SMPC) for rebalancing of empty vehicles MoD ride-hailing service. More
precisely, we first estimate passenger travel demand using Gaussian Process
Regression (GPR), which provides demand uncertainty bounds for time pattern
prediction. We then formulate a SMPC for the autonomous ride-hailing service
and integrate demand predictions with uncertainty bounds into a receding
horizon MoD optimization. In order to guarantee constraint satisfaction in the
above optimization under estimated stochastic demand prediction, we employ a
probabilistic constraining method with user defined confidence interval.
Receding horizon MoD optimization with probabilistic constraints thereby calls
for Chance Constrained Model Predictive Control (CCMPC). The benefits of the
proposed method are twofold. First, travel demand uncertainty prediction from
data can naturally be embedded into the MoD optimization framework. We show
that for a given minimal fleet size the imbalance in each station can be kept
below a certain threshold with a user defined probability. Second, CCMPC can
further be relaxed into a Mixed-Integer-LP (MILP) and we show that the MILP can
be solved as a corresponding Linear-Program which always admits a integral
solution. Finally, we demonstrate through high-fidelity transportation
simulations, that by tuning the confidence bound on the chance constraint close
to optimal oracle performance can be achieved. The corresponding median
customer wait time is reduced by 4% compared to using only the mean prediction
of the GPR.

Therefore, it is paramount to verify the robustness of the detection under
unexpected hardware faults like soft errors that can impact a systems
perception module. Standard metrics based on average precision produce model
vulnerability estimates at the object level rather than at an image level. As
we show in this paper, this does not provide an intuitive or representative
indicator of the safety-related impact of silent data corruption caused by bit
flips in the underlying memory but can lead to an over- or underestimation of
typical fault-induced hazards. With an eye towards safety-related real-time
applications, we propose a new metric IVMOD (Image-wise Vulnerability Metric
for Object Detection) to quantify vulnerability based on an incorrect
image-wise object detection due to false positive (FPs) or false negative (FNs)
objects, combined with a severity analysis. The evaluation of several
representative object detection models shows that even a single bit flip can
lead to a severe silent data corruption event with potentially critical safety
implications, with e.g., up to (much greater than) 100 FPs generated, or up to
approx. 90% of true positives (TPs) are lost in an image. Furthermore, with a
single stuck-at-1 fault, an entire sequence of images can be affected, causing
temporally persistent ghost detections that can be mistaken for actual objects
(covering up to approx. 83% of the image). Furthermore, actual objects in the
scene are continuously missed (up to approx. 64% of TPs are lost). Our work
establishes a detailed understanding of the safety-related vulnerability of
such critical workloads against hardware faults.

precision. Program analysis techniques for constructing call graphs are
unfortunately usually imprecise. To address this problem, researchers have
recently proposed call graph pruning empowered by machine learning to
post-process call graphs constructed by static analysis. A machine learning
model is built to capture information from the call graph by extracting
structural features for use in a random forest classifier. It then removes
edges that are predicted to be false positives. Despite the improvements shown
by machine learning models, they are still limited as they do not consider the
source code semantics and thus often are not able to effectively distinguish
true and false positives. In this paper, we present a novel call graph pruning
technique, AutoPruner, for eliminating false positives in call graphs via both
statistical semantic and structural analysis. Given a call graph constructed by
traditional static analysis tools, AutoPruner takes a Transformer-based
approach to capture the semantic relationships between the caller and callee
functions associated with each edge in the call graph. To do so, AutoPruner
fine-tunes a model of code that was pre-trained on a large corpus to represent
source code based on descriptions of its semantics. Next, the model is used to
extract semantic features from the functions related to each edge in the call
graph. AutoPruner uses these semantic features together with the structural
features extracted from the call graph to classify each edge via a feed-forward
neural network. Our empirical evaluation on a benchmark dataset of real-world
programs shows that AutoPruner outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines,
improving on F-measure by up to 13% in identifying false-positive edges in a
static call graph.

multipole moments. The possibility of measuring these multipoles in any survey
depends on the level of statistical fluctuations. We present a formalism to
compute the statistical fluctuations in the measurement of bispectrum
multipoles for galaxy surveys. We consider specifications of a {\it Euclid}
like galaxy survey and present two quantities: the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
which quantifies the detectability of a multipole, and the rank correlation
which quantifies the correlation in measurement errors between any two
multipoles. Based on SNR values, we find that {\it Euclid} can potentially
measure the bispectrum multipoles up to $\ell=4$ across various triangle
shapes, formed by the three {\bf k} vectors in Fourier space. In general, SNR
is maximum for the linear triangles. SNR values also depend on the scales and
redshifts of observation. While, $\ell \leq 2$ multipoles can be measured with
${\rm SNR}>5$ even at linear/quasi-linear ($k \lesssim 0.1 \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$)
scales, for $\ell>2$ multipoles, we require to go to small scales or need to
increase bin sizes. For most multipole pairs, the errors are only weakly
correlated across much of the triangle shapes barring a few in the vicinity of
squeezed and stretched triangles. This makes it possible to combine the
measurements of different multipoles to increase the effective SNR.

directly-heated flare models, adopting magnetic field- aligned, plane-parallel
methodologies. With high spatial- and spectral-resolution ground-based optical
observations of flares, it is essential also to understand the response of the
plasma surrounding these strongly heated volumes. We investigate the effects of
the extreme radiation field produced by a heated column of flare plasma on an
adjacent slab of chromospheric plasma, using a two-dimensional radiative
transfer model and considering the time-dependent solution to the atomic level
populations and electron density throughout this model. The outgoing spectra of
H$\alpha$ and Ca II 854.2 nm synthesised from our slab show significant
spatial-, time-, and wavelength-dependent variations (both enhancements and
reductions) in the line cores, extending on order 1 Mm into the non-flaring
slab due to the incident transverse radiation field from the flaring boundary.
This may lead to significant overestimates of the sizes of directly-heated
flare kernels, if line-core observations are used. However, the radiation field
alone is insufficient to drive any significant changes in continuum intensity,
due to the typical photospheric depths at which they forms, so continuum
sources will not have an apparent increase in size. We show that the line
formation regions near the flaring boundary can be driven upwards in altitude
by over 1 Mm despite the primary thermodynamic parameters (other than electron
density) being held horizontally uniform. This work shows that in simple models
these effects are significant and should be considered further in future flare

the rate-distortion (R-D) performance, in which hyperpriors and autoregressive

the latent representations. However, the latent representations still contain
some spatial correlations. In addition, these methods based on the
context-adaptive entropy model cannot be accelerated in the decoding process by
parallel computing devices, e.g. FPGA or GPU. To alleviate these limitations,
we propose a learned multi-resolution image compression framework, which
exploits the recently developed octave convolutions to factorize the latent
representations into the high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) parts,
similar to wavelet transform, which further improves the R-D performance. To
speed up the decoding, our scheme does not use context-adaptive entropy model.
Instead, we exploit an additional hyper layer including hyper encoder and hyper
decoder to further remove the spatial redundancy of the latent representation.
Moreover, the cross-resolution parameter estimation (CRPE) is introduced into
the proposed framework to enhance the flow of information and further improve
the rate-distortion performance. An additional information-fidelity loss is
proposed to the total loss function to adjust the contribution of the LR part
to the final bit stream. Experimental results show that our method separately
reduces the decoding time by approximately 73.35 % and 93.44 % compared with
that of state-of-the-art learned image compression methods, and the R-D

the automated analysis of OCT scans for various diseases such as glaucoma.
However, the current literature lacks an extensive survey on the diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease or cognitive impairment using OCT or OCTA. This has
motivated us to do a comprehensive survey aimed at machine/deep learning
scientists or practitioners who require an introduction to the problem. The
paper contains 1) an introduction to the medical background of Alzheimer's
Disease and Cognitive Impairment and their diagnosis using OCT and OCTA imaging
modalities, 2) a review of various technical proposals for the problem and the
sub-problems from an automated analysis perspective, 3) a systematic review of
the recent deep learning studies and available OCT/OCTA datasets directly aimed
at the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive Impairment. For the
latter, we used Publish or Perish Software to search for the relevant studies
from various sources such as Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science. We followed
the PRISMA approach to screen an initial pool of 3073 references and determined
ten relevant studies (N=10, out of 3073) that directly targeted AD diagnosis.
We identified the lack of open OCT/OCTA datasets (about Alzheimer's disease) as
the main issue that is impeding the progress in the field.

of the possible attack vectors against such systems is still lacking.
Particularly, the automated fact-verification process might be vulnerable to
the exact disinformation campaigns it is trying to combat. In this work, we
assume an adversary that automatically tampers with the online evidence in
order to disrupt the fact-checking model via camouflaging the relevant evidence

spans these two targets and the different threat model dimensions. Guided by
this, we design and propose several potential attack methods. We show that it
is possible to subtly modify claim-salient snippets in the evidence and
generate diverse and claim-aligned evidence. Thus, we highly degrade the
fact-checking performance under many different permutations of the taxonomy's
dimensions. The attacks are also robust against post-hoc modifications of the
claim. Our analysis further hints at potential limitations in models' inference
when faced with contradicting evidence. We emphasize that these attacks can
have harmful implications on the inspectable and human-in-the-loop usage

RAID systems opportunistically leverage higher-than-expected runtime user data
compressibility to enable dynamic RAID level conversion to improve the speed

the large meridional convective cell, predicted by the DNS, is approximated
