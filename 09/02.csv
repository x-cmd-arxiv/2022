paper examines this emerging social imaginary through the phenomenological
concept of dwelling, or being at home in the world, as developed by Martin
Heidegger. To examine in depth one influential articulation of this social

Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta (formerly Facebook). The paper presents a thematic
analysis of Zuckerberg's public statements regarding the metaverse to provide a
close reading of this particular vision. Then, through the lens of Heidegger's

posed by the metaverse social imaginary. This paper explains these threats and
their prognoses, and it closes with some considerations for how the metaverse
could be designed to better facilitate human dwelling.

bounded migration, jobs arrive online one after another and have to be
immediately placed on one of a given set of machines without knowledge about
jobs that may arrive later on. Each job has a size and each machine has a
speed, and the load due to a job assigned to a machine is obtained by dividing
the first value by the second. The goal is to minimize the maximum overall load
any machine receives. However, unlike in the pure online case, each time a new
job arrives it contributes a migration potential equal to the product of its
size and a certain migration factor. This potential can be spend to reassign
jobs either right away (non-amortized case) or at any later time (amortized

several fundamental problems, e.g., load balancing on identical machines and
bin packing, but uniformly related machines have not been considered up to now.
In the present paper, the classical doubling strategy on uniformly related

challenging for transformer-based language models. Therefore, we present MulCo:
Multi-Scale Contrastive Co-Training, a technique for the better fusion of local

to encode local context and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to represent global
document-level syntactic and temporal characteristics. Unlike previous
state-of-the-art methods, which use simple concatenation on multi-view features
or select optimal sentences using sophisticated reinforcement learning
approaches, our model co-trains GNN and BERT modules using a multi-scale
contrastive learning objective. The GNN and BERT modules learn a synergistic
parameterization by contrasting GNN multi-layer multi-hop subgraphs (i.e.,
global context embeddings) and BERT outputs (i.e., local context embeddings)

provides improved ability to fuse local and global contexts encoded using BERT

into a wrong belief about the agent's intention or objective. This paper
studies a class of probabilistic planning problems with intention deception and
investigates how a defender's limited sensing modality can be exploited by an
attacker to achieve its attack objective almost surely (with probability one)
while hiding its intention. In particular, we model the attack planning in a
stochastic system modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). The attacker is
to reach some target states while avoiding unsafe states in the system and
knows that his behavior is monitored by a defender with partial observations.
Given partial state observations for the defender, we develop qualitative
intention deception planning algorithms that construct attack strategies to
play against an action-visible defender and an action-invisible defender,
respectively. The synthesized attack strategy not only ensures the attack
objective is satisfied almost surely but also deceives the defender into
believing that the observed behavior is generated by a normal/legitimate user
and thus failing to detect the presence of an attack. We show the proposed
algorithms are correct and complete and illustrate the deceptive planning
methods with examples.

planning and control algorithms to produce meaningful actions. Therefore, it is
often necessary to consider the interactions between these components when
designing an embodied system. This thesis explores work on the task-driven
co-optimization of robotics systems in an end-to-end manner, simultaneously
optimizing the physical components of the system with inference or control
algorithms directly for task performance. We start by considering the problem
of optimizing a beacon-based localization system directly for localization

develop a deep learning approach to optimize both beacon placement and location

and control parameters directly for task performance by leveraging a
design-conditioned controller capable of generalizing over the space of
physical designs. We then follow this up with an extension to allow for the
optimization over discrete morphological parameters such as the number and
configuration of limbs. Finally, we conclude by exploring the fabrication and

that their holographic dual generically consists of bulk massive gravitons. At
one-loop quantum level, we put forward a holographic formula for the functional
determinant of the higher-derivative conformal operators $P_{2k}^{(2)}$ in
terms of the functional determinant for massive gravitons with standard and
alternate boundary conditions. The analogous construction for vectors
$P_{2k}^{(1)}$ is worked out as well and we also rewrite the holographic
formula for unconstrained vector and traceless symmetric 2-tensor by decoupling
the longitudinal part.
  Finally, we show that the holographic formula provides the necessary building
blocks to address the massless and partially massless bulk gravitons. This is
confirmed in four and six dimensions, verifying full agreement with results
available in the literature.

simulations of the spatial version of the rock-paper-scissors game. Our
outcomes show that the mobility control strategy induces plasticity in the
spatial patterns with groups of organisms of the same species inhabiting
spatial domains whose characteristic length scales depend on the level of
dispersal restrictions. The spatial organisation plasticity allows the
ecosystems to adapt to minimise the individuals' disease contamination risk if
an eventual pathogen alters the disease virulence. We discover that if a
pathogen mutation makes the disease more transmissible or less lethal, the
organisms benefit more if the mobility is not strongly restricted, thus forming
large spatial domains. Conversely, the benefits of protecting against a
pathogen causing a less contagious or deadlier disease are maximised if the
average size of groups of individuals of the same species is significantly
limited, reducing the dimensions of groups of organisms significantly. Our
findings may help biologists understand the effects of dispersal control as a

paper, we investigate the case of a three-dimensional (3D) Z2 gauge theory,
where the excitations take the form of bosonic spinon quasiparticle and vison
flux tubes, with mutual semionic statistics. We focus on an experimentally
relevant intermediate temperature regime, where sparse spinons hop coherently
on a dense quasistatic and stochastic vison background. The effective
Hamiltonian reduces to a random-sign bimodal tight-binding model, where both
the particles and the disorder are borne out of the same underlying quantum
spin liquid (QSL) degrees of freedom, and the coupling between the two is
purely driven by the mutual fractional statistics. We study the localization
properties and observe a mobility edge located close to the band edge, whose
transition belongs to the 3D Anderson model universality class. Spinons allowed
to propagate through the quasistatic vison background appear to display quantum
diffusive behavior. When the visons are allowed to relax, in response to the
presence of spinons in equilibrium, we observe the formation of vison depletion

`classic' shape used in several previous experiments, and a new `wineglass'
geometry. The bandwidth ratio of both optimized OMTs is 2.0:1, defined where
co-polar coupling exceeds 80%. The average co-polar coupling, cross-polar

approximately 93%, $<$-50 dB, 5% and 2%, respectively and depends slightly on
the exact frequency range. The wineglass probe co-polar coupling is $\sim$ 2%

chemical engineering and chemistry. Classical thermodynamic models are
successful in generalizing over (continuous) conditions like temperature and
concentration. On the other hand, matrix completion methods (MCMs) from machine
learning successfully generalize over (discrete) binary systems; these MCMs can
make predictions without any data for a given binary system by implicitly
learning commonalities across systems. In the present work, we combine the
strengths of both worlds in a hybrid approach. The underlying idea is to
predict the pair-interaction energies, as they are used in basically all
physical models of liquid mixtures, by an MCM. As an example, we embed an MCM
into UNIQUAC, a widely-used physical model for the Gibbs excess energy. We
train the resulting hybrid model in a Bayesian machine-learning framework on
experimental data for activity coefficients in binary systems of 1146
components from the Dortmund Data Bank. We thereby obtain, for the first time,
a complete set of UNIQUAC parameters for all binary systems of these
components, which allows us to predict, in principle, activity coefficients at
arbitrary temperature and composition for any combination of these components,
not only for binary but also for multicomponent systems. The hybrid model even
outperforms the best available physical model for predicting activity
coefficients, the modified UNIFAC (Dortmund) model.

correlations across the entire input sequence. Despite favorable performance,
calculating pairwise correlations is prohibitively costly. While recent work
has shown the benefits of runtime pruning of elements with low attention
scores, the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms and their on-chip
memory capacity demands are overlooked. This work addresses these constraints
by architecting an accelerator, called SPRINT, which leverages the inherent
parallelism of ReRAM crossbar arrays to compute attention scores in an
approximate manner. Our design prunes the low attention scores using a
lightweight analog thresholding circuitry within ReRAM, enabling SPRINT to
fetch only a small subset of relevant data to on-chip memory. To mitigate
potential negative repercussions for model accuracy, SPRINT re-computes the
attention scores for the few fetched data in digital. The combined in-memory
pruning and on-chip recompute of the relevant attention scores enables SPRINT
to transform quadratic complexity to a merely linear one. In addition, we
identify and leverage a dynamic spatial locality between the adjacent attention
operations even after pruning, which eliminates costly yet redundant data
fetches. We evaluate our proposed technique on a wide range of state-of-the-art
transformer models. On average, SPRINT yields 7.5x speedup and 19.6x energy
reduction when total 16KB on-chip memory is used, while virtually on par with
iso-accuracy of the baseline models (on average 0.36% degradation).

computational physics and chemistry communities is the so-called sampling
problem or rare event problem where proper sampling of energy landscapes is
impeded by the presences of high kinetic barriers that hinder transitions
between metastable states on typical simulation time scales. Many enhanced
sampling methods have been developed to address this sampling problem and more
efficiently sample rare event systems. An interesting idea, coming from the
field of statistics, was introduced in a recent work (Y. Lu, J. Lu, and J.
Nolen, arXiv:1905.09863, 2019) in the form of a novel sampling algorithm that
augments overdamped Langevin dynamics with a birth-death process. In this work,
we expand on this idea and show that this birth-death sampling scheme can
efficiently sample prototypical rare event energy landscapes, and that the
speed of equilibration is independent of the barrier height. We amend a crucial
shortcoming of the original algorithm that leads to incorrect sampling of
barrier regions by introducing a new approximation of the birth-death term. We
establish important theoretical properties of the modified algorithm and prove
mathematically that the relevant convergence results still hold. We investigate
via numerical simulations the effect of various parameters, and we investigate
ways to reduce the computational effort of the sampling scheme. We show that
the birth-death mechanism can be used to accelerate sampling in the more
general case of underdamped Langevin dynamics that is more commonly used in
simulating physical systems. Our results show that this birth-death scheme is a
promising method for sampling rare event energy landscapes.

research interest in recent three years. Most existing HGNNs fall into two
classes. One class is meta-path-based HGNNs which either require domain
knowledge to handcraft meta-paths or consume huge amount of time and memory to
automatically construct meta-paths. The other class does not rely on meta-path
construction. It takes homogeneous convolutional graph neural networks
(Conv-GNNs) as backbones and extend them to heterogeneous graphs by introducing
node-type- and edge-type-dependent parameters. Regardless of the meta-path
dependency, most existing HGNNs employ shallow Conv-GNNs such as GCN and GAT to
aggregate neighborhood information, and may have limited capability to capture
information from high-order neighborhood. In this work, we propose two
heterogeneous graph tree network models: Heterogeneous Graph Tree Convolutional

They report a frequent positive correlation and some surprisingly never even

possibility of inverse patterns is important to determine whether ID
performance can serve as a proxy for OOD generalization capabilities.
  This paper shows with multiple datasets that inverse correlations between ID

worst-case settings. We also explain theoretically how these cases can arise
even in a minimal linear setting, and why past studies could miss such cases
due to a biased selection of models.
  Our observations lead to recommendations that contradict those found in much
of the current literature. - High OOD performance sometimes requires trading
off ID performance. - Focusing on ID performance alone may not lead to optimal
OOD performance. It may produce diminishing (eventually negative) returns in
OOD performance. - In these cases, studies on OOD generalization that use ID
performance for model selection (a common recommended practice) will
necessarily miss the best-performing models, making these studies blind to a

As a side effect, this new data distribution implies that existing models need

prevent the inference of sensitive attributes. More precisely, we leverage on

protection against attribute inference. Our proposed approach, preserves the
interpretability of data and can be used without defining exactly the sensitive

generalisability of 3D human pose estimation (HPE) models. All unsupervised
2D-3D HPE approaches provide the entire 2D kinematic skeleton to a model during
training. We argue that this is sub-optimal and disruptive as long-range
correlations are induced between independent 2D key points and predicted 3D
ordinates during training. To this end, we conduct the following study. With a
maximum architecture capacity of 6 residual blocks, we evaluate the performance
of 5 models which each represent a 2D pose differently during the adversarial
unsupervised 2D-3D HPE process. Additionally, we show the correlations between
2D key points which are learned during the training process, highlighting the
unintuitive correlations induced when an entire 2D pose is provided to a
lifting model. Our results show that the most optimal representation of a 2D
pose is that of two independent segments, the torso and legs, with no shared
features between each lifting network. This approach decreased the average
error by 20\% on the Human3.6M dataset when compared to a model with a near
identical parameter count trained on the entire 2D kinematic skeleton.
Furthermore, due to the complex nature of adversarial learning, we show how
this representation can also improve convergence during training allowing for
an optimum result to be obtained more often.

unnecessary to compute rapidities at all. The RDM elements require numerically
inverting a matrix and while this is usually undesirable we demonstrate that it
is stable, except when there is degeneracy in the single-particle energies. In
such cases a different construction would be required.

a separate alignment decoder for an implicit duration prediction. Finally, we
extend our framework to the timestamp supervised setting via our proposed
constrained k-medoids algorithm to generate pseudo-segmentations. Our proposed

that bubbles expand with uniform proper acceleration. We show that this

the spectrum of fluctuations for the energy functional in the reference frame
in which the uniformly accelerating bubble wall appears static. In such a
frame, arbitrary small perturbations cause an amplifying departure from the
static wall solution. This implies that the nucleated bubble is not a critical
point of the energy functional in the rest frame of nucleation but becomes one
in the accelerating frame. The aforementioned instability for vacuum bubbles
can be related to the well-known instability for the nucleated critical static
bubbles during finite-temperature phase transitions in the rest frame of the
plasma. It is therefore proposed that zero-temperature vacuum decays as seen
from accelerating frames have a dual description in terms of finite-temperature
phase transitions.

test the Kerr nature of black holes. The strongest such test, with minimal
additional assumptions, is provided by observations of multiple ringdown modes,
also known as black hole spectroscopy. For the gravitational wave merger event
GW190521, we have previously claimed the detection of two ringdown modes
emitted by the remnant black hole. In this paper we provide further evidence
for the detection of multiple ringdown modes from this event. We analyse the
recovery of simulated gravitational wave signals designed to replicate the
ringdown properties of GW190521. We quantify how often our detection statistic
reports strong evidence for a sub-dominant $(\ell,m,n)=(3,3,0)$ ringdown mode,
even when no such mode is present in the simulated signal. We find this only
occurs with a probability $\sim 0.02$, which is consistent with a Bayes factor
of $56\pm1$ (1$\sigma$ uncertainty) found for GW190521. We also quantify our
agnostic analysis of GW190521, in which no relationship is assumed between
ringdown modes, and find that only 1 in 250 simulated signals without a
$(3,3,0)$ mode yields a result as significant as GW190521. Conversely, we
verify that when simulated signals do have an observable $(3,3,0)$ mode they
consistently yield a strong evidence and significant agnostic results. We also
find that simulated GW190521-like signals with a $(3,3,0)$ mode present yield
tight constraints on deviations of that mode from Kerr, whereas constraints on
the $(2,2,1)$ overtone of the dominant mode yield wide constraints that are not
consistent with Kerr. These results on simulated signals are similar to what we
find for GW190521. Our results strongly support our previous conclusion that
the gravitational wave signal from GW190521 contains an observable sub-dominant
$(\ell,m,n)=(3,3,0)$ mode.

with videos that are recorded in the wild as opposed to within laboratory

many features of the desired target speech, like voice, pitch and linguistic
content, cannot be entirely inferred from the silent face video. In order to

learns to associate the lip and speech sequences amidst the variations. With
the help of multiple powerful discriminators that guide the training process,
our generator learns to synthesize speech sequences in any voice for the lip
movements of any person. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that
we outperform all baselines by a large margin. Further, our network can be
fine-tuned on videos of specific identities to achieve a performance comparable

numerous ablation studies to analyze the effect of different modules of our

collision and fusion of particles. During the collision stage, the two

  with Graph Kernel Infomax",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Learning Electronic Health Records (EHRs) representation is a preeminent yet
under-discovered research topic. It benefits various clinical decision support
applications, e.g., medication outcome prediction or patient similarity search.
Current approaches focus on task-specific label supervision on vectorized
sequential EHR, which is not applicable to large-scale unsupervised scenarios.
Recently, contrastive learning shows great success on self-supervised
representation learning problems. However, complex temporality often degrades
the performance. We propose Graph Kernel Infomax, a self-supervised graph
kernel learning approach on the graphical representation of EHR, to overcome
the previous problems. Unlike the state-of-the-art, we do not change the graph
structure to construct augmented views. Instead, we use Kernel Subspace
Augmentation to embed nodes into two geometrically different manifold views.
The entire framework is trained by contrasting nodes and graph representations
on those two manifold views through the commonly used contrastive objectives.
Empirically, using publicly available benchmark EHR datasets, our approach
yields performance on clinical downstream tasks that exceeds the
state-of-the-art. Theoretically, the variation on distance metrics naturally
creates different views as data augmentation without changing graph structures.

with next generation integral field spectrometers, and thanks to the
availability of a large suite of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations --
the CAMELS suite -- we study here in detail the emission properties of the WHIM
and the possibility to infer its physical properties with upcoming X-ray
missions like Athena. We focused on the two most prominent WHIM emission lines,
the OVII triplet and the OVIII singlet, and build line surface brightness maps
in a lightcone, mimicking a data cube generated through integral field
spectroscopy. We confirm that detectable WHIM emission, even with next
generation instruments, is largely associated to galaxy-size dark matter halos
and that the WHIM properties evolve little from $z\simeq0.5$ to now. Some
characteristics of the WHIM, like the line number counts as a function of their
brightness, depend on the specific hydrodynamic simulation used, while others,
like the WHIM clustering properties, are robust to this aspect. The large
number of simulations available in the CAMELS datasets allows us to assess the
sensitivity of the WHIM properties to the background cosmology and to the

using different empirical and theoretical relations to convert the total

compare it with available observations. The CO and [CII] luminosity functions
presented here are well in agreement with all the available observations. In

luminosity directly from the star formation rate, but considering a dependence
of this relation on the gas metallicity. For all the CO luminosity functions,
the estimates favoured by the data are derived considering different relations,
depending on the ionisation mechanism dominating each galaxy, i.e. star
formation or active galactic nuclei, and, moreover, deriving the $J\geq4$ CO
lines directly from the [CII] luminosity. However, further data are necessary

model on the triangular lattice for intermediate temperatures $t \lesssim T <

the fitting protocols used in the experiment, we recover the observed trends in
the reported Curie-Weiss temperature $\Theta$ with filling, using the reported
interaction strength $U/t=20$. We focus on the large increase of $|\Theta|$ on
decreasing the density below half filling and the sign change of $\Theta$ at
higher fillings, which signals the onset of ferromagnetism. The increase in
$|\Theta|$ is also seen in the $t$-$J$ model (the low energy limit of the
Hubbard model) in the intermediate temperature range, which we clarify is
opposite to the trend in its high temperature limit. Differences between the
low, intermediate and high temperature regimes are discussed. Our numerical
calculations also capture the crossover between short-range antiferromagnetic
to ferromagnetic order in the intermediate temperature regime, a result broadly
consistent with the experimental findings. We find that this behavior is a
finite-temperature remnant of the underlying zero temperature phase transition,

radiative feedback, and energy budget of their host environments. Yet how
massive stars initially form and how they evolve throughout their lives is
ambiguous. The mass loss of the most massive stars remains a key unknown in
stellar physics, with consequences for stellar feedback and populations. In
this work, we compare grids of very massive star (VMS) models with masses
ranging from 80-1000Msun, for a range of input physics. We include enhanced
winds close to the Eddington limit as a comparison to standard O-star winds,
with consequences for present-day observations of ~50-100Msun stars. We probe
the relevant surface H abundances (Xs) to determine the key traits of VMS
evolution compared to O stars. We find fundamental differences in the behaviour
of our models with the enhanced-wind prescription, with a convergence on the
stellar mass at 1.6 Myr, regardless of the initial mass. It turns out that Xs
is an important tool in deciphering the initial mass due to the chemically
homogeneous nature of VMS above a mass threshold. We use Xs to break the
degeneracy of the initial masses of both components of a detached binary, and a
sample of WNh stars in the Tarantula nebula. We find that for some objects, the
initial masses are unrestricted and, as such, even initial masses of the order
1000Msun are not excluded. Coupled with the mass turnover at 1.6 Myr, Xs can be

us to detect any previously unseen triple systems in our list of binaries. We
present the orbits of 12 companions around early F to B-type binaries, 9 of

0.45-1.3 solar masses. Our orbits constrain these systems to a high astrometric

masses of individual components in some cases. Although additional RV
measurements are needed to break degeneracy in the mutual inclination, we find
that the majority of these inner triples are not well-aligned with the wide

where $G$ is the UV symmetry and $K$ is generated by
$\mathfrak{k}=\mathfrak{h}_1\cap \mathfrak{h}_2$, and $\mathfrak{h}_i$ is the
Lie algebra of the unbroken symmetry in each SSB phase. With this specific
target space, the symmetry defects in both SSB phases are on equal footing, and
their intertwinement is captured by the WZW term. The DQCP transition is then
tuned by proliferating the symmetry defects. By coupling the $G/K$ NLSM with
the WZW term to the background gauge field, the 't Hooft anomaly of this theory

all the relevant challenges, without relying on any a-priori knowledge on the
system. To overcome this need, a neural network is trained directly on
experimental data to learn the multiparameter Bayesian update. Then, the system
is set at its optimal working point through feedbacks provided by a
reinforcement learning algorithm trained to reconstruct and enhance experiment
heuristics of the investigated quantum sensor. Notably, we prove experimentally
the achievement of higher estimation performances than standard methods,
demonstrating the strength of the combination of these two black-box algorithms
on an integrated photonic circuit. This work represents an important step
towards fully artificial intelligence-based quantum metrology.

other operators can be removed by field redefinitions or start at higher-order

the final boundary correlators take a very compact form. For operators
quadratic in the extrinsic curvature, the leading order bispectra are a sum of
contact and single exchange diagrams, which are tied together by spatial
diffeomorphisms, and to all orders in derivatives we derive these bispectra by
computing the necessary bulk time integrals. For single exchange diagrams we
exploit factorisation properties of the bulk-bulk propagator for massless

surprisingly, we show these single exchange contributions have only
total-energy poles and also satisfy the MLT.

a radio monitoring campaign of A0620-00, one of the best-studied and
least-luminous known quiescent black hole X-ray binaries. We observed A0620-00
at 9.8 GHz using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array on 31 epochs from 2017 to
2020, detecting the source ~75% of the time. We see significant variability
over all timescales sampled, and the observed flux densities follow a lognormal
distribution with a mean of 12.5 uJy and standard deviation of 0.22 dex. In no
epoch was A0620-00 as bright as in 2005 (51 +/- 7 uJy), implying either that
this original detection was obtained during an unusually bright flare, or that
the system is fading in the radio over time. We present tentative evidence that
the quiescent radio emission from A0620-00 is less variable than that of V404
Cyg, the only other black hole binary with comparable data. Given that V404 Cyg

extend desirability to the nonlinear case by letting the utility scale be
represented via a general closure operator. The new theory directly expresses
rewards in actual nonlinear currency (money), much in Savage's spirit, while
arguably weakening the founding assumptions to a minimum. We characterise the

numbers, but also a possible UV completion into which this $U(1)_D$ and the SM

attempted to construct a more unified framework of these SM and dark sector
interactions. In this paper we will instead begin to explore, from the
top-down, the possibility of the unification of these forces via the
decomposition of a GUT-like group, $G\to G_{SM}\times G_{Dark}$, where $U(1)_D$

study it will be assumed that $G=SU(N)$ with $N=6-10$. Although not our main
goal, models that also unify the three SM generational structure within this
same general framework will also be examined. The possibilities are found to be
quite highly constrained by our chosen set of model building requirements which
are likely too strong when they are employed simultaneously to obtain a
successful model framework.

Our starting point is the existence of multiple overlooked structural
similarities between human intelligence benchmarks and ML benchmarks. Both
types of benchmarks set standards for describing, evaluating, and comparing
performance on tasks relevant to intelligence -- standards that many scholars
of human intelligence have long recognized as value-laden. We use perspectives
from feminist philosophy of science on IQ benchmarks and thick concepts in
social science to argue that values need to be considered and documented when
creating ML benchmarks. It is neither possible nor desirable to avoid this

applications built over p2p networks and incentivized through blockchain are
becoming popular. A key characteristic of these networks is their openness:
anyone can host a media server on the network and gain reward for providing
service. Strong economic incentives combined with lower entry barrier to join
the network, makes increasing server coverage to even remote regions of the

this paper, we consider the problem of multicast tree construction for video

is motivated by the combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem and uses a

DecVi achieves similar quality-of-experience compared to a centralized globally

  We show how four-dimensional momentum-space is emergent in this picture,
which connects directly to the so-called kinematic algebra of the tree-level

CFT to make contact with holographic symmetry algebras previously observed in
the soft expansion. Kac-Moody currents play the role of a graviton to all

diverse image distributions. However, despite its impressive applications, the
structure of the latent space in GANs largely remains as a black-box, leaving
its controllable generation an open problem, especially when spurious
correlations between different semantic attributes exist in the image
distributions. To address this problem, previous methods typically learn linear
directions or individual channels that control semantic attributes in the image
space. However, they often suffer from imperfect disentanglement, or are unable
to obtain multi-directional controls. In this work, in light of the above
challenges, we propose a novel approach that discovers nonlinear controls,
which enables multi-directional manipulation as well as effective
disentanglement, based on gradient information in the learned GAN latent space.
More specifically, we first learn interpolation directions by following the
gradients from classification networks trained separately on the attributes,
and then navigate the latent space by exclusively controlling channels
activated for the target attribute in the learned directions. Empirically, with
small training data, our approach is able to gain fine-grained controls over a
diverse set of bi-directional and multi-directional attributes, and we showcase
its ability to achieve disentanglement significantly better than
state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

qualities, the ability of simulations to reproduce the small mass of Mars
within the planets' geochemically inferred accretion timescale of <10 Myr after
the appearance of calcium aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) is arguably
considered the gold standard for judging evolutionary hypotheses. At present, a
number of independent models are capable of consistently generating Mars-like
planets and simultaneously satisfying various important observational and
geochemical constraints. However, all models must still account for the effects
of the epoch of giant planet migration and orbital instability; an event which
dynamical and cosmochemical constraints indicate occurred within the first 100
Myr after nebular gas dispersal. If the instability occurred in the first few
Myr of this window, the disturbance might have affected the bulk of Mars'
growth. In this manuscript, we turn our attention to a scenario where the
instability took place after t=50 Myr. Specifically, we simulate the
instability's effects on three nearly-assembled terrestrial systems that were
generated via previous embryo accretion models and contain three large
proto-planets with orbits interior to a collection of ~Mars-mass embryos and
debris. While the instability consistently triggers a Moon-forming impact and
efficiently removes excessive material from the Mars-region in our models, we
find that our final systems are too dynamically excited and devoid of Mars and
Mercury analogs. Thus, we conclude that, while possible, our scenario is far
more improbable than one where the instability either occurred earlier, or at a
time where Earth and Venus' orbits were far less dynamically excited.

VRES power forecasts that mostly rely on historical forecast and actual VRES

shown that rarefaction waves generated by the flame during the deceleration
stage play a key role in the tulip-shaped flame formation. The interaction of

To model the situation observed in large-scale data centers, we introduce the
Online Demand Scheduling with Failover problem. There are $m$ identical devices
with capacity constraints. Demands come one-by-one and, to be robust against a
device failure, need to be assigned to a pair of devices. When a device fails
(in a failover scenario), each demand assigned to it is rerouted to its paired
device (which may now run at increased capacity). The goal is to assign demands
to the devices to maximize the total utilization subject to both the normal
capacity constraints as well as these novel failover constraints. These latter
constraints introduce new decision tradeoffs not present in classic assignment
problems such as the Multiple Knapsack problem and AdWords.

circumvent this constant-factor loss, which in the context of big cloud

this model we design an algorithm that achieves a sub-linear additive regret

$1$). This requires a combination of different techniques, including a

  with finite difference operators",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Acoustic and elastic wave equations are routinely used in geophysical and
engineering studies to simulate the propagation of waves, with a broad range of
applications, including seismology, near surface characterization,
non-destructive structural evaluation, etc. Finite difference methods remain
popular choices for these simulations due to their simplicity and efficiency.
In particular, the family of finite difference methods based on the
summation-by-parts operators and the simultaneous-approximation-terms technique
have been proposed for these simulations, which offers great flexibility in
addressing boundary and interface conditions. For the applications mentioned
above, surface of the earth is usually associated with the free surface
boundary condition. In this study, we demonstrate that the weakly imposed free
surface boundary condition through the simultaneous-approximation-terms
technique can have issue when the source terms, which introduces abrupt
disturbances to the wave field, are placed too close to the surface. In
response, we propose to build the free surface boundary condition into the
summation-by-parts finite difference operators and hence strongly and
automatically impose the free surface boundary condition to address this issue.
The procedure is very simple for acoustic wave equation, requiring resetting a
few rows and columns in the existing difference operators only. For the elastic
wave equation, the procedure is more involved and requires special design of
the grid layout and summation-by-parts operators that satisfy additional
requirements, as revealed by the discrete energy analysis. In both cases, the
energy conserving property is preserved. Numerical examples are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

our society. Aspects relating to reliance on the networking domain and the
difficulty of achieving security by design pose a challenge today. As a result,
data-centric and machine-learning approaches arose as feasible solutions for
securing large networks. Although, in the network security domain, ML-based
solutions face a challenge regarding the capability to generalize between
different contexts. In other words, solutions based on specific network data
usually do not perform satisfactorily on other networks. This paper describes
the stacked-unsupervised federated learning (FL) approach to generalize on a
cross-silo configuration for a flow-based network intrusion detection system
(NIDS). The proposed approach we have examined comprises a deep autoencoder in
conjunction with an energy flow classifier in an ensemble learning task. Our
approach performs better than traditional local learning and naive
cross-evaluation (training in one context and testing on another network data).
Remarkably, the proposed approach demonstrates a sound performance in the case
of non-iid data silos. In conjunction with an informative feature in an
ensemble architecture for unsupervised learning, we advise that the proposed
FL-based NIDS results in a feasible approach for generalization between
heterogeneous networks. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first
successful approach to applying unsupervised FL on the problem of network
intrusion detection generalization using flow-based data.

process of selecting the most likely signal model from several candidates.
While classic methods fail at MOE in the presence of coherent multipath
interference, data-driven supervised learning models can solve this problem.
Instead of the classic MLP (Multiple Layer Perceptions) or CNN (Convolutional
Neural Networks) architectures, we propose the application of Residual
Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN), with grouped symmetric kernel filters to
deliver state-of-art estimation accuracy of up to 95.2\% in the presence of
coherent multipath, and a weighted loss function to eliminate underestimation
error of the model order. We show the benefit of the approach by demonstrating

association of each of the paths with those sources . Moreover, we show that
the proposed estimator provides accurate performance over a variety of array

communication with humans across different contexts. One particular use case
for these technologies is conversational agents, which output natural language
text in response to prompts and queries. This mode of engagement raises a
number of social and ethical questions. For example, what does it mean to align
conversational agents with human norms or values? Which norms or values should
they be aligned with? And how can this be accomplished? In this paper, we
propose a number of steps that help answer these questions. We start by
developing a philosophical analysis of the building blocks of linguistic
communication between conversational agents and human interlocutors. We then
use this analysis to identify and formulate ideal norms of conversation that
can govern successful linguistic communication between humans and
conversational agents. Furthermore, we explore how these norms can be used to
align conversational agents with human values across a range of different

intracluster-medium are commonly multiphase, which poses the question of the
structure of these systems. While there are many known processes leading to
fragmentation of cold gas embedded in a (turbulent) hot medium, in this work,
we focus on the reverse process: coagulation. This is often seen in wind-tunnel
and shearing layer simulations, where cold gas fragments spontaneously
coalesce. Using 2D and 3D hydrodynamical simulations, we find that sufficiently
large ($\gg c_{\rm s} t_{\rm cool}$), perturbed cold gas clouds develop
overstable sound waves which ensure cold gas mass growth over an extended
period of time ($\gg r / c_{\rm s}$). This mass growth efficiently accelerates
hot gas which in turn can entrain cold droplets, leading to coagulation. The
attractive inverse square force between cold gas droplets has interesting
parallels with gravity; the `monopole' is surface area rather than mass. We
develop a simple analytic model which reproduces our numerical findings.

to account for the heavy modulation of the emission, the possible covariance of
the Stokes parameters, and the observed asymmetries in the distributions of
total intensity, polarization, and fractional polarization by treating the
intensities of the orthogonal polarization modes as exponential random
variables. The model is used to derive theoretical distributions to compare
with what is observed. The resulting distributions are unimodal and generally
asymmetric. The unimodality arises from the model's fundamental assumption that
the orthogonal modes are superposed. The asymmetry originates primarily from
different fluctuations in mode intensities. The distributions of fractional
polarization are truncated at the degree of linear and circular polarization
intrinsic to the modes. A number of observable parameters that quantify the
statistical properties of the emission and its polarization are derived and are
shown to be functions only of the ratio of the modes' mean intensities, M,
suggesting their spectra coevolve according to the frequency dependence of M.
This particular implementation of the model requires the modes to fluctuate
differently in order to replicate the observations. Since a single underlying
emission mechanism seems unlikely to selectively modulate the mode intensities,
the different fluctuations are attributed either to different emission
mechanisms for the modes or to mode-dependent propagation or scattering effects
in the pulsar magnetosphere.

under levitating microflyers, including the chamber floor or the launchpad from

launchpad composed of three J-shaped (candy-cane-like) wires that minimized a
microflyer's extraneous interactions with underlying surfaces. We compared our
new launchpads to previously used wire-mesh launchpads for simple levitating
mylar-based disks with diameters of 2, 4, and 8 cm. Importantly, wire-mesh
launchpads increased the photophoretic lift force by up to sixfold. A
significant ground effect was also associated with the bottom of the vacuum
chamber, particularly when the distance to the bottom surface was less than the
diameter of the levitating disk. We provide guidelines to minimize the ground

Aims. We aim to examine the space weathering timescale on a near-Earth S-type

evolutional process of the asteroid. Methods. We focused on bright mottles on
the boulder surfaces generated via impacts with interplanetary dust particles
(IDPs). We compared the bright mottle size distribution with an IDP flux model
to determine the space weathering timescale. Results. As a result, we found
that the space weathering timescale on Itokawa's boulder surfaces is 10$^3$

timescale of space weathering by light ions from the solar wind. Conclusions.
From this result, we conclude that Itokawa's surface has been weathered shortly

(BFT) consensus, the state-of-the-art designs still suffer from suboptimal
performance. Particularly, to obtain maximum throughput, most existing
protocols with guaranteed linear amortized communication complexity require
each participating node to broadcast a huge batch of transactions, which
dramatically sacrifices latency. Worse still, the f slowest nodes' broadcasts
might never be agreed to output and thus can be censored (where f is the number
of faults). Implementable mitigation to the threat either uses computationally
costly threshold encryption or incurs communication blow-up, thus causing
further efficiency issues.
  We present Dumbo-NG, a novel asynchronous BFT consensus (atomic broadcast) to
solve the remaining practical issues. Its technical core is a non-trivial
direct reduction from asynchronous atomic broadcast to multi-valued validated
Byzantine agreement (MVBA) with quality property. Most interestingly, the new
protocol structure empowers completely concurrent execution of transaction
dissemination and asynchronous agreement. This brings about two benefits: (i)
the throughput-latency tension is resolved to approach peak throughput with
minimal increase in latency; (ii) the transactions broadcasted by any honest
node can be agreed to output, thus conquering the censorship threat with no
extra cost.
  We implement Dumbo-NG and compare it to the state-of-the-art asynchronous BFT
with guaranteed censorship resilience including Dumbo (CCS'20) and
Speeding-Dumbo (NDSS'22). We also apply the techniques from Speeding-Dumbo to
DispersedLedger (NSDI'22) and obtain an improved variant of DispersedLedger

Dumbo-NG realizes better peak throughput performance and its latency can almost
remain stable when throughput grows.

making it difficult to trace the measurement result back to a specific value of
the physical property in the system. It is therefore possible that the outcomes
of quantum measurements depend in a non-trivial manner on the dynamics of the
measurement interaction, possibly providing a physical explanation for the role
of measurement contexts in quantum mechanics. Here, we show that the effects of
the measurement interaction on the meter can be described entirely in terms of
the quantum coherent system dynamics associated with the back-action on the
system. For sufficiently small back-action uncertainties, the physical property
of the system is described by a weak value obtained from the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation of the back-action dynamics. At higher measurement resolutions, the
observed values are determined by quantum interferences between different
amounts of back-action. Eigenvalues emerge when the quantum interferences
between different back-actions correspond to a Fourier transform in the
back-action parameter. We conclude that the values of physical properties
obtained in quantum measurements originate from the quantum coherent properties
of the back-action dynamics generated by that physical property during an
interaction. Measurement outcomes represent elements of the dynamics and cannot
be explained by measurement independent elements of reality.

phases (also called 'complexions') that can undergo interfacial phase-like
transitions. As bulk phase diagrams and calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD)
methods are a foundation for modern materials science, we propose to extend
them to GBs to have equally significant impacts. This perspective article
reviews a series of studies to compute the GB counterparts to bulk phase
diagrams. First, a phenomenological interfacial thermodynamic model was
developed to construct GB lambda diagrams to forecast high-temperature GB
disordering and related trends in sintering and other properties for both
metallic and ceramic materials. In parallel, an Ising-type lattice statistical
thermodynamic model was utilized to construct GB adsorption diagrams, which
predicted first-order GB adsorption (a.k.a. segregation) transitions and
critical phenomena. These two simplified thermodynamic models emphasize on the
GB structural (disordering) and chemical (adsorption) aspects, respectively.
Subsequently, hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics atomistic simulations
were used to compute more rigorous and accurate GB 'phase' diagrams. Computed
GB diagrams of thermodynamic and structural properties were further extended to
include mechanical properties. Moreover, machine learning was combined with
atomistic simulations to predict GB properties as functions of four independent
compositional variables and temperature in a 5-D space for a given GB in
high-entropy alloys or as functions of five GB macroscopic (crystallographic)
degrees of freedom (DOFs) plus temperature and composition for a binary alloy
in a 7-D space. Relevant other studies are examined. Future perspective and
outlook, including two emerging fields of high-entropy grain boundaries (HEGBs)
and electrically (or electrochemically) induced GB transitions, are discussed.

focused on mode-locking the spectral modes of lasers, relatively little

mode-locking presents ample opportunities to develop new technologies and to
study the intersection of nonlinear, non-Hermitian, and topological phenomena,
which, in recent years, has been a priority for the field of topological
physics. Here, we theoretically predict and experimentally realize topological
temporal mode-locking in a laser cavity with time-delayed intracavity
couplings. These couplings introduce non-Hermitian point-gap topology into the
temporal modes of our laser and conspire with an effective nonlocal
nonlinearity to generate mode-locked temporal structures in our laser cavity,
whose form can be tailored by suitably engineering the underlying couplings. We
harness this approach to realize a nonlinearity-driven non-Hermitian skin
effect, and we show that the topological temporal modes of our laser are robust
against disorder-induced localization. The flexibility and programmability of
our topological temporal mode-locking scheme reveals new opportunities to study
nonlinear and non-Hermitian topological phenomena in mode-locked photonic

the Hebeler-Lattimer-Pethick-Schwenk (HLPS) intermediate equation of state

hybrid EoS is located in the range that is defined by the low-density chiral
effective theory, the high-density perturbative QCD, and the polytropic
interpolations between them, and is constrained by the astrophysics
observations. The square of the sound velocity reaches a maximum value larger
than $0.8$ in the region of $2-5$ times the saturation baryon number density

mass-radius relation and the tidal deformability of the neutron stars are in

total entropy contributed by the black hole outer horizon and the cosmological
horizon. For smooth configurations, the Euclidean action can be interpreted as
the black hole production rate in de Sitter space. We show that the
4-derivative couplings break the symmetry between the production rate of the
purely electric black hole and that of the purely magnetic black hole. Although
electromagnetic duality is no longer a symmetry, it induces a transformation on
the 4-derivative couplings, mapping the physical quantities of a purely
electric black hole to those of a purely magnetic black hole and vice versa. We
also observe that under the same transformation, unitarity constraints on the
4-derivative couplings remain invariant.

(RNFL) thickness map are crucial for detecting and monitoring ophthalmic
diseases (e.g., glaucoma). For computer-aided diagnosis of eye diseases, the
key technique is to automatically extract meaningful features from ophthalmic
images that can reveal the biomarkers (e.g., RNFL thinning patterns) linked to
functional vision loss. However, representation learning from ophthalmic images
that links structural retinal damage with human vision loss is non-trivial
mostly due to large anatomical variations between patients. The task becomes
even more challenging in the presence of image artifacts, which are common due
to issues with image acquisition and automated segmentation. In this paper, we
propose an artifact-tolerant unsupervised learning framework termed EyeLearn
for learning representations of ophthalmic images. EyeLearn has an artifact
correction module to learn representations that can best predict artifact-free
ophthalmic images. In addition, EyeLearn adopts a clustering-guided contrastive
learning strategy to explicitly capture the intra- and inter-image affinities.
During training, images are dynamically organized in clusters to form
contrastive samples in which images in the same or different clusters are
encouraged to learn similar or dissimilar representations, respectively. To
evaluate EyeLearn, we use the learned representations for visual field
prediction and glaucoma detection using a real-world ophthalmic image dataset
of glaucoma patients. Extensive experiments and comparisons with
state-of-the-art methods verified the effectiveness of EyeLearn for learning
optimal feature representations from ophthalmic images.

self-adaptation, the balance between diversification and intensification, and

sensitivities are instrumental in managing index funds. An index fund is a
mutual fund aiming to track the returns of a predefined market index (e.g., the
S&P 500). A basic strategy to manage an index fund is replicating the index's
constituents and weights identically, which is, however, cost-ineffective and
impractical. To address this issue, it is required to replicate the index
partially with accurately predicted market sensitivities. Accordingly, we
propose a novel partial-replication method via learning to predict market

sensitivities in a supervised manner with our data-processing methods. Then, we
propose a partial-index-tracking optimization model controlling the net
predicted market sensitivities of the portfolios and index to be the same.
These processes' efficacy is corroborated by our experiments on the Korea Stock

errors compared with historical estimations and competitive tracking errors of
replicating the index utilizing fewer than half of the entire constituents.
Therefore, we show that applying deep learning to predict market sensitivities

Case description information is information that describes the case, e.g., the
subtype of cancer. The exposure may have more of an effect on some types of
cases than other types. We explore how leveraging case description information
can reduce sensitivity to bias from unmeasured confounding through an
asymptotic tool, design sensitivity, and simulation studies. We allow for the
possibility that leveraging case definition information may introduce
additional selection bias through an additional sensitivity parameter. The
proposed methodology is illustrated by re-examining alcohol consumption and the

semantic communication-empowered PNC-enabled TWRC to address the relative phase
offset issue, referred to as SC-PNC. Despite the bad relative phase offsets,
SC-PNC directly extracts the semantic meaning of transmitted messages rather
than ensuring accurate bit stream transmission. We jointly design deep neural
network (DNN)-based transceivers at the end nodes and propose a semantic PNC
decoder at the relay. Taking image delivery as an example, experimental results
show that the SC-PNC TWRC achieves high and stable reconstruction quality for
images under different channel conditions and relative phase offsets, compared
with the conventional bit-oriented counterparts.

capture the local relation. Besides, we retain the global topological structure

feature embeddings, which is theoretically reduced to exchanging the feature
embeddings of the feature and the original graphs to reconstruct themselves.

investigating wave propagation. However, the approximation becomes less
accurate as the wavelength approaches the curvature radius of the background,
which can occur in generic situations. In this paper, we suggest a formulation
for higher-order corrections of the geometrical optics expansion, applied to
Horndeski theory which accommodates many dark energy models. At the level of
the background, assuming that the derivative of the scalar field is
non-vanishing and timelike, we choose the time slices to coincide with the
contours of the scalar field. This choice of the background time slices is
advantageous as the sound cones of both scalar and tensor gravitational waves
are upright with respect to the background time slices whenever the scalar
field behaves as a perfect fluid. We then analyze the equations of motion for
scalar and tensor components of gravitational waves at the leading and
next-to-leading order in the geometrical optics expansion, deriving the
evolution equations for their amplitudes under certain conditions. In
particular, for Generalized Brans-Dicke theories, we find a simple description

cloud denoising, is a fundamental yet challenging problem in geometry

input or filter raw normals followed by updating point positions. Motivated by
the essential interplay between point cloud denoising and normal filtering, we
revisit point cloud denoising from a multitask perspective, and propose an
end-to-end network, named PCDNF, to denoise point clouds via joint normal
filtering. In particular, we introduce an auxiliary normal filtering task to
help the overall network remove noise more effectively while preserving
geometric features more accurately. In addition to the overall architecture,
our network has two novel modules. On one hand, to improve noise removal
performance, we design a shape-aware selector to construct the latent tangent
space representation of the specific point by comprehensively considering the
learned point and normal features and geometry priors. On the other hand, point
features are more suitable for describing geometric details, and normal
features are more conducive for representing geometric structures (e.g., sharp
edges and corners). Combining point and normal features allows us to overcome
their weaknesses. Thus, we design a feature refinement module to fuse point and
normal features for better recovering geometric information. Extensive
evaluations, comparisons, and ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms state-of-the-arts for both point cloud denoising and normal

by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate representation for downstream
tasks. Given the abundant information and complex topology of a large-scale
graph, we argue that redundancy exists in such graphs and will degrade the
training efficiency. Unfortunately, the model scalability severely restricts
the efficiency of training large-scale graphs via vanilla GNNs. Despite recent
advances in sampling-based training methods, sampling-based GNNs generally
overlook the redundancy issue. It still takes intolerable time to train these
models on large-scale graphs. Thereby, we propose to drop redundancy and
improve efficiency of training large-scale graphs with GNNs, by rethinking the
inherent characteristics in a graph.
  In this paper, we pioneer to propose a once-for-all method, termed DropReef,
to drop the redundancy in large-scale graphs. Specifically, we first conduct
preliminary experiments to explore potential redundancy in large-scale graphs.
Next, we present a metric to quantify the neighbor heterophily of all nodes in
a graph. Based on both experimental and theoretical analysis, we reveal the
redundancy in a large-scale graph, i.e., nodes with high neighbor heterophily
and a great number of neighbors. Then, we propose DropReef to detect and drop
the redundancy in large-scale graphs once and for all, helping reduce the
training time while ensuring no sacrifice in the model accuracy. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of DropReef, we apply it to recent state-of-the-art
sampling-based GNNs for training large-scale graphs, owing to the high
precision of such models. With DropReef leveraged, the training efficiency of
models can be greatly promoted. DropReef is highly compatible and is offline
performed, benefiting the state-of-the-art sampling-based GNNs in the present
and future to a significant extent.

number of research studies have demonstrated that machine learning is an
effective and promising approach for malware detection, and some works have
even claimed that their proposed models could achieve 99\% detection accuracy,
leaving little room for further improvement. However, numerous prior studies
have suggested that unrealistic experimental designs bring substantial biases,
resulting in over-optimistic performance in malware detection. Unlike previous
research that examined the detection performance of ML classifiers to locate
the causes, this study employs Explainable AI (XAI) approaches to explore what
ML-based models learned during the training process, inspecting and
interpreting why ML-based malware classifiers perform so well under unrealistic
experimental settings. We discover that temporal sample inconsistency in the
training dataset brings over-optimistic classification performance (up to 99\%
F1 score and accuracy). Importantly, our results indicate that ML models
classify malware based on temporal differences between malware and benign,
rather than the actual malicious behaviors. Our evaluation also confirms the
fact that unrealistic experimental designs lead to not only unrealistic
detection performance but also poor reliability, posing a significant obstacle
to real-world applications. These findings suggest that XAI approaches should
be used to help practitioners/researchers better understand how do AI/ML models
(i.e., malware detection) work -- not just focusing on accuracy improvement.

problem. Trade-offs between security and other priorities (e.g., cost or
performance) are inherent, and resolving them is both challenging and
important. The proliferation of runtime attacks that introduce malicious code
(e.g., by injection) into embedded devices has prompted a range of mitigation
techniques. One popular approach is Remote Attestation (RA), whereby a trusted
entity (verifier) checks the current software state of an untrusted remote
device (prover). RA yields a timely authenticated snapshot of prover state that
verifier uses to decide whether an attack occurred.
  Current RA schemes require verifier to explicitly initiate RA, based on some
unclear criteria. Thus, in case of prover's compromise, verifier only learns
about it late, upon the next RA instance. While sufficient for compromise
detection, some applications would benefit from a more proactive,
prevention-based approach. To this end, we construct CASU: Compromise Avoidance
via Secure Updates. CASU is an inexpensive hardware/software co-design
enforcing: (i) runtime software immutability, thus precluding any illegal
software modification, and (ii) authenticated updates as the sole means of
modifying software. In CASU, a successful RA instance serves as a proof of
successful update, and continuous subsequent software integrity is implicit,
due to the runtime immutability guarantee. This obviates the need for RA in
between software updates and leads to unobtrusive integrity assurance with
guarantees akin to those of prior RA techniques, with better overall
performance.

bias still a necessity in the context of PLMs? To answer the question, we
propose to address the efficiency issues by using an adapter to integrate
structural bias in the PLM and using a cheap-to-compute relative position
structure in place of the syntactic dependency structure. Benchmarking
evaluation is conducted on the SemEval datasets. The results show that our
proposed structural adapter is beneficial to PLMs and achieves state-of-the-art
performance over a range of strong baselines, yet with a light parameter demand
and low latency. Meanwhile, we give rise to the concern that the current
evaluation default with data of small scale is under-confident. Consequently,
we release a large-scale dataset for ASTE. The results on the new dataset hint
that the structural adapter is confidently effective and efficient to a large
scale. Overall, we draw the conclusion that structural bias shall still be a
necessity even with PLMs.

primary mass. The technique requires the knowledge of the appropriate

companions. The recent publication of the Gaia DR3 astrometric orbits used a
schematic version of this approach, identifying 735 astrometric binaries that
might have compact companions. In this communication, we return to the triage
of the DR3 astrometric binaries with more careful analysis, estimating the
probability for its astrometric secondary to be a compact object or a
main-sequence close binary. We compile a sample of 177 systems with
highly-probable non-luminous massive companions, which is smaller but cleaner
than the sample reported in Gaia DR3. The new sample includes 8 candidates to
be black-hole systems with compact-object masses larger than 2.4 $M_\odot$. The
orbital-eccentricity$-$secondary-mass diagram of the other 169 systems suggests
a tentative separation between the white-dwarf and the neutron-star binaries.
Most white-dwarf binaries are characterized by small eccentricities of about

functions rotated by 45 degrees around the optical axis, a 2x2 mini-lens array

a plane conjugated to the pupil. The basic principle consists in acquiring four

wavefront reconstruction capability, we are now in the phase of implementation
of the prototype in the lab. The crossed-sine WFS could achieve a simultaneous
high spatial resolution at the pupil of the tested optics and absolute
measurement accuracy comparable to that attained by laser-interferometers. In

In this setup, we aim to efficiently annotate data from a set of source domains

proposing a set of efficient one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks

an orthogonal optimization to tune the inference complexity at runtime based on
the processed input, hence producing a more flexible HAR system. With
experiments on four datasets, and targeting an ultra-low-power RISC-V MCU, we
show that (i) We are able to obtain a rich set of Pareto-optimal CNNs for HAR,
spanning more than 1 order of magnitude in terms of memory, latency and energy
consumption; (ii) Thanks to adaptive inference, we can derive >20 runtime
operating modes starting from a single CNN, differing by up to 10% in

all previous deep learning methods, reducing the memory occupation by more than
100x. The few methods that obtain better performance (both shallow and deep)
are not compatible with MCU deployment. (iv) All our CNNs are compatible with
real-time on-device HAR with an inference latency <16ms. Their memory

communication networks. It describes the maximum rate at which the information
can be transmitted of a wireless communication system. To support the growing
demand for wireless traffic, wireless networks are becoming more dense and
complicated, leading to a higher difficulty to derive the capacity.
Unfortunately, most existing methods for the capacity calculation take a
polynomial time complexity. This will become unaffordable for future
ultra-dense networks, where both the number of base stations (BSs) and the
number of users are extremely large. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm
TOSE to estimate the capacity for ultra-dense wireless networks. Based on the
spiked model of random matrix theory (RMT), our algorithm can avoid the exact
eigenvalue derivations of large dimensional matrices, which are complicated and
inevitable in conventional capacity calculation methods. Instead, fast
eigenvalue estimations can be realized based on the spike approximations in our
TOSE algorithm. Our simulation results show that TOSE is an accurate and fast
capacity approximation algorithm. Its estimation error is below 5%, and it runs
in linear time, which is much lower than the polynomial time complexity of
existing methods. In addition, TOSE has superior generality, since it is
independent of the distributions of BSs and users, and the shape of network
areas.

  Generation","To be published in ACM MM 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Layout generation is a novel task in computer vision, which combines the
challenges in both object localization and aesthetic appraisal, widely used in
advertisements, posters, and slides design. An accurate and pleasant layout
should consider both the intra-domain relationship within layout elements and
the inter-domain relationship between layout elements and the image. However,
most previous methods simply focus on image-content-agnostic layout generation,
without leveraging the complex visual information from the image. To this end,
we explore a novel paradigm entitled image-conditioned layout generation, which
aims to add text overlays to an image in a semantically coherent manner.
Specifically, we propose an Image-Conditioned Variational Transformer (ICVT)
that autoregressively generates various layouts in an image. First,
self-attention mechanism is adopted to model the contextual relationship within
layout elements, while cross-attention mechanism is used to fuse the visual
information of conditional images. Subsequently, we take them as building
blocks of conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), which demonstrates
appealing diversity. Second, in order to alleviate the gap between layout
elements domain and visual domain, we design a Geometry Alignment module, in
which the geometric information of the image is aligned with the layout
representation. In addition, we construct a large-scale advertisement poster
layout designing dataset with delicate layout and saliency map annotations.
Experimental results show that our model can adaptively generate layouts in the
non-intrusive area of the image, resulting in a harmonious layout design.

state. Here, we focus on a more practical setting in object rearrangement,
i.e., rearranging objects from shuffled layouts to a normative target
distribution without explicit goal specification. However, it remains
challenging for AI agents, as it is hard to describe the target distribution
(goal specification) for reward engineering or collect expert trajectories as
demonstrations. Hence, it is infeasible to directly employ reinforcement
learning or imitation learning algorithms to address the task. This paper aims
to search for a policy only with a set of examples from a target distribution
instead of a handcrafted reward function. We employ the score-matching
objective to train a Target Gradient Field (TarGF), indicating a direction on
each object to increase the likelihood of the target distribution. For object
rearrangement, the TarGF can be used in two ways: 1) For model-based planning,
we can cast the target gradient into a reference control and output actions
with a distributed path planner; 2) For model-free reinforcement learning, the
TarGF is not only used for estimating the likelihood-change as a reward but
also provides suggested actions in residual policy learning. Experimental
results in ball and room rearrangement demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the quality of the
terminal state, the efficiency of the control process, and scalability.

representative of Ryugu. Aims. To understand the apparent discrepancy between
MASCOT observations and Ryugu samples, we assess whether the MASCOT landing
site, and the rock by implication, is perhaps atypical for Ryugu. Methods. We
analyzed observations of the MASCOT landing area acquired by three instruments
on board Hayabusa2: a camera (ONC), a near-infrared spectrometer (NIRS3), and a
thermal infrared imager (TIR). We compared the landing area properties thus
retrieved with those of the average Ryugu surface. Results. We selected several
areas and landforms in the landing area for analysis: a small crater, a
collection of smooth rocks, and the landing site itself. The crater is
relatively blue and the rocks are relatively red. The spectral and
thermophysical properties of the landing site are very close to those of the
average Ryugu surface. The spectral properties of the MASCOT rock are probably
close to average, but its thermal inertia may be somewhat higher. Conclusions.
The MASCOT rock can also be considered representative of Ryugu. Some of the
submillimeter-sized particles in the returned samples stand out because of
their atypical spectral properties. Such particles may be present as inclusions
in the MASCOT rock.

This is particularly the case in insurance pricing where protected policyholder
characteristics are not allowed to be used for insurance pricing. Simply
disregarding protected policyholder information is not an appropriate solution
because this still allows for the possibility of inferring the protected
characteristics from the non-protected ones. This leads to so-called proxy or
indirect discrimination. Though proxy discrimination is qualitatively different
from the group fairness concepts in machine learning, these group fairness
concepts are proposed to 'smooth out' the impact of protected characteristics
in the calculation of insurance prices. The purpose of this note is to share
some thoughts about group fairness concepts in the light of insurance pricing
and to discuss their implications. We present a statistical model that is free
of proxy discrimination, thus, unproblematic from an insurance pricing point of
view. However, we find that the canonical price in this statistical model does
not satisfy any of the three most popular group fairness axioms. This seems
puzzling and we welcome feedback on our example and on the usefulness of these
group fairness axioms for non-discriminatory insurance pricing.

problem that objects at long distance often have very sparse or
partially-occluded point clouds, which makes the features extracted by the
model ambiguous. Ambiguous features will make it hard to locate the target
object and finally lead to bad tracking results. To solve this problem, we
utilize the powerful Transformer architecture and propose a
Point-Track-Transformer (PTT) module for point cloud-based 3D single object
tracking task. Specifically, PTT module generates fine-tuned attention features
by computing attention weights, which guides the tracker focusing on the
important features of the target and improves the tracking ability in complex
scenarios. To evaluate our PTT module, we embed PTT into the dominant method
and construct a novel 3D SOT tracker named PTT-Net. In PTT-Net, we embed PTT
into the voting stage and proposal generation stage, respectively. PTT module
in the voting stage could model the interactions among point patches, which
learns context-dependent features. Meanwhile, PTT module in the proposal
generation stage could capture the contextual information between object and
background. We evaluate our PTT-Net on KITTI and NuScenes datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PTT module and the
superiority of PTT-Net, which surpasses the baseline by a noticeable margin,
~10% in the Car category. Meanwhile, our method also has a significant
performance improvement in sparse scenarios. In general, the combination of
transformer and tracking pipeline enables our PTT-Net to achieve

We demonstrated that the existence of the dual peak absorbance is due to the

We further utilized the excited degenerate propagating surface plasmon to
enhance the fluorescence emission of an emitter located on top of the
metasurface. This was accomplished by engineering a metasurface that excites a
degenerate mode with resonance absorption bands close to the emission

charged dilatonic black holes (the solutions are neither flat nor AdS) in
$(n+1)$-dimensional spacetime is studied herein. To this end, we analyze the
effects of the dimension $n$ and dilaton field $\alpha$ on J-T expansion. An
explicit expression for the J-T coefficient is derived, and consequently, a
negative heat capacity is found to lead to a cooling process. In contrast to
its effect on the dimension, the inversion curve decreases with charge $Q$ at
low pressures, whereas the opposite effect is observed at high pressures. We
can observe that with an increase in the dimension $n$ or parameter $\alpha$,
both the pressure cut-off point and the minimum inversion temperature $T_{min}$
change. Moreover, we analyze the ratio $T_{min}/T_{c}$ numerically and discover
that the ratio is independent of charge; however, it depends on the dilaton
field and dimension: for $n=3$ and $\alpha=0$, the ratio is 1/2. The dilaton
field is found to enhance the ratio. In addition, we identify the
cooling-heating regions by investigating the inversion and isenthalpic curves,
and the behavior of the minimum inversion mass $M_{min}$ indicates that this
cooling-heating transition may not occur under certain special conditions.

the algorithm of path planning is integrated with the DWA algorithm so that the
robot can perform local dynamic obstacle avoidance during the movement along

algorithm combines with the local obstacle avoidance algorithm, the robot can
correct the path after obstacle avoidance and obstacle overcoming. The
simulation experiments in a factory with several complex environments verified

systems with extremely low mass and low mass WDs as companions are formed via
Case-A/Case-B mass transfer mechanism. A BSS is the likely progenitor of the
high mass WD, as a star with more than the turn-off mass of the cluster is

that their properties emerge from a coupling between swelling and elastic

adhesion, and creasing, for which sharp folds appear that can even lead to
phase separation. Here we resolve the singular nature of poroelastic surface
folds and determine the solvent distribution in the vicinity of the fold-tip.
Surprisingly, two opposite scenarios emerge depending on the angle of the fold.
In obtuse folds such as creases, it is found that the solvent is completely
expelled near the crease-tip, according to a nontrivial spatial distribution.
For wetting ridges with acute fold angles, the solvent migration is reversed as
compared to creasing, and the degree of swelling is maximal at the fold-tip. We
discuss how our poroelastic fold-analysis offers an explanation for phase
separation, fracture and contact angle hysteresis.

by MAXI in 2022 May. We study different properties of the pulsar using data
from NuSTAR and NICER observations. The unstable burning of accreted material
on the surface of neutron stars induces thermonuclear (Type-I) bursts. Several
such thermonuclear bursts have been detected by MAXI J1816-195 during its
outburst. We investigate the evolution of the burst profile with flux and
energy using NuSTAR and NICER observations. During the NuSTAR observation, a
total of four bursts were detected from the source. The duration of each burst
is around $\sim$ 30 s and the ratio of peak to persistent count rate is $\sim$
26 as seen from the NuSTAR data. The burst profiles are modelled using a sharp
linear rise and exponential decay function to determine the burst timing
parameters. The burst profiles show a relatively long tail at lower energies.
The broadband time-resolved spectra during the burst periods are successfully
modelled with a combination of an absorbed blackbody along with a non-thermal
component to account for the persistent emission. From our modelling results,
we are able to estimate the maximum apparent emitting area of the blackbody of
the neutron star to be $\sim$12.5 km during the peak of the outburst and the
maximum distance to the object to be 8.7 kpc. Our findings for the mass
accretion rate and the alpha factor indicate the stable burning of hydrogen via
a hot CNO cycle during the bursts.

a label at a fixed position, a timestamp, and a weight. Let a time-window
labeling be a selection of these labels such that all corresponding timestamps
lie in a queried time window and no two labels overlap. A solution to the
time-window labeling problem consists of a data structure that encodes a
time-window labeling for each possible time window; when a user specifies a
time window of interest using a slider interface, we query the data structure
for the corresponding labeling.
  We define the quality of a time-window labeling solution as the sum of the
weights of the labels in each time-window labeling, integrated over all time
windows. We aim at maximizing the quality under the condition that a label may
never disappear when the user shrinks the time window. In this paper, we
analyze how well a greedy heuristic approximates the maximum quality that can
be realized under this condition.
  On the one hand, we present an instance with square labels of equal size and
equal weight for which the greedy heuristic fails to find a solution of at
least 1/4 of the quality of an optimal solution. On the other hand, we prove
that the greedy heuristic does guarantee a solution with at least 1/8 of the

the relative entropy of coherence, $C_r$, in the energy, position and momentum
bases. Although $C_r$ is constant in both the position and the momentum bases,
it is a decreasing function of time in the energy basis becoming zero at long
times, revealing its role as the preferred basis. Then, quantum coherence is
computed for a superposition of two coherent states, a cat state, and also a
superposition of two cat states in the energy basis as a function of
separation, in the complex plane, between the two superposed states. It is seen
that the quantum coherence increases with this separation. Furthermore, quantum
coherence of superposition is compared to that of decomposed states in the
superposition. Finally, considering a system of two non-interacting DHOs, the
effect of quantum statistics is studied on the coherence of reduced
single-particle states, the joint detection probability and the mean square

coherence for antisymmetric states is always less than that of symmetric ones.
Furthermore, boson anti-bunching and fermion bunching is seen in this open

uniform electron gas model at both ambient and warm dense matter conditions.
This gives us unprecedented insights into the performance of different
XC-functionals, and has important implications for the development of new
functionals that are designed for the application at extreme temperatures. In
addition, we obtain new DFT results for the XC kernel of warm dense hydrogen as
it occurs in fusion applications and astrophysical objects. The observed
excellent agreement to the QMC reference data demonstrates that our framework
is capable to capture nontrivial effects such as XC-induced isotropy breaking
in the density response of hydrogen at large wave numbers.

describe the evolution of the system, we derive the expression of the
self-diffusion coefficient of a tagged particle in the suspension, in the limit
of soft interactions between the particles. Our derivation, which relies on the
linearization of the Dean-Kawasaki equations obeyed by the density fields and
on a path-integral representation of the dynamics of the tracer, extends
previous derivations that held for tracers in contact with a single bath. Our
analytical result is confronted to results from Brownian dynamics simulations.
The agreement with numerical simulations is very good even for high densities.
We show how the diffusivity of tracers can be affected by the activity of a
dense environment of soft particles that may represent polymer coils -- a
result that could be of relevance in the interpretation of measurements of
diffusivity in biological media. Finally, our analytical result is general and
can be applied to the diffusion of tracers coupled to different types of
fluctuating environments, provided that their evolution equations are linear
and that the coupling between the tracer and the bath is weak.

statistics of the turbulent phase to assess a part of the system's performance.
Temporal statistics with one source and spatial statistics with two sources are
well-known and are widely used for classical adaptive optics systems. A more
general framework, including both spatial and temporal statistics, can be
useful for the analysis of the existing systems and to support the design of
the future ones. In this paper, we propose an expression of the temporal cross
power spectral densities of the turbulent phases in two distinct beams, that is
from two different sources to two different apertures. We either consider the
phase as it is, without piston, or as its decomposition on Zernike modes. The
general formulas allow to cover a wide variety of configurations, from
single-aperture to interferometric telescopes equipped with adaptive optics,
with the possibility to consider apertures of different sizes and/or sources at
a finite distance. The presented approach should lead to similar results with
respect to existing methods in the Fourier domain, but it is focused on
temporal frequencies rather than spatial ones, which might be convenient for
some aspects such as control optimization. To illustrate this framework with a
simple application, we demonstrate that the wavefront residual due to the
anisoplanatism error in a single-conjugated adaptive optics system is
overestimated when it is computed from covariances without taking into account
the temporal filtering of the adaptive optics loop. We also show this
overestimation in the case of a small-baseline interferometer, for which the
two beams are significantly correlated.

types of spectral-spatial transform, called extended Star-Tetrix transforms
(XSTTs), and their edge-aware versions, called edge-aware XSTTs (EXSTTs), with
no extra bits (side information) and little extra complexity. They are obtained
by (i) extending the Star-Tetrix transform (STT), which is one of the latest
spectral-spatial transforms, to a new version of our previously proposed
wavelet-based spectral-spatial transform and a simpler version, (ii)
considering that each 2-D predict step of the wavelet transform is a
combination of two 1-D diagonal or horizontal-vertical transforms, and (iii)
weighting the transforms along the edge directions in the images. Compared with
XSTTs, the EXSTTs can decorrelate CFA-sampled raw images well: they reduce the
difference in energy between the two green components by about $3.38$--$30.08$
\% for high-quality camera images and $8.97$--$14.47$ \% for mobile phone

high-quality camera images, the XSTTs/EXSTTs produce results equal to or better
than the conventional methods: especially for images with many edges, the

instabilities at the Laplace plane transition were the source of the

previous findings of a weakly dissipative early Earth. If collisionless
encounters with planetesimals up to 140 Myr after Moon formation excited the
inclination, then the Moon had to migrate quickly to pass through the Cassini
state transition at 33 Earth radii and reach a period of limited inclination
damping. The fossil figure was likely established before 16 Earth radii to
match the present-day degree-2 gravity field observations.

precision and dose conformity compared to conventional X-ray irradiation. The
dose conformity of this treatment modality may be further improved if narrower
proton beams are used. Still, this is limited by multiple Coulomb scattering of
protons through tissue. The primary aim of this work was to develop techniques
to produce narrow proton beams and investigate the resulting dose profiles. We
introduced and assessed three different proton beam shaping techniques: 1)
metal collimators (100/150~MeV), 2) focusing of conventional- (100/150~MeV),
and 3) focusing of high-energy (350~MeV, shoot-through) proton beams. Focusing
was governed by the initial value of the Twiss parameter $\alpha$~($\alpha_0$),
and can be implemented with magnetic particle accelerator optics. The dose
distributions in water were calculated by Monte Carlo simulations using Geant4,
and evaluated by target to surface dose ratio (TSDR) in addition to the
transverse beam size~($\sigma_T$) at the target. The target was defined as the
location of the Bragg peak or the focal point. The different techniques showed
greatly differing dose profiles, where focusing gave pronouncedly higher
relative target dose and efficient use of primary protons. Metal collimators
with radii < 2~mm gave low TSDRs (<~0.7) and large $\sigma_T$(>~3.6~mm). In
contrast, a focused beam of conventional (150~MeV) energy produced a very high
TSDR (>~80) with similar $\sigma_T$ as a collimated beam. High-energy focused
beams were able to produce TSDRs > 100 and $\sigma_T$ around 1.5~mm. From this
study, it appears very attractive to implement magnetically focused proton
beams in radiotherapy of small lesions or tumors in close vicinity to healthy
organs at risk. This can also lead to a paradigm change in spatially
fractionated radiotherapy.

common choice is to do so with Graph Neural Networks, but this framework

this work, we propose a more principled way of creating a graph from a 3D

input 3D pointcloud. This transformation is done by an Multi-Later Perceptron
(MLP) with learnable parameters that is optimized through backpropagation
jointly with the rest of the network. We also introduce a regularization method
based on stress minimization, which allows to control how distant is the learnt
graph from our baseline: k-NN over xyz space. This framework is tested on
ModelNet40, where graphs generated by our network outperformed the baseline by
0.3 points in overall accuracy.

apply a graph neural network (GNN) to obtain the embeddings of the clauses in
the conjunctive normal format (CNF). A hierarchical Transformer architecture is
applied on the clause embeddings to capture the relationships among clauses,

SATformer effectively learns the correlations among clauses for SAT prediction.

focus on final position constraints, we model the nonholonomic mobile robot as
a rigid body and introduce the orientation as well as position constraints for
the robot's final states. In other words, robots should not only reach the
specified positions, but also point to the desired orientations simultaneously.
The challenge of this problem lies in the underactuation of full-state motion
planning, since three states need to be planned by mere two control inputs. To
this end, we propose a dynamic vector field (DVF) based on the rigid body
modeling. Specifically, the dynamics of the robot orientation are brought into
the vector field, implying that the vector field is not static on the 2-D plane
anymore, but a dynamic one varying with the attitude angle. Hence, each robot
can move along the integral curve of the DVF to arrive at the desired position,
and in the meantime, the attitude angle can converge to the specified value
following the orientation dynamics. Subsequently, by designing a circular
vector field under the framework of the DVF, we further study the obstacle
avoidance and mutual-robot-collision avoidance in the motion planning. Finally,
numerical simulation examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed methodology.

study a BEC-to-BCS quench. By exploiting a suitable continuum limit of recently

experimentally-accessible characterisation of the stationary state by computing
local pair correlation function as well as the quasi-particle distribution

bottleneck. To alleviate this issue, we adopt multiple loss terms to provide
sufficient constraints during the training stage. Furthermore, with a simple

contributors to the hard diffuse X-ray emission from the Galactic center (GC)
and Galactic ridge. In our ongoing \emph{XMM-Newton} survey of the central
region of the Galactic disk ($20^\circ\times2^\circ$), we detected a persistent
IP candidate, $1.7^\circ$ away from the GC. In this work, we better
characterize the behavior of this source by looking at the new and archival
XMM-Newton data. We performed a detailed X-ray spectral modeling of the source.
Furthermore, we searched for X-ray pulsations in the light curve as well as its
counterpart at other wavelengths. The XMM-Newton spectrum (0.8--10 keV) of the
source is described by a partial covering collisionally ionized diffuse gas
with plasma temperature $kT=15.7^{+20.9}_{-3.6}$ keV. In addition, the spectrum
shows the presence of iron lines at $E=6.44$, 6.65, and 6.92 keV with
equivalent widths of $194^{+89}_{-70}$, $115^{+79}_{-75}$, and $98^{+93}_{-74}$
eV, respectively. The X-ray light curve shows a coherent modulation with a
period of $P=432.44\pm0.36$ s, which we infer is the spin period of the white
dwarf. The white dwarf mass estimated from fitting a physical model to the
spectrum results in $M_{\rm WD}=1.05^{+0.16}_{-0.21}\ M_{\odot}$. We were able
to find a likely optical counterpart in the Gaia catalog with a G magnitude of
19.26, and the distance to the source derived from the measured Gaia parallax
is $\sim$4.3 kpc. We provide an improved source localization with subarcsec
accuracy. The spectral modeling of the source indicates the presence of
intervening circumstellar gas, which absorbs the soft X-ray photons. The

derived two possible rotation period solutions of 2.7 and 4.1 hours. The
corresponding light curve amplitudes computed after correcting for the effect
of coma are 0.28 and 0.58 mag, respectively. Both period solutions are shorter
than the critical rotation limit computed for a strengthless triaxial
ellipsoid, suggesting that rotation mass shedding should at least partly be
responsible for the observed activity. We confirm that the activity level is
fading further, but at a very modest rate of only 0.006 mag/day, still also
compatible with sublimation-driven activity. We found that 248370 likely
belongs to the Themis asteroid family, making it a fourth main-belt comet
associated with this group. Orbital characteristics of 248370 are also
consistent with its origin in the young 288P cluster of asteroids. The 288P
cluster is associated with its namesake main-belt comet, providing an exciting
possibility for a comparative analysis of intriguing main-belt comets 248370

with subtle tensions between normalization, graduality, and conservativity with
respect to CIC. Recently, GCIC has been proposed as a parametrized gradual type
theory that admits three variants, each sacrificing one of these properties.
For devising a gradual proof assistant based on CIC, normalization and
conservativity with respect to CIC are key, but the tension with graduality
needs to be addressed. Additionally, several challenges remain: (1) The
presence of two wildcard terms at any type-the error and unknown terms-enables
trivial proofs of any theorem, jeopardizing the use of a gradual type theory in
a proof assistant; (2) Supporting general indexed inductive families, most
prominently equality, is an open problem; (3) Theoretical accounts of gradual
typing and graduality so far do not support handling type mismatches detected
during reduction; (4) Precision and graduality are external notions not
amenable to reasoning within a gradual type theory. All these issues manifest
primally in CastCIC, the cast calculus used to define GCIC. In this work, we
present an extension of CastCIC called GRIP. GRIP is a reasonably gradual type
theory that addresses the issues above, featuring internal precision and
general exception handling. GRIP features an impure (gradual) sort of types
inhabited by errors and unknown terms, and a pure (non-gradual) sort of strict
propositions for consistent reasoning about gradual terms. Internal precision
supports reasoning about graduality within GRIP itself, for instance to
characterize gradual exception-handling terms, and supports gradual subset
types. We develop the metatheory of GRIP using a model formalized in Coq, and
provide a prototype implementation of GRIP in Agda.

salient structures of an image while removing insignificant details. Deep
learning has been explored in image smoothing to deal with the complex
entanglement of semantic structures and trivial details. However, current
methods neglect two important facts in smoothing: 1) naive pixel-level
regression supervised by the limited number of high-quality smoothing
ground-truth could lead to domain shift and cause generalization problems
towards real-world images; 2) texture appearance is closely related to object
semantics, so that image smoothing requires awareness of semantic difference to
apply adaptive smoothing strengths. To address these issues, we propose a novel
Contrastive Semantic-Guided Image Smoothing Network (CSGIS-Net) that combines
both contrastive prior and semantic prior to facilitate robust image smoothing.
The supervision signal is augmented by leveraging undesired smoothing effects
as negative teachers, and by incorporating segmentation tasks to encourage
semantic distinctiveness. To realize the proposed network, we also enrich the
original VOC dataset with texture enhancement and smoothing labels, namely
VOC-smooth, which first bridges image smoothing and semantic segmentation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSGIS-Net outperforms

is one of the most important tasks in the pharmaceutical industry. Deep
generative models have been applied to targeted molecular design and have shown
promising results. Recently, target-specific molecule generation has been
viewed as a translation between the protein language and the chemical language.
However, such a model is limited by the availability of interacting
protein-ligand pairs. On the other hand, large amounts of unlabeled protein
sequences and chemical compounds are available and have been used to train
language models that learn useful representations. In this study, we propose
exploiting pretrained biochemical language models to initialize (i.e. warm
start) targeted molecule generation models. We investigate two warm start
strategies: (i) a one-stage strategy where the initialized model is trained on
targeted molecule generation (ii) a two-stage strategy containing a
pre-finetuning on molecular generation followed by target specific training. We
also compare two decoding strategies to generate compounds: beam search and
sampling.
  Results: The results show that the warm-started models perform better than a
baseline model trained from scratch. The two proposed warm-start strategies
achieve similar results to each other with respect to widely used metrics from
benchmarks. However, docking evaluation of the generated compounds for a number
of novel proteins suggests that the one-stage strategy generalizes better than
the two-stage strategy. Additionally, we observe that beam search outperforms
sampling in both docking evaluation and benchmark metrics for assessing
compound quality.

Results show greater inclinations of the shoulder/torso towards the ground in

pigment-protein complex system with the eventual aim of modelling and
engineering similar dynamics in other systems and use it for real time

efficiency to wave-like behaviour and non-Markovian quantum jumps resulting in
long lived and revival of quantum coherence, respectively. Since dynamics in
these systems resides in quantum-classical regime, quantum simulation of such
dynamics will help in exploring the subtle role of quantum features in
enhancing the transport efficiency which has remained unsettled. Discrete
quantum simulation of the FMO complex dynamics can help in efficient
engineering of the heat bath and controlling the environment with the system.

exist, they are either specialized for certain domains or require extensive
code rewriting to work for different contexts in the code. In this paper, we
introduce a new methodology for writing programs with holes, that is, decision
variables explicitly stated in the program code that enable developers to
postpone decisions during development. We introduce and evaluate two novel
ideas: (i) context-sensitive holes that are expanded by the compiler into sets
of decision variables for automatic tuning, and (ii) dependency-aware tuning,
where static analysis reduces the search space by finding the set of decision
variables that can be tuned independently of each other. We evaluate the two
new concepts in a system called Miking, where we show how the general
methodology can be used for automatic algorithm selection, data structure
decisions, and parallelization choices.

general weight parameters using $n$ function values at lattice points. We do
not limit $n$ to be a prime number, as in currently available literature, but
allow any number of points, including powers of $2$, thus providing the
fundamental theory for construction of embedded lattice sequences. Our results
are constructive in that we provide a component-by-component algorithm which
constructs a suitable generating vector for a given number of points or even a
range of numbers of points. It does so without needing to construct the index
set on which the functions will be represented. The resulting generating vector
can then be used to approximate functions in the underlying weighted Korobov
space. We analyse the approximation error in the worst-case setting under both
the $L_2$ and $L_{\infty}$ norms. Our component-by-component construction under
the $L_2$ norm achieves the best possible rate of convergence for lattice-based
algorithms, and the theory can be applied to lattice-based kernel methods and
splines. Depending on the value of the smoothness parameter $\alpha$, we
propose two variants of the search criterion in the construction under the
$L_{\infty}$ norm, extending previous results which hold only for product-type
weight parameters and prime $n$. We also provide a theoretical upper bound
showing that embedded lattice sequences are essentially as good as lattice
rules with a fixed value of $n$. Under some standard assumptions on the weight
parameters, the worst-case error bound is independent of $d$.

that the noise should be treated as an information to be exploited, not simply

problems. Such problems are formulated with alternating min/max quantifiers and
therefore naturally fall into a higher stage of the polynomial hierarchy.
Despite this, almost no hardness results with respect to the polynomial

  In this work, we examine the hardness of robust two-stage adjustable and
robust recoverable optimization with budgeted uncertainty sets. Our main
technical contribution is the introduction of a technique tailored to prove
$\Sigma^p_3$-hardness of such problems. We highlight a difference between
continuous and discrete budgeted uncertainty: In the discrete case, indeed a
wide range of problems becomes complete for the third stage of the polynomial
hierarchy; in particular, this applies to the TSP, independent set, and vertex
cover problems. However, in the continuous case this does not happen and
problems remain in the first stage of the hierarchy. Finally, if we allow the
uncertainty to not only affect the objective, but also multiple constraints,
then this distinction disappears and even in the continuous case we encounter
hardness for the third stage of the hierarchy. This shows that even robust
problems which are already NP-complete can still exhibit a significant
computational difference between column-wise and row-wise uncertainty.

on the specific influence mechanisms of host dissipation on the extinction
efficiency factors of a plasmonic nanosphere. To this end, we isolate the
dissipative effects by comparing the dispersive and dissipative host with its
transparent counterpart. As a result, we identify the damping effects of host
dissipation on the LSPR including the resonance widening and amplitude
reducing. The resonance positions are shifted by host dissipation, which cannot
be predicted by the classical Fr\""ohlich condition. Finally, we demonstrate
that a wide-band extinction enhancement due to host dissipation can be realized
away from the positions of LSPR.

vertices and degree $d \geq 3$. It is known that consensus is reached on time
scale $n$ and that on this time scale the volume of the set of vertices with
one opinion evolves as a Fisher-Wright diffusion. We are interested in the
evolution of the number of discordant edges (i.e., edges linking vertices with
different opinions), which can be thought as the perimeter of the set of
vertices with one opinion. We show that if initially the two opinions are drawn
independently from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $u \in (0,1)$, then
on time scale $1$ the fraction of discordant edges decreases and stabilises to
a value that depends on $d$ and $u$, and is related to the meeting time of two
random walks on an infinity tree of degree $d$ starting from two neighbouring
vertices. Moreover, we show that on time scale $n$ the fraction of discordant
edges moves away from the constant plateau and converges to zero in an
exponential fashion. Our proofs exploit the classical dual system of coalescing
random walks and use ideas from \cite{CFRmultiple} built on the so-called First
Visit Time Lemma. We further introduce a novel technique to derive
concentration properties from weak-dependence of coalescing random walks on

present TOPz performance on data from the miniJPAS survey, a precursor to the
J-PAS survey with an identical filter system. First, we generated spectral
templates based on the miniJPAS sources using the synthetic galaxy spectrum
generation software CIGALE. Then we applied corrections to the input photometry
by minimising systematic offsets from the template flux in each filter. To
assess the accuracy of the redshift estimation, we used spectroscopic redshifts
from the DEEP2, DEEP3, and SDSS surveys, available for 1989 miniJPAS galaxies
with r < 22 magAB. We also tested how the choice and number of input templates,
photo-z priors, and photometric corrections affect the TOPz redshift accuracy.
The general performance of the combination of miniJPAS data and the TOPz
workflow fulfills the expectations for J-PAS redshift accuracy. Similarly to
previous estimates, we find that 38.6% of galaxies with r < 22 mag reach the
J-PAS redshift accuracy goal of dz/(1 + z) < 0.003. Limiting the number of

arbitrarily large period waves which arise from a homoclinic (global)

Additivity provides statistical advantages, where contrasts in exposures are

fiducial marker detection remains an unsolved problem. In this letter, we
develop a novel algorithm to detect the fiducial markers in the multi-viewpoint

non-distinguishable from the planes to which they are attached. Second, marker
detection verifies if the candidate ROIs contain fiducial markers and outputs
the ID numbers and vertices locations of the markers in the valid ROIs. In
particular, the ROIs are transmitted to a predefined intermediate plane for the
purpose of adopting a spherical projection to generate the intensity image, and
then, marker detection is completed through the intensity image. Qualitative

effective tool to simultaneously increase the accuracy and the efficiency of
quasiclassical trajectory methods in the simulation of nonadiabatic quantum

equation of motion, involving memory kernels which are typically fast-decaying
and can therefore be computed by short-time quasiclassical trajectories. In
this paper we study the approximate solution of the GQME, obtained by
calculating the kernels with two methods, namely Ehrenfest mean-field theory
and spin mapping. We test the approaches on a range of spin--boson models with
increasing energy bias between the two electronic levels and place a particular
focus on the long-time limits of the populations. We find that the accuracy of
the predictions of the GQME depends strongly on the specific technique used to
calculate the kernels. In particular, spin mapping outperforms Ehrenfest for
all systems studied. The problem of unphysical negative electronic populations
affecting spin mapping is resolved by coupling the method with the master
equation. Conversely, Ehrenfest in conjunction with the GQME can predict
negative populations, despite the fact that the populations calculated from
direct dynamics are positive definite.

a wide range of conditions emulated on a testbed using real residential
broadband equipment, queue delay remained both low (median 100--300 $\mu$s) and
consistent (99th percentile below 2 ms even under highly dynamic workloads),
without compromising other metrics (zero congestion loss and close to full
utilization). L4S exploits the properties of `Scalable' congestion controls
(e.g., DCTCP, TCP Prague). Flows using such congestion control are however very
aggressive, which causes a deployment challenge as L4S has to coexist with
so-called `Classic' flows (e.g., Reno, CUBIC). This paper introduces an
architectural solution: `Dual Queue Coupled Active Queue Management', which
enables balance between Scalable and Classic flows. It counterbalances the more
aggressive response of Scalable flows with more aggressive marking, without
having to inspect flow identifiers. The Dual Queue structure has been
implemented as a Linux queuing discipline. It acts like a semi-permeable
membrane, isolating the latency of Scalable and `Classic' traffic, but coupling
their capacity into a single bandwidth pool. This paper justifies the design
and implementation choices, and visualizes a representative selection of
hundreds of thousands of experiment runs to test our claims.

that the DeWitt-Schwinger representation of the Feynman Green's function is a
particular case of the Hadamard representation. Next, we restrict attention to
a spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe with
time-dependent, purely electric, background electromagnetic field, considering
two, three and four-dimensional space-times. Working to the order required for
the renormalization of the stress-energy tensor (SET), we find the adiabatic
and DeWitt-Schwinger expansions of the Green's function when the space-time
points are spatially separated. In two and four dimensions, the resulting
DeWitt-Schwinger and adiabatic expansions are identical. In three dimensions,
the DeWitt-Schwinger expansion contains terms of adiabatic order four which are
not necessary for the renormalization of the SET and hence absent in the
adiabatic expansion. The equivalence of the DeWitt-Schwinger and adiabatic
approaches to renormalization in the scenario considered is thereby
demonstrated up to well-known renormalization ambiguities in three space-time

such as financial systems and e-commerce systems. In a temporal network, the
joint neighborhood of a set of nodes often provides crucial structural
information useful for predicting whether they may interact at a certain time.
However, recent representation learning methods for temporal networks often
fail to extract such information or depend on online construction of structural
features, which is time-consuming. To address the issue, this work proposes
Neighborhood-Aware Temporal network model (NAT). For each node in the network,
NAT abandons the commonly-used one-single-vector-based representation while
adopting a novel dictionary-type neighborhood representation. Such a dictionary
representation records a downsampled set of the neighboring nodes as keys, and
allows fast construction of structural features for a joint neighborhood of
multiple nodes. We also design a dedicated data structure termed N-cache to
support parallel access and update of those dictionary representations on GPUs.
NAT gets evaluated over seven real-world large-scale temporal networks. NAT not
only outperforms all cutting-edge baselines by averaged 1.2% and 4.2% in
transductive and inductive link prediction accuracy, respectively, but also
keeps scalable by achieving a speed-up of 4.1-76.7x against the baselines that
adopt joint structural features and achieves a speed-up of 1.6-4.0x against the
baselines that cannot adopt those features. The link to the code: https:

simplify the I&M decision problem to the component level due to the
computational complexity associated with global optimization methodologies
under joint system-level state descriptions. In this paper, we propose an
efficient algorithmic framework for inference and decision-making under
uncertainty for engineering systems exposed to deteriorating environments,
providing optimal management strategies directly at the system level. In our
approach, the decision problem is formulated as a factored partially observable
Markov decision process, whose dynamics are encoded in Bayesian network
conditional structures. The methodology can handle environments under equal or
general, unequal deterioration correlations among components, through Gaussian
hierarchical structures and dynamic Bayesian networks. In terms of policy
optimization, we adopt a deep decentralized multi-agent actor-critic (DDMAC)
reinforcement learning approach, in which the policies are approximated by
actor neural networks guided by a critic network. By including deterioration
dependence in the simulated environment, and by formulating the cost model at
the system level, DDMAC policies intrinsically consider the underlying
system-effects. This is demonstrated through numerical experiments conducted
for both a 9-out-of-10 system and a steel frame under fatigue deterioration.
Results demonstrate that DDMAC policies offer substantial benefits when
compared to state-of-the-art heuristic approaches. The inherent consideration
of system-effects by DDMAC strategies is also interpreted based on the learned
policies.

been found to more closely mirror properties found in real world networks than
the traditional uniform random graph models. In this paper we introduce a new,
Iterative Independent Model (IIM), generalizing previously defined models.
These models use ideas from Structural Balance Theory to generate edges through
a notion of cloning where ``the friend of my friend is my friend'' and
anticloning where ``the enemy of my enemy is my friend''. In this paper, we
vastly generalize these notions by allowing each vertex added at a given time
step to choose independently of the other vertices if it will be cloned or
anticloned. While it may seem natural to focus on a randomized model, where we
randomly determine whether or not to clone any given vertex, we found the
general deterministic model exhibited certain structural properties regardless
of the probabilities. This allows applications to then explore the particulars,
while having the theoretical model explain the structural phenomenons that
occur in all possible scenarios.
  Throughout the paper we demonstrate that all IIM graphs have spectral gap
bounded away from zero, which indicates the clustering properties also found in
social networks. Furthermore, we show bounds on the diameter, domination
number, and clique number further indicating the well clustered behaviour of
IIM graphs. Finally, for any fixed graph $F$ all IIM graphs will eventually
contain an induced copy of $F$.

finding these measures and integrals. However, if the differential system
contains many parameters, this approach can lead to highly complex results that

cases be substantially reduced by using aromatic series. These are a
mathematical tool introduced independently by Chartier and Murua and by
Iserles, Quispel and Tse. We develop an algorithm for this purpose and derive
some necessary conditions for the Kahan map to have preserved measures and

the success of this method lies in the equivariance of the map from vector

total length $N$, introduced to represent a set of related DNA sequences, also
known as a pangenome. The ED string matching (EDSM) problem consists in
reporting all occurrences of a pattern of length $m$ in an ED text. This
problem has recently received some attention by the combinatorial pattern
matching community, culminating in an
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(nm^{\omega-1})+\mathcal{O}(N)$-time algorithm [Bernardini
et al., SIAM J. Comput. 2022], where $\omega$ denotes the matrix multiplication
exponent and the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ notation suppresses polylog
factors. In the $k$-EDSM problem, the approximate version of EDSM, we are asked
to report all pattern occurrences with at most $k$ errors. $k$-EDSM can be
solved in $\mathcal{O}(k^2mG+kN)$ time, under edit distance, or
$\mathcal{O}(kmG+kN)$ time, under Hamming distance, where $G$ denotes the total
number of strings in the ED text [Bernardini et al., Theor. Comput. Sci. 2020].
Unfortunately, $G$ is only bounded by $N$, and so even for $k=1$, the existing
algorithms run in $\Omega(mN)$ time in the worst case. In this paper we show
that $1$-EDSM can be solved in $\mathcal{O}((nm^2 + N)\log m)$ or
$\mathcal{O}(nm^3 + N)$ time under edit distance. For the decision version, we
present a faster $\mathcal{O}(nm^2\sqrt{\log m} + N\log\log m)$-time algorithm.
We also show that $1$-EDSM can be solved in $\mathcal{O}(nm^2 + N\log m)$ time
under Hamming distance. Our algorithms for edit distance rely on non-trivial
reductions from $1$-EDSM to special instances of classic computational geometry
problems (2d rectangle stabbing or 2d range emptiness), which we show how to
solve efficiently. In order to obtain an even faster algorithm for Hamming
distance, we rely on employing and adapting the $k$-errata trees for indexing
with errors [Cole et al., STOC 2004].

straight waveguides connected by two multi-mode waveguide bends (MWBs). In
particular, the MWBs are based on modified Euler curves, and a multi-mode
straight waveguide directional coupler is used for the fundamental mode
coupling and avoid exciting higher-order modes in the racetrack. In this way,
the fundamental mode is excited and propagates in the multi-mode racetrack
resonator with ultra-low loss. Meanwhile, it helps to achieve a compact
180{\deg} bend to reduce the chip footprint. In this paper, the propagation
loss of the fundamental mode is significantly reduced with standard fabrication
process by broadening the waveguides width to as wide as 3{\mu}m. Results show
that an ultra-high-Q resonator with an intrinsic Q of TE mode is 4.57*10^7, and
the corresponding propagation loss of the waveguide is only 1.80 dB/m. To the

models is becoming popular. However, ML models are vulnerable to privacy
attacks that leak information about the training data. In this work, we focus
on a particular type of privacy attacks named property inference attack (PIA)
which infers the sensitive properties of the training data through the access
to the target ML model. In particular, we consider Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
as the target model, and distribution of particular groups of nodes and links
in the training graph as the target property. While the existing work has
investigated PIAs that target at graph-level properties, no prior works have
studied the inference of node and link properties at group level yet.
  In this work, we perform the first systematic study of group property
inference attacks (GPIA) against GNNs. First, we consider a taxonomy of threat
models under both black-box and white-box settings with various types of
adversary knowledge, and design six different attacks for these settings. We
evaluate the effectiveness of these attacks through extensive experiments on
three representative GNN models and three real-world graphs. Our results
demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks whose accuracy outperforms the
baseline approaches. Second, we analyze the underlying factors that contribute
to GPIA's success, and show that the target model trained on the graphs with or
without the target property represents some dissimilarity in model parameters
and/or model outputs, which enables the adversary to infer the existence of the
property. Further, we design a set of defense mechanisms against the GPIA
attacks, and demonstrate that these mechanisms can reduce attack accuracy
effectively with small loss on GNN model accuracy.

trapped at the origin. To keep this dark Higgs trapped until around the
matter-radiation equality, we use dark photons produced non-thermally by
coherent oscillations of axions, which have a much stronger trapping effect
than thermal mass. When the trapping ends, the dark Higgs quickly decays into
dark photons, which are then red-shifted as radiation. The dark Higgs EDE
scenario works well for an ordinary Mexican-hat potential, and the dark Higgs
naturally sits at the origin from the beginning, since it is the
symmetry-enhanced point. Thus, unlike the axion EDE, there is no need for
elaborate potentials or fine-tuning with respect to the initial condition.
Interestingly, the axion not only produces dark photons, but also explains dark
matter. We find the viable parameter region of the axion decay constant and the
axion mass where dark matter and the $H_0$ tension can be simultaneously
explained. We also discuss the detectability of the axion in the presence of
axion-photon coupling, and show that the axion can be the QCD axion.

necessary to fully describe PSTs in bulk three-dimensional materials.

sources for space-borne GW detectors. The signals of EMRIs usually have long
timescales, ranging from several months to several years, and their detection
requires accurate GW signal templates. In most waveform models, the compact
objects in EMRIs are considered test particles, which do not consider the small
bodies' spin, mass distribution, and tidal deformation. In this work, we
simulate the GW signals of EMRIs by considering the compact objects' spin and
mass quadrupole. We find that a compact object's spin can significantly
influence the GW signals, and the tidal-induced and spin-induced quadrupoles
matter only if the compact objects are white dwarfs, especially EMRIs of a
higher symmetric mass ratio. We can distinguish white dwarfs from other compact
objects in this case. The structures of black holes and neutron stars in EMRIs
do not have detectable effects on GW signals. Furthermore, compared with the GW
signals that use test particle approximation, the signal-to-noise ratios(SNRs)
of GW signals that consider extended bodies decrease slightly, which hints that
we can omit the spin and quadrupole of the compact object in the detection of
EMRIs.

this work, we propose and analyze a nonlinear-optical route to PNR QND using

coherent pump field driving a phase-mismatched optical parametric amplifier

measurement of the signal Bogoliubov excitations, projecting the signal mode to
a squeezed photon-number state. We then show how our nonlinear OPA dynamics can
be utilized for deterministically generating Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states
only with additional Gaussian resources, offering an all-optical route for
fault-tolerant QIP in continuous-variable systems. Finally, we place these QND
schemes into a more traditional context by highlighting analogies between the
phase-mismatched optical parametric oscillator and multilevel atom-cavity QED
systems, by showing how continuous monitoring of the outcoupled pump quadrature
induces conditional localization of the intracavity signal mode onto squeezed
photon-number states. Our analysis suggests that our proposal may be viable in

against using the derivatives of the iterative linear quadratic regulator

Instead, optimizing using DDP gradients converges to the same optimum for a
range of initial designs allowing our formulation to scale to complex systems.

optimizes the expectation of a uncertainty-perturbed objective function and
subjects to a new type of constraints--the probabilistically robust constraints
(PRC). This novel logic model is an alternative to, but more general than, the
existing ones like the stochastic, robust, and chance-constrained models. The
novelty mainly resides in the newly defined PRC which logically requires that
an optimal solution should be feasible to high-probability realizations of the
uncertain variables. Given that the existing methods of obtaining deterministic
approximations are either inapplicable or inefficient to this new logic model,
we propose a novel solution paradigm. First, the logic model is approximated by
a data-driven deterministic program following an alpha-process of the input
data (scenario) set. A sufficient condition on the relation between the
accuracy of deterministic approximation and the needed number of input
scenarios is provided. Second, the concept of strategic scenario selection
(S^3) is developed to figure out a limited number of active scenarios as the
input to the data-driven deterministic approximation. Three S^3 algorithms are
designed for the cases of discrete, continuous, and mixed-integer uncertain
variables respectively, which are not sensitive to the continuity of the
decision variables. Numerical experiments showed that the S^3-based data-driven
program can accurately approximate the new logic model with low computational
complexity.

research has provided a reproducible benchmark for DG, pointing out the
effectiveness of naive empirical risk minimization (ERM) over existing
algorithms. Nevertheless, researchers persist in using the same outdated
feature extractors, and no attention has been given to the effects of different
backbones yet. In this paper, we start back to the backbones proposing a
comprehensive analysis of their intrinsic generalization capabilities, which so
far have been ignored by the research community. We evaluate a wide variety of
feature extractors, from standard residual solutions to transformer-based
architectures, finding an evident linear correlation between large-scale
single-domain classification accuracy and DG capability. Our extensive
experimentation shows that by adopting competitive backbones in conjunction
with effective data augmentation, plain ERM outperforms recent DG solutions and
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Moreover, our additional qualitative
studies reveal that novel backbones give more similar representations to
same-class samples, separating different domains in the feature space. This
boost in generalization capabilities leaves marginal room for DG algorithms. It
suggests a new paradigm for investigating the problem, placing backbones in the
spotlight and encouraging the development of consistent algorithms on top of

discs. Our target stars have spectral types between early F and late K, a
median age of 400 Myr, and a median distance of 45 pc. We determine for all

high-cadence RV survey and activity characterization. We achieve a median

scatter of our targets (median 22 m/s), which is mostly caused by stellar
activity and decays with age from >100 m/s at <20 Myr to <20 m/s at >500 Myr.
We discover six previously unknown close companions with orbital periods
between 10 and 100 days, three of which are low-mass stars, and three are in
the brown dwarf mass regime. We detect no hot companion with an orbital period
<10 days down to a median mass limit of ~1 M_Jup for stars younger than 500
Myr, which is still compatible with the established occurrence rate of such
companions around main-sequence stars. We find significant RV periodicities
between 1.3 and 4.5 days for 14 stars, which are, however, all caused by
rotational modulation due to starspots. We also analyse the TESS photometric
time series data and find significant periodicities for most of the stars. For
11 stars, the photometric periods are also clearly detected in the RV data. We
also derive stellar rotation periods ranging from 1 to 10 days for 91 stars,
mostly from TESS data. From the intrinsic activity-related short-term RV

machine learning, wireless networks, crowdsourcing, and healthcare systems.
This paper considers a multi-server system with multiple servers and multiple
types of jobs, where different job types require different amounts of
processing time at different servers. The goal is to schedule jobs on servers
without knowing the statistics of the processing times. To fully utilize the
processing power of the servers, it is known that one has to at least learn the
service rates of different job types on different servers. Prior works on this
topic decouple the learning and scheduling phases which leads to either
excessive exploration or extremely large job delays. We propose a new
algorithm, which combines the MaxWeight scheduling policy with discounted upper
confidence bound (UCB), to simultaneously learn the statistics and schedule
jobs to servers. We prove that under our algorithm the asymptotic average queue
length is bounded by one divided by the traffic slackness, which is order-wise
optimal. We also obtain an exponentially decaying probability tail bound for
any-time queue length. These results hold for both stationary and nonstationary
service rates. Simulations confirm that the delay performance of our algorithm
is several orders of magnitude better than previously proposed algorithms.

verification for a subset of information flow properties encompassing
constant-time and secret-erasure. These properties are crucial for
cryptographic implementations, but are generally not preserved by compilers.
Our proposal builds on relational symbolic execution enhanced with new
optimizations dedicated to information flow and binary-level analysis, yielding
a dramatic improvement over prior work based on symbolic execution. We
implement a prototype, Binsec/Rel, for bug-finding and bounded-verification of
constant-time and secret-erasure, and perform extensive experiments on a set of
338 cryptographic implementations, demonstrating the benefits of our approach.
Using Binsec/Rel, we also automate two prior manual studies on preservation of
constant-time and secret-erasure by compilers for a total of 4148 and 1156
binaries respectively. Interestingly, our analysis highlights incorrect usages
of volatile data pointer for secret erasure and shows that scrubbing mechanisms
based on volatile function pointers can introduce additional register spilling
which might break secret-erasure. We also discovered that gcc -O0 and backend
passes of clang introduce violations of constant-time in implementations that
were previously deemed secure by a state-of-the-art constant-time verification
tool operating at LLVM level, showing the importance of reasoning at
binary-level.

field in AdS$_{d+1}$. First, we consider the spacelike reconstruction kernel
for the non-normalizable mode in global coordinates. We construct it as a mode
sum. In even bulk dimensions, this can be reproduced using a chordal Green's
function approach that we propose. This puts the global AdS results for the
non-normalizable mode on an equal footing with results in the literature for
the normalizable mode. In Poincar\'e AdS, we present explicit mode sum results
in general even and odd dimensions for both normalizable and non-normalizable
kernels. For generic scaling dimension $\Delta$, these can be re-written in a
form that matches with the global AdS results via an antipodal mapping, plus a
remainder. We are not aware of a general argument in the literature for
dropping these remainder terms, but we note that a slight complexification of a
boundary spatial coordinate (which we call an $i \epsilon$ prescription) allows
us to do so in cases where $\Delta$ is (half-) integer. Since the
non-normalizable mode turns on a source in the CFT, our primary motivation for
considering it is as a step towards understanding linear wave equations in
general spacetimes from a holographic perspective. But when the scaling
dimension $\Delta$ is in the Breitenlohner-Freedman window, we note that the
construction has some interesting features within AdS/CFT.

production line without appropriate consideration of market volatility can lead
to bankruptcy, and how high transportation cost together with increased

$\max_{S \in \mathcal S}|{\chi(S)}|$, where $\chi(S)=\sum\limits_{x \in

  We propose a randomized algorithm which, for any $d>0$ and $(X,\mathcal S)$
with dual shatter function $\pi^*(k)=O(k^d)$, returns a coloring with expected
discrepancy $O\left({\sqrt{|X|^{1-1/d}\log|\mathcal S|}}\right)$ (this bound is

improving upon the previous-best time of $O\left(|\mathcal S|\cdot|X|^3\right)$
by at least a factor of $|X|^{2-1/d}$ when $|\mathcal S|\geq|X|$. This setup
includes many geometric classes, families of bounded dual VC-dimension, and
others. As an immediate consequence, we obtain an improved algorithm to

  Our method uses primal-dual reweighing with an improved analysis of randomly

matchings with low crossing number -- a fundamental structure in computational

construction time of matchings with crossing number
$O\left({|X|^{1-1/d}}\right)$, which is the first improvement since the 1980s.
  The proposed algorithms are very simple, which makes it possible, for the

organized screening has reduced breast cancer mortality and, consequently, the
European Union has recommended screening with mammography for 50-69-year-old
women. This recommendation is followed well in Europe. Widening the screening
target age further is supported by conditional recommendations for 45-49- and
70-74-year-old women. However, before extending screening to new age groups,
it's essential to carefully consider the benefits and costs locally as
circumstances vary between different regions and/or countries. We propose a new
approach to assess cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening for a
long-ongoing program with incomplete historical screening data. The new model
is called flexible stage distribution model. It is based on estimating the
stage distributions of breast cancer cases under different screening
strategies. In the model, an ongoing screening strategy may be used as a
baseline and other screening strategies may be incorporated by changes in the
incidence rates. The model is flexible, as it enables to apply different
approaches for estimating the altered stage distributions. Thus, if randomized
data is available, one may rely on that. On the other hand, if randomized data
is not available, altered stage distributions may be estimated by extrapolating
the stage distributions of the youngest and oldest screened/non-screened age
groups. We apply the proposed flexible stage distribution model for assessing
incremental cost of extending the current biennial breast cancer screening to
younger and older target ages in Finland.

when serious occlusion happens. On the other hand, existing bottom-up methods
consider all people at the same time and capture the global knowledge of the

the scale variation. To address these problems, we propose a novel
Dual-Pipeline Integrated Transformer (DPIT) by integrating top-down and
bottom-up pipelines to explore the visual clues of different receptive fields
and achieve their complementarity. Specifically, DPIT consists of two branches,
the bottom-up branch deals with the whole image to capture the global visual
information, while the top-down branch extracts the feature representation of
local vision from the single-human bounding box. Then, the extracted feature
representations from bottom-up and top-down branches are fed into the
transformer encoder to fuse the global and local knowledge interactively.
Moreover, we define the keypoint queries to explore both full-scene and
single-human posture visual clues to realize the mutual complementarity of the
two pipelines. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first works to
integrate the bottom-up and top-down pipelines with transformers for human pose
estimation. Extensive experiments on COCO and MPII datasets demonstrate that
our DPIT achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods.

the ResNet50 architecture, we demonstrate some experiments of the performance
of recently proposed robust training techniques and strategies, such as Augmix,

indicate that these robust training techniques can improve the robustness of
deep networks to color variation.

two important elements: the multiplexity of connections as well as representing
time. To this end, in this paper, we present a new dynamic heterogeneous graph
representation for social networks which includes time in every single
component of the graph, i.e., nodes and edges, each of different types that
captures heterogeneity. We illustrate the power of this representation by
presenting four time-dependent queries and deep learning problems that cannot
easily be handled in conventional homogeneous graph representations commonly
used. As a proof of concept we present a detailed representation of a new
social media platform (Steemit), which we use to illustrate both the dynamic
querying capability as well as prediction tasks using graph neural networks
(GNNs). The results illustrate the power of the dynamic heterogeneous graph
representation to model social networks. Given that this is a relatively
understudied area we also illustrate opportunities for future work in query
optimization as well as new dynamic prediction tasks on heterogeneous graph
structures.

importance of these networks security becomes prominent. Different intrusion
attacks to networks have been designed and the attackers are working on
improving them. Thus the ability to detect intrusion with limited number of
labeled data is desirable to provide networks with higher level of security. In
this paper we design an intrusion detection system based on a deep neural
network. The proposed system is based on self-supervised contrastive learning
where a huge amount of unlabeled data can be used to generate informative
representation suitable for various downstream tasks with limited number of
labeled data. Using different experiments, we have shown that the proposed
system presents an accuracy of 94.05% over the UNSW-NB15 dataset, an
improvement of 4.22% in comparison to previous method based on self-supervised
learning. Our simulations have also shown impressive results when the size of
labeled training data is limited. The performance of the resulting Encoder
Block trained on UNSW-NB15 dataset has also been tested on other datasets for
representation extraction which shows competitive results in downstream tasks.

graph classification tasks, especially due to pooling operators, which
aggregate learned node embeddings hierarchically into a final graph
representation. However, they are not only questioned by recent work showing on
par performance with random pooling, but also ignore completely higher-order
connectivity patterns. To tackle this issue, we propose HoscPool, a
clustering-based graph pooling operator that captures higher-order information
hierarchically, leading to richer graph representations. In fact, we learn a
probabilistic cluster assignment matrix end-to-end by minimising relaxed
formulations of motif spectral clustering in our objective function, and we
then extend it to a pooling operator. We evaluate HoscPool on graph
classification tasks and its clustering component on graphs with ground-truth
community structure, achieving best performance. Lastly, we provide a deep
empirical analysis of pooling operators' inner functioning.

crucial feature of the spatial planning of cities. By 2050 urban mobility will
be one of the biggest confronts for global cities. This study has been carried
out to assess the ratio of public space allocated to the streets in some cities
of Bangladesh. The length, width, area, and number of street crossings have
been counted for the city core and its suburban area as an indicator of the
form and pattern of the street layout. This exercise does not consider the rest
of the public spaces, like gardens and general public spaces for amenities,
including sports. The methodology of data collection has been through Google
Earth and GIS software. For precise results, other more sophisticated software
is essential. Nevertheless, even at these levels of precision, very interesting
city patterns emerge. The findings of this study show that Bogra, Rangpur, and
Dinajpur are better cities having higher land allocation rates for streets,
including sufficient crossings. Nilphamari and Thakurgaon have lower land areas
for roads; tend to have lower connectivity and productivity. The rest of the
cities have an average land area for roads and an average number of street
crossings.

of the parameter and then calculate the expectation of the estimated value to
get the E-Bayesian estimation. To measure the estimated error, the E-MSE
(expected mean squared error) is introduced. And the formulas of E-Bayesian
estimation and E-MSE are given. By applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo
technology, we analyze the performances of the proposed methods. Results are
compared on the basis of E-MSE. Then, cases of samples in real data sets are
presented for illustration. In order to test whether the Lomax distribution can
be used in analyzing the datasets, Kolmogorov Smirnov tests are conducted.
Using real data, we can get the maximum likelihood estimation at the same time
and compare it with E-Bayesian estimation. At last, we get the results of the
comparison between Bayesian and E-Bayesian estimation methods under three
different loss functions.

The momentum and angular momentum density expressions are generally obtained
from the energy-momentum tensor, in turn obtained from a Lagrangian. The
electrodynamic expressions obtained by the canonical procedure are not the same
as the symmetric Belinfante reworking. For the interaction of matter with
structured light, for example, twisted photons, this is important; there are
drastically different predictions for forces and angular momenta induced on
small test objects. We show situations where the two predictions can be

different as it involves large number of linear, nonlinear and non-convex type
equality and inequality constraints. In this work a 57 real-world constrained
optimization problems test suite is solved using two constrained metaheuristic
algorithms originated from a socio-based Cohort Intelligence (CI) algorithm.
The first CI-based algorithm incorporates a self-adaptive penalty function
approach i.e., CI-SAPF. The second algorithm combines CI-SAPF with the
intrinsic properties of the physics-based Colliding Bodies Optimization (CBO)
referred to CI-SAPF-CBO. The results obtained from CI-SAPF and CI-SAPF-CBO are
compared with other constrained optimization algorithms. The superiority of the
proposed algorithms is discussed in details followed by future directions to
