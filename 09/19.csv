machine learning models in real-world settings. In this paper, we observe that
the singular value distributions of the in-distribution (ID) and OOD features
are quite different: the OOD feature matrix tends to have a larger dominant
singular value than the ID feature, and the class predictions of OOD samples
are largely determined by it. This observation motivates us to propose
\texttt{RankFeat}, a simple yet effective \texttt{post hoc} approach for OOD
detection by removing the rank-1 matrix composed of the largest singular value
and the associated singular vectors from the high-level feature (\emph{i.e.,}
$\mathbf{X}{-} \mathbf{s}_{1}\mathbf{u}_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}$).
\texttt{RankFeat} achieves the \emph{state-of-the-art} performance and reduces
the average false positive rate (FPR95) by 17.90\% compared with the previous
best method. Extensive ablation studies and comprehensive theoretical analyses
are presented to support the empirical results.

survey how STAR-RIS affects the performance of full-duplex communication
systems with the presence of full-duplex users, wherein the base station (BS)
and the uplink users are subject to maximum transmission power constraints.
Firstly, the weighted sum-rate (WSR) is derived as a system performance metric.
Then, we formulate the resource allocation design into an equivalent weighted
minimum mean-square-error form and then transform it into several convex
sub-problems to maximize the WSR as an optimization problem which jointly
optimizes the beamforming and the combining vectors at the BS, the transmit
powers of the uplink users, and phase shifts of STAR-RIS. Although the WSR
optimization is non-convex, an efficient iterative alternating procedure is
proposed to achieve a sub-optimal solution for the optimization problem.
Secondly, the STAR-RIS's phase shifts are optimized via the successive convex
approximation technique. Finally, numerical results are provided to explain how
STAR-RIS improves the performance metric with the presence of full-duplex

temporal resolution and dynamic range. They have received increasing research
interest due to their robustness to lighting conditions and motion blur. Two
main approaches exist in the literature to feed the event-based processing
algorithms: packaging the triggered events in event packages and sending them
one-by-one as single events. These approaches suffer limitations from either
processing overflow or lack of responsivity. Processing overflow is caused by
high event generation rates when the algorithm cannot process all the events in

paper presents ASAP, an adaptive scheme to manage the event stream through
variable-size packages that accommodate to the event package processing times.
The experimental results show that ASAP is capable of feeding an asynchronous

technology that can sequence long fragments of a genome into raw electrical

basecalling, translates the raw electrical signals into nucleotide bases (i.e.,
A, C, G, T). The second step, read mapping, finds the correct location of a
read in a reference genome. In existing genome analysis pipelines, basecalling
and read mapping are executed separately. We observe in this work that such
separate execution of the two most time-consuming steps inherently leads to (1)
significant data movement and (2) redundant computations on the data, slowing
down the genome analysis pipeline. This paper proposes GenPIP, an in-memory

two key mechanisms: (1) in-memory fine-grained collaborative execution of the
major genome analysis steps in parallel; (2) a new technique for
early-rejection of low-quality and unmapped reads to timely stop the execution
of genome analysis for such reads, reducing inefficient computation. Our

GenPIP provides 41.6X (8.4X) speedup and 32.8X (20.8X) energy savings with
negligible accuracy loss compared to the state-of-the-art software genome

evolving high-performing solutions, shares them with users to receive feedback,
and applies them back to the optimization process to improve its effectiveness.
The knowledge extraction process uses a systematic and elegant graph analysis
method which scales well with number of variables. The working of the proposed
IK-EMO is demonstrated on three large-scale real-world engineering design

to account for the dark matter we propose a hybrid scoto-seesaw model based on
the $A_4$ discrete flavor symmetry. In this setup, including at least two heavy
right-handed neutrinos is essential to employ the discrete flavor symmetry that
mimics once popular tribimaximal neutrino mixing at the leading order via
type-I seesaw. The scotogenic contribution then acts as a critical deviation to
reproduce the observed value of the reactor mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ (within
the trimaximal mixing scheme) and to accommodate potential dark matter
candidates, pointing towards a common origin of $\theta_{13}$ and dark matter.
The model predicts the atmospheric angle to be in the upper octant, excludes
some regions on the Dirac CP phase, and restricts the Majorana phases too.
Further, normal and inverted mass hierarchies can be distinguished for specific
values of the relative phases associated with the complex light neutrino mass
matrix. Owing to the considered flavor symmetry, contributions coming from the
scotogenic mechanism towards the lepton flavor violating decays such as $\mu
\rightarrow e \gamma$, $\tau \rightarrow e \gamma$ vanish, and a lower limit on
the second right-handed neutrino mass can be obtained. Prediction for the
effective mass parameter appearing in the neutrinoless double beta decay falls
within the sensitivity of future experiments such as LEGEND-1k and nEXO.

constructed system model is independent from the initial condition and the task

promises orders of energy and throughput improvements for deep learning
inference. Leveraging the massively parallel and efficient analog computing
inside memories, PIM circumvents the bottlenecks of data movements in
conventional digital hardware. However, an extra quantization step (i.e. PIM
quantization), typically with limited resolution due to hardware constraints,
is required to convert the analog computing results into digital domain.
Meanwhile, non-ideal effects extensively exist in PIM quantization because of
the imperfect analog-to-digital interface, which further compromises the
inference accuracy.
  In this paper, we propose a method for training quantized networks to
incorporate PIM quantization, which is ubiquitous to all PIM systems.
Specifically, we propose a PIM quantization aware training (PIM-QAT) algorithm,
and introduce rescaling techniques during backward and forward propagation by
analyzing the training dynamics to facilitate training convergence. We also
propose two techniques, namely batch normalization (BN) calibration and
adjusted precision training, to suppress the adverse effects of non-ideal
linearity and stochastic thermal noise involved in real PIM chips. Our method
is validated on three mainstream PIM decomposition schemes, and physically on a
prototype chip. Comparing with directly deploying conventionally trained
quantized model on PIM systems, which does not take into account this extra
quantization step and thus fails, our method provides significant improvement.
It also achieves comparable inference accuracy on PIM systems as that of
conventionally quantized models on digital hardware, across CIFAR10 and
CIFAR100 datasets using various network depths for the most popular network
topology.

at each time-step, without taking into account any temporal state evolution, it
is suitable for dealing with local disturbances. However, its limitation lies
in the handling of situations that require non-quadratic objectives to achieve
a specific goal, as well as situations where countering the control disturbance
would require a locally suboptimal action. Recent works address this
shortcoming by exploiting Finite State Machines (FSMs) to compose the tasks in
such a way that the robot does not get stuck in local minima. Nevertheless, the
intrinsic trade-off between reactivity and modularity that characterizes FSMs
makes them impractical for defining reactive behaviors in dynamic environments.
In this letter, we combine the SoT control strategy with Behavior Trees (BTs),
a task switching structure that addresses some of the limitations of the FSMs
in terms of reactivity, modularity and re-usability. Experimental results on a

develop an optimization algorithm for coupled adiabatic waveguide structures,
and use it to design individual, single-cutoff spectral filters. These
single-cutoff filters are 1x2 port devices that optimally separate a broadband
signal into short-pass and long-pass outputs, within a specified device length.
We control the power roll-off and extinction ratio in these filters using the

making it possible to cascade multiple filters in different configurations.
Taking advantage of this flexibility, we cascade two filters with different
cutoff wavelengths on-chip, and experimentally demonstrate band-pass operation.
The independent and flexible design of these band edges enables filters with
bandwidths well over 100 nm. Experimentally, we demonstrate band-pass filters

probability is due to the fact that the same macrostate can be realized in

and the result is the Born rule. This works only if the basis is continuous,
but all known physically realistic measurements involve a continuous basis,
because they are based eventually on distinguishing positions. The continuous
basis is not unique, and for subsystems it depends on the observable. But for
the entire universe, there are continuous bases that give the Born rule for all
measurements, because all measurements reduce to distinguishing macroscopic
pointer states, and macroscopic observations commute. This allows for the
possibility of an ontic basis for the entire universe. In the wavefunctional
formulation, the basis can be chosen to consist of classical field
configurations, and the coefficients $\Psi[\phi]$ can be made real by absorbing

to explore the geometric properties of the representation manifolds learned by

macro-scales. Macrostates, including measuring devices, appear classical. The
distribution of space geometries automatically gives the Born rule. The
dissociation entails a kind of absolute decoherence, making the ad-hoc

  Layer Caching",,,,,"cs.LG cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become an essential component in many
application domains including web-based services. A variety of these services
require high throughput and (close to) real-time features, for instance, to
respond or react to users' requests or to process a stream of incoming data on
time. However, the trend in DNN design is toward larger models with many layers
and parameters to achieve more accurate results. Although these models are
often pre-trained, the computational complexity in such large models can still
be relatively significant, hindering low inference latency. Implementing a
caching mechanism is a typical systems engineering solution for speeding up a
service response time. However, traditional caching is often not suitable for
DNN-based services. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end automated solution
to improve the performance of DNN-based services in terms of their
computational complexity and inference latency. Our caching method adopts the
ideas of self-distillation of DNN models and early exits. The proposed solution
is an automated online layer caching mechanism that allows early exiting of a
large model during inference time if the cache model in one of the early exits
is confident enough for final prediction. One of the main contributions of this
paper is that we have implemented the idea as an online caching, meaning that
the cache models do not need access to training data and perform solely based
on the incoming data at run-time, making it suitable for applications using
pre-trained models. Our experiments results on two downstream tasks (face and
object classification) show that, on average, caching can reduce the
computational complexity of those services up to 58\% (in terms of FLOPs count)
and improve their inference latency up to 46\% with low to zero reduction in
accuracy.

effective models for many relevant data generating processes. Statistical
theory on neural networks indicates graceful scaling of sample complexity. For
example, Joen & Van Roy (arXiv:2203.00246) demonstrate that, when data is

needs only $\tilde{O}(W/\epsilon)$ samples to attain expected error $\epsilon$.
However, existing computational theory suggests that, even for
single-hidden-layer teacher networks, to attain small error for all such
teacher networks, the computation required to achieve this sample complexity is
intractable. In this work, we fit single-hidden-layer neural networks to data
generated by single-hidden-layer ReLU teacher networks with parameters drawn
from a natural distribution. We demonstrate that stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) with automated width selection attains small expected error with a number

underwater, concentric surface waves inevitably propagate. Except for possibly
early times of the impact, finite amplitude concentric water waves emerge from
a balance between dispersion or nonlinearity resulting in solitary waves. While
stability of plane solitary waves on deep and shallow water has been
extensively studied, there are no analogous analyses for concentric solitary
waves. On shallow water, the equation governing soliton formation -- the nearly
concentric Korteweg-de Vries -- has been deduced before without surface
tension, so we extend the derivation onto the surface tension case. On deep
water, the envelope equation is traditionally thought to be the nonlinear
Schr\""{o}dinger type originally derived in the Cartesian coordinates. However,
with a systematic derivation in cylindrical coordinates suitable for studying
concentric waves we demonstrate that the appropriate envelope equation must be
amended with an inverse-square potential, thus leading to a Gross-Pitaevskii
equation instead.
  Properties of both models for deep and shallow water cases are studied in
detail, including conservation laws and the base states corresponding to
axisymmetric solitary waves. Stability analyses of the latter lead to singular
eigenvalue problems, which dictate the use of analytical tools. We identify the
conditions resulting in the transverse instability of the concentric solitons
revealing crucial differences from their plane counterparts. Of particular
interest here are the effects of surface tension and cylindrical geometry on
the occurrence of transverse instability.

orbiting clumps of gas or stars. Here we interpret core formation in a
hydrodynamic simulation in terms of a theoretical formulation, which may be
considered a generalisation of Chandrasekhar's theory of two body relaxation to
the case when the density fluctuations do not arise from white noise; it
presents a simple characterisation of the effects of complex hydrodynamics and
`subgrid physics'. The power spectrum of gaseous fluctuations is found to
follow a power law over a range of scales, appropriate for a fully turbulent
compressible medium. The potential fluctuations leading to core formation are
nearly normally distributed, which allows for the energy transfer leading to
core formation to be described as a standard diffusion process, initially
increasing the velocity dispersion of test particles as in Chandrasekhar's
theory. We calculate the energy transfer from the fluctuating gas to the halo
and find it consistent with theoretical expectations. We also examine how the
initial kinetic energy input to halo particles is redistributed to form a core.
The temporal mass decrease inside the forming core may be fit by an exponential
form; a simple prescription based on our model associates the characteristic
timescale with an energy relaxation time. We compare the resulting theoretical
density distribution with that in the simulation.

being turned ON during the day and OFF in the evening, which is regrettable
even in the twenty-first century. These issues require automated streetlight
control in order to be resolved. This study aims to develop a novel streetlight
controlling method by combining a smart transport monitoring system powered by
computer vision technology with a closed circuit television (CCTV) camera that
allows the light-emitting diode (LED) streetlight to automatically light up
with the appropriate brightness by detecting the presence of pedestrians or
vehicles and dimming the streetlight in their absence using semantic image
segmentation from the CCTV video streaming. Consequently, our model
distinguishes daylight and nighttime, which made it feasible to automate the
process of turning the streetlight 'ON' and 'OFF' to save energy consumption
costs. According to the aforementioned approach, geolocation sensor data could
be utilized to make more informed streetlight management decisions. To complete
the tasks, we consider training the U-net model with ResNet-34 as its backbone.
The validity of the models is guaranteed with the use of assessment matrices.

central galaxy and lower mass systems like satellite galaxies or globular
clusters. For the Local Group, many diffuse substructures have been identified
and their link to the galaxy evolution has been traced. However it cannot be
assumed that the Milky Way or M31 are representative of their galaxy class, and
a larger sample of analogue galaxies beyond the Local Group is required to be
able to generalise the underlying theory.
  Aims. We want to characterise photometrically the stellar streams around
Milky Way analogues in the local Universe with the goal to deepen our
understanding of the interaction between host and satellite galaxies, and
ultimately of the galaxy formation and evolution processes.
  Methods. In the present work we identified and analysed stellar tidal streams
around Milky Way analogue galaxies from the SAGA sample, using deep images of
the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (for this sample, we obtain a range of r-band
surface brightness limit between 27.8 and 29 mag / arcsec2). We measure the
surface brightness and colours of the detected streams using GNU Astronomy
Utilities software.
  Results. We identified 16 new stellar tidal streams around Milky Way analogue
galaxies at distances between 25 and 40 Mpc. Applying statistical analysis to
our findings for the SAGA II galaxy sample, we obtained a frequency of 12.2%
+/- 2.4% for stellar streams. We measured surface brightness and colours of the
detected streams, and the comparison to the dwarf satellite galaxies population
around galaxies belonging to the same SAGA sample shows that the mean colour of
the streams is 0.20 mag redder than that of the SAGA satellites; also, the
streams are, in average, 0.057 +/- 0.021 mag redder that their progenitor, for
those cases when a likely progenitor could be identified.

  The first result of the paper is a complete characterization of the
hereditary families of graphs that are strongly persistent as precisely those
that are closed under substitutions. In fact, we prove an analogous
characterization for the natural extension of these properties to structures in
finite relational languages.
  We call graphons (or more generally theons) with the self-similarity property
above weakly random. Weak randomness can be seen as a weakening of graph
quasirandomness: while the latter requires densities of any finite graph to be
the same in any subgraphon, the former only requires the set of finite graphs
with positive density to be invariant across subgraphons. A hereditary family
$\mathcal{F}$ is said to have the weakly random Erd\H{o}s--Hajnal property (WR)
if every graphon that is a limit of graphs in $\mathcal{F}$ has a weakly random
subgraphon; this includes as a special case the approximate Erd\H{o}s--Hajnal
property (AEHP), where the subgraphon is required to be an almost clique or
almost anti-clique. Among families of graphs that are closed under
substitutions, we completely characterize the families that belong to WR as
those with ""few"" prime graphs.
  The classes AEHP and WR can be seen as measuring the complexity of hereditary
families in terms of structural variation in their limit objects (here
specifically in terms of unavoidable sub-objects), and this work can be seen as
initiating a classification theory for hereditary families of finite
structures.

that the linear modes of this model support the sound waves only. However, when
the background has constant vorticity, then the model admits instability and

relatively inefficient tunneling transport at junctions between CNTs and the
low density of conducting channels through the networks. In this work, we
demonstrate that significant enhancement of power factor is possible by adding
electrically insulating microscale particles in CNT networks. When silica
particles of a few micrometer diameters were co-embedded in single-walled
CNT-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composites, both the electrical conductivity
and the Seebeck coefficient were simultaneously enhanced, thereby boosting the
power factor by more than a factor of six. We find that the silica
microparticles excluded a large volume of the composite from the access of CNTs
and caused CNT networks to form around them using the polymer as a binder,
which in turn resulted in improved connectivity and alignment of CNTs. Our
theoretical calculations based on junction tunneling transport show that the
large power factor enhancement can be attributed to the enhanced tunneling with
reduced junction distance between CNTs and the increased geometric factor due
to better CNT alignment. Additional enhancement of power factor by more than a
factor of two was achieved by sample compression due to the further improvement
of CNT alignment.

require combining evidence from multiple different aspects (what we term

and a common practice is to assign the task to multiple evaluators in a

relative location between the ECF and flame front, i.e., homogeneous and
heterogeneous spray flames. An element-based equivalence ratio (ER) at the
flame front (flame ER for short) is introduced to measure the gas composition
in evaporating sprays. For overall fuel-lean mixtures, quasi-stationary
spherical flame (QSSF) occurs due to lean flame ER and the composition at the
QSSF front is homogeneous. For overall fuel-rich two-phase mixtures,
re-ignition, after the spark-ignited kernel fails, is observed when the droplet
diameter is 15 {\mu}m for fuel sprays with both fuel-lean and fuel-rich
background gas. This is due to rich flame ER and/or strong evaporative heat
loss. Meanwhile, the kernel is born in a heterogeneous mixture and transition
into homogeneous state is found. For both overall lean and rich two-phase
mixtures, fuel droplets affect the ignitability and flame trajectories.
Moreover, ignition energy affects the flame ER and front distance at the early
stage of kernel development. Lastly, the minimum ignition energies (MIE) with
different gas and overall ERs are investigated.

in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, where direct deployment is often
infeasible, unethical, or expensive. When deployment environments are expected
to undergo changes (that is, dataset shifts), it is important for OPE methods
to perform robust evaluation of the policies amidst such changes. Existing
approaches consider robustness against a large class of shifts that can
arbitrarily change any observable property of the environment. This often
results in highly pessimistic estimates of the utilities, thereby invalidating
policies that might have been useful in deployment. In this work, we address
the aforementioned problem by investigating how domain knowledge can help
provide more realistic estimates of the utilities of policies. We leverage
human inputs on which aspects of the environments may plausibly change, and
adapt the OPE methods to only consider shifts on these aspects. Specifically,
we propose a novel framework, Robust OPE (ROPE), which considers shifts on a
subset of covariates in the data based on user inputs, and estimates worst-case
utility under these shifts. We then develop computationally efficient
algorithms for OPE that are robust to the aforementioned shifts for contextual
bandits and Markov decision processes. We also theoretically analyze the sample
complexity of these algorithms. Extensive experimentation with synthetic and
real world datasets from the healthcare domain demonstrates that our approach
not only captures realistic dataset shifts accurately, but also results in less

architecture without convolution, Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT), as the

searches to ensure the recommendations and outcomes are sufficiently reliable.
Indeed, searching for relevant medical literature is a key phase in
constructing systematic reviews and often involves domain (medical researchers)
and search (information specialists) experts in developing the search queries.
Queries in this context are highly complex, based on Boolean logic, include
free-text terms and index terms from standardised terminologies (e.g., the
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus), and are difficult and
time-consuming to build. The use of MeSH terms, in particular, has been shown
to improve the quality of the search results. However, identifying the correct
MeSH terms to include in a query is difficult: information experts are often
unfamiliar with the MeSH database and unsure about the appropriateness of MeSH
terms for a query. Naturally, the full value of the MeSH terminology is often
not fully exploited. This article investigates methods to suggest MeSH terms
based on an initial Boolean query that includes only free-text terms. In this
context, we devise lexical and pre-trained language models based methods. These
methods promise to automatically identify highly effective MeSH terms for
inclusion in a systematic review query. Our study contributes an empirical
evaluation of several MeSH term suggestion methods. We further contribute an
extensive analysis of MeSH term suggestions for each method and how these
suggestions impact the effectiveness of Boolean queries.

$C:\Sigma^n\rightarrow \Sigma^m$ with super-fast decoding algorithms. They are
important mathematical objects in many areas of theoretical computer science,
yet the best constructions so far have codeword length $m$ that is
super-polynomial in $n$, for codes with constant query complexity and constant
alphabet size. In a very surprising result, Ben-Sasson et al. showed how to
construct a relaxed version of LDCs (RLDCs) with constant query complexity and
almost linear codeword length over the binary alphabet, and used them to obtain
significantly-improved constructions of Probabilistically Checkable Proofs. In
this work, we study RLDCs in the standard Hamming-error setting, and introduce
their variants in the insertion and deletion (Insdel) error setting. Insdel
LDCs were first studied by Ostrovsky and Paskin-Cherniavsky, and are further
motivated by recent advances in DNA random access bio-technologies, in which
the goal is to retrieve individual files from a DNA storage database. Our first
result is an exponential lower bound on the length of Hamming RLDCs making 2
queries, over the binary alphabet. This answers a question explicitly raised by
Gur and Lachish. Our result exhibits a ""phase-transition""-type behavior on the
codeword length for constant-query Hamming RLDCs. We further define two
variants of RLDCs in the Insdel-error setting, a weak and a strong version. On
the one hand, we construct weak Insdel RLDCs with with parameters matching
those of the Hamming variants. On the other hand, we prove exponential lower
bounds for strong Insdel RLDCs. These results demonstrate that, while these
variants are equivalent in the Hamming setting, they are significantly
different in the insdel setting. Our results also prove a strict separation
between Hamming RLDCs and Insdel RLDCs.

estimation. Plant monitoring with high temporal and spatial resolution is
important to both farmers and researchers to detect anomalies and develop
predictive models for plant growth. The availability of high-quality,
off-the-shelf structure-from-motion (SfM) and photogrammetry packages has
enabled a vibrant community of roboticists to apply computer vision for
non-destructive plant monitoring. While existing approaches tend to focus on
either high-throughput (e.g. satellite, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),
vehicle-mounted, conveyor-belt imagery) or high-accuracy/robustness to
occlusions (e.g. turn-table scanner or robot arm), we propose a middle-ground
that achieves high accuracy with a medium-throughput, highly automated robot.
Our design pairs the workspace scalability of a cable-driven parallel robot
(CDPR) with the dexterity of a 4 degree-of-freedom (DoF) robot arm to
autonomously image many plants from a variety of viewpoints. We describe our
robot design and demonstrate it experimentally by collecting daily photographs
of 54 plants from 64 viewpoints each. We show that our approach can produce
scientifically useful measurements, operate fully autonomously after initial
calibration, and produce better reconstructions and plant property estimates
than those of over-canopy methods (e.g. UAV). As example applications, we show
that our system can successfully estimate plant mass with a Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.586g and, when used to perform hypothesis testing on the
relationship between mass and age, produces p-values comparable to ground-truth

the measurable two-point correlator in the presence of environmental noise,
quantum projection noise, and readout noise. We show that optimizing the

an open quest in biomedical optical imaging. Although pure optical imaging
techniques offer rich optical contrast of blood and have been reported to
measure blood flow, they are generally limited to surface imaging within the
optical diffusion limit of about one millimeter. Herein, we present
photoacoustic vector tomography (PAVT), breaking through the optical diffusion
limit to image deep blood flow with speed and direction quantification. PAVT
synergizes the spatial heterogeneity of blood and the photoacoustic contrast;
it compiles successive single-shot, wide-field photoacoustic images to directly
visualize the frame-to-frame propagation of the blood with pixel-wise flow
velocity estimation. We demonstrated in vivo that PAVT allows hemodynamic
quantification of deep blood vessels at five times the optical diffusion limit
(more than five millimeters), leading to vector mapping of blood flow in
humans. By offering the capability for deep hemodynamic imaging with optical
contrast, PAVT may become a powerful tool for monitoring and diagnosing
vascular diseases and mapping circulatory system function.

motivate drivers to route and sample diverse paths, this paper is the first to
propose online pricing for a provider to economically reward drivers for
diverse routing and control the actual AoI dynamics over time and spatial path

knowing drivers' costs and even arrivals, and is intractable due to the curse
of dimensionality in both time and space. If there is only one non-shortest

long-standing problem in hydrodynamics and hydrology. Until now, conventional
numerical models based on Saint-Venant equations are the dominant approaches.
Here we show that a machine learning model that is well-trained on a minimal
amount of data, can help predict the long-term dynamic behavior of a
one-dimensional dam-break flood with satisfactory accuracy. For this purpose,
we solve the Saint-Venant equations for a one-dimensional dam-break flood
scenario using the Lax-Wendroff numerical scheme and train the reservoir
computing echo state network (RC-ESN) with the dataset by the simulation
results consisting of time-sequence flow depths. We demonstrate a good
prediction ability of the RC-ESN model, which ahead predicts wave propagation
behavior 286 time-steps in the dam-break flood with a root mean square error
(RMSE) smaller than 0.01, outperforming the conventional long short-term memory
(LSTM) model which reaches a comparable RMSE of only 81 time-steps ahead. To
show the performance of the RC-ESN model, we also provide a sensitivity
analysis of the prediction accuracy concerning the key parameters including
training set size, reservoir size, and spectral radius. Results indicate that
the RC-ESN are less dependent on the training set size, a medium reservoir size
K=1200~2600 is sufficient. We confirm that the spectral radius \r{ho} shows a
complex influence on the prediction accuracy and suggest a smaller spectral
radius \r{ho} currently. By changing the initial flow depth of the dam break,
we also obtained the conclusion that the prediction horizon of RC-ESN is larger
than that of LSTM.

encode the distribution heterogeneity by parametrizing distributions on local

convergence rates for various specific problem setups. Surprisingly, our
estimator attains the optimal rate under certain graph fidelity condition on
$G$, as if we could aggregate all samples sharing the same distribution. If the

multiple testing to ensure the optimality. To ease the burden of local

convergence rate $O(T^{-1}\log T)$ where $T$ denotes the number of iterations.
We highlight that, our algorithm transmits only parameters along edges of $G$

latent posterior density. However, the NCE typically fails to accurately
estimate such density ratio given large gap between two densities. To
effectively tackle this issue and learn more expressive prior models, we
develop the adaptive multi-stage density ratio estimation which breaks the
estimation into multiple stages and learn different stages of density ratio
sequentially and adaptively. The latent prior model can be gradually learned
using ratio estimated in previous stage so that the final latent space EBM
prior can be naturally formed by product of ratios in different stages. The
proposed method enables informative and much sharper prior than existing
baselines, and can be trained efficiently. Our experiments demonstrate strong

consistency and 3D point cloud consistency. However, they are very vulnerable
to illumination variance, occlusions, texture-less regions, as well as moving
objects, making them not robust enough to deal with various scenes. To address
this challenge, we study two kinds of robust cross-view consistency in this
paper. Firstly, the spatial offset field between adjacent frames is obtained by
reconstructing the reference frame from its neighbors via deformable alignment,
which is used to align the temporal depth features via a Depth Feature
Alignment (DFA) loss. Secondly, the 3D point clouds of each reference frame and
its nearby frames are calculated and transformed into voxel space, where the
point density in each voxel is calculated and aligned via a Voxel Density
Alignment (VDA) loss. In this way, we exploit the temporal coherence in both
depth feature space and 3D voxel space for SS-MDE, shifting the
""point-to-point"" alignment paradigm to the ""region-to-region"" one. Compared
with the photometric consistency loss as well as the rigid point cloud

  Spacetimes","115 pages, 1 figure (shortened abstract; full abstract in paper)",,,,"gr-qc hep-th math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For Euclidean quantum field theories, Holland and Hollands have shown
operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients satisfy ""flow equations"": For
interaction parameter $\lambda$, the partial derivative of any OPE coefficient
with respect to $\lambda$ is given by an integral over Euclidean space of a sum
of products of other OPE coefficients. In this paper, we generalize these
results for flat Euclidean space to curved Lorentzian spacetimes in the context
of the solvable ""toy model"" of massive Klein-Gordon scalar field theory, with
$m^2$ viewed as the ""self-interaction parameter"". Even in Minkowski spacetime,
a serious difficulty arises from the fact that all integrals must be taken over
a compact spacetime region to ensure convergence but any integration cutoff
necessarily breaks Lorentz covariance. We show how covariant flow relations can
be obtained by adding compensating ""counterterms"" in a manner similar to that
of the Epstein-Glaser renormalization scheme. We also show how to eliminate
dependence on the ""infrared-cutoff scale"" $L$, thereby yielding flow relations
compatible with almost homogeneous scaling of the fields. In curved spacetime,
the spacetime integration will cause the OPE coefficients to depend non-locally
on the spacetime metric, in violation of the requirement that quantum fields
should depend locally and covariantly on the metric. We show how this
potentially serious difficulty can be overcome by replacing the metric with a
suitable local polynomial approximation about the OPE expansion point. We
thereby obtain local and covariant flow relations for the OPE coefficients of
Klein-Gordon theory in curved Lorentzian spacetimes. In an appendix, we develop
an algorithm for constructing local and covariant flow relations beyond our
""toy model"" based on the associativity properties of OPE coefficients, and we
apply our method to $\lambda\phi^4$-theory.

for constraining fundamental physics such as the sum of neutrino masses and the
dark energy equation of state. Current lensing measurements primarily come from
distortions to the microwave background temperature field, but the polarization
lensing signal will dominate upcoming experiments with greater sensitivity.
Cosmic birefringence refers to the rotation of the linear polarization
direction of microwave photons propagating from the last scattering surface to
us, which can be induced by parity-violating physics such as axion-like dark
matter or primordial magnetic fields. We find that, for an upcoming CMB-S4-like
experiment, if there exists the scale-invariant anisotropic birefringence with
an amplitude corresponding to the current $95\%$ upper bound, the measured
lensing power spectrum could be biased by up to a factor of few at small
scales, $L\gtrsim 1000$. We show that the bias scales linearly with the
amplitude of the scale-invariant birefringence spectrum. The signal-to-noise of
the contribution from anisotropic birefringence is larger than unity even if
the birefringence amplitude decreases to $\sim 5\%$ of the current upper bound.
Our results indicate that a measurement and characterization of the anisotropic
birefringence is important for lensing analysis in future low-noise
polarization experiments.

systems as these entail a combination of background knowledge, reasoning and

and perform deductive reasoning, they are sensitive to noise and require inputs
be mapped to preset symbolic features. Connectionist systems on the other hand
can directly ingest rich input spaces such as images, text or speech and
recognize pattern even with noisy inputs. However, connectionist models
struggle to include explicit domain knowledge for deductive reasoning. In this
paper, we propose a framework that combines the pattern recognition abilities
of neural networks with symbolic reasoning and background knowledge for solving
a class of Analogical Reasoning problems where the set of attributes and
possible relations across them are known apriori. We take inspiration from the
'neural algorithmic reasoning' approach [DeepMind 2020] and use
problem-specific background knowledge by (i) learning a distributed
representation based on a symbolic model of the problem (ii) training
neural-network transformations reflective of the relations involved in the
problem and finally (iii) training a neural network encoder from images to the
distributed representation in (i). These three elements enable us to perform
search-based reasoning using neural networks as elementary functions
manipulating distributed representations. We test this on visual analogy
problems in RAVENs Progressive Matrices, and achieve accuracy competitive with
human performance and, in certain cases, superior to initial end-to-end
neural-network based approaches. While recent neural models trained at scale
yield SOTA, our novel neuro-symbolic reasoning approach is a promising
direction for this problem, and is arguably more general, especially for
problems where domain knowledge is available.

  Learning-to-Rank","Accepted by NeurIPS 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In learning-to-rank problems, a privileged feature is one that is available
during model training, but not available at test time. Such features naturally
arise in merchandised recommendation systems; for instance, ""user clicked this
item"" as a feature is predictive of ""user purchased this item"" in the offline
data, but is clearly not available during online serving. Another source of
privileged features is those that are too expensive to compute online but
feasible to be added offline. Privileged features distillation (PFD) refers to
a natural idea: train a ""teacher"" model using all features (including
privileged ones) and then use it to train a ""student"" model that does not use
the privileged features.
  In this paper, we first study PFD empirically on three public ranking
datasets and an industrial-scale ranking problem derived from Amazon's logs. We
show that PFD outperforms several baselines (no-distillation,
pretraining-finetuning, self-distillation, and generalized distillation) on all
these datasets. Next, we analyze why and when PFD performs well via both
empirical ablation studies and theoretical analysis for linear models. Both
investigations uncover an interesting non-monotone behavior: as the predictive
power of a privileged feature increases, the performance of the resulting
student model initially increases but then decreases. We show the reason for
the later decreasing performance is that a very predictive privileged teacher
produces predictions with high variance, which lead to high variance student
estimates and inferior testing performance.

(generalizing or transporting) causal inferences from a trial to a target
population. In many generalizability and transportability analyses, the trial
and the observational data from the target population are separately sampled,
following a non-nested trial design. In practical implementations of this
design, non-randomized individuals from the target population are often
identified by conditioning on the use of a particular treatment, while
individuals who used other candidate treatments for the same indication or
individuals who did not use any treatment are excluded. In this paper, we argue
that conditioning on treatment in the target population changes the estimand of
generalizability and transportability analyses and potentially introduces
serious bias in the estimation of causal estimands in the target population or
the subset of the target population using a specific treatment. Furthermore, we
argue that the naive application of marginalization-based or weighting-based

cases. Popular models for rate-independent dissipation are hysteresis models;
and a highly popular hysteresis model is the Bouc-Wen model. If such hysteretic
dissipation is incorporated in a refined finite element model, then the
mathematical model includes the usual structural dynamics equations along with
nonlinear nonsmooth ordinary differential equations for a large number of
internal hysteretic states at Gauss points, to be used within the virtual work
calculation for dissipation. For such systems, numerical integration becomes
difficult due to both the distributed non-analytic nonlinearity of hysteresis
as well as the very high natural frequencies in the finite element model. Here
we offer two contributions. First, we present a simple semi-implicit
integration approach where the structural part is handled implicitly based on
the work of Pich\'e, and where the hysteretic part is handled explicitly. A
cantilever beam example is solved in detail using high mesh refinement.
Convergence is good for lower damping and a smoother hysteresis loop. For a
less smooth hysteresis loop and/or higher damping, convergence is observed to
be roughly linear on average. Encouragingly, the time step needed for stability
is much larger than the time period of the highest natural frequency of the
structural model. Subsequently, data from several simulations conducted using
the above semi-implicit method are used to construct reduced order models of
the system, where the structural dynamics is projected onto a small number of
modes and the number of hysteretic states is reduced significantly as well.
Convergence studies of error against the number of retained hysteretic states
show very good results.

pair potential is expected to form in a two-dimensional Fermi superfluid
subject to s-wave pairing, spin-orbit coupling and a large-enough Zeeman
splitting. Andreev bound states appear at phase boundaries, including Majorana
zero modes whose existence is assured by the bulk-boundary correspondence
principle. Here we study the physical properties of these subgap-energy bound
states at step-like interfaces using the spin-resolved Bogoliubov-deGennes
mean-field formalism and assuming small spin-orbit coupling. Extending a
recently developed spin-projection technique based on Feshbach partitioning
[SciPost Phys. 5, 016 (2018)] combined with the Andreev approximation allows us
to obtain remarkably simple analytical expressions for the bound-state energies
as well as the majority and minority spin components of their wave functions.
Besides the vacuum boundary, where a majority-spin Majorana excitation is
encountered, we also consider the boundary between the topological and a
nontopological superfluid phase that can appear in a coexistence scenario due
to the first-order topological phase transition predicted for this system. At
this superfluid-superfluid interface, we find a localized chiral Majorana mode
hosted by the minority-spin sector. Our theory further predicts majority-spin
subgap-energy bound states similar to those found at a Josephson junction
between same-chirality p-wave superfluids. Their presence affects the Majorana
mode due to a coupling of minority and majority spin sectors only in the small
energy range where their spectra overlap. Our results may inform experimental

view for abstract and commonsense concepts, and an instance view for specific
entities that are instantiated from ontological concepts. As such, these KGs
contain heterogeneous structures that are hierarchical, from the ontology-view,
and cyclical, from the instance-view. Despite these various structures in KGs,
most recent works on embedding KGs assume that the entire KG belongs to only
one of the two views but not both simultaneously. For works that seek to put
both views of the KG together, the instance and ontology views are assumed to
belong to the same geometric space, such as all nodes embedded in the same
Euclidean space or non-Euclidean product space, an assumption no longer
reasonable for two-view KGs where different portions of the graph exhibit
different structures. To address this issue, we define and construct a
dual-geometric space embedding model (DGS) that models two-view KGs using a
complex non-Euclidean geometric space, by embedding different portions of the
KG in different geometric spaces. DGS utilizes the spherical space, hyperbolic
space, and their intersecting space in a unified framework for learning
embeddings. Furthermore, for the spherical space, we propose novel closed
spherical space operators that directly operate in the spherical space without
the need for mapping to an approximate tangent space. Experiments on public
datasets show that DGS significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
baseline models on KG completion tasks, demonstrating its ability to better
model heterogeneous structures in KGs.

After nearly three decades of research, there remains a key problem unsolved,
namely, the perturbation analysis of covariance operator for diverging number
of eigencomponents obtained from noisy and discretely observed data. This is
fundamental for studying models and methods based on FPCA, while there has not
been substantial progress since Hall, M\""uller and Wang (2006)'s result for a
fixed number of eigenfunction estimates. In this work, we aim to establish a
unified theory for this problem, deriving the moment bounds of eigenfunctions
and asymptotic distributions of eigenvalues for a wide range of sampling
schemes. Our results provide insight into the phenomenon when the
$\mathcal{L}^{2}$ bound of eigenfunction estimates with diverging indices is
minimax optimal as if the curves are fully observed, and reveal the transition
of convergence rates from nonparametric to parametric regimes in connection to
sparse or dense sampling. We also propose a double truncation technique to
derive the uniform convergence (in time domain) of estimated eigenfunctions for
the first time. The technical arguments in this work are useful for handling
the perturbation series with noisy and discretely observed data and can be
applied in models or those involving inverse problems based on FPCA as
regularization, such as functional linear regression.

between entities to learn low-dimensional representations of entities and
relations. The traditional KG embedding techniques (such as TransE and

KG triplets. These approaches differ in their triplet scoring loss functions.
As these models only use the observed triplets to estimate the embeddings, they
are prone to suffer through data sparsity that usually occurs in the real-world
knowledge graphs, i.e., the lack of enough triplets per entity. To settle this
issue, we propose an efficient method to augment the number of triplets to
address the problem of data sparsity. We use random walks to create additional
triplets, such that the relations carried by these introduced triplets entail
the metapath induced by the random walks. We also provide approaches to
accurately and efficiently filter out informative metapaths from the possible

applications such as computational pathology. But, the lack of adequate
annotated data and the high spatiospectral dimensions of HSIs usually make
classification networks prone to overfit. Thus, learning a general
representation which can be transferred to the downstream tasks is imperative.
To our knowledge, no appropriate self-supervised pre-training method has been
designed for histopathology HSIs. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and
effective Self-supervised Spectral Regression (S$^3$R) method, which exploits
the low rank characteristic in the spectral domain of HSI. More concretely, we
propose to learn a set of linear coefficients that can be used to represent one
band by the remaining bands via masking out these bands. Then, the band is
restored by using the learned coefficients to reweight the remaining bands. Two
pre-text tasks are designed: (1)S$^3$R-CR, which regresses the linear
coefficients, so that the pre-trained model understands the inherent structures
of HSIs and the pathological characteristics of different morphologies;
(2)S$^3$R-BR, which regresses the missing band, making the model to learn the
holistic semantics of HSIs. Compared to prior arts i.e., contrastive learning
methods, which focuses on natural images, S$^3$R converges at least 3 times
faster, and achieves significant improvements up to 14% in accuracy when
transferring to HSI classification tasks.

establish optimal consistency rates and corresponding finite sample bounds for

typically not achieved by conventional, temporally local continuous measurement
schemes such as counting or homodyning. To address the outstanding open
challenge of efficient retrieval of the quantum Fisher information of the

temporally quasi-local measurement bases as captured by matrix product states.
Such measurement can be implemented effectively by injecting the emission field
of the sensor into an auxiliary open system, a `quantum decoder' module, which
`decodes' specific input matrix product states into simple product states as
its output field, and performing conventional continuous measurement at the
output. We devise a universal recipe for the construction of the decoder,
thereby establishing a universal method to achieve the quantum Cramer-Rao

the star formation history (SFH). The distinct peak in star formation rate
density (SFRD) and its subsequent decline are both affected by the interplay
between gravitational attraction and the accelerating effects of $\Lambda$. The
IGM cools down more rapidly in models with a larger $\Lambda$ and also with a
lower $\sigma_8$, reflecting the reduced SFRD associated with these changes --
although changing $\sigma_8$ is not degenerate with changing $\Lambda$, either
regarding the thermal history of the IGM or the SFH. However, these induced
changes to the IGM or ionizing background have little impact on the calculated
SFRD. We provide fits for the evolution of the SFRD in these different
universes, which we integrate over time to derive an asymptotic star formation
efficiency. Together with Weinberg's uniform prior on $\Lambda$, the estimated
probability of observers experiencing a value of $\Lambda$ no greater than the
observed value is 13%, substantially larger than some alternative estimates.
Within the Enzo model framework, then, observer selection within a multiverse
is able to account statistically for the small value of the cosmological
constant, although $\Lambda$ in our universe does appear to be at the low end

multi-agent systems (MAS) with input constraints and bounded time-varying
communication delays. We propose a robust distributed model predictive control
(DMPC) consensus protocol that integrates the offline consensus design with
online DMPC optimization to exploit their respective advantages. More
precisely, each agent is equipped with an offline consensus protocol, which is
a priori designed, depending on its immediate neighbors' estimated states.
Further, the estimation errors propagated over time due to inexact neighboring
information are proved bounded under mild technical assumptions, based on which
a robust DMPC strategy is deliberately designed to achieve robust consensus
while satisfying input constraints. Moreover, it is shown that, with the
suitably designed cost function and constraints, the feasibility of the
associated optimization problem can be recursively ensured. We further provide
the consensus convergence result of the constrained MAS in the presence of
bounded varying delays. Finally, two numerical examples are given to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed distributed consensus algorithm.

has been an indispensable tool in physical sciences. In the long-time limit,
the properties of these systems are characterized by stationary distributions
of chemical master equations. In this paper, we describe a novel method for
computing stationary distributions analytically, based on a parallel formalism
between stochastic chemical reaction systems and second quantization. Anderson,
Craciun, and Kurtz showed that, when the rate equation for a reaction network
admits a complex-balanced steady-state solution, the corresponding stochastic
reaction system has a stationary distribution of a product form of Poisson
distributions. In a formulation of stochastic reaction systems using the
language of second quantization initiated by Doi, product-form Poisson
distributions correspond to coherent states. Pursuing this analogy further, we
study the counterpart of squeezed states in stochastic reaction systems. Under
the action of a squeeze operator, the time-evolution operator of the chemical
master equation is transformed, and the resulting system describes a different
reaction network, which does not admit a complex-balanced steady state. A
squeezed coherent state gives the stationary distribution of the transformed
network, for which analytic expression is obtained.

existing face representations pursue the bandwidth of handling scale variation
via multi-scale scheme that assembles a finite series of predefined scales.
Such multi-shot scheme brings inference burden, and the predefined scales
inevitably have gap from real data. Instead, learning scale parameters from
data, and using them for one-shot feature inference, is a decent solution. To
this end, we reform the conv layer by resorting to the scale-space theory, and
achieve two-fold facilities: 1) the conv layer learns a set of scales from real
data distribution, each of which is fulfilled by a conv kernel; 2) the layer
automatically highlights the feature at the proper channel and location
corresponding to the input pattern scale and its presence. Then, we accomplish
the hierarchical scale attention by stacking the reformed layers, building a
novel style named SCale AttentioN Conv Neural Network (\textbf{SCAN-CNN}). We
apply SCAN-CNN to the face recognition task and push the frontier of SOTA
performance. The accuracy gain is more evident when the face images are blurry.
Meanwhile, as a single-shot scheme, the inference is more efficient than
multi-shot fusion. A set of tools are made to ensure the fast training of
SCAN-CNN and zero increase of inference cost compared with the plain CNN.

improvements. However, most state-of-the-art methods are kinematics-based,

Current dynamics-based methods can predict physically plausible motion but are
restricted to simple scenarios with static camera view. In this work, we
present D&D (Learning Human Dynamics from Dynamic Camera), which leverages the
laws of physics to reconstruct 3D human motion from the in-the-wild videos with
a moving camera. D&D introduces inertial force control (IFC) to explain the 3D
human motion in the non-inertial local frame by considering the inertial forces
of the dynamic camera. To learn the ground contact with limited annotations, we
develop probabilistic contact torque (PCT), which is computed by differentiable
sampling from contact probabilities and used to generate motions. The contact
state can be weakly supervised by encouraging the model to generate correct
motions. Furthermore, we propose an attentive PD controller that adjusts target
pose states using temporal information to obtain smooth and accurate pose
control. Our approach is entirely neural-based and runs without offline
optimization or simulation in physics engines. Experiments on large-scale 3D

superior performance against both state-of-the-art kinematics-based and

performance. The spurious correlations stem from three causes: (1) event-based
data collection and labeling schemes assign the same veracity label to multiple
highly similar posts from the same underlying event; (2) merging multiple data
sources spuriously relates source identities to veracity labels; and (3)
labeling bias. In this paper, we closely investigate three of the most popular

propose event-separated rumor detection as a solution to eliminate spurious

comparable to a simple neural classifier. To better address this task, we

  Reconstruction","13 pages, 11 figures",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Parallel imaging accelerates MRI data acquisition by acquiring additional
sensitivity information with an array of receiver coils, resulting in fewer
phase encoding steps. Because of fewer data requirements than parallel imaging,
compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging (CS-MRI) has gained popularity in
the field of medical imaging. Parallel imaging and compressed sensing (CS) both
reduce the amount of data captured in the k-space, which speeds up traditional
MRI acquisition. As acquisition time is inversely proportional to sample count,
forming an image from reduced k-space samples results in faster acquisition but
with aliasing artifacts. For de-aliasing the reconstructed image, this paper
proposes a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) called RECGAN-GR that is
supervised with multi-modal losses. In comparison to existing GAN networks, our
proposed method introduces a novel generator network, RemU-Net, which is
integrated with dual-domain loss functions such as weighted magnitude and phase
loss functions, as well as parallel imaging-based loss, GRAPPA consistency
loss. As refinement learning, a k-space correction block is proposed to make
the GAN network self-resistant to generating unnecessary data, which speeds up
the reconstruction process. Comprehensive results show that the proposed
RECGAN-GR not only improves the PSNR by 4 dB over GAN-based methods but also by
2 dB over conventional state-of-the-art CNN methods available in the literature
for single-coil data. The proposed work significantly improves image quality
for low-retained data, resulting in five to ten times faster acquisition.

that interventions having strong community level effects are associated to
extreme and diversified user-level reactions. Our results highlight that

localization and mapping (SLAM). However, existing LiDAR odometry tends to
match a new scan simply iteratively with previous fixed-pose scans, gradually
accumulating errors. Furthermore, as an effective joint optimization mechanism,
bundle adjustment (BA) cannot be directly introduced into real-time odometry
due to the intensive computation of large-scale global landmarks. Therefore,
this letter designs a new strategy named a landmark map for bundle adjustment
odometry (LMBAO) in LiDAR SLAM to solve these problems. First, BA-based
odometry is further developed with an active landmark maintenance strategy for
a more accurate local registration and avoiding cumulative errors.
Specifically, this paper keeps entire stable landmarks on the map instead of
just their feature points in the sliding window and deletes the landmarks
according to their active grade. Next, the sliding window length is reduced,
and marginalization is performed to retain the scans outside the window but
corresponding to active landmarks on the map, greatly simplifying the
computation and improving the real-time properties. In addition, experiments on
three challenging datasets show that our algorithm achieves real-time
performance in outdoor driving and outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM
algorithms, including Lego-LOAM and VLOM.

optimal in the $L^2(\Omega)$ norm provided that $\varrho(x)$ behaves like the

remains a challenging problem for robotic manipulation. Existing numerical
solvers are broadly applicable, but rely on local search techniques to manage
highly nonconvex objective functions. Recently, learning-based approaches have
shown promise as a means to generate fast and accurate IK results; learned
solvers can easily be integrated with other learning algorithms in end-to-end
systems. However, learning-based methods have an Achilles' heel: each robot of
interest requires a specialized model which must be trained from scratch. To
address this key shortcoming, we investigate a novel distance-geometric robot
representation coupled with a graph structure that allows us to leverage the
flexibility of graph neural networks (GNNs). We use this approach to train the
first learned generative graphical inverse kinematics (GGIK) solver that is,
crucially, ""robot-agnostic""-a single model is able to provide IK solutions for
a variety of different robots. Additionally, the generative nature of GGIK
allows the solver to produce a large number of diverse solutions in parallel
with minimal additional computation time, making it appropriate for
applications such as sampling-based motion planning. Finally, GGIK can
complement local IK solvers by providing reliable initializations. These
advantages, as well as the ability to use task-relevant priors and to
continuously improve with new data, suggest that GGIK has the potential to be a
key component of flexible, learning-based robotic manipulation systems.

  Probabilistic Models","Accepted at The IEEE conference series on Automatic Face and Gesture
  Recognition 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Modern-day surveillance systems perform person recognition using deep
learning-based face verification networks. Most state-of-the-art facial
verification systems are trained using visible spectrum images. But, acquiring
images in the visible spectrum is impractical in scenarios of low-light and
nighttime conditions, and often images are captured in an alternate domain such
as the thermal infrared domain. Facial verification in thermal images is often
performed after retrieving the corresponding visible domain images. This is a
well-established problem often known as the Thermal-to-Visible (T2V) image
translation. In this paper, we propose a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic
Model (DDPM) based solution for T2V translation specifically for facial images.
During training, the model learns the conditional distribution of visible
facial images given their corresponding thermal image through the diffusion
process. During inference, the visible domain image is obtained by starting
from Gaussian noise and performing denoising repeatedly. The existing inference
process for DDPMs is stochastic and time-consuming. Hence, we propose a novel
inference strategy for speeding up the inference time of DDPMs, specifically
for the problem of T2V image translation. We achieve the state-of-the-art
results on multiple datasets. The code and pretrained models are publically

quantum many-body systems. However, despite several efforts, an exact relation
between them remains elusive. In this work, we explore the relationship between
frustration and quantum entanglement in a physical model describing strongly
correlated ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices. In particular, we
consider the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model comprising both
nearest-neighbor ($t_{1}$) and frustrated next-nearest neighbor ($t_{2}$)
hoppings and examine how the interplay of onsite interaction ($U$) and hoppings
results in different quantum correlations dominating in the ground state of the
system. We then analyze the behavior of quantum entanglement in the model. In
particular, we compute genuine multipartite entanglement as quantified through
the generalized geometric measure and make a comparative study with bipartite
entanglement and other relevant order parameters. We observe that genuine
multipartite entanglement has a very rich behavior throughout the considered
parameter regime and frustration does not necessarily favor generating a high
amount of it. Moreover, we show that in the region with strong quantum
fluctuations, the particles remain highly delocalized in all momentum modes and
share a very low amount of both bipartite and multipartite entanglement. Our
work illustrates the necessity to give separate attention to dominating
ordering behavior and quantum entanglement in the ground state of strongly
correlated systems.

challenging task, especially when demand is time-varying, heterogeneous,
contains batches, and requires multiple types of resources for processing. In
this setting, providers decide whether to reserve portions of their capacity to
individual job classes or to offer it in a flexible manner.
Methodology/results: In collaboration with Huawei Cloud, a worldwide provider
of cloud services, we propose a heuristic policy that allocates multiple types
of resources to jobs and also satisfies their pre-specified service level
agreements (SLAs). We model the system as a multi-class queueing network with
parallel processing and multiple types of resources, where arrivals (i.e.,
virtual machines and containers) follow time-varying patterns and require at
least one unit of each resource for processing. While virtual machines leave if
they are not served immediately, containers can join a queue. We introduce a
diffusion approximation of the offered load of such system and investigate its
fidelity as compared to the observed data. Then, we develop a heuristic
approach that leverages this approximation to determine capacity levels that
satisfy probabilistic SLAs in the system with fully flexible servers.
Managerial Implications: Using a data set of cloud computing requests over a
representative 8-day period from Huawei Cloud, we show that our heuristic
policy results in a 20% capacity reduction and better service quality as
compared to a benchmark that reserves resources. In addition, we show that the
system utilization induced by our policy is superior to the benchmark, i.e., it
implies less idling of resources in most instances. Thus, our approach enables
cloud operators to both reduce costs and achieve better performance.

observations. Although classical AO system will be able to correct for
turbulence effects, they will be blind to this specific telescope induced

to reach the diffraction limit of the telescope and ultimately will represent
the main limitation of AO-assisted observation with an ELT. In this work we

security of the systems' components and data they process or store. In many
cases, so-called security-configuration guides are used as a basis for security
hardening. These guides describe secure configuration settings for components
such as operating systems and standard applications. Rigorous testing of
security-configuration guides and automated mechanisms for their implementation
and validation are necessary since erroneous implementations or checks of
hardening guides may severely impact systems' security and functionality. At
Siemens, centrally maintained security-configuration guides carry
machine-readable information specifying both the implementation and validation
of each required configuration step. The guides are maintained within git
repositories; automated pipelines generate the artifacts for implementation and
checking, e.g., PowerShell scripts for Windows, and carry out testing of these
artifacts on AWS images. This paper describes our experiences with our
DevOps-inspired approach for authoring, maintaining, and testing
security-configuration guides. We want to share these experiences to help other
organizations with their security hardening and, thus, increase their systems'
security.

To rapid recovery of program execution under power failures, the execution
states of checkpoints are backed up by NVM under power failures for embedded
systems with NVM. However, frequent checkpoints will shorten the lifetime of
the NVM and incur significant write overhead. In this paper, the technique of
checkpoint setting triggered by function calls is proposed to reduce the write
on NVM. The evaluation results show an average of 99.8% and 80.5$% reduction on
NVM backup size for stack backup, compared to the log-based method and
step-based method. In order to better achieve this, we also propose
pseudo-function calls to increase backup points to reduce recovery costs, and
exponential incremental call-based backup methods to reduce backup costs in the
loop. To further avoid the content on NVM is cluttered and out of NVM, a method
to clean the contents on the NVM that are useless for restoration is proposed.
Based on aforementioned problems and techniques, the recovery technology is
proposed, and the case is used to analyze how to recover rapidly under

use electrochemical models to derive a highly simplified regression model that

increase of the cosmological constant, a slowly spinning Kerr-de Sitter black

Interestingly, although the numerical results show that the maximum values of

Kerr-de Sitter black hole still has significant advantages when the black hole
spin is larger than 1 and the dominant reconnection $X$-point is far away from

wider ergosphere in the presence of the cosmological constant. These results
uncover the significant effects of the cosmological constant on the energy

consequence of this, and due to the conservative nature of the problem, we
adopt a finite volume elements discretization approach over a generic

in a combination of a graded mesh near the singularity and a uniform mesh where
the solution is smooth. Such a choice gives rise to Toeplitz-like
discretization matrices and thus allows a low computational cost of the
matrix-vector product and a detailed spectral analysis. The obtained spectral
information is used to develop an ad-hoc parameter free multigrid
preconditioner for GMRES, which is numerically shown to yield good convergence
results in presence of graded meshes mapped by power functions that accumulate
points near the singularity. The approximation order of the considered graded
meshes is numerically compared with the one of a certain composite mesh given
in literature that still leads to Toeplitz-like linear systems and is then
still well-suited for our multigrid method. Several numerical tests confirm
that power graded meshes result in lower approximation errors than composite
ones and that our solver has a wide range of applicability.

carrier concentration but also with separation distance. In the non-identical
case when different planes of anisotropic black phosphorus face each other,
owing to the non-monotonic characteristic of the sign-reversal effect of the
torque, the enhancement by carrier addition and intervening medium also becomes
non-monotonic with distance. In the presence of a background medium, the
non-monotonic degree of enhancement of the torque with distance is observed
even between identical slabs.

communication and sensing (JCAS). We study multibeam planar arrays for JCAS,
providing time division duplex communication and full-duplex sensing with
steerable beams. In order to have a large aperture with a narrow beamwidth in
the radiation pattern, we propose to design a sparse tiled planar array (STPA)
aperture with affordable number of phase shifters. The modular tiling and
sparse design of the array are non-convex optimization problems, however, we
exploit the fact that the more irregularity of the antenna array geometry, the
less the side lobe level. We propose to first solve the optimization by the
maximum entropy in the phase centers of tiles in the array; then we perform
sparse subarray selection leveraging the geometry of the sunflower array. While
maintaining the same spectral efficiency in the communication link as
conventional uniform planar array (CUPA), the STPA improves angle of arrival
estimation when the line-of-sight path is dominant, e.g., the STPA with 125
elements distinguishes two adjacent targets with 20$^\circ$ difference in the
proximity of boresight whereas CUPA cannot. Moreover, the STPA has a 40$\%$
shorter blockage time compared to the CUPA when a blocker moves in the
elevation angles.

applications. However, it has recently been observed that it is difficult to
generalize the performance of neural networks under the condition of
distributional shift. Several efforts have been made to identify potential
out-of-distribution inputs. Although existing literature has made significant
progress with regard to images and textual data, finance has been overlooked.
The aim of this paper is to investigate the distribution shift in the credit
scoring problem, one of the most important applications of finance. For the
potential distribution shift problem, we propose a novel two-stage model. Using
the out-of-distribution detection method, data is first separated into
confident and unconfident sets. As a second step, we utilize the domain
knowledge with a mean-variance optimization in order to provide reliable bounds
for unconfident samples. Using empirical results, we demonstrate that our model
offers reliable predictions for the vast majority of datasets. It is only a
small portion of the dataset that is inherently difficult to judge, and we
leave them to the judgment of human beings. Based on the two-stage model,
highly confident predictions have been made and potential risks associated with
the model have been significantly reduced.

sensor poses and scene geometry, which is a fundamental problem in robot
vision. This paper presents an efficient and consistent bundle adjustment
method for lidar sensors. The method employs edge and plane features to
represent the scene geometry, and directly minimizes the natural Euclidean
distance from each raw point to the respective geometry feature. A nice
property of this formulation is that the geometry features can be analytically
solved, drastically reducing the dimension of the numerical optimization. To
represent and solve the resultant optimization problem more efficiently, this
paper then proposes a novel concept {\it point clusters}, which encodes all raw
points associated to the same feature by a compact set of parameters, the {\it
point cluster coordinates}. We derive the closed-form derivatives, up to the
second order, of the BA optimization based on the point cluster coordinates and
show their theoretical properties such as the null spaces and sparsity. Based
on these theoretical results, this paper develops an efficient second-order BA
solver. Besides estimating the lidar poses, the solver also exploits the second
order information to estimate the pose uncertainty caused by measurement
noises, leading to consistent estimates of lidar poses. Moreover, thanks to the
use of point cluster, the developed solver fundamentally avoids the enumeration
of each raw point (which is very time-consuming due to the large number) in all
steps of the optimization: cost evaluation, derivatives evaluation and
uncertainty evaluation. The implementation of our method is open sourced to
benefit the robotics community and beyond.

reference measurement distance $x_m$, feedback site $x_f$ and the transverse
force $G$. We determine the benchmarks for utilizing the available information
in an output work and the optimum operating requisites for best work
extraction. Transverse bias force ($G$) tunes the entropic contribution in the
effective potential and hence the standard deviation ($\sigma$) of the
equilibrium marginal probability distribution. We recognize that the amount of
extracted work reaches a global maximum when $x_f = 2x_m$ with $x_m \sim
0.6\sigma$, irrespective of the extent of the entropic limitation. Because of
the higher loss of information during the relaxation process, the best
achievable work of a GBIE is lower in an entropic system. The feedback
regulation also bears the unidirectional passage of particles. The average
displacement increases with growing entropic control and is maximum when $x_m
\sim 0.81\sigma$. Finally, we explore the efficacy of the information engine, a
quantity that regulates the efficiency in utilizing the information acquired.
With $x_f=2x_m$, the maximum efficacy reduces with increasing entropic control
and shows a cross over from $2$ to $11/9$. We discover that the condition for
the best efficacy depends only on the confinement length scale along the
feedback direction. The broader marginal probability distribution accredits the
increased average displacement in a cycle and the lower efficacy in an
entropy-dominated system.

research topic on automatically complementing knowledge graphs. However,
evaluation of knowledge graph completion (KGC) models often ignores the
incompleteness -- facts in the test set are ranked against all unknown triplets
which may contain a large number of missing facts not included in the KG yet.
Treating all unknown triplets as false is called the closed-world assumption.
This closed-world assumption might negatively affect the fairness and
consistency of the evaluation metrics. In this paper, we study KGC evaluation
under a more realistic setting, namely the open-world assumption, where unknown
triplets are considered to include many missing facts not included in the
training or test sets. For the currently most used metrics such as mean
reciprocal rank (MRR) and Hits@K, we point out that their behavior may be
unexpected under the open-world assumption. Specifically, with not many missing
facts, their numbers show a logarithmic trend with respect to the true strength
of the model, and thus, the metric increase could be insignificant in terms of
reflecting the true model improvement. Further, considering the variance, we
show that the degradation in the reported numbers may result in incorrect
comparisons between different models, where stronger models may have lower
metric numbers. We validate the phenomenon both theoretically and
experimentally. Finally, we suggest possible causes and solutions for this
problem. Our code and data are available at

investigate the acceleration phenomenon. First, we provide a significantly
simplified proof based on precise observation and a tighter inequality for

version of phase-space representation and Lyapunov function, is proposed to
investigate the convergence behavior of the iterative sequence

equivalent to that by velocity included implicitly in the gradient, where the
only difference comes from the iterative sequence $\{y_{k}\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$
replaced by $\{x_k\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$. Finally, for the open question of whether
the gradient norm minimization of NAG has a faster rate $o(1/k^3)$, we figure

setting up a market model, finding a martingale (``fair game"") probability
measure for the model from the given asset prices, and using that probability
measure to price the derivative. When the number of underlying assets and/or
the number of market outcomes in the model is large, pricing can be
computationally demanding. We show that a variety of quantum techniques can be
applied to the pricing problem in finance, with a particular focus on
incomplete markets. We discuss three different methods that are distinct from
previous works: they do not use the quantum algorithms for Monte Carlo
estimation and they extract the martingale measure from market variables akin
to bootstrapping, a common practice among financial institutions. The first two
methods are based on a formulation of the pricing problem into a linear program
and are using respectively the quantum zero-sum game algorithm and the quantum
simplex algorithm as subroutines. For the last algorithm, we formalize a new
market assumption milder than market completeness for which quantum linear
systems solvers can be applied with the associated potential for large
speedups. As a prototype use case, we conduct numerical experiments in the
framework of the Black-Scholes-Merton model.

guarantees high embedding capacity while effectively resisting 3D steganalysis.
Specifically, we first transform vertex coordinates into integers and derive
bitplanes from them to construct the embedding domain. To better measure the
mesh distortion caused by message embedding, we propose FPD based on the most
effective sub-features of the state-of-the-art steganalytic feature set. By
improving and minimizing FPD, we can efficiently calculate the optimal
vertex-changing distribution and simultaneously preserve mesh features, such as
steganalytic and geometric features, to a certain extent. By virtue of the
optimal distribution, we adopt the Q-layered syndrome trellis coding (STC) for
practical message embedding. However, when Q varies, calculating bit
modification probability (BMP) in each layer of Q-layered will be cumbersome.
Hence, we contrapuntally design a universal and automatic BMP calculation
approach. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm outperforms most state-of-the-art 3D mesh steganographic algorithms

implements a framework that combines probabilistic and global forecasting

the counterfactual distribution outcome for the affected instances and then
contrasting it to the real outcomes. We consider the impact of Covid-19

approaches assume linear causal relations partly for simplicity and partly for
the only availability of GWAS summary data. In this work, we propose a novel
model {for transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)} to incorporate
nonlinear relationships across IVs, an exposure, and an outcome, which is
robust against violations of the valid IV assumptions and permits the use of
GWAS summary data. We decouple the estimation of a marginal causal effect and a
nonlinear transformation, where the former is estimated via sliced inverse
regression and a sparse instrumental variable regression, and the latter is
estimated by a ratio-adjusted inverse regression. On this ground, we propose an
inferential procedure. An application of the proposed method to the ADNI gene
expression data and the IGAP GWAS summary data identifies 18 causal genes
associated with Alzheimer's disease, including APOE and TOMM40, in addition to
7 other genes missed by two-stage least squares considering only linear
relationships. Our findings suggest that nonlinear modeling is required to
unleash the power of IV regression for identifying potentially nonlinear
gene-trait associations. Accompanying this paper is our Python library

have recently drawn a lot of interest from academia and the general public.
These models are capable of producing high-quality images that depict a variety
of concepts and styles when conditioned on textual descriptions. However, these
models adopt cultural characteristics associated with specific Unicode scripts
from their vast amount of training data, which may not be immediately apparent.
We show that by simply inserting single non-Latin characters in a textual
description, common models reflect cultural stereotypes and biases in their
generated images. We analyze this behavior both qualitatively and
quantitatively, and identify a model's text encoder as the root cause of the
phenomenon. Additionally, malicious users or service providers may try to
intentionally bias the image generation to create racist stereotypes by
replacing Latin characters with similarly-looking characters from non-Latin
scripts, so-called homoglyphs. To mitigate such unnoticed script attacks, we
propose a novel homoglyph unlearning method to fine-tune a text encoder, making
it robust against homoglyph manipulations.

to achieve the verifiability of the avatar's virtual identity. Second, facing
at impersonation in physical world, we construct an avatar's identity model
based on the player's biometric template and the chameleon key to realize the
verifiability of the avatar's physical identity. Finally, we design two
decentralized authentication protocols based on the avatar's identity model to
ensure the consistency of the avatar's virtual and physical identities.
Security analysis indicates that the proposed authentication framework
guarantees the consistency and traceability of avatar's identity. Simulation
experiments show that the framework not only completes the decentralized
authentication between avatars but also achieves the virtual-physical tracking.

better with the instance size and the number of clusters. In both cases, we
strengthen the bound by adding polyhedral cuts. Benefiting from a tailored
branching strategy which enforces pairwise constraints, we reduce the
complexity of the problems arising in the children nodes. For the upper bound,
instead, we present a local search procedure that exploits the solution of the
SDP relaxation solved at each node. Computational results show that the
proposed algorithm globally solves, for the first time, real-world instances of

the mass of $(M_{PBH}\le 5 M_{\odot}, M_{NS}\simeq 1.4 M_{\odot})$ will be

centres with emission energies of 2 eV which exhibit pronounced phonon
sidebands. We investigate the microscopic origin of these luminescent centres
by combining ab initio calculations with non-perturbative open quantum system
theory to study the emission and absorption properties of 26 defect
transitions. Comparing the calculated line shapes with experiments we narrow
down the microscopic origin to three carbon-based defects: $\mathrm{C_2C_B}$,
$\mathrm{C_2C_N}$, and $\mathrm{V_NC_B}$. The theoretical method developed
enables us to calculate so-called photoluminescence excitation (PLE) maps,
which show excellent agreement with our experiments. The latter resolves
higher-order phonon transitions, thereby confirming both the vibronic structure
of the optical transition and the phonon-assisted excitation mechanism with a
phonon energy 170 meV. We believe that the presented experiments and
polaron-based method accurately describe luminescent centres in hBN and will
help to identify their microscopic origin.

and provides a proof for its conclusion. As a positive application, we show the
feasible admissibility of Visser's rules in several sequent calculi for
intuitionistic modal logics, including $\mathsf{CK}$, $\mathsf{IK}$ and their
extensions by the modal axioms $T$, $B$, $4$, $5$, the modal axioms of bounded
width and depth and the propositional lax logic. On the negative side, we show
that if a strong enough intuitionistic modal logic (satisfying a mild technical

constructive sequent calculus. Consequently, no intermediate logic other than
$\mathsf{IPC}$ has a constructive sequent calculus.

volumes as a sequence of 2D slices along the direction of the photon beam,
iDoTA solves the dose prediction task as sequence modeling. The proposed model
combines a Transformer backbone routing long-range information between all
elements in the sequence, with a series of 3D convolutions extracting local
features of the data. We train iDoTA on a dataset of 1700 beam dose
distributions, using 11 clinical volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans
(from prostate, lung and head and neck cancer patients with 194-354 beams per
plan) to assess its accuracy and speed. iDoTA predicts individual photon beams

Furthermore, estimating full VMAT dose distributions in 6-12 seconds, iDoTA
achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 99.51% (2 mm, 2%) pass rate.
Offering the sub-second speed needed in online and real-time adaptive

reweighting is a normal way to handle the subpopulation shift issue by imposing
constant or adaptive sampling weights on each sample in the training dataset.
However, some recent studies have recognized that most of these approaches fail
to improve the performance over empirical risk minimization especially when
applied to over-parameterized neural networks. In this work, we propose a
simple yet practical framework, called uncertainty-aware mixup (UMIX), to
mitigate the overfitting issue in over-parameterized models by reweighting the
''mixed'' samples according to the sample uncertainty. The
training-trajectories-based uncertainty estimation is equipped in the proposed
UMIX for each sample to flexibly characterize the subpopulation distribution.
We also provide insightful theoretical analysis to verify that UMIX achieves
better generalization bounds over prior works. Further, we conduct extensive

our method both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is available at

restore the occluded part of the face first and then apply the face recognition
method. Inspired by the recent image inpainting methods, we propose an
end-to-end hybrid masked face recognition system, namely HiMFR, consisting of
three significant parts: masked face detector, face inpainting, and face
recognition. The masked face detector module applies a pretrained Vision
Transformer (ViT\_b32) to detect whether faces are covered with masked or not.
The inpainting module uses a fine-tune image inpainting model based on a
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to restore faces. Finally, the hybrid face
recognition module based on ViT with an EfficientNetB3 backbone recognizes the
faces. We have implemented and evaluated our proposed method on four different
publicly available datasets: CelebA, SSDMNV2, MAFA, {Pubfig83} with our locally
collected small dataset, namely Face5. Comprehensive experimental results show
the efficacy of the proposed HiMFR method with competitive performance. Code is

However, the optical modes of silicon nanowire waveguides and optical fibres

grating couplers, the dominant coupling method today, have limited optical
bandwidth and are naturally out-of-plane. Here we demonstrate a new method that
is low-loss, broadband, easily manufacturable, and naturally planar. We
adiabatically couple a tapering silicon nanowire waveguide to a conic
nanotapered optical fibre, measuring transmission between 2.0 and 2.2 micron
wavelength. The silicon chip is fabricated at a commercial foundry and then
post-processed to release the tapering nanowires. We estimate an optimal
per-coupler transmission of -0.48 dB (maximum; 95% confidence interval [+0.46,
-1.68] dB) and a 1-dB bandwidth of 295 nm . With automated measurements, we
quantify the device tolerance to lateral misalignment, measuring a flat

Recently, order-preserving matching was proposed to find all occurrences of a
pattern in a time series, where the pattern is a relative order (regarded as a
trend) and an occurrence is a sub-time series whose relative order coincides
with the pattern. Inspired by the order-preserving matching, the existing
order-preserving pattern (OPP) mining algorithm employs order-preserving
matching to calculate the support, which leads to low efficiency. To address
this deficiency, this paper proposes an algorithm called efficient frequent OPP
miner (EFO-Miner) to find all frequent OPPs. EFO-Miner is composed of four
parts: a pattern fusion strategy to generate candidate patterns, a matching
process for the results of sub-patterns to calculate the support of
super-patterns, a screening strategy to dynamically reduce the size of prefix
and suffix arrays, and a pruning strategy to further dynamically prune
candidate patterns. Moreover, this paper explores the order-preserving rule
(OPR) mining and proposes an algorithm called OPR-Miner to discover strong
rules from all frequent OPPs using EFO-Miner. Experimental results verify that
OPR-Miner gives better performance than other competitive algorithms. More
importantly, clustering and classification experiments further validate that
OPR-Miner achieves good performance.

network's performance (and energy efficiency) can be bound either by
computation or memory resources. The processing-in-memory (PIM) paradigm, where
computation is placed near or within memory arrays, is a viable solution to
accelerate memory-bound NNs. However, PIM architectures vary in form, where
different PIM approaches lead to different trade-offs. Our goal is to analyze,
discuss, and contrast DRAM-based PIM architectures for NN performance and
energy efficiency. To do so, we analyze three state-of-the-art PIM
architectures: (1) UPMEM, which integrates processors and DRAM arrays into a
single 2D chip; (2) Mensa, a 3D-stack-based PIM architecture tailored for edge
devices; and (3) SIMDRAM, which uses the analog principles of DRAM to execute
bit-serial operations. Our analysis reveals that PIM greatly benefits
memory-bound NNs: (1) UPMEM provides 23x the performance of a high-end GPU when
the GPU requires memory oversubscription for a general matrix-vector
multiplication kernel; (2) Mensa improves energy efficiency and throughput by
3.0x and 3.1x over the Google Edge TPU for 24 Google edge NN models; and (3)
SIMDRAM outperforms a CPU/GPU by 16.7x/1.4x for three binary NNs. We conclude
that the ideal PIM architecture for NN models depends on a model's distinct

  A modest addition of 1.8 at.% Mo had a strong effect on the microstructure

significant reduction in alloy hardness. Fe, added to achieve better

learning scenarios is yet to be explored. In this paper, we extensively
investigate the transfer performance of various types of self-supervised
methods, e.g., MoCo and SimCLR, on three downstream tasks, including semantic
segmentation, drivable area segmentation, and traffic object detection, on the
large-scale driving dataset BDD100K. We surprisingly find that their
performances are sub-optimal or even lag far behind the single-task baseline,
which may be due to the distinctions of training objectives and architectural
design lied in the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To overcome this dilemma as well
as avoid redesigning the resource-intensive pre-training stage, we propose a
simple yet effective pretrain-adapt-finetune paradigm for general multi-task
training, where the off-the-shelf pretrained models can be effectively adapted
without increasing the training overhead. During the adapt stage, we utilize
learnable multi-scale adapters to dynamically adjust the pretrained model
weights supervised by multi-task objectives while leaving the pretrained
knowledge untouched. Furthermore, we regard the vision-language pre-training
model CLIP as a strong complement to the pretrain-adapt-finetune paradigm and
propose a novel adapter named LV-Adapter, which incorporates language priors in
the multi-task model via task-specific prompting and alignment between visual

statistics, and Bayesian causal analysis. TRR is now an incorporated part of
the bug assignment process. Considering the abstraction levels of the
telecommunications stack, high-level modules are more positive while low-level
modules experienced some drawbacks. On average, TRR automatically assigns 30%
of the incoming bug reports with an accuracy of 75%. Auto-routed TRs are
resolved around 21% faster within Ericsson, and TRR has saved highly seasoned
engineers many hours of work. Indirect effects of adopting TRR include process
improvements, process awareness, increased communication, and higher job
satisfaction. TRR has saved time at Ericsson, but the adoption of automated bug

the variance of the influence martingale provides an upper bound on the

producing previously unseen combinations of skills to reach temporally extended

stabilise moduli. Such fluxes, when they thread internal dimensions, are
topological in nature and take on quantised values. This poses the puzzle as to
how they could arise in the early universe, as they cannot be turned on
incrementally. Working with string inspired models in $6$ and $8$ dimensions,
we show that there exist no-boundary solutions in which internal fluxes are
present from the creation of the universe onwards. The no-boundary proposal can
thus explain the origin of fluxes in a Kaluza-Klein context. In fact, it acts
as a selection principle since no-boundary solutions are only found to exist
when the fluxes have the right magnitude to lead to an effective potential that
is positive and flat enough for accelerated expansion. Within the range of
selected fluxes, the no-boundary wave function assigns higher probability to
smaller values of flux. Our models illustrate how cosmology can act as a filter
on a landscape of possible higher-dimensional solutions.

here the probability of accepting the final (trial) state depends on the
activation energy, not on the relative energy between the final and initial
state. This barrier height is probed on an ongoing basis, by generating
intermediate states along the path connecting the initial and trial positions.
Importantly, to calculate the activation energy, our model only requires
knowledge of the Hamiltonian without having to introduce additional input
parameters such as transition rates etc. The details of sMC are explained for
the case of a simple spin model. The comparison of its results with the ones
obtained within the frame of stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert indicates the
correctness of sMC. In our opinion, the proposed here method can be applied to
simulate other processes, for example dynamics of classical atoms and complex
fluids, diffusion, nucleation, surface adsorption and crystal growth processes.

  The main idea is to exploit the truncation of the coefficients given by
killing Lie brackets of length greater than two. Although this truncation is
brutal, it retains significant and highly non-trivial information, as exhibited
by explicit results.
  A d\'evissage is used that splits the problem into two steps, separating out
a `homology' calculation from `antisymmetrization'. This involves some
auxiliary categories, including a generalization of the upper walled Brauer
category.
  This approach passes through the `baby bead representations' of the title,
for which complete results are obtained. As an application, the composition
factors of Turchin and Willwacher's bead representations are calculated for a
new infinite family.

because of its capability of forming mechanically stable gels at relatively low

aggregation mechanism is still not presently understood at the microscopic
level due to the lack of atomistic information. Here we will fill this gap by
reporting molecular dynamics simulations of gellan chains at different polymer
and salt contents, being able to unveil the occurrence of the two steps in the
process, in agreement with existing hypotheses. At first, the formation of
double helices takes place, followed by the aggregation into super-structures.
For both steps, the role of bivalent cations appears to be crucial, as also
shown by rheology and atomic force microscopy measurements: they not only
facilitate the junction of the chains into double helices, but also promote
through bridging their arrangement into larger aggregates. On the other hand,
monovalent cations have a much more reduced role, making it possible to form
double helices only at very high salt content and not actively participating in
the formation of gels. Our simulations thus offer the first complete
microscopic overview of gellan aggregation and will be important for future use
of gellan-based systems for a wide variety of applications, ranging from food

natural language descriptions according to the input code. Comprehensiveness of
code representation is critical to code summarization task. However, most
existing approaches typically use coarse-grained fusion methods to integrate
multi-modal features. They generally represent different modalities of a piece
of code, such as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and a token sequence, as two
embeddings and then fuse the two ones at the AST/code levels. Such a coarse
integration makes it difficult to learn the correlations between fine-grained
code elements across modalities effectively. Aims: This study intends to
improve the model's prediction performance for high-quality code summarization
by accurately aligning and fully fusing semantic and syntactic structure
information of source code at node/token levels. Method: This paper proposes a
Multi-Modal Fine-grained Feature Fusion approach (MMF3) for neural code
summarization. We introduce a novel fine-grained fusion method, which allows
fine-grained fusion of multiple code modalities at the token and node levels.
Specifically, we use this method to fuse information from both token and AST
modalities and apply the fused features to code summarization. Results: We
conduct experiments on one Java and one Python datasets, and evaluate generated
summaries using four metrics. The results show that: 1) the performance of our
model outperforms the current state-of-the-art models, and 2) the ablation
experiments show that our proposed fine-grained fusion method can effectively
improve the accuracy of generated summaries. Conclusion: MMF3 can mine the
relationships between crossmodal elements and perform accurate fine-grained
element-level alignment fusion accordingly. As a result, more clues can be
provided to improve the accuracy of the generated code summaries.

there is no established method for adapting them to text-only input without

compare seven possible methods for adapting three different pre-trained VL

text-only tasks, while the models are less sensitive to how we adapt them to
non-zero-shot tasks. We also find that the adaptation methods perform
differently for different models and that unimodal model counterparts perform
on par with the VL models regardless of adaptation, indicating that current VL
models do not necessarily gain better language understanding from their

we design the RIS phases by leveraging the asymptotic deterministic equivalent
of the minimum SINR that depends only on the channel statistics. This
significantly reduces the computational complexity and the amount of
controlling data between the BS and RIS for updating the phases. This setup is
also useful for electromagnetic fields (EMF)-aware systems with constraints on
the maximum user's exposure to EMF. The numerical results show that the

Hence, any small variation leading to a nonzero anisotropic stress, i.e. a
difference between these potentials, would be an indication for modified
gravity. Current analyses usually consider gravitational lensing and
redshift-space distortions to constrain the anisotropic stress, but these rely
on certain assumptions like the validity of the weak equivalence principle, and
a specific time evolution of the functions encoding deviations from general
relativity. In this work, we propose a reparametrization of the gravitational

breaking. In this paper, we elaborate more on the issue. First, we discuss two
classes of initial states on the square lattice, the dynamics of which is
driven by complementary terms in the effective Hamiltonian and may be solved
exactly: (a) strips of consecutive neighbouring spins aligned in the opposite
direction of the surrounding spins, and (b) a large class of initial states,
characterized by the presence of a well-defined ""smooth"" interface separating
two infinitely extended regions with oppositely aligned spins. The evolution of
the latter states can be mapped onto that of an effective one-dimensional
fermionic chain, which is integrable in the infinite-coupling limit. In this
case, deep connections with noteworthy results in mathematics emerge, as well
as with similar problems in classical statistical physics. We present a
detailed analysis of the evolution of these interfaces both on the lattice and
in a suitable continuum limit, including the interface fluctuations and the
dynamics of entanglement entropy. Second, we provide analytical and numerical
evidence supporting the conclusion that the observed non-ergodicity -- arising
from Stark localization of the effective fermionic excitations -- persists away
from the infinite-Ising-coupling limit, and we highlight the presence of a
timescale $T\sim e^{c L\ln L}$ for the decay of a region of large linear size

forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE, for short) with a
recursive cost functional determined by a backward stochastic Volterra integral
equation (BSVIE, for short). It is found that such an optimal control problem
is time-inconsistent in general, even if the cost functional is reduced to a
classical Bolza type one as in Peng [50], Lim-Zhou [41], and Yong [74].
Therefore, instead of finding a global optimal control (which is
time-inconsistent), we will look for a time-consistent and locally optimal
equilibrium strategy, which can be constructed via the solution of an
associated equilibrium Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB, for short) equation. A
verification theorem for the local optimality of the equilibrium strategy is
proved by means of the generalized Feynman-Kac formula for BSVIEs and some
stability estimates of the representation for parabolic partial differential
equations (PDEs, for short). Under certain conditions, it is proved that the
equilibrium HJB equation, which is a nonlocal PDE, admits a unique classical
solution. As special cases and applications, the linear-quadratic problems, a
mean-variance model, a social planner problem with heterogeneous Epstein-Zin
utilities, and a Stackelberg game are briefly investigated. It turns out that
our framework can cover not only the optimal control problems for FBSDEs

paves the way for data-driven receding horizon control, whose behaviour is
identical to the ``oracle"" solution of certainty-equivalent model-based control
with measurable states. For efficient innovation estimation, a new low-rank

YBaCuO Josephson junctions (JJ) irradiated with microwave (MW) radiation in the
presence of an applied magnetic field B. The preferential direction of motion
of the Josephson vortices is due to the asymmetry-induced ratchet effect and
has a dramatic impact: for a particular positive dc bias current I when the
flux-flow is robust multiple pronounced Shapiro-steps are observed consistent
with a coherent operation of the array. This suggests an efficient
emission/detection of MW in related applications. In contrast, when we reverse
the direction of I, the flux-flow is reduced and the Shapiro-steps are strongly
suppressed due to a highly incoherent operation that suggests an inefficient
emission/detection of MW. Remarkably, by changing B slightly, the situation is
reversed: Shapiro steps are now suppressed for a positive I, while well
pronounced for a reverse current -I. Our results suggest that a preferential
vortex-flow has a very significant impact on the coherent MW operation of
superconducting devices consisting of either multiple JJs or a single long JJ
asymmetrically biased. This is particular relevant in the case of flux-flow
oscillators for sub-terahertz integrated-receivers, flux-driven Josephson

achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks, but with high
computational and energy cost. To improve its efficiency, a popular choice is
to compress the models via binarization which constrains the floating-point
values into binary ones to save resource consumption owing to cheap bitwise
operations significantly. However, existing binarization methods only aim at
minimizing the information loss for the input distribution statistically, while
ignoring the pairwise similarity modeling at the core of the attention. To this
end, we propose a new binarization paradigm customized to high-dimensional
softmax attention via kernelized hashing, called EcoFormer, to map the original
queries and keys into low-dimensional binary codes in Hamming space. The
kernelized hash functions are learned to match the ground-truth similarity
relations extracted from the attention map in a self-supervised way. Based on
the equivalence between the inner product of binary codes and the Hamming
distance as well as the associative property of matrix multiplication, we can
approximate the attention in linear complexity by expressing it as a
dot-product of binary codes. Moreover, the compact binary representations of
queries and keys enable us to replace most of the expensive multiply-accumulate
operations in attention with simple accumulations to save considerable on-chip
energy footprint on edge devices. Extensive experiments on both vision and
language tasks show that EcoFormer consistently achieves comparable performance
with standard attentions while consuming much fewer resources. For example,
based on PVTv2-B0 and ImageNet-1K, Ecoformer achieves a 73% on-chip energy
footprint reduction with only a 0.33% performance drop compared to the standard
attention. Code is available at https://github.com/ziplab/EcoFormer.

learning-based version of the algorithm is suggested which the simulation
results show the superiority of it to the fixed correntropy kernel version of
the algorithm. Moreover, some theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm

investigated. Thirdly, the mean convergence analysis is also added. Finally,

contain track 1, which is for supervised speaker verification and track 3,
which is for semi-supervised speaker verification. For track 1, we develop a
powerful U-Net-based speaker embedding extractor with a symmetric architecture.
The proposed system achieves 2.06% in EER and 0.1293 in MinDCF on the
validation set. Compared with the state-of-the-art ECAPA-TDNN, it obtains a
relative improvement of 20.7% in EER and 22.70% in MinDCF. For track 3, we
employ the joint training of source domain supervision and target domain
self-supervision to get a speaker embedding extractor. The subsequent
clustering process can obtain target domain pseudo-speaker labels. We adapt the
speaker embedding extractor using all source and target domain data in a
supervised manner, where it can fully leverage both domain information.
Moreover, clustering and supervised domain adaptation can be repeated until the
performance converges on the validation set. Our final submission is a fusion
of 10 models and achieves 7.75% EER and 0.3517 MinDCF on the validation set.

of differentiable physics. Yet, very few solutions have been suggested so far,
and only with a strong assumption on the nature of the shapes involved. In this
work, we introduce a generic and efficient approach to compute the derivatives
of collision detection for any pair of convex shapes, by notably leveraging
randomized smoothing techniques which have shown to be particularly adapted to
capture the derivatives of non-smooth problems. This approach is implemented in
the HPP-FCL and Pinocchio ecosystems, and evaluated on classic datasets and

quasi-periodicity is the essential characteristic to be learned, regarded as
the synthesize of the attributes of morphology (Am) and rhythm (Ar). Our key
insight is to suppress the over-dependence on Am or Ar while the generation

causal intervention (CCI) to form a novel training paradigm under a frame-level
contrastive framework. The intervention can eliminate the implicit statistical
bias brought by the single attribute and lead to more objective
representations. We conduct comprehensive experiments with the controlled

indicate that our approach can evidently improve the performance by up to 0.41%

discuss extended thermodynamics, we extend the definition of the thermodynamic
volume to cases with conformal anomalies using a procedure similar to that of

been shown to be unfair to certain demographic and non-demographic groups.
However, the fairness of face PAD is an understudied issue, mainly due to the
lack of appropriately annotated data. To address this issue, this work first
presents a Combined Attribute Annotated PAD Dataset (CAAD-PAD) by combining
several well-known PAD datasets where we provide seven human-annotated

Operational Decision Threshold Assignment (ODTA) on different data groups by
studying four face PAD approaches on our CAAD-PAD. To simultaneously represent
both the PAD fairness and the absolute PAD performance, we introduce a novel

to a TDE, the 13years-long (1991-2004) variability of double-peaked broad

and an effective time-average equation to approximate the original problem and
analyze the approximation error of the corresponding linearized PDE (Stokes)
system, where the simple front-tracking technique is used to update the slow
moving boundary. An effective multiscale method is then designed based on the
approximate problem and the front tracking framework. We also present a

error mitigation, comprising pulse sequences aimed at averaging away slowly

efficacy in the presence of noisy pulses in scenarios important for quantum
devices today: pulses with gate control errors, and the computational setting
where DD is used to reduce noise in every computational gate. We focus on the
well-known schemes of periodic (or universal) DD, and its extension,
concatenated DD, for scaling up its power. The qualitative conclusions from our
analysis of these two schemes nevertheless apply to other DD approaches. In the
presence of noisy pulses, DD does not always mitigate errors. It does so only
when the added noise from the imperfect DD pulses do not outweigh the increased
ability in averaging away the original background noise. We present breakeven
conditions that delineate when DD is useful, and further find that there is a
limit in the performance of concatenated DD, specifically in how far one can
concatenate the DD pulse sequences before the added noise no longer offers any
further benefit in error mitigation.

Recent work demonstrated the advantage of 3D VR sketching on this task. In our

fixed margin value, commonly used for retrieval tasks, contain many irrelevant
shapes and often just one or few with a similar structure to the query. To
mitigate this problem, we for the first time draw a connection between adaptive
margin values and shape similarities. In particular, we propose to use a
triplet loss with an adaptive margin value driven by a ""fitting gap"", which is
the similarity of two shapes under structure-preserving deformations. We also
conduct a user study which confirms that this fitting gap is indeed a suitable
criterion to evaluate the structural similarity of shapes. Furthermore, we

several inexpensive semiclassical approaches for modeling such nonadiabatic
dynamics in the presence of a time-dependent complex-valued Hamiltonian,
beginning with a straightforward instantaneous adiabatic fewest-switches
surface hopping (IA-FSSH) approach (where the electronic states depend on
position and time), continuing to a standard Floquet fewest switches surface
hopping (F-FSSH) approach (where the electronic states depend on position and

(F-PSSH) approach (where the electronic states depend on position, frequency,

Hamiltonians, we show that the Floquet phase-space adiabats are the optimal
choice of basis as far as accounting for Berry phase effects and delivering
accuracy. Thus, the F-PSSH algorithm sets the stage for modeling nonadiabatic

shared blackboard communication model with vertex-partitioned inputs. There are
$n$ players corresponding to vertices of an undirected graph, and each player
sees the edges incident on its vertex -- this way, each edge is known by both
its endpoints and is thus shared by two players. The players communicate in
simultaneous rounds by posting their messages on a shared blackboard visible to
all players, with the goal of computing an MIS of the graph. While the MIS
problem is well studied in other distributed models, and while shared
blackboard is, perhaps, the simplest broadcast model, lower bounds for our
problem were only known against one-round protocols.
  We present a lower bound on the round-communication tradeoff for computing an
MIS in this model. Specifically, we show that when $r$ rounds of interaction
are allowed, at least one player needs to communicate $\Omega(n^{1/20^{r+1}})$
bits. In particular, with logarithmic bandwidth, finding an MIS requires
$\Omega(\log\log{n})$ rounds. This lower bound can be compared with the
algorithm of Ghaffari, Gouleakis, Konrad, Mitrovi\'c, and Rubinfeld [PODC 2018]
that solves MIS in $O(\log\log{n})$ rounds but with a logarithmic bandwidth for
an average player. Additionally, our lower bound further extends to the closely
related problem of maximal bipartite matching.
  To prove our results, we devise a new round elimination framework, which we
call partial-input embedding, that may also be useful in future work for
proving round-sensitive lower bounds in the presence of edge-sharing between
players.
  Finally, we discuss several implications of our results to multi-round
(adaptive) distributed sketching algorithms, broadcast congested clique, and to
the welfare maximization problem in two-sided matching markets.

attractive Hubbard and d-wave type interactions and a repulsive Coulomb
interaction. The approach based on a frozen Fermi sea leads to a complex
structure of accessible relative momentum states which is very sensitive to the
total pair momentum of static or mobile pairs. It is found that interactions
with attraction of approximately half of an electronvolt give a satisfactory
agreement with experimentally reported results for the critical superconducting
temperature and its dependence on hole doping. Ground states exhibit d-wave
symmetries for both attractive Hubbard and d-wave interactions which is
essentially due to the particular Fermi surface structure and not entirely to
an eventual d-wave symmetry of the interaction. We also find pair states
created by Coulomb repulsion at excited energies above the Fermi energy and
determine the different mechanisms of their formation. In particular, we
identify such pairs in a region of negative mass at rather modest excitation
energies which is due to a particular band structure.

it is possible to determine the potential demand by the visitor's
walkability-based division. Second, our walkability measurement method follows
a bottom-up approach, starting with a small unit cell, understanding the entire

A recent new physics solution involves dark matter that decays into dark
photons in the presence of a thermal dark photon background. The produced
non-thermal dark photon spectrum then converts into standard photons around the
reionization era, yielding an approximate power-law radio excess with
brightness temperature $T(\nu)\simeq \nu^{-2.5}$ over a wide range of
frequencies, $\nu$. This simple power-law model comes intriguingly close to the
current data, even if several ingredients are required to make it work. In this

importance of individual effects. In particular, significant deviation from a
power law are present at $\nu\lesssim 100\,{\rm MHz}$ and $\nu\gtrsim 1\,{\rm

power-law spectrum, and may become testable in future observations. We also
highlight independent signatures that can be tested with future CMB spectral
distortion experiments such as {\it PIXIE}.

its potential in many real-world applications. In this context, multimodal
approaches have been shown to improve performance (over unimodal approaches) by
combining diverse and complementary sources of information, providing some
robustness to noisy and missing modalities. In this paper, we focus on
dimensional ER based on the fusion of facial and vocal modalities extracted
from videos, where complementary audio-visual (A-V) relationships are explored
to predict an individual's emotional states in valence-arousal space. Most
state-of-the-art fusion techniques rely on recurrent networks or conventional
attention mechanisms that do not effectively leverage the complementary nature
of A-V modalities. To address this problem, we introduce a joint
cross-attentional model for A-V fusion that extracts the salient features
across A-V modalities, that allows to effectively leverage the inter-modal
relationships, while retaining the intra-modal relationships. In particular, it
computes the cross-attention weights based on correlation between the joint
feature representation and that of the individual modalities. By deploying the
joint A-V feature representation into the cross-attention module, it helps to
simultaneously leverage both the intra and inter modal relationships, thereby
significantly improving the performance of the system over the vanilla
cross-attention module. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is validated
experimentally on challenging videos from the RECOLA and AffWild2 datasets.
Results indicate that our joint cross-attentional A-V fusion model provides a
cost-effective solution that can outperform state-of-the-art approaches, even
when the modalities are noisy or absent.

expected amplitudes, CWs have not been still detected so far. These steps,
namely the spectral estimation, the {\it peakmap} construction and the
procedure to select candidates in the FH plane, are critical as they contribute
to determine the final search sensitivity. Here, we are interested in
investigating their behavior in the (presently quite) extreme case of signal
clusters, due to many and strong CW sources, emitting gravitational waves (GWs)
within a small (i.e. <1 Hz wide) frequency range. This could happen for some
kinds of CW sources detectable by next generation detectors, like LISA,
Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. Moreover, this possibility has been
recently raised even for current Earth-based detectors, in some scenarios of CW
emission from ultralight boson clouds around stellar mass black holes (BHs). We
quantitatively evaluate the robustness of the FH analysis procedure, designed
to minimize the loss of single CW signals, under the unusual situation of
signal clusters. Results depend mainly on how strong in amplitude and dense in
frequency the signals are, and on the range of frequency they cover. We show
that indeed a small sensitivity loss may happen in presence of a very high mean
signal density affecting a frequency range of the order of one Hertz, while
when the signal cluster covers a frequency range of one tenth of Hertz, or
less, we may actually have a sensitivity gain. Overall, we demonstrate the FH
to be robust even in presence of moderate-to-large signal clusters.

by overlooking prior interpolation knowledge shared across different domains.
To overcome these limitations, we present a \textbf{N}umerical
\textbf{I}nterpolation approach using \textbf{E}ncoder \textbf{R}epresentation
of \textbf{T}ransformers (called \textbf{NIERT}). On one hand, NIERT utilizes
an encoder-only framework rather than the encoder-decoder structure. This way,
NIERT can embed observed and target points into a unified encoder
representation space, thus effectively exploiting the correlations among them
and obtaining more precise representations. On the other hand, we propose to
pre-train NIERT on large-scale synthetic mathematical functions to acquire
prior interpolation knowledge, and transfer it to multiple interpolation
domains with consistent performance gain. On both synthetic and real-world
datasets, NIERT outperforms the existing approaches by a large margin, i.e.,
4.3$\sim$14.3$\times$ lower MAE on TFRD subsets, and 1.7/1.8/8.7$\times$ lower
MSE on Mathit/PhysioNet/PTV datasets. The source code of NIERT is available at

anti-derivative of a function using Deep Neural Network architecture. In the
past, mathematicians have developed several numerical techniques to approximate
the values of definite integrals, but primitives or indefinite integrals are
often non-elementary. Anti-derivatives are necessarily required when there are
several parameters in an integrand and the integral obtained is a function of
those parameters. There is no theoretical method that can do this for any given
function. Some existing ways to get around this are primarily based on either
curve fitting or infinite series approximation of the integrand, which is then
integrated theoretically. Curve fitting approximations are inaccurate for
highly non-linear functions and require a different approach for every problem.
On the other hand, the infinite series approach does not give a closed-form
solution, and their truncated forms are often inaccurate. We claim that using a
single method for all integrals, our algorithm can approximate anti-derivatives
to any required accuracy. We have used this algorithm to obtain the
anti-derivatives of several functions, including non-elementary and oscillatory
integrals. This paper also shows the applications of our method to get the
closed-form expressions of elliptic integrals, Fermi-Dirac integrals, and
cumulative distribution functions and decrease the computation time of the

bilayer (2L) of MoS$_2$ in the trigonal (H) structural phase. Transverse
profiles of the induced orbital angular momentum accumulations are calculated
to first order in the longitudinally applied electric field. Our results show
that close to the nanoribbon's edge-state crossings energy, the orbital angular
momentum accumulations take place mainly around the ribbons' edges. They have
two contributions: one arising from the orbital Hall effect (OHE) and the other
consists in the OME. The former is transversely anti-symmetric with respect to
the principal axis of the nanoribbon, whereas the latter is symmetric, and
hence responsible for the resultant orbital magnetization induced in the
system. We found that the orbital accumulation originating from the OHE for the
1L-nanoribbon is approximately half that of a 2L-nanoribbon. Furthermore, while
the OME can reach fairly high values in 1L-TMD nanoribbons, it vanishes in the

Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7

Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), assuming their major axes are aligned with the
stellar light. We find that DR7 LRGs with masses $M \sim 2.7\times10^{13}
\mathrm{M}_{\odot}/h$ have halo ellipticities $e=0.46\pm0.10$. Expressed as a
fraction of the galaxy ellipticity, we find $f_h = 2.2\pm0.6$. For BOSS LRGs,
the detection is of marginal significance: $e = 0.20\pm0.10$ and
$f_h=0.7\pm0.7$. These results are in agreement with other measurements of halo
ellipticity from weak lensing and, taken together with previous results,
suggest an increase of halo ellipticity of $0.10\pm0.06$ per decade in halo
mass. This trend agrees with the predictions from hydrodynamical simulations,
which find that at higher halo masses, not only do dark matter haloes become
more elliptical, but that the misalignment between major axis of the stellar
light in the central galaxy and that of the dark matter decreases.

tracking algorithms for performance improvements. One of the limitations of
employing amplitude feature is that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the
target, i.e., the parameter of amplitude likelihood, is usually assumed to be
known and constant. In practice, the target SNR is always unknown, and is
dependent on aspect angle hence it will fluctuate. In this paper we propose a
hybrid labeled multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter that introduces the signal
amplitude into the LMB filter for tracking targets with unknown and fluctuating
SNR. The fluctuation of target SNR is modeled by an autoregressive gamma
process and amplitude likelihoods for Swerling 1 and 3 targets are considered.
Under Rao-Blackwell decomposition, an approximate Gamma estimator based on
Laplace transform and Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is proposed to estimate
the target SNR, and the kinematic state is estimated by a Gaussian mixture
filter conditioned on the target SNR. The performance of the proposed hybrid
filter is analyzed via a tracking scenario including three crossing targets.
Simulation results verify the efficacy of the proposed SNR estimator and
quantify the benefits of incorporating amplitude information for multi-target
tracking.

  2022)",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Deepfake refers to tailored and synthetically generated videos which are now
prevalent and spreading on a large scale, threatening the trustworthiness of
the information available online. While existing datasets contain different
kinds of deepfakes which vary in their generation technique, they do not
consider progression of deepfakes in a ""phylogenetic"" manner. It is possible
that an existing deepfake face is swapped with another face. This process of
face swapping can be performed multiple times and the resultant deepfake can be
evolved to confuse the deepfake detection algorithms. Further, many databases
do not provide the employed generative model as target labels. Model
attribution helps in enhancing the explainability of the detection results by
providing information on the generative model employed. In order to enable the
research community to address these questions, this paper proposes DeePhy, a
novel Deepfake Phylogeny dataset which consists of 5040 deepfake videos
generated using three different generation techniques. There are 840 videos of
one-time swapped deepfakes, 2520 videos of two-times swapped deepfakes and 1680
videos of three-times swapped deepfakes. With over 30 GBs in size, the database
is prepared in over 1100 hours using 18 GPUs of 1,352 GB cumulative memory. We
also present the benchmark on DeePhy dataset using six deepfake detection
algorithms. The results highlight the need to evolve the research of model
attribution of deepfakes and generalize the process over a variety of deepfake
generation techniques. The database is available at:

characterize collision setups that lead to strong localized and nonlocalized
intensity reduction effects. The values of the collision-induced changes in the
pulsed-beam's shape in both setups are larger by one to two orders of magnitude

collision-induced amplitude shift vs the difference between the first-order
dispersion coefficients for the two pulsed-beams has two local minima. This
finding represents the first observation of a deviation of the graph from the
common funnel shape that was obtained in all previous studies of fast two-pulse

perturbation theory are in good agreement with results of numerical simulations
with the perturbed linear propagation model, despite the strong

  Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022)",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Novel class discovery (NCD) aims to infer novel categories in an unlabeled
dataset leveraging prior knowledge of a labeled set comprising disjoint but
related classes. Existing research focuses primarily on utilizing the labeled
set at the methodological level, with less emphasis on the analysis of the
labeled set itself. Thus, in this paper, we rethink novel class discovery from
the labeled set and focus on two core questions: (i) Given a specific unlabeled
set, what kind of labeled set can best support novel class discovery? (ii) A
fundamental premise of NCD is that the labeled set must be related to the
unlabeled set, but how can we measure this relation? For (i), we propose and
substantiate the hypothesis that NCD could benefit more from a labeled set with
a large degree of semantic similarity to the unlabeled set. Specifically, we
establish an extensive and large-scale benchmark with varying degrees of
semantic similarity between labeled/unlabeled datasets on ImageNet by
leveraging its hierarchical class structure. As a sharp contrast, the existing
NCD benchmarks are developed based on labeled sets with different number of
categories and images, and completely ignore the semantic relation. For (ii),
we introduce a mathematical definition for quantifying the semantic similarity
between labeled and unlabeled sets. In addition, we use this metric to confirm
the validity of our proposed benchmark and demonstrate that it highly
correlates with NCD performance. Furthermore, without quantitative analysis,
previous works commonly believe that label information is always beneficial.
However, counterintuitively, our experimental results show that using labels
may lead to sub-optimal outcomes in low-similarity settings.

defining the minimum number of experiments necessary to identify the model.
Therefore, a nested loop optimization problem is proposed with three levels
considering the three main goals of the work: parameters estimation; topology
screening by isotherm definition; minimum number of experiments necessary to
yield a precise model. The proposed methodology emulated a real scenario by
introducing noise in the data and using a Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) approach.
Data reconciliation and uncertainty evaluation add robustness to the parameter
estimation adding precision and reliability to the model. The methodology is
validated considering experimental data from literature apart from the samples

corroborate that it is possible to carry out trustworthy parameter estimation

Jupiter Family Comet regions. SW1 is unique among the Centaurs in that it
experiences quasi-regular major outbursts and produces CO emission
continuously; however, the source of the CO is unclear. We argue that due to
its very large size (approx. 32 km radius), SW1 is likely still responding, via
amorphous water ice (AWI) conversion to crystalline water ice (CWI), to the
rapid change in its external thermal environment produced by its dynamical
migration from the Kuiper belt to the Gateway Region at the inner edge of the
Centaur region at 6 au. It is this conversion process that is the source of the
abundant CO and dust released from the object during its quiescent and outburst
phases. If correct, these arguments have a number of important predictions
testable via remote sensing and in situ spacecraft characterization, including:
the quick release on Myr timescales of CO from AWI conversion for any few
km-scale scattered disk KBO transiting into the inner system; that to date SW1
has only converted between 50 to 65% of its nuclear AWI to CWI; that volume
changes upon AWI conversion could have caused subsidence and cave-ins, but not
significant mass wasting or crater loss on SW1; that SW1s coma should contain
abundant amounts of CWI CO2-rich icy dust particles; and that when SW1 transits
into the inner system within the next 10,000 years, it will be a very different
kind of JFC comet.

  Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications","12 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The next generation ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (xURLLC)
need novel design to provide satisfactory services to the emerging
mission-critical applications. To improve the spectrum efficiency and enhance
the robustness of xURLLC, this paper proposes a robust beamforming and
rate-splitting design in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime for downlink
multi-user multi-antenna xURLLC systems. In the design, adaptive rate-splitting
is introduced to flexibly handle the complex inter-user interference and thus
improve the spectrum efficiency. Taking the imperfection of the channel state
information at the transmitter (CSIT) into consideration, a max-min user rate
problem is formulated to optimize the common and private beamforming vectors
and the rate-splitting vector under the premise of ensuring the requirements of
transmission latency and reliability of all the users. The optimization problem
is intractable due to the non-convexity of the constraint set and the infinite
constraints caused by CSIT uncertainties. To solve it, we convert the infinite
constraints into finite ones by the S-Procedure method and transform the
original problem into a difference of convex (DC) programming. A constrained
concave convex procedure (CCCP) and the Gaussian randomization based iterative
algorithm is proposed to obtain a local minimum. Simulation results confirm the
convergence, robustness and effectiveness of the proposed robust beamforming
and rate-splitting design in the FBL regime. It is also shown that the proposed
robust design achieves considerable performance gain in the worst user rate
compared with existing transmission schemes under various blocklength and block
error rate requirements.

are predicted to appear within a given genomic region at predefined locations

assuming a phylogenetic model of sequence evolution, we can compute a
probability score for any given k-mer at any given tree node. The k-mers with
sufficiently high probabilities can later be used to perform alignment-free
phylogenetic classification of new sequences-a procedure recently proposed for
the phylogenetic placement of metabarcoding reads and the detection of novel
virus recombinants. While computing phylo-k-mers, we need to consider large
numbers of k-mers at each tree node, which warrants the development of
efficient enumeration algorithms. We consider a formal definition of the
problem of phylo-k-mer computation: How to efficiently find all k-mers whose
probability lies above a user-defined threshold for a given tree node? We
describe and analyze algorithms for this problem, relying on branch-and-bound
and divideand-conquer techniques. We exploit the redundancy of adjacent windows
of the alignment and the structure of the probability matrix to save on
computation. Besides computational complexity analyses, we provide an empirical
evaluation of the relative performance of their implementations on real-world

knowledge are novel, are found to be clear improvements over the
branch-and-bound approach, especially when a large number of phylo-k-mers are

therapeutic efficacy and to reduce adverse reactions. However, effective and
synergistic drug combination prediction remains an open question because of the

models have been proposed to quantitatively predict the synergism of drug
combinations. The major limitation of existing deep learning methods is that
they are inherently not interpretable, which makes the conclusion of AI models
un-transparent to human experts, henceforth limiting the robustness of the

graph neural network (GNN) that reveals the underlying essential therapeutic
targets and mechanism of the synergy (MoS) by mining the sub-molecular network
of great importance. The key point of the interpretable GNN prediction model is
a novel graph pooling layer, Self-Attention based Node and Edge pool

nodes and edges based on the node features and the graph topology. As such, the
proposed GNN model provides a systematic way to predict and interpret the drug

evaluate SANEpool on molecular networks formulated by genes from 46 core cancer

supervised training of a deep neural network with pairs of measured low- and

labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain without any assumptions of
the label sets, which requires distinguishing the unknown samples from the
known ones in the target domain. A main challenge of UniDA is that the
nonidentical label sets cause the misalignment between the two domains.
Moreover, the domain discrepancy and the supervised objectives in the source
domain easily lead the whole model to be biased towards the common classes and
produce overconfident predictions for unknown samples. To address the above
challenging problems, we propose a new uncertainty-guided UniDA framework.
Firstly, we introduce an empirical estimation of the probability of a target
sample belonging to the unknown class which fully exploits the distribution of
the target samples in the latent space. Then, based on the estimation, we
propose a novel neighbors searching scheme in a linear subspace with a
$\delta$-filter to estimate the uncertainty score of a target sample and
discover unknown samples. It fully utilizes the relationship between a target
sample and its neighbors in the source domain to avoid the influence of domain
misalignment. Secondly, this paper well balances the confidences of predictions
for both known and unknown samples through an uncertainty-guided margin loss
based on the confidences of discovered unknown samples, which can reduce the
gap between the intra-class variances of known classes with respect to the
unknown class. Finally, experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

then fits the features to the target ahead values. The fitting network with the

evaluate the resilience of advanced DNNs to adversarial attacks. However,
traditional methods that use stickers as physical perturbations to deceive
classifiers face challenges in achieving stealthiness and are susceptible to
printing loss. Recently, advancements in physical attacks have utilized light
beams, such as lasers, to perform attacks, where the optical patterns generated
are artificial rather than natural. In this work, we propose a black-box
projector-based physical attack, referred to as adversarial color projection
(AdvCP), which manipulates the physical parameters of color projection to
perform an adversarial attack. We evaluate our approach on three crucial
criteria: effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness. In the digital
environment, we achieve an attack success rate of 97.60% on a subset of
ImageNet, while in the physical environment, we attain an attack success rate
of 100% in the indoor test and 82.14% in the outdoor test. The adversarial
samples generated by AdvCP are compared with baseline samples to demonstrate
the stealthiness of our approach. When attacking advanced DNNs, experimental
results show that our method can achieve more than 85% attack success rate in
all cases, which verifies the robustness of AdvCP. Finally, we consider the
potential threats posed by AdvCP to future vision-based systems and
applications and suggest some ideas for light-based physical attacks.

versatile and efficient expressiveness of complex shapes.The contact detection
is tackled robustly by gradient calculation of the closest point with a
Newton-Raphson based scheme. And the coupling with LBM is accomplished by a
classic sharp-interface scheme. As for refiling, a local refiling algorithm

gravity. Presently, we have no methods to determine the density of the
electromagnetic aether, or we say the $\Omega(1)$ substratum. Thus, we also
suppose that vacuum is filled with another kind of continuously distributed
substance, which may be called the $\Omega(2)$ substratum. Based on a theorem
of V. Fock on the mass tensor of a fluid, the contravariant energy-momentum
tensors of the $\Omega(1)$ and $\Omega(2)$ substrata are established.
Quasi-static solutions of the gravitational field equations in vacuum are
obtained. Based on an assumption, relationships between the contravariant
energy-momentum tensors of the $\Omega(1)$ and $\Omega(2)$ substrata and the
contravariant metric tensor are obtained. Thus, the cosmological constant is
calculated theoretically. The $\Omega(1)$ and $\Omega(2)$ substrata may be a
possible candidate of the dark energy. According to the theory of vacuum
mechanics, only those energy-momentum tensors of discrete or continuously
distributed sinks in the $\Omega(0)$ substratum are permitted to act as the
source terms in the generalized Einstein's equations. Thus, the zero-point
energy of electromagnetic fields is not qualified for a source term in the
generalized Einstein's equations. Some people believed that all kinds of
energies should act as source terms in the Einstein's equations. It may be this
unwarranted belief that leads to the cosmological constant problem. The mass
density of the $\Omega(1)$ and $\Omega(2)$ substrata is equivalent to that of
around $3$ protons contained in a box with a volume of $1$ cubic metre.

understanding the dynamic behavior of time-varying vector field data. The
topological notion of robustness has been introduced recently to quantify the
structural stability of critical points, that is, the robustness of a critical
point is the minimum amount of perturbation to the vector field necessary to
cancel it. A theoretical basis has been established previously that relates
critical point tracking with the notion of robustness, in particular, critical
points could be tracked based on their closeness in stability, measured by
robustness, instead of just distance proximities within the domain. However, in
practice, the computation of classic robustness may produce artifacts when a
critical point is close to the boundary of the domain; thus, we do not have a
complete picture of the vector field behavior within its local neighborhood. To
alleviate these issues, we introduce a multilevel robustness framework for the
study of 2D time-varying vector fields. We compute the robustness of critical
points across varying neighborhoods to capture the multiscale nature of the
data and to mitigate the boundary effect suffered by the classic robustness
computation. We demonstrate via experiments that such a new notion of
robustness can be combined seamlessly with existing feature tracking algorithms
to improve the visual interpretability of vector fields in terms of feature
tracking, selection, and comparison for large-scale scientific simulations. We
observe, for the first time, that the minimum multilevel robustness is highly
correlated with physical quantities used by domain scientists in studying a
real-world tropical cyclone dataset. Such observation helps to increase the

throughout the collaboration efforts and development lifecycle. In this work,
we discuss and analyse the challenges and opportunities we faced throughout the
creation of a transnational, European agricultural dataset containing reference
labels of cultivated crops. Together, this forms a succinct framework of
important elements one should consider when forging a dataset of their own.

a rigid-sphere higher-order ambisonic microphone array so that they are encoded
with N3D normalization and ACN channel order and thereby can be used with the
standard ambisonic software tools such as SPARTA and the IEM Plugin Suite. A

"2211.00584","Jens Ahrens","Jens Ahrens","Ambisonic Encoding of Signals From Equatorial Microphone Arrays",,,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The equatorial microphone array presented in (Ahrens et al., 2021) computes a
spherical harmonic (SH) representation of a sound field based on pressure
sensors along the equator of a rigid spherical baffle. The original formulation
uses complex-valued SH basis functions. This is inconvenient if the SH
representation of the captured sound field is intended to be stored in time
domain by means of real-valued audio signals as it is common in the spatial
audio format of ambisonics. The present document summarizes the modifications
that need to be applied to the mathematical formulation from (Ahrens et al.,
2021) to produce an ambisonic representation of the captured sound field that
is compatible with the established ambisonic software tools like SPARTA and the
IEM Plugin Suite. An example MATLAB script that implements this formulation is
provided.

mathematics which involves several interesting results and applications in
applied mathematics and physics ,One of the most important discrete dynamics
which is become of interest for researchers in the field is the rational
