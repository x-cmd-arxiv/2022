the Proof-of-Work, nourishes a heated debate. The underlying issue lies in a
highly energy-consuming process, defined as mining, required to validate
crypto-asset transactions. Mining is the process of solving a cryptographic
puzzle, incentivised by the possibility of gaining a reward. The higher the
number of users performing mining, i.e. miners, the higher the overall
electricity consumption of a blockchain. For that reason, mining constitutes a
negative environmental externality. Here, we study whether miners' interests
can meet the collective need to curb energy consumption. To this end, we
introduce the Crypto-Asset Game, namely a model based on the framework of
Evolutionary Game Theory devised for studying the dynamics of a population
whose agents can play as crypto-asset users or as miners. The energy
consumption of mining impacts the payoff of both strategies, representing a
direct cost for miners and an environmental factor for crypto-asset users. The
proposed model, studied via numerical simulations, shows that, in some
conditions, the agent population can reach a strategy profile that optimises
global energy consumption, i.e. composed of a low density of miners. To
conclude, can a Proof-of-Work-based blockchain become energetically
sustainable? Our results suggest that blockchain protocol parameters could have
a relevant role in the global energy consumption of this technology.

pioneering study proposed the FNet, which replaces the attention layer with the
Fourier Transform (FT) in the transformer encoder architecture. FNet achieves
competitive performances concerning the original transformer encoder model
while accelerating training process by removing the computational burden of the
attention mechanism. However, the FNet model ignores essential properties of
the FT from the classical signal processing that can be leveraged to increase
model efficiency further. We propose different methods to deploy FT efficiently
in transformer encoder models. Our proposed architectures have smaller number
of model parameters, shorter training times, less memory usage, and some
additional performance improvements. We demonstrate these improvements through

vertices of a hypergraph $H$, and Maker wins if and only if he claims all the
vertices of some edge of $H$. This paper provides a general framework to study
Maker-Breaker games, centered on the notion of danger at a vertex $x$, which is
a subhypergraph representing an urgent threat that Breaker must hit with his
next pick if Maker picks $x$. We then apply this concept in hypergraphs of rank
3, providing a structural characterization of the winner with perfect play as
well as optimal strategies for both players based on danger intersections. We
construct a family $\mathcal{F}$ of dangers such that a hypergraph $H$ of rank
3 is a Breaker win if and only if the $\mathcal{F}$-dangers at $x$ in $H$
intersect for all $x$. By construction of $\mathcal{F}$, this will mean that
$H$ is a Maker win if and only if Maker can guarantee the appearance, within
the first three rounds of play, of a very specific elementary subhypergraph (on
which Maker easily wins). This last result has a consequence on the algorithmic
complexity of deciding which player has a winning strategy on a given
hypergraph: this problem, which is known to be PSPACE-complete on 6-uniform
hypergraphs, is in polynomial time on hypergraphs of rank 3. This validates a
conjecture by Rahman and Watson. Another corollary of our result is that, if
Maker has a winning strategy on a hypergraph of rank 3, then he can ensure to
claim an edge in a number of rounds that is logarithmic in the number of

low-complexity signals (e.g., sparse signals, low-rank matrices) from the phase
of complex linear measurements. While perfect recovery of signal direction in
PO-CS was observed quite early, the exact reconstruction guarantee for a fixed,
real signal was recently done by Jacques and Feuillen [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory,
67 (2021), pp. 4150-4161]. However, two questions remain open: the uniform
recovery guarantee and exact recovery of complex signal. In this paper, we
almost completely address these two open questions. We prove that, all complex
sparse signals or low-rank matrices can be uniformly, exactly recovered from a
near optimal number of complex Gaussian measurement phases. By recasting PO-CS
as a linear compressive sensing problem, the exact recovery follows from
restricted isometry property (RIP). Our approach to uniform recovery guarantee
is based on covering arguments that involve a delicate control of the (original
linear) measurements with overly small magnitude. To work with complex signal,
a different sign-product embedding property and a careful rescaling of the
sensing matrix are employed. In addition, we show an extension that the uniform
recovery is stable under moderate bounded noise. We also propose to add
Gaussian dither before capturing the phases to achieve full reconstruction with
norm information. Experimental results are reported to corroborate and
demonstrate our theoretical results.

learning. Instead of continuously tracking a precomputed path, the robot needs
to reach a target position within a provided time. The task's success is only
evaluated at the end of an episode, meaning that the policy does not need to
reach the target as fast as possible. It is free to select its path and the
locomotion gait. Training a policy in this way opens up a larger set of
possible solutions, which allows the robot to learn more complex behaviors. We
compare our approach to velocity tracking and additionally show that the time
dependence of the task reward is critical to successfully learn these new
behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate the successful deployment of policies on a
real quadrupedal robot. The robot is able to cross challenging terrains, which
were not possible previously, while using a more energy-efficient gait and
achieving a higher success rate.

harnessing multipartite nonlocal correlations may lead to better performance.
Here, we consider tripartite DICKA and DIRE protocols based on testing

evaluate the asymptotic performance of the DICKA (DIRE) protocols in terms of
their conference key rate (net randomness generation rate), by deriving lower
bounds on the conditional von Neumann entropy of one party's outcome and two

two-outcome entropy. We additionally re-derive the analytical one-outcome

not a precondition for multipartite DIRE while its necessity for DICKA remains

selection methods only estimate the degree of linear dependency between
variables and select the best features based on univariate statistical tests.
Furthermore, the sparsity of the feature space involved in the learning
representation is ignored. Goal: Our aim is therefore to access an alternative
approach to tackle the sparsity by compressing the clinical representation
feature space, where limited French clinical notes can also be dealt with
effectively. Methods: This study proposed an autoencoder learning algorithm to
take advantage of sparsity reduction in clinical note representation. The
motivation was to determine how to compress sparse, high-dimensional data by
reducing the dimension of the clinical note representation feature space. The
classification performance of the classifiers was then evaluated in the trained

performance gains of up to 3% for each evaluation. Finally, the classifier
achieved a 92% accuracy, 91% recall, 91% precision, and 91% f1-score in

focusing on perceptually critical areas; and ii) it can handle varying
communication bandwidth by dynamically adjusting spatial areas involved in

parameter constraints are compatible with the already published results, with a
slight dependence on how conservative the imposed background limits are. A
tighter lower limit causes the inferred radius to increase, and a tighter upper
limit causes it to decrease. We also extend the study of the inferred emission
geometry to examine the degree of deviation from antipodality of the hot
regions. We show that there is a significant offset to an antipodal spot
configuration, mainly due to the non-half-cycle azimuthal separation of the two
emitting spots. The offset angle from the antipode is inferred to be above 25

by dividing the scale parameter of the conditional asymmetric Laplace (AL)
distribution by a convenient mixing random variable taking values on all or

vector $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ providing greater flexibility to the resulting
ALSM. Advantageously with respect to the AL distribution, the members of our

hierarchical and stochastic representations and moments of practical interest.
We describe an EM algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the

consisting of three merging late-type galaxies, out of 315 systems in the SIT
(SDSS-based catalogue of Isolated Triplets). The main aims of this work are to
study its dynamical evolution and star formation history (SFH), as well as its
dependence on its local and large-scale environment. To study its dynamics,
parameters such as the velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{v}$), the harmonic radius
($R_{H}$), the crossing time ($H_0t_c$), and the virial mass ($M_{vir}$), along
with the compactness of the triplet ($S$) were considered. To constrain the
SFH, we used CIGALE to fit its observed spectral energy distribution using
multi-wavelength data from the ultraviolet to the infrared. According to its
SFH, SIT 45 presents star-formation, where the galaxies also present recent
($\sim $200 Myr) star-formation increase, indicating that this activity may
have been triggered by the interaction. Its dynamical configuration suggests
that the system is highly evolved in comparison to the SIT. However this is not
expected for systems composed of star-forming late-type galaxies, based on
observations in compact groups. We conclude that SIT 45 is a system of three
interacting galaxies that are evolving within the same dark matter halo, where
its compact configuration is a consequence of the on-going interaction, rather
than due to a long-term evolution (as suggested from its $H_0t_c$ value). We
consider two scenarios for the present configuration of the triplet, one where
one of the members is a tidal galaxy, and another where this galaxy arrives to
the system after the interaction. Both scenarios need further exploration. The
isolated triplet SIT 45 is therefore an ideal system to study short timescale
mechanisms ($\sim 10^8$ years), such as starbursts triggered by interactions
which are more frequent at higher redshift.

analyzing this dataset, this thesis aims to show that most companies, which
have a share buyback announced are underperforming the MSCI World. A minority
of companies, however, significantly outperform the MSCI World. This
significant overperformance leads to a net gain when looking at the averages of
all companies. If the benchmark index is adjusted for the respective size of
the companies, the average overperformance disappears, and the majority
underperforms even greater. However, it was found that companies that announce
a share buyback with a volume of at least 1% of their market cap, deliver, on
average, a significant overperformance, even when using an adjusted benchmark.
It was also found that companies that announce share buybacks in times of
crisis emerge better than the overall market. Additionally, the generated
dataset was used to train 72 machine learning models. Through this, it was able
to find many strategies that could achieve an accuracy of up to 77% and
generate great excess returns. A variety of performance indicators could be
improved across six different time frames and a significant overperformance was
identified. This was achieved by training several models for different tasks

significant improvement by fusing weak learners, in order to create one strong

tools for approximating the solution to partial differential equations (PDEs).
These networks map input functions that describe material properties, forcing
functions and boundary data to the solution of a PDE. This work describes a new
architecture for operator networks that mimics the form of the numerical
solution obtained from an approximate variational or weak formulation of the
problem. The application of these ideas to a generic elliptic PDE leads to a
variationally mimetic operator network (VarMiON). Like the conventional Deep
Operator Network (DeepONet) the VarMiON is also composed of a sub-network that
constructs the basis functions for the output and another that constructs the
coefficients for these basis functions. However, in contrast to the DeepONet,
the architecture of these sub-networks in the VarMiON is precisely determined.
An analysis of the error in the VarMiON solution reveals that it contains
contributions from the error in the training data, the training error, the
quadrature error in sampling input and output functions, and a ""covering error""
that measures the distance between the test input functions and the nearest
functions in the training dataset. It also depends on the stability constants
for the exact solution operator and its VarMiON approximation. The application
of the VarMiON to a canonical elliptic PDE reveals that for approximately the
same number of network parameters, on average the VarMiON incurs smaller errors
than a standard DeepONet. Further, its performance is more robust to variations
in input functions, the techniques used to sample the input and output
functions, the techniques used to construct the basis functions, and the number
of input functions.

corresponds to query complexity, and size corresponds to storage space. The
depth measure is the most well-studied one, and is known to be polynomially
related to several non-computational complexity measures of functions such as
certificate complexity. The size measure is also studied, but to a lesser
extent. Another decision tree measure that has received very little attention
is the minimal rank of the decision tree, first introduced by Ehrenfeucht and
Haussler in 1989. This measure is closely related to the logarithm of the size,
but is not polynomially related to depth, and hence it can reveal additional
information about the complexity of a function. It is characterised by the
value of a Prover-Delayer game first proposed by Pudl\'ak and Impagliazzo in
the context of tree-like resolution proofs. In this paper we study this measure
further. We obtain an upper bound on depth in terms of rank and Fourier
sparsity. We obtain upper and lower bounds on rank in terms of (variants of)
certificate complexity. We also obtain upper and lower bounds on the rank for
composed functions in terms of the depth of the outer function and the rank of
the inner function. This allow us to easily recover known asympotical lower
bounds on logarithm of the size for Iterated AND-OR and Iterated 3-bit
Majority. We compute the rank exactly for several natural functions and use
them to show that all the bounds we have obtained are tight. We also show that
rank in the simple decision tree model can be used to bound query complexity,
or depth, in the more general conjunctive decision tree model. Finally, we
improve upon the known size lower bound for the Tribes function and conclude
that in the size-rank relationship for decision trees, obtained by Ehrenfeucht
and Haussler, the upper bound for Tribes is asymptotically tight.

quenching is in better agreement with the fraction of passive galaxies as a
function of stellar mass $M_*$ and with the galaxy morphological distribution
on a star-formation-rate vs. $M_*$ diagram. Besides this main finding, there
are two other results from this research. First, a successful BH-quenching
model requires that minor mergers contribute to the growth of supermassive BHs.
If galaxies that reach high $M_*$ through repeated minor mergers are not
quenched, there are too many blue galaxies at high masses. Second, the growth
of BHs in mergers must become less efficient at low masses in order to
reproduce the $M_{\rm BH}$--$M_*$ relation and the passive fraction as a
function of $M_*$, in agreement with the idea that supernovae prevent efficient
BH growth in systems with low escape speeds. Our findings are consistent with a
quasar-feedback scenario in which BHs grow until they are massive enough to
blow away the cold gas in their host galaxies and to heat the hot
circumgalactic medium to such high entropy that its cooling time becomes long.

condition, just as observed in nature and experiments. However, we also found
that density and temperature in our inertial flow model behave unrealistically.
The goal of the current work is to demonstrate technical possibility of
modeling compressible, turbulent flow at low Mach number where both density and
temperature behave in a more realistic fashion. Here we focus on a new
treatment of the pressure variable, which constitutes a compromise between
compressible, incompressible and inertial flow. Similarly to incompressible
flow, the proposed equation for the pressure variable is artificial, rather
than derived directly from kinetic formulation. However, unlike that for
incompressible flow, our pressure equation only damps the divergence of
velocity, instead of setting it directly to zero. We find that turbulence
develops in our weakly compressible model much like it does in the inertial
flow model, but density and temperature behave more realistically.

central Base Station (BS), scheduling agent communications over a network. Due
to a hard bandwidth constraint on the number of transmissions through the
network, at most $R_d < N$ agents can concurrently access their state
information through the network. Under standard assumptions on the information
structure of the agents and the BS, we first show that the control actions of
the agents are free of any dual effect, allowing for separation between
estimation and control problems at each agent. Next, we propose a weighted age
of information (WAoI) metric for the scheduling problem of the BS, where the
weights depend on the estimation error of the agents. The BS aims to find the
optimum scheduling policy that minimizes the WAoI, subject to the hard
bandwidth constraint. Since this problem is NP hard, we first relax the hard
constraint to a soft update rate constraint, and then compute an optimal policy
for the relaxed problem by reformulating it into a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). This then inspires a sub-optimal policy for the bandwidth constrained
problem, which is shown to approach the optimal policy as $N \rightarrow

framework wherein we first design decentralized control policies for a limiting
case of the $N$-agent system (as $N \rightarrow \infty$). By explicitly
constructing the mean-field system, we prove the existence and uniqueness of
the mean-field equilibrium. Consequently, we show that the obtained equilibrium
policies constitute an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the finite agent system.
Finally, we validate the performance of both the scheduling and the control

Although numerical computation-based iterative methods such as the minimal mean

already attain near-optimal performance, their computational cost renders them
unsuitable for real-time applications. However, recent studies have
demonstrated that machine learning techniques like deep neural networks (DNN)
can learn the mapping done by those algorithms between channel state

this mapping in near real-time. In light of this, we investigate various DNN
architectures for beamforming challenges in the terahertz (THz) band for

of the world. While the brain solves this blind source separation (BSS) problem
continuously, its algorithms remain unknown. Previous work on
biologically-plausible BSS algorithms assumed that observed signals are linear
mixtures of statistically independent or uncorrelated sources, limiting the
domain of applicability of these algorithms. To overcome this limitation, we
propose novel biologically-plausible neural networks for the blind separation
of potentially dependent/correlated sources. Differing from previous work, we
assume some general geometric, not statistical, conditions on the source
vectors allowing separation of potentially dependent/correlated sources.
Concretely, we assume that the source vectors are sufficiently scattered in
their domains which can be described by certain polytopes. Then, we consider
recovery of these sources by the Det-Max criterion, which maximizes the
determinant of the output correlation matrix to enforce a similar spread for
the source estimates. Starting from this normative principle, and using a
weighted similarity matching approach that enables arbitrary linear
transformations adaptable by local learning rules, we derive two-layer
biologically-plausible neural network algorithms that can separate mixtures
into sources coming from a variety of source domains. We demonstrate that our
algorithms outperform other biologically-plausible BSS algorithms on correlated
source separation problems.

We study CRe scattering and energy gain due to ion cyclotron (IC) waves

on the entanglement structure of the dual theory. In this paper, we describe
how changes in the entanglement due to a local projective measurement (LPM) on
a subregion $A$ of the boundary theory modify the bulk dual spacetime. We find
that LPMs destroy portions of the bulk geometry, yielding post-measurement bulk
spacetimes dual to the complementary unmeasured region $A^c$ that are cut off
by end-of-the-world branes. Using a bulk calculation in $AdS_3$ and tensor
network models of holography, we show that the portions of the bulk geometry
that are preserved after the measurement depend on the size of $A$ and the
state we project onto. The post-measurement bulk dual to $A^c$ includes regions
that were originally part of the entanglement wedge of $A$ prior to
measurement. This suggests that LPMs performed on a boundary subregion $A$
teleport part of the bulk information originally encoded in $A$ into the
complementary region $A^c$. In semiclassical holography an arbitrary amount of
bulk information can be teleported in this way, while in tensor network models
the teleported information is upper-bounded by the amount of entanglement
shared between $A$ and $A^c$ due to finite-$N$ effects. When $A$ is the union
of two disjoint subregions, the measurement triggers an entangled/disentangled
phase transition between the remaining two unmeasured subregions, corresponding
to a connected/disconnected phase transition in the bulk description. Our
results shed new light on the effects of measurement on the entanglement
structure of holographic theories and give insight on how bulk information can
be manipulated from the boundary theory. They could also be extended to more
general quantum systems and tested experimentally, and represent a first step
towards a holographic description of measurement-induced phase transitions.

distribution of optical galaxies up to redshift z ~ 1. In the more distant
universe, the relationship between the dust-obscured population of star-forming
galaxies observed at millimetre wavelengths and the network of cosmic filaments
of dark matter apparent in all cosmological hydrodynamical simulations is still
under study. Using the NIKA2 dual-band millimetre camera, we mapped a field of
~ 90 arcminutes^2 in the direction of the star GJ526 simultaneously in its
1.15-mm and 2.0-mm continuum wavebands to investigate the nature of the
quasi-alignment of five sources found ten years earlier with the MAMBO camera
at 1.2 mm. We find that these sources are not clumps of a circumstellar debris
disc around this star as initially hypothesized. Rather, they must be
dust-obscured star-forming galaxies, or sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs), in the
distant background. The new NIKA2 map at 1.15 mm reveals a total of seven SMGs
distributed in projection on the sky along a filament-like structure crossing
the whole observed field. Furthermore, we show that the NIKA2 and supplemental
Herschel photometric data are compatible with a model of the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of these sources when a common redshift of 2.5 and typical
values of the dust parameters for SMGs are adopted. Hence, we speculate that
these SMGs might be located in a filament of the distant `cosmic web'. The
length of this candidate cosmic filament crossing the whole map is at least 4
cMpc (comoving), and the separations between sources are between 0.25 cMpc and
1.25 cMpc at this redshift, in line with expectations from cosmological
simulations. Nonetheless, further observations to determine the precise
spectroscopic redshifts of these sources are required to definitively support
this hypothesis of SMGs embedded in a cosmic filament of dark matter.

small scales as well as the presence of a prominent bump on larger scales and
whose physical size, $L_{\rm hub}$, falls in the range of $\approx 7000$ au to
$60000$ au. These scales correspond to the sizes of the most compact clumps
within the protocluster forming clouds. A significant correlation is found
between $L_{\rm hub}$ and the surface density of the free-free emission
estimated from the integrated flux of the H41$\alpha$ recombination line
$\left(\Sigma_{\rm H41\alpha}^{\rm free-free}\right)$ as well as a significant
anti-correlation between $L_{\rm hub}$ and the ratio of the 1.3 mm to 3 mm

their star formation activity with more evolved clouds having larger

accuracy of the parametric galaxy morphology measurements in imaging predicted
from within the Euclid Wide Survey. We evaluate the performance of five
state-of-the-art surface-brightness-fitting codes DeepLeGATo, Galapagos-2,
Morfometryka, Profit and SourceXtractor++ on a sample of about 1.5 million
simulated galaxies resembling reduced observations with the Euclid VIS and NIR
instruments. The simulations include analytic S\'ersic profiles with one and
two components, as well as more realistic galaxies generated with neural
networks. We find that, despite some code-specific differences, all methods
tend to achieve reliable structural measurements (10% scatter on ideal S\'ersic
simulations) down to an apparent magnitude of about 23 in one component and 21
in two components, which correspond to a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately
1 and 5 respectively. We also show that when tested on non-analytic profiles,
the results are typically degraded by a factor of 3, driven by systematics. We
conclude that the Euclid official Data Releases will deliver robust structural
parameters for at least 400 million galaxies in the Euclid Wide Survey by the
end of the mission. We find that a key factor for explaining the different
behaviour of the codes at the faint end is the set of adopted priors for the
various structural parameters.

electric field and can thus excite phonon-polaritons in suitable materials. We
revisit the calculation of the axion-photon conversion power output from such
materials, accounting for finite volume effects, and material losses. Our
calculation shows how phonon-polaritons can be converted to propagating photons
at the material boundary, offering a route to detecting the signal. Using the
dielectric functions of GaAs, Al$_2$O$_3$, and SiO$_2$, a fit to our loss model
leads to a signal of lower magnitude than previous calculations. We demonstrate
how knowledge of resonances in the dielectric function can directly be used to
calculate the sensitivity of any material to axion dark matter. We argue that a
combination of low losses encountered at $\mathcal{O}(1)$ K temperatures and
near future improvements in detector dark count allow one to probe the QCD
axion in the mass range $m_a\approx 100$ meV. This provides further impetus to

bolometric light curve is described by a sharp exponential decay steeper than
the canonical $t^{-5/3}$ power law, making AT 2020wey the fastest declining TDE
to date. Multi-wavelength fits to the light curve indicate a complete

previous faint and fast TDEs, there are no obvious Bowen fluorescence lines in
the spectra of AT 2020wey. There is a strong correlation between the
MOSFIT-derived black hole masses of TDEs and their decline rate. However, AT
2020wey is an outlier in this correlation, which could indicate that its fast
early decline may be dictated by a different physical mechanism than fallback.

that they should constitute up to $\sim$ 50 - 60 % of the entire population and
their numbers could alleviate some of the tension between the observed and
theoretical TDE rate estimates. We calculate the optical TDE luminosity
function and we find a steep power-law relation $dN/dL_{g} \propto

The young (1-3 Myr), densely-populated ONC harbors about a thousand bright
brown dwarfs (BDs) and free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPs). TEMPO
offers sufficient photometric precision to monitor FFPs with ${\rm M}\geq1{\rm
M}_{\rm J}$ for transiting satellites. The survey is also capable of detecting
FFPs down to sub-Saturn masses via direct imaging, although follow-up
confirmation will be challenging. TEMPO yield estimates include 14 (3-22)
exomoons/satellites transiting FFPs and 54 (8-100) satellites transiting BDs.
Of this population, approximately $50\%$ of companions would be ""super-Titans""

exoplanets transiting young Orion stars, of which $>50\%$ will orbit
mid-to-late M dwarfs and approximately ten will be proto-habitable zone,

provide the first census demographics of small exosatellites orbiting FFPs and
BDs, while simultaneously offering insights into exoplanet evolution at the
earliest stages. This detected exosatellite population is likely to be markedly
different from the current census of exoplanets with similar masses (e.g.,
Earth-mass exosatellites that still possess H/He envelopes). Although our yield
estimates are highly uncertain, as there are no known exoplanets or exomoons
analogous to these satellites, the TEMPO survey would test the prevailing
theories of exosatellite formation and evolution, which limit the certainty
surrounding detection yields.

the observed bursting mechanisms and the creation of surface hotspots. We
present MATINS, a new three dimensions numerical code for magneto-thermal
evolution in neutron stars, based on a finite-volume scheme that employs the
cubed-sphere system of coordinates. In this first work, we focus on the crustal
magnetic evolution, with the inclusion of realistic calculations for the
neutron star structure, composition and electrical conductivity assuming a
simple temperature evolution profile. MATINS follows the evolution of strong
fields (1e14-1e15 Gauss) with complex non-axisymmetric topologies and dominant
Hall-drift terms, and it is suitable for handling sharp current sheets. After
introducing the technical description of our approach and some tests, we
present long-term simulations of the non-linear field evolution in realistic
neutron star crusts. The results show how the non-axisymmetric Hall cascade
redistributes the energy over different spatial scales. Following the
exploration of different initial topologies, we conclude that during a few tens
of kyr, an equipartition of energy between the poloidal and toroidal components
happens at small-scales. However, the magnetic field keeps a strong memory of
the initial large-scales, which are much harder to be restructured or created.
This indicates that large-scale configuration attained during the neutron star
formation is crucial to determine the field topology at any evolution stage.

interpolates between two known classical shadows schemes based on random Pauli
measurements and random Clifford measurements. These can be seen within our
scheme as the special cases of zero and infinite depth, respectively. We focus
on the regime where depth scales logarithmically in n and provide evidence that
this retains the desirable properties of both extremal schemes whilst, in
contrast to the random Clifford scheme, also being experimentally feasible. We
present methods for two key tasks; estimating expectation values of certain
observables from generated classical shadows and, computing upper bounds on the
depth-modulated shadow norm, thus providing rigorous guarantees on the accuracy
of the output estimates. We consider observables that can be written as a
linear combination of poly(n) Paulis and observables that can be written as a
low bond dimension matrix product operator. For the former class of observables
both tasks are solved efficiently in n. For the latter class, we do not
guarantee efficiency but present a method that works in practice; by
variationally computing a heralded approximate inverses of a tensor network
that can then be used for efficiently executing both these tasks.

operations on distributed multipartite quantum systems. We propose that
indefinite causal structure arising due to quantum superposition of different
space-time geometries can be used as an independent universal resource for
local implementation of any quantum operation on spatially distributed quantum
systems. Consequently, all such quantum tasks that are not accomplishable by
local operations and classical communication (LOCC) only also become locally
accomplishable. We show that exploiting indefinite causal structure as the sole
resource, it is possible to perfectly teleport the state of one agent's
subsystem to the other distant laboratory in such a way that the agent at the
distant laboratory can have access to the whole initially shared state in his
or her laboratory and can perform any global quantum operation on the joint
state locally. We further find that, after the teleportation process, the
resource -- indefinite causal structure of the space-time does not get
consumed. Hence, after implementing the desired quantum operation the state of
the first agent's subsystem can be teleported back to its previous laboratory
using the same resource. We show that this two-way teleportation is not always
necessary for locally executing all nonlocal quantum tasks that are not
realisable by LOCC only. Without invoking any kind of teleportation, we present
a protocol for perfect local discrimination of the set of four Bell states that
exploits indefinite causal structure as the sole resource. As immediate
upshots, we present some more examples of such nonlocal tasks as local
discrimination of the set of states exhibiting ``quantum nonlocality without
entanglement"" and activation of bound entangled states that are also achievable
by our proposed protocol incorporating indefinite causal structure as a
resource.

challenging problem in Reinforcement Learning (RL). In particular, it is hard
to train a policy that can generalize over objects with different semantic

technique of visual affordance has shown great prospects in providing
object-centric information priors with effective actionable semantics. As such,
an effective policy can be trained to open a door by knowing how to exert force
on the handle. However, to learn the affordance, it often requires
human-defined action primitives, which limits the range of applicable tasks. In
this study, we take advantage of visual affordance by using the contact
information generated during the RL training process to predict contact maps of
interest. Such contact prediction process then leads to an end-to-end
affordance learning framework that can generalize over different types of

on eight types of manipulation tasks. Results showed that our methods
outperform baseline algorithms, including visual-based affordance methods and

  Classification","Accepted at AACL-IJCNLP 2022",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Language models are pre-trained using large corpora of generic data like book
corpus, common crawl and Wikipedia, which is essential for the model to
understand the linguistic characteristics of the language. New studies suggest
using Domain Adaptive Pre-training (DAPT) and Task-Adaptive Pre-training (TAPT)
as an intermediate step before the final finetuning task. This step helps cover
the target domain vocabulary and improves the model performance on the
downstream task. In this work, we study the impact of training only the
embedding layer on the model's performance during TAPT and task-specific
finetuning. Based on our study, we propose a simple approach to make the
intermediate step of TAPT for BERT-based models more efficient by performing
selective pre-training of BERT layers. We show that training only the BERT
embedding layer during TAPT is sufficient to adapt to the vocabulary of the
target domain and achieve comparable performance. Our approach is
computationally efficient, with 78\% fewer parameters trained during TAPT. The
proposed embedding layer finetuning approach can also be an efficient domain
adaptation technique.

comprehension part of QA systems against errors that automatic speech

unexplored. However, such errors can affect the performance of passage
retrieval, leading to inferior end-to-end performance. To address this gap, we
augment two existing large-scale passage ranking and open domain QA datasets
with synthetic ASR noise and study the robustness of lexical and dense
retrievers against questions with ASR noise. Furthermore, we study the
generalizability of data augmentation techniques across different domains; with
each domain being a different language dialect or accent. Finally, we create a
new dataset with questions voiced by human users and use their transcriptions
to show that the retrieval performance can further degrade when dealing with
natural ASR noise instead of synthetic ASR noise.

These objects are extended along one of the spatial directions, so they also
behave as strings; hence the name of domain wall strings. We show analytically
and numerically that the amount of radiation from the propagation of wiggles on
these objects is negligible except for regions of high curvature. Therefore, at
low curvatures, the domain wall strings behave exactly as the Nambu-Goto action
predicts. We show this explicitly with the use of several different numerical
experiments of the evolution of these objects in a lattice. We then explore
their dynamics in the presence of internal mode excitations. We do this again
by performing field theory simulations and identify an effective action that
captures the relevant interactions between the different degrees of freedom
living on the string. We uncover a new parametric resonance instability that
transfers energy from the internal mode to the position of the domain wall. We
show that this instability accelerates the radiation of the internal mode
energy. We also explore the possibility of exciting the internal mode of the
soliton with the collision of wiggles on the domain wall. Our numerical
experiments indicate that this does not happen unless the wiggles have already
a wavelength of the order of the string thickness. Finally, we comment on the
possible relevance of our findings to cosmological networks of defects. We
argue that our results cast some doubts on the significance of the internal
modes in cosmological applications beyond a brief transient period right after
their formation. This, however, should be further investigated using
cosmological simulations of our model.

galaxies have negative gradients (i.e. redder in the center, bluer in the

dust attenuation. A smaller population (roughly 15\%) of star-forming galaxies
have positive $U-V$ but negative $V-J$ gradients implying centrally
concentrated star-formation. For quiescent galaxies we find a diversity of UVJ
color profiles, with roughly one-third showing star-formation in their center.

energy tracks for a sample of $254$ non-repeating low dispersion measure FRBs
from the CHIME/FRB Catalog-1, and use these to determine $n(E_{33} \mid
\alpha)$ the conditional energy distribution i.e. the number of FRBs in the
interval $\Delta E_{33}$ given a value of $\alpha$. Considering $-10 \le \alpha
\le 10$, we find that the entire energy scale shifts to higher energy values as
$\alpha$ is increased. For all values of $\alpha$, we can identify two distinct
energy ranges indicating that there are possibly two distinct FRB populations.
At high energies, the distribution is well fitted by a modified Schechter
function whose slope and characteristic energy both increase with $\alpha$. At
low energies, the number of FRBs are in excess of the predictions of the
modified Schechter function indicating that we may have a distinctly different
population of low-energy FRBs. We have checked that our main findings are
reasonably robust to the assumptions regarding the Galactic Halo and Host

revolutionize the cost of living, safety, ecological sustainability, and
quality of life of societies on a world-wide scale. Some key components of the
smart city construct are connected smart grids, self-driving cars, federated

surveillance systems. While exciting in prospect, these technologies and their
subsequent integration cannot be attempted without addressing the potential
societal impacts of such a high degree of automation and data sharing.
Additionally, the feasibility of coordinating so many disparate tasks will
require a fast, extensible, unifying framework. To that end, we propose FaRO2,
a completely reimagined successor to FaRO1, built from the ground up. FaRO2
affords all of the same functionality as its predecessor, serving as a unified
biometric API harness that allows for seamless evaluation, deployment, and
simple pipeline creation for heterogeneous biometric software. FaRO2
additionally provides a fully declarative capability for defining and
coordinating custom machine learning and sensor pipelines, allowing the
distribution of processes across otherwise incompatible hardware and networks.
FaRO2 ultimately provides a way to quickly configure, hot-swap, and expand
large coordinated or federated systems online without interruptions for
maintenance. Because much of the data collected in a smart city contains
Personally Identifying Information (PII), FaRO2 also provides built-in tools
and layers to ensure secure and encrypted streaming, storage, and access of PII

efficiency and tightness of column generation (CG) methods for solving vehicle
routing problems (VRP). LA-routes rely on pre-computing the lowest cost
elementary sub-route (called an LA-arc) for each tuple consisting of the
following: (1) a (first) customer where the LA-arc begins, (2) a distant
customer (from the first) where the LA-arc ends, and (3) a set of intermediate
customers near the first customer. LA-routes are constructed by concatenating
LA-arcs where the final customer in a given LA-arc is the first customer in the
subsequent LA-arc. A Decremental State Space Relaxation method is applied over
LA-routes to construct the lowest reduced cost elementary route during the
pricing step of CG. LA-route based solvers can be used to efficiently tighten
the standard set cover VRP using a variant of subset row inequalities, which do
not alter the structure of pricing. We incorporate LA-arcs into a novel CG
stabilization scheme. Specifically each column generated during pricing is
mapped to an ordered list of customers consistent with that column. An LA-arc
is consistent with an ordering if the first/last customer in the arc come
before/after all other customers in the LA-arc in the associated ordering
respectively. Each such ordering is then mapped to a multi-graph where nodes
correspond to (customer/demand) and edges correspond to LA-arcs consistent with
that ordering. Hence any path from source to sink on the multi-graph is a
feasible elementary route. The ordering for a column places customers spatially
nearby in nearby positions on the ordering so that routes can be generated so
as to permit spatially nearby customers to be visited without traveling far
away first. We solve the restricted master problem over these graphs, which has
special structure allowing for fast solution.

arises from Cooper pairing in the singlet channel. Whereas a triplet Cooper

a hallmark of unconventional superconductivity. In multilayer graphene, the
nature of the pairing instability is further complicated by emergent orders in
the momentum-space, such as valley and momentum polarization. The presence of
momentum-space instability suggests that the spin channel alone is insufficient
to describe the superconducting pairing symmetry. In this work, we use
angle-resolved nonreciprocal transport measurement to investigate the influence
of momentum-space instabilities. We uncover a new cascade phenomenon across the
moir\'e band fillings, where a series of transitions between momentum-polarized
states appear outside the regular sequence of Dirac revivals. Moreover, we
identify a new aspect of superconductivity, which is defined by its coexistence
with spontaneous momentum polarization. Our findings point towards a direct
link between spontaneously broken rotational and time-reversal symmetries,
which has intriguing implications on the nature of the pairing instability.

between emitters via dissipation. This leads to the release of all the energy

fluctuation that triggers the emission is amplified throughout the decay

spontaneous symmetry breaking, where most photons are emitted into either the
left- or the right-propagating optical modes, giving rise to an emergent
chirality. Superradiant bursts may be a smoking gun for the generation of
correlated photon states of exotic quantum statistics. This physics can be
explored in diverse setups, ranging from atoms close to nanofibers to
superconducting qubits coupled to transmission lines.

It is important to systematically study these interrelations, to determine
which ones have significant effects, and whether the effects are adverse or
beneficial. Our recently developed epidemic model with agent-based and
geographical elements is used in this study for such a purpose. We perform an
extensive parameter space exploration of the socio-economic part of the model,
including factors like the attitudes (called values) of the agents towards the
disease spreading, health, economic situation, and regulations by government
agents. We search for prominent patterns from the resulting simulated data
using basic classification tools, namely self-organizing maps and principal
component analysis. We seek to isolate the most important value parameters of
the population and government agents influencing the disease spreading speed
and patterns, and monitor different quantities of the model output, such as
infection rates, the propagation speed of the epidemic, economic activity,
government regulations, and the compliance of population. Out of these, the
ones describing the epidemic spreading were resulting in the most distinctive
clustering of the data, and they were selected as the basis of the remaining
analysis. We relate the found clusters to three distinct types of disease
spreading: wave-like, chaotic, and transitional spreading patterns. The most
important value parameter contributing to phase changes between these phases
was found to be the compliance of the population agents towards the government
regulations.

a factor of 2.25x for 3x3 convolutions when using the version with 2x2-sized
tiles $F_2$. Even though the gain is significant, the Winograd algorithm with
larger tile sizes, i.e., $F_4$, offers even more potential in improving
throughput and energy efficiency, as it reduces the required MACs by 4x.
Unfortunately, the Winograd algorithm with larger tile sizes introduces
numerical issues that prevent its use on integer domain-specific accelerators
and higher computational overhead to transform input and output data between
spatial and Winograd domains.
  To unlock the full potential of Winograd $F_4$, we propose a novel tap-wise

glued using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to give a stable membrane. Fabricated
membranes improved the Allura red rejection from 8.29 $\pm$ 0.69% in the
controls (sandwiched wood sheets without rGO) to 93.14 $\pm$ 1.31% in the 1 mL
total rGO composites. The ratio of percentage permeance drop of the treatments
over the controls ranged from 62.8 $\pm$ 4.3 to 85.4 $\pm$ 5.2% from the 0.4 to
1 mL rGO composites respectively. The correlation coefficient (r) between the
GO volume and rejection was 0.94 suggesting that the GO treatments provided
some control over the transport of molecules through the membrane. The
correlation coefficient between wood thickness, and Allura red rejection shows
that the wood sheets did not influence the rejection. The permeance was weakly
affected by the membrane thickness (r = -0.46). An 93% improvement in rejection
performance of the composite membranes over the controls was observed. The
overall data suggests that the wood-rGO composite has potential for water
filtration applications.

particle populations. The polytropic index, ${\gamma}$, is particularly
important as it describes the thermodynamic behavior of the system by
quantifying the changes in temperature as the system is compressed or expanded.
Using Wind spacecraft plasma and magnetic field data during $01/1995 -
12/2018$, we investigate the thermodynamic evolution in 336 Interplanetary
Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME) events. For each event, we derive the index
${\gamma}$ in the sheath and magnetic ejecta structures, along with the pre-
and post- event regions. We then examine the distributions of all ${\gamma}$
indices in these four regions and derive the entropic gradient of each, which
is indicative of the ambient heating. We find that in the ICME sheath region,
where wave turbulence is expected to be highest, the thermodynamics takes
longest to recover into the original quasi-adiabatic process, while it recovers
faster in the quieter ejecta region. This pattern creates a thermodynamic
cycle, featuring a near adiabatic value ${\gamma}$ ~ ${\gamma}$${_a}$ (=5/3)
upstream of the ICMEs, ${\gamma}$${_a}$ - ${\gamma}$ ~ 0.26 in the sheaths,
${\gamma}$${_a}$ - ${\gamma}$ ~ 0.13 in the ICME ejecta, and recovers again to
${\gamma}$ ~ ${\gamma}$${_a}$ after the passage of the ICME. These results
expose the turbulent heating rates in the ICME plasma: the lower the polytropic
index from its adiabatic value and closer to its isothermal value, the larger
the entropic gradient, and thus, the rate of turbulent heating that heats the
ICME plasma.

ports generated in an attacker-prescribed manner. These hash collisions depend
solely on a per-device key, and thus the set of collisions forms a device ID

areas easier compared to field surveying especially if the remote sensed data
can be automatically analyzed. An important aspect of monitoring is classifying
and mapping habitat types present in the monitored area. Automatic
classification is a difficult task, as classes have fine-grained differences
and their distributions are long-tailed and unbalanced. Usually training data
used for automatic land cover classification relies on fully annotated
segmentation maps, annotated from remote sensed imagery to a fairly high-level
taxonomy, i.e., classes such as forest, farmland, or urban area. A challenge
with automatic habitat classification is that reliable data annotation requires
field-surveys. Therefore, full segmentation maps are expensive to produce, and
training data is often sparse, point-like, and limited to areas accessible by
foot. Methods for utilizing these limited data more efficiently are needed.
  We address these problems by proposing a method for habitat classification
and mapping, and apply this method to classify the entire northern Finnish
Lapland area into Natura2000 classes. The method is characterized by using
finely-grained, sparse, single-pixel annotations collected from the field,
combined with large amounts of unannotated data to produce segmentation maps.
Supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised methods are compared, and the
benefits of transfer learning from a larger out-of-domain dataset are
demonstrated. We propose a \ac{CNN} biased towards center pixel classification
ensembled with a random forest classifier, that produces higher quality
classifications than the models themselves alone. We show that cropping
augmentations, test-time augmentation and semi-supervised learning can help
classification even further.

been well studied, especially when there is informative cluster size (ICS). The
purpose of this study is to describe different imputation and analysis
strategies for the multilevel ordinal outcome when ICS exists. We conducted
comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation studies to compare five different methods:
complete case analysis (CCA), FCS, FCS+CS (include cluster size (CS) when
performing the imputation), JM, and JM+CS under different scenarios. We
evaluated their performances using an proportional odds logistic regression
model estimated with cluster weighted generalized estimating equations (CWGEE).
The simulation results show that including cluster size in imputation can
significantly improve imputation accuracy when ICS exists. FCS provides more
accurate and robust estimation than JM, followed by CCA for multilevel ordinal
outcomes. We further applied those methods to a real dental study.

  Instructions","Needs to improve and polish",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditional urban planning demands urban experts to spend considerable time
and effort producing an optimal urban plan under many architectural
constraints. The remarkable imaginative ability of deep generative learning
provides hope for renovating urban planning. While automated urban planners
have been examined, they are constrained because of the following: 1)
neglecting human requirements in urban planning; 2) omitting spatial
hierarchies in urban planning, and 3) lacking numerous urban plan data samples.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, deep, human-instructed urban
planner. In the preliminary work, we formulate it into an encoder-decoder
paradigm. The encoder is to learn the information distribution of surrounding
contexts, human instructions, and land-use configuration. The decoder is to
reconstruct the land-use configuration and the associated urban functional
zones. The reconstruction procedure will capture the spatial hierarchies
between functional zones and spatial grids. Meanwhile, we introduce a
variational Gaussian mechanism to mitigate the data sparsity issue. Even though
early work has led to good results, the performance of generation is still
unstable because the way spatial hierarchies are captured may lead to unclear
optimization directions. In this journal version, we propose a cascading deep
generative framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to solve
this problem, inspired by the workflow of urban experts. In particular, the
purpose of the first GAN is to build urban functional zones based on
information from human instructions and surrounding contexts. The second GAN
will produce the land-use configuration based on the functional zones that have
been constructed. Additionally, we provide a conditioning augmentation module
to augment data samples. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to validate

candidate counterparts to BBH mergers mergers during O3 (seven in O3a, two in
O3b) with a $p$-value of 0.019. Based on ZTF sky coverage, AGN geometry, and
merger geometry, we expect $\approx 3(N_{\rm BBH}/83)(f_{\rm AGN}/0.5)$
potentially detectable EM counterparts from O3, where $N_{\rm BBH}$ is the
total number of observed BBH mergers and $f_{\rm AGN}$ is the fraction
originating in AGN. Further modeling of breakout and flaring phenomena in AGN
disks is required to reduce our false positive rate. Two of the events are also
associated with mergers with total masses $> 100M_\odot$, which is the expected
rate for O3 if hierarchical (large mass) mergers occur in the AGN channel.
Candidate EM counterparts in future GW observing runs can be better constrained
by coverage of the Southern sky as well as spectral monitoring of unusual AGN
flaring events in LIGO/Virgo alert volumes. A future set of reliable AGN EM
counterparts to BBH mergers will yield an independent means of measuring cosmic
expansion ($H_0$) as a function of redshift.

the agreement between the reference annotation and the predicted segmentation.
Usually, overlap metrics, such as the Dice, are used as a metric to evaluate
the performance of these models in order for results to be comparable. However,
there is a mismatch between the distributions of cases and difficulty level of
segmentation tasks in public data sets compared to clinical practice. Common
metrics fail to measure the impact of this mismatch, especially for clinical
data sets that include low signal pathologies, a difficult segmentation task,
and uncertain, small, or empty reference annotations. This limitation may
result in ineffective research of machine learning practitioners in designing
and optimizing models. Dimensions of evaluating clinical value include
consideration of the uncertainty of reference annotations, independence from
reference annotation volume size, and evaluation of classification of empty
reference annotations. We study how uncertain, small, and empty reference
annotations influence the value of metrics for medical image segmentation on an
in-house data set regardless of the model. We examine metrics behavior on the
predictions of a standard deep learning framework in order to identify metrics
with clinical value. We compare to a public benchmark data set (BraTS 2019)
with a high-signal pathology and certain, larger, and no empty reference
annotations. We may show machine learning practitioners, how uncertain, small,

time process to burn all the points of $P$ where fires must be initiated at the

burnt point from $P$, and at each subsequent step, burns all the points in the
plane that are within one unit distance from the currently burnt points, as
well as one other unburnt point of $P$ (if exists). The point burning number of
$P$ is the smallest number of steps required to burn all the points of $P$. If
we allow the fire to be initiated anywhere, then the burning process is called
an anywhere burning process, and the corresponding burning number is called
anywhere burning number. Computing the point and anywhere burning number is
known to be NP-hard. In this paper we show that both these problems admit PTAS
in one dimension. We then show that in two dimensions, point burning and
anywhere burning are $(1.96296+\varepsilon)$ and $(1.92188+\varepsilon)$

that a known result on set cover problem can be leveraged to obtain a

experience based and human labor dependent, which limits the processing speed.
So far, the low signal-noise ratio and the low jump ratio of the core-loss
edges on the raw EELS spectra have been challenging for the automation of edge
recognition. In this work, a convolutional-bidirectional long short-term memory
neural network (CNN-BiLSTM) is proposed to automate the detection and elemental
identification of core-loss edges from raw spectra. An EELS spectral database
is synthesized by using our forward model to assist in the training and
validation of the neural network. To make the synthesized spectra resemble the
real spectra, we collected a large library of experimentally acquired EELS core
edges. In synthesize the training library, the edges are modeled by fitting the
multi-gaussian model to the real edges from experiments, and the noise and
instrumental imperfectness are simulated and added. The well-trained CNN-BiLSTM
network is tested against both the simulated spectra and real spectra collected
from experiments. The high accuracy of the network, 94.9 %, proves that,
without complicated preprocessing of the raw spectra, the proposed CNN-BiLSTM

objects, which we call totems, into a scene so as to protect any photograph

defender can use these distorted totem pixels to detect if an image has been
manipulated. Our approach unscrambles the light rays passing through the totems
by estimating their positions in the scene and using their known geometric and
material properties. To verify a totem-protected image, we detect
inconsistencies between the scene reconstructed from totem viewpoints and the
scene's appearance from the camera viewpoint. Such an approach makes the
adversarial manipulation task more difficult, as the adversary must modify both
the totem and image pixels in a geometrically consistent manner without knowing
the physical properties of the totem. Unlike prior learning-based approaches,
our method does not require training on datasets of specific manipulations, and
instead uses physical properties of the scene and camera to solve the forensics

and reversible fast optical switching by using a pump-probe laser excitation
setup. More specifically, transmission is blocked for high intensity probe
lasers due to the VO2 metallic properties induced at elevated temperatures
while at low probe laser intensities high transmission through the filter
occurs only for a narrowband IR range confined to near normal incident angles.
The proposed multilayer composite dielectric filter is expected to have
applications in optical communications, where it can act as dual functional
infrared filter and optical switch.

can be insufficient given the inter-sample variability of experimental

probabilities of constitutive models based on biaxial mechanical testing of
tissue samples. 46 samples of porcine aortic valve tissue were tested using a
biaxial stretching setup. For each sample, seven ratios of stresses along and
perpendicular to the fiber direction were applied. The probabilities of eight
invariant-based constitutive models were calculated based on the experimental
data using the proposed model selection framework. The calculated probabilities
showed that, out of the considered models and based on the information
available through the utilized experimental dataset, the May--Newman model was
the most probable model for the porcine aortic valve data. When the samples
were grouped into different cusp types, the May--Newman model remained the most
probable for the left- and right-coronary cusps, whereas for non-coronary cusps
two models were found to be equally probable: the Lee--Sacks model and the
May--Newman model. This difference between cusp types was found to be
associated with the first principal component analysis (PCA) mode, where this
mode's amplitudes of the non-coronary and right-coronary cusps were found to be
significantly different. Our results show that a PCA-based statistical model

operating as a team or swarm, is affected by their individual capabilities,
which in turn is dependent on their physical design, aka morphology. However,
with the exception of a few (albeit ad hoc) evolutionary robotics methods,
there has been very little work on understanding the interplay of morphology
and collective behavior. There is especially a lack of computational frameworks
to concurrently search for the robot morphology and the hyper-parameters of
their behavior model that jointly optimize the collective (team) performance.
To address this gap, this paper proposes a new co-design framework. Here the
exploding computational cost of an otherwise nested morphology/behavior
co-design is effectively alleviated through the novel concept of ``talent""
metrics; while also allowing significantly better solutions compared to the
typically sub-optimal sequential morphology$\to$behavior design approach. This
framework comprises four major steps: talent metrics selection, talent Pareto
exploration (a multi-objective morphology optimization process), behavior
optimization, and morphology finalization. This co-design concept is
demonstrated by applying it to design UAVs that operate as a team to localize
signal sources, e.g., in victim search and hazard localization. Here, the
collective behavior is driven by a recently reported batch Bayesian search
algorithm called Bayes-Swarm. Our case studies show that the outcome of
co-design provides significantly higher success rates in signal source
localization compared to a baseline design, across a variety of signal
environments and teams with 6 to 15 UAVs. Moreover, this co-design process
provides two orders of magnitude reduction in computing time compared to a
projected nested design approach.

generating controlled synthetic data from a minimal model where the importance
of contacts and of phylogeny can be tuned. We demonstrate that global inference
methods, specifically Potts models, are more resilient to phylogenetic
correlations than local methods, based on covariance or mutual information.
This holds whether or not phylogenetic corrections are used, and may explain
the success of global methods. We analyse the roles of selection strength and
of phylogenetic relatedness. We show that sites that mutate early in the

highlight the impact of phylogeny on contact prediction from protein sequences

Q-learning outperforms behavioral cloning (BC). Yet, a vanilla combination of
both hurts performance. Concretely, we see that the BC loss only helps when
selectively applied to actions that get the agent closer to the goal according
to the Q-function. Our framework also explains the puzzling phenomenon wherein

attention is to provide transversely shaped electron beams for emittance
exchange that translates a transverse electron beam pattern into a longitudinal

reliable and consistent production of transversely shaped beams is affected by
material properties of the FEC. This paper reports the results of testing two

emitter geometry but different material and tip characteristics. Although both
cathodes were able to sustain gradients of 44 MV/m and produce maximum output
integral charge of 0.5 nC per radiofrequency (rf) pulse, their emission

patterned beam production were explained by the differences in the tip geometry

be that the tip sharpness was not a prerequisite for good patterned beam
production. Instead, other material characteristics, such as the ballast

to time-driven inter-sampling effects, thus also eliminating the need for
selecting the size of time steps. Simulation examples are included to compare
the two new schemes and to illustrate how overall infeasibilities can be
significantly reduced while at the same time reducing the need for
communication among CAVs without compromising performance.

super-resolution (SR) with fixed scales. To increase its real world
applicability, numerous models have also been proposed to restore SR images

resized to different scales along horizontal and vertical directions. Though
most models are only optimized for the unidirectional upscaling task while
assuming a predefined downscaling kernel for low-resolution (LR) inputs, recent
models based on Invertible Neural Networks (INN) are able to increase upscaling
accuracy significantly by optimizing the downscaling and upscaling cycle
jointly. However, limited by the INN architecture, it is constrained to fixed
integer scale factors and requires one model for each scale. Without increasing
model complexity, a simple and effective invertible arbitrary rescaling network
(IARN) is proposed to achieve arbitrary image rescaling by training only one

encoding and preemptive channel splitting, the network is optimized to convert
the non-invertible rescaling cycle to an effectively invertible process. It is
shown to achieve a state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in bidirectional
arbitrary rescaling without compromising perceptual quality in LR outputs. It
is also demonstrated to perform well on tests with asymmetric scales using the

first hours, observations are consistent with a self-similar expansion but
later on the front flattens forming a dimple. Our interpretation is that the
CME becomes deformed at $\sim0.1\ au$ due to differences in the background
solar wind speeds. The CME expands more at higher latitudes, where the
background solar wind is faster. We consider other possible causes for
deformations, such as loss of coherence and slow-mode shocks. The CME
deformation seems to cause a time-of-arrival error of 16 hours at $\sim 0.5\

would have been missed by 1~AU coronagraphs. Such deformations may help explain
the time-of-arrival errors in events where only coronagraph observations are

Here we present an ultra-low power radio-frequency (RF) multiplexing

interfacing of superconducting qubits with minimal cross-coupling. We benchmark
its performance by interfacing it with a superconducting qubit and observe that

($T_2$) are only minimally affected in both static and dynamic operation. Using
the multiplexer, single qubit gate fidelities above 99.9%, i.e., well above the

appropriate thermal filtering. In addition, we demonstrate the capability of
time-division-multiplexed qubit control by dynamically windowing calibrated

phenotypic diversity in nature. Most traits of interest, such as those relating
to morphology, life-history, immunity and behaviour are quantitative, and
phenotypic variation is driven by the cumulative effects of genetic and
environmental variation. The field of quantitative genetics aims to quantify
the additive genetic component of this trait variance (i.e. the
""heritability""), often with the underlying assumption that trait variance is
driven by many loci of infinitesimal effects throughout the genome. This
approach allows us to understand the evolutionary potential of natural
populations and can be extended to examine the genetic covariation with fitness
to predict responses to selection. Therefore, quantitative genetic studies are
fundamental to understanding evolution in the wild. Over the last two decades,
there has been a wealth of studies investigating trait heritabilities and
genetic correlations, but these were initially limited to long-term studies of
pedigreed populations or common-garden experiments. However, genomic
technologies have since allowed quantitative genetic studies in a more diverse
range of wild systems and has increased the opportunities for addressing
outstanding questions in ecology and evolution. In particular, genomic studies
can uncover the genetic basis of fitness-related quantitative traits, allowing
a better understanding of their evolutionary dynamics. We organised this

using mixture of experts poses two new problems, namely (i) assigning the
correct expert at inference time when a new unseen sample is presented. (ii)
Finding the optimal partitioning of the training data, such that the experts
rely the least on common features. In Dynamic Routing (DR) a novel architecture
is proposed where each layer is composed of a set of experts, however without
addressing the two challenges we demonstrate that the model reverts to using
the same subset of experts.
  In our method, Diversified Dynamic Routing (DivDR) the model is explicitly
trained to solve the challenge of finding relevant partitioning of the data and
assigning the correct experts in an unsupervised approach. We conduct several
experiments on semantic segmentation on Cityscapes and object detection and
instance segmentation on MS-COCO showing improved performance over several
baselines.

near-infrared wavelengths, along with slitless near-infrared spectroscopy,
across ~15,000 sq deg of the sky. Euclid is expected to detect ~12 billion
astronomical sources, facilitating new insights into cosmology, galaxy
evolution, and various other topics. To optimally exploit the expected very
large data set, there is the need to develop appropriate methods and software.
Here we present a novel machine-learning based methodology for selection of
quiescent galaxies using broad-band Euclid I_E, Y_E, J_E, H_E photometry, in
combination with multiwavelength photometry from other surveys. The ARIADNE
pipeline uses meta-learning to fuse decision-tree ensembles,
nearest-neighbours, and deep-learning methods into a single classifier that
yields significantly higher accuracy than any of the individual learning
methods separately. The pipeline has `sparsity-awareness', so that missing
photometry values are still informative for the classification. Our pipeline
derives photometric redshifts for galaxies selected as quiescent, aided by the
`pseudo-labelling' semi-supervised method. After application of the outlier
filter, our pipeline achieves a normalized mean absolute deviation of ~< 0.03
and a fraction of catastrophic outliers of ~< 0.02 when measured against the
COSMOS2015 photometric redshifts. We apply our classification pipeline to mock
galaxy photometry catalogues corresponding to three main scenarios: (i) Euclid
Deep Survey with ancillary ugriz, WISE, and radio data; (ii) Euclid Wide Survey
with ancillary ugriz, WISE, and radio data; (iii) Euclid Wide Survey only. Our
classification pipeline outperforms UVJ selection, in addition to the Euclid
I_E-Y_E, J_E-H_E and u-I_E,I_E-J_E colour-colour methods, with improvements in
completeness and the F1-score of up to a factor of 2. (Abridged)

prove non-asymptotic upper bounds on the mean-squared error of such procedures:
these bounds reveal that in order to obtain non-asymptotically optimal
procedures, the error in estimating the treatment effect should be minimized in
a certain weighted $L^2$-norm. We analyze a two-stage procedure based on
constrained regression in this weighted norm, and establish its
instance-dependent optimality in finite samples via matching non-asymptotic
local minimax lower bounds. These results show that the optimal non-asymptotic

depends on the weighted norm distance between the true outcome function and its

relatively new AI technique designed to enhance data privacy by decentralizing
traditional machine learning modeling. However, traditional federated learning
requires identical architectural models to be trained across the local clients
and global servers. This limits global model architecture due to the lack of
local models heterogeneity. To overcome this, a novel federated learning
architecture, FedStack, which supports ensembling heterogeneous architectural
client models was proposed in this study. This work offers a protected privacy
system for hospitalized in-patients in a decentralized approach and identifies
optimum sensor placement. The proposed architecture was applied to a mobile
health sensor benchmark dataset from 10 different subjects to classify 12
routine activities. Three AI models, ANN, CNN, and Bi-LSTM were trained on
individual subject data. The federated learning architecture was applied to
these models to build local and global models capable of state of the art
performances. The local CNN model outperformed ANN and Bi-LSTM models on each
subject data. Our proposed work has demonstrated better performance for
heterogeneous stacking of the local models compared to homogeneous stacking.

to lease software to a user by encoding it into a quantum state. Secure
software leasing has a mechanism that verifies whether a returned software is
valid or not. The security notion guarantees that once a user returns a
software in a valid form, the user no longer uses the software.
  In this work, we introduce the notion of secret-key functional encryption
(SKFE) with secure key leasing, where a decryption key can be securely leased
in the sense of secure software leasing. We also instantiate it with standard
cryptographic assumptions. More specifically, our contribution is as follows.
  - We define the syntax and security definitions for SKFE with secure key
leasing.
  - We achieve a transformation from standard SKFE into SKFE with secure key
leasing without using additional assumptions. Especially, we obtain bounded
collusion-resistant SKFE for P/poly with secure key leasing based on
post-quantum one-way functions since we can instantiate bounded
collusion-resistant SKFE for P/poly with the assumption.
  Some previous secure software leasing schemes capture only pirate software
that runs on an honest evaluation algorithm (on a legitimate platform).
However, our secure key leasing notion captures arbitrary attack strategies and
does not have such a limitation.
  We also introduce the notion of single-decryptor FE (SDFE), where each
functional decryption key is copy-protected. Since copy-protection is a
stronger primitive than secure software leasing, this notion can be seen as a
stronger cryptographic primitive than FE with secure key leasing. More
specifically:
  - We define the syntax and security definitions for SDFE.
  - We achieve collusion-resistant single-decryptor PKFE for P/poly from
post-quantum indistinguishability obfuscation and quantum hardness of the
learning with errors problem.

optimizing an imperfect proxy reward function, $\mathcal{\tilde{R}}$, leads to
poor performance according to the true reward function, $\mathcal{R}$. We say
that a proxy is unhackable if increasing the expected proxy return can never
decrease the expected true return. Intuitively, it might be possible to create
an unhackable proxy by leaving some terms out of the reward function (making it
""narrower"") or overlooking fine-grained distinctions between roughly equivalent
outcomes, but we show this is usually not the case. A key insight is that the
linearity of reward (in state-action visit counts) makes unhackability a very
strong condition. In particular, for the set of all stochastic policies, two
reward functions can only be unhackable if one of them is constant. We thus
turn our attention to deterministic policies and finite sets of stochastic
policies, where non-trivial unhackable pairs always exist, and establish
necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of simplifications, an
important special case of unhackability. Our results reveal a tension between

characterizing the burst properties and guiding the follow-up observations.
Localization based on the relative counts of different detectors has been
widely used for all-sky gamma-ray monitors. There are two major methods for
this counts distribution localization: $\chi^{2}$ minimization method and the
Bayesian method. Here we propose a modified Bayesian method that could take
advantage of both the accuracy of the Bayesian method and the simplicity of the
$\chi^{2}$ method. With comprehensive simulations, we find that our Bayesian
method with Poisson likelihood is generally more applicable for various bursts
than $\chi^{2}$ method, especially for weak bursts. We further proposed a
location-spectrum iteration approach based on the Bayesian inference, which
could alleviate the problems caused by the spectral difference between the
burst and location templates. Our method is very suitable for scenarios with
limited computation resources or time-sensitive applications, such as in-flight
localization software, and low-latency localization for rapid follow-up
observations.

object possesses a peculiar neutral color of $g-r = 0.45\pm0.05$ and
$g-i=0.72\pm0.06$, in comparison with other distant trans-Neptunian objects,
all of which have moderate-red to ultra-red colors. A numerical integration
based on orbital fitting on astrometric data covering eight years of arc
confirms that 2016 SD$_{106}$ is a metastable object without significant
scattering evolution. Each of the clones survived at the end of the 1 Gyr
simulation. However, very few neutral objects with inclinations $<5^{\circ}$
have been found in the outer solar system, even in the main Kuiper belt.
Furthermore, most mechanisms which lift perihelion distances are expected to
produce a very low number of extreme objects with inclinations $<5^{\circ}$. We
thus explored the possibility that a hypothetical distant planet could increase
the production of such objects. Our simulations show that no 2016
SD$_{106}$-like orbits can be produced from three Kuiper belt populations
tested (i.e. plutinos, twotinos, and Haumea Family) without the presence of an
hypothetical planet, while a few similar orbits can be obtained with it;
however, the presence of the additional planet produces a wide range of large
semimajor-axis / large perihelion objects, in apparent contradiction with the
observed scarcity of objects in those regions of phase space. Future studies
may determine if there is a connection between the existence of a perihelion
gap and a particular orbital configuration of an hypothetical distant planet.

\textit{Targeted repair} identifies and repairs parts of the existing solution

algorithmic contributions, we provide theoretical insights into the inherent
trade-off between time and resource optimality in these settings and derive
meaningful bounds on schedule suboptimality.

combining the estimated uncertainty with a rejection-based approach increases
classification accuracy from 0.86 to 0.95 while retaining 75% of the test set.

activity for 3.6 million M dwarf stars within 1 kpc of the Sun. For this
purpose, we identify 906 unique flare events as a proxy for magnetic activity
from the SkyMapper Southern Survey DR3. We adopt vertical distance $|Z|$ from
the Galactic disc as a proxy for age and confirm a strong trend of flaring
fraction decreasing with growing stellar age. Among M dwarfs within 50 pc of
the Sun, we find a flaring fraction of 1-in-1,500, independent of spectral type
from M2 to M7, suggesting that these stars are all in a flare-saturated young
evolutionary stage. We find a hint of a kink in the slope of the overall flare
fraction near 100 pc from the plane, where a steep decline begins; this slope
change is visible for mid-type M dwarfs (M3--M5), suggesting it is not an
artefact of mixing spectral type. Together with SDSS H$\alpha$ emission, this
trend is additional evidence that the activity fraction of M dwarfs depends on
Galactic height and activity lifetime. While there is a hint of flattening of
the overall activity fraction above $|Z|\approx$ 500 pc, our data do not
constrain this further. Within $\sim$500 pc distance from the Sun, we find no
sign of radial disk gradients in flare activity, which may only be revealed by
samples covering a larger radial range.

  Sensing",,,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Millimeter wave sensing has recently attracted a lot of attention given its
environmental robust nature. In situations where visual sensors like cameras
fail to perform, mmwave radars can be used to achieve reliable performance.
However, because of the poor scattering performance and lack of texture in
millimeter waves, radars can not be used in several situations that require
precise identification of objects. In this paper, we take insight from camera
fiducials which are very easily identifiable by the camera, and present
R-fiducial tags, which smartly augment the current infrastructure to enable a
myriad of applications with mmwave radars. R-fiducial acts as a fiducial for
mmwave sensing, similar to camera fiducials, and can be reliably identified by
a mmwave radar. We identify a precise list of requirements that a millimeter
wave fiducial has to follow and show how R-fiducial achieves all of them.
R-fiducial uses a novel spread-spectrum modulation technique that provides low
latency with high reliability. Our evaluations show that R-fiducial can be
reliably detected upto 25m and upto 120 degrees field of view with a latency of
the order of milliseconds. We also conduct experiments and case studies in
adverse and low visibility conditions to showcase the applicability of
R-fiducial in a wide range of applications.

limited capacity and high power consumption. Non-volatile memory (NVM) is an
alternative to DRAM, but it has high latency and low bandwidth. We observe that
the VM with heterogeneous memory may incur up to a $1.5\times$ slowdown
compared to a DRAM VM, if not managed well. However, none of the
state-of-the-art heterogeneous memory management designs are customized for
virtualization on a real system.
  In this paper, we propose HMM-V, a Heterogeneous Memory Management system for
Virtualization. HMM-V automatically determines page hotness and migrates pages
between DRAM and NVM to achieve performance close to the DRAM system. First,
HMM-V tracks memory accesses through page table manipulation, but reduces the
cost by leveraging Intel page-modification logging (PML) and a multi-level
queue. Second, HMM-V quantifies the ``temperature'' of page and determines the
hot set with bucket-sorting. HMM-V then efficiently migrates pages with minimal
access pause and handles dirty pages with the assistance of PML. Finally, HMM-V
provides pooling management to balance precious DRAM across multiple VMs to
maximize utilization and overall performance. HMM-V is implemented on a real
system with Intel Optane DC persistent memory. The four-VM co-running results
show that HMM-V outperforms NUMA balancing and hardware management (Intel
Optane memory mode) by $51\%$ and $31\%$, respectively.

development of secondary sex characteristics which has been a key interest in
the field of speech analysis. This research investigated a broad range of
acoustic features from scripted and spontaneous speech and applied a
hierarchical clustering-based machine learning model to distinguish the sex of
children aged between 5 and 15 years. We proposed an optimal feature set and
our modelling achieved an average F1 score (the harmonic mean of the precision
and recall) of 0.84 across all ages. Our results suggest that the sex
classification is generally more accurate when a model is developed for each
year group rather than for children in 4-year age bands, with classification
accuracy being better for older age groups. We found that spontaneous speech
could provide more helpful cues in sex classification than scripted speech,
especially for children younger than 7 years. For younger age groups, a broad
range of acoustic factors contributed evenly to sex classification, while for
older age groups, F0-related acoustic factors were found to be the most
critical predictors generally. Other important acoustic factors for older age
groups include vocal tract length estimators, spectral flux, loudness and
unvoiced features.

very attractive for model robustness analysis, since its independence of input
reveals the intrinsic characteristics of the model. Relatively, another
interesting observation is Neural Collapse (NC), which means the feature
variability may collapse during the terminal phase of training. Motivated by
this, we propose to generate UAP by attacking the layer where NC phenomenon
happens. Because of NC, the proposed attack could gather all the natural
images' features to its surrounding, which is hence called Feature-Gathering
UAP (FG-UAP).
  We evaluate the effectiveness our proposed algorithm on abundant experiments,
including untargeted and targeted universal attacks, attacks under limited
dataset, and transfer-based black-box attacks among different architectures
including Vision Transformers, which are believed to be more robust.
Furthermore, we investigate FG-UAP in the view of NC by analyzing the labels
and extracted features of adversarial examples, finding that collapse
phenomenon becomes stronger after the model is corrupted. The code will be
released when the paper is accepted.

approach to address the heterogeneity issue of the datasets generated by

rely on synchronous training to ensure good convergence performances, which may
lead to a serious straggler problem, where the training time is heavily
prolonged by the slowest UE. To address this issue, we propose a
semi-synchronous PFL algorithm, termed as Semi-Synchronous Personalized
FederatedAveraging (PerFedS$^2$), over mobile edge networks. By jointly
optimizing the wireless bandwidth allocation and UE scheduling policy, it not
only mitigates the straggler problem but also provides convergent training loss
guarantees. We derive an upper bound of the convergence rate of PerFedS2 in
terms of the number of participants per global round and the number of rounds.
On this basis, the bandwidth allocation problem can be solved using analytical
solutions and the UE scheduling policy can be obtained by a greedy algorithm.
Experimental results verify the effectiveness of PerFedS2 in saving training
time as well as guaranteeing the convergence of training loss, in contrast to
synchronous and asynchronous PFL algorithms.

object and the scene, as different/same object actions in same/different scenes
may lead to various degrees of normality and anomaly. Therefore, object-scene
relation actually plays a crucial role in anomaly detection but is inadequately
explored in previous works. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal
Relation Learning (STRL) framework to tackle the video anomaly detection task.
First, considering dynamic characteristics of the objects as well as scene
areas, we construct a Spatio-Temporal Auto-Encoder (STAE) to jointly exploit
spatial and temporal evolution patterns for representation learning. For better
pattern extraction, two decoding branches are designed in the STAE module, i.e.
an appearance branch capturing spatial cues by directly predicting the next
frame, and a motion branch focusing on modeling the dynamics via optical flow
prediction. Then, to well concretize the object-scene relation, a Relation
Learning (RL) module is devised to analyze and summarize the normal relations
by introducing the Knowledge Graph Embedding methodology. Specifically in this
process, the plausibility of object-scene relation is measured by jointly
modeling object/scene features and optimizable object-scene relation maps.
Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, and the superior
performance over the state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the effectiveness of
our method.

approach used for covariate adaptive randomization when the number of strata is
large in a clinical trial. It aims to achieve a balanced allocation of
treatment groups at the marginal levels of some prespecified and discrete
stratification factors. Valid statistical inference with data collected under
covariate adaptive randomization requires the knowledge of the limiting
covariance matrix of within-stratum imbalances. The existence of the limit
under the marginal design is recently established, which can be estimated by
Monte Carlo simulations when the distribution of the stratification factors is
known. This assumption may not hold, however, in practice. In this work, we
propose to replace the usually unknown distribution with an estimator, such as
the empirical distribution, in the Monte Carlo approach and establish its
consistency, in particular, by Le Cam's third lemma. As an application, we
consider in simulation studies adjustments to existing robust tests for
treatment effects with survival data by the proposed covariances estimator. It
shows that the adjusted tests achieve a size close to the nominal level, and
unlike other designs, the robust tests without adjustment may have an
asymptotic size inflation issue under the marginal design.

Quantitative extraction of orientation information from P-RSoXS pattern data is
challenging because the scattering processes originate from sample properties
that must be represented as energy-dependent three-dimensional tensors with
heterogeneities at nanometer to sub-nanometer length scales. We overcome this
challenge by developing an open-source virtual instrument that uses GPUs to
simulate P-RSoXS patterns from real-space material representations with
nanoscale resolution. Our computational framework CyRSoXS
(https://github.com/usnistgov/cyrsoxs) is designed to maximize GPU performance.
We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our approach by validating
against an extensive set of test cases, which include both analytical solutions
and numerical comparisons, demonstrating a speedup of over three orders
relative to the current state-of-the-art simulation software. Such fast
simulations open up a variety of applications that were previously
computationally infeasible, including (a) pattern fitting, (b) co-simulation
with the physical instrument for operando analytics, data exploration, and
decision support, (c) data creation and integration into machine learning
workflows, and (d) utilization in multi-modal data assimilation approaches.
Finally, we abstract away the complexity of the computational framework from
the end-user by exposing CyRSoXS to Python using Pybind. This eliminates I/O
requirements for large-scale parameter exploration and inverse design, and
democratizes usage by enabling seamless integration with a Python ecosystem

  via deep reinforcement learning and an enhanced Kalman filter","40 pages, 20 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Experimental data is costly to obtain, which makes it difficult to calibrate
complex models. For many models an experimental design that produces the best
calibration given a limited experimental budget is not obvious. This paper
introduces a deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for design of
experiments that maximizes the information gain measured by Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence obtained via the Kalman filter (KF). This combination enables
experimental design for rapid online experiments where traditional methods are
too costly. We formulate possible configurations of experiments as a decision
tree and a Markov decision process (MDP), where a finite choice of actions is
available at each incremental step. Once an action is taken, a variety of
measurements are used to update the state of the experiment. This new data
leads to a Bayesian update of the parameters by the KF, which is used to
enhance the state representation. In contrast to the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency
(NSE) index, which requires additional sampling to test hypotheses for forward
predictions, the KF can lower the cost of experiments by directly estimating
the values of new data acquired through additional actions. In this work our
applications focus on mechanical testing of materials. Numerical experiments
with complex, history-dependent models are used to verify the implementation
and benchmark the performance of the RL-designed experiments.

next time in the 3D Euclidean space, which possesses the capacity to infer
autonomously the non-rigid motion of all objects in the scene. The previous
methods for estimating scene flow from images have limitations, which split the
holistic nature of 3D scene flow by estimating optical flow and disparity
separately. Learning 3D scene flow from point clouds also faces the
difficulties of the gap between synthesized and real data and the sparsity of
LiDAR point clouds. In this paper, the generated dense depth map is utilized to
obtain explicit 3D coordinates, which achieves direct learning of 3D scene flow
from 2D images. The stability of the predicted scene flow is improved by
introducing the dense nature of 2D pixels into the 3D space. Outliers in the
generated 3D point cloud are removed by statistical methods to weaken the
impact of noisy points on the 3D scene flow estimation task. Disparity
consistency loss is proposed to achieve more effective unsupervised learning of
3D scene flow. The proposed method of self-supervised learning of 3D scene flow
on real-world images is compared with a variety of methods for learning on the
synthesized dataset and learning on LiDAR point clouds. The comparisons of
multiple scene flow metrics are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of introducing pseudo-LiDAR point cloud to scene flow estimation.

application challenge for traditional reinforcement learning. Offline
reinforcement learning uses previously-collected datasets to train agents
without any interaction. For addressing the overestimation of OOD
(out-of-distribution) actions, conservative estimates give a low value for all
inputs. Previous conservative estimation methods are usually difficult to avoid
the impact of OOD actions on Q-value estimates. In addition, these algorithms
usually need to lose some computational efficiency to achieve the purpose of
conservative estimation. In this paper, we propose a simple conservative
estimation method, double conservative estimates (DCE), which use two
conservative estimation method to constraint policy. Our algorithm introduces
V-function to avoid the error of in-distribution action while implicit
achieving conservative estimation. In addition, our algorithm uses a
controllable penalty term changing the degree of conservatism in training. We
theoretically show how this method influences the estimation of OOD actions and
in-distribution actions. Our experiment separately shows that two conservative
estimation methods impact the estimation of all state-action. DCE demonstrates
the state-of-the-art performance on D4RL.

directly sharing the private user interaction data with organizations or
releasing them to the public. To address this problem, in this paper, we
present a User Privacy Controllable Synthetic Data Generation model (short for

privacy preferences. The generation model aims to provide certain privacy
guarantees while maximizing the utility of the generated synthetic data at both
data level and item level. Specifically, at the data level, we design a
selection module that selects those items that contribute less to a user's
preferences from the user's interaction data. At the item level, a synthetic
data generation module is proposed to generate a synthetic item corresponding
to the selected item based on the user's preferences. Furthermore, we also
present a privacy-utility trade-off strategy to balance the privacy and utility
of the synthetic data. Extensive experiments and ablation studies have been
conducted on three publicly accessible datasets to justify our method,
demonstrating its effectiveness in generating synthetic data under users'

supporting the guardrail. Since images were used in this process collected from
an actual job site, several false detections were identified. Therefore,
additional constraints were introduced in the following steps to filter out
false detections. Second, the research team applied a horizontal line detector
to the image to properly detect floors and remove the detections that were not
close to the floors. Finally, since the guardrail posts are installed with
approximately normal distribution between each post, the space between them was
estimated and used to find the most likely distance between the two posts. The
research team used various combinations of the developed approaches to monitor
guardrail systems in the captured images from a high-rise building project.
Comparing the precision and recall metrics indicated that the cascade

utilize the received signals corresponding to the far-field wide beams to

the proposed original and the improved neural networks. The original scheme
estimates the optimal near-field codeword directly based on the output of the

Finally, the simulation results show that our proposed schemes can
significantly reduce the training overhead in the near-field domain and achieve

cut the space into several blocks and progressively train each block with the

particle-in-cell simulation code. Assuming a stellar-mass BH, we find that the
created pairs fail to screen the electric field along the magnetic field,
provided that the mass accretion rate is much small compared to the Eddington
limit. Magnetic islands are created by reconnection near the equator and
migrate toward the event horizon, expelling magnetic flux tubes from the BH
vicinity during a large fraction of time. When the magnetic islands stick to
the horizon due to redshift and virtually vanish, a strong magnetic field
penetrates the horizon, enabling efficient extraction of energy from the BH.
During this flaring phase, a BH gap appears around the inner light surface with
a strong meridional return current toward the equator within the ergosphere. If
the mass accretion rate is 0.025 percent of the Eddington limit, the BH's
spin-down luminosity becomes 16-19 times greater than its analytical estimate
during the flares, although its long-term average is only 6 percent of it. We
demonstrate that the extracted energy flux concentrates along the magnetic
field lines threading the horizon in the middle latitudes. It is implied that
this meridional concentration of the Poynting flux may result in the formation
of limb-brightened jets from low-accreting BH systems.

the FDIE from a graph signal processing perspective. Finally, motivated by this
perspective, we further propose a graph induced embedding and its inverse,
which include the previously introduced embeddings as special cases. This
deepens the understanding of input design from a new viewpoint beyond the real

accelerating the particles up to EeV energies. Recent IceCube detection of
astrophysical neutrino emission in coincidence with the enhanced gamma-ray from

for acrylic and 0.04 mm for copper. For the anthropomorphic phantom, direct MD
resulted in incorrect interpretation of contrast and soft tissue, while SSQI
successfully distinguished them and reduced RMSE in material-specific images by
38% to 92%. For the flow phantom, SSQI was able to perform accurate dynamic
quantitative imaging, separating contrast from the background.
  Conclusions: We demonstrated the potential of SSQI for robust quantitative
x-ray imaging. The simplicity of SSQI may enable its widespread adoption,
including radiography and dynamic imaging such as real-time image guidance and
cone-beam CT.

cameras based on sCMOS sensors. Two cameras, CNX22 and CNX 66, have been
developed using sCMOS sensors with a photosensitive area of 2 cm * 2 cm and 6
cm * 6 cm, respectively. The designs of the cameras are presented in this
paper. The CNX22 camera has a frame rate of 48 fps, whereas CNX66 has a frame
rate of currently 20 fps, that can be boosted to 100 fps in the future. The
operating temperature of the sCMOS sensor can reach to -20C for CNX22 and -30C
for CNX66 with a peltier cooler device. In addition to the commonly used mode
of saving original images, the cameras provide a mode of real-time extraction
of X-ray events and storage their information, which significantly reduces the
requirement for data storage and offline analysis work. For both cameras, the
energy resolutions can reach less than 200 eV at 5.9 keV using single-pixel
events. These cameras are suitable for X-ray spectroscopy applications in
laboratories and calibration for the space X-ray telescopes.

effects from unwanted environmental noise. Since actual realizations or states
of the noise are typically unknown, the usual treatment for the quantum
system's dynamics is via the Lindblad master equation, which in essence
describes an average evolution (mean path) of the system's state affected by
the unknown noise. We here consider an alternative view of a noise-affected
open quantum system, where the average dynamics can be unravelled into
hypothetical noisy quantum trajectories, and propose a new optimal control
strategy for the state-preparation problem based on the likelihood of noise
occurrence. We adopt the most-likely path technique for quantum
state-preparation, constructing a stochastic path integral for noise variables
and finding control functions associated with the most-likely noise to achieve
target states. As a proof of concept, we apply the method to a qubit-state
preparation under a dephasing noise and analytically solve for controlled Rabi
drives for arbitrary target states. Since the method is constructed based on
the probability of noise, we also introduce a fidelity success rate as a new
measure of the state preparation and benchmark our most-likely path controls
against the existing mean-path approaches.

electrochemical dissolution at internal defects, i.e., grain boundaries and
dislocations. We showcase the feasibility of this approach by stabilizing a
model Pt catalyst with an addition of more noble Au (approximately 5 atomic
percent). We characterized the defects' nanoscale structure and chemistry, and
monitored the electrochemical dissolution of Pt and PtAu alloys by online
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Once segregated to defects, Au
atoms can stabilize and hence passivate the most vulnerable sites against
electrochemical dissolution and improve the stability and longevity of the Pt
electrocatalysts by more than an order of magnitude. This opens pathways to use
solute segregation to defects for the development of more stable nanoscale
electrocatalysts, a concept applicable for a wide range of catalytic systems.

graph-generating problem by many existing approaches. Specifically, these
methods firstly identify the reaction center, and break target molecule
accordingly to generate synthons. Reactants are generated by either adding
atoms sequentially to synthon graphs or directly adding proper leaving groups.
However, both two strategies suffer since adding atoms results in a long
prediction sequence which increases generation difficulty, while adding leaving
groups can only consider the ones in the training set which results in poor
generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end graph generation
model for retrosynthesis prediction, which sequentially identifies the reaction
center, generates the synthons, and adds motifs to the synthons to generate
reactants. Since chemically meaningful motifs are bigger than atoms and smaller
than leaving groups, our method enjoys lower prediction complexity than adding

and communication systems, require high sampling rates and therefore expensive
and energy-hungry analogto-digital converters (ADCs). In applications where
cost and power constraints exist, the use of high-precision ADCs is not
feasible and the designer must resort to ADCs with coarse quantization.
Consequently the interest in the topic of signal parameter estimation from
quantized data has increased significantly in recent years. The Cramer-Rao
bound (CRB) is an important yardstick in any parameter estimation problem.
Indeed it lower bounds the variance of any unbiased parameter estimator.
Moreover, the CRB is an achievable limit, for instance it is asymptotically
attained by the maximum likelihood estimator (under regularity conditions), and
thus it is a useful benchmark to which the accuracy of any parameter estimator
can and should be compared. A formula for the CRB for signal parameter
estimation from real-valued quantized data has been presented in but its
derivation was somewhat sketchy. The said CRB formula has been extended for
instance in to complex-valued quantized data, but again its derivation was
rather sketchy. The special case of binary (1-bit) ADCs and a signal consisting
of one sinusoid has been thoroughly analyzed in . The CRB formula for a binary
ADC and a general real-valued signal has been derived.

nocturnal inversion layer. However, ground surface, owing to its higher thermal
inertia, lags in the cooling process. Due to this about a meter thick air layer
just above the ground can be (2-6)deg Celsius cooler than the ground. Thus, at
the surface an unstable convective layer is present, which is capped by a
stable inversion layer that extends up to several hundred meters. This
configuration involving a convective mixed layer topped by a stably stratified

Micrometeorological phenomenon at the surface, such as occurrence of fog, is

actions that can smoothly blend historical and future actions. Specifically,
MARIONET first encodes target action tag and contextual information into an
action-level latent code. The code is unfolded into frame-level control signals
via a time unrolling module, which could be then combined with other
frame-level control signals like the target trajectory. Motion frames are then
generated in an auto-regressive way. By sequentially applying MARIONET, the
system NEURAL MARIONETTE can robustly generate long-term, multi-action motions
with the help of two simple schemes, namely ""Shadow Start"" and ""Action
Revision"". Along with the novel system, we also present a new dataset dedicated
to the multi-action motion synthesis task, which contains both action tags and
their contextual information. Extensive experiments are conducted to study the
action accuracy, naturalism, and transition smoothness of the motions generated
by our system.

the method realizes automatically selecting stable blocks which can avoid being

human's insensitivity to some specific color components, a channel-referenced

Moreover, compared with other methods' embedding watermark only at low

the video encoding process. Experimental results show that the proposed method
achieves excellent video quality and high robustness against geometric attacks,

timbre replacement. Although most VAE-based MISS methods seek a disentangled

timbre remains an open problem. To address this problem, we focus on the fact
that musical instruments can be hierarchically classified on the basis of their
physical mechanisms. Motivated by this hierarchy, we propose a VAE-based MISS
method by introducing a hyperbolic space for timbre. The hyperbolic space can
represent treelike data more efficiently than the Euclidean space owing to its
exponential growth property. Results of experiments show that the proposed

strongly correlated systems. Despite many efforts, previous studies have not
revealed all of the guiding principles for the FCI search. In this paper, we
investigate a relationship between the topological band structure in the
two-particle problem and the FCI ground states in the many-body problem. We
first formulate the two-particle problem of a bosonic on-site interaction
projected onto the lowest band of a given tight-binding Hamiltonian. We
introduce a reduced Hamiltonian whose eigenvalues correspond to the
two-particle bound-state energies. By using the reduced Hamiltonian, we define
the two-particle Chern number and numerically check the bulk-boundary
correspondence that is predicted by the two-particle Chern number. We then
propose that a nontrivial two-particle Chern number of dominant bands roughly
indicates the presence of bosonic FCI ground states at filling factor
$\nu=1/2$. We numerically investigate this relationship in several
tight-binding models with Chern bands and find that it holds well in most of
the cases, albeit two-band models being exceptions. Although the two-particle
topology is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the FCI state as
other indicators in previous studies, our numerical results indicate that the
two-particle topology characterizes the degree of similarity to the FQH
systems.

effect in III-V hot-carrier solar cells with a quantum well absorber. The
question underlying the proposed investigation is: what is the power required
to maintain two populations of electron and hole carriers in a
quasi-equilibrium state at fixed temperatures and quasi-Fermi level splitting?
The obtained answer is that the thermalization power density is reduced in
two-dimensional systems compared to their bulk counterpart, which demonstrates
a confinement-induced enhancement of the hot carrier effect in quantum wells.
This power overall increases with the well thickness, and it is moreover shown
that the intra-subband contribution dominates at small thicknesses while the
inter-subband contribution increases with thickness and dominates in the bulk
limit. Finally, the effects of the thermodynamic state of phonons and screening
are clarified. In particular, the two-dimensional thermalization power density
exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the thickness of the quantum well layer,
when both out-of-equilibrium longitudinal optical phonons and screening effects
are taken into account. Our theoretical and numerical results provide tracks to
interpret intriguing experimental observations in quantum well physics. They

capabilities, low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations can independently
build inter-satellite networks without relying on traditional ground stations
restricted by geographical distribution and can establish inter-satellite links
(ISLs) and complete computing and routing on-board. The characteristics of
frequent on-off ISLs, the highly dynamic network topology of satellite networks
make it face the challenges of routing strategy design as a delay/interruption
tolerant network (DTN). As a deterministic dynamic routing algorithm, contact
graph routing (CGR) uses a contact plan to calculate the path and forward data,
but it still has problems such as high computational overhead, low prediction
accuracy caused by ignoring queue delay, and overbooked problem caused by
limited cache. Therefore, we first start with the time-space resource contact
graph (TSRCG) to accurately characterize the time-varying and predictable
characteristics of the satellite network and the network resource parameters
under multi-tasks. Then, we optimize the route-list computation and dynamic
route computation process to ensure task delivery and reduce the consumption of
various resources, such as contact capacity, computing resources, and storage
resources. And the resource optimization for the multi-task delivery guarantee
algorithm based on CGR (RMDG-CGR) strategy we propose is compared with standard
CGR in ION 4.0.1. Finally, the simulation results show that the RMDG-CGR can
achieve higher task delivery in advance and successful task delivery rate, save
contact volume occupancy rate, computing and storage resource, and the above
effects are more prominent, especially in the task scenario with critical
bundles.

out that the star HD 60855 has passed through a disc-less episode in 2008, with

image classification using small training data. Neural network-based deep
learning methods are effective for image classification, but they typically
require large-scale training data and have major limitations such as requiring
expertise to design network architectures and having poor interpretability.
Evolutionary deep learning is a recent hot topic that combines evolutionary
computation with deep learning. However, most evolutionary deep learning
methods focus on evolving architectures of neural networks, which still suffer
from limitations such as poor interpretability. To address this, this paper
proposes a new genetic programming-based evolutionary deep learning approach to
data-efficient image classification. The new approach can automatically evolve
variable-length models using many important operators from both image and
classification domains. It can learn different types of image features from
colour or gray-scale images, and construct effective and diverse ensembles for
image classification. A flexible multi-layer representation enables the new
approach to automatically construct shallow or deep models/trees for different
tasks and perform effective transformations on the input data via multiple
internal nodes. The new approach is applied to solve five image classification
tasks with different training set sizes. The results show that it achieves
better performance in most cases than deep learning methods for data-efficient
image classification. A deep analysis shows that the new approach has good
convergence and evolves models with high interpretability, different
lengths/sizes/shapes, and good transferability.

active area of research, as the current implementation of the DTN core protocol
still relies on the assumption that there is always enough memory available in
different network nodes to store and forward bundles. In addition, the
classical queuing theory does not apply to the dynamic management of DTN node
buffers. Therefore, this paper proposes a centralized approach to automatically
manage cognitive DTN nodes in low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation
scenarios based on the advanced reinforcement learning (RL) strategy advantage
actor-critic (A2C). The method aims to explore training a geosynchronous earth
orbit intelligent agent to manage all DTN nodes in an LEO satellite
constellation scenario. The goal of the A2C agent is to maximize delivery
success rate and minimize network resource consumption cost while considering
node memory utilization. The intelligent agent can dynamically adjust the radio
data rate and perform drop operations based on bundle priority. In order to
measure the effectiveness of applying A2C technology to DTN node management
issues in LEO satellite constellation scenarios, this paper compares the
trained intelligent agent strategy with the other two non-RL policies,
including random and standard policies. Experiments show that the A2C strategy
balances delivery success rate and cost, and provides the highest reward and
the lowest node memory utilization.

and, together with complementary theoretical and laboratory results, to
understand their surfaces' micro and macroscopic properties. Although we can
observe asteroids up to phase angles of about 30 deg, the range of phase angles
covered by outer solar system objects usually does not go further than 7 to 10
deg for centaurs and 2 deg for trans-Neptunian objects, and a linear relation
between magnitude and phase angle may be assumed.
  Aims: We aim at directly comparing data taken for objects in the inner solar
system (inside the orbit of Jupiter) with data of centaurs and trans-Neptunian
objects.
  Methods: We use the SLOAN Moving Objects Catalog data to construct phase
curves restricted to phase angles less than or equal to 7.5 deg, compatible
with the angles observed for the trans-Neptunian/Centaur population. We assume
a linear model for the photometric behavior to obtain absolute magnitudes and
phase coefficients in the ugirz, V, and R filters.
  Results: We obtained absolute magnitudes in seven filters for $>4000$
objects. Our comparison with outer solar system objects points to a common
property of the surfaces: intrinsically redder objects become blue with
increasing phase angle, while the opposite happens for intrinsically bluer
objects.

SNe can be used to constrain numerous properties of their ejecta, without the
need for expensive spectroscopic observations. Using radiative-transfer
simulations for explosions of He-star progenitors of different initial masses,
we show that the g-band filter follows primarily the strength of the FeII

information on nucleosynthetic yields. Information on weaker lines, which may
be used, for example, to constrain clumping, is absent. However, this
deficiency may eventually be cured by improving the physical realism of
radiative-transfer simulations through a closer connection to physically
consistent 3D explosion models, and by the judicial selection of a much smaller
set of spectral observations. Degeneracies inherent to the SN radiation will
affect the interpretation of photometric measures, but line fluxes from
nebular-phase spectra are similarly compromised. Importantly, our ``family'' of
Type Ibc SN models follows a distinct trajectory in color-color magnitude
diagrams as the ejecta evolve from 100 to 450d, allowing one to disentangle
different progenitors or explosions. This photometric procedure provides a
promising approach to study statistical samples of SNe Ibc and to confront them

that an $r$-graph obtained by removing an edge from a $\lambda$-perfect

exploration of the design space of interactive wrapped visualisations,
characterising the visualisations that help people understand the relationship

that these interactive visualisations better preserve the spatial relations in

this issue, we introduce RIGA to learn descriptors that are Rotation-Invariant
by design and Globally-Aware. From the Point Pair Features (PPFs) of sparse
local regions, rotation-invariant local geometry is encoded into geometric
descriptors. Global awareness of 3D structures and geometric context is
subsequently incorporated, both in a rotation-invariant fashion. More
specifically, 3D structures of the whole frame are first represented by our
global PPF signatures, from which structural descriptors are learned to help
geometric descriptors sense the 3D world beyond local regions. Geometric
context from the whole scene is then globally aggregated into descriptors.
Finally, the description of sparse regions is interpolated to dense point
descriptors, from which correspondences are extracted for registration. To
validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on both object- and
scene-level data. With large rotations, RIGA surpasses the state-of-the-art
methods by a margin of 8\degree in terms of the Relative Rotation Error on

demonstrate an approach which is able to overcome these limitations using

simulate a variety views and conditions (including noise and blurring) which
may only occur sporadically in real-world data and make it difficult for
machine learning algorithm to 'cope' with these unforeseen problems in
real-data. This approach enables us to rapidly train and prepare a robust

parallelism. Given the model description and the device information, OSDP makes
trade-offs between the memory consumption and the hardware utilization, thus
automatically generates the distributed computation graph and maximizes the
overall system throughput. In addition, OSDP introduces operator splitting to
further alleviate peak memory footprints during training with negligible
overheads, which enables the trainability of larger models as well as the
higher throughput. Extensive experimental results of OSDP on multiple different

Gauss-Markov process, which is widely adopted to model temporal dynamics of

which can serve as objective functions for system optimization. Based on the
theoretical results, we formulate a computation offloading optimization problem
at edge tier, where the timeliness of status updates is minimized among
multiple devices by joint optimization of task generation, bandwidth

been extensively studied for AUPRC optimization, the generalization is only
guaranteed in the multi-query case. In this work, we present the first trial in
the single-query generalization of stochastic AUPRC optimization. For sharper
generalization bounds, we focus on algorithm-dependent generalization. There
are both algorithmic and theoretical obstacles to our destination. From an
algorithmic perspective, we notice that the majority of existing stochastic
estimators are biased only when the sampling strategy is biased, and is
leave-one-out unstable due to the non-decomposability. To address these issues,
we propose a sampling-rate-invariant unbiased stochastic estimator with
superior stability. On top of this, the AUPRC optimization is formulated as a
composition optimization problem, and a stochastic algorithm is proposed to
solve this problem. From a theoretical perspective, standard techniques of the
algorithm-dependent generalization analysis cannot be directly applied to such
a listwise compositional optimization problem. To fill this gap, we extend the
model stability from instancewise losses to listwise losses and bridge the
corresponding generalization and stability. Additionally, we construct state
transition matrices to describe the recurrence of the stability, and simplify
calculations by matrix spectrum. Practically, experimental results on three

Partial relay selection based on outdated channel state information (CSI) is

Amplify-and-forward relaying protocol is utilized. The RF links are assumed to
be subject to Rayleigh fading, and the FSO links are influenced by both
Gamma-Gamma atmospheric turbulence and pointing errors. On the basis of our
previously derived expression for cumulative distribution function of the

The results illustrate that the temporal correlation between outdated and

  with Limited Angular Density",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper presents a new method for reconstructing regions of interest (ROI)
from a limited number of computed tomography (CT) measurements. Classical
model-based iterative reconstruction methods lead to images with predictable
features. Still, they often suffer from tedious parameterization and slow
convergence. On the contrary, deep learning methods are fast, and they can
reach high reconstruction quality by leveraging information from large
datasets, but they lack interpretability. At the crossroads of both methods,
deep unfolding networks have been recently proposed. Their design includes the
physics of the imaging system and the steps of an iterative optimization
algorithm. Motivated by the success of these networks for various applications,
we introduce an unfolding neural network called U-RDBFB designed for ROI CT
reconstruction from limited data. Few-view truncated data are effectively
handled thanks to a robust non-convex data fidelity term combined with a
sparsity-inducing regularization function. We unfold the Dual Block coordinate
Forward-Backward (DBFB) algorithm, embedded in an iterative reweighted scheme,
allowing the learning of key parameters in a supervised manner. Our experiments
show an improvement over several state-of-the-art methods, including a
model-based iterative scheme, a multi-scale deep learning architecture, and
other deep unfolding methods.

prospective contender for application in renewable energy harvesting by solar
thermochemical hydrogen generation. Using solar energy, oxygen-vacancies can be
created in BCM and the reduced crystal so obtained can, in turn, produce H2 by
stripping oxygen from H2O. Therefore, a first step toward understanding the
working mechanism and optimizing the performance of BCM, is a thorough and
comparative analysis of the electronic structure of the pristine and the
reduced material. In this paper, we probe the electronic structure of BCM using
the combined effort of first-principles calculations and experimental O K-edge
x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The computed projected density-of-states
(PDOS) and orbital-plots are used to propose a simplified model for
orbital-mixing between the oxygen and the ligand atoms. With the help of
state-of-the-art simulations, we are able to find the origins of the XAS peaks
and to categorize them on the basis of contribution from Ce and Mn. For the
reduced crystal, the calculations show that, as a consequence of dielectric
screening, the change in electron-density resulting from the reduction is
strongly localized around the oxygen vacancy. Our experimental studies reveal a
marked lowering of the first O K-edge peak in the reduced crystal which is
shown to result from a diminished O-2p contribution to the frontier unoccupied
orbitals, in accordance with the tight-binding scheme. Our study paves the way
for investigation of the working-mechanism of BCM and for computational and

non-convex optimization. At each iteration, CR solves a cubically regularized
quadratic problem, called the cubic regularization subproblem (CRS). One way to
solve the CRS relies on solving the secular equation, whose computational
bottleneck lies in the computation of all eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. In
this paper, we propose and analyze a novel CRS solver based on an approximate
secular equation, which requires only some of the Hessian eigenvalues and is
therefore much more efficient. Two approximate secular equations (ASEs) are
developed. For both ASEs, we first study the existence and uniqueness of their
roots and then establish an upper bound on the gap between the root and that of
the standard secular equation. Such an upper bound can in turn be used to bound
the distance from the approximate CRS solution based ASEs to the true CRS
solution, thus offering a theoretical guarantee for our CRS solver. A desirable
feature of our CRS solver is that it requires only matrix-vector multiplication
but not matrix inversion, which makes it particularly suitable for
high-dimensional applications of unconstrained non-convex optimization, such as
low-rank recovery and deep learning. Numerical experiments with synthetic and
real data-sets are conducted to investigate the practical performance of the
proposed CRS solver. Experimental results show that the proposed solver

increments in deformation and time. Neural networks and the consequent
constitutive models depend, thus, on the particular incremental formulation,
fail in identifying material representations locally in time, and suffer from
poor generalization. Herein, we propose a new approach which allows, for the
first time, to decouple the material representation from the incremental

(TANN) and the theory of the internal variables, the evolution TANN (eTANN) are
continuous-time and, therefore, independent of the aforementioned artificial

evolution equations of the internal variables in the form of ordinary

this work, we focus attention to juxtapose and show how the various general
notions of solid mechanics are implemented in eTANN. The capabilities as well
as the scalability of the proposed approach are demonstrated through several
applications involving a broad spectrum of complex material behaviors, from
plasticity to damage and viscosity (and combination of them). Finally, we show
that the proposed approach can be used to speed-up multiscale analyses, by

describe the average macroscopic material behavior, but also micromechanical,

well as fully resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the unsteady
Navier-Stokes equations. Both models resolve the time-dependent bath and
droplet shapes in addition to the droplet trajectory. In the quasi-potential
model, the droplet and bath shape are decomposed using orthogonal function
decompositions leading to two sets of coupled damped linear harmonic oscillator
equations solved using an implicit numerical method. The underdamped dynamics
of the drop are directly coupled to the response of the bath through a
single-point kinematic match condition which we demonstrate to be an effective

to address such asymmetric nature, multilingual neural machine translation

translation. Our model comprises of two MNMT systems i.e. for English-Indic
(one-to-many) and the other for Indic-English (many-to-one) with a shared
encoder-decoder containing 15 language pairs (30 translation directions). Since
most of IL pairs have scanty amount of parallel corpora, not sufficient for

of high-resource languages of the same family in boosting the performance of
low-resource languages. Moreover, the experimental results also show the
advantage of backtranslation and domain adaptation for ILs to enhance the

advantage of the existing optical flow methods that are highly robust to the
variations in the illumination. Specifically, using the bidirectional flows
estimated using an existing pre-trained flow network, we predict the flows from
an intermediate frame to the two input images. To do this, we propose to encode
the bidirectional flows into a coordinate-based network, powered by a
hypernetwork, to obtain a continuous representation of the flow across time.
Once we obtain the estimated flows, we use them within an existing blending
network to obtain the final intermediate frame. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that our approach is able to produce significantly better
results than state-of-the-art frame interpolation algorithms.

Further, we evaluate existing malware detection techniques for deployment in

  We find that repository administrators have exacting technical demands for

of even 0.01% to be unacceptably high, given the large number of package
releases that might trigger false alerts. Measured tools have false positive
rates between 15% and 97%; increasing thresholds for detection rules to reduce
this rate renders the true positive rate useless. In some cases, these checks
emitted alerts more often for benign packages than malicious ones. However, we

2D (Graphene and h-BN) passive scatterers, ~25 times improvement in gain volume
is observed for the disordered system consisting of RhB and 2D-YP, i.e.,
2D-YP@RhB, which is found to be due to the formation of a large refractive
index gradient, as induced by the thermal nonlinear optical (NLO) interaction.
Hence, incoherent RL (ic-RL) emission ~591 nm is reported for 2D-YP@RhB at a
lowest threshold input pump power and a linewidth of 65 mW and 3 nm,

obtaining estimates of the jet magnetic field strength. The VLBI core is
typically identified as the bright feature at the jet's base, and the position
of the core changes with the observed frequency, $r_\mathrm{core} \propto
\nu^{-1/k_r}$. In this work, we investigated the time variability of the
core-shift effect in the blazar 3C 454.3. We employed self-referencing analysis
of multi-frequency (5, 8, 15, 22-24, and 43 GHz) VLBA data covering 19 epochs
from 2005 until 2010. We found significant core shift variability ranging from
0.27 to 0.86 mas between 5 and 43 GHz, confirming the core-shift variability
phenomenon observed before. Time variability of the core-shift index ($k_r$)
was found typically below one, with an average value of $0.85 \pm 0.08$ and a
standard deviation of $0.30$. $k_r<1$ values were found during flaring and
quiescent states and our results indicate that commonly assumed conical jet
shape and equipartition conditions do not always hold simultaneously. Still,
these conditions are often assumed when deriving magnetic field strengths from
core shift measurements, leading to unreliable results if $k_r$ significantly
deviates from unity. Therefore, it is important to verify that $k_r = 1$ holds
before using core shift values and the equipartition assumption to derive
physical parameters in the jets. When $k_r = 1$ epochs are selected in the case
of 3C 454.3, the magnetic field estimates are indeed quite consistent, even
though the core shift varies with time. Additionally, our estimations of the
jet's magnetic flux in 3C 454.3 show that the source is indeed in the

Rosette Nebula, centred at the young cluster NGC 2244, with the aim of
constructing the most reliable candidate member list to date, determining
various structural and kinematic parameters, and learning about the past and
the future of the region. Starting from a catalogue containing optical to
mid-infrared photometry, as well as positions and proper motions from Gaia
EDR3, we apply the Probabilistic Random Forest algorithm and derive membership
probability for each source. Based on the list of almost 3000 probable members,
of which about a third are concentrated within the radius of 20' from the
centre of NGC 2244, we identify various clustered sources and stellar
concentrations, and estimate the average distance of 1489+-37 pc (entire
region), 1440+-32 pc (NGC 2244) and 1525+-36 pc (NGC 2237). The masses,
extinction, and ages are derived by SED fitting, and the internal dynamic is
assessed via proper motions relative to the mean proper motion of NGC 2244. NGC
2244 is showing a clear expansion pattern, with an expansion velocity that
increases with radius. Its IMF is well represented by two power laws
(dN/dM\propto M^{-\alpha}), with slopes \alpha = 1.05+-0.02 for the mass range
0.2 - 1.5 MSun, and \alpha = 2.3+-0.3 for the mass range 1.5 - 20 MSun, in
agreement with other star forming regions. The mean age of the region is ~2
Myr. We find evidence for the difference in ages between NGC 2244 and the
region associated with the molecular cloud, which appears slightly younger. The
velocity dispersion of NGC 2244 is well above the virial velocity dispersion
derived from the total mass (1000+-70 MSun) and half-mass radius (3.4+-0.2 pc).
From the comparison to other clusters and to numerical simulations, we conclude
that NGC 2244 may be unbound, and possibly even formed in a super-virial state.

primitive, with applications ranging from notifications to asynchronous payment
systems. Motivated by practical consideration, we study Client-Server Byzantine
Reliable Broadcast (CSB), a multi-shot variant of BRB whose interface is split
between broadcasting clients and delivering servers. We present Draft, an
optimally resilient implementation of CSB. Like most implementations of BRB,
Draft guarantees both liveness and safety in an asynchronous environment. Under
good conditions, however, Draft achieves unparalleled efficiency. In a moment
of synchrony, free from Byzantine misbehaviour, and at the limit of infinitely
many broadcasting clients, a Draft server delivers a $b$-bits payload at an
asymptotic amortized cost of $0$ signature verifications, and $\log_2(c) + b$
bits exchanged, where $c$ is the number of clients in the system. This is the
information-theoretical minimum number of bits required to convey the payload
($b$ bits, assuming it is compressed), along with an identifier for its sender
($\log_2(c)$ bits, necessary to enumerate any set of $c$ elements, and optimal
if broadcasting frequencies are uniform or unknown). These two achievements
have profound practical implications. Real-world BRB implementations are often
bottlenecked either by expensive signature verifications, or by communication
overhead. For Draft, instead, the network is the limit: a server can deliver
payloads as quickly as it would receive them from an infallible oracle.

spatio-temporal tube of a specific object depicted by a free-form textual
expression. Existing approaches mainly treat this complicated task as a
parallel frame-grounding problem and thus suffer from two types of
inconsistency drawbacks: feature alignment inconsistency and prediction
inconsistency. In this paper, we present an end-to-end one-stage framework,
termed Spatio-Temporal Consistency-Aware Transformer (STCAT), to alleviate
these issues. Specially, we introduce a novel multi-modal template as the
global objective to address this task, which explicitly constricts the
grounding region and associates the predictions among all video frames.
Moreover, to generate the above template under sufficient video-textual
perception, an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed for effective global
context modeling. Thanks to these critical designs, STCAT enjoys more
consistent cross-modal feature alignment and tube prediction without reliance
on any pre-trained object detectors. Extensive experiments show that our method
outperforms previous state-of-the-arts with clear margins on two challenging
video benchmarks (VidSTG and HC-STVG), illustrating the superiority of the
proposed framework to better understanding the association between vision and

interest due to the rapid emergence of videos on the web. Generally, a video
contains rich instance and event information and the query text only describes
a part of the information. Thus, a video can correspond to multiple different
text descriptions and queries. We call this phenomenon the ``Video-Text
Correspondence Ambiguity'' problem. Current techniques mostly concentrate on
mining local or multi-level alignment between contents of a video and text
(\textit{e.g.}, object to entity and action to verb). It is difficult for these
methods to alleviate the video-text correspondence ambiguity by describing a
video using only one single feature, which is required to be matched with
multiple different text features at the same time. To address this problem, we
propose a Text-Adaptive Multiple Visual Prototype Matching model, which
automatically captures multiple prototypes to describe a video by adaptive
aggregation of video token features. Given a query text, the similarity is
determined by the most similar prototype to find correspondence in the video,
which is termed text-adaptive matching. To learn diverse prototypes for
representing the rich information in videos, we propose a variance loss to
encourage different prototypes to attend to different contents of the video.
Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four public video retrieval
datasets.

the evolution of galaxies, a complete AGN census is required; however, finding
heavily obscured AGNs is observationally challenging. Here we use the deep and
extensive multi-wavelength data in the COSMOS field to select a complete sample
of 578 infrared (IR) quasars ($L_{\rm AGN,IR}>10^{45}\rm \: erg\: s^{-1}$) at
$z<3$, with minimal obscuration bias, using detailed UV-to-far IR spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting. We complement our SED constraints with X-ray
and radio observations to further investigate the properties of the sample.
Overall, 322 of the IR quasars are detected by Chandra and have individual
X-ray spectral constraints. From a combination of X-ray stacking and $L_{\rm
2-10\rm keV}$ - $L_{\rm 6\: \mu m}$ analyses, we show that the majority of the
X-ray faint and undetected quasars are heavily obscured (many are likely
Compton thick), highlighting the effectiveness of the mid-IR band to find
obscured AGNs. We find that 355 ($\approx$61%) IR quasars are obscured ($N_{\rm
H}>10^{22}\rm \: cm^{-2}$) and identify differences in the average properties
between the obscured and unobscured quasars: (1) obscured quasars have
star-formation rates $\approx 3$ times higher than unobscured systems for no

  Models","Accepted by NeurIPS (spotlight) 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transformer architecture has become the fundamental element of the widespread
natural language processing~(NLP) models. With the trends of large NLP models,
the increasing memory and computation costs hinder their efficient deployment
on resource-limited devices. Therefore, transformer quantization attracts wide
research interest. Recent work recognizes that structured outliers are the
critical bottleneck for quantization performance. However, their proposed
methods increase the computation overhead and still leave the outliers there.
To fundamentally address this problem, this paper delves into the inherent
inducement and importance of the outliers. We discover that $\boldsymbol
\gamma$ in LayerNorm (LN) acts as a sinful amplifier for the outliers, and the
importance of outliers varies greatly where some outliers provided by a few
tokens cover a large area but can be clipped sharply without negative impacts.
Motivated by these findings, we propose an outlier suppression framework
including two components: Gamma Migration and Token-Wise Clipping. The Gamma
Migration migrates the outlier amplifier to subsequent modules in an equivalent
transformation, contributing to a more quantization-friendly model without any
extra burden. The Token-Wise Clipping takes advantage of the large variance of
token range and designs a token-wise coarse-to-fine pipeline, obtaining a
clipping range with minimal final quantization loss in an efficient way. This
framework effectively suppresses the outliers and can be used in a
plug-and-play mode. Extensive experiments prove that our framework surpasses
the existing works and, for the first time, pushes the 6-bit post-training BERT
quantization to the full-precision (FP) level. Our code is available at

isolated in each lattice site. The low-energy excited states in this regime can
be effectively described by fermionic quasiparticles known as doublons and
holons. Developing the effective theory, we analytically calculate the time
evolution of the second-order R\'enyi entropy (RE) for a subsystem and propose
a quasiparticle picture for the time evolution of the RE based on the obtained
analytic expressions. Doublons and holons are excited by the quench as
entangled pairs that propagate with the velocity $v_{\rm pair}=6J$. The RE
reflects the population of doublon-holon pairs that span the boundary of the
subsystem. In the short-time scale [$Jt/\hbar=\mathcal{O}({1})$], the RE
exhibits the rapid oscillations with the frequency $U/\hbar$, while in the
long-time scale ($Jt/\hbar\gg 1$) the RE grows linearly in time until the pair
spreads beyond the size of the subsystem and the RE saturates to a constant. We
find that doublon-holon pairs are emitted periodically in time after the quench

growth and the saturation of the RE.

vector (0.5 0 0.5), which condenses into a 3D-CDW through a first order phase

phonon softening. However, the inelastic spectra show a small broadening of the
Einstein-type phonon mode on approaching the phase transition. Our results
point to the situation where the Fermi surface instability at the \textit{L}

is supported by the modelling of the internal structures of the planets, which
also suggests that the three outermost planets have significant water or gas
content If the existence of two super-Mercuries in the system is confirmed,
this system will be the only one known to feature two super-Mercuries, making
it an excellent testing bed for theories of super-Mercuries formation.

In this work we investigate different modes of AGN feedback and their effect on

inside galaxy groups and clusters. For this purpose, we use the cosmological
hydrodynamic simulation SIMBA to theoretically calculate the X-ray emission

wind mode of feedback from the AGN, jet and X-ray mode of feedback play
significant roles in suppressing the X-ray emission from the diffuse gas in the

signatures of AGN feedback from the high redshift objects may not be detected

accurate yet fast object detection method for RSI, named SuperYOLO, which fuses
multimodal data and performs high-resolution (HR) object detection on
multiscale objects by utilizing the assisted super resolution (SR) learning and
considering both the detection accuracy and computation cost. First, we utilize
a symmetric compact multimodal fusion (MF) to extract supplementary information
from various data for improving small object detection in RSI. Furthermore, we
design a simple and flexible SR branch to learn HR feature representations that
can discriminate small objects from vast backgrounds with low-resolution (LR)
input, thus further improving the detection accuracy. Moreover, to avoid
introducing additional computation, the SR branch is discarded in the inference
stage, and the computation of the network model is reduced due to the LR input.
Experimental results show that, on the widely used VEDAI RS dataset, SuperYOLO
achieves an accuracy of 75.09% (in terms of mAP50 ), which is more than 10%
higher than the SOTA large models, such as YOLOv5l, YOLOv5x, and RS designed

theory, which ensures the scale-invariance of a fixed-order series at each
perturbative order. Following the idea of intrinsic conformality, we suggest a
novel single-scale setting approach under the principle of maximum conformality
(PMC) with the purpose of removing the conventional renormalization
scheme-and-scale ambiguities. We call this newly suggested single-scale
procedure as the PMC$_{\infty}$-s approach, in which an overall effective
$\alpha_s$, and hence an overall effective scale is achieved by identifying the
$\{\beta_0\}$-terms at each order. Its resultant conformal series is
scale-invariant and satisfies all renormalization group requirements. The
PMC$_{\infty}$-s approach is applicable to any perturbatively calculable
observables, and its resultant perturbative series provides an accurate basis
for estimating the contribution from the unknown higher-order (UHO) terms.
Using the Higgs decays into two gluons up to five-loop QCD corrections as an
example, we show how the PMC$_{\infty}$-s works, and we obtain $\Gamma_{\rm
H}\big|_{\text{PMC}_{\infty}\text{-s}}^{\rm PAA} = 334.45^{+7.07}_{-7.03}~{\rm
KeV}$ and $\Gamma_{\rm H}\big|_{\text{PMC}_{\infty}\text{-s}}^{\rm B.A.} =
334.45^{+6.34}_{-6.29}~{\rm KeV}$. Here the errors are squared averages of
those mentioned in the body of the text. The Pad$\acute{e}$ approximation
approach (PAA) and the Bayesian approach (B.A.) have been adopted to estimate
the contributions from the UHO-terms. We also demonstrate that the
PMC$_{\infty}$-s approach is equivalent to our previously suggested
single-scale setting approach (PMCs), which also follows from the PMC but
treats the $\{\beta_i\}$-terms from different point of view. Thus a proper
using of the renormalization group equation can provide a solid way to solve
the scale-setting problem.

enabling flight. In the dipteran indirect flight mechanism, the thorax acts as
a transmission link between the flight muscles and the wings, and it is often
thought to act as an elastic modulator: improving flight motor efficiency
thorough linear or nonlinear resonance. But as peering closely into the
drivetrain of tiny insects is experimentally difficult, the nature of this
elastic modulation, and any associated resonant effects, are unclear. Here, we
present a new inverse-problem methodology to surmount this difficulty. In a
data synthesis process, we integrate experimentally-observable aerodynamic and
musculoskeletal data for the fruit fly D. melanogaster, and identify several
surprising properties of the fly's thorax. We find that fruit flies have an
energetic need for flight motor resonance: energy savings due to flight motor
elasticity can be up be to 30%. However, the elasticity of the flight muscles
themselves is sufficient - and sometimes more than sufficient - to ensure
flight motor resonance. In fruit flies, the role of the thorax as an elastic
modulator is likely to be insignificant. We discover also a fundamental link
between the fruit fly wingbeat kinematics and musculature dynamics: wingbeat
kinematics show key adaptions, including in wing elevation angle, that ensure
that wingbeat load requirements match musculature load output capability.
Together, these newly-identified properties lead to novel conceptual model of
the fruit fly's flight motor: a strongly-nonlinear structure, resonant due to
muscular elasticity, and intensely concerned with ensuring that the primary
flight muscles are operating efficiently. Our inverse-problem methodology sheds
new light on the complex behavior of these tiny flight motors, and provides
avenues for further studies in a range of other insects.

detection is the Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB) of the objects and the fusion of
multiple OBBs requires further research attention. Second, the widely used deep
learning object detectors provide a score for each detected object as an
indicator of confidence, but how to use these indicators effectively in an
ensemble method remains a problem. Trying to address these problems, this paper
proposes OBBStacking, an ensemble method that is compatible with OBBs and
combines the detection results in a learned fashion. This ensemble method helps
take 1st place in the Challenge Track \textit{Fine-grained Object Recognition
in High-Resolution Optical Images}, which was featured in \textit{2021 Gaofen
Challenge on Automated High-Resolution Earth Observation Image Interpretation}.
The experiments on DOTA dataset and FAIR1M dataset demonstrate the improved
performance of OBBStacking and the features of OBBStacking are analyzed.

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.12994",,,,"physics.med-ph q-bio.TO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The value of preclinical diffusion MRI (dMRI) is substantial. While dMRI
enables in vivo non-invasive characterization of tissue, ex vivo dMRI is
increasingly being used to probe tissue microstructure and brain connectivity.
Ex vivo dMRI has several experimental advantages including higher
signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution compared to in vivo studies, and
more advanced diffusion contrasts for improved microstructure and connectivity
characterization. Another major advantage is direct comparison with
histological data as a crucial methodological validation. However, there are a
number of considerations that must be made when performing ex vivo experiments.
The steps from tissue preparation, image acquisition and processing, and
interpretation of results are complex, with many decisions that not only differ
dramatically from in vivo imaging, but ultimately affect what questions can be
answered using the data. This work represents 'Part 2' of a series of
recommendations and considerations for preclinical dMRI, where we focus on best
practices for dMRI of ex vivo tissue. We first describe the value that ex vivo
imaging adds to the field of dMRI, followed by general considerations and
foundational knowledge that must be considered when designing experiments. We
then give guidelines for ex vivo protocols, including tissue preparation,
imaging sequences and data processing including pre-processing, model-fitting,
and tractography. Finally, we provide an online resource which lists publicly
available ex vivo dMRI datasets and dedicated software packages. In each
section, we attempt to provide guidelines and recommendations, but also
highlight areas for which no guidelines exist, and where future work should
lie. An overarching goal herein is to enhance the rigor and reproducibility of
ex vivo dMRI acquisitions and analyses, and thereby advance biomedical
knowledge.

Space missions together with the use of lighter and flexible structures

physics and its uncertainties is then necessary in order to push control design
to the limits of performance and constrains the choice of the set of sensors
and actuators. A multi-body framework, the TITOP approach, is used to build all
the elementary flexible bodies and mechanisms involved in a fine pointing
mission. This framework allows the authors to easily include all system
dynamics with an analytical dependency on varying and uncertain mechanical
parameters in a unique Linear Fractional Transformation model. This approach
opens the doors to modern robust control techniques that robustly guarantee the
expected fine pointing requirements. A novel control architecture is proposed
to reduce the microvibrations induced both by reaction wheel imbalances and
Solar Array Drive Mechanism driving signal, by letting them work during the
imaging phase. Thanks to a set of accelerometers placed at the isolated base of
the payload and in correspondence of the mirrors with the largest size in a
Space telescope (typically the primary and secondary ones), it is possible to
estimate the line-of-sight error at the payload level by hybridizing them with
the low-frequency measurements of the camera. While a classical Fast Steering
Mirror in front of the camera can compensate for a large amount of
microvibration, an innovative architecture with a set of six Proof-Mass

  Reenactment","Accepted for publication in IEEE FG 2023. Code:
  https://github.com/StelaBou/StyleMask",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In this paper we address the problem of neural face reenactment, where, given
a pair of a source and a target facial image, we need to transfer the target's
pose (defined as the head pose and its facial expressions) to the source image,
by preserving at the same time the source's identity characteristics (e.g.,
facial shape, hair style, etc), even in the challenging case where the source
and the target faces belong to different identities. In doing so, we address
some of the limitations of the state-of-the-art works, namely, a) that they
depend on paired training data (i.e., source and target faces have the same
identity), b) that they rely on labeled data during inference, and c) that they
do not preserve identity in large head pose changes. More specifically, we
propose a framework that, using unpaired randomly generated facial images,
learns to disentangle the identity characteristics of the face from its pose by
incorporating the recently introduced style space $\mathcal{S}$ of StyleGAN2, a
latent representation space that exhibits remarkable disentanglement
properties. By capitalizing on this, we learn to successfully mix a pair of
source and target style codes using supervision from a 3D model. The resulting
latent code, that is subsequently used for reenactment, consists of latent
units corresponding to the facial pose of the target only and of units
corresponding to the identity of the source only, leading to notable
improvement in the reenactment performance compared to recent state-of-the-art
methods. In comparison to state of the art, we quantitatively and qualitatively
show that the proposed method produces higher quality results even on extreme
pose variations. Finally, we report results on real images by first embedding
them on the latent space of the pretrained generator. We make the code and

becomes increasingly important with the recent progress in experimental control
on dissipative systems and their technological exploitation . A central
question in open quantum systems concerns the fate of quantum correlations, and
the possibility of controlling them by engineering the competition between the
Hamiltonian dynamics and the coupling to a bath. Such a question is challenging
from a theoretical point of view, as numerical methods faithfully accounting
for quantum correlations are either relying on exact diagonalization, limiting
drastically the sizes that can be treated; or on approximations on the range or
strength of quantum correlations, associated to the choice of a specific Ansatz
for the density matrix. In this work we propose a new method to treat open
quantum-spin lattices, based on stochastic quantum trajectories for the
solution of the open-system dynamics. Along each trajectory, the hierarchy of
equations of motion for many-point spin-spin correlators is truncated to a
given finite order, assuming that multivariate $k$-th order cumulants vanish
for $k$ exceeding a cutoff $k_c$. This allows tracking the evolution of quantum
spin-spin correlations up to order $k_c$ for all length scales. We validate
this approach in the paradigmatic case of the phase transitions of the
dissipative 2D XYZ lattice, subject to spontaneous decay. We convincingly
assess the existence of steady-state phase transitions from paramagnetic to
ferromagnetic, and back to paramagnetic, upon increasing one of the Hamiltonian
couplings; as well as their classical Ising nature. Moreover, the approach
allows us to show the presence of significant quantum correlations in the
vicinity of the dissipative critical point, and to unveil the presence of spin
squeezing, a tight lower bound to the quantum Fisher information.

argue that network pruning can be summarized as an expressive force transfer
process of weights, where the reserved weights will take on the expressive
force from the removed ones for the purpose of maintaining the performance of
original networks. In order to achieve optimal expressive force scheduling, we
propose a pruning scheme before training called Neural Network Panning which
guides expressive force transfer through multi-index and multi-process steps,
and designs a kind of panning agent based on reinforcement learning to automate
processes. Experimental results show that Panning performs better than various
available pruning before training methods.

for the evaluation of various techniques to tackle overfitting. Motivated by
the fact that overfitted neural networks tend to rather memorize noise in the

define two new metrics that can confidently distinguish between correct and

cardiac auscultation. The murmur grade, a quantitative measure of the murmur

work aims to estimate each patient's murmur grade (i.e., absent, soft, loud)
from multiple auscultation location phonocardiograms (PCGs) of a large
population of pediatric patients from a low-resource rural area. Methods: The
Mel spectrogram representation of each PCG recording is given to an ensemble of
15 convolutional residual neural networks with channel-wise attention
mechanisms to classify each PCG recording. The final murmur grade for each
patient is derived based on the proposed decision rule and considering all
estimated labels for available recordings. The proposed method is

murmur gradings are 86.3% and 81.6% in terms of the unweighted average of
sensitivities and F1-scores, respectively. The sensitivities (and F1-scores)
for absent, soft, and loud murmurs are 90.7% (93.6%), 75.8% (66.8%), and 92.3%

average of sensitivities of 80.4% and an F1-score of 75.8%. Conclusions: This
study provides a potential approach for algorithmic pre-screening in
low-resource settings with relatively high expert screening costs.
Significance: The proposed method represents a significant step beyond
detection of murmurs, providing characterization of intensity which may provide
a enhanced classification of clinical outcomes.

properties and shed light on astronomy and astrophysics. In this work, we
investigate the detection number of the TianQin observatory on EMRBs. Our
result shows that TianQin can detect tens of EMRBs events during its mission
lifetime. For those detected events, we use the Fisher information matrix to
quantify these uncertainties in the inference of their parameters. We consider
the possible network of TianQin+LISA and study how a network can improve
parameter estimation. The result shows that, for most sources, the CO mass, the
MBH mass, and the MBH spin can be determined with an accuracy of the order
$10^{-1}$ and the sky localization can be determined with an accuracy of 10
square degrees. We further explore the gravitational wave background generated
by those unsolved EMRBs and conclude that it is about $10^6$ times weaker than
TianQin's sensitivity and thus it can be ignored.

cause the multiplier to produce incorrect outputs. To ensure that they are not

this paper, we propose a novel fault detection scheme for a recent bit-parallel
polynomial basis multiplier over GF(2m), where the proposed method aims at
obtaining high fault detection performance for finite field multipliers and
meanwhile maintain low-complexity implementation which is favored in resource
constrained applications such as smart cards. The proposed method is based on
BCH error correction codes, with an area-delay efficient architecture. The
experimental results show that for 45-bit multiplier with 5-bit errors the
proposed error detection and correction architecture results in 37% and %49
reduction in critical path delay with compared to the existing method in [18].
Moreover, the area overhead for 45-bit multiplier with 5 errors is within 80%

  SciPost Proceedings",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.IM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Pierre Auger Observatory is the world's largest detector for observation
of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) (above the energy of $10^{17}$ eV).
It consists of a Fluorescence Detector (FD) and an array of particle detectors
known as the Surface Detector (SD). Observations of extensive air showers by
the Observatory can be used to probe hadronic interactions at high energy, in a
kinematic and energy region inaccessible to experiments at man-made
accelerators and to measure the muon component of the shower. Air showers
induced by different primaries have different muon contents. With increasing
mass of the primary cosmic ray particle, it is expected that the muon content
in the corresponding air showers should also increase. Recent results obtained
from the Pierre Auger Observatory and other experiments indicate that all the
shower simulations underestimate the number of muons in the showers compared to
the data. This is the so-called muon deficit. In this paper we briefly review
the muon measurements, and present in more detail recent results on
fluctuations in the muon number. These results provide new insights into the
origin of the muon deficit in air shower simulations and constrain the models
of hadronic interactions at ultrahigh energies. With the current design of the
surface detectors it is also difficult to reliably separate the contributions
of muons to the SD signal from the contributions of photons, electrons, and
positrons. Therefore, we also present a new method to extract the muon
component of the signal time traces recorded by each SD station using recurrent
neural networks. The combination of such algorithms, with the future data
collected by the upgraded Pierre Auger Observatory, will be a major step
forward, as we are likely to achieve an unprecedented resolution in mass
estimation on an event-by-event basis.

scales are particularly critical, as different, currently viable DM models make
diverse predictions on the expected abundance and density profile of DM haloes
on these scales. We investigate the ability of sub-galactic DM haloes to act as
strong lenses on background compact sources, producing gravitational lensing
events on milli-arcsecond scales (milli-lenses), for different DM models. For
each DM scenario, we explore whether a sample of $\sim$ 5000 distant sources is
sufficient to detect at least one milli-lens. We develop a semi-analytical
model to estimate the milli-lensing optical depth as a function of the source's
redshift for various DM models. We employ the Press-Schechter formalism, as
well as results from recent N-body simulations to compute the halo mass
function, taking into account the appropriate spherically averaged density
profile of haloes for each DM model. We treat the lensing system as a
point-mass lens and invoke the effective surface mass density threshold to
calculate the fraction of a halo that acts as a gravitational lens. We study
three classes of dark matter models: cold DM, warm DM, and self-interacting DM.
We find that haloes consisting of warm DM turn out to be optically thin for
strong gravitational milli-lensing (zero expected lensing events). CDM haloes
may produce lensing events depending on the steepness of the concentration-mass
relation. Self-interacting DM haloes can efficiently act as gravitational
milli-lenses only if haloes experience gravothermal collapse, resulting in
highly dense central cores.

framework of ordinary differential equations, this is very natural to try to
extend the approach to classes of functions over the reals, and not only over

for functions from the integers to the reals, but the method used in the proof,
based on the existence of a continuous function from the integers to a suitable
discrete set of reals, cannot extend to functions from the reals to the reals,
as such a function cannot exist for clear topological reasons. In this article,
we prove that this is indeed possible to provide an elegant and simple

a characterization of such functions as the smallest class of functions that
contains some basic functions, and that is closed by composition, linear length
ODEs, and a natural effective limit schema. This is obtained using an
alternative proof technique based on the construction of specific suitable
functions defined recursively, and a barycentric method. Furthermore, we also
extend previous characterizations in several directions: First, we prove that
there is no need of multiplication. We prove a normal form theorem, with a nice
side effect related to formal neural networks. Indeed, given some fixed error

morphology of prostate cancer glands. For diagnostic work-up, pathologists
first locate glands in the whole biopsy core, and -- if they detect cancer --
they assign a Gleason grade. This time-consuming process is subject to errors
and significant inter-observer variability, despite strict diagnostic criteria.
This paper proposes an automated workflow that follows pathologists'
\textit{modus operandi}, isolating and classifying multi-scale patches of
individual glands in whole slide images (WSI) of biopsy tissues using distinct
steps: (1) two fully convolutional networks segment epithelium versus stroma
and gland boundaries, respectively; (2) a classifier network separates benign
from cancer glands at high magnification; and (3) an additional classifier
predicts the grade of each cancer gland at low magnification. Altogether, this

encodes valuable information on the mechanism of color-neutralization in these
reactions. Since the $b$-quark mass is much larger than the typical hadronic
scale of $\sim$1\,GeV, the $b\bar b$ pair production is expected to be well
separated from their subsequent hadronization process. In particular, a
significantly larger fraction of $b$ baryons has been observed in proton-proton
($pp$) and proton-antiproton ($p\bar{p}$) reactions relative to that measured
in $e^+e^-$ collisions, posing a challenge to theoretical descriptions. We
propose to resolve this problem by employing a statistical hadronization
approach with a largely augmented set of $b$-hadron states beyond the currently
measured spectrum as listed by the particle data group, by using guidance from
the relativistic quark model and lattice-QCD compuations. Assuming {\it
relative} chemical equilibrium between the yields of different kinds of $b$
hadrons, their thermo-statistical densities are used as fragmentation weights
of a $b$-quarks into the various hadron species. Aided by quark model estimates
of the decay systematics of excited states, the fragmentation fractions of
weakly-decaying $b$ hadrons are computed and found to agree well with
measurements in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at the Tevatron. Employing
transverse-momentum ($p_T$) distributions of $b$-quarks from perturbative QCD
and combining thermo-statistical fragmentation weights with independent
fragmentation toward high $p_T$, we deduce the total $b\bar{b}$ cross section
based on the computed hadro-chemistry. At the same time a fair description of
the $\bar{B}_s^0/B^-$ and $\Lambda_b^0/B^-$ ratios measured in $pp$ collisions
at the LHC is obtained. Our study thus corroborates the statistical nature of
$b$-quark hadronization in hadronic collisions at collider energies.

  note: text overlap with arXiv:2204.11091",,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  On-device session-based recommendation systems have been achieving increasing
attention on account of the low energy/resource consumption and privacy
protection while providing promising recommendation performance. To fit the
powerful neural session-based recommendation models in resource-constrained
mobile devices, tensor-train decomposition and its variants have been widely
applied to reduce memory footprint by decomposing the embedding table into
smaller tensors, showing great potential in compressing recommendation models.
However, these model compression techniques significantly increase the local
inference time due to the complex process of generating index lists and a
series of tensor multiplications to form item embeddings, and the resultant
on-device recommender fails to provide real-time response and recommendation.
To improve the online recommendation efficiency, we propose to learn
compositional encoding-based compact item representations. Specifically, each
item is represented by a compositional code that consists of several codewords,
and we learn embedding vectors to represent each codeword instead of each item.
Then the composition of the codeword embedding vectors from different embedding
matrices (i.e., codebooks) forms the item embedding. Since the size of
codebooks can be extremely small, the recommender model is thus able to fit in
resource-constrained devices and meanwhile can save the codebooks for fast
local inference.Besides, to prevent the loss of model capacity caused by
compression, we propose a bidirectional self-supervised knowledge distillation
framework. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate
that compared with existing methods, the proposed on-device recommender not
only achieves an 8x inference speedup with a large compression ratio but also
shows superior recommendation performance.

contrastive loss are defined on individual spaces in those works, so many
feasible combinations of supervision are overlooked. To overcome this issue, we
propose UniCLIP, a Unified framework for Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training. UniCLIP integrates the contrastive loss of both inter-domain
pairs and intra-domain pairs into a single universal space. The discrepancies
that occur when integrating contrastive loss between different domains are
resolved by the three key components of UniCLIP: (1) augmentation-aware feature
embedding, (2) MP-NCE loss, and (3) domain dependent similarity measure.
UniCLIP outperforms previous vision-language pre-training methods on various
single- and multi-modality downstream tasks. In our experiments, we show that
each component that comprises UniCLIP contributes well to the final
performance.

derive galaxy properties, such as the $M_\text{star}$, $M_\text{dust}$, and SFR

both the young and old stellar populations.
  Ongoing star-formation activity is found in 47% of ETGs and 8% of LTGs are
quiescent. The star-forming E galaxies, together with the LBSs, constitute a
population that follows very well the SFMS of spiral galaxies. The fraction of
the luminosity originating from young stars in the star-forming ETGs is quite
substantial ($\sim$ 25%) and similar to that of the star-forming LTGs.
Investigating possible differences between star-forming and quiescent galaxies
we find that the intrinsic shape of the SED of the star-forming galaxies is, on
average, very similar for all morphological types. Concerning their structural
parameters, quiescent galaxies tend to show larger values of the S\'ersic index
and larger $R_\text{eff}$ (compared to star-forming galaxies). Finally, we find
that star-forming galaxies preferably reside in lower-density environments
compared to the quiescent ones, which exhibit a higher percentage of sources

computer vision tasks, their adoption in real-world consumer applications
broadens continuously. Given the abundance and omnipresence of smart devices,
""smart ecosystems"" are being formed where sensing happens simultaneously rather
than standalone. This is shifting the on-device inference paradigm towards
deploying centralised neural processing units (NPUs) at the edge, where
multiple devices (e.g. in smart homes or autonomous vehicles) can stream their
data for processing with dynamic rates. While this provides enhanced potential
for input batching, naive solutions can lead to subpar performance and quality
of experience, especially under spiking loads. At the same time, the deployment
of dynamic DNNs, comprising stochastic computation graphs (e.g. early-exit (EE)
models), introduces a new dimension of dynamic behaviour in such systems. In
this work, we propose a novel early-exit-aware scheduling algorithm that allows
sample preemption at run time, to account for the dynamicity introduced both by
the arrival and early-exiting processes. At the same time, we introduce two
novel dimensions to the design space of the NPU hardware architecture, namely
Fluid Batching and Stackable Processing Elements, that enable run-time
adaptability to different batch sizes and significantly improve the NPU

classifier but it should also satisfy various constraints for practical
applications. Diversity is one of the critical constraints that however remains

Fe I lines of low excitation potential. The corresponding abundance differences
between 3D non-LTE and 1D non-LTE are generally less severe but can still reach
$\pm$0.2 dex. For Fe II lines the 3D abundances range from up to 0.15 dex

from 3D LTE except for the warmest stars at the lowest metallicities. The
results were used to correct 1D LTE abundances of the Sun and Procyon (HD

an improved ionisation balance in all four stars. In the two metal-poor stars,
they remove excitation imbalances that amount to 250 K to 300 K errors in

quantum internet. Here we present a modification of the quantum PageRank
introducing arbitrary phase rotations (APR) in the underlying Szegedy's quantum
walk. We define three different APR schemes with only one phase as a degree of
freedom. We have analyzed the behavior of these algorithms in a small generic
graph, observing that a decrease of the phase reduces the standard deviation of
the instantaneous PageRank, so the nodes of the network can be distinguished
better. However, the algorithm takes more time to converge, so the phase can
not be decreased arbitrarily. With these results we choose a concrete value for
the phase to later apply the algorithm to complex scale-free graphs. In these
networks, the original quantum PageRank is able to break the degeneracy of the
residual nodes and detect secondary hubs that the classical algorithm
suppresses. Nevertheless, not all of the detected secondary hubs are real
according to the PageRank's definition. Some APR schemes can overcome this
problem, restoring the degeneration of the residual nodes and highlighting the
truly secondary hubs of the networks. Finally, we have studied the stability of
the new algorithms. The original quantum algorithm was known to be more stable
than the classical. We have found that one of our algorithms, whose PageRank
distribution resembles the classical one, has a stability similar to the
original quantum algorithm.

pronounced viscosity levels can cause a transition from a three-shock to a

provides novel evidence that supports recent observations for axisymmetric ring

that the transition from Mach reflection to regular-like reflection is
analogous to the dual-solution domain transition for planar shocks. In

physics of neutrinos, from being well understood theoretically to requiring new
physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. Indeed, the mystery of
neutrino masses implies the presence of new particles never observed before,
often called sterile neutrinos, as they would not undergo standard weak
interactions. And while neutrino oscillation measurements entered the precision
era, reaching percent-level precision, many experimental results show
significant discrepancies with the standard model, at baselines much shorter
than typical oscillation baselines, like LSND, MiniBooNE, gallium experiments,
and reactor antineutrino measurements. These short baseline anomalies could be
explained by the addition of a light sterile neutrino, with mass in the
$1-10~\text{eV}$ range, however, in strong tension with many null experimental
observations. Other explanations that rely on sterile neutrinos with masses in
the $1-500~\text{MeV}$ could resolve the tension. Here we test both classes of
models. On the one hand, we look for datasets collected at a short baseline
which can constrain heavy sterile neutrino models. We find that the minimal
model is fully constrained, but several extensions of this model could weaken
the current constraint and be tested with current and future datasets. On the
other hand, we test the presence of neutrino oscillations at short baselines,
induced by a light sterile state, with the data collected by the MicroBooNE
experiment, a liquid argon time projection chamber specifically designed to
resolve the details of each neutrino interaction. We report null results from
both analyses, further constraining the space of possible explanations for the
short baseline anomalies. If new physics lies behind the short baseline anomaly
puzzle, it is definitely not described by a simple model.

  For one thing, we find two infinite classes of locally-APN but not APN power
functions over $\gf_{2^{2m}}$ with $m$ even, i.e.,
$\mathcal{F}_1(x)=x^{j(2^m-1)}$ with $\gcd(j,2^m+1)=1$ and

only two discovered in the last eleven years. Moreover, we also prove that this
infinite class $\mathcal{F}_1$ is not only with the optimal boomerang
uniformity $2$, but also has an interesting property that its differential
uniformity is strictly greater than its boomerang uniformity. For another
thing, using the multivariate method, including the above infinite class

redundancy are both effective approaches towards efficient video recognition,
e.g., allocating the majority of computation to a task-relevant subset of
frames or the most valuable image regions of each frame. However, in most
existing works, either type of redundancy is typically modeled with another
absent. This paper explores the unified formulation of spatial-temporal dynamic
computation on top of the recently proposed AdaFocusV2 algorithm, contributing
to an improved AdaFocusV3 framework. Our method reduces the computational cost
by activating the expensive high-capacity network only on some small but
informative 3D video cubes. These cubes are cropped from the space formed by
frame height, width, and video duration, while their locations are adaptively
determined with a light-weighted policy network on a per-sample basis. At test
time, the number of the cubes corresponding to each video is dynamically
configured, i.e., video cubes are processed sequentially until a sufficiently
reliable prediction is produced. Notably, AdaFocusV3 can be effectively trained
by approximating the non-differentiable cropping operation with the
interpolation of deep features. Extensive empirical results on six benchmark
datasets (i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID, Mini-Kinetics, Something-Something V1&V2
and Diving48) demonstrate that our model is considerably more efficient than
competitive baselines.

mock-observational catalogue spanning $5R_{200}$ around 160 analogue clusters.
These analogues are matched in mass to the 16 clusters targetted by the
forthcoming WEAVE Wide-Field Cluster Survey (WWFCS). We consider the effects of
the fibre allocation algorithm on our sampling completeness and find that we
successfully allocate targets to 81.7 $\% \pm$ 1.3 of the members in the

algorithm by using a metric, $D_{\text{skel}}$, which quantifies the distance
to the filament spine. We find that the median positional offset between
reference and recovered filament networks is $D_{\text{skel}} = 0.13 \pm 0.02$

parity checks are associated to classical product codes. We deduce several
properties of product CSS codes from the properties of the component codes,
including bounds on the code distance, and show that built-in redundancies in
the parity checks result in so-called meta-checks which can be exploited to
correct syndrome read-out errors. We then specialise to the case of
single-parity-check (SPC) product codes which in the classical domain are a
common choice for constructing product codes. Logical error rate simulations of
a SPC $3$-fold product CSS code having parameters $[[512,174,8]]$ are shown
under both a maximum likelihood decoder for the erasure channel and belief

solely by leveraging few labels in the context of medical image segmentation.
Existing methods mainly focus on instance discrimination and invariant mapping.
However, they face three common pitfalls: (1) tailness: medical image data
usually follows an implicit long-tail class distribution. Blindly leveraging
all pixels in training hence can lead to the data imbalance issues, and cause
deteriorated performance; (2) consistency: it remains unclear whether a
segmentation model has learned meaningful and yet consistent anatomical
features due to the intra-class variations between different anatomical
features; and (3) diversity: the intra-slice correlations within the entire
dataset have received significantly less attention. This motivates us to seek a
principled approach for strategically making use of the dataset itself to
discover similar yet distinct samples from different anatomical views. In this
paper, we introduce a novel semi-supervised 2D medical image segmentation
framework termed Mine yOur owN Anatomy (MONA), and make three contributions.
First, prior work argues that every pixel equally matters to the model
training; we observe empirically that this alone is unlikely to define
meaningful anatomical features, mainly due to lacking the supervision signal.
We show two simple solutions towards learning invariances - through the use of
stronger data augmentations and nearest neighbors. Second, we construct a set
of objectives that encourage the model to be capable of decomposing medical
images into a collection of anatomical features in an unsupervised manner.
Lastly, we both empirically and theoretically, demonstrate the efficacy of our
MONA on three benchmark datasets with different labeled settings, achieving new
state-of-the-art under different labeled semi-supervised settings

friendly chalcogenide perovskite with promising properties for various energy
conversion applications. Recently, sulfurization of oxide precursors has been
suggested as a viable solution for effective synthesis, especially from the
perspective of circumventing the difficulty of handling alkali earth metals. In
this work, we explore in detail the synthesis of BaZrS3 from Ba-Zr-O oxide
precursor films sulfurized at temperatures ranging from 700 {\deg}C to 1000
{\deg}C. We propose a formation mechanism of BaZrS3 based on a two-step
reaction involving an intermediate amorphization step of the BaZrO3 crystalline
phase. We show how the diffusion of sulfur (S) species in the film is the
rate-limiting step of this reaction. The processing temperature plays a key
role in determining the total fraction of conversion from oxide to sulfide
phase at a constant flow rate of the sulfur-containing H2S gas used as a
reactant. Finally, we observe the formation of stoichiometric BaZrS3 (1:1:3),
even under Zr-rich precursor conditions, with the formation of ZrO2 as a
secondary phase. This marks BaZrS3 quite unique among the other types of
chalcogenides, such as chalcopyrites and kesterites, which can instead
accommodate quite a large range of non-stoichiometric compositions. This work
opens up a pathway for further optimization of the BaZrS3 synthesis process,
straightening the route towards future applications of this material.

large amount of manually annotated training data to achieve a good performance,
which could cause a degradation in performance if a deep learning model trained
on a given dataset is applied to a different dataset. This is commonly known as
the domain shift problem for circuit annotation, which stems from the possibly
large variations in distribution across different image datasets. The different
image datasets could be obtained from different devices or different layers
within a single device. To address the domain shift problem, we propose
Histogram-gated Image Translation (HGIT), an unsupervised domain adaptation
framework which transforms images from a given source dataset to the domain of
a target dataset, and utilize the transformed images for training a
segmentation network. Specifically, our HGIT performs generative adversarial
network (GAN)-based image translation and utilizes histogram statistics for
data curation. Experiments were conducted on a single labeled source dataset
adapted to three different target datasets (without labels for training) and
the segmentation performance was evaluated for each target dataset. We have
demonstrated that our method achieves the best performance compared to the
reported domain adaptation techniques, and is also reasonably close to the
fully supervised benchmark.

describe the denaturation transition of DNA. More recently, it has been
generalized in order to allow for asymmetry in the strands lengths and in the
formation of loops: the mathematical representation is based on a bivariate
renewal process, that describes the pairs of bases that bond together. In this
paper, we consider a disordered version of the model, in which the two strands
interact via a potential $\beta V(\hat\omega_i,\bar\omega_j)+h$ when the $i$-th
monomer of the first strand and the $j$-th monomer of the second strand meet.
Here, $h\in\mathbb R$ is a homogeneous pinning parameter,
$(\hat\omega_i)_{i\geq 1}$ and $(\bar\omega_j)_{j\geq 1}$ are two sequences of
i.i.d.~random variables attached to each DNA strand, $V(\cdot,\cdot)$ is an
interaction function and $\beta>0$ is the disorder intensity. Our main result
finds some condition on the underlying bivariate renewal so that, if one takes
$\beta,h\downarrow0$ at some appropriate (explicit) rate as the length of the
strands go to infinity, the partition function of the model admits a
non-trivial, i.e. disordered, scaling limit. This is known as an
\textit{intermediate disorder} regime and is linked to the question of disorder
relevance for the denaturation transition. Interestingly and surprisingly, the
rate at which one has to take $\beta\downarrow0$ depends on the interaction
function $V(\cdot,\cdot)$ and on the distribution of $(\hat\omega_i)_{i\geq
1}$, $(\bar\omega_j)_{j\geq 1}$. On the other hand, the intermediate disorder
limit of the partition function, when it exists, is universal: it is expressed
as a chaos expansion of iterated integrals against a Gaussian
process~$\mathcal{M}$, which arises as the scaling limit of the field
$(e^{\beta V(\hat\omega_i,\bar\omega_j)})_{i,j\geq 0}$ and exhibits strong
correlations on lines and columns.

spacecraft. We use 8-years of Swarm data from 2014 to 2021 and transform the
data from a time series into a 5 dimensional space consisting of latitude,
longitude, mlt, year, and day-of-the-year. We also add Kp, F10.7cm and solar
wind speed. The observations of EPBs with respect to geolocation, local time,
season and solar activity mostly agrees with existing work, whilst the link
geomagnetic activity is less clear. The prediction has an accuracy of 88% and
performs well across the EPB specific spatiotemporal scales. This proves that
the XGBoost method is able to successfully capture the climatological and daily
variability of SWARM EPBs. Capturing the daily variance has long evaded
researchers because of local and stochastic features within the ionosphere. We
take advantage of Shapley Values to explain the model and to gain insight into
the physics of EPBs. We find that as the solar wind speed increases the
probability of an EPB decreases. We also identify a spike in EPB probability

scale has better sound-speed and density profiles than the SSM with the old

and absence of unphysical contributions to the ground-state was assumed. We
question this belief by exact diagonalization of several small-system

then introduce Popov-Fedotov projection to pseudo-fermion functional
renormalization, enabling finite temperature computations with only minor
technical modifications to the method. At large and intermediate temperatures,
our results are perturbatively controlled and we confirm their accuracy in

during different phases of the pandemic. We use a computational approach to
capture the specific aspects that trigger an online community's anxiety about
the pandemic and investigate how these aspects change over time. First, we
identified nine subjects of anxiety (SOAs) in a sample of Reddit posts ($N$=86)
from r/COVID19\_support using thematic analysis. Then, we quantified Reddit
users' anxiety by training algorithms on a manually annotated sample ($N$=793)
to automatically label the SOAs in a larger chronological sample ($N$=6,535).
The nine SOAs align with items in various recently developed pandemic anxiety
measurement scales. We observed that Reddit users' concerns about health risks
remained high in the first eight months of the pandemic. These concerns
diminished dramatically despite the surge of cases occurring later. In general,
users' language disclosing the SOAs became less intense as the pandemic
progressed. However, worries about mental health and the future increased
steadily throughout the period covered in this study. People also tended to use
more intense language to describe mental health concerns than health risks or
death concerns. Our results suggest that this online group's mental health
condition does not necessarily improve despite COVID-19 gradually weakening as
a health threat due to appropriate countermeasures. Our system lays the
groundwork for population health and epidemiology scholars to examine aspects
that provoke pandemic anxiety in a timely fashion.

advertisements affect advertising value and brand awareness. With a rapid
increase in the number of social media users over the last ten years, a new
advertising domain has become available for companies. Brands that manage
social media well in their advertising strategies can quickly influence
consumer decision-making and create awareness. However, in social media
advertising, which is different from traditional advertising, creating content
should be produced and this content should be perceived in a short time by
consumers. To achieve this, it is necessary to build rapport with consumers and
to present correctly what they wish to see in advertisements by creating
awareness. In view of the increasing importance of social media advertising,
the study examines how consumer perceptions of Instagram advertisements affect
advertising value and brand awareness. This study was conducted with Generation
Y consumers on the basis of their Instagram habits, a popular social media app.
For this purpose, surveys were held with 665 participants who use Instagram.
The collected data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. According
to the analysis results, Y generations perceptions of Instagram advertisements
have both a positive and negative impact on advertising value and brand
awareness and brand associations.

veneer on Earth, the composition of late-impacting debris around lower-mass
stars is subject to variable volatile loss as a result of their hosts' extended
pre-main sequence phase. We perform simulations of late-stage planet formation
across the M-dwarf mass spectrum to derive upper limits on reducing bombardment
epochs in Hadean analog environments. We contrast the Solar System scenario
with varying initial volatile distributions due to extended primordial runaway
greenhouse phases on protoplanets and desiccation of smaller planetesimals by
internal radiogenic heating. We find a decreasing rate of late-accreting
reducing impacts with decreasing stellar mass. Young planets around stars
$\leq$ 0.4 $M_\odot$ experience no impacts of sufficient mass to generate
prebiotically relevant concentrations of reduced atmospheric compounds once
their stars have reached the main sequence. For M-dwarf planets to not exceed
Earth-like concentrations of volatiles, both planetesimals and larger
protoplanets must undergo extensive devolatilization processes and can
typically emerge from long-lived magma ocean phases with sufficient atmophile

class distribution match between the primary and auxiliary datasets. The
proposed method can achieve increased adversarial robustness on a primary
dataset by leveraging auxiliary datasets via multi-domain learning.
Specifically, data amplification on both robust and non-robust features can be
accomplished through the application of BiaMAT as demonstrated through a
theoretical and empirical analysis. Moreover, we demonstrate that while
existing methods are vulnerable to negative transfer due to the distributional
discrepancy between auxiliary and primary data, the proposed method enables
neural networks to flexibly leverage diverse image datasets for adversarial

application of a confidence-based selection strategy. The pre-trained models

King relation without including new fit parameters when we measure the isotope
shifts of many transitions. In the dual King relation, the fit coefficients
consist of the nuclear factors. Then, the fit results give us constraints to
the ratios of the isotope dependence independent of the electron wave

  of rain formation","23 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A 2016 paper by M Wilkinson in Physical Review Letters suggests that
large-deviation theory is a suitable framework for studying unexpectedly rapid
rain formation in collector-drop collision processes. Wilkinson derives
asymptotic approximation formulae for a set of exact large-deviation functions,
such as the cumulant generating function and the entropy function. The
asymptotic approach assumes a large number of water droplet collisions and is
motivated by the fact that the exact large-deviation functions are
prohibitively difficult to deal with directly. Wilkinson uses his asymptotic
formulae to obtain further results and also provides numerical work which
suggests that a certain log-density function for the collector-drop model
(which is a function of his asymptotic approximation formulae) is itself
approximated satisfactorily. However, the numerical work does not test the
accuracy of the individual asymptotic approximation formulae directly against
their exact large-deviation theory counterparts. When these direct checks are
carried out, they reveal that the asymptotic formulae are, in fact, rather
inaccurate, even for very large numbers of collisions. Their individual
inaccuracy is masked by their incorporation into log-density functions in
Wilkinson's numerical work. Their inaccuracy, as well as some assumptions
underlying their derivation, severely limit their applicability. The present
note points out that it is quite possible to develop accurate analytical (i.e.,
non-asymptotic) approximation formulae for the large-deviation theory functions
in the collector-drop model which also preserve the forms of the leading order
power terms in Wilkinson's asymptotic formulae. An analytical approximation
approach can be developed based on a Euler-Maclaurin formula. The resulting
analytical formulae are extremely accurate and valid for all relevant numbers
of collisions and time scales.

artifacts, preserve image details and structures, and balance real-time

remove independent column stripe noise. This is achieved through an iterative
deep unfolding algorithm where the estimated noise of one network iteration is
used as input to the next iteration. This progression substantially reduces the

employ classical mechanics methods (Amber and Gaff) with improved atomic point
charges, semi-empirical (PM3, and density functional tight binding), and
density functional theory (B3LYP) and conduct global optimizations and
frequency calculations in order to investigate the impact of PAH size on the
vibrational band positions. We primarily focus on the following mid-infrared
emission bands 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, 12.7, and 17.0 microns. We developed a
general Frequency Scaling Function (FSF) to shift the bands and to provide a
systematic comparison versus the three methods for each PAH. We first validate
this procedure on IR scaled spectra from the NASA Ames PAH Database, and extend
it to new large PAHs. We show that when the FSF is applied to the Amber and
Gaff IR spectra, an agreement between the normal mode peak positions with those
inferred from the B3LYP/4-31G model chemistry is achieved. As calculations
become time intensive for large sized molecules Nc > 450, this proposed
methodology has advantages. The FSF has enabled extending the investigations to
large PAHs where we clearly see the emergence of the 17.0 microns feature, and
the weakening of the 3.3 microns one. We finally investigate the trends in the
3.3 microns 17.0 microns PAH band ratio as a function of PAH size and its

central server and a number of clients that have access to private, potentially
sensitive data. Clients are able to keep their data in their local machines and
only share their locally trained model's parameters with a central server that
manages the collaborative learning process. FL has delivered promising results
in real-life scenarios, such as healthcare, energy, and finance. However, when
the number of participating clients is large, the overhead of managing the
clients slows down the learning. Thus, client selection has been introduced as
a strategy to limit the number of communicating parties at every step of the
process. Since the early na\""{i}ve random selection of clients, several client
selection methods have been proposed in the literature. Unfortunately, given
that this is an emergent field, there is a lack of a taxonomy of client
selection methods, making it hard to compare approaches. In this paper, we
propose a taxonomy of client selection in Federated Learning that enables us to
shed light on current progress in the field and identify potential areas of

radiographs are capable of producing clinically accurate, clear, and actionable
text that can advance patient care. However, such systems all succumb to the
same problem: making hallucinated references to non-existent prior reports.
Such hallucinations occur because these models are trained on datasets of
real-world patient reports that inherently refer to priors. To this end, we
propose two methods to remove references to priors in radiology reports: (1) a
GPT-3-based few-shot approach to rewrite medical reports without references to
priors; and (2) a BioBERT-based token classification approach to directly
remove words referring to priors. We use the aforementioned approaches to
modify MIMIC-CXR, a publicly available dataset of chest X-rays and their
associated free-text radiology reports; we then retrain CXR-RePaiR, a radiology
report generation system, on the adapted MIMIC-CXR dataset. We find that our
re-trained model--which we call CXR-ReDonE--outperforms previous report
generation methods on clinical metrics, achieving an average BERTScore of
0.2351 (2.57% absolute improvement). We expect our approach to be broadly
valuable in enabling current radiology report generation systems to be more
directly integrated into clinical pipelines.

same form under Lorentz transformations. Thus, we speculate that Fock's special
harmonic reference frames may have provided us a clue to derive the Einstein's
equations in some special class of non-inertial reference frames. Following
this clue, generalized Einstein's equations in some special non-inertial
reference frames are derived based on the theory of vacuum mechanics. If the
field is weak and the reference frame is quasi-inertial, these generalized
Einstein's equations reduce to Einstein's equations. Thus, this theory may also
explain all the experiments which support the theory of general relativity.

extracted from a corresponding body of text. To build the best solution, we
used three different models. The first model is an unmodified cross-lingual
version of the NLP model RoBERTa, known as XLM-RoBERTa, that is pretrained on
100 languages. The second model is based on the pretrained RoBERTa model with
an extra classification head for the question answering, but we used a custom

on and the additional finetuning on the Indic dataset. This hypothesis was
proven wrong because the paired RoBERTa models performed the best as the

since modelling uncertainties are non-ergodic variables, their consideration in
failure rate calculations offends the Poisson assumption of independent
crossings. This problem has been addressed in the literature, and errors found
negligible for small annual collapse failure rates. However, the errors could
be significant for serviceability limit states, and when failure rates are
integrated in time, to provide lifetime failure probabilities. Herein, we
present a novel formulation to fully avoid the error in integration of
non-ergodic variables. The proposed product-of-lognormals formulation is fully
compatible with popular fragility modelling approaches in PBE context.
Moreover, we address collapse limit states of realistic reinforced concrete
buildings, and find errors of the order of 5 to 8% for 50-year lifetimes, up to

  for astronaut training and space exploration",,,,,"cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The ongoing push to send humans back to the Moon and to Mars is giving rise
to a wide range of novel technical solutions in support of prospective
astronaut expeditions. Against this backdrop, the European Space Agency (ESA)
has recently launched an investigation into unobtrusive interface technologies
as a potential answer to such challenges. Three particular technologies have
shown promise in this regard: EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) provide
a non-invasive method of utilizing recorded electrical activity of a user's
brain, electromyography (EMG) enables monitoring of electrical signals
generated by the user's muscle contractions, and finally, eye tracking enables,
for instance, the tracking of user's gaze direction via camera recordings to
convey commands. Beyond simply improving the usability of prospective technical
solutions, our findings indicate that EMG, EEG, and eye-tracking could also
serve to monitor and assess a variety of cognitive states, including attention,
cognitive load, and mental fatigue of the user, while EMG could furthermore
also be utilized to monitor the physical state of the astronaut. In this paper,
we elaborate on the key strengths and challenges of these three enabling
technologies, and in light of ESA's latest findings, we reflect on their
applicability in the context of human space flight. Furthermore, a timeline of
technological readiness is provided. In so doing, this paper feeds into the
growing discourse on emerging technology and its role in paving the way for a
human return to the Moon and expeditions beyond the Earth's orbit.
