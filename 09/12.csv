right from the early days of this notion to the present time. The classic paper
of Shapley and Shubik \cite{Shapley1971assignment} introduced the ""right"" way
of exploiting the power of this theory, namely picking problems whose
LP-relaxations support polyhedra having integral vertices. So far, the latter
fact was established by showing that the constraint matrix of the underlying
linear system is {\em totally unimodular}.
  We attempt to take this methodology to its logical next step -- {\em using
total dual integrality} -- thereby addressing new classes of games which have
their origins in two major theories within combinatorial optimization, namely
perfect graphs and polymatroids. In the former, we address the stable set and
clique games and in the latter, we address the matroid independent set game.
For each of these games, we prove that the set of core imputations is precisely
the set of optimal solutions to the dual LPs.
  Another novelty is the way the worth of the game is allocated among
sub-coalitions. Previous works follow the {\em bottom-up process} of allocating
to individual agents; the allocation to a sub-coalition is simply the sum of
the allocations to its agents. The {\em natural process for our games is
top-down}. The optimal dual allocates to ""objects"" in the grand coalition; a
sub-coalition inherits the allocation of each object with which it has
non-empty intersection.

facial feature representation extracted from a blackbox face recognition
engine. Indeed, it is very challenging problem in practice due to the
limitations of abstracted information from the engine. We therefore introduce a
new method named Attention-based Bijective Generative Adversarial Networks in a
Distillation framework (DAB-GAN) to synthesize faces of a subject given his/her
extracted face recognition features. Given any unconstrained unseen facial
features of a subject, the DAB-GAN can reconstruct his/her faces in high
definition. The DAB-GAN method includes a novel attention-based generative
structure with the new defined Bijective Metrics Learning approach. The
framework starts by introducing a bijective metric so that the distance
measurement and metric learning process can be directly adopted in image domain
for an image reconstruction task. The information from the blackbox face
recognition engine will be optimally exploited using the global distillation
process. Then an attention-based generator is presented for a highly robust
generator to synthesize realistic faces with ID preservation. We have evaluated
our method on the challenging face recognition databases, i.e. CelebA, LFW,
AgeDB, CFP-FP, and consistently achieved the state-of-the-art results. The
advancement of DAB-GAN is also proven on both image realism and ID preservation
properties.

to turbulence. In flows dominated by inner-cylinder rotation, a sequence of
linear instabilities leads to temporally chaotic dynamics as the rotation speed
is increased. The resulting flow patterns occupy the whole system and
sequentially lose spatial symmetry and coherence in the transition process. In
flows dominated by outer-cylinder rotation, the transition is abrupt and leads
directly to turbulent flow regions that compete with laminar ones. We here
review the main features of these two routes to turbulence. Bifurcation theory
rationalises the origin of temporal chaos in both cases. However, the
catastrophic transition of flows dominated by outer-cylinder rotation can only
be understood by accounting for the spatial proliferation of turbulent regions
with a statistical approach. We stress the role of the rotation number (the
ratio of Coriolis to inertial forces) and show that it determines the lower

we use a bilevel optimization problem to represent the adversarial rationale of
a cyberattacker in the upper level. In the lower level, we model disruptions in
the electric power network using an optimal power flow model. In the second
stage, we couple the disruption of electricity supply with a Computable General

unserved electric load in Long Island to 13% and affect almost 600,000

introduce weak perspective representations of hyperplane arrangements to

this paper, we propose a feature randomization-based approach that resists
eight adversarial attacks targeting deep learning models in the testing phase.

the most prevalent types of adversarial attacks. We evaluate the robustness of

consists of fine-tuning the network model against specific adversarial attacks.
Finally, our experimental results show that our methodology can secure the

explicitly describes the distance and the direction of each point's movement.
Scene flow estimation is used in various applications such as autonomous
driving fields, activity recognition, and virtual reality fields. As it is
challenging to annotate scene flow with ground truth for real-world data, this
leaves no real-world dataset available to provide a large amount of data with
ground truth for scene flow estimation. Therefore, many works use synthesized
data to pre-train their network and real-world LiDAR data to finetune. Unlike
the previous unsupervised learning of scene flow in point clouds, we propose to
use odometry information to assist the unsupervised learning of scene flow and
use real-world LiDAR data to train our network. Supervised odometry provides
more accurate shared cost volume for scene flow. In addition, the proposed
network has mask-weighted warp layers to get a more accurate predicted point
cloud. The warp operation means applying an estimated pose transformation or
scene flow to a source point cloud to obtain a predicted point cloud and is the
key to refining scene flow from coarse to fine. When performing warp
operations, the points in different states use different weights for the pose
transformation and scene flow transformation. We classify the states of points
as static, dynamic, and occluded, where the static masks are used to divide
static and dynamic points, and the occlusion masks are used to divide occluded
points. The mask-weighted warp layer indicates that static masks and occlusion
masks are used as weights when performing warp operations. Our designs are
proved to be effective in ablation experiments. The experiment results show the
promising prospect of an odometry-assisted unsupervised learning method for 3D
scene flow in real-world data.

precipitation across the basin. In this work we propose Gaussian processes with
structured non-stationary kernels to model precipitation patterns in the UIB.
Previous attempts to quantify or model precipitation in the Hindu Kush
Karakoram Himalayan region have often been qualitative or include crude
assumptions and simplifications which cannot be resolved at lower resolutions.
This body of research also provides little to no error propagation. We account
for the spatial variation in precipitation with a non-stationary Gibbs kernel
parameterised with an input dependent lengthscale. This allows the posterior
function samples to adapt to the varying precipitation patterns inherent in the
distinct underlying topography of the Indus region. The input dependent
lengthscale is governed by a latent Gaussian process with a stationary
squared-exponential kernel to allow the function level hyperparameters to vary
smoothly. In ablation experiments we motivate each component of the proposed
kernel by demonstrating its ability to model the spatial covariance, temporal
structure and joint spatio-temporal reconstruction. We benchmark our model with

relies on judiciously engineered balanced gain and loss mechanisms. Creating
gain requires complex circuits and amplification mechanisms, making engineering
applications challenging. Here, we report strategies to achieve EPs in passive
non-Hermitian elastodynamic systems with differential loss derived from
viscoelastic materials. We compare different viscoelastic material models and
show that the EP emerges only when the frequency-dependent loss-tangent of the
viscoelastic material remains nearly constant in the frequency range of
operation. Such type of loss tangent occurs in materials that undergo
stress-relaxation over a broad spectrum of relaxation times, for example,

than system-level, mainly focusing on a subset of mathematics-amenable ethical
principles (such as fairness). Nevertheless, ethical issues can occur at any
step of the development lifecycle crosscutting many AI and non-AI components of
systems beyond AI algorithms and models. To operationalize responsible AI from
a system perspective, in this paper, we present a Responsible AI Pattern
Catalogue based on the results of a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR). Rather
than staying at the principle or algorithm level, we focus on patterns that AI
system stakeholders can undertake in practice to ensure that the developed AI
systems are responsible throughout the entire governance and engineering

three groups: multi-level governance patterns, trustworthy process patterns,
and responsible-AI-by-design product patterns. These patterns provide a
systematic and actionable guidance for stakeholders to implement responsible
AI.

Current perception methods generally require 360{\deg} point clouds, collected
sequentially as the LiDAR scans the azimuth and acquires consecutive
wedge-shaped slices. The acquisition latency of a full scan (~ 100ms) may lead
to outdated perception which is detrimental to safe operation. Recent streaming
perception works proposed directly processing LiDAR slices and compensating for
the narrow field of view (FOV) of a slice by reusing features from preceding
slices. These works, however, are all based on a single modality and require
past information which may be outdated. Meanwhile, images from high-frequency
cameras can support streaming models as they provide a larger FoV compared to a
LiDAR slice. However, this difference in FoV complicates sensor fusion. To
address this research gap, we propose an innovative camera-LiDAR streaming 3D
object detection framework that uses camera images instead of past LiDAR slices
to provide an up-to-date, dense, and wide context for streaming perception. The
proposed method outperforms prior streaming models on the challenging NuScenes
benchmark. It also outperforms powerful full-scan detectors while being much
faster. Our method is shown to be robust to missing camera images, narrow LiDAR

order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition in finite temperature
QCD. Our work is based on the Hamiltonian approach in Coulomb gauge where
finite temperature $T$ is introduced by compactifying one space direction. We
briefly review this approach and extend earlier work in the Yang-Mills sector
by including dynamical quarks. In a first approximation, we follow the usual
functional approach and include only one-loop contributions to the energy, with
the finite temperature propagators replaced by their $T=0$ counter parts. It is
found that this gives a poor description of the phase transition, in particular
for the case of full QCD with $N_f = 3$ light flavours. The physical reasons
for this unexpected result are discussed, and pinned down to a relative
weakness of gluon confinement compared to the deconfining tendency of the
quarks. We attempt to overcome this issue by including the relevant gluon
contributions from the two-loop terms to the energy. We find that the two-loop
corrections have indeed a tendency to strengthen the gluon confinement and
weaken the unphysical effects in the confining phase, while slightly increasing
the (pseudo-)critical temperature $T^\ast$ at the same time. To fully suppress
artifacts in the confining phase, we must tune the parameters to rather large
values, increasing the critical temperature to $T^\ast \approx
340\,\mathrm{MeV}$ for $G=SU(2)$.

ratio model and an imputation model, to combine transfer learning and
surrogate-assisted semi-supervised learning strategies organically and achieve
triple robustness. While the STRIFLE approach requires the target and source
populations to share the same conditional distribution of outcome Y given both
the surrogate features S and predictors X, it allows the true underlying model
of Y|X to differ between the two populations due to the potential covariate
shift in S and X. Different from double robustness, even if both nuisance
models are misspecified or the distribution of Y|S,X is not the same between
the two populations, when the transferred source population and the target
population share enough similarities, the triply robust STRIFLE estimator can
still partially utilize the source population, and it is guaranteed to be no
worse than the target-only surrogate-assisted semi-supervised estimator with
negligible errors. These desirable properties of our estimator are established
theoretically and verified in finite-sample via extensive simulation studies.

major challenge for developing such models lies in the inherent constraint of
non-negativity and unit integral for the functional space of density outcomes.
To overcome this fundamental issue, we propose Wasserstein Distributional

further develop an efficient algorithm based on Majorization-Minimization
optimization with boosted trees. Compared with methods in the previous
literature, WDL better characterizes and uncovers the nonlinear dependence of
the conditional densities, and their derived summary statistics. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the WDL framework through simulations and real-world

between teacher and student? -- have received limited formal study. In this
paper, we propose Switchable Online Knowledge Distillation (SwitOKD), to answer
these questions. Instead of focusing on the accuracy gap at test phase by the
existing arts, the core idea of SwitOKD is to adaptively calibrate the gap at
training phase, namely distillation gap, via a switching strategy between two
modes -- expert mode (pause the teacher while keep the student learning) and
learning mode (restart the teacher). To possess an appropriate distillation
gap, we further devise an adaptive switching threshold, which provides a formal
criterion as to when to switch to learning mode or expert mode, and thus
improves the student's performance. Meanwhile, the teacher benefits from our
adaptive switching threshold and keeps basically on a par with other online
arts. We further extend SwitOKD to multiple networks with two basis topologies.
Finally, extensive experiments and analysis validate the merits of SwitOKD for
classification over the state-of-the-arts. Our code is available at

methods relying on stochastic ordering have been developed to create ""fairer""
rankings that reduce inequality in who or what is shown to users. Complete
randomization -- ordering candidate items randomly, independent of estimated

most equal distribution of exposure. In industry settings, recommender systems
often operate via a two-step process in which candidate items are first

  In this paper, we consider the effects of inequality at the first step and
show that, paradoxically, complete randomization at the second step can result
in a higher degree of inequality relative to deterministic ordering of items by
estimated relevance scores. In light of this observation, we then propose a
simple post-processing algorithm in pursuit of reducing exposure inequality

distributed interacting brain regions to encode information. How to understand
the underlying cognition function mechanism of working memory is a challenging
problem, which involves neural circuit configuration from multiple brain
regions as well as stochastic transition dynamics between brain states. The
energy landscape idea provides a tool to study the global stability and
stochastic transition dynamics in the distributed cognitive function system.
However, how to quantify the energy landscape in a realistic large-scale brain
network remains unclear. Here, based on an anatomically constrained
computational model of large-scale macaque cortex, we quantified the underlying
multistable attractor landscape of distributed working memory. In the absence
of external stimulation, the landscape exhibits three stable attractors, a
spontaneous state, and two memory states. In the attractor landscape framework,
the working memory function is governed by the change of landscape topography
and the switch of system state according to the task requirement. The barrier
height inferred from landscape topography quantifies the global stability of
memory state and robustness to non-selective random fluctuations and distractor
stimuli. The kinetic transition path identified by the minimum action path
approach reveals that the spontaneous state serves as an intermediate state
during the switch between the two memory states, the memory stored in the
cortical area with higher hierarchy is more stable, and information flow
follows the direction of hierarchical structure. These results provide new
insights into the underlying mechanism of distributed working memory function,
and the landscape and kinetic path approach can be applied to other cognitive
function-related problems in brain networks.

$E_{7(-25)}(\mathbb{Z})$ acts as the discrete conformal group of the
exceptional Jordan algebra $J_3^{\mathbb{O}}(\mathcal{R})$ over the integral
octonions of Coxeter $\mathcal{R}$. The charges of the black holes take values
on the lattice defined by $J_3^{\mathbb{O}}(\mathcal{R})$. Degeneracies of rank
one and rank two quantum BPS black holes are given by the Fourier coefficients
of singular modular forms $E_4(Z)$ of weight 4 and $E_8(Z)=(E_4(Z))^2$ of
weight 8 of $E_{7(-25)}(\mathbb{Z})$. The degeneracies of rank 3 BPS black
holes are given by the Fourier coefficients of the powers $(E_4(Z))^n$ of
$E_4(Z)$ for $n>2$. Using the results of Elkies and Gross on the embeddings of
cubic rings $A$ into the exceptional Jordan algebra and their action on the 24
dimensional orthogonal quadratic subspace of $J_3^{\mathbb{O}}(\mathcal{R})$,
we show that the degeneracies of rank one black holes described by such
embeddings are given by the Fourier coefficients of the Hilbert modular forms
of $SL(2,A)$ which is a discrete subgroup of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})^3$. If the
discriminant of the cubic ring is $D=p^2$ with $p$ a prime number then the
isotropic lines in the 24 dimensional quadratic space define a pair of Niemeier
lattices which can be taken as charge lattices of some BPS black holes. For
$p=7$ they are the Leech lattice with no roots and the lattice $A_6^4$ with 168
root vectors. We also review the current status of the searches for the
M/superstring theoretic origins of the octonionic magical supergravity.

proposing a new family of evaluation metrics where the existing popular metrics
(e.g., nDCG, MAP) are customized by introducing a query-specific lower-bound
(LB) normalization term. While original nDCG, MAP etc. metrics are normalized
in terms of their upper bounds based on an ideal ranked list, a corresponding
LB normalization for them has not yet been studied. Specifically, we introduce
two different variants of the proposed LB normalization, where the lower bound
is estimated from a randomized ranking of the corresponding documents present
in the evaluation set. We next conducted two case-studies by instantiating the
new framework for two popular IR evaluation metric (with two variants, e.g.,
DCG_UL_V1,2 and MSP_UL_V1,2 ) and then comparing against the traditional metric
without the proposed LB normalization. Experiments on two different data-sets
with eight Learning-to-Rank (LETOR) methods demonstrate the following
properties of the new LB normalized metric: 1) Statistically significant
differences (between two methods) in terms of original metric no longer remain
statistically significant in terms of Upper Lower (UL) Bound normalized version
and vice-versa, especially for uninformative query-sets. 2) When compared
against the original metric, our proposed UL normalized metrics demonstrate
higher Discriminatory Power and better Consistency across different data-sets.
These findings suggest that the IR community should consider UL normalization
seriously when computing nDCG and MAP and more in-depth study of UL
normalization for general IR evaluation is warranted.

of the Universe in the current era. However, there is a $4.4\sigma$ discrepancy
between the measurements from the early Universe and the late Universe. In this
research, we propose a model-free and distance-free method to constrain

geometrical relation of the proper motion of extragalactic jets, the lower
limit ($H_{\rm 0,min}$) of $H_{0}$ can be determined using only three
cosmology-free observables: the redshifts of the host galaxies, as well as the
approaching and receding angular velocities of radio jets. Using these, we
propose to use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test) between cumulative
distribution functions of $H_{\rm 0,min}$ to differentiate cosmology. We
simulate 100, 200, and 500 extragalactic jets with 3 levels of accuracy of the
proper motion ($\mu_{a}$ and $\mu_{r}$), at $10\%$, $5\%$, and $1\%$,
corresponding to the accuracies of the current and future radio
interferometers. We perform K-S tests between the simulated samples as
theoretical distributions with different $H_{0}$ and power-law index of
velocity distribution of jets and mock observational data. Our result suggests
increasing sample sizes leads to tighter constraints on both power-law index
and the Hubble constant at moderate accuracy (i.e., $10\%$ and $5\%$) while at
$1\%$ accuracy, increasing sample sizes leads to tighter constraints on
power-law index more. Improving accuracy results in better constraints in the
Hubble constant compared with the power-law index in all cases but it
alleviates the degeneracy.

The advantage of collaborative machine learning (CML) over most conventional ML
lies in the joint effort of decentralized nodes or agents that results in
better model performance and generalization. As the training of ML models
requires a massive amount of good quality data, it is necessary to eliminate
concerns about data privacy and ensure high-quality data. To solve this
problem, we cast our eyes on the integration of CML and smart contracts. Based
on blockchain, smart contracts enable automatic execution of data preserving
and validation, as well as the continuity of CML model training. In our
simulation experiments, we define incentive mechanisms on the smart contract,
investigate the important factors such as the number of features in the dataset
(num_words), the size of the training data, the cost for the data holders to
submit data, etc., and conclude how these factors impact the performance
metrics of the model: the accuracy of the trained model, the gap between the
accuracies of the model before and after simulation, and the time to use up the
balance of bad agent. For instance, the increase of the value of num_words
leads to higher model accuracy and eliminates the negative influence of
malicious agents in a shorter time from our observation of the experiment
results. Statistical analyses show that with the help of smart contracts, the
influence of invalid data is efficiently diminished and model robustness is
maintained. We also discuss the gap in existing research and put forward

integrate solar energy harvesting materials with the human living environment,
such as building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs). This places requirements on
developing colored covers with a trade-off between efficiency and aesthetics,
providing a new stage for the large-scale application of structural color
technologies. Here in this study, we have investigated the theoretic
feasibility of employing the photonic glass, a random packing of monodisperse
dielectric microspheres, as the colored cover for solar energy harvesting.
Based on numerous optical simulations, we have evaluated the color and average
solar transmissivity (AST) of the photonic glasses with varying parameters.
Results show that using non-absorbing microspheres with relatively high
refractive index, about 3 {\mu}m thick photonic glasses could enable colors
with lightness over 50 while keeping AST at around 80%. Besides, we demonstrate
that due to the short-range structural correlation, photonic glasses could
generate purple, blue, cyan, light green, and grey colors, but cannot help with
yellow and red color hues. Finally, the effects of several enhancement methods
are clarified, and possible ways for expanding the color range are
demonstrated. These results provide a comprehensive guide to the practical
implementations of structural color using photonic glasses, particularly in the
colorization of solar energy materials.

Motivated by the recent synthesis of monolayer $\mathrm{Si_2Te_2}$, we explore
a family of 2D materials, termed as the Janus Si dichalcogenides (JSD), which
parallel the Janus transition metal dichalcogenides and exhibit even stronger
inversion asymmetry. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate
excellent stability of these materials. We show that their strong structural
asymmetry leads to pronounced intrinsic polar field, sizable spin splitting due
to spin-orbit coupling, and large piezoelectric response. The spin splitting
involves an out-of-plane component, which is beyond the linear Rashba model.
The piezoelectric tensor has large value in both in-plane $d_{11}$ coefficient
and out-of-plane $d_{31}$ coefficient, making the monolayer JSDs distinct among
the existing 2D piezoelectrics. In addition, we find interesting strain-induced
phase transitions in these materials. Particularly, there are multiple valleys
in the conduction band that compete for the conduction band minimum, which will
lead to notable changes in optical and transport properties under strain. Our
work reveals a new family of Si based 2D materials, which could find promising
applications in spintronic and piezoelectric devices.

furnishes a unique environment to study the turbulent fluctuations at the small

the turbulence is dissipated and plasma is heated. How does the turbulence in
the magnetized plasma control the energy transport process in space and
astrophysical plasmas is an attractive and challenging open problem of the 21st
century. For this, the literature discusses three types of magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) waves/ fluctuations in magnetized plasma as the magnetosonic (fast),
Alfv'enic (intermediate), and sonic (slow). The magnetosonic type is most
common in the interplanetary medium. However, Alfv'enic waves/fluctuations have
not been identified to date in the ICME sheath. The steepening of the Alfv'en
wave can form a rotational discontinuity that leads to an Alfv'enic shock. But,
the questions were raised on their existence based on the theoretical ground.
Here, we demonstrate the observable in-situ evidence of Alfv'en waves inside
turbulent shock-sheath at 1 AU using three different methods desciribed in the
literature. We also estimate Els""asser variables, normalized cross helicity,
normalized residual energy and which indicate outward flow of Alfv'en waves.
Power spectrum analysis of IMF indicates the existence of Alfv'enic turbulence

subdifferential~\citep{Goldstein-1977-Optimization} and uniform smoothing,
thereby providing the basis and intuition for the design of gradient-free
methods that guarantee the finite-time convergence to a set of Goldstein
stationary points. Second, we propose the gradient-free method (GFM) and
stochastic GFM for solving a class of nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems
and prove that both of them can return a $(\delta,\epsilon)$-Goldstein
stationary point of a Lipschitz function $f$ at an expected convergence rate at
$O(d^{3/2}\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-4})$ where $d$ is the problem dimension.
Two-phase versions of GFM and SGFM are also proposed and proven to achieve
improved large-deviation results. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
2-SGFM on training ReLU neural networks with the \textsc{Minst} dataset.

  Re-Identification?",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies show that models trained on synthetic datasets are able to
achieve better generalizable person re-identification (GPReID) performance than
that trained on public real-world datasets. On the other hand, due to the
limitations of real-world person ReID datasets, it would also be important and
interesting to use large-scale synthetic datasets as test sets to benchmark
person ReID algorithms. Yet this raises a critical question: is synthetic
dataset reliable for benchmarking generalizable person re-identification? In
the literature there is no evidence showing this. To address this, we design a
method called Pairwise Ranking Analysis (PRA) to quantitatively measure the
ranking similarity and perform the statistical test of identical distributions.
Specifically, we employ Kendall rank correlation coefficients to evaluate
pairwise similarity values between algorithm rankings on different datasets.
Then, a non-parametric two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is performed for
the judgement of whether algorithm ranking correlations between synthetic and
real-world datasets and those only between real-world datasets lie in identical
distributions. We conduct comprehensive experiments, with ten representative
algorithms, three popular real-world person ReID datasets, and three recently
released large-scale synthetic datasets. Through the designed pairwise ranking
analysis and comprehensive evaluations, we conclude that a recent large-scale
synthetic dataset ClonedPerson can be reliably used to benchmark GPReID,
statistically the same as real-world datasets. Therefore, this study guarantees
the usage of synthetic datasets for both source training set and target testing
set, with completely no privacy concerns from real-world surveillance data.
Besides, the study in this paper might also inspire future designs of synthetic
datasets.

simulation, is one of the most promising usage of quantum computers. For
time-independent Hamiltonians, qubitization has recently established efficient
realization of time-evolution $U(t)=e^{-iHt}$, with achieving the optimal
computational resource both in time $t$ and an allowable error $\varepsilon$.
In contrast, those for time-dependent systems require larger cost due to the
difficulty of handling time-dependency. In this paper, we establish
optimal/nearly-optimal Hamiltonian simulation for generic time-dependent
systems with time-periodicity, known as Floquet systems. By using a so-called
Floquet-Hilbert space equipped with auxiliary states labeling Fourier indices,
we develop a way to certainly obtain the target time-evolved state without
relying on either time-ordered product or Dyson-series expansion. Consequently,
the query complexity, which measures the cost for implementing the
time-evolution, has optimal and nearly-optimal dependency respectively in time
$t$ and inverse error $\varepsilon$, and becomes sufficiently close to that of
qubitization. Thus, our protocol tells us that, among generic time-dependent
systems, time-periodic systems provides a class accessible as efficiently as
time-independent systems despite the existence of time-dependency. As we also
provide applications to simulation of nonequilibrium phenomena and adiabatic
state preparation, our results will shed light on nonequilibrium phenomena in
condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry, and quantum tasks yielding
time-dependency in quantum computation.

approaches have recently gained much attention to avoid the usage of a set of
different networks for various compression rates. Despite the remarkable
performance that has been achieved, these approaches would be readily corrupted
once multiple compression/decompression operations are executed, resulting in
the fact that image quality would be tremendously dropped and strong artifacts
would appear. Thus, we try to tackle the issue of high-fidelity fine
variable-rate image compression and propose the Invertible Activation
Transformation (IAT) module. We implement the IAT in a mathematical invertible
manner on a single rate Invertible Neural Network (INN) based model and the
quality level (QLevel) would be fed into the IAT to generate scaling and bias
tensors. IAT and QLevel together give the image compression model the ability
of fine variable-rate control while better maintaining the image fidelity.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the single rate image compression model
equipped with our IAT module has the ability to achieve variable-rate control
without any compromise. And our IAT-embedded model obtains comparable
rate-distortion performance with recent learning-based image compression
methods. Furthermore, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art variable-rate

are often vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Intensive research efforts have
been made to improve the robustness of DNNs; however, most empirical defenses
can be adaptively attacked again, and the theoretically certified robustness is
limited, especially on large-scale datasets. One potential root cause of such
vulnerabilities for DNNs is that although they have demonstrated powerful
expressiveness, they lack the reasoning ability to make robust and reliable
predictions. In this paper, we aim to integrate domain knowledge to enable
robust learning with the reasoning paradigm. In particular, we propose a
certifiably robust learning with reasoning pipeline (CARE), which consists of a
learning component and a reasoning component. Concretely, we use a set of
standard DNNs to serve as the learning component to make semantic predictions,
and we leverage the probabilistic graphical models, such as Markov logic
networks (MLN), to serve as the reasoning component to enable knowledge/logic
reasoning. However, it is known that the exact inference of MLN (reasoning) is
#P-complete, which limits the scalability of the pipeline. To this end, we
propose to approximate the MLN inference via variational inference based on an
efficient expectation maximization algorithm. In particular, we leverage graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) to encode the posterior distribution during
variational inference and update the parameters of GCNs (E-step) and the
weights of knowledge rules in MLN (M-step) iteratively. We conduct extensive
experiments on different datasets and show that CARE achieves significantly
higher certified robustness compared with the state-of-the-art baselines. We
additionally conducted different ablation studies to demonstrate the empirical
robustness of CARE and the effectiveness of different knowledge integration.

town being the presence in some cases of a bouncing behavior in the radial

singularity-removal has been achieved: completeness of (null and time-like)
geodesic paths, impact of unbound curvature divergences, analysis of causal
contact upon congruences of geodesics, paths of observers with (bound)
acceleration, and propagation of (scalar) waves. We further elaborate on the

the observation history into the finite-dimensional memory. Because this
compression simplifies the estimation among the agents, ML-DSC can be solved in
more general cases based on the mean-field control theory. We demonstrate
ML-DSC in the general LQG problem. Because estimation and control are not
clearly separated in the general LQG problem, the Riccati equation is modified

Leonis. The event presents a rare case of a stellar flare observed
simultaneously in X-rays (with XMM-Newton) and in optical (with the Transiting

X-ray band ($1.26 \pm 0.01 \cdot 10^{33}$ erg) and the bolometric value
($E_{F,bol} = 5.57 \pm 0.03 \cdot 10^{33}$ erg) put this event at the lower end
of the superflare class. The exceptional photon statistics deriving from the
proximity of AD Leo has enabled measurements in the 1-8 AA GOES band for the
peak flux (X1445 class) and integrated energy ($E_{F,GOES} = 4.30 \pm 0.05
\cdot 10^{32}$ erg), making possible a direct comparison with data on flares
from our Sun. From extrapolations of empirical relations for solar flares we
estimate that a proton flux of at least $10^5\,{cm^{-2} s^{-1} sr^{-1}}$
accompanied the radiative output. With a time lag of 300s between the peak of
the TESS white-light flare and the GOES band flare peak as well as a clear
Neupert effect this event follows very closely the standard (solar) flare
scenario. Time-resolved spectroscopy during the X-ray flare reveals, in
addition to the time evolution of plasma temperature and emission measure, a
temporary increase of electron density and elemental abundances, and a loop
that extends in the corona by 13% of the stellar radius ($4 \cdot 10^9$ cm).
Independent estimates of the footprint area of the flare from TESS and
XMM-Newton data suggest a high temperature of the optical flare (25000 K), but
we consider more likely that the optical and X-ray flare areas represent
physically distinct regions in the atmosphere of AD Leo.

possible to accelerate the preliminary phases by using computer simulations. In
particular, virtual screening is an in-silico phase that is needed to filter a
large set of possible drug candidates to a manageable number. This paper
presents the implementations and a comparative analysis of two GPU-optimized
implementations of a virtual screening algorithm targeting novel GPU
architectures. The first adopts a traditional approach that spreads the
computation required to evaluate a single molecule across the entire GPU. The
second uses a batched approach that exploits the parallel architecture of the
GPU to evaluate more molecules in parallel, without considering the latency to
process a single molecule. The paper describes the advantages and disadvantages
of the proposed solutions, highlighting implementation details that impact the
performance. Experimental results highlight the different performance of the
two methods on several target molecule databases while running on NVIDIA A100
GPUs. The two implementations have a strong dependency with respect to the data
to be processed. For both cases, the performance is improving while reducing
the dimension of the target molecules (number of atoms and rotatable bonds).
The two methods demonstrated a different behavior with respect to the size of
the molecule database to be screened. While the latency one reaches sooner
(with fewer molecules) the performance plateau in terms of throughput, the
batched one requires a larger set of molecules. However, the performances after
the initial transient period are much higher (up to 5x speed-up). Finally, to
check the efficiency of both implementations we deeply analyzed their workload
characteristics using the instruction roof-line methodology.

explored the possibility of reconstructing 3D skeletons or meshes from the
noisy and sparse mmWave Radar signals. However, it is unclear how accurately we
can reconstruct the 3D body from the mmWave signals across scenes and how it
performs compared with cameras, which are important aspects needed to be
considered when either using mmWave radars alone or combining them with
cameras. To answer these questions, an automatic 3D body annotation system is
first designed and built up with multiple sensors to collect a large-scale
dataset. The dataset consists of synchronized and calibrated mmWave radar point
clouds and RGB(D) images in different scenes and skeleton/mesh annotations for
humans in the scenes. With this dataset, we train state-of-the-art methods with
inputs from different sensors and test them in various scenarios. The results
demonstrate that 1) despite the noise and sparsity of the generated point
clouds, the mmWave radar can achieve better reconstruction accuracy than the
RGB camera but worse than the depth camera; 2) the reconstruction from the
mmWave radar is affected by adverse weather conditions moderately while the
RGB(D) camera is severely affected. Further, analysis of the dataset and the
results shadow insights on improving the reconstruction from the mmWave radar

  Neural Ranking Models",,,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Neural ranking models (NRMs) have become one of the most important techniques
in information retrieval (IR). Due to the limitation of relevance labels, the
training of NRMs heavily relies on negative sampling over unlabeled data. In
general machine learning scenarios, it has shown that training with hard
negatives (i.e., samples that are close to positives) could lead to better
performance. Surprisingly, we find opposite results from our empirical studies
in IR. When sampling top-ranked results (excluding the labeled positives) as
negatives from a stronger retriever, the performance of the learned NRM becomes
even worse. Based on our investigation, the superficial reason is that there
are more false negatives (i.e., unlabeled positives) in the top-ranked results
with a stronger retriever, which may hurt the training process; The root is the
existence of pooling bias in the dataset constructing process, where annotators
only judge and label very few samples selected by some basic retrievers.
Therefore, in principle, we can formulate the false negative issue in training
NRMs as learning from labeled datasets with pooling bias. To solve this
problem, we propose a novel Coupled Estimation Technique (CET) that learns both
a relevance model and a selection model simultaneously to correct the pooling
bias for training NRMs. Empirical results on three retrieval benchmarks show
that NRMs trained with our technique can achieve significant gains on ranking
effectiveness against other baseline strategies.

strategy to train neural networks to estimate high-quality subpixel disparity
maps for semi-dense active stereo vision. The key insight is that neural
networks can double their accuracy if they are able to jointly learn how to
refine the disparity map while invalidating the pixels where there is
insufficient information to correct the disparity estimate. Our approach is
based on Bayesian modeling where validated and invalidated pixels are defined
by their stochastic properties, allowing the model to learn how to choose by
itself which pixels are worth its attention. Using active stereo datasets such

outperforms the current state-of-the-art active stereo models. We also

large fluctuations in the statistical distribution of condensate phonons and
that the Mandel-Q factor which characterizes fluctuations becomes negative in
the limit of excessive external energy input. In contrast with the cold atom
equilibrium BEC, the Fr\""ohlich condensate is a result of the nonequilibrium
driving where the pump plays a role of setting the number of particles, and the
medium plays a role of setting the temperature. Hence, BEC can either arise by
reducing the medium temperature at fixed pump (equilibrium case), or by
increasing the pump at fixed medium temperature (nonequilibrium case).

new capabilities of the new telescopes, these periodic motions are routinely
observed. Oscillations in filaments show key aspects of their structure. A
systematic study of filament oscillations over the solar cycle can shed light
on the evolution of the prominences. This work is a proof of concept that aims
to automatically detect and parameterise such oscillations using H$\alpha$ data
from the GONG network of telescopes. The proposed technique studies the
periodic fluctuations of every pixel of the H$\alpha$ data cubes. Using the FFT
we compute the power spectral density (PSD). We define a criterion to consider
whether it is a real oscillation or whether it is a spurious fluctuation. This
consists in considering that the peak in the PSD must be greater than several
times the background noise with a confidence level of 95\%. The background
noise is well fitted to a combination of red and white noise. We applied the
method to several observations already reported in the literature to determine
its reliability. We also applied the method to a test case, which is a data set
in which the oscillations of the filaments were not known a priori. The method
shows that there are areas in the filaments with PSD above the threshold value.
The periodicities obtained are in general agreement with the values obtained by
other methods. In the test case, the method detects oscillations in several
filaments. We conclude that the proposed spectral technique is a powerful tool
to automatically detect oscillations in prominences using H$\alpha$ data.

necessarily aligned with the driving pressure gradient. Pralits et al. Phys.
Rev. Fluids 2, 013901 (2017) investigated the same problem and reported that a
proper tilt angle of the microgrooves about the driving pressure gradient can
reduce the critical Reynolds number and that the flow with a single
superhydrophobic wall is much more unstable/less stable than that with two
superhydrophobic walls. In contrast, we show that the lowest critical Reynolds
number is always realized with two superhydrophobic walls, and we obtain
critical Reynolds numbers significantly lower than the reported. Besides, we
show that the critical Reynolds number can be further reduced by increasing the
anisotropy in the slip length. As the tilt angle changes, there appears to be a
strong correlation between the strength of the instability and the magnitude of
the cross-flow component of the base flow incurred by the tilt angle. In case
the tilt angles of the microgrooves differ on the two walls, the critical
Reynolds number increases as the difference in the tilt angles increases, i.e.
two superhydrophobic walls with parallel microgrooves give the lowest critical
Reynolds number. The results are informative for designing the microgroove-type
wall texture to introduce instability at low Reynolds number channel flow,
which may be of interest for enhancing mixing or heat transfer in small flow
systems where turbulence cannot be triggered.

state-of-the-art methods utilize regularization, which penalizes the number of

contrast, regularization-based techniques often fail at feature recovery or
require thousands of observations to obtain similar accuracy. Regarding
out-of-sample generalization, we achieve improved or comparable cost

achieving high performance in electric drives, particularly targeted for
mission-critical applications. Unlike the saturation effects, the temperature
variations are difficult to predict, thus it is essential to track
temperature-dependent parameters online. In this paper, a unified framework is
developed for online parameter identification of rotating electric machines,
premised on the Recursive Prediction Error Method (RPEM). Secondly, the
prediction gradient ($\mathbf{\Psi}^T$)-based RPEM is adopted for
identification of the temperature-sensitive parameters, i.e., the permanent
magnet flux linkage ($\Psi_m$) and stator-winding resistance ($R_s$) of the
Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (IPMSM). Three algorithms,
namely, Stochastic Gradient (SGA), Gauss-Newton (GNA), and physically
interpretative method (PhyInt) are investigated for the estimation gains
computation. A speed-dependent gain-scheduling scheme is used to decouple the
inter-dependency of $\Psi_m$ and $R_s$. With the aid of offline simulation
methods, the main elements of RPEM such as $\mathbf{\Psi}^T$ are analyzed. The
concept validation and the choice of the optimal algorithm is made with the use
of System-on-Chip (SoC) based Embedded Real-Time Simulator (ERTS).
Subsequently, the selected algorithms are validated with the aid of a 3-kW,
IPMSM drive where the control and estimation routines are implemented in the
SoC-based industrial embedded control system. The experimental results reveal
that $\mathbf{\Psi}^T$-based RPEM, in general, can be a versatile technique in
temperature-sensitive parameter adaptation both online and offline.

software plays a critical role in exploiting the full potential of quantum
computing systems. As a result, it has been drawing increasing attention
recently to provide concepts, principles, and guidelines to address the ongoing
challenges of quantum software development. The importance of the topic
motivated us to voice out a call for action to develop a readiness model that
will help an organization assess its capability of migration from classic
software engineering to quan-tum software engineering. The proposed model will
be based on the existing multivocal literature, industrial empirical study,
understanding of the process areas, challenging factors and enablers that could
impact the quantum software engineering process. We believe that the proposed
model will provide a roadmap for software development organizations to measure
their readiness concerning to transformation from classic to quantum software
engineering by suggesting best practices and highlighting important process
areas, challeng-es, and enablers.

represented as ordinal variables, but also exploit the social network
describing the relationships between the users, we develop a hierarchical
Bayesian model termed ordinal graph factor analysis (OGFA), which jointly
models user-item and user-user interactions. OGFA not only achieves good
recommendation performance, but also extracts interpretable latent factors
corresponding to representative user preferences. We further extend OGFA to
ordinal graph gamma belief network, which is a multi-stochastic-layer deep
probabilistic model that captures the user preferences and social communities
at multiple semantic levels. For efficient inference, we develop a parallel
hybrid Gibbs-EM algorithm, which exploits the sparsity of the graphs and is
scalable to large datasets. Our experimental results show that the proposed
models not only outperform recent baselines on recommendation datasets with
explicit or implicit feedback, but also provide interpretable latent
representations.

generate the adaptively-binned Fermi Large Area Telescope light curve of this

such that all three flares consist of two-two sharp sub-flares. Based on radio
interferometric imaging data taken with the Very Large Array, we find that the
kpc-scale jet is directed towards west, while our analysis of $8.6$-GHz very
long baseline interferometry data, mostly taken with the Very Long Baseline

pointing towards south. We suggest that the misalignment of the kpc- and
pc-scale jets is a revealing signature of jet precession. We also analyze the
$5$-GHz total flux density curve of J1048+7143 taken with the Nanshan(Ur) and
RATAN-600 single dish radio telescopes and find two complete radio flares,
slightly lagging behind the $\gamma$-ray flares. We model the timing of
$\gamma$-ray flares as signature of the spin-orbit precession in a supermassive

are dynamically maintained up to the day of executing the schedule. At each day
preceding the execution of the schedule, disruptions occur due to sudden
unavailability of personnel, making the planned regular and reserve-crew
schedules infeasible for its execution day. This paper studies the fundamental
question how to repair the schedules' infeasibility in the days preceding the
execution, taking into account labor regulations. We propose a robust repair
strategy that maintains flexibility in order to cope with additional future
disruptions. The flexibility in reserve-crew usage is explicitly considered
through evaluating the expected shortfall of the reserve-crew schedule based on
a Markov chain formulation. The core of our approach relies on iteratively
solving a set-covering formulation, which we call the Robust Crew Recovery
Problem, which encapsulates this flexibility notion for reserve crew usage. A
tailored branch-and-price algorithm is developed for solving the Robust Crew
Recovery Problem to optimality. The corresponding pricing problem is
efficiently solved by a newly developed pulse algorithm. Based on actual data
from a medium-sized hub-and-spoke airline, we show that embracing our approach
leads to fewer flight cancellations and fewer last-minute alterations, compared
to repairing disrupted schedules without considering our robust measure.

unprecedented precision by AMS-02 up to TeV energies, and represent unique
probes for the local properties of our Galaxy. The interpretation of their
spectra is at present still debated, especially for the excess of positrons
above 10 GeV. The hypothesis that pulsars can significantly contribute to this
excess has been consolidated after the observation of gamma-ray halos at TeV
energies of a few degree size around Geminga and Monogem pulsars. However, the
spatial and energetic Galactic distribution of pulsars and the details of the
positron production, acceleration and release from these sources are not yet
fully understood. I will describe how we can use the high-precision AMS-02
positron data to constrain the main properties of the Galactic pulsar
population and of the positron acceleration needed to explain the observed
fluxes. This is achieved by simulating a large number of Galactic pulsar
populations, following the most recent self-consistent modelings for the pulsar
spin-down and evolution properties, calibrated on catalog observations. By
fitting the positron AMS-02 data together with a secondary component due to
collisions of primary cosmic rays with the interstellar medium, we determine
the physical parameters of the pulsars dominating the positron flux, and assess
the impact of different assumptions on radial distributions, spin-down
properties, Galactic propagation scenarios and positron emission time.

detection of an extremely bright and very soft X-ray flash of the classical

atmosphere, radiating at the Eddington luminosity, with a photosphere that is

consumption is increasing every year, and mobile networks account for a
significant portion of it. More than 50% of the total energy consumption of
mobile networks is issued from radio access networks (RANs), due mainly to the
rapid penetration of data-intensive applications and the increasing
heterogeneity, dynamicity, and unpredictability of traffic. To tackle these
high-demanding problems, RAN densification through the installation of
additional base stations in high-demand areas is conventionally used. However,
this leads to inefficient energy use and over-provisioning issues. In this
context, high altitude platform stations (HAPS) may be used to complement RANs
and sustain their services in densely populated areas, where traffic can peak
unpredictably. Due to their wide coverage areas, substantial communication
payloads, and green energy model, HAPS super macro base stations (SMBSs) are
capable of handling the massive and dynamic mobile data traffic of ground
users. In this paper, we show how HAPS-SMBSs can complement RANs and serve the
dynamic and unpredictable traffic demands of users in an energy-efficient
manner. Through the simulation of a case study, we demonstrate the performance
of a HAPS-SMBS compared to the conventional RAN densification method and
analyze the two approaches in terms of sustainability.

geometrically frustrated lattices is central for the properties of many
two-dimensional quantum materials. The triangular lattice antiferromagnet is a
canonical example of a frustrated system, and here we analyse the dynamics of a
hole in such a lattice focusing on observables that have become accessible in a
new generation of experiments. Using the $t$-$J$ model, we solve the problem
exactly within linear spin wave theory in the limit of strong magnetic
interactions, showing that the ground state is described by a coherent state of
spin waves. The derivation highlights the crucial role played by the
interaction between a static hole and the neighboring spins, which originates
in the geometric frustration and has often been omitted in earlier works.
Furthermore, we show that the non-equilibrium dynamics after a hole has
abruptly been inserted at a lattice site is given exactly by a coherent state
with time-dependent oscillatory coefficients. Physically, this describes a
burst of magnetic frustration propagating through only two-thirds of the
lattice sites, since a destructive interference of spin waves leaves spins
parallel to that removed by the hole unperturbed. After the wave has propagated
through the lattice, the magnetization relaxes to that of the ground state. We
then use our analytical solution to benchmark the widely used self-consistent
Born approximation (SCBA), showing that it is very accurate also for a
triangular lattice. The magnetic polaron spectrum is analysed for general
magnetic interactions using the SCBA, and we compare our results with those for
a square lattice.

We identify the optimal set of hyperparameters for imitation based on a

dynamically interact with nearby planetesimals in a disk. We build on this work
by: a) updating the census of discovered planet pairs, b) extending the study
to initially non-resonant as well as resonant planet pairs, c) using initial
planet and orbital properties directly guided by those observed, and d)
extending the initial period ratios to include both 2:1 and 3:2. We find that
1) interactions with planetesimals typically increase the period ratios of both
initially resonant and non-resonant planet pairs; 2) starting from an initially
flat period ratio distribution for systems across 3:2 and 2:1, these
interactions can naturally create the deficits observed narrow of these period
ratios; 3) contribution from initially resonant planet pairs is needed to
explain the observed levels of excess wide of 3:2; 4) a mixture model where
about 25% (1%) planet pairs were initially trapped into 3:2 (2:1) MMRs is
favored to explain both the observed deficit and excess of systems across these

remain in MMR today.

an independent set of size $k$, $I_0 = S$, $I_\ell = T$, and $I_{j+1}$ is

Sliding Optimization (TSO) problem asks whether there exists a sequence of at
most $\ell$ steps that transforms $S$ into $T$, where at each step we are
allowed to slide one token from a vertex to an unoccupied neighboring vertex.
In the Token Jumping Optimization (TJO) problem, at each step, we are allowed

Both TSO and TJO are known to be fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized

both problems become W[1]-hard already on $2$-degenerate graphs. Our positive
result makes use of the notion of independence covering families introduced by

centers, federated learning (FL) trains ML models over local datasets contained
on resource-constrained heterogeneous edge devices. Existing FL algorithms aim
to learn a single global model for all participating devices, which may not be
helpful to all devices participating in the training due to the heterogeneity
of the data across the devices. Recently, Hanzely and Richt\'{a}rik (2020)
proposed a new formulation for training personalized FL models aimed at
balancing the trade-off between the traditional global model and the local
models that could be trained by individual devices using their private data
only. They derived a new algorithm, called Loopless Gradient Descent (L2GD), to
solve it and showed that this algorithms leads to improved communication
complexity guarantees in regimes when more personalization is required. In this
paper, we equip their L2GD algorithm with a bidirectional compression mechanism
to further reduce the communication bottleneck between the local devices and
the server. Unlike other compression-based algorithms used in the FL-setting,
our compressed L2GD algorithm operates on a probabilistic communication
protocol, where communication does not happen on a fixed schedule. Moreover,
our compressed L2GD algorithm maintains a similar convergence rate as vanilla
SGD without compression. To empirically validate the efficiency of our
algorithm, we perform diverse numerical experiments on both convex and
non-convex problems and using various compression techniques.

learning methods. In particular, it is a neural operator. In recent times,
several types of neural operators have been developed, e.g., deep operator
networks, Graph neural operator (GNO), and Multiwavelet-based operator (MWTO).
Compared with other models, the FNO is computationally efficient and can learn
nonlinear operators between function spaces independent of a certain finite
basis. In this study, we investigated the bounding of the Rademacher complexity
of the FNO based on specific group norms. Using capacity based on these norms,
we bound the generalization error of the model. In addition, we investigated
the correlation between the empirical generalization error and the proposed
capacity of FNO. From the perspective of our result, we inferred that the type
of group norms determines the information about the weights and architecture of
the FNO model stored in the capacity. And then, we confirmed these inferences
through experiments. Based on this fact, we gained insight into the impact of
the number of modes used in the FNO model on the generalization error. And we
got experimental results that followed our insights.

antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the underlying non-monotonic physics. We

investigation from multiple disciplines. Several research groups, such as
Censored Planet, have deployed large scale Internet measurement platforms to
collect network reachability data. However, existing studies generally rely on
manually designed rules (i.e., using censorship fingerprints) to detect
network-based Internet censorship from the data. While this rule-based approach
yields a high true positive detection rate, it suffers from several challenges:
it requires human expertise, is laborious, and cannot detect any censorship not
captured by the rules. Seeking to overcome these challenges, we design and
evaluate a classification model based on latent feature representation learning
and an image-based classification model to detect network-based Internet
censorship.
  To infer latent feature representations fromnetwork reachability data, we
propose a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder to capture the structure and the
order of data elements in the data. To estimate the probability of censorship
events from the inferred latent features, we rely on a densely connected
multi-layer neural network model.
  Our image-based classification model encodes a network reachability data
record as a gray-scale image and classifies the image as censored or not using
a dense convolutional neural network. We compare and evaluate both approaches
using data sets from Censored Planet via a hold-out evaluation. Both
classification models are capable of detecting network-based Internet
censorship as we were able to identify instances of censorship not detected by
the known fingerprints. Latent feature representations likely encode more
nuances in the data since the latent feature learning approach discovers a
greater quantity, and a more diverse set, of new censorship instances.

guarantee the system's safety through set invariance. Together with a nominal
control method, it establishes a safety-critical control mechanism. The
resulting safety constraints can be enforced as hard constraints in quadratic
programming (QP) optimization, which rectifies the nominal control law based on
the set of safe inputs. In this work, we introduce a multiple CBFs scheme which
enforces several safety constraints with high relative degrees. This control
structure is essential in many challenging robotic applications that need to
meet several safety criteria simultaneously. In order to illustrate the
capabilities of the proposed method, we have addressed the problem of reactive
obstacle avoidance for a class of tractor-trailer systems. Safety is one of the
fundamental issues in autonomous tractor-trailer systems design. The lack of
fast response due to poor maneuverability makes reactive obstacle avoidance
difficult for these systems. We develop a control structure based on a multiple
CBFs scheme for a multi-steering tractor-trailer system to ensure a
collision-free maneuver for both the tractor and trailer in the presence of
several obstacles. Model predictive control is selected as the nominal tracking
controller, and the proposed control strategy is tested in several challenging

training images and expert annotations. This work describes a fully 3D
prototypical few-shot segmentation algorithm, such that the trained networks
can be effectively adapted to clinically interesting structures that are absent
in training, using only a few labelled images from a different institute.
First, to compensate for the widely recognised spatial variability between
institutions in episodic adaptation of novel classes, a novel spatial
registration mechanism is integrated into prototypical learning, consisting of
a segmentation head and an spatial alignment module. Second, to assist the
training with observed imperfect alignment, support mask conditioning module is
proposed to further utilise the annotation available from the support images.
Extensive experiments are presented in an application of segmenting eight
anatomical structures important for interventional planning, using a data set

demonstrate the efficacy in each of the 3D formulation, the spatial

wider range of surrounding elements and features to be perceived. However, when
the FoV of the camera reaches the negative half plane, traditional methods for
representing image feature points using [u,v,1]^T become ineffective. While the
panoramic FoV is advantageous for loop closure, its benefits are not easily
realized under large-attitude-angle differences where loop-closure frames
cannot be easily matched by existing methods. As loop closure on wide-FoV
panoramic data further comes with a large number of outliers, traditional
outlier rejection methods are not directly applicable. To address these issues,
we propose LF-SLAM, a SLAM framework for cameras with extremely large FoV with
loop closure. A three-dimensional vector with unit length is introduced to
effectively represent feature points even on the negative half plane. The
attitude information of the SLAM system is leveraged to guide the feature point
detection of the loop closure. Additionally, a new outlier rejection method
based on the unit length representation is integrated into the loop closure

discussing the impact of this improved model, which we term the Halevi model,
on the propagation of longitudinal volume modes, we accordingly extend the
Mie-Ruppin theory. Specifically, we derive the dispersion relation of
cylindrical surface plasmons. This reveals a nonlocal, collisional damping term
which is related to earlier phenomenological considerations of
limited-mean-free-path effects and influences both, peak width and amplitude of
corresponding resonances in the extinction spectrum. In addition, we transfer
the Halevi model into the time-domain thereby revealing a novel, diffusive
contribution to the current which shares certain similarities with
Cattaneo-type currents and analyze the resulting hybrid, diffusive-wave-like
motion. Further, we discuss the relation of the Halevi model to other
approaches commonly used in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate how to
implement the Halevi model into the Discontinuous-Galerkin Time-Domain
finite-element Maxwell solver and are able to identify an oscillatory
contribution to the diffusive current. The Halevi model thus captures a number
of relevant features beyond the standard hydrodynamic model. Contrary to other
extensions of the standard hydrodynamic model, its use in time-domain Maxwell
solvers is straightforward -- especially due its affinity to a class of
descriptions that allow for a clear distinction between bulk and surface

in the formation of second-generation (SG) stars in globular clusters (GC). Our
simulations follow the SG formation in a first-generation (FG) internally
rotating GC; SG stars form out of FG asymptotic giant branch (AGB) ejecta and
external pristine gas accreted by the system. We have explored two different
initial rotational velocity profiles for the FG cluster and two different
inclinations of the rotational axis with respect to the direction of motion of
the external infalling gas, whose density has also been varied. For a low
(10^-24 g cm^-3) external gas density, a disk of SG helium-enhanced stars is
formed. The SG is characterized by distinct chemo-dynamical phase space
patterns: it shows a more rapid rotation than the FG with the helium-enhanced
SG subsystem rotating more rapidly than the moderate helium-enhanced one. In
models with high external gas density (10^-23 g cm^-3), the inner SG disc is
disrupted by the early arrival of external gas and only a small fraction of
highly enhanced helium stars preserves the rotation acquired at birth.
Variations in the inclination angle between the rotation axis and the direction
of the infalling gas and the velocity profile can slightly alter the extent of
the stellar disc and the rotational amplitude. No significant variation has
been found in the timespan of our simulations when changing the inclination
angle between the rotation axis and the direction of the infalling gas, while
different velocity profiles can slightly alter the extent of the stellar disc
and the rotational amplitude. The results of our simulations illustrate the
complex link between dynamical and chemical properties of multiple populations
and provide new elements for the interpretation of observational studies and
future investigations of the dynamics of multiple-population GCs.

According
to the standard trust game, an investor decides whether to keep or transfer a
certain portion of initial stake to a trustee. In the latter case, the stake is
enhanced to signal the value of trust. The trustee then chooses how much to
return to the investor. We here distinguish two types of investors and two
types of trustees who can learn from each other. While a trustee can be
trustworthy or untrustworthy, an investor could be normal or punishing one. The
latter strategy punishes both untrustworthy trustees and normal investors who
are reluctant to control misbehaving trustees. Importantly, we assume a
hierarchical population where the portion of investors and trustees is fixed.
By means of replicator equation approach, we study the $N$-player trust game
and calculate the level of trust and trustworthiness. We find that the
introduction of punishment can induce a stable coexistence state between
punishing investors and trustworthy trustees. Furthermore, an intermediate
fraction of investors can better promote the evolution of trust when the
punishment intensity is low. For more intensive punishment, however, a higher
fraction of investors can be more efficient to elevate the trust level. In
addition, we reveal that appropriate increase of the punishment intensity can
enlarge the attraction domain of the coexistence state.

result of the increase in viscosity that often occurs at high concentrations.
Here, we establish a link between the microscopic molecular details and the
resulting properties of an antibody solution through the characterization of
clusters, which arise in the presence of self-associating antibodies. In
particular, we find that experimental small-angle X-ray scattering data can be
interpreted by means of analytical models previously exploited for the study of
polymeric and colloidal objects, based on the presence of such clusters. The
latter are determined by theoretical calculations and supported by computer
simulations of a coarse-grained minimal model, in which antibodies are treated
as Y-shaped colloidal molecules and attractive domains are designed as patches.
Using the theoretically-predicted cluster size distributions, we are able to
describe the experimental structure factors over a wide range of concentration
and salt conditions. We thus provide microscopic evidence for the
well-established fact that the concentration-dependent increase in viscosity is
originated by the presence of clusters. Our findings bring new insights on the
self-assembly of monoclonal antibodies, which can be exploited for guiding the

far, astrobiological studies show that one of the most critical components for

dissolve and hence transport other substances makes this constituent a key
piece in the development of life. As a consequence, looking for life as we know

K-dwarfs are the quietest in terms of oscillations, and granulation noise.
Despite this, there is a dearth of planets in the habitable zone of K-dwarfs
due to a lack of observing programs devoted to this parameter space. In
response to a call for Legacy Programs of the Calar Alto observatory, we have
started the first dedicated and systematic search for habitable planets around
K-dwarfs, the K-dwarfs Orbited By habitable Exoplanets (KOBE). This survey is
monitoring the radial velocity of 50 carefully pre-selected K-dwarfs with the
CARMENES instrument along 5 semesters with an average of 90 data points per
target. Based on planet occurrence rates convolved with our detectability
limits, we expect to find $1.68\pm 0.25$ planets per star in the KOBE sample
and in half of the sample we expect to find one of those planets within the
habitable zone. In this paper, we describe the project motivation, goals and
target selection and preliminary stellar characterization.

decades, functional heterointerfaces composed of nitrides are seldomly explored
due to the difficulty in synthesizing high-quality and correct composition
nitride films. Here we report the fabrication of single-crystalline
ferromagnetic Fe3N thin films with precisely controlled thickness. As film
thickness decreasing, the magnetization deteriorates dramatically, and
electronic state transits from metallic to insulating. Strikingly, the
high-temperature ferromagnetism maintains in a Fe3N layer with a thickness down
to 2 u. c. (~ 8 {\AA}). The magnetoresistance exhibits a strong in-plane
anisotropy and meanwhile the anomalous Hall resistance reserves its sign when
Fe3N layer thickness exceeds 5 u. c. Furthermore, we observe a sizable exchange
bias at the interfaces between a ferromagnetic Fe3N and an antiferromagnetic
CrN. The exchange bias field and saturation moment strongly depend on the
controllable bending curvature using cylinder diameter engineering (CDE)
technique, implying the tunable magnetic states under lattice deformation. This

effective hybrid system that provides proper customer service to clients is
promising yet challenging. The hybrid system decreases the customers'
frustration when bots are unable to provide appropriate service and increases
their satisfaction when they prefer to interact with human operators.
Furthermore, we show that it is possible to decrease the cost and efforts of
building and maintaining such virtual agents by enabling the virtual agent to
incrementally learn from the human operators. We employ queuing theory to
identify the key parameters that govern the behavior and efficiency of such
hybrid systems and determine the main parameters that should be optimized in

  Framework for Efficient Device Model Generalization",,,,,"cs.DC cs.AI cs.CV cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Device Model Generalization (DMG) is a practical yet under-investigated
research topic for on-device machine learning applications. It aims to improve
the generalization ability of pre-trained models when deployed on
resource-constrained devices, such as improving the performance of pre-trained
cloud models on smart mobiles. While quite a lot of works have investigated the
data distribution shift across clouds and devices, most of them focus on model
fine-tuning on personalized data for individual devices to facilitate DMG.
Despite their promising, these approaches require on-device re-training, which
is practically infeasible due to the overfitting problem and high time delay
when performing gradient calculation on real-time data. In this paper, we argue
that the computational cost brought by fine-tuning can be rather unnecessary.
We consequently present a novel perspective to improving DMG without increasing
computational cost, i.e., device-specific parameter generation which directly
maps data distribution to parameters. Specifically, we propose an efficient
Device-cloUd collaborative parametErs generaTion framework DUET. DUET is
deployed on a powerful cloud server that only requires the low cost of
forwarding propagation and low time delay of data transmission between the
device and the cloud. By doing so, DUET can rehearse the device-specific model
weight realizations conditioned on the personalized real-time data for an
individual device. Importantly, our DUET elegantly connects the cloud and
device as a 'duet' collaboration, frees the DMG from fine-tuning, and enables a
faster and more accurate DMG paradigm. We conduct an extensive experimental
study of DUET on three public datasets, and the experimental results confirm
our framework's effectiveness and generalisability for different DMG tasks.

opened up possibilities for designing structures against failure. A special
case, called interfacial fracture or delamination, can occur in loaded
composite structures where two or more materials are bonded together at
comparatively weak interfaces. Due to the potential crack growth along these
interfaces, the structural problem suffers from snap-back/snap-through
instabilities and bifurcations with respect to the model parameters, leading to
noisy and discontinuous responses. For such a case, the design optimization
problem for a selected quantity of interest is ill-posed, since small
variations in the design parameters can lead to large jumps in the structural
response. To this end, this paper presents a stochastic optimization approach
to maximize delamination resistance that is less sensitive to small
perturbations of the design and thereby leads to a robust solution. To overcome
the intractability of Monte Carlo methods for estimating the expected value of
the expensive-to-evaluate response function, a global, piecewise-constant
surrogate is constructed based on nearest-neighbor interpolation that is
iteratively refined during the optimization run. We found that by taking a
large stochastic region at the beginning of the optimization and gradually
reducing it to the desired one can help overcome poor local optima. Our results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using an example of
shape optimization of hard inclusions embedded in a double-cantilever beam,
which significantly enhances delamination resistance.

show complicated variations and reversals of Faraday rotation measures (RMs),
indicating that the sources of these FRBs are embedded in a dynamically
magnetized environment. One possible scenario is that repeating FRBs are
generated by pulsars in binary systems, especially containing a high-mass
companion with strong stellar outflows. Here, we study the RM variations caused
by stellar winds, and a possible stellar disc. If the magnetic field is radial
in the stellar wind, RM will not reverse except if the magnetic axis
inclination angle is close to $90 ^\circ$. For the toroidal magnetic field in
the wind, RM will reverse at the super conjunction. For the case of the
toroidal field in the disc, the RM variations may have a multimodal and
multiple reversal profile because the radio signals travel through different
components of the disc during periastron passage. We also apply this model to
FRB 20180916B. By assuming its 16.35-day period is from a slowly rotating or
freely precessing magnetar, we find that the secular RM variation can be
explained by the periastron passage of a magnetar in a massive binary system.
In addition, the clumps in the stellar wind and disc can cause short time-scale
($< 1$ day) variations or reversals of RM. Therefore, long-term monitoring of
RM variations can reveal the environments of repeating FRBs.

vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which motivates the development of backdoor
attacks detection. Most detection methods are designed to verify whether a
model is infected with presumed types of backdoor attacks, yet the adversary is
likely to generate diverse backdoor attacks in practice that are unforeseen to
defenders, which challenge current detection strategies. In this paper, we
focus on this more challenging scenario and propose a universal backdoor
attacks detection method named Adaptive Adversarial Probe (A2P). Specifically,
we posit that the challenge of universal backdoor attacks detection lies in the
fact that different backdoor attacks often exhibit diverse characteristics in
trigger patterns (i.e., sizes and transparencies). Therefore, our A2P adopts a
global-to-local probing framework, which adversarially probes images with
adaptive regions/budgets to fit various backdoor triggers of different
sizes/transparencies. Regarding the probing region, we propose the
attention-guided region generation strategy that generates region proposals
with different sizes/locations based on the attention of the target model,
since trigger regions often manifest higher model activation. Considering the
attack budget, we introduce the box-to-sparsity scheduling that iteratively
increases the perturbation budget from box to sparse constraint, so that we
could better activate different latent backdoors with different transparencies.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, Tiny-ImageNet)
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by large

the energy released from radioactive decays of r-process nuclei, and radiation
transport is performed using grey opacities given as functions of the electron

the emission along polar lines of sight to be up to a factor of ~2 brighter

further show that the model can be self-distilled for additional performance

paper, we present a causal method that will enable robots to predict when
errors are likely to occur and prevent them from happening by executing a
corrective action. First, we propose a causal-based method to detect the
cause-effect relationships between task executions and their consequences by
learning a causal Bayesian network (BN). The obtained model is transferred from
simulated data to real scenarios to demonstrate the robustness and
generalization of the obtained models. Based on the causal BN, the robot can
predict if and why the executed action will succeed or not in its current
state. Then, we introduce a novel method that finds the closest state
alternatives through a contrastive Breadth-First-Search if the current action
was predicted to fail. We evaluate our approach for the problem of stacking
cubes in two cases; a) single stacks (stacking one cube) and; b) multiple
stacks (stacking three cubes). In the single-stack case, our method was able to
reduce the error rate by 97%. We also show that our approach can scale to
capture multiple actions in one model, allowing to measure timely shifted
action effects, such as the impact of an imprecise stack of the first cube on
the stacking success of the third cube. For these complex situations, our model
was able to prevent around 75% of the stacking errors, even for the challenging
multiple-stack scenario. Thus, demonstrating that our method is able to
explain, predict, and prevent execution failures, which even scales to complex
scenarios that require an understanding of how the action history impacts
future actions.

  Learning","Accepted copy, to be published in ISAMR 2022",,,,"cs.HC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cybersickness can be characterized by nausea, vertigo, headache, eye strain,
and other discomforts when using virtual reality (VR) systems. The previously
reported machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms for detecting
(classification) and predicting (regression) VR cybersickness use black-box
models; thus, they lack explainability. Moreover, VR sensors generate a massive
amount of data, resulting in complex and large models. Therefore, having
inherent explainability in cybersickness detection models can significantly
improve the model's trustworthiness and provide insight into why and how the
ML/DL model arrived at a specific decision. To address this issue, we present
three explainable machine learning (xML) models to detect and predict
cybersickness: 1) explainable boosting machine (EBM), 2) decision tree (DT),
and 3) logistic regression (LR). We evaluate xML-based models with publicly
available physiological and gameplay datasets for cybersickness. The results
show that the EBM can detect cybersickness with an accuracy of 99.75% and
94.10% for the physiological and gameplay datasets, respectively. On the other
hand, while predicting the cybersickness, EBM resulted in a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 0.071 for the physiological dataset and 0.27 for the gameplay
dataset. Furthermore, the EBM-based global explanation reveals exposure length,
rotation, and acceleration as key features causing cybersickness in the
gameplay dataset. In contrast, galvanic skin responses and heart rate are most
significant in the physiological dataset. Our results also suggest that
EBM-based local explanation can identify cybersickness-causing factors for
individual samples. We believe the proposed xML-based cybersickness detection
method can help future researchers understand, analyze, and design simpler
cybersickness detection and reduction models.

environment has made energy efficient ML an emerging area of research. However,
most of the attention stays focused on the model creation and the training and
inferencing phase. Data oriented stages like preprocessing, cleaning and
exploratory analysis form a critical part of the machine learning workflow.
However, the energy efficiency of these stages have gained little attention
from the researchers. Aim: Our study aims to explore the energy consumption of
different dataframe processing libraries as a first step towards studying the
energy efficiency of the data oriented stages of the machine learning pipeline.
Method: We measure the energy consumption of 3 popular libraries used to work
with dataframes, namely Pandas, Vaex and Dask for 21 different operations
grouped under 4 categories on 2 datasets. Results: The results of our analysis
show that for a given dataframe processing operation, the choice of library can
indeed influence the energy consumption with some libraries consuming 202 times
lesser energy over others. Conclusion: The results of our study indicates that
there is a potential for optimizing the energy consumption of the data oriented

performs better under metrics of precision, recall and F1-score, especially for

under-constrained given sparse views, resulting in significant degradation of

embedded in multi-view inputs to handle the unconstrained geometry issue in
NeRF. Specifically, it tackles the texture and non-texture regions
respectively: a patch-based multi-view consistent photometric loss is proposed
to constrain the geometry of textured regions; for non-textured ones, we
explicitly restrict them to be 3D consistent planes. Through the dense
self-supervised depth constraints, our method improves both the geometry and
the view synthesis performance of NeRF without any additional training on

that StructNeRF surpasses state-of-the-art methods for indoor scenes with

included for the synthesis activity reached from the search strategy alongside
the inclusion criteria in order to answer to two main research questions. The
study's findings reveal patterns, relationships, networks, and trends in
applying artificial intelligence in palm tree detection over the last decade.
Despite the good results in most of the studies, the effective and efficient

treatment of electromagnetic and strong corrections for semi-leptonic decays.
Electromagnetic corrections require the renormalization of a semileptonic
four-fermion operator. In this work we calculate the
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha\alpha_s)$ perturbative scheme conversion between the
$\bar{\rm MS}$ scheme and several momentum-space subtraction schemes, which can
also be implemented on the lattice. We consider schemes defined by MOM and SMOM
kinematics and emphasize the importance of the choice of projector for each
scheme. The conventional projector, that has been used in the literature for
MOM kinematics, generates QCD corrections to the conversion factor that do not
vanish for $\alpha=0$ and which generate an artificial dependence on the
lattice matching scale that would only disappear after summing all orders of
perturbation theory. This can be traced to the violation of a Ward identity
that holds in tha $\alpha =0$ limit. We show how to remedy this by judicious
choices of projector, and prove that the Wilson coefficients in those schemes
are free from pure QCD contributions. The resulting Wilson coefficients (and
operator matrix elements) have greatly reduced scale dependence. Our choice of
the $\bar{\rm MS}$ scheme over the traditional $W$-mass scheme is motivated by
the fact that, besides being more tractable at higher orders, unlike the latter
it allows for a transparent separation of scales. We exploit this to obtain
renormalization-group-improved leading-log and next-to-leading-log strong
corrections to the electromagnetic contributions and study the (QED-induced)
dependence on the lattice matching scale.

nonlinear oscillator defined on a radially symmetric space with non-constant
negative curvature. This oscillator can be interpreted as a smooth
(super)integrable deformation of the usual $N$-dimensional harmonic oscillator
in terms of a non-negative parameter $\lambda$ which is directly related to the
curvature of the underlying space. In this paper, a detailed study of the
Shannon information entropy for the quantum version of the Darboux III
oscillator is presented, and the interplay between entropy and curvature is
analysed. In particular, analytical results for the Shannon entropy in the
position space can be found in the $N$-dimensional case, and the known results
for the quantum states of the $N$-dimensional harmonic oscillator are recovered
in the limit of vanishing curvature $\lambda \to 0$. However, the Fourier
transform of the Darboux III wave functions cannot be computed in exact form,
thus preventing the analytical study of the information entropy in momentum
space. Nevertheless, we have computed the latter numerically both in the one
and three-dimensional cases and we have found that by increasing the absolute
value of the negative curvature (through a larger $\lambda$ parameter) the
information entropy in position space increases, while in momentum space it
becomes smaller. This result is indeed consistent with the spreading properties
of the wave functions of this quantum nonlinear oscillator, which are
explicitly shown. The sum of the entropies in position and momentum spaces has
been also analysed in terms of the curvature: for all excited states such total
entropy decreases with $\lambda$, but for the ground state the total entropy is
minimised when $\lambda$ vanishes, and the corresponding uncertainty relation
is always fulfilled.

Specifically, we apply convolutional pooling and re-attention to enrich the

multi-channel time series data with varying lengths, which we refer to as the
alignment problem, for downstream machine learning. The misalignment of
multi-channel time series data may occur for a variety of reasons, such as
missing data, varying sampling rates, or inconsistent collection times. We
consider multi-channel time series data collected from the MIT SuperCloud High
Performance Computing (HPC) center, where different job start times and varying
run times of HPC jobs result in misaligned data. This misalignment makes it
challenging to build AI/ML approaches for tasks such as compute workload
classification. Building on previous supervised classification work with the
MIT SuperCloud Dataset, we address the alignment problem via three broad, low
overhead approaches: sampling a fixed subset from a full time series,
performing summary statistics on a full time series, and sampling a subset of
coefficients from time series mapped to the frequency domain. Our best
performing models achieve a classification accuracy greater than 95%,
outperforming previous approaches to multi-channel time series classification
with the MIT SuperCloud Dataset by 5%. These results indicate our low overhead
approaches to solving the alignment problem, in conjunction with standard
machine learning techniques, are able to achieve high levels of classification
accuracy, and serve as a baseline for future approaches to addressing the
alignment problem, such as kernel methods.

language processing task that aims to make text understandable to everyone by
replacing complex vocabulary and expressions with simpler ones, while
preserving the original meaning. It has attracted considerable attention in the
last 20 years, and fully automatic lexical simplification systems have been
proposed for various languages. The main obstacle for the progress of the field
is the absence of high-quality datasets for building and evaluating lexical
simplification systems. We present a new benchmark dataset for lexical
simplification in English, Spanish, and (Brazilian) Portuguese, and provide
details about data selection and annotation procedures. This is the first
dataset that offers a direct comparison of lexical simplification systems for
three languages. To showcase the usability of the dataset, we adapt two
state-of-the-art lexical simplification systems with differing architectures
(neural vs.\ non-neural) to all three languages (English, Spanish, and
Brazilian Portuguese) and evaluate their performances on our new dataset. For a
fairer comparison, we use several evaluation measures which capture varied

We find a state-of-the-art neural lexical simplification system outperforms a
state-of-the-art non-neural lexical simplification system in all three

simplification systems perform significantly better for English than for

provide a window on the composition and thermal structure of the planetary
atmospheres. For example, the photometric observations of secondary eclipses

indicator of the presence of clouds in the atmosphere. In this work we aim to
measure the $A_g$ in the optical domain of WASP-43b, a moderately irradiated
giant planet with an equilibrium temperature of $\sim$1400~K. To this purpose,
we analyze the secondary eclipse light curves collected by CHEOPS, together
with TESS observations of the system and the publicly available photometry
obtained with HST WFC3/UVIS. We also analyze the archival infrared observations
of the eclipses and retrieve the thermal emission spectrum of the planet. By
extrapolating the thermal spectrum to the optical bands, we correct the optical
eclipses for thermal emission and derive the optical $A_g$. The fit of the
optical data leads to a marginal detection of the phase curve signal,
characterized by an amplitude of $160\pm60$~ppm and 80$^{+60}_{-50}$~ppm in the
CHEOPS and TESS passband respectively, with an eastward phase shift of
$\sim50^\circ$ (1.5$\sigma$ detection). The analysis of the infrared data
suggests a non-inverted thermal profile and solar-like metallicity. The
combination of optical and infrared analysis allows us to derive an upper limit
for the optical albedo of $A_g<0.087$ with a confidence of 99.9\%. Our analysis
of the atmosphere of WASP-43b places this planet in the sample of irradiated
hot Jupiters, with monotonic temperature-pressure profile and no indication of

and optics, is a general phenomenon characterized by an all-or-none response of
a system to an external perturbation. When subject to delayed feedback,
excitable systems can sustain multistable pulsing regimes, which are either
regular or irregular time sequences of pulses reappearing every delay time.
Here, we investigate an excitable microlaser subject to delayed optical
feedback and study the emergence of complex pulsing dynamics, including
periodic, quasiperiodic and irregular pulsing regimes. This work is motivated
by experimental observations showing these different types of pulsing dynamics.
A suitable mathematical model, written as a system of delay differential
equations, is investigated through an in-depth bifurcation analysis. We
demonstrate that resonance tongues play a key role in the emergence of complex
dynamics, including non-equidistant periodic pulsing solutions and chaotic
pulsing. The structure of resonance tongues is shown to depend very sensitively
on the pump parameter. Successive saddle transitions of bounding saddle-node
bifurcations constitute a merging process that results in unexpectedly large
locking regions, which subsequently disconnect from the relevant torus
bifurcation curve; the existence of such unconnected regions of periodic
pulsing is in excellent agreement with experimental observations. As we show,
the transition to unconnected resonance regions is due to a general mechanism:
the interaction of resonance tongues locally at an extremum of the rotation
number on a torus bifurcation curve. We present and illustrate the two generic
cases of disconnecting and of disappearing resonance tongues. Moreover, we show
how a maximum and a minimum of the rotation number appears naturally when two
torus bifurcation curves undergo a saddle transition (where they connect
differently).

However, it has been widely acknowledged that screen content images (SCIs),
which are typically computer generated, do not hold such statistics. Here we
make the first attempt to learn the statistics of SCIs, based upon which the
quality of SCIs can be effectively determined. The underlying mechanism of the
proposed approach is based upon the wild assumption that the SCIs, which are
not physically acquired, still obey certain statistics that could be understood
in a learning fashion. We empirically show that the statistics deviation could
be effectively leveraged in quality assessment, and the proposed method is
superior when evaluated in different settings. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate the Deep Feature Statistics based SCI Quality Assessment (DFSS-IQA)

shows a high generalization capability in the cross-dataset settings. The

tasks is trending and drawing extensive attention both from industry and
academia. Conventional approaches for most autonomous driving algorithms
perform detection, segmentation, tracking, etc., in a front or perspective
view. As sensor configurations get more complex, integrating multi-source
information from different sensors and representing features in a unified view
come of vital importance. BEV perception inherits several advantages, as
representing surrounding scenes in BEV is intuitive and fusion-friendly; and
representing objects in BEV is most desirable for subsequent modules as in
planning and/or control. The core problems for BEV perception lie in (a) how to
reconstruct the lost 3D information via view transformation from perspective
view to BEV; (b) how to acquire ground truth annotations in BEV grid; (c) how
to formulate the pipeline to incorporate features from different sources and
views; and (d) how to adapt and generalize algorithms as sensor configurations
vary across different scenarios. In this survey, we review the most recent work
on BEV perception and provide an in-depth analysis of different solutions.
Moreover, several systematic designs of BEV approach from the industry are
depicted as well. Furthermore, we introduce a full suite of practical guidebook
to improve the performance of BEV perception tasks, including camera, LiDAR and
fusion inputs. At last, we point out the future research directions in this

the jet body, exhibits exciting self-organization phenomena that resemble the
self-organized patterns of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) filaments.
Similarly, as in DBD, the filaments are surrounded by an inhibition zone that
does not allow two filaments to come closer to each other. With fast camera
imaging, we observed the filamentary character of the discharge in all the
studied gas feeds (Ar, Ar/N$_2$, and Ar/O$_2$). Still, the visual appearance of
the filaments in the plasma and their interaction with a dielectric surface
depended significantly on the gas feed. As the breakdown voltage in pure Ar is
relatively low compared to the applied one, new filaments form frequently. Such
newly created filaments disrupted the characteristic inter-filament distance,
forcing the system to rearrange. The frequent ignition and decay processes in
Ar led to short filament lifetimes (0.020-0.035 s) and their high jitter speed
(0.9-1.7 m/s), as determined with an image processing custom code based on
Gwyddion libraries. The number of filaments was lower in the Ar/O$_2$ and
Ar/N$_2$ mixtures. It was attributed to a loss of energy in the excitation of
rotational and vibrational levels and oxygen electronegativity. Since the
probability of low-current side discharges transitioning into the full plasma
filaments was limited in the gas mixtures, the self-organized pattern was
seldom disrupted, leading to lesser movement and longer lifetimes. Unlike in Ar
or Ar/O$_2$, the constricted filaments in Ar/N$_2$ were surrounded by diffuse
plasma plumes, likely connected to the presence of long-lived nitrogen species.
We demonstrated in the polypropylene treatment that the self-organization
phenomena affected the treatment uniformity.

fluctuation of the gravitational radiation. We perform our derivation of the
full analytical solution of the density contrast for waves entering the horizon

depending on the main contributor to the perturbed energy density of the
Universe. By comparing the density contrast of cold dark matter and radiation
-- sourced by linear gravitational waves only -- we conclude that the former
overcomes the latter at some time in the radiation era, a behaviour analogous
to their linear counterpart. Then we conclude by discussing the case of density
perturbations produced by GWs entering the Hubble radius during the matter era
as well as their evolution in the late dark-energy dominated phase.

challenge of reducing the thermal budget of processes to be applied everywhere

We present an approach in this direction where the quantum computation is
supplemented by a classical result. While the presence of the supplementary
classical information helps alone, taking advantage of its anticipation also
leads to a new type of quantum measurements, which we call anticipative.
Anticipative quantum measurements lead to improved success rate over cases

measurement the combination of the results from classical and quantum
computations happens only in the end, without the need for feedback from the

computations in parallel. We demonstrate the method with an experiment using an

an engine which will work in a complete cycle, and produces no effect except
the raising of a weight and cooling of a heat reservoir."" While the Second Law
is considered as one of the most robust laws of Nature, it is still challenging
how to interpret it in a fully quantum domain. Here we unpack the true meaning
of the ""cyclicity"" and formulate the Second Law for a generic quantum battery
via its asymptotic properties of a charging process rather than in terms of a
single cycle. As a paradigm, we propose a machine consisting of a battery that
repeatedly interacts with identically prepared systems. We then propose the
Second Law in the form: The ergotropy of the battery may increase indefinitely
if and only if systems are in a non-passive state. One of the most interesting
features of this new formulation is the appearance of the passive states that
naturally generalize the notion of the heat bath. In this paper, we provide a
handful of results that supports this formulation for diagonal systems.
Interestingly, our methodology meets a well-known theory of Markov chains,
according to which we classify the general charging processes based on the
passivity/non-passivity of charging systems. In particular, the adopted
mathematics allows us to distinguish a subtle asymptotic difference between the
indefinite increase of the battery's energy (induced by the maximally mixed
states) and of ergotropy (induced by the non-passive states) in terms of the
so-called null-recurrent versus transient Markov chains.

understood and integrable, which provides a convenient benchmark for the

of the SG model arbitrary well up to the free Fermion point [coupling
$\beta=\sqrt{4\pi}$ in equal-time quantization convention, or $b=1/\sqrt{2}$ in
CFT convention], where the ground energy collapses to $-\infty$, and some
renormalized ansatz would be needed. The ShG model, while integrable, is less
understood and its strong coupling regime $\beta \approx 1$ is subject to some
controversy. RCMPS also fit the ground state of the ShG model up to
approximately $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, after which their predictions start to deviate
substantially from the ""exact"" results. This is more puzzling as nothing is
expected to happen physically for the ShG model at that point (eg, the ground
energy density does not diverge). Either the ""exact"" ShG results are not exact
(the analytic continuation of the SG Bethe Ansatz solution is unwarranted), or,
more likely, the physical structure of the ShG ground state changes in such a

But structure prediction methods typically render only a small fraction of high
symmetry structures. Especially for large crystalline unit cells there are many
low energy defect structures. For this reason methods have been developed where
either preferentially high symmetry structures are used as input or where the
whole structural search is done within a certain symmetry group. In both cases
it is necessary to specify the correct symmetry group beforehand. However it
can in general not be predicted which symmetry group is the correct one leading
to the ground state. For this reason we introduce a potential energy biasing
scheme that favors symmetry and where it is not necessary to specify any
symmetry group beforehand. On this biased potential energy surface, high
symmetry structures will be found much faster than on an unbiased surface and
independently of the symmetry group to which they belong. For our two test
cases, a $C_{60}$ fullerene and bulk silicon carbide, we get a speedups of 25
and 63. In our data we also find a clear correlation between the similarity of
the atomic environments and the energy. In low energy structures all the atoms
of a species tend to have similar environments.

predefined Industry Classification System (ICS), is fundamental to a large
number of critical business practices, ranging from operations and strategic
decision making by firms to economic analyses by government agencies. Three
types of expert knowledge are essential to effective industry assignment:
definition-based knowledge (i.e., expert definitions of each industry),
structure-based knowledge (i.e., structural relationships among industries as
specified in an ICS), and assignment-based knowledge (i.e., prior firm-industry
assignments performed by domain experts). Existing industry assignment methods
utilize only assignment-based knowledge to learn a model that classifies
unassigned firms to industries, and overlook definition-based and
structure-based knowledge. Moreover, these methods only consider which industry
a firm has been assigned to, but ignore the time-specificity of
assignment-based knowledge, i.e., when the assignment occurs. To address the
limitations of existing methods, we propose a novel deep learning-based method
that not only seamlessly integrates the three types of knowledge for industry
assignment but also takes the time-specificity of assignment-based knowledge
into account. Methodologically, our method features two innovations: dynamic
industry representation and hierarchical assignment. The former represents an
industry as a sequence of time-specific vectors by integrating the three types
of knowledge through our proposed temporal and spatial aggregation mechanisms.
The latter takes industry and firm representations as inputs, computes the
probability of assigning a firm to different industries, and assigns the firm
to the industry with the highest probability.

We follow up with the analysis of the attribute-based zero-shot learning

released LAION400M data corpus as well as the publicly available pretrained

of recognizing class labels, whenever they are present in the text, and a
significantly lower performing capability of attribute-based zeroshot learning
is only observed when class labels are not used; (iii) the number of the

attracted the interest of researchers for decades. One way to handle
unpredictability is to characterise the search spaces and take actions
accordingly. A well-characterised search space can assist in mapping the
problem states to a set of operators for generating new problem states. In this
paper, a landscape analysis-based set of features has been analysed using the
most renown machine learning approaches to determine the optimal feature set.
However, in order to deal with problem complexity and induce commonality for
transferring experience across domains, the selection of the most
representative features remains crucial. The proposed approach analyses the
predictivity of a set of features in order to determine the best
categorization.

  homology",,,,,"math.AT cs.LG cs.MS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper aims to discuss a method of quantifying the 'shape' of data, via a
methodology called topological data analysis. The main tool within topological
data analysis is persistent homology; this is a means of measuring the shape of
data, from the homology of a simplicial complex, calculated over a range of
values. The required background theory and a method of computing persistent
homology is presented here, with applications specific to structural health
monitoring. These results allow for topological inference and the ability to
deduce features in higher-dimensional data, that might otherwise be overlooked.
  A simplicial complex is constructed for data for a given distance parameter.
This complex encodes information about the local proximity of data points. A
singular homology value can be calculated from this simplicial complex.
Extending this idea, the distance parameter is given for a range of values, and
the homology is calculated over this range. The persistent homology is a
representation of how the homological features of the data persist over this
interval. The result is characteristic to the data. A method that allows for
the comparison of the persistent homology for different data sets is also
discussed.

WASP-103b, and TrES-3b. The observations were conducted with meter-sized
telescopes in the blue optical broadband filters Johnson B and Johnson V. We do
not detect a photometric dimming at the moment of the eclipse, and derive a
best-fit eclipse depth by an injection-recovery test. These depth values are
then used to infer low geometric albedos ranging from zero to 0.18 with an
uncertainty of 0.12 or better in most cases. This work illustrates the
potential of ground-based telescopes to provide wavelength-resolved reflection
properties of selected exoplanets even at short optical wavelengths, which
otherwise are only accessible by the Hubble Space Telescope.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce the \emph{temporal graphlet kernel} for classifying
dissemination processes in labeled temporal graphs. Such dissemination
processes can be spreading (fake) news, infectious diseases, or computer
viruses in dynamic networks. The networks are modeled as labeled temporal
graphs, in which the edges exist at specific points in time, and node labels
change over time. The classification problem asks to discriminate dissemination
processes of different origins or parameters, e.g., infectious diseases with
different infection probabilities. Our new kernel represents labeled temporal
graphs in the feature space of temporal graphlets, i.e., small subgraphs
distinguished by their structure, time-dependent node labels, and chronological
order of edges. We introduce variants of our kernel based on classes of
graphlets that are efficiently countable. For the case of temporal wedges, we
propose a highly efficient approximative kernel with low error in expectation.
We show that our kernels are faster to compute and provide better accuracy than
state-of-the-art methods.

which is a combined word-emoji embedding using the word2vec model from the
Genism library in Python. We trained emojiSpace on a corpus of more than 4
billion tweets and evaluated it by implementing sentiment analysis on a Twitter

(RF) and linear support vector machine (SVM). For evaluation, we compared
emojiSpace performance with two other pre-trained embeddings and demonstrated
that emojiSpace outperforms both.

  Effort Estimation",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimating software effort has been a largely unsolved problem for decades.
One of the main reasons that hinders building accurate estimation models is the
often heterogeneous nature of software data with a complex structure.
Typically, building effort estimation models from local data tends to be more
accurate than using the entire data. Previous studies have focused on the use
of clustering techniques and decision trees to generate local and coherent data
that can help in building local prediction models. However, these approaches
may fall short in some aspect due to limitations in finding optimal clusters
and processing noisy data. In this paper we used a more sophisticated locality
approach that can mitigate these shortcomings that is Locally Weighted
Regression (LWR). This method provides an efficient solution to learn from
local data by building an estimation model that combines multiple local
regression models in k-nearest-neighbor based model. The main factor affecting
the accuracy of this method is the choice of the kernel function used to derive
the weights for local regression models. This paper investigates the effects of
choosing different kernels on the performance of Locally Weighted Regression of
a software effort estimation problem. After comprehensive experiments with 7
datasets, 10 kernels, 3 polynomial degrees and 4 bandwidth values with a total
of 840 Locally Weighted Regression variants, we found that: 1) Uniform kernel
functions cannot outperform non-uniform kernel functions, and 2) kernel type,
polynomial degrees and bandwidth parameters have no specific effect on the
estimation accuracy.

cointegration, for the natural frequencies of the Z24 Bridge. The second
natural frequency is known to be nonlinear in temperature, and this will serve
as the main focal point of this work. Cointegration is a method of normalising
time series data with respect to one another - often strongly-correlated time
series. Cointegration is used in this paper to remove effects from
Environmental and Operational Variations, by cointegrating the first four
natural frequencies for the Z24 Bridge data. The temperature effects on the
natural frequency data are clearly visible within the data, and it is
desirable, for the purposes of structural health monitoring, that these effects
are removed. The univariate time series are embedded in higher-dimensional
space, such that interesting topologies are formed. Topological data analysis
is used to analyse the raw time series, and the cointegrated equivalents. A
standard topological data analysis pipeline is enacted, where simplicial
complexes are constructed from the embedded point clouds. Topological
properties are then calculated from the simplicial complexes; such as the
persistent homology. The persistent homology is then analysed, to determine the
topological structure of all the time series.
