  maps",,,,,"math.DS math-ph math.MP math.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Faure and Tsujii have recently proposed a novel quantization procedure, named
natural quantization, for smooth symplectic Anosov diffeomorphisms. Their
method starts with prequantization, which is also the first step of geometric
quantization as proposed by Kostant-Souriau-Kirillov, and then relies on the
Ruelle-Pollicott spectrum of the prequantum transfer operator, which they show
to have a particular band structure. The appeal of this new quantization scheme
resides in its naturalness: the quantum behavior appears dynamically in the
classical correlation functions of the prequantum transfer operator. In this
paper, we explicitly work out the case of cat maps on the $2n$-dimensional
torus, showing in particular that the outcome is equivalent to that of the
usual Weyl quantization. We also provide a concrete construction of all the
prequantum cat maps.

  problems with net present value objective",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Resource-constrained project scheduling problems (RCPSP) are at the heart of
many production planning problems across a plethora of applications. Although
the problem has been studied since the early 1960s, most developments and test
instances are limited to problems with less than 300 jobs, far from the
thousands present in real-life scenarios. Furthermore, the RCPSP with
discounted cost (DC) is critical in many of these settings, which require
decision makers to evaluate the net present value of the finished tasks, but
the non-linear cost function makes the problem harder to solve or analyze.
  In this work, we propose a novel approximation algorithm for the RCPSP-DC.
Our main contribution is that, through the use of geometrically increasing
intervals, we can construct an approximation algorithm, keeping track of
precedence constraints, usage of multiple resources, and time requirements. To
our knowledge, this is the first approximation algorithm for this problem.
Finally, through experimental analysis over real instances, we report the
empirical performance of our approach, showing that our technique allows us to
solve sizeable underground mining problems within reasonable time frames and
gaps much smaller than the theoretically computed ones.

because of their fast inference in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Language
model (LM) integration approaches such as shallow fusion and rescoring can
improve the recognition accuracy of CTC-based ASR by taking advantage of the
knowledge in text corpora. However, they significantly slow down the inference
of CTC. In this study, we propose to distill the knowledge of BERT for
CTC-based ASR, extending our previous study for attention-based ASR. CTC-based
ASR learns the knowledge of BERT during training and does not use BERT during
testing, which maintains the fast inference of CTC. Different from
attention-based models, CTC-based models make frame-level predictions, so they
need to be aligned with token-level predictions of BERT for distillation. We
propose to obtain alignments by calculating the most plausible CTC paths.
Experimental evaluations on the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) and

These constraints drastically reduce the volume of parameter space that any

signal denoising on graphs via a data-driven wavelet tight frame methodology.
This adaptive approach is based on a threshold calibrated using Stein's

an impractical calculation for large graphs. To estimate such covariance, we
develop and analyze a Monte-Carlo strategy, based on the fast transformation of
zero mean and unit variance random variables. This new data-driven denoising

their network topologies. Derrida curves are commonly used to measure the
stability of Boolean networks and several parameters such as the average
in-degree K and the output bias p can indicate if a network is stable,
critical, or unstable. For random unbiased Boolean networks there is a critical
connectivity value Kc=2 such that if K<Kc networks operate in the ordered

of lung diseases, while its manual delineation is unduly burdensome. To
alleviate this time-consuming and potentially subjective manual procedure,
researchers have proposed methods to automatically segment airways from
computerized tomography (CT) images. However, some small-sized airway branches
(e.g., bronchus and terminal bronchioles) significantly aggravate the
difficulty of automatic segmentation by machine learning models. In particular,
the variance of voxel values and the severe data imbalance in airway branches
make the computational module prone to discontinuous and false-negative
predictions. especially for cohorts with different lung diseases. Attention
mechanism has shown the capacity to segment complex structures, while fuzzy
logic can reduce the uncertainty in feature representations. Therefore, the
integration of deep attention networks and fuzzy theory, given by the fuzzy
attention layer, should be an escalated solution for better generalization and
robustness. This paper presents an efficient method for airway segmentation,
comprising a novel fuzzy attention neural network and a comprehensive loss
function to enhance the spatial continuity of airway segmentation. The deep
fuzzy set is formulated by a set of voxels in the feature map and a learnable
Gaussian membership function. Different from the existing attention mechanism,
the proposed channel-specific fuzzy attention addresses the issue of
heterogeneous features in different channels. Furthermore, a novel evaluation
metric is proposed to assess both the continuity and completeness of airway
structures. The efficiency, generalization and robustness of the proposed
method have been proved by training on normal lung disease while testing on
datasets of lung cancer, COVID-19 and pulmonary fibrosis.

analyze how mechanisms known to promote cooperation within a single group --

evolutionary outcomes in the presence of competition among groups. We find that
population structures most conducive to cooperation in multi-scale systems may
differ from those most conducive within a single group. Likewise, for
competitive interactions with a continuous range of strategies we find that
among-group selection may fail to produce socially optimal outcomes, but it can
nonetheless produce second-best solutions that balance individual incentives to
defect with the collective incentives for cooperation. We conclude by
describing the broad applicability of multi-scale evolutionary models to

taking into account the black hole interior, so that in the resulting theory
the canonical commutation relations are satisfied exactly, and the Hamiltonian
has the standard form. However, unlike some papers, in which the expansion of
the quantum field in spherical harmonics is used, here we use an expansion in
scatteringlike states for energies larger than the mass of the field. This
reveals a strange property of the resulting quantum field theory - doubling of
the quantum states, which look as having the same asymptotic momentum to an
observer located far away from the black hole. This purely topological effect
cannot be eliminated by moving away from the black hole.

the retriever with our proposed Cross-lingual Inverse Cloze Task (X-ICT), a

electronic and conformational degrees of freedom over a wide range of

sampling the conformational space of soft materials. This could in principle be
realized by connecting the coarse-grained (CG) methodologies required for
adequate conformational sampling to conformationally-averaged electronic

repeated quantum-chemical calculations. Computational demands of such

non-conjugated, radical-containing polymers, promising materials for

learn the dependence of electronic properties on polymer conformation at CG

our method by comparing it against a full backmapping-based approach, and find
good agreement between both methods. This work demonstrates the potential of
the proposed method to accelerate multiscale workflows, and provides a

the self-similar power-law prediction of the virial theorem. We perform a
comprehensive study of such deviations using CAMELS, a suite of hydrodynamic
simulations with extensive variations in feedback prescriptions. We use a
combination of two machine learning tools (random forest and symbolic
regression) to search for analogues of the $Y-M$ relation which are more robust
to feedback processes for low masses ($M\lesssim 10^{14}\, h^{-1} \, M_\odot$);
we find that simply replacing $Y\rightarrow Y(1+M_*/M_\mathrm{gas})$ in the
relation makes it remarkably self-similar. This could serve as a robust
multiwavelength mass proxy for low-mass clusters and galaxy groups. Our
methodology can also be generally useful to improve the domain of validity of
other astrophysical scaling relations.
  We also forecast that measurements of the $Y-M$ relation could provide
percent-level constraints on certain combinations of feedback parameters and/or
rule out a major part of the parameter space of supernova and AGN feedback
models used in current state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations. Our results
can be useful for using upcoming SZ surveys (e.g., SO, CMB-S4) and galaxy

likely arises from the lens model mass distribution, where an inaccurate choice
of model could in principle bias the value of $H_0$. A Bayesian hierarchical
framework has been proposed which combines lens systems with kinematic data,
constraining the mass profile shape at a population level. The framework has
been previously validated on a small sample of lensing galaxies drawn from
hydro-simulations. The goal of this work is to expand the validation to a more
general set of lenses consistent with observed systems, as well as confirm the
capacity of the method to combine two lens populations: one which has time
delay information and one which lacks time delays and has systematically
different image radii. For this purpose, we generate samples of analytic lens
mass distributions made of baryons+dark matter and fit the subsequent mock
images with standard power-law models. Corresponding kinematics data are also
emulated. The hierarchical framework applied to an ensemble of time-delay
lenses allows us to correct the $H_0$ bias associated with model choice,
finding $H_0$ within $1.5\sigma$ of the fiducial value. We then combine this
set with a sample of corresponding lens systems which have no time delays and
have a source at lower $z$, resulting in a systematically smaller image radius
relative to their effective radius. The hierarchical framework successfully
accounts for this effect, recovering a value of $H_0$ which is both more
precise ($\sigma\sim2\%$) and more accurate ($0.7\%$ median offset) than the
time-delay set alone. This result confirms that non-time-delay lenses can
nonetheless contribute valuable constraining power to the determination of
$H_0$ via their kinematic constraints, assuming they come from the same global
population as the time-delay set.

clusters at $1.3<z<2.8$ from the CARLA survey. Our main finding is that the
morphology-density and passive-density relations are already in place at
$z\sim2$. The cluster at z = 2.8 shows a similar fraction of ETG as in the
other clusters in its densest region. The cluster ETG and passive fractions
depend on local environment and mildly on galaxy mass. They do not depend on
global environment. At lower local densities, the CARLA clusters exhibit a
lower ETG fraction than clusters at z = 1. This implies that the densest
regions influence the morphology of galaxies first, with lower density local
environments either taking longer or only influencing galaxy morphology at
later cosmological times. Interestingly, we find evidence of high merger
fractions in our clusters with respect to the field, but the merger fractions
do not significantly depend on local environment. This suggests that merger
remnants in the lowest density regions can reform disks fuelled by cold gas
flows, but those in the highest density regions are cut-off from the gas supply
and will become passive ETG. The percentages of active ETG, with respect to the
total ETG population, are $21 \pm 6\%$ and $59 \pm 14\% $ at 1.35 < z <1.65 and
1.65 < z < 2.05, respectively, and about half of them are mergers or asymmetric
in both redshift bins. All the spectroscopically confirmed CARLA clusters have
properties consistent with clusters and proto-clusters. The differences between
our results and those that find enhanced star formation and star-bursts in
cluster cores at similar redshifts are probably due to the different sample
selection criteria, which choose different environments that host galaxies with
different accretion and pre-processing histories.

subdomains. In this paper, we describe a high accuracy meshless method that
uses domain decomposition and cloud-based interpolation of scattered data to
solve the heat conduction equation in such situations. The polyharmonic spline
(PHS) function with appended polynomial of prescribed degree is used for
discretization. A flux balance condition is satisfied at the interface points
and the clouds of interpolation points are restricted to be within respective
domains. Compared with previously proposed meshless algorithms with domain
decomposition, the cloud-based interpolations are numerically better
conditioned, and achieve high accuracy through the appended polynomial. The
accuracy of the algorithm is demonstrated in several two and three dimensional
problems using manufactured solutions to the heat conduction equation with
sharp discontinuity in thermal conductivity. Subsequently, we demonstrate the
applicability of the algorithm to solve heat conduction in complex domains with
practical boundary conditions and internal heat generation. Systematic

ameliorating problems of pattern robustness and selection, in addition to more
realistic modelling in developmental biology. Most work to date has considered
prescribed domains evolving as given functions of time, but not the scenario of
concentration-dependent dynamics, which is also highly relevant in a
developmental setting. Here, we study such concentration-dependent domain
evolution for reaction-diffusion systems to elucidate fundamental aspects of
these more complex models. We pose a general form of one-dimensional domain
evolution, and extend this to $N$-dimensional manifolds under mild constitutive
assumptions in lieu of developing a full tissue-mechanical model. In the 1D
case, we are able to extend linear stability analysis around homogeneous
equilibria, though this is of limited utility in understanding complex pattern
dynamics in fast growth regimes. We numerically demonstrate a variety of
dynamical behaviours in 1D and 2D planar geometries, giving rise to several new
phenomena, especially near regimes of critical bifurcation boundaries such as
peak-splitting instabilities. For sufficiently fast growth and contraction,
concentration-dependence can have an enormous impact on the nonlinear dynamics
of the system both qualitatively and quantitatively. We highlight crucial
differences between 1D evolution and higher dimensional models, explaining
obstructions for linear analysis and underscoring the importance of careful
constitutive choices in defining domain evolution in higher dimensions. We
raise important questions in the modelling and analysis of biological systems,
in addition to numerous mathematical questions that appear tractable in the
one-dimensional setting, but are vastly more difficult for higher-dimensional
models.

inspired by the Deep-Ritz method proposed in [12]. We first formulate the
solution of non-Newtonian ice flow model into the minimizer of a variational
integral with boundary constraints. The solution is then approximated by a deep
neural network whose loss function is the variational integral plus soft
constraint from the mixed boundary conditions. Instead of introducing mesh
grids or basis functions to evaluate the loss function, our method only
requires uniform samplers of the domain and boundaries. To address instability
in real-world scaling, we re-normalize the input of the network at the first
layer and balance the regularizing factors for each individual boundary.
Finally, we illustrate the performance of our method by several numerical
experiments, including a 2D model with analytical solution, Arolla glacier
model with real scaling and a 3D model with periodic boundary conditions.
Numerical results show that our proposed method is efficient in solving the
non-Newtonian mechanics arising from glacier modeling with nonlinear rheology.

predicting many properties of a quantum state with few measurements. Two
classical shadow protocols have been extensively studied in the literature: the
single-qubit (local) Pauli measurement, which is well suited for predicting
local operators but inefficient for large operators; and the global Clifford
measurement, which is efficient for low-rank operators but infeasible on
near-term quantum devices due to the extensive gate overhead. In this work, we
demonstrate a scalable classical shadow tomography approach for generic
randomized measurements implemented with finite-depth local Clifford random
unitary circuits, which interpolates between the limits of Pauli and Clifford
measurements. The method combines the recently proposed locally-scrambled
classical shadow tomography framework with tensor network techniques to achieve
scalability for computing the classical shadow reconstruction map and
evaluating various physical properties. The method enables classical shadow
tomography to be performed on shallow quantum circuits with superior sample
efficiency and minimal gate overhead and is friendly to noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We show that the shallow-circuit
measurement protocol provides immediate, exponential advantages over the Pauli
measurement protocol for predicting quasi-local operators. It also enables a
more efficient fidelity estimation compared to the Pauli measurement.

its zero-frequency susceptibility for a phase difference of $\phi=\pi$. This
signal is notably insensitive to the chemical potential in the normal region,
while trivial zero-energy states only causes signals in the susceptibility that
is highly varying with the chemical potential, thus turning gating of the

that, by tuning the junction transparency, critical currents in both short and

intimately linked to Majorana non-locality. Finally, we show that our results

kinds of monomers $A$ and $B$ fluctuating in a solution are investigated on a
simple cubic lattice using the Wang-Landau MC algorithm. These knots have a
more complex phase diagram than knots formed by homopolymers, including the
possible presence of metastable states. Two different setups are considered: i)
charged block copolymers in a ion solution and ii) neutral copolymers with the
$A$ monomers above and the $B$ monomers below the theta point. A precise
interpretation of the peaks observed in the plots of the specific heat capacity
is provided. In view of possible applications in medicine and the construction
of intelligent materials, it is also shown that the behavior of copolymer rings
can be tuned by changing both their monomer configuration and topology. We find
that the most stable compact states are formed by charged copolymers in which
very short segments with $A$ monomers are alternated by short segments with $B$
monomers. In such knots the transition from the compact to the expanded state
is very fast, leading to a narrow and high peak in the specific heat capacity
which appears at very high temperatures. The effects of topology allow to tune
the radius of gyration of the knotted polymer ring and to increase or decrease
the temperatures at which the observed phase transitions or rearrangements of
the system occur. While we observe a general fading out of the influence of
topology in longer polymers, our simulations have captured a few exceptions to
this rule.

transverse electric fields. The nearest-neighbor tight-binding model of
graphene is used to formulate the corresponding transport problem, and the
algorithm of recursive Green's function method is applied to solve for the
corresponding transmission coefficient. In the case of two-filter valves, the
result explicitly demonstrates the existence of a pronounced on-off contrast in
electron transmission between the two configurations of valves, namely, one
with identical and the other with opposite valley polarities in the two
constituent filters. The contrast is shown to be enhanced when increasing the
number of filters in valves. Signatures of Fano-Fabry-Perot type resonances in
association with interface scattering and inter-filter spacing are illustrated.
Electron backscattering due to impurities is found to be sizably suppressed,
with the valve performance showing considerable robustness against edge
roughness scattering. On the other hand, the presence of a uniaxial strain
modifies the electron transmission and results in an interesting quasi-periodic
modulation of transmission as we vary the strain strength.

variability timescale is comparable to the dynamical time of the event horizon,
suggesting that the emission may come from a compact region nearby the nucleus.
However, the emission mechanism for these flares is not well understood. Recent
high-resolution general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations show the
occurrence of episodic magnetic reconnection events that can power flares
nearby the black hole event horizon. In this work, we analyze the radiative
properties of the reconnecting current layer under the extreme plasma
conditions applicable to the black hole in M87 from the first principles. We
show that abundant pair production is expected in the vicinity of the
reconnection layer, to the extent that the produced secondary pair plasma
dominates the reconnection dynamics. Using analytic estimates backed by
two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations we demonstrate that in the
presence of strong synchrotron cooling, reconnection can produce a hard
power-law distribution of pair plasma imprinted in the outgoing synchrotron (up
to a few tens of MeV) and the inverse-Compton signal (up to TeV). We produce
synthetic radiation spectra from our simulations, which can be directly

fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) since it exhibits high intra-class

a method that effectively captures subtle changes by aggregating context-aware
features from most relevant image-regions and their importance in
discriminating fine-grained categories avoiding the bounding-box and/or

advancement in self-attention and graph neural networks (GNNs) approaches to
include a simple yet effective relation-aware feature transformation and its
refinement using a context-aware attention mechanism to boost the
discriminability of the transformed feature in an end-to-end learning process.

typically $0.1\text{-}10\%$ of the pulsar spin-down power (gamma-ray
efficiency), implying that a significant fraction of the available
electromagnetic energy is dissipated in the magnetosphere and reradiated as
high-energy photons. To investigate this phenomenon we model a pulsar
magnetosphere using 3D particle-in-cell simulations with strong synchrotron
cooling. We particularly focus on the dynamics of the equatorial current sheet
where magnetic reconnection and energy dissipation take place. Our simulations
demonstrate that a fraction of the spin-down power dissipated in the
magnetospheric current sheet is controlled by the rate of magnetic reconnection
at microphysical plasma scales and only depends on the pulsar inclination
angle. We demonstrate that the maximum energy and the distribution function of
accelerated pairs is controlled by the available magnetic energy per particle
near the current sheet, the magnetization parameter. The shape and the extent
of the plasma distribution is imprinted in the observed synchrotron emission,
in particular, in the peak and the cutoff of the observed spectrum. We study
how the strength of synchrotron cooling affects the observed variety of
spectral shapes. Our conclusions naturally explain why pulsars with higher
spin-down power have wider spectral shapes and, as a result, lower gamma-ray

x 10(-10) erg/cm(-2)/s, three orders of magnitude lower than the gamma-ray flux
measured on the same date. The spectra are well fitted with two components of
thermal plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium, one at a temperature
~0.75 keV, and the other at temperature in the 2.5-3.4 keV range. With the RGS
we measured an average flux 1.53 x 10(-10) erg/cm(-2)/s in the 5-35 Angstrom
range, but the flux in the continuum and especially in the lines in the 23-35
Angstrom range decreased during the 50 ks RGS exposure by almost 10%,
indicating short term variability on hours' time scale. The RGS spectrum can be
fitted with three thermal components, respectively at plasma temperature
between 70 and 150 eV, 0.64 keV and 2.4 keV. The post-maximum epochs of the
exposures fall between those of two grating spectra observed in the 2006
eruption on days 14 and 26: they are consistent with a similar spectral
evolution, but in 2021 cooling seems to have been more rapid. Iron is depleted
in the ejecta with respect to solar values, while nitrogen is enhanced.

Accurate image fusion relies on accurate segmentation of the prostate on

speckle and shadowing) in ultrasound images limit the performance of automated
prostate segmentation techniques and generalizing these methods to new image
domains is inherently difficult. In this study, we address these challenges by
introducing a novel 2.5D deep neural network for prostate segmentation on
ultrasound images. Our approach addresses the limitations of transfer learning
and finetuning methods (i.e., drop in performance on the original training data
when the model weights are updated) by combining a supervised domain adaptation
technique and a knowledge distillation loss. The knowledge distillation loss
allows the preservation of previously learned knowledge and reduces the
performance drop after model finetuning on new datasets. Furthermore, our
approach relies on an attention module that considers model feature positioning
information to improve the segmentation accuracy. We trained our model on 764
subjects from one institution and finetuned our model using only ten subjects
from subsequent institutions. We analyzed the performance of our method on
three large datasets encompassing 2067 subjects from three different

great power in learning semantic aligning cross-modal models. The common choice
to measure the distance between the feature representations of the image-text
pairs is the cosine similarity, which can be considered as the negative inner
product of features embedded on a sphere mathematically. While such topology
benefits from the low computational resources consumption and a properly
defined uniformity, typically, there are two major drawbacks when applied.
First, it is vulnerable to the semantic ambiguity phenomenon resulting from the
noise in the weakly-related image-text pairs. Second, the learning progress is
unstable and fragile at the beginning. Although, in the practice of former
studies, a learnable softmax temperature parameter and a long warmup scheme are
employed to meliorate the training progress, still there lacks an in-depth
analysis of these problems. In this work, we discuss the desired properties of
the topology and its endowed distance function for the embedding vectors of
feature representations from the view of optimization. We then propose a rather
simple solution to improve the aforementioned problem. That is, we map the
feature representations onto the oblique manifold endowed with the negative
inner product as the distance function. In the experimental analysis, we show
that we can improve the baseline performance by a large margin (e.g. 4% in the
zero-shot image to text retrieval task) by changing only two lines of the

correlation functions of $\cal O$. We study the matching of the genus zero one-

cylinder Euclidean path integrals. The non-Gaussian statistics of the matrix
elements of $\cal O$ correspond to a generalization of the ETH ansatz.
  We describe multiple ways to construct double-scaled matrix models that
reproduce the gravitational disk correlators. One method involves imposing an
operator equation obeyed by $H$ and $\cal O$ as a constraint on the two
matrices. Separately, we design a model that reproduces certain double-scaled
SYK correlators that may be scaled once more to obtain the disk correlators.
  We show that in any single-trace, two-matrix model, the genus zero
two-boundary expectation value, with up to one $\cal O$ insertion on each
boundary, can be computed directly from all of the genus zero one-boundary
correlators. Applied to the models of interest, we find that these cylinder
observables depend on the details of the double-scaling limit. To the extent we
have checked, it is possible to reproduce the gravitational double-trumpet,
which is UV divergent, from a systematic classification of matrix model `t

demonstrate how power spectral analysis can be used to attribute which scales
in a SNR are driven by RTI and which must be caused by intrinsic asymmetries in

RTI and identify a dominant angular mode which represents the largest scale
that efficiently grows via RTI. We find that this dominant mode relates to the
density scale height in the ejecta, and therefore reveals the density profile
of the SN ejecta. If there is significant structure in a SNR on angular scales
larger than this mode, then it is likely caused by anisotropies in the
explosion. Structure on angular scales smaller than the dominant mode exhibits
a steep scaling with wavenumber, possibly too steep to be consistent with a
turbulent cascade, and therefore might be determined by the saturation of RTI
at different length scales (although systematic 3D studies are needed to
investigate this). We also demonstrate, consistent with previous studies, that
this power spectrum is independent of the magnitude and length scales of
perturbations in the surrounding medium and therefore this diagnostic is
unaffected by ``clumpiness"" in the CSM.

linear shear stress-strain response with negligible macro-plastic deformation
due to the small-amplitude acoustic oscillation. However, these waves reduce
the interparticle friction and contact stiffness through the acoustic
lubrication of grain contacts, resulting in an increase in the structural
disorder or compactivity and softening of dynamic modulus. The compaction
associated with this microscopic friction decrease is consistent with the

a separation scale $\Lambda\sim400\;$MeV into the internal photon propagator,

long-distance part to be treated with coordinate-space methods, thereby
avoiding power-law finite-size effects altogether. In order to predict the

the forward hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering amplitude and relate the
latter via a dispersive sum rule to $\gamma^*\gamma^*$ fusion cross-sections.

remained overlooked. Here, using a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal as model
biological material, confined within nanoporous microfluidic environments, we
study molecular assembly driven by nanoporous substrates. We demonstrate that
nanoporous polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces, due to selective permeation of
water molecules, drive transition of disordered isotropic phase to ordered
nematic, and higher order columnar phases under isothermal conditions.
Synergistically, by tailoring the wettability, the surface-to-volume ratio, and

transitions with a high degree of spatial and temporal control. Using a

a simple mathematical model, we analyze the phase transitions, and construct a

dense correspondences between shapes by first obtaining high-dimensional
neighborhood-preserving embeddings of low-dimensional point clouds and
subsequently aligning the source and target embeddings using locally linear
transformations. We demonstrate that learning the embedding using a new
LLE-inspired point cloud reconstruction objective results in accurate shape
correspondences. More specifically, the approach comprises an end-to-end
learnable framework of extracting high-dimensional neighborhood-preserving
embeddings, estimating locally linear transformations in the embedding space,
and reconstructing shapes via divergence measure-based alignment of
probabilistic density functions built over reconstructed and target shapes. Our
approach enforces embeddings of shapes in correspondence to lie in the same
universal/canonical embedding space, which eventually helps regularize the
learning process and leads to a simple nearest neighbors approach between shape
embeddings for finding reliable correspondences. Comprehensive experiments show
that the new method makes noticeable improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches on standard shape correspondence benchmark datasets covering both
human and nonhuman shapes.

extension that efficiently supports geospatial data. Spatial Parquet inherits
all the advantages of Parquet for non-spatial data, such as rich data types,
compression, and column/row filtering. Additionally, it adds three new features
to accommodate geospatial data. First, it introduces a geospatial data type
that can encode all standard spatial data types in a column format compatible
with Parquet. Second, it adds a new lossless and efficient encoding method,
termed FP-delta, that is customized to efficiently store geospatial coordinates
stored in floating-point format. Third, it adds a light-weight spatial index
that allows the reader to skip non-relevant parts of the file for increased
read efficiency. Experiments on large-scale real data showed that
SpatialParquet can reduce the data size by a factor of three, even without
compression. Compression can further reduce the storage size. Additionally,
Spatial Parquet can reduce the reading time by two orders of magnitude when the
light-weight index is applied. This initial prototype can open new research

high-dimensional output. Computer simulation models have many areas of
applications, including social-economic processes, agriculture, environmental,
biology, engineering and physics problems. A deterministic transformation of
inputs is performed by deep learning and predictions are calculated by
traditional Gaussian Processes. We illustrate our methodology using a
simulation of motorcycle accidents and simulations of an Ebola outbreak.
Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.

J1058+5443) at redshift 0.479 is reported as so-far the best candidate of true
type-2 quasar with disappearance of central BLRs. There are so-far no definite
conclusions on the very existence of true type-2 AGN, mainly due to detected
optical broad emission lines in high quality spectra of some previously
classified candidates of true type-2 AGN. Here, not similar as previous
reported candidates for true type-2 AGN among narrow emission-line galaxies
with weak AGN activities but strong stellar lights, the definite blue quasar
SDSS J1058+5443 can be well confirmed as a true type-2 quasar due to apparent
quasar-shape blue continuum emissions but apparent loss of both the optical
broad Balmer emission lines and the NUV broad Mg~{\sc ii} emission line. Based
on different model functions and F-test statistical technique, after
considering blue-shifted optical and UV Fe~{\sc ii} emissions, there are no
apparent broad optical Balmer emission lines and/or broad NUV Mg~{\sc ii} line,
and the confidence level is smaller than 1sigma to support broad optical and
NUV emission lines. Moreover, assumed the Virialization assumption to broad
line emission clouds, the re-constructed broad emission lines strongly indicate
that the probable intrinsic broad emission lines, if there were, cannot be
hidden or overwhelmed in the noises of SDSS spectrum of SDSS J1058+5443.
Therefore, SDSS J1058+5443, so-far the best and robust candidate of true type-2
quasar, leads to the further clear conclusion on the very existence of true
type-2 AGN.

on-board processing entails data compression, latency caused by wireless

black-box attacks where the adversary only sees the state observations and
effectively treats the victim as any other part of the environment. In this
work, we experiment with white-box adversarial policies to study whether an
agent's internal state can offer useful information for other agents. We make
three contributions. First, we introduce white-box adversarial policies in
which an attacker can observe a victim's internal state at each timestep.
Second, we demonstrate that white-box access to a victim makes for better
attacks in two-agent environments, resulting in both faster initial learning
and higher asymptotic performance against the victim. Third, we show that
training against white-box adversarial policies can be used to make learners in
single-agent environments more robust to domain shifts.

wafer using standard micro-nano fabrication techniques. The thermal behavior of
silicon indicates that the Young's modulus of silicon decreases with an
increase in temperature (around 63 ppm/K). This leads to a softening of the
silicon material resulting in the proof mass (PM) displacing (or sagging) under
the influence of an increasing temperature. It results in the change on the
measured gravity and it is expressed as a temperature sensitivity in terms of
change in gravity per degree temperature. The temperature sensitivity for the
silicon based MEMS gravimeter is found to be 60.14-64.87 muGal/mK, 61.76
muGal/mK and 62.76 muGal/mK for experimental, finite element analysis (FEA)

temperature sensitivity is depended on material properties used to fabricate
the MEMS devices. In this paper the experimental measurements of thermal sag
are presented, along with analytical calculations and simulations of the effect

However, in these studies, the GRB rate measured at any redshift is an average
over all galaxies at that epoch. A deep understanding of the connection between
GRB production and environment also needs to characterize the population of GRB
host galaxies directly. Based on a complete sample of GRB hosts, we constrain
the stellar-mass function (SMF) of GRB hosts, and examine redshift evolution in
the GRB host population. Our results confirm that a strong redshift evolution
in energy (with an evolution index of $\delta=2.47^{+0.73}_{-0.89}$) or in
density ($\delta=1.82^{+0.22}_{-0.59}$) is needed in order to account for the

detrimental in populations with limited access to healthcare. A promising
technology to address these complications is the electrohysterogram (EHG),
which measures abdominal electric potentials. Since EHG recordings are measured
noninvasively, they record uterine electrical activity together with activity
from other interfering sources, making their analysis more challenging. To
facilitate the analysis of EHGs, we separate these measurements into uterine
activity that is more variable across different electrodes and over time, which
we term localized activity, and activity that is more evenly distributed in
space and time. We represent multi-electrode EHGs as tensors and develop a
Bayesian tensor decomposition for estimating localized and distributed
electrical activities. To demonstrate that our method can estimate localized
and distributed activities more accurately than existing methods, we simulate
EHG measurements based on previous characterizations of the activities
comprising these measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method in separating EHG bursts from other interfering activities recorded
in EHGs using real measurements from two public datasets. Our results show that
our method denoises EHG bursts with higher signal-to-noise ratios, defined as
power ratios between EHG bursts and segments with only baseline EHG activity,
than alternative methods. Such accurate estimation of uterine and other
activities from EHG measurements could be useful for more precisely
characterizing patterns of activity in EHGs, which is a step forward towards

complex models such as Bayesian neural networks. The approach is more scalable
to large data than Markov Chain Monte Carlo, it embraces more expressive models

models: (1) a primary model, tasked with performing regression or
classification; and (2) a secondary, expressive (e.g. implicit) model that
defines an approximate posterior distribution over the parameters of the
primary model. However, we optimise the parameters of the posterior model via
gradient descent according to a Monte Carlo estimate of the posterior
predictive distribution -- which is our only approximation (other than the
posterior model). Only a likelihood needs to be specified, which can take
various forms such as loss functions and synthetic likelihoods, thus providing
a form of a likelihood-free approach. Furthermore, we formulate the approach
such that the posterior samples can either be independent of, or conditionally
dependent upon the inputs to the primary model. The latter approach is shown to
be capable of increasing the apparent complexity of the primary model. We see
this being useful in applications such as surrogate and physics-based models.
To promote how the Bayesian paradigm offers more than just uncertainty

robots have been leveraged to automate inspection data collection. Automating
the segmentations of multiclass elements and surface defects on the elements in
the large volume of inspection image data would facilitate an efficient and
effective assessment of the bridge condition. Training separate single-task
networks for element parsing (i.e., semantic segmentation of multiclass

recently, here, via scanning tunneling microscope, we image the quantum melting
of Wigner solid realized by further varying the moire superstructure in
monolayer YbCl3/graphene heterostructure. The Wigner solid is constructed on
the two-dimensional ensemble of interfacial electron-hole pairs derived from

convolution in TS-Conv is supervised by the oriented bounding box (OBB)
prediction associated with spatial coordinates. While sampling positions and
convolutional kernel of the classification convolution are designed to be

initialization is still far behind. Initialization pruning is more efficacious
when it comes to scaling computation cost of the network. Furthermore, it
handles overfitting just as well as post training dropout.
  In approbation of the above reasons, the paper presents two approaches to
prune at initialization. The goal is to achieve higher sparsity while
preserving performance. 1) K-starts, begins with k random p-sparse matrices at
initialization. In the first couple of epochs the network then determines the
""fittest"" of these p-sparse matrices in an attempt to find the ""lottery ticket""
p-sparse network. The approach is adopted from how evolutionary algorithms find
the best individual. Depending on the Neural Network architecture, fitness
criteria can be based on magnitude of network weights, magnitude of gradient
accumulation over an epoch or a combination of both. 2) Dissipating gradients
approach, aims at eliminating weights that remain within a fraction of their
initial value during the first couple of epochs. Removing weights in this
manner despite their magnitude best preserves performance of the network.
Contrarily, the approach also takes the most epochs to achieve higher sparsity.
3) Combination of dissipating gradients and kstarts outperforms either methods
and random dropout consistently.
  The benefits of using the provided pertaining approaches are: 1) They do not
require specific knowledge of the classification task, fixing of dropout
threshold or regularization parameters 2) Retraining of the model is neither
necessary nor affects the performance of the p-sparse network.

benchmark, based on the existing document-level event extraction dataset. We
first define the new problem and reconstruct the corpus by a novel N -Way-D-Doc
sampling instead of the traditional N -Way-K-Shot strategy. Then we adjust the
current document-level neural models into the few-shot setting to provide
baseline results under in- and cross-domain settings. Since the argument
extraction depends on the context from multiple sentences and the learning
process is limited to very few examples, we find this novel task to be very
challenging with substantively low performance. Considering FewDocAE is closely
related to practical use under low-resource regimes, we hope this benchmark
encourages more research in this direction. Our data and codes will be
available online.

vision sensing on mobile devices. EV-Tach is designed as a high-fidelity and
convenient tachometer by introducing dynamic vision sensor as a new sensing
modality to capture the high-speed rotation precisely under various real-world
scenarios. By designing a series of signal processing algorithms bespoke for
dynamic vision sensing on mobile devices, EV-Tach is able to extract the
rotational speed accurately from the event stream produced by dynamic vision
sensing on rotary targets. According to our extensive evaluations, the Relative
Mean Absolute Error (RMAE) of EV-Tach is as low as 0.03% which is comparable to
the state-of-the-art laser tachometer under fixed measurement mode. Moreover,
EV-Tach is robust to subtle movement of user's hand, therefore, can be used as
a handheld device, where the laser tachometer fails to produce reasonable

distinct spin properties. Measuring these properties with gravitational waves
provides an opportunity to unveil the origins of binary black holes. Recent
work draws conflicting conclusions regarding the spin distribution observed by
LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK). Some analyses suggest that a fraction of the observed
black-hole spin vectors are significantly misaligned (by $>90^\circ$) relative
to the orbital angular momentum. This has been interpreted to mean that some
binaries in the LVK dataset are assembled dynamically in dense stellar
environments. Other analyses find support for a sub-population of binaries with
negligible spin and no evidence for significantly misaligned spin -- a result
consistent with the field formation scenario. In this work, we study the spin
properties of binary black holes in the third LVK gravitational-wave transient
catalog. We find that there is insufficient data to resolve the existence of a
sub-population of binaries with negligible black-hole spin (the presence of
this sub-population is supported by a modest Bayes factor of 1.7). We find
modest support for the existence of mergers with extreme spin tilt angles $>
90^\circ$ (the presence of extreme-tilt binaries is favored by a Bayes factor
of 10.1). Only one thing is clear: at least some of the LVK binaries formed in
the field. At most $89\%$ of binaries are assembled dynamically (99\%
credibility), though, the true branching fraction could be much lower, even
negligible.

which at each round, a player chooses an arm, observes a symbol, and receives
an unobserved reward in the form of the symbol's self-information. Thus, the
expected reward of an arm is the Shannon entropy of the probability mass
function of the source that generates its symbols. The player aims to maximize
the expected total reward associated with the entropy values of the arms
played. Under the assumption that the alphabet size is known, two UCB-based
algorithms are proposed for the IMAB model which consider the biases of the

term in the entropy estimation. The second algorithm relies on data-dependent
confidence intervals that adapt to sources with small entropy values.
Performance guarantees are provided by upper bounding the expected regret of

behavior of these algorithms is compared to the Lai-Robbins lower bound for the
pseudo regret. Additionally, under the assumption that the \textit{exact}

extensively studied in the past. However, the opposite direction, that is,
determining the `distance' between an uncontrollable system to the set of
controllable systems, has seldom been considered. In this paper, we address
this problem by defining the notion of zero-norm distance to controllability
(ZNDC) to be the smallest number of entries (parameters) in the system matrices
that need to be perturbed to make the original system controllable. We show
genericity exists in this problem, so that other matrix norms (such as the
$2$-norm or the Frobenius norm) adopted in this notion are nonsense. For ZNDC,
we show it is NP-hard to compute, even when only the state matrix can be
perturbed. We then provide some nontrivial lower and upper bounds. For its
computation, we provide two heuristic algorithms. The first one is by
transforming the ZNDC into a problem of structural controllability of linearly
parameterized systems, and then greedily selecting the candidate links
according to a suitable objective function. The second one is based on the
weighted $l_1$-norm relaxation and the convex-concave procedure, which is
tailored for ZNDC when additional structural constraints are involved in the
perturbed parameters. Finally, we examine the performance of our proposed
algorithms in several typical uncontrollable networks in multi-agent systems.

solutions, causality violation in pre-acceleration and the need for an extra
second-order derivative initial condition. In our current program we reexamine
this old problem from the perspective of non-Markovian dynamics in open
systems, applied earlier to backreaction problems in the early universe. Here
we consider a harmonic atom coupled to a scalar field, which acts effectively
like a supra-Ohmic environment, as in scalar electrodynamics. Our analysis
shows that a) there is no need for specifying a second derivative for the
initial condition; b) there is no pre-acceleration. These undesirable features
in conventional treatments arise from an inconsistent Markovian assumption:
these equations were regarded as Markovian ab initio, not as a limit of the
backreaction-imbued non-Markovian equation of motion. If one starts with the
full non-Markovian dynamical equation and takes the proper Markovian limit
judiciously, no harms are done. Finally, c) There is no causal relation between
the higher-derivative term in the equation of motion and the existence of
runaway solutions. If the charge has an effective size greater than this
critical value, its dynamics is stable. When this reasonable condition is met,
radiation reaction understood and treated correctly in the non-Ohmic
non-Markovian dynamics still obeys a third-order derivative equation, but it
does not require a second derivative initial condition, and there is no
pre-acceleration.

contributors' general attitudes towards skills in OSS. In this paper, we
address this gap by administering a survey to a diverse set of 455 OSS
contributors. Guided by these responses as well as prior literature on software
development expertise and social factors of OSS, we develop a model of skills
in OSS that considers the many contexts OSS contributors work in. This model
has 45 skills in the following 9 categories: technical skills, working styles,
problem solving, contribution types, project-specific skills, interpersonal
skills, external relations, management, and characteristics. Through a mix of
qualitative and quantitative analyses, we find that OSS contributors are
actively motivated to improve skills and perceive many benefits in sharing
their skills with others. We then use this analysis to derive a set of design
implications and best practices for those who incorporate skills into OSS tools
and platforms, such as GitHub.

closed kinematic chain in the presence of an inaccurate kinematics model is
addressed using adaptive machine learning. The kinematic parameters pertaining
to the relative position/orientation uncertainties of the interconnected
manipulators are updated online by two cascaded estimators in order to tune a
cooperative controller for achieving accurate motion tracking with minimum-norm
actuation force. This technique permits accurate calibration of the relative
kinematics of the involved manipulators without needing high precision
end-point sensing or force measurements, and hence it is economically
justified. Investigating the stability of the entire real-time
estimator/controller system reveals that the convergence and stability of the
adaptive control process can be ensured if i) the direction of the angular
velocity vector does not remain constant over time, and ii) the initial
kinematic parameter error is upper bounded by a scaler function of some known
parameters. The adaptive controller is proved to be singularity-free even
though the control law involves inverting the approximation of a matrix
computed at the estimated parameters. Experimental results demonstrate the
sensitivity of the tracking performance of the conventional inverse dynamic
control scheme to kinematic inaccuracies, while the tracking error is
significantly reduced by the self-tuning cooperative controller.

However, a recent explosion of multimedia Internet applications (such as
teleconferencing and video streaming for instance) renews an interest in fast
compression that also squeezes out as much redundancy as possible. In 2009
Jarek Duda invented his asymmetric numeral system (ANS). Apart from a beautiful
mathematical structure, it is very efficient and offers compression with a very
low residual redundancy. ANS works well for any symbol source statistics.
Besides, ANS has become a preferred compression algorithm in the IT industry.
However, designing ANS instance requires a random selection of its symbol
spread function. Consequently, each ANS instance offers compression with a
slightly different compression rate.
  The paper investigates compression optimality of ANS. It shows that ANS is
optimal (i.e. the entropies of encoding and source are equal) for any symbol
sources whose probability distribution is described by natural powers of 1/2.
We use Markov chains to calculate ANS state probabilities. This allows us to
determine ANS compression rate precisely. We present two algorithms for finding
ANS instances with high compression rates. The first explores state probability
approximations in order to choose ANS instances with better compression rates.
The second algorithm is a probabilistic one. It finds ANS instances, whose
compression rate can be made as close to the best rate as required. This is
done at the expense of the number $\theta$ of internal random ``coin'' tosses.
The algorithm complexity is ${\cal O}(\theta L^3)$, where $L$ is the number of
ANS states. The complexity can be reduced to ${\cal O}(\theta L\log{L})$ if we
use a fast matrix inversion. If the algorithm is implemented on quantum
computer, its complexity becomes ${\cal O}(\theta (\log{L})^3)$.

real-time recognizing interactions between cattle in a single frame in this

Localization Network and Interaction Recognition Network. At every moment,
cattle localization network outputs high-quality interaction proposals from
every detected cattle and feeds them into the interaction recognition network
with a triple-stream architecture. Such a triple-stream network allows us to

three kinds of features are a visual feature that extracts the appearance
representation of interaction proposals, a geometric feature that reflects the
spatial relationship between cattle, and a semantic feature that captures our
prior knowledge of the relationship between the individual action and

however, usually lack spatial information from neighboring frames and suffer
from insufficient feature aggregation. To address the issues, we perform a
progressive way to introduce both temporal information and spatial information
for an integrated enhancement. The temporal information is introduced by the
temporal feature aggregation model (TFAM), by conducting an attention mechanism
between the context frames and the target frame (i.e., the frame to be
detected). Meanwhile, we employ a Spatial Transition Awareness Model (STAM) to
convey the location transition information between each context frame and
target frame. Built upon a transformer-based detector DETR, our PTSEFormer also
follows an end-to-end fashion to avoid heavy post-processing procedures while
achieving 88.1% mAP on the ImageNet VID dataset. Codes are available at

Unfortunately, highly accurate quantum Monte Carlo methods are usually
restricted to the imaginary time domain, and the analytic continuation of the
imaginary time density--density correlation function $F(\mathbf{q},\tau)$ to
real frequencies is a notoriously hard problem. In this work, we argue that no
such analytic continuation is required as $F(\mathbf{q},\tau)$ contains, by

unfamiliar representation. Specifically, we show how we can directly extract
key information such as the temperature or quasi-particle excitation energies
from the $\tau$-domain, which is highly relevant for equation-of-state
measurements of matter under extreme conditions. As a practical example, we
consider \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo results for the uniform

advantageous for many reasons and holds the enticing promise for unprecedented

controller based on a simple control-oriented model and its testing on a
full-fledged simulator. Then, many driving hours are required during the
End-of-Line (EoL) tuning phase to calibrate the controller for the physical
vehicle. Given the recent technological advances, in this paper we consider the
pioneering perspective where the simulator can be run on-board in the
electronic control unit, so as to calculate the nominal control action in
real-time. In this way, it can be shown that, in the EoL phase, we only need to
tune a simple compensator of the mismatch between the expected and the measured
outputs. The resulting approach not only exploits the already available
simulator and nominal controller and significantly simplifies the design
process, but also outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of tracking
accuracy and robustness within a challenging active braking control case study.

the AF-DSC method to explicitly model such sentiment composition in reviews.
AF-DSC first learns sentiment representations for all potential aspects and
then aggregates aspect-level sentiments into a document-level one to perform
document-level sentiment classification. In this way, we obtain the

a new scalar field, namely a Weyl field and a gauge vector boson. Furthermore,
an equivalent form of the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian with a non-minimally
coupled scalar field corresponding to the function $f(R)$ is found. Due to the
geometrical feature of the Weyl field, it turns out that the symmetry breaking
induces a non-minimal coupling, which cannot be expected in the standard $f(R)$
theories. We explain how this affects the evolution of the universe at
cosmological scales. It is shown that there may be a value shift in the Planck
constant and the cosmological constant. This can be regarded as a genuine
exemplification of the cosmological backreaction. Furthermore, one also finds
new features in the evolution of perturbational variables and cosmic microwave
background anisotropy. Moreover, we prove that when a specific $f(R)$ model
invokes inflation, the amplitude of the primordial gravitational waves affects
the evolution of scalar perturbation due to the new non-minimal coupling. As a
case study, we explain how this can be embodied in the Starobinsky inflation.
Finally, we discuss some impacts that this physics can bear and the possibility
of giving a new restriction of the estimation of cosmological variables such as

of glass poses severe challenges to many computer vision tasks, making glass
segmentation as an important computer vision task. Glass does not have its own
visual appearances but only transmit/reflect the appearances of its
surroundings, making it fundamentally different from other common objects. To
address such a challenging task, existing methods typically explore and combine
useful cues from different levels of features in the deep network. As there
exists a characteristic gap between level-different features, i.e., deep layer
features embed more high-level semantics and are better at locating the target
objects while shallow layer features have larger spatial sizes and keep richer
and more detailed low-level information, fusing these features naively thus
would lead to a sub-optimal solution. In this paper, we approach the effective
features fusion towards accurate glass segmentation in two steps. First, we
attempt to bridge the characteristic gap between different levels of features
by developing a Discriminability Enhancement (DE) module which enables
level-specific features to be a more discriminative representation, alleviating
the features incompatibility for fusion. Second, we design a
Focus-and-Exploration Based Fusion (FEBF) module to richly excavate useful
information in the fusion process by highlighting the common and exploring the
difference between level-different features.

($K_s = 2.7~erg/cm^2$), which is dominated by interfacial spin-orbit coupling
(ISOC) in the Pt/Co interface, total effective spin-mixing conductance
($G_{eff,tot} = 0.42 {\times} 10^{15}~{\Omega}^{-1} m^{-2}$) and two-magnon
scattering (${\beta}_{TMS} = 0.46~nm^2$) are first characterized, and the
damping-like torque (${\xi}_{DL}$ = 0.103) and field-like torque (${\xi}_{FL}$
= -0.017) efficiencies are also calculated quantitatively by varying the
thickness of the inserting Co layer. The significant enhancement of
${\xi}_{DL}$ and ${\xi}_{FL}$ in Pt/Co/Py than Pt/Py bilayer system originates
from the interfacial Rashba-Edelstein effect due to the strong ISOC between
Co-3d and Pt-5d orbitals at the Pt/Co interface. Additionally, we find a
considerable out-of-plane spin polarization SOT, which is ascribed to the spin
anomalous Hall effect and possible spin precession effect due to IPMA-induced
perpendicular magnetization at the Pt/Co interface. Our results demonstrate
that the ISOC of the Pt/Co interface plays a vital role in spin transport and
SOTs-generation. Our finds offer an alternative approach to improve the
conventional SOTs efficiencies and generate unconventional SOTs with
out-of-plane spin polarization to develop low power Pt-based spintronic via
tailoring the Pt/FM interface.

into account an approach that is based on a decomposition of any possibly

allows one to fix the reduced-system evolution via a finite set of

global state. We further investigate the case where the CPTP maps are
semigroups with generators in the Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan form;
for two simple qubit models, we identify the positivity domain defined by the

Very recently, direct nondegenerate triple-photon spontaneous downconversion
(NTPSD) with bright photon triplets and strong third-order correlations has
been demonstrated in a superconducting device (2020 Phys. Rev. X 10 011011).
Besides, linear and nonlinear tripartite entanglement in this process have also
been predicted (2018 Phys. Rev. Lett. 120 043601; 2020 Phys. Rev. Lett. 125

quantum superpositions and investigate nonlinear quantum steering effects in
NTPSD.We find that large-size Schr\""odinger cat states of one downconverted

detection. Also, a two-photon Bell entangled state can be generated when only
one mode is homodyned.We further reveal that such ability of remote state
steering originates from nonlinear quantum steerable correlations among the
triplets. This is specifically embodied by the seeming violation of the
Heisenberg uncertainty relation for the inferred variances of two
noncommutating higher-order quadratures of downconverted modes, based on the
outcomes of homodyne detection on the other mode, i.e., nonlinear quantum
steering, compared to original EPR steering. Our results demonstrate
non-Gaussian nonclassical features in NTPSD and would be useful for the

significantly during the past few years in response to anthropogenic climate
change. However, global statistical characteristics and underlying physical
mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here, we adopt a statistical physics
and probability theory based method to investigate the nature of extreme
weather events, particularly the statistics of the day-to-day air temperature
differences. These statistical measurements reveal that the distributions of
the magnitudes of the extreme events satisfy a universal \textit{Gumbel}
distribution, while the waiting time of those extreme events is governed by a
universal \textit{Gamma} function. Further finite-size effects analysis
indicates robust scaling behaviours. We additionally unveil that the cumulative
distribution of logarithmic waiting times between the record events follows an
\textit{Exponential} distribution and that the evolution of this climate system
is directional where the underlying dynamics are related to a decelerating
release of tension. The universal scaling laws are remarkably stable and
unaffected by global warming. Counterintuitively, unlike as expected for record
dynamics, we find that the number of quakes of the extreme temperature
variability does not decay as one over time but with deviations relevant to
large-scale climate extreme events. Our theoretical framework provides a fresh
perspective on the linkage of universality, scaling, and climate systems. The
findings throw light on the nature of the weather variabilities and could guide
us to better forecast extreme events.

including unmyelinated axons, gray matter, and tumors. The purpose of this work
is to quantify the effect of membrane permeability on the estimates of two
popular models neglecting exchange, and compare their performance with a model
including exchange. To this aim, DW-MRI experiments were performed in
controlled environments with Monte-Carlo simulations. The DW-MRI signals were
generated in numerical substrates mimicking biological tissue made of spherical
cells with permeable membranes like cancerous tissue or the brain gray matter.
From these signals, the substrates properties were estimated using SANDI and
VERDICT, the two compartment-based models neglecting exchange, and CEXI, a new
model which includes exchange. Our results show that, in cellular permeable
tissue, the model with exchange outperformed models without exchange in the
estimation of the tissue properties by providing more stable estimates of cell
size, intracellular volume fraction and extracellular diffusion coefficient.
Moreover, the model with exchange estimated accurately the exchange time in the
range of permeability reported for cellular tissue. Finally, the simulations
performed in this work showed that the exchange between the intracellular and
the extracellular space cannot be neglected in permeable tissue with a
conventional PGSE sequence, to obtain accurate estimates. Consequently,
existing compartmentalized models of impermeable tissue cannot be used for
microstructure estimation of cellular permeable tissue.

observations, numerical simulations of CR propagation through the Galaxy help
to increase the level of understanding of Galactic CR transport and diffuse
$\gamma$-ray emission as seen by different experiments. Up to now, the standard
approach at modelling source distributions used as input for such transport
simulations often rely on radial symmetry and analytical functions rather than
individual, observation-based sources. We aim at a redefinition of existing CR
source distributions by combining sources observed with the H.E.S.S. experiment
and simulated random sources, which follow the matter density in the Milky Way.
As a result, H.E.S.S.-inspired Galactic CR source distributions are inferred.
We use the PICARD code to perform 3D-simulations of nuclei and electrons in CR
propagation using our hybrid source distribution models. Furthermore, also
gamma-ray maps and spectra, simulated with the redefined source models, are
evaluated in different regions in the Galaxy and compared with each other to
determine the statistical scatter of the underlying distributions. We find
global consistency between our models and in comparison to previous
simulations, with only some localised fluctuations, e.g. in the spiral arms.
This implementation of a three-dimensional source model based on observations
and simulations enables a new quality of propagation modelling. It offers
possibilities for more realistic CR transport scenarios beyond radial symmetry
and delivers meaningful results in both the arm and interarm regions of the
Galaxy. This gives a more realistic picture of the Galactic $\gamma$-ray sky by
including structures from the source model and not just the gas distributions.

glassy limit. This is mainly inspired by the remarkable resemblance between
active glassy materials and conventional passive glassy matter. Interestingly,
within this limit it has recently been shown that the relaxation dynamics of
active quasi-hard spheres is non-monotonic and most enhanced by activity when
the intrinsic active length scale (e.g., the persistence length) is equal to
the cage length, i.e. the length scale of local particle caging. This optimal
enhancement effect is claimed to result from the most efficient scanning of
local particle cages. Here we demonstrate that this effect and its physical
explanation are fully retained for softer active spheres. We perform extensive
simulations of athermal active Brownian particles (ABPs) and show that the
non-monotonic change of the relaxation dynamics remains qualitatively similar
for varying softness. We explain quantitative differences by relating them to
the longer range of the softer interaction potential, which decreases the cage
length and obscures the intrinsic active motion. Moreover, we observe that only
when the persistence length surpasses the cage length, distinct qualitative
changes with respect to an equivalent passive Brownian particle system start to
manifest themselves. Overall, our results further strengthen the importance of
the cage length and its relation to the relevant active length scale in the
context of active glassy materials.

the spin-orbit interaction (SOI), as a possible origin of the
``chirality-induced spin selectivity'' (CISS) effect observed experimentally in
chiral molecules, such as DNA. Due to Bardarson's theorem, spin filtering
cannot be realized in a molecule containing one orbital-channel. However, when
two orbitals are involved, SOI can induce spin filtering in a molecule coupled
to two terminals without braking time-reversal symmetry. In particular, we
provide an example of a $4 \times 4$ reflection matrix for a spinful electron
passing through a molecule containing two orbital-channels, which complies with
Bardarson's theorem and produces a finite spin conductance. As a microscopic
toy model realizing a single strand of DNA, we consider a $p$-orbital helical
atomic chain with intra-atomic SOI's and a strong crystalline field along the
helix. This model exhibits two-orbital spin filtering: For various parameters
preserving the helical symmetry, the model hosts spin asymmetric states
carrying pairs of up and down spins propagating in opposite directions. The
typical energy scale of the helical states is the product of the intra-atomic
SOI and the curvature. The large value of this energy identifies our model as a
likely candidate to explain the CISS in organic molecules.

communication rate and transmit power. The multi-path propagation complicates
the expressions of the radar SINR and communication rate, leading to a

comes into play in a variety of branches of computer science. Among the various

is equivalent to counter-free omega-automata, to star-free omega-regular
expressions, and (by Kamp's theorem) to the First-Order Theory of Linear Orders
(FO-TLO). Safety and co-safety languages, where a finite prefix suffices to
establish whether a word does not belong or belongs to the language,
respectively, play a crucial role in lowering the complexity of problems like
model checking and reactive synthesis for LTL. SafetyLTL (resp., coSafetyLTL)
is a fragment of LTL where only universal (resp., existential) temporal
modalities are allowed, that recognises safety (resp., co-safety) languages
only. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a fragment of
FO-TLO, called SafetyFO, and of its dual coSafetyFO, which are expressively
complete with respect to the LTL-definable safety and co-safety languages. We
prove that they exactly characterize SafetyLTL and coSafetyLTL, respectively, a
result that joins Kamp's theorem, and provides a clearer view of the
characterization of (fragments of) LTL in terms of first-order languages. In
addition, it gives a direct, compact, and self-contained proof that any safety
language definable in LTL is definable in SafetyLTL as well. As a by-product,
we obtain some interesting results on the expressive power of the weak tomorrow

prove that, when interpreted over finite words, SafetyLTL (resp. coSafetyLTL)

arrays of the non-zero sum Heffter array that are, as the Heffter arrays,
related to difference families, graph decompositions, and biembeddings. Here we
generalize this definition to any finite groups. Given a subgroup $J$ of order
$t$ of a group $G$, a $\lambda$-fold non-zero sum Heffter array over $G$
relative to $J$, $^\lambda\mathrm{N}\mathrm{H}_t(m,n; h,k)$, is an $m \times n$
p. f. array with entries in $G$ such that: each row contains $h$ filled cells
and each column contains $k$ filled cells; for every $x\in G\setminus J$, the
sum of the occurrence of $x$ and $-x$ is $\lambda$; the sum of the elements in
every row and column is, following the natural orderings from left to right for
the rows and from top to bottom for the columns, different from $0$ (in $G$).
In [12], there was presented a complete, probabilistic, solution for the
existence problem in case $\lambda=1$ and $G=\mathbb{Z}_v$ that is the starting

prove, through local considerations (inspired by Lov\'asz Local Lemma), that
there exists a $\lambda$-fold non-zero sum Heffter array over $G$ relative to

sometimes some vertices of $G$ such that they forcedly belong to every metric

hulls of any two disjoint subfamilies can be separated by a hyperplane.
Well-separation is a strong assumption that allows us to conclude that certain
kinds of generalized ham-sandwich cuts for the point sets exist. But how hard
is it to check if a given family of high-dimensional point sets has this
property? Starting from this question, we study several algorithmic aspects of
the existence of transversals and separations in high-dimensions.
  First, we give an explicit proof that $k$ point sets are well-separated if
and only if their convex hulls admit no $(k - 2)$-transversal, i.e., if there
exists no $(k - 2)$-dimensional flat that intersects the convex hulls of all
$k$ sets. It follows that the task of checking well-separation lies in the
complexity class coNP. Next, we show that it is NP-hard to decide whether there
is a hyperplane-transversal (that is, a $(d - 1)$-transversal) of a family of
$d + 1$ line segments in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is part of the input. As a
consequence, it follows that the general problem of testing well-separation is
coNP-complete. Furthermore, we show that finding a hyperplane that maximizes
the number of intersected sets is NP-hard, but allows for an
$\Omega\left(\frac{\log k}{k \log \log k}\right)$-approximation algorithm that
is polynomial in $d$ and $k$, when each set consists of a single point. When
all point sets are finite, we show that checking whether there exists a $(k -

answered in fundamental physics today. Observations with varied astronomical
and cosmological technologies strongly indicated that DM exists in the
Universe, the Milky Way, and the Solar System. Nevertheless, understanding DM
under the language of elementary physics is still in progress. DM direct
detection tests the interactive cross-section between galactic DM particles and
an underground detector's nucleons. Although Weakly Interactive Massive
Particles (WIMPs) are the most discussed DM candidates, the null-WIMPs
conclusion has been consistently addressed by the most convincing experiments
in the field. Relatively, the low-mass WIMPs region ($\sim$ 10 MeV/c$^2$ - 10
GeV/c$^2$) has not been fully exploited compared to high-mass WIMPs ($\sim$ 10
GeV/c$^2$ - 10 TeV/c$^2$). The ALETHEIA (A Liquid hElium Time projection
cHambEr In dArk matter) experiment aims to hunt for low-mass WIMPs with liquid
helium-filled TPCs (Time Projection Chambers). In this paper, we go through the
physics motivation of the project, the detector's design, the R\&D plan, and
the progress we have made since the project has been launched in the summer of
2020.

introducing a fictitious ``time'' inducing a stochastic process described
through a Langevin equation, from which the randomness of the tensor field will

With limited qubit counts, connectivity, and coherence times, a quantum circuit
optimization is essential to make the best use of near-term quantum devices. We
introduce a new circuit optimizer called AQCEL, which aims to remove redundant
controlled operations from controlled gates, depending on initial states of the
circuit. Especially, the AQCEL can remove unnecessary qubit controls from
multi-controlled gates in polynomial computational resources, even when all the
relevant qubits are entangled, by identifying zero-amplitude computational
basis states using a quantum computer. As a benchmark, the AQCEL is deployed on
a quantum algorithm designed to model final state radiation in high energy
physics. For this benchmark, we have demonstrated that the AQCEL-optimized
circuit can produce equivalent final states with much smaller number of gates.
Moreover, when deploying AQCEL with a noisy intermediate scale quantum
computer, it efficiently produces a quantum circuit that approximates the
original circuit with high fidelity by truncating low-amplitude computational
basis states below certain thresholds. Our technique is useful for a wide
variety of quantum algorithms, opening up new possibilities to further simplify
quantum circuits to be more effective for real devices.

Parity-time (PT) symmetry, an intriguing concept originated from quantum

of the conventional readout circuit, while the PT symmetry condition has to be
satisfied. In this work, a sandwich-type wireless capacitance readout mechanism
based on perturbed PT-symmetric electronic trimer without manual tuning of the
reader circuit is proposed. Theoretical eigenvalue analysis by solving the
system equations shows that the system exhibits single real mode in weak
coupling regime whose eigenfrequency changes in response to the capacitance of
the neutral resonator. Furthermore, the proposed readout system exhibits wider
readout capacitance range compared to standard PT-symmetry-based system while
retaining higher Q-factor compared to conventional readout method, which has
been validated with the experimental prototype based on printed circuit board.
Our work not only enriches the underlying theory of non-Hermitian physics, but
also shows potential applications in scenarios where longer interrogation

and a cytoskeleton, connected by protein junction complexes, with possible
sliding. Despite this biological reality, it is most often modelled as a
one-layer capsule or as a vesicle. An alternative is to consider a two-layers
membrane, each mimicking either the lipid bilayer or the cytoskeleton. The
in-plane elastic part brought by the cytoskeleton is modelled by a continuous
constitutive law (capsule) or a discrete spring network. Considering four
regimes representing the dynamics in shear flow, we computationally asses all
the strategies with couplings such as capsule-capsule or capsule-network and
vesicle-capsule or vesicle-network. The anisotropy artificially introduced by a
discrete spring network is a source of numerical instability, especially for
the coupling with a vesicle. Though the capsule-capsule and vesicle-capsule
models show similarity in behaviour, considering fluidity and surface
incompressibility when using a vesicle to represent the bilayer is not without
consequences. Rigorous area conservation provides noticeable additional
stiffness and fluidity allows lipid recirculation. Overall, our results suggest
that modelling the membrane closer to the biological reality is more impactful
than the largely debated issue about the stress-free shape for the
cytoskeleton. Now, our results when comparing the capsule and the
capsule-capsule models in tank-treading regime providentially highlight a new
indicator of the right stress-free shape motivating new experimental
investigations.

Most popular contrastive-loss based methods like SimCLR, MoCo, MoCo-v2 use
multiple views of the same image by applying contrived augmentations on the
image to create positive pairs and contrast them with negative examples.
Although these techniques work well, most of these techniques have been tuned
on ImageNet (and similar computer vision datasets). While there have been some
attempts to capture a richer set of deformations in the positive samples, in
this work, we explore a promising alternative to generating positive examples
for remote sensing data within the contrastive learning framework. Images
captured from different sensors at the same location and nearby timestamps can
be thought of as strongly augmented instances of the same scene, thus removing
the need to explore and tune a set of hand crafted strong augmentations. In
this paper, we propose a simple dual-encoder framework, which is pre-trained on
a large unlabeled dataset (~1M) of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image pairs. We
test the embeddings on two remote sensing downstream tasks: flood segmentation
and land cover mapping, and empirically show that embeddings learnt from this
technique outperform the conventional technique of collecting positive examples
via aggressive data augmentations.

the outskirts of the galaxies. However, the role of DM might be different in
the galactic bulges and centers where Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) dominate
the gravitational interaction. Indeed, given the fact that DM is the dominant
matter species in the Universe, it is natural to assume a close connection
between DM and SMBHs. Here we probe into this possibility by constructing
stable objects with fuzzy mass distributions based on standard DM profiles.
These astrophysical objects come out in three types: a fuzzy droplet without
horizon and fuzzy Black Holes (BHs) with one or two horizons. We emphasize that
all objects are solutions of Einstein equations. Their effective potentials
which govern the motion of a test body, can display a reasonable similarity to
the effective potential of a Schwarzschild BH at the galactic center.
Therefore, some of our solutions could, in principle, replace the standard
BH-picture of the galactic center and, at the same time, have the advantage
that they have been composed of the main matter ingredient of the Universe.

the magnetic properties of the rhombohedral MX$_{3}$ (M: V, Cr, Mn, and Fe. X:
Cl, Br, and I) van der Waals materials with centrosymmetric lattice by
combining first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We found
that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector acting between the second nearest
neighbor sites of the intra-layer is non-zero and quite large even in MX$_{3}$
due to the breaking of the local inversion symmetry. We have found that the
large DMI causes nano-scale magnetic vortexes, so-called skyrmions in MX$_{3}$.
The diameter of skyrmions, e.g., in CrCl$_{3}$, is small, i.e., 2 nm, which is
promising for the application of high-density magnetic memory devices. We have
also found that not only conventional skyrmions in CrCl$_{3}$ and VCl$_{3}$ but
also antiferromagnetic skyrmions in FeCl$_{3}$ and meron in MnCl$_{3}$ appear.
Furthermore, we have found that the skyrmions in ClCl$_{3}$ and VCl$_{3}$ have
a different helicity, which shows the possibility of controlling the helicity
by electron/hole doping in MX$_{3}$ materials. Van der Waals materials, which

such as segmentation, object tracking, and event detection. To train an object
detector with satisfactory accuracy, a large amount of data is required.
However, due to the intensive workforce involved with annotating large
datasets, such a data curation task is often outsourced to a third party or
relied on volunteers. This work reveals severe vulnerabilities of such data
curation pipeline. We propose MACAB that crafts clean-annotated images to
stealthily implant the backdoor into the object detectors trained on them even
when the data curator can manually audit the images. We observe that the
backdoor effect of both misclassification and the cloaking are robustly
achieved in the wild when the backdoor is activated with inconspicuously
natural physical triggers. Backdooring non-classification object detection with
clean-annotation is challenging compared to backdooring existing image
classification tasks with clean-label, owing to the complexity of having
multiple objects within each frame, including victim and non-victim objects.
The efficacy of the MACAB is ensured by constructively i abusing the
image-scaling function used by the deep learning framework, ii incorporating
the proposed adversarial clean image replica technique, and iii combining
poison data selection criteria given constrained attacking budget. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MACAB exhibits more than 90% attack success rate
under various real-world scenes. This includes both cloaking and
misclassification backdoor effect even restricted with a small attack budget.
The poisoned samples cannot be effectively identified by state-of-the-art
detection techniques.The comprehensive video demo is at

endogenous investment decisions, leading to a joint solution. We apply the
method to Germany in a proof-of-concept study using the IAM REMIND and the PSM
DIETER, and confirm the theoretical prediction of almost-full convergence both
in terms of decision variables and (shadow) prices. At the end of the iterative
process, the absolute model difference between the generation shares of any
generator type for any year is <5% for a simple configuration (no storage, no
flexible demand), and 6-7% for a more realistic and detailed configuration
(with storage and flexible demand). For the simple configuration, we
mathematically show that this coupling scheme corresponds uniquely to an
iterative mapping of the Lagrangians of two power sector optimization problems
of different time resolutions, which can lead to a comprehensive model
convergence of both decision variables and (shadow) prices. Since our approach
is based on fundamental economic principles, it is applicable also to other
IAM-PSM pairs.

  Models",,,,,"cs.LG cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large transformer models display promising performance on a wide range of
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Although the AI community has expanded
the model scale to the trillion parameter level, the practical deployment of
10-100 billion parameter models is still uncertain due to the latency,
throughput, and memory constraints.
  In this paper, we proposed EnergonAI to solve the challenges of the efficient
deployment of 10-100 billion parameter transformer models on single- or
multi-GPU systems. EnergonAI adopts a hierarchy-controller system architecture
to coordinate multiple devices and efficiently support different parallel
patterns. It delegates the execution of sub-models to multiple workers in the
single-controller style and applies tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism
among the workers in a multi-controller style. Upon the novel architecture, we
propose three techniques, i.e. non-blocking pipeline parallelism, distributed
redundant computation elimination, and peer memory pooling. EnergonAI enables
the users to program complex parallel code the same as a serial one. Compared
with the FasterTransformer, we have proven that EnergonAI has superior
performance on latency and throughput. In our experiments, EnergonAI can
achieve 37% latency reduction in tensor parallelism, 10% scalability
improvement in pipeline parallelism, and it improves the model scale inferred
on a single GPU by using a larger heterogeneous memory space at cost of limited
performance reduction.

approximated by a computational domain that typically does not coincide with a

estimates of a numerical method domain-related discretization errors, the
so-called variational crimes, need to be taken into account. In this paper we
present an elegant alternative to a direct, but rather technical, analysis of
variational crimes by means of the penalty approach. We embed the physical
domain into a large enough cubed domain and study the convergence of a finite
volume method for the corresponding domain-penalized problem. We show that
numerical solutions of the penalized problem converge to a generalized, the
so-called dissipative weak, solution of the original problem. If a strong
solution exists, the dissipative weak solution emanating from the same initial

the relative energy and derive the error estimates between the numerical

cause economic and ecological damage. This phenomenon depends on a variety of
biological and physical factors. The complexity and practical importance of the
issue have made the problem of predicting outbreaks a focus of recent research.
Here, we propose the Pattern-Based Prediction (PBP) method for predicting
population outbreaks. It is based on the Alert Zone Procedure, combined with
elements from machine learning. It uses information on previous time series
values that precede an outbreak event as predictors of future outbreaks, which
can be useful when monitoring pest species. We illustrate the methodology using
simulated datasets and real time series data obtained by monitoring aphids in
wheat crops in Southern Brazil. We obtained an average test accuracy of
$84.6\%$ in the simulation studies implemented with stochastic models, and
$95.0\%$ for predicting outbreaks using the real dataset. This shows the
feasibility of the PBP method in predicting outbreaks in population dynamics.
We benchmarked our results against established state-of-the-art machine
learning methods, namely Support Vector Machines, Deep Neural Networks, Long
Short Term Memory and Random Forests. The PBP method yielded a competitive
performance, associated with higher true-positive rates in most comparisons,
while being able to provide interpretability rather than being a black-box
method. This is an improvement over current state-of-the-art machine learning
tools, especially when being used by non-specialists, such as ecologists aiming
to use a quantitative approach for pest monitoring. We provide open-source code
to implement the PBP method in Python, through the \texttt{pypbp} package,

been one of the major tasks in topological physics. Currently, bulk-boundary
correspondence based on spectral measurements of in gap topological boundary
states and the fractional corner anomaly derived from the measurement of the
fractional spectral charge are two main approaches to characterize
topologically insulating phases. However, these two methods require a complete
band-gap with either in-gap states or strict spatial symmetry of the overall
sample which significantly limits their applications to more generalized cases.
Here we propose and demonstrate an approach to link the non-trivial
hierarchical bulk topology to the multidimensional partition of local-density
of states (LDOS) respectively, denoted as the bulk-LDOS correspondence.
Specifically, in a finite-size topologically nontrivial photonic crystal, we
observe that the distribution of LDOS is divided into three partitioned regions
of the sample - the two-dimensional interior bulk area (avoiding edge and
corner areas), one-dimensional edge region (avoiding the corner area), and
zero-dimensional corner sites. In contrast, the LDOS is distributed across the
entire two-dimensional bulk area across the whole spectrum for the
topologically trivial cases. Moreover, we present the universality of this
criterion by validating this correspondence in both a higher-order topological
insulator without a complete band gap and with disorders. Our findings provide
a general way to distinguish topological insulators and unveil the unexplored
features of topological directional band-gap materials without in-gap states.

via the general relativistic instability. The growth and collapse of the cores
occurs within $\sim 5\times 10^5$ yr from the formation of the SMD, producing
bright electromagnetic, neutrino and gravitational wave transients with a
typical duration of a few minutes and, respectively, a typical flux and a
typical strain amplitude at Earth of $\sim 10^{-8}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and
$\sim4\times 10^{-21}$. We provide a simple fitting formula for the the
resulting black hole masses, which range from a few $10^6$ M$_{\odot}$ to
$10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ depending on the initial SMD configuration. Crucially, our
analysis does not require any specific assumption on the thermal properties of
the gas, nor on the angular momentum loss mechanisms within the SMD. Led by
these findings, we argue that the merger-driven scenario provides a robust
pathway for the rapid formation of supermassive black holes at $z > 6$. It
provides an explanation for the origin of the brightest and oldest quasars
without the need of a sustained growth phase from a much smaller seed. Its
smoking gun signatures can be tested directly via multi-messenger observations.

  expansion modeling results when dis-aggregated at high resolution?","Preprint submitted to Elsevier",,,,"cs.CE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Spatially highly-resolved capacity expansion models are computationally
intensive. As a result, models are often simplified to a lower spatial
resolution by clustering multiple regions to a smaller number of
representatives. However, when capacity expansion is modeled for electricity
systems at a coarse resolution, the aggregation mixes sites with different
renewable features while removing transmission lines that can cause congestion.
As a consequence, the modeling results may represent an infeasible electricity
system when the capacities are fed back into higher spatial detail. Thus far
there has been no detailed investigation of how best to dis-aggregate the
capacity expansion results into its original resolution and whether the
spatially highly-resolved dis-aggregated model is technically feasible. This is
a challenge since there is no unique or obvious way to invert the clustering.
In this paper we proceed in two stages. First, we propose three methods to
dis-aggregate spatially low-resolved model results into higher resolution: (a)
uniformly distribute the regionalised results across their original set of
regions, (b) re-optimising each clustered region separately at high resolution
(c) a novel approach that minimises the custom ""excess electricity"" function.
Second, we investigate the resulting highly-resolved models' feasibility by
running an operational dispatch. While re-optimising yields the lowest amounts
of load-shedding and curtailment, our novel inverse-method provides comparable
results for considerably less computational effort. Feasibility-wise, our
results strengthen previously published research that modeling every country by
a single region is insufficient. Beyond that, we find that results obtained
from state-of-the-art reduced models with 100-200 regions for Europe still
yield 3-7% of load-shedding, depending on the model resolution and inverse
method.

we studied the infrared colors of all point sources coinciding within the

pre-main sequence stars lacking infrared counterparts with Swift-XRT, and found
no candidates down to a luminosity level $\lesssim 10^{31}$erg cm$^{-1}$ in the

truly unique insight into a primordial form of the interstellar medium. Based

amplitudes and on the width and depth (height) of the radial electric field
well-like (hill-like) profile. We find that, as the depth (height) increases,
the STB at the plasma edge becomes more resistant to fluctuations, enabling
access to an improved confinement regime that prevents chaotic transport. We
also present parameter spaces with the radial electric field parameters,
indicating the STB existence for several electric field configurations at the
plasma edge, for which we obtain a fractal structure at the barrier/non-barrier
frontier, typical of quasi-integrable Hamiltonian systems.

(unsteady turbulent flow). Within this clustered region, we increase the
polynomial order to show that it is possible to obtain similar levels of
accuracy to a uniformly refined mesh. The method is effective as the clustering
successfully identifies the two flow regions, a viscous/turbulent dominated
region (including the boundary layer and wake) and an inviscid/irrotational
region (a potential flow region). The data used within this framework are
generated using a high-order discontinuous Galerkin solver, allowing to locally
refine the polynomial order (p-refinement) in each element of the clustered
region. For the steady laminar test case we are able to reduce the
computational cost up to 32% and for the unsteady turbulent case up to 33%.

understanding their evolution. The quenching of star formation via strong UV
radiation (from starbursts or AGN) has been proposed in various scenes to solve
certain astrophysical problems. Around luminous sources, some evidence of
decreased star formation has been found but is limited to a handful of
individual cases. No direct, conclusive evidence on the actual role of strong
UV radiation in quenching star formation has been found. Here we present
statistical evidence of decreased number density of faint (AB magnitude $\geq$
24.75 mag) Ly\alpha emitters (LAEs) around bright (AB magnitude < 24.75 mag)
LAEs even when the radius goes up to 10 pMpc for $z$ $\simeq$ 5.7 LAEs. A
similar trend is found for z $\simeq$ 6.6 LAEs but only within 1 pMpc radius
from the bright LAEs. We use a large sample of 1077 (962) LAEs at $z$ $\simeq$
5.7 ($z$ $\simeq$ 6.6) selected in total areas of 14 (21) deg$^2$ with
Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam narrow-band data, and thus, the result is of
statistical significance for the first time at these high redshift ranges. A
simple analytical calculation indicates that the radiation from the central LAE
is not enough to suppress LAEs with AB mag $\geq$ 24.75 mag around them,
suggesting additional physical mechanisms we are unaware of are at work. Our
results clearly show that the environment is at work for the galaxy formation

invertible precisely when this mapping is injective, such that the initial

  While invertible algorithms can be described in general-purpose languages, no

ensuring invertibility requires additional (and often non-trivial) proof. On
the other hand, while reversible programming languages guarantee that their
programs are invertible by restricting the permissible operations to those

cumbersome, and may differ significantly from conventional implementations even
when the implemented algorithm is, in fact, invertible.
  In this paper we introduce Jeopardy, a functional programming language that
guarantees program invertibility without imposing local reversibility. In
particular, Jeopardy allows the limited use of uninvertible -- and even
nondeterministic! -- operations, provided that they are used in a way that can
be statically determined to be invertible. To this end, we outline an

perform a given task in an environment using example trajectories provided by
an expert. In the real world, one might have access to expert trajectories in
different environments where the system dynamics is different while the
learning task is the same. For such scenarios, two types of learning objectives
can be defined. One where the learned policy performs very well in one specific
environment and another when it performs well across all environments. To
balance these two objectives in a principled way, our work presents the cross
apprenticeship learning (CAL) framework. This consists of an optimization
problem where an optimal policy for each environment is sought while ensuring
that all policies remain close to each other. This nearness is facilitated by
one tuning parameter in the optimization problem. We derive properties of the
optimizers of the problem as the tuning parameter varies. Since the problem is
nonconvex, we provide a convex outer approximation. Finally, we demonstrate the
attributes of our framework in the context of a navigation task in a windy

targets for exploring the evolution of planetary systems after the red giant
branch (RGB). Thus far, no planets have been confirmed around them, and no
systematic survey to find planets has been carried out. Aims. In this project,
we aim to perform a systematic transit survey in all light curves of hot
subdwarfs from space-based telescopes (Kepler, K2, TESS, and CHEOPS). The goal
is to compute meaningful statistics on two points: firstly, the occurrence
rates of planets around hot subdwarfs, and secondly, the probability of
survival for close-in planets engulfed during the RGB phase of their host. This
paper focuses on the analysis of the observations carried out during cycle 1 of
the TESS mission. Methods. We used our specifically designed pipeline SHERLOCK
to search for transits in the available light curves. When a signal is
detected, it is processed in the next evaluating stages before an object is
qualified for follow-up observations and in-depth analysis to determine the
nature of the transiting body. Results. We applied our method to the 792 hot
subdwarfs observed during cycle 1 of TESS. While 378 interesting signals were
detected in the light curves, only 26 stars were assigned for follow-up
observations. We have identified a series of eclipsing binaries, transiting
white dwarfs, and other types of false positives, but no planet has been
confirmed thus far. A first computation of the upper limit for occurrence rates
was made with the 549 targets displaying no signal. Conclusions. The tools and
method we developed proved their efficiency in analysing the available light
curves from space missions, from detecting an interesting signal to identifying
a transiting planet. This will allow us to fulfil the two main goals of this
project.

vector representation system of assembly code and the accuracy of the
annotation of function pairs. Supervised learning based methods are
traditionally emploied. But annotating different function pairs with accurate
labels is very difficult. These supervised learning methods are easily
overtrained and suffer from vector robustness issues. To mitigate these
problems, we propose Fun2Vec: a contrastive learning framework of
function-level representation for binary. We take an unsupervised learning
approach and formulate the binary code similarity detection as instance
discrimination. Fun2Vec works directly on disassembled binary functions, and
could be implemented with any encoder. It does not require manual labeled
similar or dissimilar information. We use the compiler optimization options and
code obfuscation techniques to generate augmented data. Our experimental
results demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art in accuracy
and have great advantage in few-shot settings.

also found a significant correlation between optical flux and $\gamma$-ray flux

PD variations in our study cannot be explained by changes in the power-law

the anti-correlation can be explained by the presence of multi-zone emission

Radiation from
such objects is expected to be highly polarized due to birefringence of plasma
and vacuum associated with propagation of photons in presence of the strong
magnetic field. Here we present results of the observations of Cen X-3
performed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. The source exhibited
significant flux variability and was observed in two states different by a
factor of ~20 in flux. In the low-luminosity state no significant polarization
was found either in pulse phase-averaged (with the 3$\sigma$ upper limit of
12%) or phase-resolved data (the 3$\sigma$ upper limits are 20-30%). In the
bright state the polarization degree of 5.8$\pm$0.3% and polarization angle of
$49.6\deg\pm1.5\deg$ with significance of about 20$\sigma$ was measured from
the spectro-polarimetric analysis of the phase-averaged data. The
phase-resolved analysis showed a significant anti-correlation between the flux
and the polarization degree as well as strong variations of the polarization
angle. The fit with the rotating vector model indicates a position angle of the
pulsar spin axis of about 49$\deg$ and a magnetic obliquity of 17$\deg$. The
detected relatively low polarization can be explained if the upper layers of
the neutron star surface are overheated by the accreted matter and the
conversion of the polarization modes occurs within the transition region
between the upper hot layer and a cooler underlying atmosphere. A fraction of
polarization signal can also be produced by reflection of radiation from the
neutron star surface and the accretion curtain.

future states of the system being controlled and estimates the optimal control
inputs that drive the predicted states to the required reference. The
computations of the MPC are performed at pre-determined sample instances over a
finite time horizon. The number of sample instances and the horizon length
determine the performance of the MPC and its computational cost. A long horizon
with a large sample count allows the MPC to better estimate the inputs when the
states have rapid changes over time, which results in better performance but at
the expense of high computational cost. However, this long horizon is not
always necessary, especially for slowly-varying states. In this case, a short
horizon with less sample count is preferable as the same MPC performance can be
obtained but at a fraction of the computational cost. In this paper, we propose
an adaptive regression-based MPC that predicts the best minimum horizon length
and the sample count from several features extracted from the time-varying
changes of the states. The proposed technique builds a synthetic dataset using
the system model and utilizes the dataset to train a support vector regressor
that performs the prediction. The proposed technique is experimentally compared
with several state-of-the-art techniques on both linear and non-linear models.
The proposed technique shows a superior reduction in computational time with a
reduction of about 35-65\% compared with the other techniques without
introducing a noticeable loss in performance.

are shown to be affected by emergent topological quantum domains which, in some

  We propose the notion of the instance-based attack. Our scheme is
interpretable and can work in a black-box environment. Given a specific binary
example and a malware classifier, we use the data augmentation strategies to
produce enough data from which we can train a simple interpretable model. We
explain the detection model by displaying the weight of different parts of the
specific binary. By analyzing the explanations, we found that the data
subsections play an important role in Windows PE malware detection. We proposed
a new function preserving transformation algorithm that can be applied to data
subsections. By employing the binary-diversification techniques that we
proposed, we eliminated the influence of the most weighted part to generate
adversarial examples. Our algorithm can fool the DNNs in certain cases with a
success rate of nearly 100\%. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
method . The most important aspect is that our method operates in black-box

only has access to positive and unlabeled samples while having no information
on negative examples. Such PU setting is of great importance in various tasks
such as medical diagnosis, social network analysis, financial markets analysis,
and knowledge base completion, which also tend to be intrinsically imbalanced,
i.e., where most examples are actually negatives. Most existing approaches for
PU learning, however, only consider artificially balanced datasets and it is
unclear how well they perform in the realistic scenario of imbalanced and
long-tail data distribution. This paper proposes to tackle this challenge via
robust and efficient self-supervised pretraining. However, training
conventional self-supervised learning methods when applied with highly
imbalanced PU distribution needs better reformulation. In this paper, we
present \textit{ImPULSeS}, a unified representation learning framework for
\underline{Im}balanced \underline{P}ositive \underline{U}nlabeled
\underline{L}earning leveraging \underline{Se}lf-\underline{S}upervised debiase
pre-training. ImPULSeS uses a generic combination of large-scale unsupervised
learning with debiased contrastive loss and additional reweighted PU loss. We
performed different experiments across multiple datasets to show that ImPULSeS
is able to halve the error rate of the previous state-of-the-art, even compared
with previous methods that are given the true prior. Moreover, our method
showed increased robustness to prior misspecification and superior performance
even when pretraining was performed on an unrelated dataset. We anticipate such
robustness and efficiency will make it much easier for practitioners to obtain
excellent results on other PU datasets of interest. The source code is

discrete-valued states (DV) and continuous-valued states (CV) presented a
particular challenge in quantum technologies. Here we consider the problem of
controlled quantum teleportation of an amplitude-matched CV qubit, encoded by a
coherent state of a varied phase as a superposition of the vacuum- and
single-photon optical states among two distant partners Alice and Bob, with the
consent of controller, Charlie. To achieve this task, we use an hybrid
tripartite entangled state (interaction between the discrete and continuous
variables states) as the quantum resource where the coherent part belongs to
Alice, while the single-photon belongs to Bob and Charlie and the CV qubit is
at the disposal of Alice. The discrete-continuous interaction is realized on
highly transmissive beam-splitter. We have shown that the perfectly of
teleportation fidelity depends on the phase difference between the phase of the
state to teleport and the phase of the sender's mode, we found that for a
difference which approaches 0 or $\pi$, near perfect controlled quantum
teleportation can be obtained in terms of the fidelity and independently of the
amplitude $\alpha$ and the squeezing parameter $\zeta$. Experimentally, this
proposed scheme has been implemented using linear optical components such as
beam splitter, phase shifters and photon counters.

field, two main tasks of word sense alignment and translation inference are
addressed. The first task aims to find an optimal alignment given the sense
definitions of a headword in two different monolingual dictionaries. This is a
challenging task, especially due to differences in sense granularity, coverage
and description in two resources. After describing the characteristics of
various lexical semantic resources, we introduce a benchmark containing 17
datasets of 15 languages where monolingual word senses and definitions are
manually annotated across different resources by experts. In the creation of
the benchmark, lexicographers' knowledge is incorporated through the
annotations where a semantic relation, namely exact, narrower, broader, related
or none, is selected for each sense pair. This benchmark can be used for
evaluation purposes of word-sense alignment systems. The performance of a few
alignment techniques based on textual and non-textual semantic similarity
detection and semantic relation induction is evaluated using the benchmark.
Finally, we extend this work to translation inference where translation pairs
are induced to generate bilingual lexicons in an unsupervised way using various
approaches based on graph analysis. This task is of particular interest for the
creation of lexicographical resources for less-resourced and under-represented
languages and also, assists in increasing coverage of the existing resources.
From a practical point of view, the techniques and methods that are developed

deformations of nearly incompressible materials such as water, rubber, and
undrained porous media. However, MPM solutions to nearly incompressible
materials are susceptible to volumetric locking, that is, overly stiff behavior
with erroneous strain and stress fields. While several approaches have been
devised to mitigate volumetric locking in MPM, they require significant
modifications of the existing MPM machinery, often being tailored to certain
basis functions or material types. In this work, we propose a
locking-mitigation approach that features an unprecedented combination of
simplicity, efficacy, and generality for a family of explicit MPM formulations.
The approach combines the assumed deformation gradient ($\bar{\boldsymbol{F}}$)
method with a volume-averaging operation built on the standard particle--grid
transfer scheme in MPM. Upon explicit time integration, this combination yields
a new and simple algorithm for updating the deformation gradient, preserving
all other MPM procedures. The proposed approach is thus easy to implement,
low-cost, and compatible with the existing machinery in MPM. Through various
types of nearly incompressible problems in solid and fluid mechanics, we verify
that the proposed approach efficiently circumvents volumetric locking in
explicit MPM, regardless of the basis functions and material types.

and decays of nuclei across the entire chart of nuclides is an enormous
challenge because of the experimental difficulties in measuring properties of
interest in such fleeting objects and the theoretical and computational issues
of simulating strongly-interacting quantum many-body systems. Nuclear density
functional theory (DFT) is a fully microscopic theoretical framework which has
the potential of providing such a quantitatively accurate description of
nuclear properties for every nucleus in the chart of nuclides. Thanks to
high-performance computing facilities, it has already been successfully applied
to predict nuclear masses, global patterns of radioactive decay like $\beta$ or
$\gamma$ decay, and several aspects of the nuclear fission process such as,
e.g., spontaneous fission half-lives. Yet, predictive simulations of nuclear
spectroscopy or of nuclear fission, or the quantification of theoretical
uncertainties and their propagation to applications, would require several
orders of magnitude more calculations than currently possible. However, most of
this computational effort would be spent into generating a suitable basis of
DFT wavefunctions. Such a task could potentially be considerably accelerated by
borrowing tools from the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
In this paper, we review different approaches to applying supervised and

transition between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic order is largely

nucleation, we find that metamagnetism is largely preserved in nanomagnet
arrays formed through solid-state dewetting. This behavior is strongly
dependent on the resulting crystal faceting of the nanoislands, which is
characteristic of each assembly route. Comparing the calculated surface
energies for each magnetic phase of the nanoislands reveals that metamagnetism
can be suppressed or allowed by specific geometrical configurations of the
facets. Furthermore, we find that the spatial confinement leads to very
pronounced supercooling and the absence of phase separation in the nanoislands.
Finally, the supported nanomagnets are chemically etched away from the

used towards high angular resolution observations of stars in visible
wavelengths. In these proceedings, we present recent technical improvements to
the instrument, and share results from ongoing campaigns using arrays of small
diameter optical telescopes. A tip-tilt adaptive optics unit was integrated
into the optical system to stabilize light injection into an optical fiber. The
setup was successfully tested with several facilities on the Calern Plateau
site of the Observatoire de la C\^ote d'Azur. These include one of the 1 m
diameter telescopes of the C2PU observatory, a portable 1 m diameter telescope,
and also the 1.5 m M\'eO telescope. To better constrain on-sky measurements,
the spectral transmission of instrument was characterized in the laboratory
using a high resolution spectrograph. The system was also tested with two of
the auxiliary telescopes of the VLTI resulting in successful temporal and
spatial correlation measurements of three stars.

  GPU",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Larger deep learning models usually lead to higher model quality with an
ever-increasing GPU memory footprint. Although tensor checkpointing techniques
have been proposed to enable training under a restricted GPU memory budget, the
input tensor dynamics have been unexploited for optimizing performance while
reducing GPU memory footprint. Specifically, due to the diverse datasets and
subsequent data argumentation, the input tensor size per mini-batch is dynamic
during the training process, leading to a changing GPU memory footprint.
However, to leverage such input tensor dynamics in checkpointing, there are two
challenges to be solved. First, the checkpointing plan needs to be determined
during runtime due to the dynamics of input tensors. Second, the checkpointing
plan needs to be applied on the fly without significantly deteriorating the
performance.
  In this paper, we propose Mimose, an input-aware tensor checkpointing planner
respecting the memory budget while enabling efficient model training on GPU.
Mimose builds a lightweight but accurate prediction model of GPU memory usage
online, without pre-analyzing the model. It generates a tensor checkpointing
plan based on per-layer memory prediction and applies it to training progress
on the fly. It also adopts a caching strategy to avoid having to regenerate the
plan for repeated input size. Our experiments show that Mimose achieves
superior training throughput compared to state-of-the-art memory planners under
the same GPU memory budgets.

quantum information and quantum communication. In addition, compared to
Hermitian quantum systems, parity-time-($\mathcal{PT}$-)symmetric non-Hermitian
quantum systems exhibit novel phenomena and have attracted considerable
attention. Here, we experimentally demonstrate QSD in a
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system (i.e., $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric QSD), by having
quantum states evolve under a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonian in a lossy
linear optical setup. We observe that two initially nonorthogonal states can
rapidly evolve into orthogonal states, and the required evolution time can even
be vanishing provided the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian become
sufficiently large. We also observe that the cost of such a discrimination is a
dissipation of quantum states into the environment. Furthermore, by comparing
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric QSD with optimal strategies in Hermitian systems, we
find that at the critical value, $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric QSD is equivalent to
the optimal unambiguous state discrimination in Hermitian systems. We also
extend the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric QSD to the case of discriminating three
nonorthogonal states. The QSD in a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system opens a new
door for quantum state discrimination, which has important applications in
quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication.

close-orbiting gas giants, and can result in time-dependent transmission
spectra. We aim to examine the impact of a variety of flares, differing in
energy, duration, and occurrence frequency, on the composition and spectra of
close-orbiting, tidally locked gaseous planets with climates dominated by
equatorial superrotation. We used a series of pseudo-2D photo- and
thermochemical kinetics models, which take advection by the equatorial jet
stream into account, to simulate the neutral molecular composition of a gaseous
planet (effective temperature 800 K) that orbits a flaring M dwarf. We then
computed transmission spectra for the evening and morning limb. We find that
the upper regions of the dayside and evening limb are heavily depleted in CH4
and NH3 up to several days after a flare with a total radiative energy of $ 2
\times 10^{33} $ erg. Molar fractions of C2H2 and HCN are enhanced up to a
factor three on the nightside and morning limb after day-to-nightside advection
of photodissociated species. CH4 depletion reduces transit depths by 100-300
parts per million (ppm) on the evening limb and C2H2 production increases the
14 micron feature up to 350 ppm on the morning limb. We find that repeated
flaring drives the atmosphere to a composition that differs from its pre-flare
distribution and that this translates to a permanent modification of the
transmission spectrum. We show that single high-energy flares can affect the
atmospheres of close-orbiting gas giants up to several days after the flare
event, during which their transmission spectra are altered by several hundred
ppm. Repeated flaring has important implications for future retrieval analyses
of exoplanets around active stars, as the atmospheric composition and resulting
spectral signatures substantially differ from models that do not include
flaring.

astrophysics studies and cosmology. A large number of unidentified sources are
being detected by the large field-of-view continuum instruments operating on
large telescopes.
  Aims. New smart focal planes are needed to bridge the gap between large
bandwidth continuum instruments operating on single dish telescopes and the
high spectral and angular resolution interferometers (e.g. ALMA in Chile, NOEMA
in France). The aim is to perform low-medium spectral resolution observations
and select a lower number of potentially interesting sources, i.e.
high-redshift galaxies, for further follow-up.
  Methods. We have designed, fabricated and tested an innovative on-chip
spectrometer sensitive in the 85-110~GHz range. It contains sixteen channels
selecting a frequency band of about 0.2 GHz each. A conical horn antenna
coupled to a slot in the ground plane collects the radiation and guides it to a
mm-wave microstrip transmission line placed on the other side of the
mono-crystalline substrate. The mm-wave line is coupled to a filter-bank. Each
filter is capacitively coupled to a Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detector
(LEKID). The microstrip configuration allows to benefit from the high quality,
i.e. low losses, mono-crystalline substrate, and at the same time prevents
direct, i.e. un-filtered, LEKID illumination.
  Results. The prototype spectrometer exhibit a spectral resolution R = lambda
/ Delta_lambda = 300. The optical noise equivalent power is in the low
1E-16W/sqrt(Hz) range for an incoming power of about 0.2pW per channel. The
device is polarisation-sensitive, with a cross-polarisation lower than 1% for
the best channels.

extracts high-level commonsense knowledge from large language models (such as
GPT-3), and applies them to perform 3D reasoning of human-object interactions.
Our key insight is priors extracted from large language models can help in
reasoning about human-object contacts from textural prompts only. We
quantitatively evaluate the inferred 3D models on a large human-object
interaction dataset and show how our method leads to better 3D reconstructions.
We further qualitatively evaluate the effectiveness of our method on real
images and demonstrate its generalizability towards interaction types and

HC$^{17}$O$^+$ $J =$1-0 observations towards the dust peak in L1544. We
observed the HC$^{17}$O$^+$ (1-0) spectrum with the Institut de Radioastronomie
Millim\'etrique (IRAM) 30m telescope. By using new state-of-the-art collisional
rate coefficients, a physical model for the core and the fractional abundance
profile of HC$^{17}$O$^+$, the hyperfine structure of this molecular ion is
modelled for the first time with the radiative transfer code LOC applied to the
predicted chemical structure of a contracting pre-stellar core. We applied the
same analysis to the chemically related C$^{17}$O molecule. The observed
HC$^{17}$O$^+$(1-0) and C$^{17}$O(1-0) lines have been successfully reproduced
with a non-local thermal equilibrium (LTE) radiative transfer model applied to
chemical model predictions for a contracting pre-stellar core. An upscaled
velocity profile (by 30%) is needed to reproduce the HC$^{17}$O$^+$(1-0)
observations. The double peaks observed in the HC$^{17}$O$^+$(1-0) hyperfine
components are due to the contraction motions at densities close to the
critical density of the transition ($\sim$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) and to the fact
that the HCO$^{+}$ fractional abundance decreases toward the centre.

actuator through experiments, finite element simulations, and analytical
models. We then leverage these results to predict the mechanical response of
the entire star, optimize its geometry, and maximize contraction and stiffness.
We demonstrate that the gripping force can be increased by stacking multiple
stars in a rigid frame. We expect that the flexibility, robustness, scalability

lighter and larger actuators capable of developing higher forces and moving

equator with an R=512 spectrometer over the frequency range \nu=420-540 GHz,
targeting emission of the [CII] line over redshifts 2.5<z<3.5 and several CO
lines for z<1. Cross-correlation with galaxy redshift catalogs isolates line
emission from the large-scale structure at target redshifts. In this paper, we
forecast the sensitivity for both the two-point and conditional one-point
cross-correlation. We predict that EXCLAIM will detect both the [CII]-QSO
cross-power spectrum and the conditional voxel intensity distribution (CVID) at
various redshifts under a broad range of [CII] intensity models, allowing it to
differentiate among these models in the literature. These forecasts for the
power spectra include the effects of line interlopers and continuum foreground
contamination. We then convert the joint [CII] constraints from both the
cross-power spectrum and the CVID into constraints on the [CII] halo
luminosity-mass relation $L_\mathrm{[CII]}(M)$ model parameters and the star
formation rate density (SFRD) from [CII] emission. We also develop sensitivity
estimates for CO, showing the ability to differentiate between models.

MMV_Im2Im is designed with a generic image-to-image transformation framework
that can be used for a wide range of tasks, including semantic segmentation,
instance segmentation, image restoration, and image generation, etc.. Our
implementation takes advantage of state-of-the-art machine learning engineering
techniques, allowing researchers to focus on their research without worrying
about engineering details. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MMV_Im2Im on
more than ten different biomedical problems, showcasing its general potentials
and applicabilities. For computational biomedical researchers, MMV_Im2Im
provides a starting point for developing new biomedical image analysis or
machine learning algorithms, where they can either reuse the code in this
package or fork and extend this package to facilitate the development of new
methods. Experimental biomedical researchers can benefit from this work by
gaining a comprehensive view of the image-to-image transformation concept
through diversified examples and use cases. We hope this work can give the
community inspirations on how DL-based image-to-image transformation can be
integrated into the assay development process, enabling new biomedical studies

enabling the rapid recovery and loss mitigation of microservice applications in
the cloud. Depending on the granularity of the causes that can be localized, a
service operator may take different actions, e.g., restarting or migrating
services if only faulty services can be localized (namely, coarse-grained) or
scaling resources if specific indicative metrics on the faulty service can be
localized (namely, fine-grained). Prior research mainly focuses on
coarse-grained faulty service localization, and there is now a growing interest
in fine-grained root cause localization to identify faulty services and
metrics. Causal inference (CI) based methods have gained popularity recently
for root cause localization, but currently used CI methods have limitations,
such as the linear causal relations assumption and strict data distribution
requirements. To tackle these challenges, we propose a framework named
CausalRCA to implement fine-grained, automated, and real-time root cause
localization. The CausalRCA uses a gradient-based causal structure learning
method to generate weighted causal graphs and a root cause inference method to
localize root cause metrics. We conduct coarse- and fine-grained root cause
localization to evaluate the localization performance of CausalRCA.
Experimental results show that CausalRCA has significantly outperformed
baseline methods in localization accuracy, e.g., the average AC@3 of the
fine-grained root cause metric localization in the faulty service is 0.719, and
the average increase is 10% compared with baseline methods. In addition, the
average Avg@5 has improved by 9.43%.

difference in the position of tip red giant branch (TRGB). The C/M ratios are
obtained after precise and consistent categorization. Although for galaxies
with larger distance modulo there is greater uncertainty, the C/M ratio is
clearly found to decrease with the color index $(J - K)_0$ of TRGB as the
indicator of metallicity, which agrees with previous studies and can be
explained by the fact that carbon stars are more easily formed in a metal-poor

galactocentric distance, which coincides with this scenario and the galactic

to decrease with galactocentric radius, which deserves further study.

supervisory information by either refining the affinity matrix or directly
constraining the low-dimensional representations of data points. The affinity

static affinity matrix to learn the low-dimensional representations of data

this paper, we propose a novel dynamic graph structure learning method for

leveraging the given pairwise constraints. Moreover, we propose an alternating
minimization approach with proven convergence to solve the proposed nonconvex

low-dimensional representations of data points and refines the affinity matrix,
leading to a dynamic affinity matrix (graph structure). Specifically, for the
update of the affinity matrix, we enforce the data points with remarkably
different low-dimensional representations to have an affinity value of 0.
Furthermore, we construct the initial affinity matrix by integrating the local
distance and global self-representation among data points. Experimental results

additional side information, e.g., another image from a different perspective
of the same scene. To better utilize the side information under the distributed
compression scenario, the existing method (Ayzik and Avidan 2020) only
implements patch matching at the image domain to solve the parallax problem
caused by the difference in viewing points. However, the patch matching at the
image domain is not robust to the variance of scale, shape, and illumination
caused by the different viewing angles, and can not make full use of the rich
texture information of the side information image. To resolve this issue, we
propose Multi-Scale Feature Domain Patch Matching (MSFDPM) to fully utilizes
side information at the decoder of the distributed image compression model.
Specifically, MSFDPM consists of a side information feature extractor, a
multi-scale feature domain patch matching module, and a multi-scale feature
fusion network. Furthermore, we reuse inter-patch correlation from the shallow
layer to accelerate the patch matching of the deep layer. Finally, we nd that
our patch matching in a multi-scale feature domain further improves compression
rate by about 20% compared with the patch matching method at image domain

cosmological observations. We derive predictions of our generalized non-local

capture long range dependencies through the self-attention module in the

equations that include all relevant physical processes remain beyond our
current reach. In this review, I will discuss the current state of neutrino
modeling in general relativistic simulations of neutron star mergers and of
their post-merger remnants. I will focus on the three main types of algorithms
used in simulations so far: leakage, moments, and Monte-Carlo scheme. I will
review the advantages and limitations of each scheme, as well as the various
neutrino-matter interactions that should be included in simulations. We will
see that the quality of the treatment of neutrinos in merger simulations has
greatly increased over the last decade, but also that many potentially
important interactions remain difficult to take into account in simulations
(pair annihilation, oscillations, inelastic scattering).

occlusions and it can be challenging to accurately track the irregular motion
of objects for LiDAR-based methods. Some fusion methods work well but do not
consider the untrustworthy issue of appearance features under occlusion. At the
same time, the false detection problem also significantly affects tracking. As
such, we propose a novel camera-LiDAR fusion 3D MOT framework based on the
Combined Appearance-Motion Optimization (CAMO-MOT), which uses both camera and
LiDAR data and significantly reduces tracking failures caused by occlusion and
false detection. For occlusion problems, we are the first to propose an
occlusion head to select the best object appearance features multiple times
effectively, reducing the influence of occlusions. To decrease the impact of
false detection in tracking, we design a motion cost matrix based on confidence
scores which improve the positioning and object prediction accuracy in 3D
space. As existing multi-object tracking methods only consider a single
category, we also propose to build a multi-category loss to implement
multi-object tracking in multi-category scenes. A series of validation
experiments are conducted on the KITTI and nuScenes tracking benchmarks. Our
proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and the lowest identity

  Simple Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation"", submitted to TKDE",,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Contrastive learning (CL) has recently been demonstrated critical in
improving recommendation performance. The underlying principle of CL-based
recommendation models is to ensure the consistency between representations
derived from different graph augmentations of the user-item bipartite graph.
This self-supervised approach allows for the extraction of general features
from raw data, thereby mitigating the issue of data sparsity. Despite the
effectiveness of this paradigm, the factors contributing to its performance
gains have yet to be fully understood. This paper provides novel insights into
the impact of CL on recommendation. Our findings indicate that CL enables the
model to learn more evenly distributed user and item representations, which
alleviates the prevalent popularity bias and promoting long-tail items. Our
analysis also suggests that the graph augmentations, previously considered
essential, are relatively unreliable and of limited significance in CL-based
recommendation. Based on these findings, we put forward an eXtremely Simple
Graph Contrastive Learning method (XSimGCL) for recommendation, which discards
the ineffective graph augmentations and instead employs a simple yet effective
noise-based embedding augmentation to generate views for CL. A comprehensive
experimental study on four large and highly sparse benchmark datasets
demonstrates that, though the proposed method is extremely simple, it can
smoothly adjust the uniformity of learned representations and outperforms its
graph augmentation-based counterparts by a large margin in both recommendation
accuracy and training efficiency. The code and used datasets are released at

near-infrared photometry of up to 19 calibrator SNe Ia and further 57 SNe Ia in
the Hubble flow ($z>0.01$), and directly measure their peak magnitudes in the
$J$ and $H$ band by Gaussian processes and spline interpolation. Calibrator
peak magnitudes together with Cepheid-based distances are used to estimate the
average absolute magnitude in each band, while Hubble-flow SNe are used to
constrain the zero-point intercept of the magnitude-redshift relation. Our

a measurement with a precision of 2.8\% in both bands. The variant with the

increase the number of calibrator SNe Ia, be able to extend the

fundamental process in quantum optics, and is key to many quantum applications.
As a distinctive feature, two photons are never detected simultaneously in the

However, it has been theoretically proposed that the photon anti-correlations
can be thought to arise from quantum interference between two possible
two-photon scattering amplitudes, which one refers to as coherent and
incoherent. This picture is in stark contrast to the aforementioned one, in
that it assumes that the atom even has two different mechanisms at its disposal
to scatter two photons at the same time. Here, we validate the interference
picture by experimentally verifying the 40-year-old conjecture that, by
spectrally rejecting only the coherent component of the fluorescence light of a
single two-level atom, the remaining light consists of photon pairs that have
been simultaneously scattered by the atom. Our results offer fundamental
insights into the quantum-mechanical interaction between light and matter and

end of the SE radio jet, we find lower-energy X-ray emission that coincides
with a region of CO turbulence and fast outflow motions. This suggests that the
hot Interstellar Medium (ISM) may be compressed by the jet and molecular
outflow, resulting in more efficient cooling. Hydrodynamic simulations of
jet-ISM interaction tailored to NGC 1167 are in agreement with this conclusion
and with the overall morphology and spectra of the X-ray emission. The faint

automatically detect landslides based on large-scale multiple sources of
satellite imagery collected globally. The 2022 L4S aims to foster
interdisciplinary research on recent developments in deep learning (DL) models
for the semantic segmentation task using satellite imagery. In the past few
years, DL-based models have achieved performance that meets expectations on
image interpretation, due to the development of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). The main objective of this article is to present the details and the
best-performing algorithms featured in this competition. The winning solutions
are elaborated with state-of-the-art models like the Swin Transformer,
SegFormer, and U-Net. Advanced machine learning techniques and strategies such
as hard example mining, self-training, and mix-up data augmentation are also
considered. Moreover, we describe the L4S benchmark data set in order to
facilitate further comparisons, and report the results of the accuracy
assessment online. The data is accessible on \textit{Future Development
Leaderboard} for future evaluation at
\url{https://www.iarai.ac.at/landslide4sense/challenge/}, and researchers are
invited to submit more prediction results, evaluate the accuracy of their
methods, compare them with those of other users, and, ideally, improve the
landslide detection results reported in this article.

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic of the whole Universe. The
definition of a general picture describing the physics behind GRBs has always
been a compelling task, but the results obtained so far from observations have
revealed a puzzling landscape. The lack of a clear, unique paradigm calls for
further observations and additional, independent techniques for this purpose.
Polarimetry constitutes a very useful example as it allows us to investigate
some features of the source such as the geometry of the emitting region and the
magnetic field configuration. To date, only a handful of bursts detected by
space telescopes have been accompanied by ground-based spectro-polarimetric
follow-up, and therefore such an analysis of more GRBs is of crucial importance
in order to increase the sample of bursts with multi-epoch polarisation
analysis. In this work, we present the analysis of the GRB 080928 optical
afterglow, with observations performed with the ESO-VLT FORS1 instrument. We
find that the GRB optical afterglow was not significantly polarised on the
first observing night. The polarisation degree ($P$) grew on the following
night to a level of $P \sim$ 4.5%, giving evidence of polarised radiation at a
4 $\sigma$ confidence level. The GRB 080928 light curve is not fully consistent
with standard afterglow models, making any comparison with polarimetric models
partly inconclusive. The most conservative interpretation is that the GRB
emission was characterised by a homogeneous jet and was observed at an angle of
0.6 $< \theta_{obs}/\theta_{jet} <$ 0.8. Moreover, the non-zero polarisation
degree on the second night suggests the presence of a dominant locally ordered
magnetic field in the emitting region.

combines some of the ideas from the localization algebra approach to the coarse
Baum-Connes conjecture and the controlled algebra approach to the Farrell-Jones

First, as the model is defined for all $G$-actions, we are able to define
relative assembly maps. We prove, by using an induction structure of our
theory, a transitivity principle that can be used to verify when a relative
assembly map is an isomorphism. This promotes the study of the original
assembly map relative to the family of finite subgroups to assembly maps
relative to any family of subgroups of a group. Second, our new model is
suitable for the use of the method of controlled topology and controlled
algebra, which plays an important role in proving the coarse Baum-Connes
conjecture and the Farrell-Jones conjecture for a large class of groups.

to capture small objects, local features, and region proposals for densely
overlapped objects in aerial imagery due to the high variation of object sizes
in satellite imagery with respect to the image size and high variation of
content. Aerial imagery content varies greatly within the dataset due to the
large change in lighting conditions, and the type of ground imagery captures
from high altitudes. The variation is even higher between different datasets as
object sizes, class distributions, image acquisition, and weather conditions
can vary even more drastically. Thus, Domain Adaptation (DA) has been
introduced as a band-aid to alleviate the degradation of object identification
in previously unseen datasets. In this paper, we propose a small object
detection pipeline that improves the feature extraction process by spatial
pyramid pooling, cross-stage partial networks, heat-map-based region proposal
network, and objects localization and identification through a novel image
difficulty score that adapts the overall focal loss measure based on the image
difficulty. Next, we propose novel contrastive learning with progressive domain
adaptation to produce domain-invariant features across aerial datasets using
local and global features. Effective analysis and illustration of different
performance metrics and challenges show that our proposed method is comparable
to the current State-of-Art models and creates a first-ever Domain Adaptation
benchmark for the object detection task in highly imbalanced satellite datasets

solar wind ions. A time backward stochastic simulation is employed to solve the
transport equation to obtain the SEP time-intensity profile at any location,
energy, and pitch angle. The model is applied to a SEP event on 2020 May 29,
observed by STEREO-A close to 1 au and by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) when it was
about 0.33 au away from the Sun. The SEP event was associated with a very slow
CME with a plane-of-sky speed of 337 km/s at a height below 6 $\rm R_S$ as
reported in the SOHO/LASCO CME catalog. We compute the time profiles of
particle flux at PSP and STEREO-A locations, and estimate both the spectral
index of the proton energy spectrum for energies between 2 and 16 MeV and the
equivalent path length of the magnetic field lines experienced by the first
arriving SEPs. We found that the simulation results are well correlated with

In the high-privacy regime (small $\epsilon$), the hardness depends on a
coupled effect of privacy and partial information about the reward
distributions. In the low-privacy regime (large $\epsilon$), bandits with
$\epsilon$-global DP are not harder than the bandits without privacy. For
stochastic bandits, we further propose a generic framework to design a

algorithm. The framework consists of three ingredients: the Laplace mechanism,
arm-dependent adaptive episodes, and usage of only the rewards collected in the

$\epsilon$-global DP extensions of UCB and KL-UCB algorithms, namely AdaP-UCB

second-order quantum coherence function - interference oscillations and a
long-baseline asymptotic value that depends on the observation frequency,
temperatures and size of both objects. We apply our approach to the case of

However, its computation remains challenging as it requires a concurrent task

more complicated when considering performance of a general system, whose
failure event is represented as a link-set of cut-sets. This is because even
when component events have smooth and convex limit-state functions, the system
limit-state function has neither property, except in trivial cases. To address
the challenge, this study develops an efficient algorithm to solve RBO problems
of general system events. We employ the buffered optimization and reliability
method (BORM), which utilizes, instead of the conventional failure probability
definition, the buffered failure probability. The proposed algorithm solves a
sequence of difference-of-convex RBO models iteratively by employing a proximal

proposed algorithm within a minute with high accuracy. We also demonstrate its

dependency has received considerable critical attention. Many package managers,
such as Maven, Pip, and NPM, are proposed to manage TPLs. Moreover, a
significant amount of effort has been put into studying dependencies in
language ecosystems like Java, Python, and JavaScript except C/C++. Due to the
lack of a unified package manager for C/C++, existing research has only few
understanding of TPL dependencies in the C/C++ ecosystem, especially at large
scale.
  Towards understanding TPL dependencies in the C/C++ecosystem, we collect
existing TPL databases, package management tools, and dependency detection
tools, summarize the dependency patterns of C/C++ projects, and construct a
comprehensive and precise C/C++ dependency detector. Using our detector, we
extract dependencies from a large-scale database containing 24K C/C++
repositories from GitHub. Based on the extracted dependencies, we provide the
results and findings of an empirical study, which aims at understanding the
characteristics of the TPL dependencies. We further discuss the implications to
manage dependency for C/C++ and the future research directions for software
engineering researchers and developers in fields of library development,
software composition analysis, and C/C++package manager.

brain-like, does the network become more accurate? Previous attempts to address
this question showed very modest gains in accuracy, owing in part to
limitations of the regularization method. To overcome these limitations, we
developed a new neural data regularizer for CNNs that uses Deep Canonical
Correlation Analysis (DCCA) to optimize the resemblance of the CNN's image
representations to that of the monkey visual cortex. Using this new neural data
regularizer, we see much larger performance gains in both classification
accuracy and within-super-class accuracy, as compared to the previous
state-of-the-art neural data regularizers. These networks are also more robust
to adversarial attacks than their unregularized counterparts. Together, these
results confirm that neural data regularization can push CNN performance
higher, and introduces a new method that obtains a larger performance boost.

  Readout and Preparation Scheme","18 pages. 5 figures. Submitted to Physical Review Applied",,,,"physics.atom-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Atom-based radio frequency electromagnetic field sensing using atomic Rydberg
states is a promising technique that has recently attracted significant
interest. Its unique advantages, such as extraordinary bandwidth,
self-calibration and all-dielectric sensors, are a tangible improvement over
antenna-based methods in applications such as test and measurement, and
development of broad bandwidth receivers. Here, we demonstrate how an optical
frequency comb can be used to acquire data in the Autler-Townes regime of
Rydberg atom-based electrometry in a massively parallel fashion, eliminating
the need for laser scanning. Two-photon electromagnetically induced
transparency read-out and preparation of cesium is used for the demonstration.
A flat, quasi-continuous optical comb is generated with the probe laser at 852
nm using an electro-optic modulator and arbitrary waveform generator. A single
frequency coupling laser at 509 nm is tuned to the Rydberg launch state. An
enhanced transmission signal is obtained using self-heterodyne spectroscopy.
The comb signal is beat against a local oscillator derived from the single
frequency probe laser on a fast photodiode. The transmission of each probe
laser comb tooth is observed. We resolve electromagnetically induced
transparency peaks with linewidths below 5 MHz, with and without laser locking.
Radio frequency electromagnetic fields as low as 66 $\mu$Vcm$^{-1}$ are
detected with sensitivities of 2.3 $\mu$Vcm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$. The method
offers a significant advantage for reading-out electromagnetically induced
transparency and Autler-Townes splitting as neither laser needs to be scanned
and slow frequency drifts can be tolerated in some applications. The method
enables the detection of the amplitude of a pulsed radio frequency
electromagnetic field when the incoming pulse Autler-Townes splits the
electromagnetically induced transparency peak.

superintegrable spherically symmetric electro-gravitational backgrounds in $n$

dynamical systems which are all mutually interconnected by a web of point
particle T-dualities. In particular, the dynamics of a charged particle
scattered by a repulsive Coulomb potential in a flat space is T-dual to the
dynamics of the Coulomb scattering in the space of constant negative curvature,
but it is also T-dual to the (conformal) Calogero-Moser inverse square dynamics
both in flat and hyperbolic spaces. Thus knowing just the Hamiltonian dynamics

expected number of offspring an individual will produce. The actual number of
offspring is also subject to noise, arising from environmental or demographic
stochasticity. In nature, individuals who are more fecund tend to have greater
variance in their offspring number -- sometimes far greater than the Poisson
variance assumed in classical models of population genetics. Here, we develop a
model for the evolution of two types reproducing in a population of

by pairwise interactions in a prisoner's dilemma game, but the offspring number
is subject to an exogenously controlled variance that may depend upon the mean.
Whereas defectors are preferred by natural selection in classical well-mixed
populations, since they always have greater fitness than cooperators, we show
that large offspring variance can reverse the direction of evolution and favor
cooperation. Reproductive over-dispersion produces qualitatively new dynamics

the system has an optimized critical dimension with a probable Raman and

includes a set of commutative self-adjoint operators and an interaction terms

a detailed representation of complex anatomy that enables quantitative analysis
and the comparison of shapes and their variations. SSM applies mathematics,
statistics, and computing to parse the shape into a quantitative representation
(such as correspondence points or landmarks) that will help answer various
questions about the anatomical variations across the population. Complex
anatomical structures have many diverse parts with varying interactions or
intricate architecture. For example, the heart is four-chambered anatomy with
several shared boundaries between chambers. Coordinated and efficient
contraction of the chambers of the heart is necessary to adequately perfuse end
organs throughout the body. Subtle shape changes within these shared boundaries
of the heart can indicate potential pathological changes that lead to
uncoordinated contraction and poor end-organ perfusion. Early detection and
robust quantification could provide insight into ideal treatment techniques and
intervention timing. However, existing SSM approaches fall short of explicitly
modeling the statistics of shared boundaries. This paper presents a general and
flexible data-driven approach for building statistical shape models of
multi-organ anatomies with shared boundaries that capture morphological and
alignment changes of individual anatomies and their shared boundary surfaces

methods using a biventricular heart dataset by developing shape models that
consistently parameterize the cardiac biventricular structure and the

Federated Learning and Transfer Learning. This newly proposed Federated
Transfer Learning framework aims at connecting data islands with privacy
protection. Our construction is based on Federated Learning and Transfer
Learning. Compared with previous Federated Transfer Learnings, where each user
should have data with identical modalities (either all unimodal or all
multimodal), our new framework is more generic, it allows a hybrid distribution
of user data. The core strategy is to use two different but inherently
connected training methods for our two types of users. Supervised Learning is
adopted for users with only unimodal data (Type 1), while Self-Supervised
Learning is applied to user with multimodal data (Type 2) for both the feature
of each modality and the connection between them. This connection knowledge of
Type 2 will help Type 1 in later stages of training. Training in the new
framework can be divided in three steps. In the first step, users who have data
with the identical modalities are grouped together. For example, user with only
sound signals are in group one, and those with only images are in group two,
and users with multimodal data are in group three, and so on. In the second
step, Federated Learning is executed within the groups, where Supervised
Learning and Self-Supervised Learning are used depending on the group's nature.
Most of the Transfer Learning happens in the third step, where the related
parts in the network obtained from the previous steps are aggregated

feature extraction and low inference cost, convolutional neural networks (CNN)
are increasingly used in PINN. However, some challenges still remain as
follows. To adapt convolutional PINN to solve different PDEs, considerable
effort is usually needed for tuning critical hyperparameters. Furthermore, the
effects of the finite difference accuracy, and the mesh resolution on the
predictivity of convolutional PINN are not settled. To fill the gaps above, we
propose three initiatives in this paper: (1) A Multi-Receptive-Field PINN
(MRF-PINN) model is established to solve different types of PDEs on various
mesh resolutions without manual tuning; (2) The dimensional balance method is
used to estimate the loss weights when solving Navier-Stokes equations; (3) The
Taylor polynomial is used to pad the virtual nodes near the boundaries for
implementing high-order finite difference. The proposed MRF-PINN is tested for
solving three typical linear PDEs (elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic) and a
series of nonlinear PDEs (Navier-Stokes PDEs) to demonstrate its generality and
superiority. This paper shows that MRF-PINN can adapt to completely different
equation types and mesh resolutions without any hyperparameter tuning. The
dimensional balance method saves computational time and improves the
convergence for solving Navier-Stokes PDEs. Further, the solving error is
significantly decreased under high-order finite difference, large channel

novel Bayesian multiobjective ranking and selection method (MORS-SK) that
sequentially allocates extra samples to competitive solutions, in view of
reducing the misclassification errors when identifying the solutions with the
best expected performance. The approach uses stochastic kriging to build
reliable predictive distributions of the objective outcomes, and exploits this
information to decide how to resample. Experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms a standard allocation method, as well as the
state-of-the-art MOCBA approach. Moreover, we show that the use of stochastic
kriging information would also benefit both the standard and the MOCBA
allocation approach; yet, MORS-SK remains superior.

a modified GB (mGB) distribution. The SDE approach allows for a lucid

of GB distribution and, further down, of Generalized Inverse Gamma (GIGa) and
Generalized Gamma (GGa) limits, as well as describe the transition between the
latter two. We provide an alternative form to the ""traditional"" GB PDF to
underscore that a great deal of usefulness of GB distribution lies in its
allowing a long-range power-law behavior to be ultimately terminated at a
finite value. We derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the
""traditional"" GB, which belongs to the family generated by the regularized beta
function and is crucial for analysis of the tails of the distribution. We
analyze fifty years of historical data on realized market volatility,
specifically for S\&P500, as a case study of the use of GB/mGB distributions

radical transformation motivated by technological, environmental and

production and storing, the insurgence of climate change and the attention for
the introduction of low impact technologies in some countries are main factors
leading this transformation. Here we focus in particular on the introduction of
relatively small community energy systems based on solar energy that aim to
re-organize local energy systems to integrate distributed energy resources and
engage local communities. In each community, there is a set of producers and a
set of consumers (and a set of producers/consumers called prosumers). One of
the key aspects of the energetic communities is to maximise the energy that is
shared within the user. Thus, it is crucial to select the best
consumers/prosumers on the basis of their profile of consumption, in order to
minimize subsequent management of the energy once the community is built. Here
we describe the design of a recommender sysstem that is able to profile users
on the basis of their past profile for subsequent admission into the energetic
community. Experiments supporting this publication have been carried out under

to efficiently elicit users' preferences via conversational interactions. To
achieve this, the recommender system conducts conversations with users, asking
their preferences for different items or item categories. Most existing
conversational recommender systems for cold-start users utilize a multi-armed
bandit framework to learn users' preference in an online manner. However, they
rely on a pre-defined conversation frequency for asking about item categories
instead of individual items, which may incur excessive conversational
interactions that hurt user experience. To enable more flexible questioning
about key-terms, we formulate a new conversational bandit problem that allows
the recommender system to choose either a key-term or an item to recommend at
each round and explicitly models the rewards of these actions. This motivates
us to handle a new exploration-exploitation (EE) trade-off between key-term
asking and item recommendation, which requires us to accurately model the
relationship between key-term and item rewards. We conduct a survey and analyze
a real-world dataset to find that, unlike assumptions made in prior works,
key-term rewards are mainly affected by rewards of representative items. We
propose two bandit algorithms, Hier-UCB and Hier-LinUCB, that leverage this
observed relationship and the hierarchical structure between key-terms and
items to efficiently learn which items to recommend. We theoretically prove
that our algorithm can reduce the regret bound's dependency on the total number
of items from previous work. We validate our proposed algorithms and regret
bound on both synthetic and real-world data.

session-processes to explore the full expressive power of the pi-calculus where
the mixed choices are proved more expressive than the (non-mixed) guarded
choices. To account this issue, recently Casal, Mordido, and Vasconcelos
proposed the binary session types with mixed choices (CMV+). This paper carries
a surprising, unfortunate result on CMV+: in spite of an inclusion of
unrestricted channels with mixed choice, CMV+'s mixed choice is rather separate
and not mixed. We prove this negative result using two methodologies (using
either the leader election problem or a synchronisation pattern as
distinguishing feature), showing that there exists no good encoding from the
pi-calculus into CMV+, preserving distribution. We then close their open
problem on the encoding from CMV+ into CMV (without mixed choice), proving its
soundness and thereby that the encoding is good up to coupled similarity.
