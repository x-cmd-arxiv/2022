Population III (Pop III), has until now largely neglected the impact of
magnetic fields. Complementing a series of recent studies of the
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) aspects of Pop III star formation, we here carry out
a suite of idealized numerical experiments where we ascertain how the
fragmentation properties of primordial protostellar discs are modified if MHD
effects are present. Specifically, starting from cosmological initial
conditions, we focus on the central region in a select minihalo at redshift
$z\sim$ 25, inserting a magnetic field at an intermediate evolutionary stage,
normalized to a fraction of the equipartition value. To explore parameter
space, we consider different field geometries, including uniform, radial,
toroidal, and poloidal field configurations, with the toroidal configuration
being the most realistic. The collapse of the gas is followed for $\sim$8
orders of magnitude in density after the field was inserted, until a maximum of
$10^{15}{\rm \,cm}^{-3}$ is reached. We find that the magnetic field leads to a
delay in the collapse of the gas. Moreover, the toroidal field has the
strongest effect on the collapse as it inhibits the fragmentation of the
emerging disc surrounding the central core and leads to the formation of a more
massive core. The full understanding of the formation of Pop~III stars and
their mass distribution thus needs to take into account the effect of magnetic
fields. We further conclude that ideal MHD is only a first step in this
endeavor, to be followed-up with a comprehensive treatment of dissipative
effects, such as ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation.

which an adversary aims to predict whether or not a particular sample was
contained in the target model's training dataset. Existing attack methods have
commonly exploited the output information (mostly, losses) solely from the
given target model. As a result, in practical scenarios where both the member
and non-member samples yield similarly small losses, these methods are
naturally unable to differentiate between them. To address this limitation, in
this paper, we propose a new attack method, called \system, which can exploit
the membership information from the whole training process of the target model
for improving the attack performance. To mount the attack in the common
black-box setting, we leverage knowledge distillation, and represent the
membership information by the losses evaluated on a sequence of intermediate
models at different distillation epochs, namely \emph{distilled loss
trajectory}, together with the loss from the given target model. Experimental
results over different datasets and model architectures demonstrate the great
advantage of our attack in terms of different metrics. For example, on
CINIC-10, our attack achieves at least 6$\times$ higher true-positive rate at a
low false-positive rate of 0.1\% than existing methods. Further analysis
demonstrates the general effectiveness of our attack in more strict scenarios.

living systems and play different roles when interacting with proteins and

than that of sodium, which provides a suitable environment for biochemical
machinery. These cations also possess different properties in physico-chemical
Hofmeister phenomena. It is now accepted that the main physical reason for
these ion-specific effects is due to formation of ion pairs. The greater
ability of sodium over potassium to destabilize protein solutions was
previously rationalized by sodium stronger pairing with carboxylates, which are
the main anionic moiety of proteins. While ion pairing of cations with
carboxylates was studied in detail previously, understanding of the molecular
mechanisms of cation-specific mediation of protein-protein interactions is
still lacking. In this work with the use of molecular dynamics we studied the
effect of sodium and potassium on interactions between model compounds that
bear typical positively and negatively charged groups of proteins, namely,
methylammonium and acetate molecules. We found only a weak difference in the
contacts of charged groups depending on the cation type present in the

not critical, but structural features may be more important.

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods for cyber security

Artificial Intelligence in recent years, Artificial Intelligence including
Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) has been widely utilized in the
fields of cyber security including intrusion detection, malware detection, and
spam filtering. However, although Artificial Intelligence-based approaches for
the detection and defense of cyber attacks and threats are more advanced and
efficient compared to the conventional signature-based and rule-based cyber
security strategies, most ML-based techniques and DL-based techniques are
deployed in the black-box manner, meaning that security experts and customers
are unable to explain how such procedures reach particular conclusions. The
deficiencies of transparency and interpretability of existing Artificial
Intelligence techniques would decrease human users' confidence in the models
utilized for the defense against cyber attacks, especially in current
situations where cyber attacks become increasingly diverse and complicated.
Therefore, it is essential to apply XAI in the establishment of cyber security
models to create more explainable models while maintaining high accuracy and
allowing human users to comprehend, trust, and manage the next generation of
cyber defense mechanisms. Although there are papers reviewing Artificial
Intelligence applications in cyber security areas and the vast literature on
applying XAI in many fields including healthcare, financial services, and
criminal justice, the surprising fact is that there are currently no survey
research articles that concentrate on XAI applications in cyber security.

exotic quantum phenomena, which can be fundamentally traced back to
non-unitarity and is much more fundamental and universal than complex energy
spectrum. In this paper, we introduce an interesting quantity (denoted as
$\eta$) as a new variant of the Petermann factor to directly and efficiently
measure non-unitarity and the associated non-Hermitian physics. By tuning the
model parameters of underlying non-Hermitian systems, we find that the
discontinuity of both $\eta$ and its first-order derivative (denoted as
$\partial \eta$) pronouncedly captures rich physics that is fundamentally
caused by non-unitarity. More concretely, in the 1D non-Hermitian topological
systems, two mutually orthogonal edge states that are respectively localized on
two boundaries become non-orthogonal in the vicinity of discontinuity of $\eta$
as a function of the model parameter, which is dubbed ``edge state
transition''. Through theoretical analysis, we identify that the appearance of
edge state transition indicates the existence of exceptional points~(EPs) in
topological edge states. Regarding the discontinuity of $\partial\eta$, we
investigate a two-level non-Hermitian model and establish a connection between
the points of discontinuity of $\partial \eta$ and EPs of bulk states. By
studying this connection in more general lattice models, we find that some

strong non-axisymmetric disk structure are more common in barred galaxies than
in unbarred galaxies. However, we find that spiral arms also increase
$C_{mol}$. We show that there is a good correlation between $C_{mol}$ and the
$strength$ of non-axisymmetric structure (which can be due to a bar, spiral
arms, or both). This suggests that the stronger the bars and spirals, the more
efficient the galaxy is at transporting cold gas to its center. Despite the
small subsample size, $C_{mol}$ of the four Seyferts are not significantly
reduced compared to inactive galaxies of similar disk structure, implying that
the AGN feedback in Seyferts may not notably affect the molecular gas
distribution in the central $\sim$2kpc. We find that $C_{SFR}$ tightly
correlates with $C_{mol}$ in both unbarred and barred galaxies. Likewise,
elevated $C_{SFR}$ is found in galaxies with strong disk structure. Our results
suggest that the disk structure, either spirals or bars, can transport gas to
the central regions, with higher inflow rates corresponding to stronger
structure, and consequently boost central star formation. Both spirals and bars
play, therefore, an essential role in the secular evolution of disk galaxies.

scaled sample clouds in light-tailed margins and their so-called limit sets,
has recently been shown to connect several existing extremal dependence
concepts. However, these results are purely probabilistic, and the geometric
approach itself has not been fully exploited for statistical inference. We
outline a method for parametric estimation of the limit set shape, which
includes a useful non/semi-parametric estimate as a pre-processing step. More
fundamentally, our approach provides a new class of asymptotically-motivated
statistical models for the tails of multivariate distributions, and such models
can accommodate any combination of simultaneous or non-simultaneous extremes
through appropriate parametric forms for the limit set shape. Extrapolation
further into the tail of the distribution is possible via simulation from the
fitted model. A simulation study confirms that our methodology is very
competitive with existing approaches, and can successfully allow estimation of
small probabilities in regions where other methods struggle. We apply the
methodology to two environmental datasets, with diagnostics demonstrating a
good fit.

In-medium masses of the open charm mesons and charmonium state are calculated

lowest Landau level contributions. The strong magnetic field causes
modifications to occur due to the mixing of the $D-D^{*}$ and
$\bar{D}-\bar{D}^{*}$ mesons (PV mixing). For the charmonium state,
$\psi(3770)$, the effects of the Dirac sea are incorporated on the mass
modifications through the medium modified scalar dilaton field, $\chi$, which

the radiative interior of stars evolving after the main sequence. Such internal
magnetic fields have never been observed in evolved stars. As a result, there
is a major piece missing from our global picture of stars as dynamical bodies.
Asteroseismology opened a window onto stellar internal dynamics, as oscillation
frequencies, amplitudes, and lifetimes are affected by processes that are
taking place inside the star. In this scope, magnetic signatures on mixed-mode
frequencies have recently been characterized, but the task of detection remains
challenging as the mixed-mode frequency pattern is highly complex and affected
by rotational effects, while modes of different radial orders are often
intertwined. In this work, we aim to build a bridge between theoretical
prescriptions and complex asteroseismic data analysis to facilitate a future
search and characterization of internal magnetism with asteroseismology. We
investigate the effect of magnetic fields inside evolved stars with solar-like
oscillations on the estimation of the period spacing of gravity-mode components
of simulated mixed gravito-acoustic modes. We derived a new corrected
stretching function of the power spectrum density to account for the presence
of magnetic signatures on their frequencies. We demonstrate that the strong
dependency of the amplitude of the magnetic signature with mixed-mode
frequencies leads to biased estimates of period spacings towards lower values.
We also show that a careful analysis of the oscillation frequency pattern
through various period spacing estimates and across a broad frequency range
might lead to the first detection of magnetic fields inside red giants and at
the same time, we adjust the measured value of gravity-mode period spacing.

Although device fingerprinting has shown promising performances, its

when trained and tested under different settings, these models exhibit moderate

constrained. Here we consider how Jupiter's migration affects small-body
reservoirs and how this constrains its original orbital distance from the Sun.
We study the implications of large-scale and inward radial migration of Jupiter
for the inner solar system while considering the effects of collisional
evolution of planetesimals. We use analytical prescriptions to simulate the
growth and migration of Jupiter in the gas disk. We assume the existence of a
planetesimal disk inside Jupiter's initial orbit. This planetesimal disk
received an initial total mass and size-frequency distribution (SFD).
Planetesimals feel the effects of aerodynamic gas drag and collide with one
another, mostly while shepherded by the migrating Jupiter. Our main goal is to
measure the amount of mass in planetesimals implanted into the main asteroid
belt (MAB) and the SFD of the implanted population. We also monitor the amount
of dust produced during planetesimal collisions. We find that the SFD of the
planetesimal population implanted into the MAB tends to resemble that of the
original planetesimal population interior to Jupiter. We also find that unless
very little or no mass existed between 5 au and Jupiter's original orbit, it
would be difficult to reconcile the current low mass of the MAB with the
possibility that Jupiter migrated from distances beyond 15 au. This is because
the fraction of the original disk mass that gets implanted into the MAB is very
large. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in terms of dust
production to the so-called NC-CC isotopic dichotomy.

images of an exoplanet to be obtained by JWST, and the first ever direct
detection of an exoplanet beyond 5 $\mu$m. These observations demonstrate that
JWST is exceeding its nominal predicted performance by up to a factor of 10,
depending on separation and subtraction method, with measured 5$\sigma$
contrast limits of $\sim$1$\times10^{-5}$ and $\sim$2$\times10^{-4}$ at 1"" for
NIRCam at 4.4 $\mu$m and MIRI at 11.3 $\mu$m, respectively. These contrast
limits provide sensitivity to sub-Jupiter companions with masses as low as
0.3$M_\mathrm{Jup}$ beyond separations of $\sim$100 au. Together with existing
ground-based near-infrared data, the JWST photometry are well fit by a BT-SETTL
atmospheric model from 1-16 $\mu$m, and span $\sim$97% of HIP 65426 b's
luminous range. Independent of the choice of model atmosphere we measure an
empirical bolometric luminosity that is tightly constrained between
$\mathrm{log}\!\left(L_\mathrm{bol}/L_{\odot}\right)$=-4.31 to $-$4.14, which
in turn provides a robust mass constraint of 7.1$\pm$1.2 $M_\mathrm{Jup}$. In
totality, these observations confirm that JWST presents a powerful and exciting
opportunity to characterise the population of exoplanets amenable to
high-contrast imaging in greater detail.

stable predictive models. Current approaches for discovering conservation laws
often depend on detailed dynamical information, such as the equation of motion
or fine-grained time measurements, with many recent proposals also relying on
black box parametric deep learning methods. We instead reformulate this task as
a manifold learning problem and propose a non-parametric approach, combining
the Wasserstein metric from optimal transport with diffusion maps, to discover
conserved quantities that vary across trajectories sampled from a dynamical
system. We test this new approach on a variety of physical
systems$\unicode{x2014}$including conservative Hamiltonian systems, dissipative

manifold learning method is able to both identify the number of conserved

and manifold learning, our proposed method provides a direct geometric approach
to identifying conservation laws that is both robust and interpretable without
requiring an explicit model of the system nor accurate time information.

has long hindered efforts to study the fainter, more numerous population often
thought largely responsible for reionization. Here we use CEERS JWST/NIRCam
data to characterize 118 UV-faint (median M$_{UV}=-19.6$) $z\sim6.5-8$
galaxies. We find that the SEDs are typically dominated by young ($\sim$10-50
Myr), low-mass ($M_\ast\sim10^8\ M_\odot$) stellar populations, with no need
for extreme masses ($\sim10^{11} M_\odot$) among our sample in contrast to
recent findings in CEERS. Considering previous studies of UV-bright
(M$_{UV}\sim-22$) $z\sim7-8$ galaxies, we find evidence for a strong
(5-10$\times$) increase in specific star formation rate toward lower
luminosities (median sSFR=82 Gyr$^{-1}$ in CEERS). The larger sSFRs imply a
more dominant contribution from OB stars in the relatively numerous UV-faint
population, perhaps suggesting that these galaxies are very efficient ionizing
agents (median $\xi_{ion}=10^{25.7}$ erg$^{-1}$ Hz). In spite of their much
larger sSFRs, we find no significant increase in [OIII]$+$H$\beta$ EWs towards
fainter M$_{UV}$ (median $\approx$780 $\mathring{A}$). If confirmed, this may
indicate that a substantial fraction of our CEERS galaxies possess extremely
low metallicities ($\lesssim$3% $Z_\odot$) where [OIII] emission is suppressed.
Alternatively, high ionizing photon escape fractions or bursty star formation
histories can also weaken the nebular lines in a subset of our CEERS galaxies.
While the majority of our objects are very blue (median $\beta=-2.0$), we
identify a significant tail of very dusty galaxies ($\beta\sim-1$) at
$\approx$0.5$L_{UV}^\ast$ which may contribute significantly to the $z\sim7-8$
star formation rate density.

Realistic Synthesis. MotionDiffuse excels at modeling complicated data

highlight a so-far overlooked mechanism to form radio rings, shells and even
more complex structures around elliptical galaxies. Mach numbers of M = 2-3 for
such internal shocks are in agreement with the spectral indices of the observed
ORCs. We estimate that ~5 percent of galaxies could undergo merger events which
occasionally lead to such prominent structures within the galactic halo during
their lifetime, explaining the low number of observed ORCs. At the time when
the shock structures are matching the physical sizes of the observed ORCs, the
central galaxies are typically classified as early-type galaxies, with no
ongoing star formation, in agreement with observational findings. Although the
energy released by such mergers could potentially power the observed radio
luminosity already in Milky-Way-like halos, our predicted luminosity from a

growth using a large sample of hard X-ray selected Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN). We find a strong decrease in the fraction of obscured sources above the
Eddington limit for dusty gas ($\log \lambda_{\rm Edd}\gtrsim -2$) confirming
earlier results, and consistent with the radiation-regulated unification model.
This also explains the difference in the Eddington ratio distribution functions
(ERDFs) of type 1 and type 2 AGN obtained by a recent study. The break in the
ERDF of nearby AGN is at $\log \lambda_{\rm Edd}^{*}=-1.34\pm0.07$. This
corresponds to the $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ where AGN transition from having most of
their sky covered by obscuring material to being mostly devoid of absorbing
material. A similar trend is observed for the luminosity function, which
implies that most of the SMBH growth in the local Universe happens when the AGN
is covered by a large reservoir of gas and dust. These results could be
explained with a radiation-regulated growth model, in which AGN move in the
$N_{\rm H}-\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ plane during their life cycle. The growth episode
starts with the AGN mostly unobscured and accreting at low $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$.
As the SMBH is further fueled, $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$, $N_{\rm H}$ and covering
factor increase, leading AGN to be preferentially observed as obscured. Once
$\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ reaches the Eddington limit for dusty gas, the covering
factor and $N_{\rm H}$ rapidly decrease, leading the AGN to be typically
observed as unobscured. As the remaining fuel is depleted, the SMBH goes back
into a quiescent phase.

satellite galaxy quenching depends on the orientation relative to their central

quenched than those along the minor axis. In this paper, we report a detection
of such anisotropic quenching up to $z\sim1$ based on a large
optically-selected cluster catalogue constructed from the Hyper Suprime-Cam
Subaru Strategic Program. We calculate the quiescent satellite galaxy fraction
as a function of orientation angle measured from the major axis of central
galaxies and find that the quiescent fractions at $0.25<z<1$ are reasonably
fitted by sinusoidal functions with amplitudes of a few percent. Anisotropy is
clearer in inner regions ($<r_\mathrm{200m}$) of clusters and not significant
in cluster outskirts ($>r_\mathrm{200m}$). We also confirm that the observed
anisotropy cannot be explained by differences in local galaxy density or
stellar mass distribution along the two axes. Quiescent fraction excesses
between the two axes suggest that the quenching efficiency contributing to the
anisotropy is almost independent of stellar mass, at least down to our stellar
mass limit of $M_{*}=1\times10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$. Finally, we argue that the
physical origins of the observed anisotropy should have shorter quenching
timescales than $\sim1\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, like ram-pressure stripping, because,
for anisotropic quenching to be observed, satellites must be quenched before
their initial orientation angles are significantly changed.

the majority of Galactic boson stars will be too faint to be observable through
this effect. By contrast, the diffuse photon flux, in hard x-rays and soft
gamma-rays, produced by boson stars interacting with the ionized ISM phases can
be sizable. We compute this diffuse flux and compare it to existing
observations from HEAO-1, INTEGRAL and COMPTEL to infer limits on the fraction
of these objects. This novel method places constraints on boson star dark
matter while avoiding back-action effects from ambient baryons on the boson
star configuration, unlike terrestrial searches where it has been noted that
back-action can screen light bosonic fields. In addition, this study could be
extended to other couplings and structures formed from light dark matter. For

  black hole","Accepted for publication in Nature Astronomy",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Massive black holes (BHs) at the centres of massive galaxies are ubiquitous.
The population of BHs within dwarf galaxies, on the other hand, is evasive.
Dwarf galaxies are thought to harbour BHs with proportionally small masses,
including intermediate mass BHs, with masses $10^{2} < M_{BH} < 10^{6}
M_{\odot}$. Identification of these systems has historically relied upon the
detection of light emitted from accreting gaseous discs close to the BHs.
Without this light, they are difficult to detect. Tidal disruption events
(TDEs), the luminous flares produced when a star strays close to a BH and is
shredded, are a direct way to probe massive BHs. The rise times of these flares
theoretically correlate with the BH mass. Here we present AT2020neh, a fast
rising TDE candidate, hosted by a dwarf galaxy. AT2020neh can be described by
the tidal disruption of a main sequence star by a 10$^{4.7} - 10^{5.9}
M_{\odot}$ BH. We find the observable rate of fast rising nuclear transients
like AT2020neh to be rare, at $\lesssim 2 \times 10^{-8}$ events Mpc$^{-3}$
yr$^{-1}$. Finding non-accreting BHs in dwarf galaxies is important to
determine how prevalent BHs are within these galaxies, and constrain models of
BH formation. AT2020neh-like events may provide a galaxy-independent method of
measuring IMBH masses.

constitutes an attractive energy source for heating the intracluster medium
(ICM). How this energy dissipates into the ICM plasma remains unclear, given
its low collisionality and high magnetization (precluding viscous heating by
Coulomb processes). Kunz et al. 2011 proposed a viable heating mechanism based
on the anisotropy of the plasma pressure (gyroviscous heating) under ICM
conditions. The present paper builds upon that work and shows that particles
can be gyroviscously heated by large-scale turbulent fluctuations via magnetic
pumping. We study how the anisotropy evolves under a range of forcing
frequencies, what waves and instabilities are generated and demonstrate that
the particle distribution function acquires a high energy tail. For this, we
perform particle-in-cell simulations where we periodically vary the mean
magnetic field $\textbf{B}(t)$. When $\textbf{B}(t)$ grows (dwindles), a
pressure anisotropy $P_{\perp}>P_{\parallel}$ ($P_{\perp}< P_{\parallel}$)
builds up ($P_{\perp}$ and $P_{\parallel}$ are, respectively, the pressures
perpendicular and parallel to $\textbf{B}(t)$). These pressure anisotropies
excite mirror ($P_{\perp}>P_{\parallel}$) and oblique firehose
($P_{\parallel}>P_{\perp}$) instabilities, which trap and scatter the
particles, limiting the anisotropy and providing a channel to heat the plasma.
The efficiency of this mechanism depends on the frequency of the large-scale
turbulent fluctuations and the efficiency of the scattering the instabilities
provide in their nonlinear stage. We provide a simplified analytical heating
model that captures the phenomenology involved. Our results show that this
process can be relevant in dissipating and distributing turbulent energy at
kinetic scales in the ICM.

topologically obstructed and nodal, we show that the topological obstruction
for pairing in Dirac semimetals crucially only exists for certain pairing
symmetries. In particular, we focus on odd-parity $B_{1u}$ and $B_{2u}$ pairing
states, both of which can be induced by Ising ferromagnetic fluctuations. The
$B_{1u}$ and $B_{2u}$ pairing states inherit the topological obstruction from
the normal state, which dictates that these states necessarily hosts four
Bogolibov- de Gennes (BdG) Dirac point nodes protected by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
monopole charge. By a Wannier state analysis, we show that the topological
obstruction in the superconducting states is of higher-order nature. As a
result, in a rod geometry with gapped surfaces, arcs of higher-order Majorana
zero modes exist in certain $k_z$ regions of the hinges between the BdG Dirac
points. Unlike Fermi arcs in Weyl semimetals, the higher-order Majorana arcs
are stable against self-annihilation due to an additional $\mathbb{Z}$-valued
monopole charge of the BdG Dirac points protected by $\mathcal{C}_4$ symmetry.
We find that the same $\mathbb{Z}$-valued charge is also carried by $B_{1g}$

investigations of core-collapse supernovae find that this shock tends to
``stall'' at small radii ($\lesssim$ 10 neutron star radii), with stellar
material accreting onto the central object through the standing shock. Here, we
present time-steady, adiabatic solutions for the density, pressure, and
velocity of the shocked fluid that accretes onto the compact object through the
stalled shock, and we include the effects of general relativity in the
Schwarzschild metric. Similar to previous works that were carried out in the

approaches zero near the Schwarzschild radius. These solutions can represent
accretion onto a material surface if the radius of the compact object is

Milgromian (MOND) gravitation. These produce ETGs with star-forming timescales

collapse models with observations, we set constraints on the initial size and

$\sigma_{\mathrm{RV}} = 1-10\,\mathrm{cm/s}$ are required to study Earth-analog
systems, imposing stringent, sub-mK, thermo-mechanical stability requirements
on Doppler spectrograph designs. iLocater is a new, high-resolution
($R=190,500$ median) near infrared (NIR) EPRV spectrograph under construction
for the dual 8.4 m diameter Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The instrument is
one of the first to operate in the diffraction-limited regime enabled by the
use of adaptive optics and single-mode fibers. This facilitates affordable
optomechanical fabrication of the spectrograph using intrinsically stable
materials.
  We present the final design and performance of the iLocater cryostat and
thermal control system which houses the instrument spectrograph. The
spectrograph is situated inside an actively temperature-controlled radiation
shield mounted inside a multi-layer-insulation (MLI) lined vacuum chamber. The
radiation shield provides sub-mK thermal stability, building on the existing
heritage of the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) and NEID instruments. The
instrument operating temperature ($T=80-100\,\mathrm{K}$) is driven by the
requirement to minimize detector background and instantaneous coefficient of
thermal expansion (CTE) of the materials used for spectrograph fabrication.
This combination allows for a reduced thermomechanical impact on measurement
precision, improving the scientific capabilities of the instrument.

a reasonable fit to all neutrino data. The reason for the improved fit is that
the stringent disappearance constraints on the different elements of the

energy scales that are different from those that characterize the anomalous

two fundamental types of finite regions, which we call ""mirror-symmetric"" (MS)

island. The entanglement entropy of matter does not follow the Page curve for
semi-infinite regions in two-sided Schwarzschild black hole. For AS regions,
the time evolution is bounded from above due to the phenomenon that we call
""Cauchy surface breaking"". Shortly before the break, the island configuration
gets non-symmetric. For both types, there is a critical size of the region,
below which the island never dominates. For regions smaller than some other
critical size, the island does not emerge. Finally, we show that the island

asymmetric Laplace functional weight (ALF): a flexible, parametric function
that drives predictive relevance over the index space. Automatic dynamic
relevance determination (ADRD) is achieved with three unknowns per input
variable and enforces smoothness over the index space. Additionally, we discuss
a screening technique to assess under complete absence of prior and model
information whether ADRD is reasonably consistent with the data. Such tool may
serve for exploratory analyses and model diagnostics. ADRD is applied to remote
sensing data and predictions are generated in response to atmospheric
functional inputs. Fully Bayesian estimation is carried out to identify
relevant regions of the functional input space. Validation is performed to
benchmark against traditional vector-input model specifications. We find that
ADRD outperforms models with input dimension reduction via functional principal
component analysis. Furthermore, the predictive power is comparable to
high-dimensional models, in terms of both mean prediction and uncertainty, with
10 times fewer tuning parameters. Enforcing smoothness on the predictive

imperfections. Traditionally, imperfect shells tend to be characterized
empirically by the knockdown factor, the ratio between the measured buckling
strength and the corresponding classic prediction for a perfect shell.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that the knockdown factor of a shell
containing a single imperfection can be predicted when there is detailed a
priori knowledge of the defect geometry. Still, addressing the analogous
problem for a shell containing many defects remains an open question. Here, we
use finite element simulations, which we validate against precision
experiments, to investigate hemispherical shells containing a well-defined
distribution of imperfections. Our goal is to characterize the resulting
knockdown factor statistics. First, we study the buckling of shells containing
only two defects, uncovering nontrivial regimes of interactions that echo
existing findings for cylindrical shells. Then, we construct statistical
ensembles of imperfect shells, whose defect amplitudes are sampled from a
lognormal distribution. We find that a 3-parameter Weibull distribution is an
excellent description for the measured statistics of knockdown factors,
suggesting that shell buckling can be regarded as an extreme-value statistics
phenomenon.

out-of-plane direction in (-110) and (010) rotations and the planar <110>

from the lag of the magnetization with respect to the applied magnetic field as
the sample is rotated. The appearance of the hysteresis, which persist up to
very high fields, shows that the anisotropy at low temperature is rather
strong. Additionally, field dependent distortions to the symmetry of the torque
response in increasing applied fields shows that magnetostriction plays a large
role in determining the direction and magnitude of the anisotropy.

Densely distributed short pillar topography is the optimal geometry to prevent

simultaneous redshifted downflow at the location of the compact jet bright

neutral line at an edge of a negative-polarity network flux clump; (ii) during
the minifilament's fast-eruption onset and jet-spire onset, the JBP begins
brightening over the flux-cancelation neutral line. From IRIS2 inversion of the
Mg II spectra, the JBP's Mg II bright plasma has electron density, temperature,
and downward (red-shift) Doppler speed of 1012 cm^-3, 6000 K, and 10 kms,
respectively, and the growing spire shows clockwise spin. We speculate: (i)
during the slow rise of the erupting minifilament-carrying twisted flux rope,
the top of the erupting flux-rope loop, by writhing, makes its field direction
opposite that of encountered ambient far-reaching field; (ii) the erupting kink
then can reconnect with the far-reaching field to make the spire and reconnect
internally to make the JBP. We conclude that this coronal jet is normal in that

a novel View-Invariant Autoencoder for self-supervised skeleton action

action-specific `Motion' features on top of the visual representation of a 2D

geometry and camera view and allow ViA to facilitate both, cross-subject and
cross-view action classification tasks. We conduct a study focusing on
transfer-learning for skeleton-based action recognition with self-supervised

skeleton representations learned from ViA are generic enough to improve upon

  Let us consider a semilinear boundary value problem $ -\Delta u= f(x,u),$ in

between variables commonly exist, it is often of interest to infer the
interaction effects in the model. However, testing pairwise interactions among
millions of variables in complex and high-dimensional data suffers from low
statistical power and huge computational cost. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stage testing procedure with false discovery rate (FDR) control,
which is known as a less conservative multiple-testing correction.
Theoretically, the difficulty in the FDR control dues to the data dependence
among test statistics in two stages, and the fact that the number of hypothesis
tests conducted in the second stage depends on the screening result in the
first stage. By using the Cram\'er type moderate deviation technique, we show
that our procedure controls FDR at the desired level asymptotically in the
generalized linear model (GLM), where the model is allowed to be misspecified.
In addition, the asymptotic power of the FDR control procedure is rigorously
established. We demonstrate via comprehensive simulation studies that our
two-stage procedure is computationally more efficient than the classical BH
procedure, with a comparable or improved statistical power. Finally, we apply
the proposed method to a bladder cancer data from dbGaP where the scientific
goal is to identify genetic susceptibility loci for bladder cancer.

technique that aims to learn a useful representation function by pulling
positive samples close to each other while pushing negative samples far apart

introduced hard-negative unsupervised contrastive learning (H-UCL) that aims to
select the ""hard"" negative samples in contrast to a random sampling strategy
used in UCL. In another approach, under the assumption that the label
information is available, supervised contrastive learning (SCL) has developed
recently by extending the UCL to a fully-supervised setting. In this paper,
motivated by the effectiveness of hard-negative sampling strategies in H-UCL
and the usefulness of label information in SCL, we propose a contrastive
learning framework called hard-negative supervised contrastive learning
(H-SCL). Our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of H-SCL over both
SCL and H-UCL on several image datasets. In addition, we theoretically prove
that, under certain conditions, the objective function of H-SCL can be bounded
by the objective function of H-UCL but not by the objective function of UCL.
Thus, minimizing the H-UCL loss can act as a proxy to minimize the H-SCL loss
while minimizing UCL loss cannot. As we numerically showed that H-SCL
outperforms other contrastive learning methods, our theoretical result
(bounding H-SCL loss by H-UCL loss) helps to explain why H-UCL outperforms UCL
in practice.

vehicles travel in a single file, in close distance, and at the same velocity.
The platoon formation is autonomously maintained by a Cooperative Adaptive
Cruise Control (CACC) system which relies on sensory data and
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. In fact, V2V messages play a critical
role in shortening the platooning distance while maintaining safety. Whereas
V2V message integrity and source authentication can be verified via
cryptographic methods, establishing the truthfulness of the message contents is
a much harder task.
  This work establishes a physical access control mechanism to restrict V2V
messages to platooning members. Specifically, we aim at tying the digital
identity of a candidate requesting to join a platoon to its physical trajectory
relative to the platoon. We propose the {\em Wiggle} protocol that employs a
physical challenge-response exchange to prove that a candidate requesting to be
admitted into a platoon actually follows it. The protocol name is inspired by
the random longitudinal movements that the candidate is challenged to execute.
{\em Wiggle} prevents any remote adversary from joining the platoon and
injecting fake CACC messages. Compared to prior works, {\em Wiggle} is
resistant to pre-recording attacks and can verify that the candidate is
directly behind the verifier at the same lane.

ensuring positive invariance of a predefined safe set. One approach to ensuring
safety is to construct a Control Barrier Function (CBF) such that the system is
safe when the CBF is nonnegative, and then choose a control input to ensure
nonnegativity of the CBF at each time step, provided that such an input exists.
This paper investigates the problems of verification and synthesis of control

Positivstellensatz to construct convex equivalent conditions for a CBF to
ensure safety. We extend these conditions to control policies based on unions
and intersections of CBFs, high-order CBFs, and systems with trigonometric
dynamics, actuation constraints, and Euler-Lagrange dynamics. In the area of
synthesis, we propose algorithms for constructing CBFs, namely, an

pixel-accuracy while benefiting from volumetric integration in the
optimization. To this aim, depths are optimized by evaluating, at each 3D
location within the volumetric discretization, the agreement between the depth
prediction consistency and the photometric consistency for the corresponding
pixels. The optimization is agnostic to the associated photo-consistency term

different mixing conditions using a model system of n-heptane and asphaltene in
toluene. The external mixing between the asphaltene solution and the paraffinic
solvent is strictly controlled. We employed a high-spatial-resolution total
internal reflection fluorescence microscope to detect asphaltene precipitates
with a resolution up to 200 nm. A multiphysics model is used to simulate the
evolution of the oversaturation pulse in the solvent exchange process. Based on
the simulation results, we predicted the effect of the flow rate, dimension,
the orientation of the microfluidic chamber, and temperature on the surface
coverage and size distribution of asphaltene precipitates. The model
predictions of all factors corroborate with the experimental observations.
Local concentration of the solvent and shear forces are found to be the two
main reasons for the change of asphaltene precipitation caused by mixing
dynamics. However, the influence of thermodynamics is more critical than the
mixing dynamics as temperature changes. Through a combination of experimental
and simulation studies, this work illuminates the significance of the
transportation process for the final morphology of asphaltene precipitates and
provides an in-depth insight into the mechanism of mixing dynamics on the
asphaltene precipitation. A smart mixing may be to boost new phase formation
without excessive solvent consumption.

treatments of bound and unbound states. The position-space quantum Monte Carlo
(QMC) methods have a long history of successful bound state calculations in
light systems but so far have seen very little application to unbound systems.
Here we introduce a numerical method to improve the efficiency and accuracy of
unbound-state calculations in QMC, and as an initial application we compute
scattering observables for the neutron-triton system using variational Monte
Carlo (VMC) wave functions. The method consists of inferring long-range
amplitudes in the wave function from integrals over the short-ranged region
where all the particles interact. This approach using integral relations is
well established in the literature; here we develop it for the QMC framework.
We validate our code with a consistency check between short-range spectroscopic
overlap functions computed from direct evaluation and from the integral
relations; scattering amplitudes are long-range asymptotics of those overlaps.
Comparison against published benchmark calculations using the same potential
demonstrates that the integral method, when applied to the current VMC wave
functions, produces more accurate scattering observables than direct evaluation
from the same variational wave function. However, it still differs noticeably
from exact results. We then present phase shifts and mixing parameters for the
neutron-triton system using various interactions. Application of the integral
method here paves the way for its use in Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC)
calculations. In GFMC the wave functions are more precise, but high-precision
convergence of their tails is slow, and there are additional difficulties in
reading out amplitudes. The integral methods will address both of those
remaining problems.

has not been used to simulate airplane aerodynamics, despite its advantage of
allowing coarser grids. This may be credited to the failure of the uncorrected

improved results, suggesting those limitations are part of the past. For the

are observed near the intersection of surfaces, because the circulation
generated in the numerical simulation differs from the calculated corrected
circulation. A vorticity magnitude correction is proposed, which improves the
agreement between ALM and LL. This second-order correction resolves the

indicate that the improved ALM can be used for airplane aerodynamics, with an
accuracy similar to the LL.

progression, has been acknowledged as an efficient way to reduce the
overtreatment of prostate cancer. Most AS cohorts use fixed biopsy schedules
for all patients. However, the ideal test frequency remains unknown, and the
routine use of such invasive tests burdens the patients. An emerging idea is to
generate personalized biopsy schedules based on each patient's
progression-specific risk. To achieve that, we propose the interval-censored
cause-specific joint model (ICJM), which models the impact of longitudinal
biomarkers on cancer progression while considering the competing event of early
treatment initiation. The underlying likelihood function incorporates the
interval-censoring of cancer progression, the competing risk of treatment, and
the uncertainty about whether cancer progression occurred since the last biopsy
in patients that are right-censored or experience the competing event. The
model can produce patient-specific risk profiles until a horizon time. If the
risk exceeds a certain threshold, a biopsy is conducted. The optimal threshold
can be chosen by balancing two indicators of the biopsy schedules: the expected
number of biopsies and expected delay in detection of cancer progression. A
simulation study showed that our personalized schedules could considerably
reduce the number of biopsies per patient by 34%-54% compared to the fixed
schedules, though at the cost of a slightly longer detection delay.

individually suboptimal strategy to benefit the aggregate farm, has
demonstrated potential to reduce wake interactions and increase farm energy
production. However, existing wake models used for flow control often estimate
the thrust and power of yaw misaligned turbines using simplified empirical
expressions which require expensive calibration data and do not accurately
extrapolate between turbine models. The thrust, wake velocity deficit, wake
deflection, and power of a yawed wind turbine depend on its induced velocity.
Here, we extend classical one-dimensional momentum theory to model the
induction of a yaw misaligned actuator disk. Analytical expressions for the
induction, thrust, initial wake velocities, and power are developed as a
function of the yaw angle and thrust coefficient. The analytical model is
validated against large eddy simulations of a yawed actuator disk. Because the
induction depends on the yaw and thrust coefficient, the power generated by a
yawed actuator disk will always be greater than a $\cos^3(\gamma)$ model
suggests, where $\gamma$ is yaw. The power lost by yaw depends on the thrust
coefficient. An analytical expression for the thrust coefficient that maximizes
power, depending on the yaw, is developed and validated. Finally, using the
developed induction model as an initial condition for a turbulent far-wake
model, we demonstrate how combining wake steering and thrust (induction)
control can increase array power, compared to either independent steering or
induction control, due to the joint dependence of the induction on the thrust
coefficient and yaw angle.

test various interpretations of the anomalies. From this procedure, we find two
previously unidentified candidate planetary lensing events KMT-2017-BLG-0673

KMT-2017-BLG-0673 was produced by the source crossing over a planet-induced
caustic, but it was previously missed because of the sparse coverage of the
signal. On the other hand, the possibly planetary signal of KMT-2019-BLG-0414
was generated without caustic crossing, and it was previously missed due to the
weakness of the signal. We identify a unique planetary solution for

planetary solutions, for each of which there are two solutions caused by the
close-wide degeneracy, and a slightly less favored binary-source solution, in
which a single lens mass gravitationally magnified a rapidly orbiting binary
source with a faint companion (xallarap). From Bayesian analyses, it is
estimated that the planet KMT-2017-BLG-0673Lb has a mass of
$3.7^{+2.2}_{-2.1}~M_{\rm J}$, and it is orbiting a late K-type host star with
a mass of $0.63^{+0.37}_{-0.35}~M_\odot$. Under the planetary interpretation of
KMT-2010-BLG-0414L, a star with a mass of $0.74^{+0.43}_{-0.38}~M_\odot$ hosts
a planet with a mass of $\sim 3.2$--3.6~$M_{\rm J}$ depending on the solution.

the first system discovered with a 3:2 mean motion resonance (MMR). Several
competing migration theories with different predictions have previously
provided explanations regarding the observed resonance through dynamical
simulations that utilized limited data. Here, over ten years since the original
discovery, we revisit the system with a substantially increased radial velocity
(RV) sample from HARPS and HIRES that significantly extend the observational
baseline. We present the revised orbital solutions for the two planets using
both Keplerian and dynamical models. Our RV models suggest orbits that are more
circular and separated than those previously reported. As a result, predicted
strong planet-planet interactions were not detected. The system dynamics were
reanalyzed, and the planet pair was found to exhibit apsidal behavior of both
libration and circulation, indicating a quasi-resonance state rather than being
truly in MMR. The new orbital solution and dynamical state of the system
confirm migration models that predicted near circular orbits as the preferred
scenario. We also study the habitability prospects of this system and found
that an additional Earth-mass planet and exomoons in the HZ are possible. This
work showcases the importance of continued RV observation and its impact on our
knowledge of the system's dynamical history. HD 45364 continues to be an

becomes a visible effect starting only from $Z \sim 300$. With further growth

unambiguous detection. For such $Z$ the appearing picture of spontaneous

processing and are solved using a variety of resampling and filtering
techniques, which often involve making decisions on how to select training data
or decide which test examples should be labeled by the model. We examine the
tradeoffs in model performance involved in choices of training sample and
filter training and test data in heavily imbalanced token classification task
and examine the relationship between the magnitude of these tradeoffs and the
base rate of the phenomenon of interest. In experiments on sequence tagging to
detect rare phenomena in English and Arabic texts, we find that different
methods of selecting training data bring tradeoffs in effectiveness and
efficiency. We also see that in highly imbalanced cases, filtering test data
using first-pass retrieval models is as important for model performance as
selecting training data. The base rate of a rare positive class has a clear
effect on the magnitude of the changes in performance caused by the selection
of training or test data. As the base rate increases, the differences brought
about by those choices decreases.

Moreover, several crucial insights involving both real and synthetic data

photonic mode from radiating into free space along a given spatial direction.
Polariton excitations derived from the strong radiation-matter interaction of a
BIC with an excitonic resonance inherit an ultralong radiative lifetime and
significant nonlinearities due to their hybrid nature. However, maximizing the
light-matter interaction in these structures remains challenging, especially
with 2D semiconductors, thus preventing the observation of room temperature
nonlinearities of BIC polaritons. Here we show a strong light-matter
interaction enhancement at room temperature by coupling monolayer WS2 excitons
to a BIC, while optimizing for the electric field strength at the monolayer
position through Bloch surface wave confinement. By acting on the grating
geometry, the coupling with the active material is maximized in an open and
flexible architecture, allowing to achieve a 100 meV photonic bandgap with the
BIC in a local energy minimum and a record 70 meV Rabi splitting. Our novel
architecture provides large room temperature optical nonlinearities, thus
paving the way to tunable BIC-based polariton devices with
topologically-protected robustness to fabrication imperfections.

the Young's seminormal forms for the symmetric groups. Quite amazingly, this
theory simultaneously captures the representation theory of the cyclotomic KLR

continuous electrolyte reduction at the anode did not lead to a major increase
in bulk electrode resistance. A series of post-test characterization provided

theory (Loureiro, Schekochihin, and Cowley, PoP2007) is numerically examined as
an initial value problem, where the inner and outer regions are seamlessly
solved under uniform resistivity. Hence, all regions are solved as the
resistive MHD (magnetohydrodynamics). To comprehensively study physically
acceptable perturbation solutions, the behaviors of the local maximum points
required for physically acceptable solutions and zero-crossing points, at which
\phi=0 and \psi=0, are examined. Eventually, the uniform resistivity assumed in
the outer region is shown to play an important role in improving some
conclusions derived from the theory. In conclusion, the upper limit
\lambda_{up} of the growth rate obtained in the improved (modified) LSC theory
is shown to be regulated by the Alfven speed measured in the outer region. It

the Lagrangian and non-trivial variation of the lower-dimensional part.
However, in general, separation between the dim-4 and lower-dimensional
Lagrangian is not invariant with respect to basis transformations of fields.
Therefore, a natural question of the physical meaning of soft symmetry breaking
arises. This problem is addressed here in the framework of two-Higgs-Doublet
Models (2HDM). It has been shown, within these models, that in spite of the
ambiguity corresponding to the separation between dim-4 and the lower-dimension
Lagrangian, implications of the soft symmetry breaking could be formulated in
terms of observables, i.e., they are physical and measurable. There are six
global symmetries that can be imposed on the scalar sector of the generic 2HDM.
Necessary and sufficient tree-level conditions for soft breaking of all of them
have been formulated in terms of observables.

across 5 decades. Our findings show that contextualized methods can often
predict high change scores for words which are not undergoing any real
diachronic semantic shift in the lexicographic sense of the term (or at least
the status of these shifts is questionable). Such challenging cases are
discussed in detail with examples, and their linguistic categorization is
proposed. Our conclusion is that pre-trained contextualized language models are
prone to confound changes in lexicographic senses and changes in contextual
variance, which naturally stem from their distributional nature, but is
different from the types of issues observed in methods based on static
embeddings. Additionally, they often merge together syntactic and semantic
aspects of lexical entities. We propose a range of possible future solutions to
these issues.

not available or too difficult to apply. Metamorphic testing is a testing
approach that uses metamorphic relations, which are necessary properties of the
software under test to help verify the correctness of a program. Prioritization
of metamorphic relations helps to reduce the cost of metamorphic testing [1].
However, prioritizing metamorphic relations based on code coverage is often not
effective for prioritizing MRs for machine learning programs, since the
decision logic of a machine learning model is learned from training data, and
100% code coverage can be easily achieved with a single test input. To this
end, in this work, we propose a cost-effective approach based on diversity in
the source and follow-up data set to prioritize metamorphic relations for
machine learning programs. We show that the proposed data diversity-based
prioritization approach increase the fault detection effectiveness by up to 40%
when compared to the code coverage-based approach and reduce the time taken to
detect a fault by 29% when compared to random execution of MRs. Overall, our
approach leads to saving time and cost during testing.

Z-interference channel was recently conjectured by Costa, Nair, Ng, and Wang to
be the global optimizer, which, if true, would imply the optimality of the
Han-Kobayashi region for the Gaussian Z-interference channel. This conjecture
was known to be true for some parameter regimes, but the validity for all
parameters, although suggested by Gaussian tensorization, was previously open.
In this paper we construct several counterexamples showing that this conjecture
may fail in certain regimes: A simple construction without Hermite polynomial
perturbation is proposed, where distributions far from Gaussian are
analytically shown to be better than the Gaussian stationary point. As
alternatives, we consider perturbation along geodesics under either the $L^2$
or Wasserstein-2 metric, showing that the Gaussian stationary point is unstable
in a certain regime. Similarity to stability of the Levy-Cramer theorem is
discussed. The stability phase transition point admits a simple
characterization in terms of the maximum eigenvalue of the Gaussian maximizer.
Similar to the Holley-Stroock principle, we can show that in the stable regime
the Gaussian stationary point is optimal in a neighborhood under the
$L^{\infty}$-norm with respect to the Gaussian measure. For protocols with
constant power control, our counterexamples imply Gaussian suboptimality for
the Han-Kobayashi region. Allowing variable power control, we show that the
Gaussian optimizers for the Han-Kobayashi region always lie in the stable
regime. We propose an amended conjecture, whose validity would imply Gaussian
optimality of the Han-Kobayashi bound in a certain regime.

speed adoption between vehicles. Limitations on platooning-oriented
communication range and number of vehicles in each platoon are applied to the
model to reflect real-world circumstances and avoid overlengthened platoons.
The SMD model control both intra-platoon and inter-platoon interactions.
Initial evaluation of the model reveals that the SMD model does not cause a
negative spacing error between AVs in a harsh deceleration scenario,
guaranteeing safety. Besides that, the SMD model produces a smaller positive
average spacing error than VISSIM built-in platooning module, which prevents
maximum throughput drop. The simulation result for a regular highway section

developed to facilitate the fitting of the new model to the massive Medicare

determination of optimal tuning parameters. Hypothesis testing procedures are
designed to examine whether the COVID-19 effect varies significantly with
postdischarge time and the time since pandemic onset, either jointly or

  Microarchitecture (MICRO), 2022",,,,"cs.AR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Long-latency load requests continue to limit the performance of
high-performance processors. To increase the latency tolerance of a processor,
architects have primarily relied on two key techniques: sophisticated data
prefetchers and large on-chip caches. In this work, we show that: 1) even a
sophisticated state-of-the-art prefetcher can only predict half of the off-chip
load requests on average across a wide range of workloads, and 2) due to the
increasing size and complexity of on-chip caches, a large fraction of the
latency of an off-chip load request is spent accessing the on-chip cache
hierarchy. The goal of this work is to accelerate off-chip load requests by
removing the on-chip cache access latency from their critical path. To this
end, we propose a new technique called Hermes, whose key idea is to: 1)
accurately predict which load requests might go off-chip, and 2) speculatively
fetch the data required by the predicted off-chip loads directly from the main
memory, while also concurrently accessing the cache hierarchy for such loads.
To enable Hermes, we develop a new lightweight, perceptron-based off-chip load
prediction technique that learns to identify off-chip load requests using
multiple program features (e.g., sequence of program counters). For every load
request, the predictor observes a set of program features to predict whether or
not the load would go off-chip. If the load is predicted to go off-chip, Hermes
issues a speculative request directly to the memory controller once the load's
physical address is generated. If the prediction is correct, the load
eventually misses the cache hierarchy and waits for the ongoing speculative
request to finish, thus hiding the on-chip cache hierarchy access latency from
the critical path of the off-chip load. Our evaluation shows that Hermes
significantly improves performance of a state-of-the-art baseline. We
open-source Hermes.

state-of-health (SOH) estimation has become dominant for lithium-ion batteries
(LiBs). To handle data discrepancy across batteries, current SOH estimation
models engage in transfer learning (TL), which reserves apriori knowledge
gained through reusing partial structures of the offline trained model.
However, multiple degradation patterns of a complete life cycle of a battery
make it challenging to pursue TL. The concept of the stage is introduced to
describe the collection of continuous cycles that present a similar degradation
pattern. A transferable multi-stage SOH estimation model is proposed to perform
TL across batteries in the same stage, consisting of four steps. First, with
identified stage information, raw cycling data from the source battery are
reconstructed into the phase space with high dimensions, exploring hidden
dynamics with limited sensors. Next, domain invariant representation across
cycles in each stage is proposed through cycling discrepancy subspace with
reconstructed data. Third, considering the unbalanced discharge cycles among
different stages, a switching estimation strategy composed of a lightweight
model with the long short-term memory network and a powerful model with the
proposed temporal capsule network is proposed to boost estimation accuracy.
Lastly, an updating scheme compensates for estimation errors when the cycling
consistency of target batteries drifts. The proposed method outperforms its
competitive algorithms in various transfer tasks for a run-to-failure benchmark

distances are employed instead of Euclidean distances. The resulting spherical
stress function is optimized by means of stochastic gradient descent.
Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the scalability and
effectiveness of the proposed method. We also show that some graph families can
be embedded with lower distortion on the sphere, than in Euclidean and

extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave at speeds of 740$-$860 km s$^{-1}$. The CME is
associated with a type II radio burst, implying that the EUV wave is a
fast-mode shock wave. During the impulsive phase, the flare shows
quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in EUV, hard X-ray, and radio wavelengths. The
periods of QPPs range from 18 s to 113 s, indicating that flare energy is
released and nonthermal electrons are accelerated intermittently with multiple
time scales. The interaction between the EUV wave and low-lying adjacent
coronal loops (ACLs) results in contraction, expansion, and transverse vertical
oscillation of ACLs. The speed of contraction in 171, 193, and 211 {\AA} is
higher than that in 304 {\AA}. The periods of oscillation are 253 s and 275 s

the interaction. The equation that interprets the contraction and oscillation
of the overlying coronal loops above a flare core can also interpret the

Without an effective data selection policy to filter the massive streaming data

bosonic quantum annealer is attributed to larger excitation gaps and the
consequent smoother adiabatic transformation of its instantaneous quantum

less affected by the glass order and explores the Hilbert space more
efficiently. Our theoretical finding could shed light on constructing atomic
quantum annealers using Rydberg atoms in optical lattices.

Cluster orientations determined in the two wavelengths are generally
consistent. The orientation alignment between BCGs and host clusters is
confirmed and more significant than previous works. We find that BCGs are more
aligned with cluster orientations measured in X-ray than those from optical

argue that the detected redshift evolution of the alignment is probably caused
by observational bias rather than intrinsic evolution. The alignment is not

Detectron2 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to demonstrate detection
and segmentation of vacant parking spots, we then add the parking lot's
corresponding longitude and latitude coordinates to recommend the most
convenient parking lot to the driver based on the Haversine distance and number
of available parking spots. Using the VGG Image Annotation (VIA) we use images
from an expanding dataset of images, and annotate these with polygon outlines
of the four different types of objects of interest: cars, open parking spots,
people, and car number plates. We use the segmentation model to ensure number
plates can be occluded in production for car registration anonymity purposes.
We get an 89% and 82% intersection over union cover score on cars and parking

congestion in and around shopping complexes and other public places, and
maximize people's utility with respect to driving on public roads.

power as a function of some parameters of a hypothesis test is desirable.
However, for most hypothesis tests, the explicit functional form of statistical
power for individual model parameters is unknown; but calculating power for a

Hence, developing the entire statistical power manifold using simulations can

task for industrial and academic communities. The lack of integration between
physical principles and data-driven models is an important reason for limiting
the development of this field. In the literature, physics-based methods can
usually provide a clear interpretation of the dynamic process of traffic flow
systems but are with limited accuracy, while data-driven methods, especially
deep learning with black-box structures, can achieve improved performance but
can not be fully trusted due to lack of a reasonable physical basis. To bridge
the gap between purely data-driven and physics-driven approaches, we propose a
physics-guided deep learning model named Spatio-Temporal Differential Equation
Network (STDEN), which casts the physical mechanism of traffic flow dynamics
into a deep neural network framework. Specifically, we assume the traffic flow
on road networks is driven by a latent potential energy field (like water flows
are driven by the gravity field), and model the spatio-temporal dynamic process
of the potential energy field as a differential equation network. STDEN absorbs
both the performance advantage of data-driven models and the interpretability
of physics-based models, so is named a physics-guided prediction model.
Experiments on three real-world traffic datasets in Beijing show that our model
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. A case study
further verifies that STDEN can capture the mechanism of urban traffic and
generate accurate predictions with physical meaning. The proposed framework of
differential equation network modeling may also cast light on other similar
applications.

structure that consists of objects, parts, and their relations. Despite their
potential, they are computationally expensive and pose a major drawback, which
limits utilizing these networks efficiently on more complex datasets. The
current CapsNet models only compare their performance with the capsule
baselines and do not perform at the same level as deep CNN-based models on
complicated tasks. This paper proposes an efficient way for learning capsules
that detect atomic parts of an input image, through a group of SubCapsules,
upon which an input vector is projected. Subsequently, we present the
Wasserstein Embedding Module that first measures the dissimilarity between the
input and components modeled by the SubCapsules, and then finds their degree of
alignment based on the learned optimal transport. This strategy leverages new
insights on defining alignment between the input and SubCapsules based on the
similarity between their respective component distributions. Our proposed
model, (i) is lightweight and allows to apply capsules for more complex vision
tasks; (ii) performs better than or at par with CNN-based models on these
challenging tasks. Our experimental results indicate that Wasserstein Embedding
Capsules (WECapsules) perform more robustly on affine transformations,
effectively scale up to larger datasets, and outperform the CNN and CapsNet
models in several vision tasks.

  in the Fourier Space","Accepted to ACM MM 2022, 9 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Human motion transfer refers to synthesizing photo-realistic and temporally
coherent videos that enable one person to imitate the motion of others.
However, current synthetic videos suffer from the temporal inconsistency in
sequential frames that significantly degrades the video quality, yet is far
from solved by existing methods in the pixel domain. Recently, some works on
DeepFake detection try to distinguish the natural and synthetic images in the
frequency domain because of the frequency insufficiency of image synthesizing
methods. Nonetheless, there is no work to study the temporal inconsistency of
synthetic videos from the aspects of the frequency-domain gap between natural
and synthetic videos. In this paper, we propose to delve into the frequency
space for temporally consistent human motion transfer. First of all, we make
the first comprehensive analysis of natural and synthetic videos in the
frequency domain to reveal the frequency gap in both the spatial dimension of
individual frames and the temporal dimension of the video. To close the
frequency gap between the natural and synthetic videos, we propose a novel
Frequency-based human MOtion TRansfer framework, named FreMOTR, which can
effectively mitigate the spatial artifacts and the temporal inconsistency of
the synthesized videos. FreMOTR explores two novel frequency-based
regularization modules: 1) the Frequency-domain Appearance Regularization (FAR)
to improve the appearance of the person in individual frames and 2) Temporal
Frequency Regularization (TFR) to guarantee the temporal consistency between
adjacent frames. Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the
FreMOTR not only yields superior performance in temporal consistency metrics
but also improves the frame-level visual quality of synthetic videos. In
particular, the temporal consistency metrics are improved by nearly 30% than
the state-of-the-art model.

579-594). This work discusses three cases of kernels $\beta_q(t)$ included in
the integrals for the multi-term VIDEs, from which we use corresponding
numerical techniques to approximate the solution of multi-term VIDEs in
different cases. Firstly, for the case of $\beta_1(t), \beta_2(t) \in
\mathrm{L}_1(\mathbb{R}_+)$, the Crank-Nicolson (CN) method and interpolation
quadrature (IQ) rule are applied to time-discrete solutions of the multi-term
VIDEs; secondly, for the case of $\beta_1(t)\in \mathrm{L}_1(\mathbb{R}_+)$ and
$\beta_2(t)\in \mathrm{L}_{1,\text{loc}}(\mathbb{R}_+)$, second-order backward
differentiation formula (BDF2) and second-order convolution quadrature (CQ) are
employed to discretize the multi-term problem in the time direction; thirdly,
for the case of $\beta_1(t), \beta_2(t)\in
\mathrm{L}_{1,\text{loc}}(\mathbb{R}_+)$, we utilize the CN method and
trapezoidal CQ (TCQ) rule to approximate temporally the multi-term problem.
Then for the discrete solution of three cases, the long-time global stability
and convergence are proved based on the z-transform and certain appropriate
assumptions. Furthermore, the long-time estimate of the third case is confirmed
by the numerical tests.

learning. The simplest problems are binary and multiclass classification and

function, which is the means by which the quality of a solution is evaluated.
In this paper we systematically develop the theory of loss functions for such
problems from a novel perspective whose basic ingredients are convex sets with
a particular structure. The loss function is defined as the subgradient of the
support function of the convex set. It is consequently automatically proper
(calibrated for probability estimation). This perspective provides three novel
opportunities. It enables the development of a fundamental relationship between
losses and (anti)-norms that appears to have not been noticed before. Second,
it enables the development of a calculus of losses induced by the calculus of
convex sets which allows the interpolation between different losses, and thus
is a potential useful design tool for tailoring losses to particular problems.
In doing this we build upon, and considerably extend, existing results on
M-sums of convex sets. Third, the perspective leads to a natural theory of
`polar' (or `inverse') loss functions, which are derived from the polar dual of
the convex set defining the loss, and which form a natural universal
substitution function for Vovk's aggregating algorithm.

law in one space dimension. It is well known that even for smooth initial data
the solution can become discontinuous in finite time and global entropy weak
solution can best lie in the space of bounded total variations. It is
impossible that the solutions belong to ,for example ,$H^1$ because by Sobolev
embedding theorem $H^1$ functions are H$\mathrm{\ddot{o}}$lder continuous.
However, we note that from any point $(t,x)$ we can draw a generalized
characteristic downward which meets the initial axis at $y=\alpha (t,x)$. if we
regard $u$ as a function of $(t,y)$, it indeed belongs to $H^1$ as a function
of $y$ if the initial data belongs to $H^1$. We may call this generalized
persistence (of high regularity) of the entropy weak solutions. The main
purpose of this paper is to prove some kinds of generalized persistence (of

Frustratingly easy but Effective Approach (FEA) method with two learning stages
for CRE: 1) Fast Adaption (FA) warms up the model with only new data. 2)
Balanced Tuning (BT) finetunes the model on the balanced memory data. Despite
its simplicity, FEA achieves comparable (on TACRED or superior (on FewRel)
performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines. With careful
examinations, we find that the data imbalance between new and old relations
leads to a skewed decision boundary in the head classifiers over the pretrained
encoders, thus hurting the overall performance. In FEA, the FA stage unleashes
the potential of memory data for the subsequent finetuning, while the BT stage
helps establish a more balanced decision boundary. With a unified view, we find
that two strong CRE baselines can be subsumed into the proposed training
pipeline. The success of FEA also provides actionable insights and suggestions
for future model designing in CRE.

  Assessment",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The visual quality of point clouds has been greatly emphasized since the
ever-increasing 3D vision applications are expected to provide cost-effective
and high-quality experiences for users. Looking back on the development of
point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) methods, the visual quality is usually
evaluated by utilizing single-modal information, i.e., either extracted from
the 2D projections or 3D point cloud. The 2D projections contain rich texture
and semantic information but are highly dependent on viewpoints, while the 3D
point clouds are more sensitive to geometry distortions and invariant to
viewpoints. Therefore, to leverage the advantages of both point cloud and
projected image modalities, we propose a novel no-reference point cloud quality
assessment (NR-PCQA) metric in a multi-modal fashion. In specific, we split the
point clouds into sub-models to represent local geometry distortions such as
point shift and down-sampling. Then we render the point clouds into 2D image
projections for texture feature extraction. To achieve the goals, the
sub-models and projected images are encoded with point-based and image-based
neural networks. Finally, symmetric cross-modal attention is employed to fuse
multi-modal quality-aware information. Experimental results show that our
approach outperforms all compared state-of-the-art methods and is far ahead of
previous NR-PCQA methods, which highlights the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The code is available at https://github.com/zzc-1998/MM-PCQA.

black holes in the holographic axion gravity. The solutions correspond to a new
class of charged black holes, because the boundary diffeomorphism is broken due
to the graviton mass induced by the axion fields in the bulk. The information
theoretical aspects of these black hole solutions is determined upon applying
the island rule for the entanglement entropy. Like non-extremal charged black
holes, the radiation entropy grows linearly in the no-island configurations,
while is saturated at late times by asymptotic values set by the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in the island configurations, with the boundary
being located slightly outside the outer horizon. In particular, for the
extremal black planes of holographic axion gravity, we find that: (a) the
entanglement entropy of the Hawking radiation is ill-defined at the early times
when the island is absent; (b) it tends to a distinctive constant at the late
times; (c) the late-time location of the island is indeed universal. Moreover,
we investigate how the Page time is affected by the holographic massive gravity
deformation. For neutral solutions at the small deformation parameter, and for
charged solutions with almost-extremal deformation parameter, we find that the
Page transition happens at earlier times.

from a surface remain unclear. In the present study, we explored this issue by
constructing an apparatus that allows us to direct a spin-polarized He* beam to
a surface and measure the spin polarization of He* scattered from the surface.
Magnetic hexapoles were used for both the beam polarization and the spin
analysis. The results of the spin-dependent He* scattering experiments on clean
Fe$_3$O$_4$(100), H-terminated Fe$_3$O$_4$(100), benzene-adsorbed
Fe$_3$O$_4$(100), and non-magnetic Cu(100) surfaces indicated that although the
spin direction of He* was mostly preserved during scattering from these
surfaces, spin-flop scattering of surviving He* occurred with a probability up
to approximately 0.1. Our results showed that the survival probability was
higher when the spins of He* and the Fe$_3$O$_4$(100) film were parallel, which
can be understood based on the lower He* resonance ionization rate for this
spin orientation. Based on our findings, we estimate that a non-polarized He*
gas becomes 10% spin-polarized after a single collision with a clean
Fe$_3$O$_4$(100) surface.

arrives, the packet payload will be processed by the PELAT language model with
a downstream classifier to predict its tactics. In this way, we can effectively
reduce the burden of manually labeling big datasets. In a one-week honeypot

years. The user identity linkage (UIL) task, aiming at finding corresponding
users across different social networks, would be a threat to privacy if
unethically applied. The sensitive user information might be detected through
connected identities. A promising and novel solution to this issue is to design
an adversarial strategy to degrade the matching performance of UIL models.
However, most existing adversarial attacks on graphs are designed for models
working in a single network, while UIL is a cross-network learning task.
Meanwhile, privacy protection against UIL works unilaterally in real-world
scenarios, i.e., the service provider can only add perturbations to its own
network to protect its users from being linked. To tackle these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel adversarial attack strategy that poisons one target
network to prevent its nodes from being linked to other networks by UIL
algorithms. Specifically, we reformalize the UIL problem in the perspective of
kernelized topology consistency and convert the attack objective to maximizing
the structural changes within the target network before and after attacks. A
novel graph kernel is then defined with Earth mover's distance (EMD) on the
edge-embedding space. In terms of efficiency, a fast attack strategy is
proposed by greedy searching and replacing EMD with its lower bound. Results on
three real-world datasets indicate that the proposed attacks can best fool a
wide range of UIL models and reach a balance between attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility.

image classification task with both long-tailed distribution and label noise.
Existing noise-robust learning methods cannot work in this scenario as it is
challenging to differentiate noisy samples from clean samples of tail classes.
To deal with this problem, we propose a new learning paradigm based on matching
between inferences on weak and strong data augmentations to screen out noisy
samples and introduce a leave-noise-out regularization to eliminate the effect
of the recognized noisy samples. Furthermore, we incorporate a novel prediction
penalty based on online prior distribution to avoid bias towards head classes.
This mechanism has superiority in capturing the class fitting degree in
realtime compared to the existing long-tail classification methods. Exhaustive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art
algorithms that address the distribution imbalance problem in long-tailed
classification under noisy labels.

very predictive framework in which the $U_1$ couplings and the Yukawa couplings
find a common origin via mixing of chiral quarks and leptons with vector-like

vector-like fermion families, in the massless first family approximation, and
show that the second and third family charged fermion masses and mixings and
the $B$-anomalies can be simultaneously explained and related. The model has
the proper flavour structure to be compatible with all low-energy observables,
and leads to predictions in promising observables such as
$\tau\rightarrow3\mu$, $\tau\rightarrow\mu\gamma$ and $B\rightarrow

spectrum of TeV scale gauge bosons and vector-like fermions, all accessible to

still explain the $R_{D^{(*)}}$ anomalies at 1$\sigma$ in a narrow window,

be tested in the future via more precise measurements by the LHCb

shifting the world averages to slightly smaller central values.

aims to localize the desired video fragments from spoken language descriptions.
Compared with using text, employing audio requires the model to directly
exploit the useful phonemes and syllables related to the video from raw speech.
Moreover, we randomly add environmental noises to this speech audio, further
increasing the difficulty of this task and better simulating real applications.
To rectify the discriminative phonemes and extract video-related information
from noisy audio, we develop a novel video-guided curriculum learning (VGCL)
during the audio pre-training process, which can make use of the vital visual
perceptions to help understand the spoken language and suppress the external
noise. Considering during inference the model can not obtain ground truth video
segments, we design a curriculum strategy that gradually shifts the input video
from the ground truth to the entire video content during pre-training. Finally,
the model can learn how to extract critical visual information from the entire
video clip to help understand the spoken language. In addition, we collect the
first large-scale spoken video grounding dataset based on ActivityNet, which is
named as ActivityNet Speech dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
proposed video-guided curriculum learning can facilitate the pre-training

performance of spoken video grounding tasks. Moreover, we prove that in the

Furthermore, we predict their impact on searches for an isotropic
gravitational-wave background, as well as for searches looking for
short-duration transient gravitational waves, both unmodeled signals (bursts)
as well as modeled signals (compact binary coalescence). Whereas the recent
third observing run by LIGO and Virgo was free of an impact from correlated
magnetic field fluctuations, future runs could be affected. For example, at
current magnetic coupling levels, neutron star inspirals in third generation
detectors are likely to be contaminated by multiple correlated lightning
glitches. We suggest that future detector design should consider reducing
lightning coupling by, for example, reducing the lightning-induced beam tube
currents that pass through sensitive magnetic coupling regions in current

(C-index>-0.2) and galaxies with centrally concentrated star-formation
(SF-concentrated; C-index<-0.2). Concentrated star-formation is a potential
indicator of galaxies currently undergoing `outside-in' quenching. Our
environments cover ungrouped galaxies, low-mass groups (M_200<10^12.5 M_sun),
high-mass groups (M_200 in the range 10^{12.5-14} M_sun) and clusters
(M_200>10^14 M_sun). We find the fraction of SF-concentrated galaxies increases
as halo mass increases with 9\pm2 per cent, 8\pm3 per cent, 19\pm4 per cent and
29\pm4 per cent for ungrouped galaxies, low-mass groups, high-mass groups and
clusters, respectively. We interpret these results as evidence for `outside-in'
quenching in groups and clusters. To investigate the quenching time-scale in
SF-concentrated galaxies, we calculate light-weighted age (Age_L) and
mass-weighted age (Age_M) using full spectral fitting, as well as the Dn4000
and Hdelta_A indices. We assume that the average galaxy age radial profile
before entering a group or cluster is similar to ungrouped regular galaxies. At
large radius (1-2 R_e), SF-concentrated galaxies in high-mass groups have older
ages than ungrouped regular galaxies with an age difference of 1.83\pm0.38 Gyr
for Age_L and 1.34\pm0.56 Gyr for Age_M. This suggests that while `outside-in'
quenching can be effective in groups, the process will not quickly quench the
entire galaxy. In contrast, the ages at 1-2 R_e of cluster SF-concentrated
galaxies and ungrouped regular galaxies are consistent (0.19\pm0.21 Gyr for

standard matrix eigenvalue problem of toroidal and poloidal streamfunctions,
solving perturbation velocity eigenmodes with their complex growth rate as
eigenvalues. This reduces the problem size for computation and distributes
collocation points adjustably clustered around the vortex core. Based on this
method, strong swirling $q$-vortices with linear perturbation wavenumbers of
order unity are examined. Without viscosity, neutrally stable eigenmodes
associated with the continuous eigenvalue spectrum having critical-layer
singularities are successfully resolved. The inviscid critical-layer eigenmodes
numerically tend to appear in pairs, implying their singular degeneracy. With
viscosity, the spectra pertaining to physical regularisation of critical layers
stretch out toward an area, referring to potential eigenmodes with wavepackets
found by Mao & Sherwin (2011). However, the potential eigenmodes exhibit no
spatial similarity to the inviscid critical-layer eigenmodes, doubting that
they truly represent the viscous remnants of the inviscid critical-layer
eigenmodes. Instead, two distinct continuous curves in the numerical spectra

where the similarity is noticeable. Moreover, the viscous critical-layer
eigenmodes are resolved in conformity with the $Re^{-1/3}$ scaling law. The

in the first, a path for the PAP and feasible positions for the IRS modules are
found using a multi-tier circle packing method, and the required IRS phase
shift values are calculated using an alternate optimization method that
considers the interdependence between the amplitude and phase responses of an
IRS element; in the second phase, the PAP flying velocity and user scheduling

that the surface potential well produced by the penetrating magnetic field

Specifically, the electron density near the surface increases with the magnetic

that changes in Tc are tunable with hopping anisotropy and depend on the
orientation of the gap function in relation to the opening of the Fermi surface
during the Lifshitz transition. In comparing the model results to experimental

this paper, we create a new branch of BD-RIS supporting a multi-sector mode. A
multi-sector BD-RIS is modeled as multiple antennas connected to a multi-port
group-connected reconfigurable impedance network. More specifically, antennas
are divided into $L$ ($L \ge 2$) sectors and arranged as a polygon prism with
each sector covering $1/L$ space. Different from the recently introduced
concept of intelligent omni-surface (or simultaneously transmitting and
reflecting RIS), the multi-sector BD-RIS not only achieves a full-space

directional beam of each sector.We derive the constraint of the multi-sector
BD-RIS and the corresponding channel model taking into account the relationship
between antenna beamwidth and gain. With the proposed model, we first derive
the scaling law of the received signal power for a multi-sector BD-RIS-assisted

maximize the sum-rate of the multi-sector BD-RIS-assisted multiuser system.

month periods and amplitudes of ~400 km. Here, the mechanism driving these
oscillations is revealed by considering vorticity-gradient forces generated by
mutual interactions between the cyclones and the latitudinal variation in
planetary vorticity. Data-driven estimation of these forces exhibits a high
correlation with the measured acceleration of the cyclones. To further test
this mechanism, a model is constructed, simulating how cyclones subject to
these forces exhibit similar oscillatory motion.

real-time voltage capture which provides us with the largest sample of

yields accurately measured FRB scattering timescales. We combine the UTMOST
FRBs with 10 FRBs from the literature and find no obvious evidence for a
DM-scattering relation, suggesting that IGM is not the dominant source of

cases they can become so strong, that the whole star is cloaked by an optically
thick wind. The strong outflow gives rise to large emission lines, defining the
class of so-called Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. While being major players in the
evolution of massive stars, the formation of heavy black holes,and the
distribution of elements, the occurrence and nature of WR winds is still quite
enigmatic.
  A promising instrument towards a better theoretical understanding are stellar
atmospheres allowing for a consistent inclusion of the hydrodynamics. By
coupling stellar and wind parameters and the inclusion of a detailed non-LTE
radiative transfer, they allow us to go beneath the observable layers and study
the onset of WR-type winds. Establishing larger sets of models, we were able to
make ground-breaking progress by identifying trends with mass and metallicity
that deviate significantly from present empirical descriptions. Our modelling
efforts reveal a complex picture for WR-type winds with strong, non-linear
dependencies. Besides covering metallicity and mass, we further identify
surface hydrogen as an important ingredient to retain WR-type mass loss at
lower metallicity. Here, we present a summary of recent insights on the nature
and onset of WR-type winds in massive stars including the consequences for
stellar evolution, remaining open questions, and current efforts to overcome
them.

training data limits the capabilities of these algorithms in scenarios where
such input is scarce or expensive. Self-supervised learning offers a way to
lower the need for manually annotated data by pretraining models for a specific
domain on unlabelled data. In this approach, labelled data are solely required
to fine-tune models for downstream tasks. Medical image segmentation is a field
where labelling data requires expert knowledge and collecting large labelled
datasets is challenging; therefore, self-supervised learning algorithms promise
substantial improvements in this field. Despite this, self-supervised learning
algorithms are used rarely to pretrain medical image segmentation networks. In
this paper, we elaborate and analyse the effectiveness of supervised and
self-supervised pretraining approaches on downstream medical image
segmentation, focusing on convergence and data efficiency. We find that
self-supervised pretraining on natural images and target-domain-specific images
leads to the fastest and most stable downstream convergence. In our experiments
on the ACDC cardiac segmentation dataset, this pretraining approach achieves
4-5 times faster fine-tuning convergence compared to an ImageNet pretrained
model. We also show that this approach requires less than five epochs of
pretraining on domain-specific data to achieve such improvement in the
downstream convergence time. Finally, we find that, in low-data scenarios,
supervised ImageNet pretraining achieves the best accuracy, requiring less than
100 annotated samples to realise close to minimal error.

Recent developments have adapted low-rank data approximation methods by

challenges within EHR data such as high dimensionality, data sparsity and
incompleteness. Especially extracting temporal phenotypes from longitudinal EHR

regarding their application for channel assignment problems in multiconnective

such algorithms grows fast with the number of users and resources. Therefore,
preallocation-based CA represents a promising approach for these setups. The
aim of preallocation is to constrain the number of bids submitted by
participants in the CA process, thus allow the numerical feasibility of the
auction problem. Reduction of bid number is achieved via limiting the number of
items (in our case channels) considered by auction participants (tenants) in
their bids. Thus the aim of preallocation is to non-exclusively assign channels
to tenants, which assignment serves as a basis for the later bid generation in
the CA procedure. In this paper we compare the performance of various
preallocation approaches via simulation according to various measures, namely
the total utility of the resulting allocation, the number of unassigned

conversion due to their high spin-orbit coupling and lack of inversion symmetry
in their crystal structure. However, reports of direct measurement of
spin-to-charge conversion at TMD-based interfaces are very much limited. Here,
we report on the room temperature observation of a large spin-to-charge
conversion arising from the interface of Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) and four
distinct large area ($\sim 5\times2$~mm$^2$) monolayer (ML) TMDs namely,
MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$. We show that both spin mixing
conductance and the Rashba efficiency parameter ($\lambda_{IREE}$) scales with
the spin-orbit coupling strength of the ML TMD layers. The $\lambda_{IREE}$
parameter is found to range between $-0.54$ and $-0.76$ nm for the four
monolayer TMDs, demonstrating a large spin-to-charge conversion. Our findings
reveal that TMD/ferromagnet interface can be used for efficient generation and
detection of spin current, opening new opportunities for novel spintronic

(contractile) activity endows the comet-like $+1/2$ defect with a finite
vorticity that drives the defect to align its nose in the direction of
decreasing (increasing) gradient. A constant gradient does not, however, affect
the known self-propulsion of the $+1/2$ defect and has no effect on the $-1/2$
that remains a non-motile particle. A sharp jump in activity acts like a wall
that traps the defects, affecting the translational and rotational motion of
both charges. The $+1/2$ defect slows down as it approaches the interface and
the net vorticity tends to reorient the defect polarization so that it becomes
perpendicular to the interface. The $-1/2$ defect acquires a self-propulsion
towards the activity interface, while the vorticity-induced active torque tends
to align the defect to a preferred orientation. This effective attraction of
the negative defects to the wall is consistent with the observation of an
accumulation of negative topological charge at both active/passive interfaces
and physical boundaries.

proposes the use of probing strategies and integrates them into a
traversability analysis framework to address safe navigation on unknown rough
terrain. Our framework integrates collapsibility information into our existing
traversability analysis, as vision and geometric information alone could be
misled by unpredictable non-rigid terrains such as soft soil, bush area, or
water puddles. With the new traversability analysis framework, our robot has a
more comprehensive assessment of unpredictable terrain, which is critical for
its safety in outdoor environments. The pipeline first identifies the terrain's
geometric and semantic properties using an RGB-D camera and desired probing
locations on questionable terrains. These regions are probed using a force
sensor to determine the risk of terrain collapsing when the robot steps over
it. This risk is formulated as a collapsibility metric, which estimates an
unpredictable region's ground collapsibility. Thereafter, the collapsibility
metric, together with geometric and semantic spatial data, is combined and
analyzed to produce global and local traversability grid maps. These
traversability grid maps tell the robot whether it is safe to step over
different regions of the map. The grid maps are then utilized to generate
optimal paths for the robot to safely navigate to its goal. Our approach has
been successfully verified on a quadrupedal robot in both simulation and
real-world experiments.

equations in different regimes of the Froude number making use of general
polygonal meshes. The fluxes of the governing equations are split such that
advection and acoustic-gravity sub-systems are derived, hence separating slow
and fast phenomena. This splitting allows the nonlinear convective fluxes to be
discretized explicitly in time, while retaining an implicit time marching for
the acoustic-gravity terms. Consequently, the novel schemes are particularly
well suited in the low Froude limit of the model, since no numerical viscosity
is added in the implicit solver. Besides, stability follows from a milder CFL
condition which is based only on the advection speed and not on the celerity.
High order time accuracy is achieved using the family of semi-implicit IMEX
Runge-Kutta schemes, while high order in space is granted relying on two
discretizations: (i) a cell-centered finite volume (FV) scheme for the
nonlinear convective contribution on the polygonal cells; (ii) a staggered
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for the solution of the linear system
associated to the implicit discretization of the pressure sub-system.
Therefore, three different meshes are used, namely a polygonal Voronoi mesh, a
triangular subgrid and a staggered quadrilateral subgrid. The novel schemes are
proved to be Asymptotic Preserving (AP), hence a consistent discretization of
the limit model is retrieved for vanishing Froude numbers, which is the given
by the so-called ""lake at rest"" equations. Furthermore, the novel methods are
well-balanced by construction, and this property is also demonstrated. Accuracy
and robustness are then validated against a set of benchmark test cases with
Froude numbers ranging in the interval $\Fr \approx [10^{-6};5]$, hence showing
that multiple time scales can be handled by the novel methods.

a knowledge distillation regularization term for retaining the performance on

prolate as well as the system density, we observe different responses that are
quantified by measuring the effective friction perceived by the probe particle.
The resulting friction coefficient exhibits a linear regime at forces that are
much weaker and larger than the thermal forces, whereas a non-linear,
force-thinning regime is observed at intermediate force intensities.

harmonization module (which AccoMontage does not have). This module generates
structured and coherent full-length chord progression by optimizing and
balancing three loss terms: a micro-level loss for note-wise dissonance, a
meso-level loss for phrase-template matching, and a macro-level loss for full
piece coherency. Second, we develop a graphical user interface which allows
users to select different styles of chord progression and piano texture.
Currently, chord progression styles include Pop, R&B, and Dark, while piano
texture styles include several levels of voicing density and rhythmic
complexity. Experimental results show that both our harmonization and
arrangement results significantly outperform the baselines. Lastly, we release
AccoMontage2 as an online application as well as the organized chord

Since people live in real-world senses, gait recognition in the wild is a more
practical problem that has recently attracted the attention of the community of
multimedia and computer vision. Current methods that obtain state-of-the-art
performance on in-the-lab benchmarks achieve much worse accuracy on the
recently proposed in-the-wild datasets because these methods can hardly model
the varied temporal dynamics of gait sequences in unconstrained scenes.
Therefore, this paper presents a novel multi-hop temporal switch method to
achieve effective temporal modeling of gait patterns in real-world scenes.
Concretely, we design a novel gait recognition network, named Multi-hop
Temporal Switch Network (MTSGait), to learn spatial features and multi-scale
temporal features simultaneously. Different from existing methods that use 3D
convolutions for temporal modeling, our MTSGait models the temporal dynamics of
gait sequences by 2D convolutions. By this means, it achieves high efficiency
with fewer model parameters and reduces the difficulty in optimization compared
with 3D convolution-based models. Based on the specific design of the 2D
convolution kernels, our method can eliminate the misalignment of features
among adjacent frames. In addition, a new sampling strategy, i.e., non-cyclic
continuous sampling, is proposed to make the model learn more robust temporal
features. Finally, the proposed method achieves superior performance on two
public gait in-the-wild datasets, i.e., GREW and Gait3D, compared with
state-of-the-art methods.

them notoriously difficult to test, including a complex input space, long

This paper introduces the Causal Testing Framework: a framework that uses
Causal Inference techniques to establish causal effects from existing data,
enabling users to conduct software testing activities concerning the effect of
a change, such as Metamorphic Testing and Sensitivity Analysis, a posteriori.
We present three case studies covering real-world scientific models,

momentum transport of the system. We first study the size distribution and the
breakup mechanism of the dispersed droplets for turbulent emulsions with a low
volume-fraction (dilute) of the dispersed phase. For systems with a high

catastrophic phase inversions, which can happen when the volume fraction of the

  We build an efficient federated learning algorithm by exploiting these

sufficiently large and clients are less (Hessian-)~heterogeneous, the algorithm
requires fewer communication rounds then existing methods such as FedAvg,

starburst activity; (2) The dynamically inferred SMBH mass is 1.6 +/- 0.4 (rnd)

compact space, time and spectral embeddings of both tensor fields (P-SCT) and
general tensors (P-SCT-Permute). All subsequent information querying with high
accuracy is performed on the generative sketches. We produce optimal rank-r

efficient policy is learned via an adaptable stochastic Thompson sampling using

This new calculation requires the computation of multipolar moments of higher

spacetime cannot be extended to the past beyond some boundary \mathcal{B}.
Therefore, the inflationary universe must have had some kind of beginning.
However, the BGW theorem says nothing about the boundary conditions on
\mathcal{B}, or even about its location. Here we present a single-scalar field
model of the Two-Measure Theory, where the non-Riemannian volume element
$\Upsilon d^4x$ is present in the action. As a result of the model dynamics, an
upper bound \varphi_0 of admissible values of the scalar field \varphi appears,
which sets the position of \mathcal{B} in the form of a spacelike hypersurface
\Upsilon(x)=0 with a boundary condition: \Upsilon\to 0^+ as
\varphi\to\varphi_0^-. A detailed study has established that if the initial
kinetic energy density \rho_{kin}^{(in)} prevails over initial gradient energy
density \rho_{grad}^{(in)} then there is an interval of initial values
\varphi_{in}^{(min)}\leq\varphi_{in}<\varphi_0, where \rho_{kin}^{(in)} and
\rho_{grad}^{(in)} cannot exceed the potential energy density and hence the
initial conditions necessary for the onset of inflation are satisfied. It is
shown that under almost all possible left-handed boundary conditions on
\mathcal{B}, that is where \Upsilon\to 0^-, the metric tensor in the Einstein
frame has a jump discontinuity on \mathcal{B}, so the Christoffel connection
coefficients are not defined on the spacelike hypersurface \Upsilon=0. Thus, if
\varphi_{in}^{(min)}\leq \varphi_{in}<\varphi_0 and
\rho_{kin}^{(in)}>\rho_{grad}^{(in)}, then there was an inflationary stage in
the history of our Universe and the congruence of timelike geodesics cannot be
extended to the past beyond the hypersurface \Upsilon=0.

to the large number of accessible states, determination of the necessary

impractical. Here, a machine-learned (ML) model based on translational energy
and product vibrational states assigned from a spectroscopic, ro-vibrational
coupled energy expression based on the Dunham expansion is developed and tested
quantitatively. All models considered in this work reproduce final state
distributions determined from quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) simulations with
$R^2 \sim 0.98$. As a further validation, thermal rates determined from the
machine-learned models agree with those from explicit QCT simulations and
demonstrate that the atomistic details are retained by the machine learning
which makes them suitable for applications in more coarse-grained simulations.
More generally, it is found that ML is suitable for designing robust and
accurate models from mixed computational/experimental data which may also be of

numerous brain areas so that the respiratory rhythm could be considered as a
master clock promoting communication between distant brain areas. However,
outside of the olfactory system it is not known if respiration-related
oscillation (RRo) could exist in the membrane potential (MP) of neurons neither
if it can structure spiking discharge. To fill this gap, we co-recorded MP and
LFP activities in different non-olfactory brain areas: median prefrontal cortex
(mPFC), primary somatosensory cortex (S1), primary visual cortex (V1), and
hippocampus (HPC), in urethane-anesthetized rats. Using respiratory cycle by
respiratory cycle analysis, we observed that respiration could modulate both MP
and spiking discharges in all recorded areas. Further quantifications revealed
RRo episodes were transient in most neurons (5 consecutive cycles in average).
RRo development in MP was largely influenced by the presence of respiratory
modulation in the LFP. Finally, moderate hyperpolarization reduced RRo
occurence within cells of mpFC and S1. By showing the respiratory rhythm
influenced brain activity deep to the MP of non-olfactory neurons, our data
support the idea respiratory rhythm could mediate long-range communication.

  Limits and System Design",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In order to meet the demands of future innovative applications, many efforts
have been made to exceed the limits predicted by Shannon's Theory. Besides the
investigation of beyond-Shannon metrics such as security, latency, and
semantics, another direction is to jointly design the transceiver and the
environment by utilizing the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). In this
paper, we consider the analysis and design of IRS-aided multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) secure communications, which has attracted much research
attention but still in its infancy. For example, despite their importance, the
fundamental limits of IRS-aided wiretap MIMO communications are not yet
available in the literature. In this paper, we will investigate these
fundamental limits by determining the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and secrecy
outage probability (SOP). For that purpose, the central limit theorem (CLT) for
the joint distributions of the mutual information (MI) statistics over the
IRS-aided MIMO secure communication channel is derived by utilizing the random
matrix theory (RMT). The derived CLT is then used to obtain the closed form
expressions for the ESR and SOP, which are also extended to the scenario with
multiple multi-antenna eavesdroppers. Based on the theoretical results,
algorithms for maximizing the artificial noise (AN) aided ESR and minimizing
the SOP are proposed. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the
theoretical results and effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithms.

Libraries (TPLs), Maven adopts Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to standardize the
underlying meaning of versions, but users could still confront abnormal
execution and crash after upgrades even if compilation and linkage succeed. It
is caused by semantic breaking (SemB) issues, such that APIs directly used by
users have identical signatures but inconsistent semantics across upgrades. To
strengthen compliance with SemVer rules, developers and users should be alerted
of such issues. Unfortunately, it is challenging to detect them statically,
because semantic changes in the internal methods of APIs are difficult to
capture. Dynamic testing can confirmingly uncover some, but it is limited by
inadequate coverage.
  To detect SemB issues over compatible upgrades (Patch and Minor) by SemVer
rules, we conduct an empirical study on 180 SemB issues to understand the root
causes, inspired by which, we propose Sembid (Semantic Breaking Issue Detector)
to statically detect such issues of TPLs for developers and users. Since APIs
are directly used by users, Sembid detects and reports SemB issues based on
APIs. For a pair of APIs, Sembid walks through the call chains originating from
the API to locate breaking changes by measuring semantic diff. Then, Sembid
checks if the breaking changes can affect API's output along call chains. The
evaluation showed Sembid achieved 90.26% recall and 81.29% precision and
outperformed other API checkers on SemB API detection. We also revealed Sembid
detected over 3 times more SemB APIs with better coverage than unit tests, the
commonly used solution. Furthermore, we carried out an empirical study on
1,629,589 APIs from 546 version pairs of top Java libraries and found there
were 2-4 times more SemB APIs than those with signature-based issues.

changes of state can be disfavored for specific magic numbers. A transition
that has no counterpart in the macroscopic world is orientational melting, in
which localized particles with long-range repulsive interactions forming a
two-dimensional crystal become delocalized in common circular or elliptical

simulations and witnessed in a few pioneering experiments. However, a detailed
experimental investigation fully revealing its non-universal nature has been
missing so far. Here we report the observation of orientational melting in a

We quantitatively characterize orientational melting, and compare the results

the resource constraints are not adaptively updated during dual optimization,
which underscores the critical role of adaptive dual variable update.

attention from both academia and industry due to its wide applications like
automatic driving, robotics, and so on. However, current methods for point
cloud action recognition usually require a huge amount of data with manual
annotations and a complex backbone network with high computation costs, which
makes it impractical for real-world applications. Therefore, this paper
considers the task of semi-supervised point cloud action recognition. We
propose a Masked Pseudo-Labeling autoEncoder (\textbf{MAPLE}) framework to
learn effective representations with much fewer annotations for point cloud
action recognition. In particular, we design a novel and efficient
\textbf{De}coupled \textbf{s}patial-\textbf{t}emporal Trans\textbf{Former}
(\textbf{DestFormer}) as the backbone of MAPLE. In DestFormer, the spatial and
temporal dimensions of the 4D point cloud videos are decoupled to achieve
efficient self-attention for learning both long-term and short-term features.
Moreover, to learn discriminative features from fewer annotations, we design a
masked pseudo-labeling autoencoder structure to guide the DestFormer to
reconstruct features of masked frames from the available frames. More
importantly, for unlabeled data, we exploit the pseudo-labels from the
classification head as the supervision signal for the reconstruction of
features from the masked frames. Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that MAPLE achieves superior results on three public benchmarks and outperforms
the state-of-the-art method by 8.08\% accuracy on the MSR-Action3D dataset.

emulating numerous neuronal dynamics, including tonic spiking, stochastic
spiking, leaky-integrate-and-fire features, spike latency, temporal
integration. The device also exhibits phasic bursting, a property that has
scarcely been observed and studied in solid-state nano-neurons. We show that we
can reproduce and understand this particular response through simulations using
non-linear dynamics. These results show that a single NbOx device is sufficient
to emulate a collection of rich neuronal dynamics that paves a path forward for
realizing scalable and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing paradigms.

still been little explored in human-robot interaction. In this work,
participants were asked to approach and touch a humanoid robot on the hand (Nao
- 26 participants; Pepper - 28 participants) to get its attention. We designed
reaction behaviors for the robot that consisted in four different combinations
of arm movements with the touched hand moving forward or back and the other
hand moving forward or staying in place, with simultaneous leaning back,
followed by looking at the participant. We studied which reaction of the robot
people found the most appropriate and what was the reason for their choice. For
both robots, the preferred reaction of the robot hand being touched was moving
back. For the other hand, no movement at all was rated most natural for the
Pepper, while it was movement forward for the Nao. A correlation between the
anxiety subscale of the participants' personality traits and the passive to
active/aggressive nature of the robot reactions was found. Most participants
noticed the leaning back and rated it positively. Looking at the participant
was commented on positively by some participants in unstructured comments. We
also analyzed where and how participants spontaneously touched the robot on the
hand. In summary, the touch reaction behaviors designed here are good
candidates to be deployed more generally in social robots, possibly including
incidental touch in crowded environments. The robot size constitutes one
important factor shaping how the robot reaction is perceived.

minimize the mission completion time. The formulated problem is NP-hard due to
the need of visiting the information collection locations for all targets;
moreover, the UAV's trajectories over different time durations are coupled in
non-convex constraints for ensuring information transmission completion. To
handle this difficult problem, we first propose a structured communication

appropriately changing visual feedback to body movements. Because tendon
vibration can affect our somatosensory perception, we propose a method for
leveraging tendon vibration to extend pseudo-haptics. To evaluate the proposed
method, we conducted three experiments that investigate the effect of tendon
vibration on the range and resolution of pseudo-haptic sensation. The first
experiment evaluated the effect of tendon vibration on the detection threshold
(DT) of visual/physical motion discrepancy. The results show that vibrations on
the inner tendons of the wrist and elbow increased the DT. This indicates that
tendon vibration can increase applicable visual motion gain without being
noticed by users. The second experiment investigated the effect of tendon
vibration on the resolution, that is, the just noticeable difference (JND) of
pseudo-weight sensation. The results indicate that both with- and
without-vibration conditions had a similar JND of pseudo-weight sensation and
thus, both conditions can be considered to have a similar resolution of sense
of weight. The third experiment investigated the equivalence between the weight
sensation induced by tendon vibration and visual motion gain, that is, the
point of subjective equality (PSE). The results show that vibration increases
the sense of weight, and its effect was the same as that using a gain of 0.64
without vibration. Taken together, our results suggest that using tendon
vibration can enable a significantly wider (nearly double) range of
pseudo-haptic sensation, without impairing its resolution.

from both the academia and industry. The ever-growing number of UAV brings
challenges for air traffic control (ATC), and thus trajectory prediction plays
a vital role in ATC, especially for avoiding collisions among UAVs. However,
the dynamic flight of UAV aggravates the complexity of trajectory prediction.
Different with civil aviation aircrafts, the most intractable difficulty for
UAV trajectory prediction depends on acquiring effective location information.
Fortunately, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) is an
effective technique to help obtain positioning information. It is widely used
in the civil aviation aircraft, due to its high data update frequency and low
cost of corresponding ground stations construction. Hence, in this work, we
consider leveraging ADS-B to help UAV trajectory prediction. However, with the
ADS-B information for a UAV, it still lacks efficient mechanism to predict the
UAV trajectory. It is noted that the recurrent neural network (RNN) is
available for the UAV trajectory prediction, in which the long short-term
memory (LSTM) is specialized in dealing with the time-series data. As above, in
this work, we design a system of UAV trajectory prediction with the ADS-B
information, and propose the recurrent LSTM (RLSTM) based algorithm to achieve
the accurate prediction. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted by Python
to evaluate the proposed algorithms, and the results show that the average
trajectory prediction error is satisfied, which is in line with expectations.

is still mysterious. We explore the possibility that dark energy fluctuates,
resulting in spatial correlations. Due to these fluctuations, the Hubble rate
itself becomes a fluctuating quantity. We discuss the effect this has on
measurements of type Ia supernovae, which are used to constrain the luminosity
distance. We show that the luminosity distance is affected by spatial
correlations in several ways. First, the luminosity distance becomes dressed by
the fluctuations, thereby differing from standard $\Lambda$CDM. Second, angular
correlations become visible in the two-point correlation function of the
luminosity distance. To investigate the latter we construct the angular power
spectrum of luminosity distance fluctuations. We then perform a forecast for
two supernova surveys, the ongoing Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the upcoming
Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and compare this effect with
relativistic lensing effects from perturbed $\Lambda$CDM. We find that the
signal can rise above the lensing effects and that LSST could test this effect
for a large part of the parameter space. As an example, a specific realisation
of such a scenario is that quantum fluctuations of some field in the early
universe imprint spatial correlations with a predictable form in the dark
energy density today. In this case, the Hubble rate fluctuates due to the
intrinsic quantum nature of the dark energy density field. We study whether the
signal of this specific model would be measurable, and conclude that testing
this model with LSST would be challenging. However, taking into account a speed
of sound $c_s<1$ of the dark energy fluid can make this model observable.

undertakes a comparative analysis of the aperiodic electron firehose

counter-beaming populations. Two symmetric counter-beams provide an effective
kinetic anisotropy similar to the temperature anisotropy of a single
(non-drifting) population, with temperature along the magnetic field direction
larger than that in perpendicular direction. Therefore, the counter-beaming
plasma is susceptible to firehose-like instabilities (FIs), parallel and
oblique branches. Here we focus on the oblique beaming FI, which is also
aperiodic when the free energy is provided by symmetric counter-beams. Our
results show that, for relative small drifts or beaming speeds ($U$), not
exceeding the thermal speed ($\alpha$), the aperiodic FIs exist in the same
interval of wave-numbers and the same range of oblique angles (with respect to
the magnetic field direction), but the growth rates of counter-beaming FI

$U/\alpha > 1$, however, another electrostatic two-stream instability (ETSI) is
also predicted, which may have growth rates higher than those of CBFI, and may

for any $x\in G/H$ and any nonzero $y\in T_x(G/H)$, there exists a Riemannian
equigeodesic $c(t)$ with $c(0)=x$ and $\dot{c}(0)=y$. These two notions can be
naturally transferred to the Finsler setting, which provides the definitions
for Finsler equigeodesic and Finsler equigeodesic space. We prove two
classification theorems for Riemannian equigeodesic spaces and Finsler
equigeodesic spaces respectively. Firstly, a homogeneous manifold $G/H$ with
connected simply connected quasi compact $G$ and connected $H$ is Riemannian
equigeodesic if and only if it can be decomposed as a product of Euclidean
factors and compact strongly isotropy irreducible factors. Secondly, a
homogeneous manifold $G/H$ with a compact semi simple $G$ is Finsler
equigeodesic if and only if it can be locally decomposed as a product, in which
each factor is $Spin(7)/G_2$, $G_2/SU(3)$ or a symmetric space of compact type.
These results imply that symmetric space and strongly isotropy irreducible
space of compact type can be interpreted by equigeodesic properties. As an
application, we classify the homogeneous manifold $G/H$ with a compact semi
simple $G$, such that all $G$-invariant Finsler metrics on $G/H$ are Berwald.
It suggests a new project in homogeneous Finsler geometry, to systematically
study the homogeneous manifold $G/H$ on which all $G$-invariant Finsler metrics

suffer from uncertainties due to the limited performance of sensors, even
unknown environmental disturbances, or humans. In this work, we quantify these
measurement uncertainties by making use of conservation measures which are
quantitative, system specific properties that are constant over time, space, or
other state space dimensions. The key idea of our method lies in the immediate
data evaluation of incoming data during run-time referring to conservation
equations. In particular, we estimate violations of a-priori known, domain
specific conservation properties and consider them as the consequence of
measurement uncertainties. We validate our method on a use case in the context
of human-robot collaboration, thereby highlighting the importance of our

three methods for negation detection in Dutch clinical notes. We used the
Erasmus Medical Center Dutch Clinical Corpus to compare a rule-based method
based on ContextD, a biLSTM model using MedCAT and (finetuned) RoBERTa-based
models. We found that both the biLSTM and RoBERTa models consistently
outperform the rule-based model in terms of F1 score, precision and recall. In
addition, we systematically categorized the classification errors for each

ultimately all three approaches can be viable depending on the use case at

Specifically, our data analysis unveils that user movement exhibits noticeable

generate obvious artifacts due to the dramatic differences in poses, scales,
and shifts between the source person and the driving person. To overcome these
challenges, this paper presents a novel REgionto-whole human MOtion Transfer
(REMOT) framework based on GANs. To generate realistic motions, the REMOT
adopts a progressive generation paradigm: it first generates each body part in
the driving pose without flow-based warping, then composites all parts into a
complete person of the driving motion. Moreover, to preserve the natural global
appearance, we design a Global Alignment Module to align the scale and position
of the source person with those of the driving person based on their layouts.
Furthermore, we propose a Texture Alignment Module to keep each part of the
person aligned according to the similarity of the texture. Finally, through
extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, our REMOT achieves

of an extended main-sequence turn off -- like in Magellanic clusters younger

is expected from the photometric errors, at magnitudes well below the region of
the extended turn off, where neither age differences nor rotation rates (the
candidates to explain the extended turn off phenomenon) are expected to play a
role. Moreover, not even the contribution of unresolved binaries can fully
explain the observed broadening. We investigated the reasons behind this
broadening by making use of synthetic stellar populations and differential
colour-colour diagrams using a combination of Gaia and Sloan filters. From our
analysis we have concluded that the observed colour spread in the Gaia
colour-magnitude diagram can be reproduced by a combination of either a
metallicity spread Delta[Fe/H] ~ 0.15 plus a differential reddening across the
face of the cluster spanning a total range DeltaE (B - V) ~ 0.06, or a spread
of the initial helium mass fraction DeltaY ~ 0.10 plus a smaller range of
reddening DeltaE (B - V) ~ 0.03. High-resolution differential abundance
determinations of a sizeable sample of cluster stars are necessary to confirm
or exclude the presence of a metal abundance spread. Our results raise the
possibility that also individual open clusters, like globular clusters and
massive star clusters, host stars born with different initial chemical
compositions.

5G, and the conventional multi-user linear precoding approach used in
space-division multiple access (SDMA), multi-user and massive MIMO in 4G and

and beyond should be intimately related to the fundamental problem of
interference management. We start from foundational principles of interference
management and rate-splitting, and progressively delineate RSMA frameworks for
downlink, uplink, and multi-cell networks. We show that, in contrast to past
generations of multiple access techniques (OMA, NOMA, SDMA), RSMA offers
numerous benefits. We then discuss how those benefits translate into numerous
opportunities for RSMA in over forty different applications and scenarios of
6G. We finally address common myths and answer frequently asked questions,
opening the discussions to interesting future research avenues. Supported by
the numerous benefits and applications, the tutorial concludes on the

  Dielectric Properties of Vanadium Dioxide",,,,,"physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Bruggeman homogenization formalism was used to numerically investigate
the dielectric properties of a columnar thin film (CTF) made from vanadium
dioxide. For visible and near-infrared wavelengths, the CTF is
electromagnetically equivalent to a homogeneous orthorhombic material. Over the
58 deg C -- 72 deg C temperature range, the eigenvalues of the CTF's relative
permittivity dyadic are highly sensitive to temperature, and vary according to
whether the CTF is being heated or cooled. The anisotropy revealed through the
eigenvalues, and the anisotropy of the associated hysteresis, were investigated
in relation to temperature for CTFs of different porosities and columnar cross
sections. When the free-space wavelength is 800 nm, the CTF is a dissipative
dielectric material that exhibits temperature-dependent anisotropy and
anisotropic hysteresis. In contrast, when the free-space wavelength is 1550 nm,
the CTF can be either a dissipative dielectric material, a hyperbolic material
or a metal-like material, depending on the temperature and the porosity of the
CTF. As the porosity of the CTF decreases from 0.55 to 0.3, the anisotropy of
the CTF becomes more pronounced, as does the anisotropy of the hysteresis. Only
relatively modest variations in anisotropy and hysteresis arise in response to
varying the columnar cross-sectional shape, as compared to the variations
induced by varying the porosity.

overlap of a p$^+$ and an n$^+$ implants: the difference between acceptor and
donor doping will result in an effective concentration of about 5E16/cm$^3$,
similar to standard LGADs. At present, the gain mechanism of LGAD sensors under
irradiation is maintained up to a fluence of $\sim$ 1-2E15/cm$^2$, and then it
is lost due to the acceptor removal mechanism. The new design will be more
resilient to radiation, as both acceptor and donor atoms will undergo removal
with irradiation, but their difference will maintain constant. The compensated

embedding this system in a closed loop enables hybrid processing even if access

preparing quantum depolarizing channels as a novel quantum machine learning

single scenario may determine the objective value of a given solution.
Accordingly, it is a challenging task to reduce the size of an uncertainty set
without changing the resulting objective value too much. On the other hand,
robust optimization problems with many scenarios tend to be hard to solve, in
particular for two-stage problems. Hence, a reduced uncertainty set may be
central to find solutions in reasonable time. We propose scenario reduction
methods that give guarantees on the performance of the resulting robust
solution. Scenario reduction problems for one- and two-stage robust
optimization are framed as optimization problems that only depend on the
uncertainty set and not on the underlying decision making problem. Experimental
results indicate that objective values for the reduced uncertainty sets are
closely correlated to original objective values, resulting in better solutions

Riemann-Cartan concomitant. The theory predicts a total energy-momentum of the
system of space-time and matter to vanish, in line with the conjecture of a
""Zero-Energy-Universe"" going back to Lorentz (1916) and Levi-Civita (1917).
Consequently a flat geometry can only exist in presence of matter where the

integrate out the heavy degrees of freedom to construct the seesaw effective
field theory (SEFT). In this talk, we investigate the connection between the
full seesaw model and the low-energy SEFT from a brand-new perspective: the
invariant theory. Using the powerful tool of Hilbert series, we demonstrate the
intimate relation between the flavor space of the SEFT and that of its
ultraviolet theory. Through the matching of flavor invariants, it is revealed
that the precise measurements of dimension-five and dimension-six operators in
the SEFT at low energies are powerful enough to probe the full seesaw model,
including CP violation necessary for successful leptogenesis.

surfaces (STAR-RISs) is a promising passive device that contributes to a
full-space coverage via transmitting and reflecting the incident signal
simultaneously. As a new paradigm in wireless communications, how to analyze
the coverage and capacity performance of STAR-RISs becomes essential but
challenging. To solve the coverage and capacity optimization (CCO) problem in
STAR-RIS assisted networks, a multi-objective proximal policy optimization
(MO-PPO) algorithm is proposed to handle long-term benefits than conventional
optimization algorithms. To strike a balance between each objective, the MO-PPO
algorithm provides a set of optimal solutions to form a Pareto front (PF),
where any solution on the PF is regarded as an optimal result. Moreover, in
order to improve the performance of the MO-PPO algorithm, two update
strategies, i.e., action-value-based update strategy (AVUS) and loss
function-based update strategy (LFUS), are investigated. For the AVUS, the
improved point is to integrate the action values of both coverage and capacity
and then update the loss function. For the LFUS, the improved point is only to
assign dynamic weights for both loss functions of coverage and capacity, while
the weights are calculated by a min-norm solver at every update. The numerical
results demonstrated that the investigated update strategies outperform the
fixed weights MO optimization algorithms in different cases, which includes a
different number of sample grids, the number of STAR-RISs, the number of
elements in the STAR-RISs, and the size of STAR-RISs. Additionally, the
STAR-RIS assisted networks achieve better performance than conventional
wireless networks without STAR-RISs. Moreover, with the same bandwidth,
millimeter wave is able to provide higher capacity than sub-6 GHz, but at a
cost of smaller coverage.

incident to a vertex, for each vertex. The phase space $T(G)$ then consists of
all pairs $(v,e)$ where $v$ is a vertex and $e$ is an edge incident to $v$.
Such an initial condition gives a position and a momentum. The data $(v,e)$ is
of course equivalent to an edge endowed with an orientation $e_{\mathcal O}$.
With the polarization, each initial data leads to a leftward walk defined by
turning left at each vertex, or making a rebound if there is no other edge. A
leftward walk is called complete if it goes through all edges of $G$, not
necessarily in both directions. As usual, we define the valence of a vertex as
the number of edges incident to it. We say that a graph has valence at least
$V$ if the valence of each vertex is at least $V$. In this article, we prove
that if a graph is embedded in a closed oriented surface of genus $g$, of
valence at least $3g+3$, then this graph admits no complete leftward walk. For
genus $g =0,1$, we get sharp results. This leads to obstructions for the
embeddability of graphs on a surface. Since checking that a polarized graph
admits a complete leftward walk or not is done in time $4N$, where $N$ is the
cardinality of the edges (we just have to check it on both orientations of any

  Defect Detection",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Surface defect detection is one of the most essential processes for
industrial quality inspection. Deep learning-based surface defect detection
methods have shown great potential. However, the well-performed models usually
require large training data and can only detect defects that appeared in the
training stage. When facing incremental few-shot data, defect detection models
inevitably suffer from catastrophic forgetting and misclassification problem.
To solve these problems, this paper proposes a new knowledge distillation
network, called Dual Knowledge Align Network (DKAN). The proposed DKAN method
follows a pretraining-finetuning transfer learning paradigm and a knowledge
distillation framework is designed for fine-tuning. Specifically, an
Incremental RCNN is proposed to achieve decoupled stable feature representation
of different categories. Under this framework, a Feature Knowledge Align (FKA)
loss is designed between class-agnostic feature maps to deal with catastrophic
forgetting problems, and a Logit Knowledge Align (LKA) loss is deployed between
logit distributions to tackle misclassification problems. Experiments have been
conducted on the incremental Few-shot NEU-DET dataset and results show that
DKAN outperforms other methods on various few-shot scenes, up to 6.65% on the
mean Average Precision metric, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

teaching signals, thereby limiting its applicability in noisy physical systems.
Moreover, the algorithm requires separate temporal phases and has not been
applied to large-scale problems. Here we address these issues by extending EP
to holomorphic networks. We show analytically that this extension naturally
leads to exact gradients even for finite-amplitude teaching signals.
Importantly, the gradient can be computed as the first Fourier coefficient from
finite neuronal activity oscillations in continuous time without requiring
separate phases. Further, we demonstrate in numerical simulations that our
approach permits robust estimation of gradients in the presence of noise and
that deeper models benefit from the finite teaching signals. Finally, we
establish the first benchmark for EP on the ImageNet 32x32 dataset and show
that it matches the performance of an equivalent network trained with BP. Our

Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) allows agents to learn from transitions
sampled with non-uniform probability proportional to their temporal-difference
(TD) error. Although it has been shown that PER is one of the most crucial
components for the overall performance of deep RL methods in discrete action
domains, many empirical studies indicate that it considerably underperforms
actor-critic algorithms in continuous control. We theoretically show that actor
networks cannot be effectively trained with transitions that have large TD
errors. As a result, the approximate policy gradient computed under the
Q-network diverges from the actual gradient computed under the optimal
Q-function. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel experience replay sampling
framework for actor-critic methods, which also regards issues with stability
and recent findings behind the poor empirical performance of PER. The
introduced algorithm suggests a new branch of improvements to PER and schedules
effective and efficient training for both actor and critic networks. An
extensive set of experiments verifies our theoretical claims and demonstrates
that the introduced method significantly outperforms the competing approaches
and obtains state-of-the-art results over the standard off-policy actor-critic
algorithms.

requirements into the planning as well as the aerial robot's dynamics. In this

a moving mobile robot in a time-optimal manner. Rather than setting up the
approach trajectory manually, which makes it difficult to determine the optimal
total travel time to accomplish the desired task within dynamic limits, we
propose an optimization framework, which combines discrete mechanics and
complementarity constraints (DMCC) together. In the proposed framework, the
system dynamics is constrained with the discrete variational Lagrangian
mechanics that provides reliable estimation results also according to our
experiments. The handover opportunities are automatically determined and
arranged based on the desired complementarity constraints. Finally, the
performance of the proposed framework is verified with numerical simulations
and hardware experiments with our self-designed aerial manipulators.

symmetry breaking in metals has become a central issue in condensed matter
physics. We demonstrate the emergence of the nematic and smectic orders due to
orbital polarization ($n_{xz}\ne n_{yz}$) and the symmetry breaking in the
correlated intersite hopping (= bond order $\delta t_{i,j}$) in Fe-based and
cuprate superconductors. In addition, we discuss exotic spontaneous loop
current orders driven by the pure imaginary $\delta t_{i,j}$. These interesting
``unconventional density-waves'' originate from the quantum interference
between different spin fluctuations that is described by the vertex correction
(VC) in the field theory. In the next stage, we discuss electron-correlation
driven superconductivity due to the fluctuations of unconventional
density-waves. For this purpose, we suggest the beyond-Migdal-Eliashberg gap
equation by including the VCs into the equation. In Fe-based superconductors,
high-$T_c$ $s$-wave superconductivity can be mediated by nematic and smectic
fluctuations because the pairing interaction is magnified by the VCs. We also
discuss the multipolar fluctuation pairing mechanism in heavy fermion systems,
owing to the cooperation between the strong spin-orbit interaction and the
strong electron correlation. To summarize, we suggest that the quantum

gene-environment interactions (synG$\times$E). Varying multi-index coefficients
models (VMICM) have been a promising tool to model synergistic G$\times$E
effect and to understand how multiple Es jointly influence genetic risks on a

approaches that alternately evolve and compress solutions and (ii) strict DLRA
approaches that augment the low-rank manifold using subspaces generated locally
in time by the DLRA integrator. The strategy is based on an analysis of the
error between a forward temporal update into the ambient full-rank space, which
is typically computed in a step-truncation approach before re-compressing, and
the standard DLRA update, which is forced to live in a low-rank manifold. We
use this error, without requiring its full-rank representation, to correct the
DLRA solution. A key ingredient for maintaining a low-rank representation of
the error is a randomized singular value decomposition (SVD), which introduces
some degree of stochastic variability into the implementation. The strategy is
formulated and implemented in the context of discontinuous Galerkin spatial
discretizations of partial differential equations and applied to several

Numerical experiments comparing the predictor-corrector strategy to other
methods demonstrate robustness to overcome short-comings of step truncation or

observation, and is used in various tasks such as forest fire monitoring and
ocean monitoring. Image object detection technology, despite the significant
developments, is struggling to handle remote sensor images and small-scale
objects, due to the limited pixels of small objects. Numerous existing studies
have demonstrated that an effective way to promote small object detection is to
introduce the spatial context. Meanwhile, recent researches for image
classification have shown that spectral convolution operations can perceive
long-term spatial dependence more efficiently in the frequency domain than
spatial domain. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Frequency-aware
Feature Pyramid Framework (FFPF) for remote sensing object detection, which
consists of a novel Frequency-aware ResNet (F-ResNet) and a Bilateral
Spectral-aware Feature Pyramid Network (BS-FPN). Specifically, the F-ResNet is
proposed to perceive the spectral context information by plugging the frequency
domain convolution into each stage of the backbone, extracting richer features
of small objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
introduce frequency-domain convolution into remote sensing object detection
task. In addition, the BSFPN is designed to use a bilateral sampling strategy
and skipping connection to better model the association of object features at
different scales, towards unleashing the potential of the spectral context
information from F-ResNet. Extensive experiments are conducted for object
detection in the optical remote sensing image dataset (DIOR and DOTA). The

inner size coincides with the sublimation radius, is devoid of small,
submicrometer-sized dust grains. The inner edge of the outer disk features a
puffed-up rim, typically seen in intermediate-mass stars. Grain growth,

is variable at mid-infrared wavelengths on both daily and annual timescales,

the performance of deep learning models. In recent years, lots of work pays
attention to domain generalization (DG) where distribution shift exists and
target data are unseen. Despite the progress in algorithm design, two
foundational factors have long been ignored: 1) the optimization for
regularization-based objectives (e.g., distribution alignment), and 2) the
model selection for DG since no knowledge about the target domain can be
utilized. In this paper, we propose Mixup guided optimization and selection
techniques for domain generalization. For optimization, we utilize an adapted
Mixup to generate an out-of-distribution dataset that can guide the preference
direction and optimize with Pareto optimization. For model selection, we
generate a validation dataset with a closer distance to the target
distribution, and thereby it can better represent the target data. We also
present some theoretical insights behind our proposals. Comprehensive
experiments on one visual classification benchmark and three time-series

time series (MTS) changes over time, which is known as distribution drift. Most
existing MTS forecasting models greatly suffer from distribution drift and
degrade the forecasting performance over time. Existing methods address
distribution drift via adapting to the latest arrived data or self-correcting
per the meta knowledge derived from future data. Despite their great success in
MTS forecasting, these methods hardly capture the intrinsic distribution
changes, especially from a distributional perspective. Accordingly, we propose
a novel framework temporal conditional variational autoencoder (TCVAE) to model
the dynamic distributional dependencies over time between historical
observations and future data in MTSs and infer the dependencies as a temporal
conditional distribution to leverage latent variables. Specifically, a novel
temporal Hawkes attention mechanism represents temporal factors subsequently
fed into feed-forward networks to estimate the prior Gaussian distribution of
latent variables. The representation of temporal factors further dynamically
adjusts the structures of Transformer-based encoder and decoder to distribution
changes by leveraging a gated attention mechanism. Moreover, we introduce
conditional continuous normalization flow to transform the prior Gaussian to a
complex and form-free distribution to facilitate flexible inference of the
temporal conditional distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on six
real-world MTS datasets demonstrate the TCVAE's superior robustness and
effectiveness over the state-of-the-art MTS forecasting baselines. We further
illustrate the TCVAE applicability through multifaceted case studies and

of the distance from a galactic center. The second type of vacuum polarization
has a more complicated equation of state. As a static physical effect, it
produces renormalization of the gravitational constant, thus, causing no static
halo. However, a nonstationary polarization of the second type, resulting from
an exponential increase (or decrease) of the galactic nuclei mass with time in
some hypothetical time-dependent process, produces a gravitational potential

However, this physical model has shortcomings in accuracy and adaptability,

demonstrate which and how individual elements of the multi-agent learning

one-period memory as a testbed. Each of the two learning agents learns a
strategy that conditions the following action choices on both agents' action
choices of the last round. We find that next to a high caring for future
rewards, a low exploration rate, and a small learning rate, it is primarily
intrinsic stochastic fluctuations of the reinforcement learning process which
double the final rate of cooperation to up to 80%. Thus, inherent noise is not
a necessary evil of the iterative learning process. It is a critical asset for
the learning of cooperation. However, we also point out the trade-off between a

to incorporate the description of measurement processes into the mathematical
structure of quantum theory. Typically, these proposals introduce new physical
constants, and imply small violations of momentum and energy conservation.
  These problematic features can be eliminated by assuming that wave function
collapse is induced by the individual interactions that establish correlations
between systems. The generation of a sufficient number of small, random shifts
of amplitude between interacting and noninteracting branches of the wave
function can bring about collapse on a scale consistent with our macroscopic
experience. Two-particle interaction potential energies can be used as the
basis for a collapse term added to the Schr\""{o}dinger equation. The range of
the interactions sets the distance scale of the collapse effects; the ratio of
potential energies to the total relativistic energies of the particles
determines the magnitude of the amplitude shifts, and the rate at which the
interactions proceed fixes the timing parameters.
  Consistency with conservation laws in individual experiments is maintained
because the collapse operator automatically takes into account the small,
residual entanglement between the measured system and systems with which it has
previously exchanged conserved quantities during interactions. Conservation is
exact for momentum and orbital angular momentum, and it holds for energy within
the accuracy allowed by the limited forms of energy describable in
nonrelativistic theory.

hyperparameter optimization in machine learning and optimization in design of
experiments. Ising machines are useful for binary optimization problems because
variables can be represented by a single binary variable of Ising machines.
However, conventional approaches using an Ising machine cannot handle black-box
optimization problems with non-binary values. To overcome this limitation, we
propose an approach for integer-variable black-box optimization problems by
using Ising/annealing machines and factorization machines in cooperation with
three different integer-encoding methods. The performance of our approach is
numerically evaluated with different encoding methods using a simple problem of
calculating the energy of the hydrogen molecule in the most stable state. The
proposed approach can calculate the energy using any of the integer-encoding
methods. However, one-hot encoding is useful for problems with a small size.

it as complexity factor for the considered distribution. Two evolutionary modes
are discussed to study the dynamics of cylinder. We then take the homologous

orchards, and infrastructure. Also, it helps to estimate and reduce consequent
losses for businesses and, particularly, insurance companies. But hail
forecasting is challenging. Data used for designing models for this purpose are
tree-dimensional geospatial time series. Hail is a very local event with
respect to the resolution of available datasets. Also, hail events are rare -
only 1% of targets in observations are marked as ""hail"". Models for nowcasting
and short-term hail forecasts are improving. Introducing machine learning
models to the meteorology field is not new. There are also various climate
models reflecting possible scenarios of climate change in the future. But there
are no machine learning models for data-driven forecasting of changes in hail
frequency for a given area.
  The first possible approach for the latter task is to ignore spatial and
temporal structure and develop a model capable of classifying a given vertical
profile of meteorological variables as favorable to hail formation or not.
Although such an approach certainly neglects important information, it is very
light weighted and easily scalable because it treats observations as
independent from each other. The more advanced approach is to design a neural
network capable to process geospatial data. Our idea here is to combine
convolutional layers responsible for the processing of spatial data with
recurrent neural network blocks capable to work with temporal structure.
  This study compares two approaches and introduces a model suitable for the

deterministic linear solvers with a fixed-seed Quasi-Monte Carlo calculation to
obtain more accurate and efficient solutions to the neutron transport equation
(NTE). Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) is the use of low-discrepancy sequences to
sample the phase space in place of pseudo-random number generators used by
traditional Monte Carlo (MC). QMC techniques decrease the variance in the
stochastic transport sweep and therefore increase the accuracy of the iterative
method. Historically, QMC has largely been ignored by the particle transport
community because it breaks the Markovian assumption needed to model scattering
in analog MC particle simulations. However, by using iterative methods the NTE
can be modeled as a pure-absorption problem. This removes the need to
explicitly model particle scattering and provides an application well-suited
for QMC. To obtain solutions we experimented with three separate iterative
solvers: the standard Source Iteration (SI) and two linear Krylov Solvers,
GMRES and BiCGSTAB. The resulting hybrid iterative-QMC (iQMC) solver was
assessed on three one-dimensional slab geometry problems. In each sample
problem the Krylov Solvers achieve convergence with far fewer iterations (up to
8x) than the Source Iteration. Regardless of the linear solver used, the hybrid
method achieved an approximate convergence rate of $O(N^{-1})$, as compared to
the expected $O(N^{-1/2})$ of traditional MC simulation, across all test
problems.

dedicated seismometers to detect tremors. These smartphones have become
disposable items and are continuously ""upgraded"" and replaced. Yet every one of
these devices includes everything needed to act as a dedicated seismometer:
Wi-Fi capability, GPS, and an accelerometer. The software developed for this

  A large network of these seismic detection stations will effectively create
an affordable earthquake early-warning system that can be rapidly implemented

Solve time is the evaluation criteria for the computation efficiency. Results:
The results of the current study indicate a strong significant improvement in
the computation efficiency compared to the results of previous researches,
while maintaining the plan evaluation indicators in an ideal mode. Accordingly,
proposed method reduced the average of solving time by 45% in comparison to

  systems with shared standards","32 pages, 22 figures",,,,"physics.data-an cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The mutual incompatibility of distinct spectroscopic systems is among the
most limiting factors in Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS). The cost
related to setting up a new LIBS system is increased, as its extensive
calibration is required. Solving the problem would enable inter-laboratory
reference measurements and shared spectral libraries, which are fundamental for
other spectroscopic techniques. In this work, we study a simplified version of
this challenge where LIBS systems differ only in used spectrometers and
collection optics but share all other parts of the apparatus, and collect
spectra simultaneously from the same plasma plume. Extensive datasets measured
as hyperspectral images of heterogeneous specimens are used to train machine
learning models that can transfer spectra between systems. The transfer is
realized by a pipeline that consists of a variational autoencoder (VAE) and a
fully-connected artificial neural network (ANN). In the first step, we obtain a
latent representation of the spectra which were measured on the Primary system
(by using the VAE). In the second step, we map spectra from the Secondary
system to corresponding locations in the latent space (by the ANN). Finally,
Secondary system spectra are reconstructed from the latent space to the space
of the Primary system. The transfer is evaluated by several figures of merit
(Euclidean and cosine distances, both spatially resolved; k-means clustering of
transferred spectra). The methodology is compared to several baseline
approaches.

acoustic solutions, which are to date, crucially missing. This includes current
noise absorption methods, such as porous materials or acoustic resonators,
which are typically inefficient below 1 kHz, or fundamentally narrowband. Here,
we solve this vexing issue by introducing the concept of plasmacoustic
metalayers. We demonstrate that the dynamics of small layers of air plasma can
be controlled to interact with sound in an ultrabroadband way and over
deep-subwavelength distances. Exploiting the unique physics of plasmacoustic
metalayers, we experimentally demonstrate perfect sound absorption and tunable
acoustic reflection over more than two frequency decades, from several Hz to
the kHz range, with transparent plasma layers of thicknesses down to
$\lambda/1000$. Such unprecedented bandwidth and compactness opens new doors in
a variety of applications, including noise control, audio-engineering, room
acoustics, imaging and metamaterial design.

  Policies for Portfolio Optimization",,,"10.1145/3511808.3557363",,"q-fin.CP cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Portfolio management is a fundamental problem in finance. It involves
periodic reallocations of assets to maximize the expected returns within an
appropriate level of risk exposure. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been
considered a promising approach to solving this problem owing to its strong
capability in sequential decision making. However, due to the non-stationary
nature of financial markets, applying RL techniques to portfolio optimization
remains a challenging problem. Extracting trading knowledge from various expert
strategies could be helpful for agents to accommodate the changing markets. In
this paper, we propose MetaTrader, a novel two-stage RL-based approach for
portfolio management, which learns to integrate diverse trading policies to
adapt to various market conditions. In the first stage, MetaTrader incorporates
an imitation learning objective into the reinforcement learning framework.
Through imitating different expert demonstrations, MetaTrader acquires a set of
trading policies with great diversity. In the second stage, MetaTrader learns a
meta-policy to recognize the market conditions and decide on the most proper
learned policy to follow. We evaluate the proposed approach on three real-world
index datasets and compare it to state-of-the-art baselines. The empirical
results demonstrate that MetaTrader significantly outperforms those baselines
in balancing profits and risks. Furthermore, thorough ablation studies validate
the effectiveness of the components in the proposed approach.

for fabrication of a wide variety of materials, the latest trend at present is
to focus largely on 3D printing (3DP) of nanoceramics, which at present is
highly challenging, from both fundamental and industrial viewpoints inspite of
the tremendous versatility offered by these techniques in terms of addressing
design complexities. The two main reasons for the same are: low density and
poor mechanical properties of nanoceramic parts fabricated using 3DP
techniques. The fundamental reason behind the two aforementioned features of
3DP-fabricated nanoceramic parts is the huge extent of microstructural
inhomogeneity arising primarily due to variation in cooling rates during point
by point, line by line or layer by layer deposition methodology followed in 3DP
techniques, leading to a number of defects in the microstructure. Moreover, the
industrial application of nanoceramic parts manufactured using 3DP techniques,
is rather limited, primarily owing to the high manufacturing cost associated
with these nanoceramic parts. Although, in the last ten years, there has been a
considerable volume of work on 3DP-based techniques for manufacturing ceramic
parts with enhanced densities and improved mechanical properties, however,
there is limited understanding on the correlation of microstructure of
3DP-fabricated nanoceramic components with the mechanical properties. The
present review is aimed to review some of the most commonly used 3DP techniques
for the fabrication of nanoceramics and provide an overview of the future
perspectives, associated with the necessity towards developing a systematic
structure-property correlation through correlative characterisation methodology
in these materials.

  Thin Absorbers","15 pages, 13 figures",,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Dallenbach layer is composed of an absorbing magnetic-dielectric layer
attached to a perfect electric conductor (PEC) sheet. Under linearity and time
invariance (LTI) assumptions Rozanov has established analytically a sum-rule
trade-off between the absorption efficacy over a predefined bandwidth and the
thickness of the layer, that is the so called Rozanov bound. In recent years
several proposals have been introduced to bypass this bound by using non-LTI
absorbers. However, in practice, their implementation may be challenging. Here,
we introduce several new sum rules for LTI layer absorbers that are not covered
by the original Rozanov's criterion, and give rise to more relaxed constraints
on the absorption limit. We then, demonstrate practical LTI designs of
absorbing thin layers provide absorption beyond the Rozanov's bound. These are
based on the introduction of effective magnetic conductivity in the layer, or
the introduction of a penetrable impedance sheet that replaces the PEC in the
original Dallanbach layer.

of unity between two adjacent LSAs causes their boundary region to become
saturated with co-channel interference (CCI). Increasing the reuse factor will
reduce the CCI at the cost of degrading the spectral efficiency. This paper
addresses the frequency and transmit power planning which manages the CCI at
the LSA boundary to achieve a satisfactory trade-off between spectral
efficiency and broadcast coverage.
