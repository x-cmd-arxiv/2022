When clicking these
phishing URLs, the victim's private information is leaked to the attacker.
There have been proposed several machine learning methods to detect phishing
URLs. However, it still remains under-explored to detect phishing URLs with
evasion, i.e., phishing URLs that pretend to be benign by manipulating
patterns. In many cases, the attacker i) reuses prepared phishing web pages
because making a completely brand-new set costs non-trivial expenses, ii)
prefers hosting companies that do not require private information and are
cheaper than others, iii) prefers shared hosting for cost efficiency, and iv)
sometimes uses benign domains, IP addresses, and URL string patterns to evade
existing detection methods. Inspired by those behavioral characteristics, we
present a network-based inference method to accurately detect phishing URLs
camouflaged with legitimate patterns, i.e., robust to evasion. In the network
approach, a phishing URL will be still identified as phishy even after evasion
unless a majority of its neighbors in the network are evaded at the same time.
Our method consistently shows better detection performance throughout various
experimental tests than state-of-the-art methods, e.g., F-1 of 0.89 for our
method vs. 0.84 for the best feature-based method.

conventional predictive models unreliable. We address this shortcoming by
developing algorithms for data imputation and synthetic demand estimation for
future years without the actual ground truth data. We use 2017 Puget Sound
Regional Council (PSRC) and National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data and
impute from the NHTS for the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue MSA where delivery data is
relatively more frequent. Our imputation has the mean-squared error
$\mathsf{MSE} \approx 0.65$ to NHTS with mean $\approx 1$ and standard
deviation $\approx 3.5$ and provides a similarity matching between the two data
sources' samples. Given the unavailability of NHTS data for 2021, we use the
temporal fidelity of PSRC data sources (2017 and 2021) to project the
resolution onto the NHTS providing a synthetic estimate of NHTS deliveries.
Beyond the improved reliability of the estimates, we report explanatory
variables that were relevant in determining the volume of deliveries. This work
furthers existing methods in demand estimation for goods deliveries by

simulation models are adopted widely. In this paper, we first describe a simple
Markov model for the DAG-based blockchain with IOTA Tangle by means of two
layers of tips and internal tips' impatient connection behavior. Then we set up
a continuous-time Markov process to analyze the DAG-based blockchain system and
show that this Markov process is a level-dependent quasi-birth-and-death (QBD)
process. Based on this, we prove that the QBD process must be irreducible and
positive recurrent. Furthermore, once the stationary probability vector of the
QBD process is given, we provide performance analysis of the DAG-based
blockchain system. Next, we propose a new effective method for computing the
average confirmation time of any arriving internal tip at this system by means
of the first passage times and the PH distributions. Finally, we use numerical
examples to check the validity of our theoretical results and indicate how some
key system parameters influence the performance measures of this system.

Modularity is achieved by connecting multiple vehicles together to form a

simultaneously consider passenger and freight demand in the optimization
algorithm. The considered vehicles are specific for each demand type by can be
connected freely, hence it is possible to transport different demand types in
the same platoon. The cost terms in the problem formulation are comprised of
travel time costs, travel distance costs, fleet size costs, and cost
considering unserved requests. The modular vehicle operations are modeled in a
novel pickup and delivery problem which is solved using CPLEX and Adaptive
Large Neighborhood Search. In an extensive scenario study and case study in
Stockholm, the potentials of the new modular vehicle type are explored for
different spatial and temporal demand distributions. A parameter study on
vehicle capacity, vehicle range and cost saving assumptions is performed to
study their influence on the efficiency. The experiments carried out indicate a
general cost savings of 48% due to modularity and an additional 9% due to
consolidation. The reduction mainly stems from reduced operating costs and
reduced trip duration, while the same number of requests can be served in all
cases. Empty vehicle kilometers are reduced by more than 60% by consolidation
and modularity. The proposed model and optimization framework can be used by
companies and policy makers to identify required fleet sizes, optimal vehicle
routes and cost savings.

guarantees, which may lead to unnecessary accuracy loss when trying to achieve
meaningful privacy guarantees in time-varying databases. In this work, we
introduce \textit{age-dependent DP}, taking into account the underlying
stochastic nature of a time-varying database. In this new framework, we
establish a connection between classical DP and age-dependent DP, based on
which we characterize the impact of data staleness and temporal correlation on
privacy guarantees. Our characterization demonstrates that \textit{aging},
i.e., using stale data inputs and/or postponing the release of outputs, can be
a new strategy to protect data privacy in addition to noise injection in the
traditional DP framework. Furthermore, to generalize our results to a
multi-query scenario, we present a sequential composition result for
age-dependent DP under any publishing and aging policies. We then characterize
the optimal tradeoffs between privacy risk and utility and show how this can be
achieved. Finally, case studies show that to achieve a target of an arbitrarily
small privacy risk in a single-query case, combing aging and noise injection
only leads to a bounded accuracy loss, whereas using noise injection only (as
in the benchmark case of DP) will lead to an unbounded accuracy loss.

simplifies the learning in comparison to Lnn with ~25 times better performance

learning in the recent years since they alleviate the need for labeled
datasets, which are scarce and expensive to acquire. Contrastive methods are a
popular choice for self-supervision in the audio domain, and typically provide
a learning signal by forcing the model to be invariant to some transformations
of the input. These methods, however, require measures such as negative
sampling or some form of regularisation to be taken to prevent the model from
collapsing on trivial solutions. In this work, instead of invariance, we
propose to use equivariance as a self-supervision signal to learn audio tempo
representations from unlabelled data. We derive a simple loss function that
prevents the network from collapsing on a trivial solution during training,
without requiring any form of regularisation or negative sampling. Our
experiments show that it is possible to learn meaningful representations for
tempo estimation by solely relying on equivariant self-supervision, achieving
performance comparable with supervised methods on several benchmarks. As an
added benefit, our method only requires moderate compute resources and

from a generalized covariant Maxwell-like action. Starting from a rank-2
symmetric tensor field $A_{\mu\nu}(x)$, we build a partially symmetric rank-3
tensor field strength $F_{\mu\nu\rho}(x)$ which obeys a kind of Bianchi
identity. The most general action invariant under the covariant ``fracton''
transformation $\delta_{fract}A_{\mu\nu}(x)=\partial_\mu\partial_\nu\Lambda(x)$
consists of two independent terms: one describing Linearized Gravity (LG) and
the other referable to fractons. The whole action can be written in terms of
$F_{\mu\nu\rho}(x)$, and the fracton part of the invariant Lagrangian writes as
$F^2(x)$, in analogy with Maxwell theory. The canonical momentum derived from
the fracton Lagrangian coincides with the tensor electric field appearing in
the fracton Literature, and the field equations of motion, which have the same
form as the covariant Maxwell equations ($\partial^\mu
F_{\alpha\beta\mu}(x)=0$), can be written in terms of the generalized electric
and magnetic fields and yield two of the four Maxwell equations (generalized
electric Gauss and Amp\`ere laws), while the other two (generalized magnetic
Gauss and Faraday laws) are consequences of the ``Bianchi identity'' for the
tensor $F_{\mu\nu\rho}(x)$, as in Maxwell theory. In the covariant
generalization of the fracton theory, the equations describing the fracton
limited mobility, $i.e.$ the charge and dipole conservation, are not external
constraints, but rather consequences of the field equations of motion, hence of
the invariant action and, ultimately, of the fracton covariant symmetry.
Finally, we increase the known analogies between LG and fracton theory by
noting that both satisfy the generalized Gauss constraint which underlies the
limited mobility property, which one would not expect in LG.

competitive rivalry among participating players, protecting the privacy of

We propose a fully distributed equilibrium-computation approach for aggregative

existing differential-privacy solutions for aggregative games that have to
either sacrifice the accuracy of equilibrium computation to gain rigorous

hence losing privacy guarantees, as iteration proceeds. Our approach uses
independent noises across players, thus making it effective even when
adversaries have access to all shared messages as well as the underlying
algorithm structure. The encryption-free nature of the proposed approach, also
ensures efficiency in computation and communication. The approach is also
applicable in stochastic aggregative games, able to ensure both rigorous

pseudo-gradient mappings. Numerical comparisons with existing counterparts

understandable mathematical expressions, scientists and economists tend to use
partial differential equations (PDEs) to explain the highly nonlinear dynamics
of sequential patterns. However, it usually requires domain expert knowledge
and a series of simplified assumptions, which is not always practical and can
deviate from the ever-changing world. Is it possible to learn the differential
relations from data dynamically to explain the time-evolving dynamics? In this
work, we propose an learning framework that can automatically obtain
interpretable PDE models from sequential data. Particularly, this framework is
comprised of learnable differential blocks, named $P$-blocks, which is proved
to be able to approximate any time-evolving complex continuous functions in
theory. Moreover, to capture the dynamics shift, this framework introduces a
meta-learning controller to dynamically optimize the hyper-parameters of a
hybrid PDE model. Extensive experiments on times series forecasting of

the formula for the estimator includes 'forbidden knowledge' about training

particularly capable of explaining movements in the predictors that are
idiosyncratic to the training sample. An out-of-sample counterpart is
introduced to the popular 'leverage' measure of training observations'
importance. A new method is proposed to forecast out-of-sample fit at the time
of deployment, when the values for the predictors are known but the true
outcome variable is not. In Monte Carlo simulations and in an empirical
application using MRI brain scans, the proposed estimator performs comparably
to Predicted Residual Error Sum of Squares (PRESS) for the average

  arXiv:1805.04450",,,,"math.RA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the years questions have arisen about T-ideals of (noncommutative)
polynomials. But when evaluating a noncentral polynomial in subalgebras of
matrices, one often has little control in determining the specific evaluations
of the polynomial. One way of overcoming this difficulty in characteristic 0,
is to reduce to multilinear polynomials and utilizing the representation theory
of the symmetric group. But this technique is unavailable in characteristic
$p>0$.
  An alternative method, which succeeds, is the process of ``hiking'' a
polynomial, in which one specializes its indeterminates in several stages, to
obtain a polynomial that contains Capelli polynomials, in order to get control
on its evaluations. This method was utilized on homogeneous polynomials in the
proof of Specht's conjecture for affine algebras over fields of positive
characteristic. In this paper we develop hiking further to nonhomogeneous
polynomials, to apply to the representability question. Kemer proved in 1988
that every affine relatively free PI algebra over an infinite field, is
representable. In 2010, the first author of this paper proved more generally
that every affine relatively free PI algebra over any commutative Noetherian
unital ring is representable. We present a different, complete, proof, based on
hiking nonhomogeneous polynomials, over finite fields. We then obtain the full
result over a Noetherian commutative ring, using Noetherian induction on
T-ideals.
  The bulk of the proof is for the case of a base field of positive
characteristic. Here, whereas the usage of hiking is more direct than in
proving Specht's conjecture, one must consider nonhomogeneous polynomials when
the base ring is finite, which entails certain difficulties to be overcome.
  In the appendix we show how hiking can be adapted to prove the involutory
versions, as well as various graded and nonassociative theorems.

diminished and the electron occupation of the system and the transport current

SSVEP BCI spellers in the literature require an initial lengthy and tiring
user-specific training for each new user for system adaptation, including data
collection with EEG experiments, algorithm training and calibration (all are
before the actual use of the system). This impedes the widespread use of BCIs.
To ensure practicality, we propose a highly novel target identification method
based on an ensemble of deep neural networks (DNNs), which does not require any
sort of user-specific training. Method: We exploit already-existing literature
datasets from participants of previously conducted EEG experiments to train a
global target identifier DNN first, which is then fine-tuned to each
participant. We transfer this ensemble of fine-tuned DNNs to the new user
instance, determine the k most representative DNNs according to the
participants' statistical similarities to the new user, and predict the target
character through a weighted combination of the ensemble predictions. Results:
On two large-scale benchmark and BETA datasets, our method achieves impressive

conventionally measured as an average for an economy as a whole. While easy to
calculate from macroeconomic aggregates, such measures overlook possibly
relevant heterogeneity between payment systems, across regions, and intrinsic
to spending patterns. This paper proposes a new measurement methodology that
leverages large-scale micro-level transaction data and modern computational
techniques to measure the transfer velocity of money at the level of individual
spenders, enabling comparison between subgroups. Notably, our definition of
transfer velocity extends to payment systems where users are free to deposit
and withdraw, even as the total balance fluctuates. This is a common feature of
real-world payment systems that is not accounted for by previous approaches. We
estimate the transfer velocity of Sarafu, a digital community currency in
Kenya, using a newly available data set describing individual transactions over
a period of time that includes the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis reveals
distributional, temporal and geographical heterogeneity in spending patters.
Some units of Sarafu are held for minutes, others for months. The system
experienced dramatic changes in its total balance and in its average transfer
velocity as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, and in response to known
administrative operations. Moreover, transaction rhythms differed substantially
between rural and urban areas, in particular, money moves faster in urban
communities. Successful macroeconomic policies require understanding how
individuals experience the economy and when those experiences diverge. The
data-driven approach described in this paper improves our understanding of the
heterogeneity underlying macroeconomic indicators, and represents an advance in

between the model accuracy and real-time computational burden. One widely used
approximation method is the successive linearization MPC (SL-MPC) with EKF
method, in which the EKF algorithm is to handle unmeasured disturbances and
unavailable full states information. Inspired by this, an interpretative and
adaptive MPC (IA-MPC) method, is presented in this paper. In our IA-MPC method,
a linear state-space model is firstly obtained by performing the linearization
of a first-principle-based model at the initial point, and then this linear
state-space model is transformed into an equivalent ARX model. This
interpretative ARX model is then updated online by the EKF algorithm, which is
modified as a decoupled one without matrix-inverse operator. The corresponding
ARX-based MPC problem are solved by our previous construction-free, matrix-free
and library-free CDAL-ARX algorithm. This simple library-free C-code
implementation would significantly reduce the difficulty in deploying nonlinear
MPC on embedded platforms. The performance of the IA-MPC method is tested
against the nonlinear MPC with EKF and SL-MPC with EKF method in four typical
nonlinear benchmark examples, which show the effectiveness of our IA-MPC
method.

What's more, brain invasion in meningioma (i.e., the presence of tumor tissue
within the adjacent brain tissue) is an independent criterion for the grading
of meningioma and influences the treatment strategy. Although efforts have been
reported to address these two tasks, most of them rely on hand-crafted features
and there is no attempt to exploit the two prediction tasks simultaneously. In
this paper, we propose a novel task-aware contrastive learning algorithm to
jointly predict meningioma grade and brain invasion from multi-modal MRIs.
Based on the basic multi-task learning framework, our key idea is to adopt
contrastive learning strategy to disentangle the image features into
task-specific features and task-common features, and explicitly leverage their
inherent connections to improve feature representation for the two prediction
tasks. In this retrospective study, an MRI dataset was collected, for which 800
patients (containing 148 high-grade, 62 invasion) were diagnosed with
meningioma by pathological analysis. Experimental results show that the

a possible candidate for information storage technology. However, whether or
not lattice vibration directly participates in demagnetization has been highly
controversial over a decade. A recent electron diffraction experiment
attributed the demagnetization to the polarized phonon effect, but a similar
x-ray diffraction experiment attributed it to the Einstein-de Haas effect.
Common to both experiments is that neither the angular momentum of the lattice
nor the rotation of the sample was directly probed. Here, we report our first
first-principles calculation of forces on atoms induced by an ultrafast laser
during ultrafast demagnetization. We employ two complementary methods: (i) the
frozen lattice with electronic excitation and (ii) frozen excitation but moving
the lattice. We find that the forces on atoms start at -50 fs and peak around
30 fs. The magnitude of the force is far smaller than the empirical estimates.
Within the limit of our theory, our results suggest that the polarized phonon
effect and the Einstein-de Haas effect are unlikely to be the main course of
demagnetization. We expect that our finding has a profound impact on the future
direction of laser-induced dynamics in magnetic and quantum materials.

separately model the user-item interactions based on different latent factors

of interactions over latent factors from both semantic information in review

graphs. Then a factorized message passing mechanism is designed to learn
disentangled user/item representations on the factor graphs, which enable us to
further characterize the interactions and adaptively combine the predicted
ratings from multiple factors via a devised attention mechanism. Finally, we
set two factor-wise contrastive learning objectives to alleviate the sparsity
issue and model the user/item and interaction features pertinent to each factor
more accurately. Empirical results over five benchmark datasets validate the
superiority of DGCLR over the state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis is

requires further research in designing MAE for patch-level WSIs. In this paper,
we investigate several design choices for MAE in histopathology. Furthermore,
we introduce a multi-modal MAE (MMAE) that leverages the specific
compositionality of Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) stained WSIs. We performed our
experiments on the public patch-level dataset NCT-CRC-HE-100K. The results show
that the MMAE architecture outperforms supervised baselines and other

Validating the credibility of such information is a difficult task that is

been used to train a machine learning model, is an important problem in data
provenance. The feasibility of the task has been demonstrated by existing
auditing techniques, e.g., shadow auditing methods, under certain conditions
such as the availability of label information and the knowledge of training
protocols for the target model. Unfortunately, both of these conditions are
often unavailable in real applications. In this paper, we introduce Data
Provenance via Differential Auditing (DPDA), a practical framework for auditing
data provenance with a different approach based on statistically significant
differentials, i.e., after carefully designed transformation, perturbed input
data from the target model's training set would result in much more drastic
changes in the output than those from the model's non-training set. This
framework allows auditors to distinguish training data from non-training ones
without the need of training any shadow models with the help of labeled output

an additive one and a multiplicative one. We report evaluations on real-world

recording (e.g., keeping the same lane for 10 minutes on a highway). In this
paper, we propose a novel test reduction and prioritization approach for
multi-module ADS. First, our approach automatically encodes frames in a driving

redundant segments with the same vector are removed. The remaining segments are
prioritized based on both the coverage and the rarity of driving scenes. We
implemented this approach on an industry level, multi-module ADS called Apollo

sub-optimal solutions that serve to impede the evolution and maintenance of a
system. Some claim that the broken windows theory (BWT), a concept borrowed
from criminology, also applies to software development projects. The theory
states that the presence of indications of previous crime (such as a broken
window) will increase the likelihood of further criminal activity; TD could be
considered the broken windows of software systems. Objective: To empirically
investigate the causal relationship between the TD density of a system and the
propensity of developers to introduce new TD during the extension of that
system. Method: The study used a mixed-methods research strategy consisting of
a controlled experiment with an accompanying survey and follow-up interviews.
The experiment had a total of 29 developers of varying experience levels
completing a system extension tasks in an already existing systems with high or
low TD density. The solutions were scanned for TD. Six subjects participated in
follow-up interviews, where the results were analyzed using thematic analysis.
Result: The analysis revealed significant effects of TD level on the subjects'
tendency to re-implement (rather than reuse) functionality, choose
non-descriptive variable names, and introduce other code smells, all with at
least 95% credible intervals. Additionally, the developers appeared to be, at
least partially, aware of when they had introduced TD. Conclusion: Three
separate significant results along with a validating qualitative result combine
to form substantial evidence of the BWT's applicability to software engineering
contexts. Existing TD has a major impact on developers propensity to introduce
new TD of various types during development. While mimicry seems to be part of
the explanation it can not alone describe the observed effects.

strategy is driven by reinforcement learning, where a controller network is
trained in such a way to determine an optimal number of nodes to be

sufficient network capacities. The parameter learning strategy is underpinned
by the concept of Dark Experience replay method to cope with the catastrophic

location-based social networks, yet remains challenging due to a high degree of

explore the latent hierarchical structure composed of multi-granularity
short-term structural patterns in user check-in sequences. We propose a
Spatio-Temporal context AggRegated Hierarchical Transformer (STAR-HiT) for next
POI recommendation, which employs stacked hierarchical encoders to recursively
encode the spatio-temporal context and explicitly locate subsequences of
different granularities. More specifically, in each encoder, the global
attention layer captures the spatio-temporal context of the sequence, while the
local attention layer performed within each subsequence enhances subsequence
modeling using the local context. The sequence partition layer infers positions
and lengths of subsequences from the global context adaptively, such that
semantics in subsequences can be well preserved. Finally, the subsequence
aggregation layer fuses representations within each subsequence to form the
corresponding subsequence representation, thereby generating a new sequence of
higher-level granularity. The stacking of encoders captures the latent
hierarchical structure of the check-in sequence, which is used to predict the
next visiting POI. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves superior performance whilst providing
explanations for recommendations. Codes are available at

improve the performance of classifiers, especially in low-resource scenarios.
Most previous methods conduct text augmentation without considering the
different functionalities of the words in the text, which may generate
unsatisfactory samples. Different words may play different roles in text
classification, which inspires us to strategically select the proper roles for
text augmentation. In this work, we first identify the relationships between
the words in a text and the text category from the perspectives of statistical
correlation and semantic similarity and then utilize them to divide the words
into four roles -- Gold, Venture, Bonus, and Trivial words, which have
different functionalities for text classification. Based on these word roles,
we present a new augmentation technique called STA (Selective Text
Augmentation) where different text-editing operations are selectively applied
to words with specific roles. STA can generate diverse and relatively clean
samples, while preserving the original core semantics, and is also quite simple
to implement. Extensive experiments on 5 benchmark low-resource text
classification datasets illustrate that augmented samples produced by STA
successfully boost the performance of classification models which significantly
outperforms previous non-selective methods, including two large language
model-based techniques. Cross-dataset experiments further indicate that STA can
help the classifiers generalize better to other datasets than previous methods.

suggest that GCs harbouring a BHS are slightly heavier and with larger

of binary BHs (BBHs) that have either merged in the last 3 Gyr or survived in
their parent cluster until present-day. We find that around 80\% of the merging
BBHs form due to dynamical interactions while the remaining originate from
evolution of primordial binaries. We infer a merger rate for BBHs in the local
Universe of $1.0-23\,\,\rm{yr^{-1}\,Gpc^{-3}}$, depending on the adopted
assumptions. We find around 100-240 BBHs survive until present-day and are
mostly concentrated in the inner few kpc of the galaxy. We estimate also the

visual odometry is still widely used for its price advantage. Conventionally,
the task of visual odometry mainly rely on the input of continuous images.
However, it is very complicated for the odometry network to learn the epipolar
geometry information provided by the images. In this paper, the concept of
pseudo-LiDAR is introduced into the odometry to solve this problem. The
pseudo-LiDAR point cloud back-projects the depth map generated by the image
into the 3D point cloud, which changes the way of image representation.
Compared with the stereo images, the pseudo-LiDAR point cloud generated by the
stereo matching network can get the explicit 3D coordinates. Since the 6
Degrees of Freedom (DoF) pose transformation occurs in 3D space, the 3D
structure information provided by the pseudo-LiDAR point cloud is more direct
than the image. Compared with sparse LiDAR, the pseudo-LiDAR has a denser point
cloud. In order to make full use of the rich point cloud information provided
by the pseudo-LiDAR, a projection-aware dense odometry pipeline is adopted.
Most previous LiDAR-based algorithms sampled 8192 points from the point cloud
as input to the odometry network. The projection-aware dense odometry pipeline
takes all the pseudo-LiDAR point clouds generated from the images except for
the error points as the input to the network. While making full use of the 3D
geometric information in the images, the semantic information in the images is
also used in the odometry task. The fusion of 2D-3D is achieved in an
image-only based odometry. Experiments on the KITTI dataset prove the
effectiveness of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
visual odometry method using pseudo-LiDAR.

systematic analysis (not end-user study though) that comprises eight carefully
designed security tests and covers the entire course of opening, displaying,

security findings: (1) about 30% of the tested apps fail to provide enough URL

all custom IABIs have various problems in providing sufficient indicators to
faithfully display an in-app page to users, whereas ten IABIs that are based on
Chrome Custom Tabs and SFSafariViewController are generally secure; and (3)
only a few IABIs give warnings to remind users of the risk of inputting

empirical mass and radius data of stable nuclei. Thus, the $K_0$ and $L$

clear correlations among interaction and saturation parameters. Furthermore, we
assume that the surface energy of the OI model is twice as large as the
gradient energy using the size equilibrium conditions of the ILD and OI models.
Then, the four energies of the ILD and OI models agree well for stable nuclei

currents can be described using a complex functional, or a non-Hermitian (NH)
Hamiltonian. We study the dynamics of two exchange-coupled spins on the Bloch
sphere. In the case of currents leading to PT symmetry, an exceptional point
that survives also in the nonlinear system is identified. The nonlinear system
is bistable for small currents and it exhibits stable oscillating motion or it
can relax to a fixed point. The oscillating motion of the two spins is akin to
synchronized spin-torque oscillators. For the full nonlinear system, we derive
two conserved quantities that furnish a geometric description of the spin
trajectories in phase space and indicate stability of the oscillating motion.
Our analytical results provide tools for the description of the dynamics of NH

local moments, forming interacting spins lattices. In the case of benzenoid
nanographenes, the Ovchinnikov-Lieb rules anticipate the spin of the ground
state of the superstructure, and thereby the sign of the intermolecular
exchange. Here we address the underlying microscopic mechanisms for
intermolecular exchange in this type of system. We find that, in general, three
different mechanisms contribute. First, Hund's ferromagnetic exchange that
promotes ferromagnetic interactions of electrons in overlapping orbitals.
Second, superexchange driven by intermolecular hybridization, identical to
Anderson kinetic exchange, which is a decreasing function of the Hubbard-$U$
energy scale, and is always antiferromagnetic. Third, a Coulomb-driven
superexchange, that increases as a function of $U$, and involves virtual
excitation of excited molecular orbitals that are extended over the entire
structure. We find that Coulomb-driven superexchange can be either ferro or
antiferromagnetic, accounting for Ovchinnikov-Lieb rules. We compute these
exchange energies for the case of coupled $S=1/2$ phenalenyl triangulenes,
using multi-configurational methods both with Hubbard and extended Hubbard
models, thereby addressing the influence of long-range Coulomb interactions on
the exchange interactions.

intrinsically transient nature. The tidal ring structures are the result of
strong interactions between gas-rich stellar disks and smaller galactic systems
and do not last longer than ~500~Myr therefore, these are perfect scenarios
where to find the debris of recently accreted dwarf galactic systems. We
present new deep images of the NGC 922 tidal ring galaxy and its surroundings
from the DESI Legacy survey data and from our observations with an amateur
telescope. These observations are compared with results from high-resolution
N-body simulations designed to reproduce an alternative formation scenario for
this peculiar galaxy. Our new observations unveil that the low surface
brightness stellar tidal structures around NGC 922 are much more complex than
reported in previous works. In particular, the formerly detected tidal
spike-like structure at the northeast of the central galaxy disk is not
connected with the dwarf companion galaxy PGC3080368, which has been suggested
as the intruder triggering the ring formation of NGC 922. The deep images
reveal that this tidal structure is mainly composed by a fainter giant
umbrella-like shape and thus it was formed from the tidal disruption of a
different satellite. Using the broad-band g, r and z DESI LS images, we
measured the photometric properties of this stellar stream, estimating a total
absolute magnitude in r-band of Mr= -17.0 +/- 0.03 magn and a total stellar
mass for the stream between 6.9-8.5X10^8 Mo. We perform a set of N-body
simulations to reproduce the observed NGC 922-intruder interaction, suggesting
a new scenario for the formation of its tidal ring from the in-fall of a gas

the minimum degree of a real polynomial $p$ that approximates $f$ pointwise:
$|f(x)-p(x)|\leq1/3$ for all $x\in\{0,1\}^n.$ For every $\delta>0,$ we
construct CNF and DNF formulas of polynomial size with approximate degree
$\Omega(n^{1-\delta}),$ essentially matching the trivial upper bound of $n.$
This improves polynomially on previous lower bounds and fully resolves the
approximate degree of constant-depth circuits ($\text{AC}^0$), a question that
has seen extensive research over the past 10 years. Previously, an
$\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$ lower bound was known only for $\text{AC}^0$ circuits of
depth that grows with $1/\delta$ (Bun and Thaler, FOCS 2017). Moreover, our CNF
and DNF formulas are the simplest possible in that they have constant width.
Our result holds even for one-sided approximation, and has the following
further consequences.
  (i) We essentially settle the communication complexity of $\text{AC}^0$
circuits in the bounded-error quantum model, $k$-party number-on-the-forehead
randomized model, and $k$-party number-on-the-forehead nondeterministic model:
we prove that for every $\delta>0$, these models require
$\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$, $\Omega(n/4^kk^2)^{1-\delta}$, and
$\Omega(n/4^kk^2)^{1-\delta}$, respectively, bits of communication even for
polynomial-size constant-width CNF formulas.
  (ii) In particular, we show that the multiparty communication class
$\text{coNP}_k$ can be separated essentially optimally from $\text{NP}_k$ and
$\text{BPP}_k$ by a particularly simple function, a polynomial-size
constant-width CNF.
  (iii) We give an essentially tight separation, of $O(1)$ versus
$\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$, for the one-sided versus two-sided approximate degree
of a function; and $O(1)$ versus $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$ for the one-sided
approximate degree of a function $f$ versus its negation $\neg f$.

semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). Our core observation is that the
oscillating pseudo-targets undermine the training of an accurate detector. It
injects noise into the student's training, leading to severe overfitting
problems. Therefore, we propose a systematic solution, termed
ConsistentTeacher, to reduce the inconsistency. First, adaptive anchor
assignment~(ASA) substitutes the static IoU-based strategy, which enables the
student network to be resistant to noisy pseudo-bounding boxes. Then we
calibrate the subtask predictions by designing a 3D feature alignment
module~(FAM-3D). It allows each classification feature to adaptively query the
optimal feature vector for the regression task at arbitrary scales and
locations. Lastly, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) dynamically revises the score
threshold of pseudo-bboxes, which stabilizes the number of ground truths at an
early stage and remedies the unreliable supervision signal during training.
ConsistentTeacher provides strong results on a large range of SSOD evaluations.
It achieves 40.0 mAP with ResNet-50 backbone given only 10% of annotated
MS-COCO data, which surpasses previous baselines using pseudo labels by around
3 mAP. When trained on fully annotated MS-COCO with additional unlabeled data,

underwater locomotion. How swimming style affects fish schooling is
investigated by a representative problem setup consisting of two tethered
NACA0012 hydrofoils undulating in a free stream flow at various wavelengths $
\lambda^* = 0.8 - 8 $, front-back distance $ D = 0,\ 0.25,\ 0.5,\ 0.75 $, phase
difference $ \phi/\pi = 0,\ 0.5,\ 1,\ 1.5 $, and lateral gap distance $ G =
0.25,\ 0.3,\ 0.35 $ with fixed Reynolds number $ Re = 5000 $, Strouhal number $
St = 0.4 $, and maximum amplitude $ A_{max} = 0.1 $. In total, 336 cases were
simulated by open-source software IBAMR based on immersed boundary method. The
increase in wavelength generally leads to higher thrust and lateral force,
consistent with a previous study regarding a single swimmer. The highest Froude
efficiency is obtained at intermediate wavelength $ \lambda^* = 2 $ for either
individual or two foils as a group. At side-by-side arrangement $ D = 0 $, the
thrust force upon the two foils can be equivalent, indicating a stable
formation. At staggered arrangement, $ D > 0 $, the follower can take
significant advantage of the leader in locomotion performance by tuning phase
difference. The follower's benefit decreases with relative distance. Various
combinations of wavelength and relative distance can lead to distinct flow
structures, indicating a tunable stealth capacity of the schooling swimmers.

where the system either explicitly exists as graph or can be readily modelled

graph as a whole. In this paper, we are primarily concerned with the later,
that is, the inference that the structure of the graph influences the property
of the real life system it represents. A model of such structural influence
would be useful in inferencing useful properties of complex and large systems,

a graph representation which is lossless, linear-sized in terms of number of

based on Prufer encoding for trees. Moreover, our method is based on a novel
technique, called $\mathcal{GT}$-enhancement whereby we first transform the

provides scope to include additional graph property and improve the

the incorporation of suitable perception maps into the hybrid controller. These

predicts significant sub-Hubble correlators it is in disagreement with field

environments. In addition, we enhance the dynamic regret bound by exploiting
the multiple accesses of the gradient to the learner in each round. Empirical
results indicate that M-ADAGRAD works also well in practice.

generalization have the potential to be applied to difficult forms of sample or
distribution generalization. Transfer learning approaches to (3) domain

integrate image and text data and that apply a biologically-inspired network

in this work. This algorithm uses the epistemic uncertainty of each training

samples is then increased for the next weak learner, producing a sequence that
progressively focuses on the samples found to have the highest uncertainty. In
the end, the weak learners' outputs are combined into a weighted ensemble of
classifiers. Three methods are proposed to manipulate the training set:
undersampling, oversampling, and weighting the training samples according to
the uncertainty estimated by the weak learners. Furthermore, two approaches are
studied regarding the ensemble combination. The weak learner herein considered
is a standard convolutional neural network, and the probabilistic models
underlying the uncertainty estimation use either variational inference or Monte
Carlo dropout. The experimental evaluation carried out on MNIST benchmark
datasets shows that ProBoost yields a significant performance improvement. The
results are further highlighted by assessing the relative achievable
improvement, a metric proposed in this work, which shows that a model with only
four weak learners leads to an improvement exceeding 12% in this metric (for
either accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity), in comparison to the model
learned without ProBoost.

from renewal theory of stochastic processes to obtain some semi-analytic

case of low interrogation frequency, to delayed dynamics reminiscent of the
Zeno effect if monitoring is frequent. For a semi-continuous spatial

displacement efficiency [Palak, R. Sathayanath, S. K. Kalpathy and R.
Bandyopadhyay, Colloids Surf. A Physicochem. Eng. Asp., 629 (2021) 127405]. In
the present work, we explore the miscible displacement of a dense aqueous
cornstarch suspension in its discontinuous shear-thickening regime in a
quasi-two-dimensional radial Hele-Shaw cell. We systematically study the growth
kinetics of the inner interface between water and the cornstarch suspension,
and also of the outer interface between the suspension and air. In addition to
the growth of interfacial instabilities at the inner interface, we observe a
transient withdrawal of the suspension and the formation of fingering
instabilities at the outer interface. We demonstrate that these `reverse
fingering' instabilities are extremely sensitive to the injection flow rate of
water, the gap of the Hele-Shaw cell and the concentration of the displaced
cornstarch suspension, {and emerge irrespective of immiscibility between the
fluid pair. We believe that as the cornstarch suspension dilates due to the
high shear rate imposed by the displacing fluid, the outer suspension-air
interface responds with a restoring force, resulting in the penetration of air
into the suspension and the formation of reverse fingers. We note that the
growth of reverse fingers significantly reduces the displacement efficiency of
the suspension. Finally, we demonstrate a correlation in the growth of inner
and outer interfacial patterns by computing the velocity with which stresses
propagate in the confined dense suspension. Our findings are useful in
understanding the flow of granular materials through constrained geometries and
can be extended to study stress propagation in shear-thickening materials due
to a sudden imposition of high shear rate, such as in impact behaviour.

short-term voltage instability. An effective way to address this problem is to
improve the system's dynamic voltage support capability by changing the
operation status of dynamic var devices, and the dynamic var reserve (DVR) is
commonly used. Due to the time delay in synchronous machine excitation systems,
the dynamic var reserved at steady state cannot be exploited immediately under
large disturbances. In addition, some reactive power is produced immediately
through electromagnetic induction. The voltage support effect of the two
capabilities is analyzed based on the flux linkage and an approximate
simulation of the fault impact. Then two novel indexes for evaluating the
voltage inertia and voltage recovery capability are proposed, which are related
to the voltage nadir and voltage recovery speed. The indexes' physical meanings
are revealed by comparison with the frequency response, and the potential
applications in planning and optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) are
introduced. Numerical simulations based on the IEEE 39-bus system verify that
the indexes can quantify the voltage support capabilities, and the minimum
voltage support requirements are obtained to maintain systems' security.

energy of either shock-accelerated electrons or - in the case of pulsar wind
nebulae - of electrons injected by the central pulsar. Otherwise, the break may
result from energy losses due to synchrotron aging or it is caused by
energy-dependent diffusion. A spectral steepening of the plerionic SNR CTB87 at
around 11 GHz was observed in the eighties, but a recent analysis of CTB87's
energetic properties based on new radio data raised doubt on it. CTB87 consists
of a central compact component surrounded by a diffuse centrally peaked almost
circular halo. Missing faint halo emission due to insufficient sensitivity of
early high-frequency observations may be be the reason for the reported
spectral break. We intend to clarify the high-frequency spectrum of CTB87 by
new sensitive observations. We used the broad-band 2-cm receiver at the
Effelsberg 100-m telescope for sensitive continuum observations of CTB87 and
its halo in two frequency bands. The new 2-cm maps of CTB87 show halo emission
with a diameter of about 17' or 30 pc for a distance of 6.1 kpc in agreement
with lower-frequency data. The measured flux densities are significantly higher
than those reported earlier. The new 2-cm data establish the high-frequency
continuation of CTB87's low-frequency spectrum. Any significant high-frequency
spectral bend or break is constrained to frequencies well above about 18 GHz.
The extended halo of CTB87 has a faint counterpart in gamma-rays (VER J2016+37)
and thus indicates a common origin of the emitting electrons.

how do such agency-related features relate to its physical state? Recent work
has proposed a notion of interpretation map, a function that maps the state of
a system to a probability distribution representing its beliefs about an
external world. Such a map is not completely arbitrary, as the beliefs it
attributes to the system must evolve over time in a manner that is consistent
with Bayes' theorem, and consequently the dynamics of a system constrain its
possible interpretations. Here we build on this approach, proposing a notion of
interpretation not just in terms of beliefs but in terms of goals and actions.
To do this we make use of the existing theory of partially observable Markov
processes (POMDPs): we say that a system can be interpreted as a solution to a
POMDP if it not only admits an interpretation map describing its beliefs about
the hidden state of a POMDP but also takes actions that are optimal according
to its belief state. An agent is then a system together with an interpretation
of this system as a POMDP solution. Although POMDPs are not the only possible
formulation of what it means to have a goal, this nevertheless represents a
step towards a more general formal definition of what it means for a system to
be an agent.

  Furthermore, we demonstrate that a single entry of the $f$-Convolution can be

task of the $f$-Query problem is to compute integer $(g \otimes_f

introduce the definition of the intrinsic asymmetry. This quantity reveals the
asymmetry in the distribution of the quark intrinsic transverse momentum. We
find that these asymmetries can be expressed in terms of the transverse
momentum dependent parton distribution functions and the electroweak couplings.
As a result, our calculations provide a set of new quantities for analyzing the
parton distribution functions and the electroweak couplings. It is helpful to
understand the hadronic weak interactions and strong interactions in the deeply
inelastic scattering process simultaneously.

temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ (YBCO) has
attracted great attention in the field of high-$T_{\mathrm{c}}$
superconductors. Since then, various theoretical and experimental studies have
been devoted to elucidating its microscopic origin. One prominent fingerprint
of the light-induced superconductivity is the emergence of $1/\omega$-like
spectral behavior in the imaginary part of the optical conductivity in the
terahertz (THz) frequency range. However, the spectral profile can also be
described by the Drude response of the quasiparticles (QPs) with a
substantially low scattering rate. To circumvent this critical ambiguity, we
investigated the light-induced nonequilibrium state in an underdoped YBCO
sample with $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of 61 K using the nonlinear THz optical response
originating from the SC collective excitation of the ac-driven Josephson
current. Upon the near-infrared (NIR) photoexcitation above $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in
the YBCO sample, the $1/\omega$-like spectral behavior in the imaginary part of
the optical conductivity emerges, consistent with the previous studies.
However, the THz third-harmonic generation arising from the ac-driven Josephson
current along the $c$-axis was absent in the NIR photoexcited state. These
results indicate that the NIR-pump induced state exhibiting the $1/\omega$-like
response above $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ is distinct from the long-range ordered SC
state in equilibrium. Based on these observations, the possible origins of the
irregularly coherent charge carrier response along the $c$-axis induced by the
photoexcitation are discussed.

increasing attention. It is necessary to train a model only on source domain

to be processed in real time and cannot be reused for training. Based on the
idea of domain generalization, a Single-source Domain Expansion Network
(SDEnet) is developed to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of domain
extension. The method uses generative adversarial learning to train in SD and
test in TD. A generator including semantic encoder and morph encoder is
designed to generate the extended domain (ED) based on
encoder-randomization-decoder architecture, where spatial and spectral
randomization are specifically used to generate variable spatial and spectral
information, and the morphological knowledge is implicitly applied as domain
invariant information during domain expansion. Furthermore, the supervised
contrastive learning is employed in the discriminator to learn class-wise
domain invariant representation, which drives intra-class samples of SD and ED.
Meanwhile, adversarial training is designed to optimize the generator to drive
intra-class samples of SD and ED to be separated. Extensive experiments on two
public HSI datasets and one additional multispectral image (MSI) dataset
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method when compared with
state-of-the-art techniques.

for highly ionic insulators like LiF, while self-consistent DFT-1/2 should
still be used for other compounds. Nevertheless, there is no quantitative
criterion prescribed for which implementation should work for an arbitrary
insulator, which leads to severe ambiguity in this method. In this work we
analyze the impact of self-consistency in DFT-1/2 and shell DFT-1/2
calculations in insulators or semiconductors with ionic bonds, covalent bonds
and intermediate cases, and show that self-consistency is required even for
highly ionic insulators for globally better electronic structure details. The
self-energy correction renders electrons more localized around the anions in
self-consistent LDA-1/2. The well-known delocalization error of LDA is
rectified, but with strong overcorrection due to the presence of additional
self-energy potential. However, in non-self-consistent LDA-1/2 calculations,
the electron wavefunctions indicate that such localization is much more severe
and beyond a reasonable range, because the strong Coulomb repulsion is not
counted in the Hamiltonian. Another common drawback of non-self-consistent
LDA-1/2 lies in that the ionicity of the bonding gets substantially enhanced,

precision and simultaneously reduce false positives. First, these classifiers
are trained on two original benchmark unbalanced fraud detection datasets,

simple as they appear, cannot be achieved experimentally by NISQ computers, and
can not be constructed without quantum fault-tolerance.

holes with their host galaxy, it is crucial to measure the black hole mass of
AGN. Reverberation mapping is a unique tool to estimate the black hole masses
in AGN. We performed spectroscopic reverberation study using long-term
monitoring data with more than 100 spectra of a radio-loud quasar PKS 0736+017
to estimate the size of the broad line region (BLR) and black hole mass. The
optical spectrum shows strong H$\mathrm{\beta}$ and H$\mathrm{\gamma}$ emission
lines. We generated the light curves of 5100{\AA} continuum flux ($f_{5100}$),
H$\beta$, and H$\gamma$. All the light curves are found to be strongly variable
with fractional variability of 69$\%$, 21$\%$, 30$\%$ for V-band, H$\beta$, and
H$\gamma$ light curves, respectively. Along with the thermal contribution,
non-thermal emission contributes to the estimated continuum luminosity at
5100\AA. Using different methods, e.g., CCF, {\small JAVELIN}, von-neumann, we
estimated the size of the BLR, which is found to be 66.4$^{+6.0}_{-4.2}$ light
days in the rest frame. The BLR size combined with the line width of H$\beta$
provides a black hole mass of 7.32$^{+0.89}_{-0.91} \times 10^{7}M_{\odot}$.
The source closely follows the BLR size-luminosity relation of AGN.

  Proximal Gradient Method",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distilling physical laws autonomously from data has been of great interest in
many scientific areas. The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)
and its variations have been developed to extract the underlying governing
equations from observation data. However, SINDy faces certain difficulties when
the dynamics contain rational functions. The principle of the least action
governs many mechanical systems, mathematically expressed in the Lagrangian
formula. Compared to the actual equation of motions, the Lagrangian is much
more concise, especially for complex systems, and does not usually contain
rational functions for mechanical systems. Only a few methods have been
proposed to extract the Lagrangian from measurement data so far. One of such
methods, Lagrangian-SINDy, can extract the true form of Lagrangian of dynamical
systems from data but suffers when noises are present. In this work, we develop
an extended version of Lagrangian-SINDy (xL-SINDy) to obtain the Lagrangian of
dynamical systems from noisy measurement data. We incorporate the concept of
SINDy and utilize the proximal gradient method to obtain sparse expressions of
the Lagrangian. We demonstrated the effectiveness of xL-SINDy against different
noise levels with four nonlinear dynamics: a single pendulum, a cart-pendulum,
a double pendulum, and a spherical pendulum. Furthermore, we also verified the
performance of xL-SINDy against SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a recent robust
variant of SINDy that can handle implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities.
Our experiment results show that xL-SINDy is 8-20 times more robust than
SINDy-PI in the presence of noise.

generalization. This paper introduces deep learning techniques under the
data-driven framework to address these fundamental issues in nonlinear
materials modeling. To this end, an autoencoder neural network architecture is
introduced to learn the underlying low-dimensional representation (embedding)
of the given material database. The offline trained autoencoder and the
discovered embedding space are then incorporated in the online data-driven
computation such that the search of optimal material state from database can be
performed on a low-dimensional space, aiming to enhance the robustness and
predictability with projected material data. To ensure numerical stability and
representative constitutive manifold, a convexity-preserving interpolation
scheme tailored to the proposed autoencoder-based data-driven solver is
proposed for constructing the material state. In this study, the applicability
of the proposed approach is demonstrated by modeling nonlinear biological
tissues. A parametric study on data noise, data size and sparsity, training
initialization, and model architectures, is also conducted to examine the
robustness and convergence property of the proposed approach.

is strong enough to affect the trajectory of ions passing through capillaries
and consequently to diminish the fraction of transmitted beam ions. We
calculated the theoretically transmitted fraction, using an approached but

ion and an infinite cylindrical dielectric interface. When comparing the
theoretically transmitted fraction to available experimental data for
nano-capillaries with an inner diameter of less than 200 nm, we found a
surprisingly large disagreement, i.e., the theoretically transmitted fractions
were easily an order of magnitude lower than the experimental ones. Noting that
the image charge force depends on the velocity of the ion via the frequency
dependent relative permittivity of the insulator, we investigated whether the
disagreement could be lifted using a velocity depend image charge force. We
give the exact expressions of the dynamical image charge force for a plane and
cylindrical dielectric interface as a function of the ion velocity. We then
re-evaluated the theoretically transmitted fractions in the case of SiO$_2$ and

context of Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, we observe an interesting
one-epoch overfitting problem: the model performance exhibits a dramatic
degradation at the beginning of the second epoch. Such a phenomenon has been
witnessed widely in real-world applications of CTR models. Thereby, the best
performance is usually achieved by training with only one epoch. To understand
the underlying factors behind the one-epoch phenomenon, we conduct extensive
experiments on the production data set collected from the display advertising

algorithm with a fast convergence rate, and the feature sparsity are closely

requiring both Einstein general relativity and the Higgs scalar field model to

gravitational effects that explain anomalous galactic rotation, currently
accelerating Hubble expansion, and dark galactic halos, without invoking dark
matter. This implies different values $G_n$ and $G_p$ for neutron and proton,
respectively, but retains the Einstein equivalence principle for test objects
accelerated by a given gravitational field. Isotopic mass defect $\mu$ per

design of the autocomplete function is proposed to increase effectiveness by
more than 10%. With the new design, the effectiveness of autocomplete can reach
