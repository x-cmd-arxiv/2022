waves and, subsequently, a background of stochastic gravitational waves.
Currently, predictions of these gravitational waves rely heavily on simulations

providing the latent heat of the phase transition. Numerically, this is a
rather demanding task since several length scales enter the dynamics. From
smallest to largest, these are the thickness of the Higgs interface separating
the different phases, the shell thickness of the sound waves, and the average

the same time removing the hierarchically smallest scale from the lattice. This
significantly reduces the complexity of the problem and contributes to making
our approach highly efficient. We provide spectra for the produced

While different images with different quality consume different amounts of

consumption of an operation in a typical image. This paper, first, investigates
that there is a correlation between energy consumption and image quality as
well as image file size. Therefore, these two can be considered as a proxy for
energy consumption. Then, we propose a multi-objective strategy to enhance
image quality and reduce image file size based on the quantisation tables in
JPEG image compression. To this end, we have used two general multi-objective
metaheuristic approaches: scalarisation and Pareto-based. Scalarisation methods
find a single optimal solution based on combining different objectives, while
Pareto-based techniques aim to achieve a set of solutions. In this paper, we
embed our strategy into five scalarisation algorithms, including energy-aware
multi-objective genetic algorithm (EnMOGA), energy-aware multi-objective
particle swarm optimisation (EnMOPSO), energy-aware multi-objective
differential evolution (EnMODE), energy-aware multi-objective evolutionary

Also, two Pareto-based methods, including a non-dominated sorting genetic
algorithm (NSGA-II) and a reference-point-based NSGA-II (NSGA-III) are used for
the embedding scheme, and two Pareto-based algorithms, EnNSGAII and EnNSGAIII,
are presented. Experimental studies show that the performance of the baseline
algorithm is improved by embedding the proposed strategy into metaheuristic

Each tissue section/component is defined by a unique combination of spatial and
spectral features, but given the high dimensionality of HSI datasets,
extracting and utilising them to segment images is non-trivial. Here, we show
how networks based on deep convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) can perform this
task in an end-to-end fashion by first detecting and compressing relevant
features from patches of the HSI into low-dimensional latent vectors, and then
performing a clustering step that groups patches containing similar
spatio-spectral features together. We showcase the advantages of using this
end-to-end spatio-spectral segmentation approach compared to i) the same
spatio-spectral technique not trained in an end-to-end manner, and ii) a method
that only utilises spectral features (spectral k-means) using simulated HSIs of
porcine tissue as test examples. Secondly, we describe the potential
advantages/limitations of using three different CAE architectures: a generic 2D
CAE, a generic 3D CAE, and a 2D CNN architecture inspired by the recently
proposed UwU-net that is specialised for extracting features from HSI data. We
assess their performance on IR HSIs of real colon samples. We find that all
architectures are capable of producing segmentations that show good
correspondence with HE stained adjacent tissue slices used as approximate
ground truths, indicating the robustness of the CAE-driven approach for

allows for resilient consensus with only local knowledge of the communication

paper, we show that a commonly used communication graph structure in robotics
literature, the communication graph built based on the Voronoi tessellation,
automatically results in a sufficiently connected graph to reject a single

reject two non-cooperative team members and provide a roadmap for modifications

underground labs. Such strongly interacting dark matter, however, can be probed
by dark matter experiments or other experiments operated on the ground level or
in the atmosphere. In this paper we carry out systematic analysis of two of
these experiments, XQC and CSR, to compute the experimental constraints on the
strongly interacting dark matter in the following three scenarios: (1)
spin-independent and spin-dependent interactions; (2) different velocity
dependent cross sections; (3) different dark matter mass fractions. Some of the

region has some non-trivial dependencies on the various parameters and the
limits in the spin-dependent case is quite different from the spin-independent

disappears, is also found in our Monte Carlo simulations. This occurs in the
case where the interaction cross section is proportional to the square of the

  In this article we argue that accounting for the propagation of uncertainty
from data sources all the way through extraction of information and hypothesis
testing is necessary to understand how user trust in a visual analytics system
evolves over its lifecycle, and that the analyst's selection of visualization
parameters affords us a simple means to capture the interactions between
uncertainty and cognitive bias as a function of the attributes of the search
tasks the analyst executes while evaluating explanations. We sample a broad
cross-section of the literature from visual analytics, human cognitive theory,

redshift, the H$\beta$ line is a reliable SFR tracer (scatter of 0.19dex) and
the [OII] line gives an equally good estimation when the metallicity from the

GSWLC). A calibration based on [OIII] retrieves the SFR only when additional
information such as the metallicity or the ionization parameter of galaxies are
used (0.26 for VIPERS and 0.20dex for GSWLC), diminishing its usability as a
direct SFR tracer. Based on rest-frame luminosities estimated with CIGALE, we

no advantage over the same algorithms started from scratch. Doerr et al. also
proposed a diversity mechanism to overcome this problem. Their approach
balances greedy search around a best-so-far solution for the current problem

propose a modification of their algorithm which interpolates between greedy

evaluate our smoothed re-optimization algorithm on LeadingOnes instances with

that it outperforms both a fully restarted (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm and the

However, the large amplitude motions present in many low-frequency

reduced density matrix. In out-of-equilibrium situations, e.g. after a quantum

The OE of a reduced density matrix initially grows linearly as entanglement
builds up between the local degrees of freedom, it then reaches a maximum, and
ultimately decays to a small finite value as the reduced density matrix
converges to a simple stationary state through standard thermalization
mechanisms. Here, by performing a new data analysis of the published
experimental results of [Brydges et al., Science 364, 260 (2019)], we obtain
the first experimental measurement of the OE of a subsystem reduced density
matrix in a quantum many-body system. We employ the randomized measurements
toolbox and we introduce and develop a new efficient method to post-process
experimental data in order to extract higher-order density matrix functionals
and access the OE. The OE thus obtained displays the expected barrier as long
as the experimental system is large enough. For smaller systems, we observe a
barrier with a double-peak structure, whose origin can be interpreted in terms
of pairs of quasi-particles being reflected at the boundary of the qubit chain.
As $U(1)$ symmetry plays a key role in our analysis, we introduce the notion of
symmetry resolved operator entanglement (SROE), in addition to the total OE. To
gain further insights into the SROE, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis
of this new quantity in chains of non-interacting fermions, which, in spite of
their simplicity, capture most of the main features of OE and SROE. In
particular, we uncover three main physical effects: the presence of a barrier
in any charge sector, a time delay for the onset of the growth of SROE, and an
effective equipartition between charge sectors.

incorporating information from many quantities in the solution to a relaxed or

discuss how, limiting the WKB expansion to the first order of approximation, it
is possible to recover for the quantum subsystem a Schr\""odinger equation as
written on the classical gravitational background. We give some applications
for the quantum subsystem in the ""corner"" configuration of the Bianchi IX

degrees of freedom. The most surprising result is the possibility to get a
non-singular Bianchi IX cosmology when the scenario is extrapolated backwards
in time. We also provide some basic hints on the extension of this result to
the generic cosmological solution. In the last part of the review, we consider
the same scheme to the next order of approximation identifying the quantum
subset as made of matter variables only. We deal with the very fundamental
problem of non-unitary morphology of the quantum gravity corrections to quantum
field theory discussing some proposed reformulations. Instead of constructing
the time dependence via that one of the classical gravitational variables on
the label time, we analyse a recent proposal to construct time by fixing a
reference frame. This scheme can be reached both introducing the so-called

both cases, the Schr\""odinger equation, amended for quantum gravity
corrections, has the same morphology and we provide a cosmological

variability phenomena, among them the magnetic activity of the order of a few
hours until the signature of an extra-solar planet which can cover a scale of
time of a few days until tens of years. Numerous instruments are being
developed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets. Exoplanets with this dimension
challenge scientific instrumentation and the field of research in the data
processing. In this context, our study offers a powerful framework to explain
dynamical properties as a function of timescale in light curves with the
planetary signal. For that, we selected the stellar target Kepler-30 to test
our methods and procedures. In this sense, we investigate the multifractal
behavior of the Kepler-30 system composed of a sun-like star with a rotation
period of ~16 days and three planets with masses between 2 Earth and 2.5
Jupiter masses. Furthermore, this system has an orbital period varying from 29
to 143 days and orbits almost coplanar. This system is highly interesting
because starspots dynamics are strongly affected by the passing of a planet in
front of the star. We used about 1600 days of high-precision photometry
collected by the Kepler mission to investigate the quasi-periodic variation
caused by the rotation of the star and the effect of spot evolution as a
function of timescale. We applied indexes extract from multifractal analysis to
model the flux rotational modulation induced by active regions. Our results
that stellar flux variations in Kepler-30 star caused by rotational modulation
can be replicated in detail with just four recent-known multifractal indexes.
These indexes will greatly simplify spot modelling of current TESS and future
PLATO data.

private federated submodel learning (FSL), where a machine learning model is
divided into multiple submodels based on the different types of data used to
train the model. In PRUW, each user downloads the required submodel without
revealing its index in the reading phase, and uploads the updates of the
submodel without revealing the submodel index or the values of the updates in
the writing phase. In this work, we first provide a basic communication
efficient PRUW scheme, and study further means of reducing the communication
cost via sparsification. Gradient sparsification is a widely used concept in
learning applications, where only a selected set of parameters is downloaded
and updated, which significantly reduces the communication cost. In this paper,
we study how the concept of sparsification can be incorporated in private FSL
with the goal of reducing the communication cost, while guaranteeing
information theoretic privacy of the updated submodel index as well as the
values of the updates. To this end, we introduce two schemes: PRUW with top $r$
sparsification and PRUW with random sparsification. The former communicates
only the most significant parameters/updates among the servers and the users,
while the latter communicates a randomly selected set of parameters/updates.
The two proposed schemes introduce novel techniques such as parameter/update
(noisy) permutations to handle the additional sources of information leakage in
PRUW caused by sparsification. Both schemes result in significantly reduced
communication costs compared to that of the basic (non-sparse) PRUW scheme.

case of many noisy channels, the degradation can be partially prevented by
using local unitary operations. We consider the effect of local noise on shared
quantum states and evaluate the amount of entanglement that can be preserved
from deterioration. The amount of saved entanglement not only depends on the
strength of the channel but also on the type of the channel, and in particular,
it always vanishes for the depolarizing channel. The main motive of this work
is to analyze the reason behind this dependency of saved entanglement by
inspecting properties of the corresponding channels. In this context, we
quantify and explore the biasnesses of channels towards the different states on
which they act. We postulate that all biasness measures must vanish for
depolarizing channels, and subsequently introduce a few measures of biasness.
We also consider the entanglement capacities of channels. We observe that the
joint behaviour of the biasness quantifiers and the entanglement capacity
explains the nature of saved entanglement. Furthermore, we find a pair of upper
bounds on saved entanglement which are noticed to imitate the graphical nature
of the latter.

high-sensitivity CMB experiment, providing high-fidelity systematic error
propagation capabilities unmatched by any other means. In this paper, we
address an important issue regarding such simulations, namely how to define the
inputs in terms of sky model and instrument parameters. These may either be
taken as a constrained realization derived from the data, or as a random
realization independent from the data. We refer to these as Bayesian and
frequentist simulations, respectively. We show that the two options lead to
significantly different correlation structures, as frequentist simulations,
contrary to Bayesian simulations, effectively include cosmic variance, but
exclude realization-specific correlations from non-linear degeneracies.
Consequently, they quantify fundamentally different types of uncertainties, and
we argue that they therefore also have different and complementary scientific
uses, even if this dichotomy is not absolute. Before BeyondPlanck, most
pipelines have used a mix of constrained and random inputs, and used the same
hybrid simulations for all applications, even though the statistical
justification for this is not always evident. BeyondPlanck represents the first
end-to-end CMB simulation framework that is able to generate both types of
simulations, and these new capabilities have brought this topic to the
forefront. The Bayesian BeyondPlanck simulations and their uses are described
extensively in a suite of companion papers. In this paper we consider one
important applications of the corresponding frequentist simulations, namely
code validation. That is, we generate a set of 1-year LFI 30 GHz frequentist
simulations with known inputs, and use these to validate the core low-level
BeyondPlanck algorithms; gain estimation, correlated noise estimation, and
mapmaking.

document, these measurements are critical for addressing some of the most
fundamental questions in solar and heliospheric physics today, including: (1)
What is the origin of the magnetic field observed in the solar atmosphere? (2)
What is the coupling between magnetic fields and flows throughout the solar
atmosphere? Accurate measurements of the photospheric and chromospheric
three-dimensional magnetic fields are required for a precise determination of
the emergence and evolution of active regions. Newly emerging magnetic flux in
pre-existing magnetic regions causes an increase in the topological complexity
of the magnetic field, which leads to flares and coronal mass ejections.
Measurements of the vector magnetic field constitute also the primary product
for space weather operations, research, and modeling of the solar atmosphere
and heliosphere. The proposed next generation Ground-based solar Observing
Network Group (ngGONG), a coordinated system of multi-platform instruments,
will address these questions and provide large datasets for statistical
investigations of solar feature behavior and evolution and continuity in
monitoring for space-weather focused endeavors both research and operational.
It will also enable sun-as-a-star investigations, crucial as we look toward

various modes beyond, but as strong as, the typical $(2,2)$ mode; and vi) the
possibility of a broad alignment of the angular momentum of the disk with the

and resembles a solid body rotation. Our simulations suggest that any
electromagnetic luminosity from our models may power relativistic jets, such as
those characterizing short gamma-ray bursts. Depending on the black hole-disk

types is poorly constrained. Foreground CGMs contribute an extra amount to the
dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRB). We measure this DM excess
for the CGMs of $10^{11}-10^{13}\ M_\odot$ halos using the CHIME/FRB first data
release, a halo mass range that is challenging to probe in any other way.
Because of the uncertainty in the FRBs' angular coordinates, only for nearby
galaxies is the localization sufficient to confidently associate them with
intersecting any foreground halo. Thus we stack on galaxies within 80 Mpc,
optimizing the stacking scheme to approximately minimize the stack's variance
and marginalize over uncertainties in FRB locations. The sample has 20-30 FRBs
intersecting halos with masses of $10^{11}-10^{12}\ M_\odot$ and also of
$10^{12}-10^{13}\ M_\odot$, and these intersections allow a marginal
$1-2\,\sigma$ detection of the DM excess in both mass bins. The
$10^{11}-10^{12}\ M_\odot$ halos bin also shows a DM excess at 1-2 virial
radii. By comparing data with different models for the CGM gas profile, we find
that all models are favored by the data up to 2-$\sigma$ level compared to the
null hypothesis of no DM excess. With 2000-3000 more bursts from a future CHIME
data release, we project a 4-$\sigma$ detection of the CGM. Distinguishing
between viable CGM models by stacking FRBs with CHIME-like localization would
require tens of thousands of bursts.

dimension-six coupling to leptons in addition to quarks and gluons. We identify
parameter space in which these scalars decay promptly and propose a search for
such particles in final states with two jets and an opposite-charge lepton

criteria on the proposed signal and its leading backgrounds to project the

observatories will detect a larger number of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers
with increasing accuracy. In this context, improving BNS merger numerical
simulations is crucial to correctly interpret the data and constrain the
equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars (NSs). State-of-the-art simulations of
BNS mergers do not include muons. However, muons are known to be relevant in
the microphysics of cold NSs and are expected to have a significant role in
mergers, where the typical thermodynamic conditions favour their production.
Our work is aimed at investigating the impact of muons on the merger remnant.
We post-process the outcome of four numerical relativity simulations of BNS
mergers performed with three different baryonic EOSs and two mass ratios
considering the first $15$ milliseconds after merger. We compute the abundance
of muons in the remnant and analyse how muons affect the trapped neutrino
component and the fluid pressure. We find that depending on the baryonic EOS,
the net fraction of muons is between $30 \%$ and $70 \%$ the net fraction of
electrons. Muons change the flavour hierarchy of trapped (anti-)neutrinos such
that deep inside the remnant, muon anti-neutrinos are the most abundant,
followed by electron anti-neutrinos. Finally, muons and trapped neutrinos
modify the neutron-to-proton ratio, affecting the remnant pressure by up to
$7\%$ when compared with calculations neglecting them. This work demonstrates
that muons have a non-negligible effect on the outcome of BNS merger
simulations, and they should be included to improve the accuracy of a

natural explanation of the smallness of neutrino masses but, unlike their

approximate lepton number symmetry arranges the heavy neutrinos in pseudo-Dirac
pairs, which might be accessible at collider or even beam dump experiments if
their mass is low enough and their mixing with the active neutrinos
sufficiently large. Despite their pseudo-Dirac nature, their small mass
splittings may lead to oscillations that prevent the cancellation of their

disc galaxies, short-lived (S) versus long-lived (L) clumps and two L
sub-types, via analytic modeling tested against simulations. We develop a
criterion for clump survival, with or without their gas, based on a predictive
survivability parameter $S$. It compares the energy sources by supernova
feedback and gravitational contraction to the clump binding energy and losses
by outflows and turbulence dissipation. The clump properties are derived from
Toomre instability, approaching virial and Jeans equilibrium, and the supernova
energy deposit is based on an up-to-date bubble analysis. For moderate feedback
levels, we find that L clumps exist with circular velocities $\sim\!50\, km\,
s^{-1}$ and masses $\geq\!10^8\, M_\odot$. They are likely in galaxies with
circular velocities $\geq \!200\, km\, s^{-1}$, consistent at $z \sim 2$ with
the favored stellar mass for discs, $\geq\!10^{9.3}\, M_\odot$. L clumps favor
disc gas fractions $\geq\!0.3$, low-mass bulges and redshifts $z\!\sim\! 2$.
The likelihood of L clumps is reduced if the feedback is more ejective, e.g.,
if the supernovae are optimally clustered, if radiative feedback is very
strong, if the stellar initial mass function is top-heavy, or if the
star-formation-rate efficiency is particularly high. A sub-type of L clumps
(LS), which lose their gas in several free-fall times but retain bound stellar
components, may be explained by a smaller contraction factor and stronger
external gravitational effects, where clump mergers increase the SFR
efficiency. The more massive L clumps (LL) retain most of their baryons for
tens of free-fall times with a roughly constant star-formation rate.

subluminous (ZTF $g$-band absolute magnitude $M_g$ between $-18.2$ and $-18.7$
mag depending on the amount of host galaxy extinction) and shows an unusually
red color ($g_\mathrm{ZTF}-r_\mathrm{ZTF}$ between 0.4 and 0.2 mag) due to
strong line-blanketing blueward of $\sim$5000 $\r{A}$. These properties
resemble those of SN 2018byg, a peculiar SN Ia consistent with a thick He-shell
double detonation (DDet) SN. Using detailed radiative transfer models, we show
that the optical spectroscopic and photometric evolution of SN 2020jgb are

up to $\sim$$1.00\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ depending on the total host extinction)

helium in the outermost ejecta. While the sample size is limited, similar 1

candidates with NIR spectra obtained to date. SN 2020jgb is also the first
subluminous, thick He-shell DDet SN discovered in a star-forming galaxy,
indisputably showing that He-shell DDet objects occur in both star-forming and

and blueshifted on the other. Here, we investigate whether filament spins could
have a measurable kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) signal, from CMB photons
being scattered by moving ionised gas; this pure velocity information is
complementary to filament redshift-space shapes. We propose to measure the kSZ
dipole by combining galaxy redshift surveys with CMB experiments. We base our
S/N analyses first on an existing filament catalogue, and its combination with
Planck data. We then investigate the detectability of the kSZ dipole using the
combination of DESI or SKA-2 with next-stage CMB experiments. We find that the
gas halos of filament galaxies co-rotating with filaments induce a stronger kSZ
dipole signal than that from the diffuse filamentary gas, but both signals seem
too small to be detected in near-term surveys such as DESI+future CMB
experiments. But the combination of SKA-2 with future CMB experiments could
give a more than 10$\sigma$ detection. The gain comes mainly from an increased
area overlap and an increased number of filaments, but also the low noise and
high resolution in future CMB experiments are important to capture signals from
filaments small on the sky. Successful detection of the signals may help to
find the gravitomagnetic effect in large-scale structure and advance our
understanding of baryons in the cosmic web.

to the 4.4$\mu$m band. Their NIR colors are also consistent with young ($<$5
Myr) stellar populations and more than half of them are coincident with the MIR

matter perturbations are enhanced at large scales when compared with the ones
of the standard $\Lambda$CDM. The reason and impact of this trend on the

applicable to a single system, as opposed to Bell locality. It relies on
representing operationally indistinguishable procedures identically in an
ontological model. However, operational indistinguishability depends on the set
of operations that one may use to distinguish two procedures: we refer to this
set as the reference of indistinguishability. Thus, whether or not a given
experiment is noncontextual depends on the choice of reference. The choices of
references appearing in the literature are seldom discussed, but typically
relate to a notion of system underlying the experiment. This shift in
perspective then begs the question: how should one define the extent of the
system underlying an experiment? Our paper primarily aims at exposing this
question rather than providing a definitive answer to it. We start by
formulating a notion of relative noncontextuality for prepare-and-measure
scenarios, which is simply noncontextuality with respect to an explicit
reference of indistinguishability. We investigate how verdicts of relative
noncontextuality depend on this choice of reference, and in the process
introduce the concept of the noncontextuality graph of a prepare-and-measure
scenario. We then discuss several proposals that one may appeal to in order to
fix the reference to a specific choice, and relate these proposals to different
conceptions of what a system really is. With this discussion, we advocate that
whether or not an experiment is noncontextual is not as absolute as often
perceived.

the dataset-level category representations during network forward. After that,
we generate a class probability distribution for each pixel representation and
conduct the dataset-level context aggregation with the class probability
distribution as weights. Finally, the original pixel representations are
augmented with the aggregated dataset-level and the conventional image-level
contextual information. Moreover, in the inference phase, we additionally
design a coarse-to-fine iterative inference strategy to further boost the
segmentation results. MCIBI++ can be effortlessly incorporated into the
existing segmentation frameworks and bring consistent performance improvements.
Also, MCIBI++ can be extended into the video semantic segmentation framework
with considerable improvements over the baseline. Equipped with MCIBI++, we
achieved the state-of-the-art performance on seven challenging image or video

dynamically evolves with natural speech and movement. Utilizing this encoded
directivity representation, we train a machine learning model that leverages to
estimate the full, dynamic directivity pattern when given a limited set of

The ion spectrum is harder than the electron one, and both distributions get
steeper for higher $\beta$. We show that the energization of electrons is
accompanied by a significant energy-dependent pitch-angle anisotropy, with most
electrons moving parallel to the local magnetic field, while ions stay roughly
isotropic. We demonstrate that particle injection from the thermal pool occurs
in regions of high current density. Parallel electric fields associated with

Restriction enzymes, that cleave DNA at sequence-specific sites, are used to
selectively cut and remove rings from the network and hence tune the molecular
topology while maintaining overall structural integrity. We find that topology
has minimal effects over the spatial extension of the 2D network, however, it
significantly affects the relaxation behavior. The shape fluctuations of the
network are governed by two distinct characteristic time scales attributed to
the thermal fluctuations and confinement of the network. The relationship
between the time constant of thermal relaxation and the amplitude of anisotropy
fluctuations yields a universal scaling. Interestingly, this scaling is
independent of the detailed arrangements of rings and/or perforation within the

cumbersome and time-consuming acquisition requirement of measuring
susceptibility induced MR phase changes at multiple (usually more than six)

rotation angles due to physical constraints of the head coil. As a result, STI
has not yet been widely applied in human studies in vivo. In this work, we

  We show that our risk bound does not depend on the number of factors.
  In order to construct a covariance matrix estimator for asset returns, we
develop a novel data-dependent estimator of the error covariance matrix in deep

technique which is robust to outliers in the innovations. We prove that the
estimator is consistent in spectral norm. Then using that result, we show
consistency and rate of convergence of covariance matrix and precision matrix
estimator for asset returns. The rate of convergence in both results do not

  Various Monte Carlo simulations confirm our large sample findings and reveal
superior accuracies of the DNN-FM in estimating the true underlying functional

JAttack generates programs by executing templates and filling each hole by

qubits that are intentionally measured in a conjugate basis. We instantiate
this template in the quantum random oracle model (QROM) to obtain simple

  1. Non-interactive random-input bit OT in a model where parties share EPR
pairs a priori.
  2. Two-round random-input bit OT without setup, obtained by showing that the
protocol above remains secure even if the (potentially malicious) OT receiver
sets up the EPR pairs.

require at least five rounds.

optimal) adversaries. We first introduce an extensible decomposition of attacks
in adversarial machine learning by atomizing attack components into surfaces
and travelers. With our decomposition, we enumerate over components to create
576 attacks (568 of which were previously unexplored). Next, we propose the
Pareto Ensemble Attack (PEA): a theoretical attack that upper-bounds attack
performance. With our new attacks, we measure performance relative to the PEA
on: both robust and non-robust models, seven datasets, and three extended
lp-based threat models incorporating compute costs, formalizing the Space of
Adversarial Strategies. From our evaluation we find that attack performance to
be highly contextual: the domain, model robustness, and threat model can have a
profound influence on attack efficacy. Our investigation suggests that future
studies measuring the security of machine learning should: (1) be
contextualized to the domain & threat models, and (2) go beyond the handful of
known attacks used today.

target data, enabling a simpler adaptation of the model to the target
distribution in an unsupervised fashion. To this purpose, we included in our
framework UDA algorithms, such as multi-level adversarial alignment and
attentive entropy. By analyzing the challenge setting, we notice the presence
of a secondary concurrence shift in the data, which is usually called
environmental bias. It is caused by the existence of different environments,

extended our system to perform Multi-Source Multi-Target Domain Adaptation.

privacy concerns regarding the data that they use and share. If the data were
compromised, attackers could exploit user speech to bypass speaker verification
systems or even impersonate users. To mitigate this, we propose DeID-VC, a
speaker de-identification system that converts a real speaker to pseudo
speakers, thus removing or obfuscating the speaker-dependent attributes from a
spoken voice. The key components of DeID-VC include a Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) based Pseudo Speaker Generator (PSG) and a voice conversion Autoencoder
(AE) under zero-shot settings. With the help of PSG, DeID-VC can assign unique
pseudo speakers at speaker level or even at utterance level. Also, two novel
learning objectives are added to bridge the gap between training and inference
of zero-shot voice conversion. We present our experimental results with word
error rate (WER) and equal error rate (EER), along with three subjective
metrics to evaluate the generated output of DeID-VC. The result shows that our
method substantially improved intelligibility (WER 10% lower) and
de-identification effectiveness (EER 5% higher) compared to our baseline. Code

to understanding topology in photonic systems yield fundamental limitations on
the classes of structures that can be studied. Here, we develop a theoretical
framework for assessing a photonic structure's topology directly from its
effective Hamiltonian and position operators, as expressed in real space, and
without the need to calculate the system's Bloch eigenstates or band structure.
Using this framework, we show that non-trivial topology, and associated
boundary-localized chiral resonances, can manifest in photonic crystals with
broken time-reversal symmetry that lack a complete band gap, a result which may
have implications for new topological laser designs. Finally, we use our
operator-based framework to develop a novel class of invariants for topology
stemming from a system's crystalline symmetries, which allows for the
prediction of robust localized states for creating waveguides and cavities.

column density probability distribution functions (PDFs) show power-law tails
extending to high column densities. The distributions of sonic Mach number,
$M_S$ are sharply peaked at $M_S \sim 5 - 8$ for 3 GMCs; a fourth has a broad

Jupiter-mass planets in low-eccentric orbits resembling the Earth-Mars-Jupiter
configuration in the Solar system, as well as the close-in warm Neptune with a
mass of ~14 Earth masses. Here, we constrain this early solution with the
outermost period to be accurate to one month. The best-fit Newtonian model is
characterized by moderate eccentricities of the most massive planets below 0.1

2e:1b mean motion resonance of the Saturn-Jupiter-like pair, but may be close
to weak three-body MMRs. The system appears rigorously stable over a wide
region of parameter space covering uncertainties of several $\sigma$. The
system stability is robust to a five-fold increase in the minimal masses,
consistent with a wide range of inclinations, from 20 to 90 deg. This means
that all planetary masses are safely below the brown dwarf mass limit. We found
a weak statistical indication of the likely system inclination I~20-30 deg.

points $\{z_{n,k} = \psi^*(e^{i(2k+1)\pi/(n+1)})\}$ agree with the Chebyshev
points and that the Chebyshev points are most commonly used as nodes for
Lagrange polynomial interpolation. On the other hand, numerical experimentation
demonstrates that for a typical open $L$-shape arc $\Gamma$, the Lebesgue
constants tend to $\infty$ at the rate of $O((log(n))^2)$, as the polynomial
degree $n$ increases, while the $A_{p}$-weight conditions for the Fej\'er
points $\{z_{n,k}\}$ do not carry over from [-1, 1] to a truly $L$-shape arc.
Further numerical experiments also demonstrate that the least upper bounds of
the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequalities for the canonical Lagrange interpolation
polynomials at $\{z_{n,k}\}$ seem to grow at the rate of $n^{\beta}$, for some
$\beta >0$ that depends on $p >1$.

consecutive frames, is often dependent on model architectures with a large
number of features, preventing their deployment on systems with limited

design for frame interpolation that leverages model pruning through
sparsity-inducing optimization to greatly reduce the model size while attaining
higher performance. Concretely, we begin by compressing the recently proposed
AdaCoF model and demonstrating that a 10 times compressed AdaCoF performs
similarly to its original counterpart, where different strategies for using
layerwise sparsity information as a guide are comprehensively investigated
under a variety of hyperparameter settings. We then enhance this compressed
model by introducing a multi-resolution warping module, which improves visual
consistency with multi-level details. As a result, we achieve a considerable
performance gain with a quarter of the size of the original AdaCoF. In
addition, our model performs favorably against other state-of-the-art
approaches on a wide variety of datasets. We note that the suggested
compression-driven framework is generic and can be easily transferred to other
DNN-based frame interpolation algorithms. The source code is available at

Physical attacks on sensors such as sensor tampering or spoofing can feed

consider a strong form of physical attack called sensor deception attacks
(SDAs), in which the adversary targets multiple sensors of different types
simultaneously (even including all sensors). Under SDAs, DeLorean inspects the

erroneous sensor inputs from being used in RV's feedback control loop. DeLorean
replays historic state information in the feedback control loop and recovers
the RV from attacks. Our evaluation on four real and two simulated RVs shows

common strategy and, specifically, making use of hybrid structures, can produce
synergistic effects that lead to highly active catalysts. Here, we present a
core-shell catalyst of Ag@MoS$_2$ that shows promising results towards the
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.5 M KOH. In this

We suggest that the enhancement of alkaline HER is associated with a
cooperative effect of the interfaces, where the Ag(I) sites in Ag$_2$S drive
the water dissociation step, and the formed hydrogen subsequently recombines on
the defective MoS$_2$ shell. This study demonstrates the benefits of hybrid

on the inverse probability weighting (IPW), which becomes unstable when the
probability weights are close to zero and cannot incorporate auxiliary
information. First, we consider capture-recapture sampling, which combines an
initial uniform sampling with a second Poisson sampling. Under this sampling
plan, we propose an empirical likelihood weighting (ELW) estimation approach to
an M-estimation parameter. Second, based on the ELW method, we construct a
nearly optimal capture-recapture sampling plan that balances estimation
efficiency and computational costs. Third, we derive methods for determining
the smallest sample sizes with which the proposed sampling-and-estimation

the instability of IPW by circumventing the use of inverse probabilities, and
utilizes auxiliary information including the size and certain sample moments of
big data. We show that the proposed ELW method produces more efficient
estimators than IPW, leading to more efficient optimal sampling plans and more
economical sample sizes for a prespecified estimation precision. These
advantages are confirmed through simulation studies and real data analyses.

multi-dimensional tailoring. Here we introduce the use of an ultrathin
polarisation-beam-splitting metalens for the arbitrary structuring of quantum

polarisation and phase control at a single meta-atom level, the designed
metalens enables simultaneous imaging of quantum emission from ultra-bright
defects in hexagonal boron nitride and imprinting of an arbitrary wavefront
onto orthogonal polarisation states of the sources. The hybrid quantum metalens
enables simultaneous manipulation of multiple degrees of freedom of a quantum
light source, including directionality, polarisation, and orbital angular

multiple degrees of freedom could unleash the full potential of solid-state
SPEs for their use as high-dimensional quantum sources for advanced quantum

buckling. Fluid absorption and storage eventually cause the material to locally
swell. Different parts can hydrate and swell unevenly, prompting a differential
expansion of the surface. In order to computationally study the hydraulically
induced differential swelling and buckling of such a membrane, we develop a
network model that describes both the membrane shape and fluid movement,
coupling mechanics with hydrodynamics. We simulate the time-dependent fluid
distribution in the flow network based on a spatially explicit resistor network
model with local fluid-storage capacitance. The shape of the surface is modeled
by a spring network produced by a tethered mesh discretization, in which local
bond rest lengths are adjusted instantaneously according to associated local
fluid content in the capacitors in a quasi-static way. We investigate the
effects of various designs of the flow network, including overall hydraulic
traits (resistance and capacitance) and hierarchical architecture (arrangement
of major and minor veins), on the specific dynamics of membrane shape
transformation. To quantify these effects, we explore the correlation between
local Gaussian curvature and relative stored fluid content in each hierarchy by
using linear regression, which reveals that stronger correlations could be
induced by less densely connected major veins. This flow-controlled mechanism
of shape transformation was inspired by the blooming of flowers through the
unfolding of petals. It can potentially offer insights for other reversible
motions observed in plants induced by differential turgor and water transport
through the xylem vessels, as well as engineering applications.

dynamic hallmarks of equilibrium gel formation and establish that the

re-entrant network formation without phase separation as a function of linker

nanoparticle surface bonding sites. Departures from stoichiometry result in
linker-starved or site-starved networks with reduced connectivity and shorter

compute and decompose the noncovalent interaction energy between two molecular
fragments A and B connected via a linker C. The existing ISAPT algorithm
displays several issues for many fragmentation patterns, including an
artificially repulsive electrostatic energy (even when the fragments are
hydrogen-bonded) and very large and mutually cancelling induction and
exchange-induction terms. We attribute those issues to the artificial dipole
moments at the interfragment boundary, as the atoms of A and B directly
connected to C are missing electrons on one of their hybrid orbitals.
Therefore, we propose several new partitioning algorithms which reassign one
electron, on a singly occupied link hybrid orbital, from C to each of A/B. Once
the contributions from these link orbitals are added to fragment density
matrices, the computation of ISAPT electrostatic, induction, and dispersion
energies proceeds exactly as normal, and the exchange energy expressions need
only minor modifications. Among the link partitioning algorithms introduced,
the ISAPT(SIAO1) approach (in which the link orbital is obtained by a
projection onto the intrinsic atomic orbitals of a given fragment followed by
orthogonalization to this fragment's occupied space) leads to reasonable values
of all ISAPT corrections for all fragmentation patterns and exhibits fast and
systematic basis set convergence. This improvement is made possible by a
significant reduction in magnitude (even though not a complete elimination) of
the unphysical dipole moments at the interfragment boundaries. We demonstrate
the utility of the improved ISAPT partitioning by examining intramolecular
interactions in several pentanediol isomers, examples of linear and branched
alkanes, and the open and closed conformations of a family of N-arylimide

commonly done via quadrupole scans, are typically slow. Such calculations are a
type of $\textit{multi-point query}$, i.e. each query requires multiple
secondary measurements. Traditional black-box optimizers such as Bayesian
optimization are slow and inefficient when dealing with such objectives as they
must acquire the full series of measurements, but return only the emittance,
with each query. We propose applying Bayesian Algorithm Execution (BAX) to
instead query and model individual beam-size measurements. BAX avoids the slow
multi-point query on the accelerator by acquiring points through a
$\textit{virtual objective}$, i.e. calculating the emittance objective from a
fast learned model rather than directly from the accelerator. Here, we use BAX
to minimize emittance at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and the
Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests II (FACET-II). In
simulation, BAX is 20$\times$ faster and more robust to noise compared to
existing methods. In live LCLS and FACET-II tests, BAX performed the first
automated emittance tuning, matching the hand-tuned emittance at FACET-II and
achieving a 24% lower emittance at LCLS. Our method represents a conceptual

propose to mitigate the popularity bias by considering multiple user behaviors.
  In this work, we examine causal relationships behind the interaction
generation procedure in multi-behavior recommendation. Specifically, we find
that: 1) item popularity is a confounder between the exposed items and users'
post-click interactions, leading to the first unfairness; and 2) some hidden
confounders (e.g., the reputation of item producers) affect both item
popularity and quality, resulting in the second unfairness. To alleviate these
confounding issues, we propose a causal framework to estimate the causal
effect, which leverages backdoor adjustment to block the backdoor paths caused
by the confounders. In the inference stage, we remove the negative effect of
popularity and utilize the good effect of quality for recommendation.
Experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our
proposed framework, which enhances fairness without sacrificing recommendation
accuracy.

entangled spins commonly arising from frustrated magnetic dipolar interactions.
However, QSL in some pyrochlore magnets can also come from frustrated magnetic
octupolar interactions. Although the key signature for both dipolar and
octupolar interaction-driven QSL is the presence of a spin excitation continuum
(spinons) arising from the spin quantum number fractionalization, an external
magnetic field-induced ferromagnetic order will transform the spinons into
conventional spin waves in a dipolar QSL. By contrast, in an octupole QSL, the
spin waves carry octupole moments that do not couple, in the leading order, to
the external magnetic field or to neutron moments but will contribute to the
field dependence of the heat capacity. Here we use neutron scattering to show
that the application of a large external magnetic field to Ce2Zr2O7, an
octupolar QSL candidate, induces an Anderson-Higgs transition by condensing the
spinons into a static ferromagnetic ordered state with octupolar spin waves
invisible to neutrons but contributing to the heat capacity. Our theoretical
calculations also provide a microscopic, qualitative understanding for the
presence of octupole scattering at large wavevectors in Ce2Sn2O7 pyrochlore,
and its absence in Ce2Zr2O7. Therefore, our results identify Ce2Zr2O7 as a
strong candidate for an octupolar U (1) QSL, establishing that frustrated
magnetic octupolar interactions are responsible for QSL properties in Ce-based
pyrochlore magnets.

cross-representation alignment utilizing the complementary information from the

errors between initial mesh estimation and both 2D representations are
forwarded into regressor and dynamically corrected in the following mesh
regression. This adaptive cross-representation alignment explicitly learns from
the deviations and captures complementary information: robustness from sparse

experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets and demonstrate competitive
results, helping take a step towards reducing the annotation effort needed to

that accounts controlled by the same Sybil may produce similar DApp activities

First, we develop a synthesis method that simultaneously creates a barrier

controller guarantees the invariance of the barrier function under the
uncertain dynamics and disturbances of the system. Then, we build an
identifier-based estimator that provides a state estimate affine to the

privacy, especially for cryptosystems. In this paper, we propose CaType, a
novel refinement type-based tool for detecting cache side channels in crypto
software. Compared to previous works, CaType provides the following advantages:
(1) For the first time CaType analyzes cache side channels using refinement
type over x86 assembly code. It reveals several significant and effective
enhancements with refined types, including bit-level granularity tracking,
distinguishing different effects of variables, precise type inferences, and
high scalability. (2) CaType is the first static analyzer for crypto libraries
in consideration of blinding-based defenses. (3) From the perspective of
implementation, CaType uses cache layouts of potential vulnerable control-flow
branches rather than cache states to suppress false positives. We evaluate
CaType in identifying side channel vulnerabilities in real-world crypto
software, including RSA, ElGamal, and (EC)DSA from OpenSSL and Libgcrypt.
CaType captures all known defects, detects previously-unknown vulnerabilities,
and reveals several false positives of previous tools. In terms of performance,
CaType is 16X faster than CacheD and 131X faster than CacheS when analyzing the
same libraries. These evaluation results confirm the capability of CaType in
identifying side channel defects with great precision, efficiency, and
scalability.

includes both tunnelling transport, as well as metallic transport. Using the
spin accumulation computed either side of a tunnel barrier, spin torques are
obtained, and it is shown the model reproduces both damping-like and field-like
spin-transfer torques, with the expected sinusoidal angular dependence, and
inverse ferromagnetic layer thickness dependence. An explicit solution to the
drift-diffusion model is derived, which allows analysing the effect of both the
reference and free layer thickness on the spin-transfer torque polarization and
field-like coefficient. In particular, when the layers are thin, additional
spin-dependent scattering contributions due to incomplete absorption of
transverse spin components reduce both the damping-like and field-like spin
torques. It is shown the model developed here can be used to compute the
signal-to-noise ratio in realistic magnetic read-heads, where spin
torque-induced fluctuations and instabilities limit the maximum operating
voltage. The effect of metallic pinhole defects in the insulator layer is also
analysed, which results in a mixture of metallic and tunnelling transport, and
highly non-uniform charge and spin currents, requiring the full spin transport
model to compute the resulting magneto-resistance and spin torques. Increasing
the area covered by pinholes results in a rapid degradation of the
magneto-resistance, following an inverse dependence. Moreover, the spin torque
angular dependence becomes skewed, and the spin-transfer torque polarization
decreases. The same results are obtained when considering tunnel junctions with
a single pinhole defect, but decreasing cross-sectional area, showing that even
a single pinhole defect can significantly degrade the performance of tunnel
junctions and magnetic read-heads below the 40 nm node.

decentralized resource allocation operating at a competitive equilibrium over a
finite horizon. The utility of resource consumption, along with the income from
resource exchange, forms each agent's payoff which is aimed to be maximized.
Each utility function is parameterized by individual preferences which can be
designed by agents independently. By shaping these preferences and proposing a
set of utility functions, we can guarantee that the optimal resource price at
the competitive equilibrium always remains socially acceptable, i.e., it never
violates a given threshold that indicates affordability. First, we show this
problem is solvable at the conceptual level under some convexity assumptions.
Then, as a benchmark case, we consider quadratic MAS and formulate the
associated social shaping problem as a multi-agent LQR problem which enables us
to propose explicit utility sets using quadratic programming and dynamic
programming. Finally, a numerical algorithm is presented for calculating the
range of the preference function parameters which guarantee a socially accepted
price. Some illustrative examples are given to examine the effectiveness of the

Action-Complexity conjectures. According to this family of proposals, geometric
quantities can be defined in some holographic gravitational theories that can
be mapped with the concept of quantum complexity for states in a dual
quantum-mechanical theory.
  In this work, we review the original motivations for the use of
quantum-information theory in the search of a theory of quantum gravity, and
argue in favour of holographic complexity as a promising new tool that could
play a key role in the elucidation of the properties of black holes.
  After this introduction, we devote some time to the study of `exotic'
thermodynamical systems of diverse origin, confronting the conjectures with
expectations and seeking for new behaviours of holographic complexity that
could help us understand or refine the existing proposals.
  Next, we turn our attention to the study of holographic complexity for
singular spacetimes, defining slightly modified versions of the conjecture that
are well adapted to singularities and searching for universal behaviours of
complexity dynamics within these setups.
  Finally, we finish with some speculations about the relation between
holographic complexity and older characterization criteria for singularities in
general relativity.

exclusion process which involves totally asymmetric transport process of two
oppositely directed species with stochastic directional switching of the
species on a 1D lattice. As a function of $Q$ - the ratio of the translation
rate and directional switching rate of particles, in the limit of $Q
\rightarrow 0$, the probability distribution of the cluster size is an
exponentially decaying function of cluster size $m$ and is exactly similar to
the cluster size distribution of a TASEP. For $Q>>1$, the model can be mapped
to persistent exclusion process (PEP) and the average cluster size, $\langle m
\rangle \propto Q^{1/2} $. We obtain an approximate expression for the average
cluster size in this limit. For finite system size system of $L$ lattice sites,
for a particle number density $\rho$, the probability distribution of cluster
sizes exhibits a distinct peak which corresponds to the formation of a single
cluster of size $m_s = \rho L$. However this peak vanishes in the thermodynamic
limit $ L \rightarrow \infty$. Interestingly, the probability of this largest
size cluster, $P(m_s)$, exhibits scaling behaviour such that in terms of scaled
variable $Q_1 \equiv Q/L^2 \rho(1-\rho)$, data collapse is observed for the
probability of this cluster. The statistical features related to clustering
observed for this minimal model may also be relevant for understanding
clustering characteristics in {\it active } particles systems in confined 1D

more brain cells stop working partially or at all. Diagnosis of this disorder
in the early phases of the disease is a vital task to rescue patients lives
from bad consequences and provide them with better healthcare. Machine learning
methods have been proven to be accurate in predicting dementia in the early
phases of the disease. The prediction of dementia depends heavily on the type
of collected data which usually are gathered from Normalized Whole Brain Volume
(nWBV) and Atlas Scaling Factor (ASF) which are normally measured and corrected
from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs). Other biological features such as age
and gender can also help in the diagnosis of dementia. Although many studies
use machine learning for predicting dementia, we could not reach a conclusion
on the stability of these methods for which one is more accurate under
different experimental conditions. Therefore, this paper investigates the
conclusion stability regarding the performance of machine learning algorithms
for dementia prediction. To accomplish this, a large number of experiments were
run using 7 machine learning algorithms and two feature reduction algorithms
namely, Information Gain (IG) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To
examine the stability of these algorithms, thresholds of feature selection were
changed for the IG from 20% to 100% and the PCA dimension from 2 to 8. This has
resulted in 7x9 + 7x7= 112 experiments. In each experiment, various
classification evaluation data were recorded. The obtained results show that
among seven algorithms the support vector machine and Naive Bayes are the most
stable algorithms while changing the selection threshold. Also, it was found
that using IG would seem more efficient than using PCA for predicting Dementia.

atmospheric stellar parameters. Since KIC 6951642 was reported to belong to a
spectroscopic binary system, we fitted the time delays derived from the light
curves with the radial velocities obtained from published as well as new
spectra in an attempt to improve the quality of the first orbit. Follow-up
spectroscopy showed that KIC 6951642 is a fast-rotating F0-type star in a
possible single-lined binary with a period of $\sim$4.8 yr. In the
low-frequency regime, we identified the frequencies of 0.721 d$^{-1}$ as well
as of 0.0087 d$^{-1}$. We attribute the first frequency to stellar rotation and
the second one to stellar activity with a cycle. We also detected $g$ modes,
with the strongest mode located at 2.238 d$^{-1}$, as well as three asymmetric
multiplets (with a mean spacing of 0.675$\pm$0.044 d$^{-1}$). In the
high-frequency regime, we detected frequencies of type-$\delta$ Scuti, with the
strongest mode located at 13.96 d$^{-1}$, as well as seven asymmetric
multiplets (with a mean spacing of 0.665$\pm$0.084 d$^{-1}$). We subsequently
identified a few more frequencies that appear to be combinations of a $g$ or
$p$ mode and one of the higher cited frequencies not due to pulsations. We
propose that KIC 6951642 accommodates for a fast-rotating $\gamma$ Dor-$\delta$
Sct hybrid star with various rotationally split multiplets of $g$ and $p$ modes
and that it also displays a cycle lasting years of (possible) stellar activity.

ground set, where each element has a cost and a non-negative profit, along with
a matroid over the elements and a budget. The goal is to select a subset of
elements which maximizes the total profit subject to the matroid and budget
constraints. Several well known special cases, where we have, e.g., a uniform
matroid and a budget, or no matroid constraint (i.e., the classic knapsack
problem), admit a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS). In
contrast, already a slight generalization to the multi-budgeted matroid
independent set problem has a PTAS but does not admit an efficient
polynomial-time approximation scheme (EPTAS). This implies a PTAS for our
problem, which is the best known result prior to this work. Our main
contribution is an EPTAS for the budgeted matroid independent set problem. A
key idea of the scheme is to find a representative set for the instance, whose
cardinality depends solely on $1/\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon > 0$ is the
accuracy parameter of the scheme. The representative set is identified via
matroid basis minimization, which can be solved by a simple greedy algorithm.
Our scheme enumerates over subsets of the representative set and extends each
subset using a linear program. The notion of representative sets may be useful
in solving other variants of the budgeted matroid independent set problem.

Closed-source models are the current standard for most policy and industry
decisions. However, open models have proven to be competitive alternatives that
promote science, robust technical analysis, collaboration and transparent
policy decision-making. Yet, two issues slow the adoption: open models are
often designed with limited geographic scope, hindering synergies from
collaboration, or are based on low spatially resolved data, limiting their use.
Here we introduce PyPSA-Earth, the first open-source global energy system model
with data in high spatial and temporal resolution. It enables large-scale
collaboration by providing a tool that can model the world energy system or any
subset of it. This work is derived from the European PyPSA-Eur model using new
data and functions. It is suitable for operational as well as combined
generation, storage and transmission expansion studies. The model provides two
main features: (1) customizable data extraction and preparation scripts with
global coverage and (2) a PyPSA energy modelling framework integration. The
data includes electricity demand, generation and medium to high-voltage
networks from open sources, yet additional data can be further integrated. A
broad range of clustering and grid meshing strategies help adapt the model to
computational and practical needs. A data validation for the entire African
continent is performed and the optimization features are tested with a 2060
net-zero planning study for Nigeria. The demonstration shows that the presented
developments can build a highly detailed energy system model for energy
planning studies to support policy and technical decision-making. We welcome
joining forces to address the challenges of the energy transition together.

Universe's past evolution. Specifically we point out that a pressure
singularity that occurred in our Universe's past might have left its imprint on
Earth's geological and climatological history and on the shadows of
cosmological black holes. Our approach is based on the fact that the $H_0$
tension problem may be resolved if some sort of abrupt physics change occurred
in our Universe $70-150\,$Myrs ago, an abrupt change that deeply affected the
Cepheid parameters. We review how such an abrupt physics change might have been
caused in our Universe by a smooth passage of it through a pressure finite-time
singularity. Such finite-time singularities might occur in modified gravity and
specifically in $F(R)$ gravity, so we show how modified gravity might drive
this type of evolution, without resorting to peculiar cosmic fluids or scalar
fields. The presence of such a pressure singularity can distort the elliptic
trajectories of bound objects in the Universe, causing possible geological and
climatological changes on Earth, if its elliptic trajectory around the Sun
might have changed. Also, such a pressure singularity affects directly the
circular photon orbits around supermassive galactic black holes existing at
cosmological redshift distances, thus the shadows of some cosmological black
holes at redshifts $z\leq 0.01$, might look different in shape, compared with
the SgrA* and M87* supermassive black holes. This feature however can be

for modeling large spatial datasets. It is based on representing a Gaussian
random field $u$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ as the solution of an elliptic SPDE $L^\beta
u = \mathcal{W}$ where $L$ is a second-order differential operator, $2\beta$
(belongs to natural number starting from 1) is a positive parameter that
controls the smoothness of $u$ and $\mathcal{W}$ is Gaussian white noise. A few
approaches have been suggested in the literature to extend the approach to
allow for any smoothness parameter satisfying $\beta>d/4$. Even though those
approaches work well for simulating SPDEs with general smoothness, they are
less suitable for Bayesian inference since they do not provide approximations
which are Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) as in the original SPDE
approach. We address this issue by proposing a new method based on
approximating the covariance operator $L^{-2\beta}$ of the Gaussian field $u$
by a finite element method combined with a rational approximation of the
fractional power. This results in a numerically stable GMRF approximation which
can be combined with the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) method
for fast Bayesian inference. A rigorous convergence analysis of the method is
performed and the accuracy of the method is investigated with simulated data.
Finally, we illustrate the approach and corresponding implementation in the R

combining the rSPDE package with the R-INLA software for full Bayesian

questions as varied as neutrino masses, the hierarchy problem, and the
Universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry. Because dark sectors are generically
weakly coupled to ordinary matter, and because they can naturally have
MeV-to-GeV masses and respect the symmetries of the SM, they are only mildly
constrained by high-energy collider data and precision atomic measurements. Yet
upcoming and proposed intensity-frontier experiments will offer an
unprecedented window into the physics of dark sectors, highlighted as a
Priority Research Direction in the 2018 Dark Matter New Initiatives (DMNI) BRN
report. Support for this program -- in the form of dark-sector analyses at
multi-purpose experiments, realization of the intensity-frontier experiments
receiving DMNI funds, an expansion of DMNI support to explore the full breadth
of DM and visible final-state signatures (especially long-lived particles)
called for in the BRN report, and support for a robust dark-sector theory
effort -- will enable comprehensive exploration of low-mass thermal DM
milestones, and greatly enhance the potential of intensity-frontier experiments
to discover dark-sector particles decaying back to SM particles.

knowledge through binary interactions with others; their increase is modulated
by the interaction and learning rate: Agents with similar knowledge learn more
in encounters, while agents with very different levels benefit less from
learning interactions. The optimal fraction of time spent on learning is
calculated by a Bellman equation, resulting in a highly nonlinear

analyze various gradient-encoding strategies through the weight functions and
waveform configurations over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).
We show that specific weight functions that enable absentee EDs (i.e.,
hard-coded participation with absentees (HPA)) or weighted votes (i.e.,
soft-coded participation (SP)) can substantially reduce the probability of
detecting the incorrect MV. By taking path loss, power control, cell size, and
fading channel into account, we prove the convergence of the distributed
learning for a non-convex function for HPA. Through simulations, we show that
the proposed scheme with HPA and SP can provide high test accuracy even when
the time-synchronization and the power control are not ideal under
heterogeneous data distribution scenarios.

Using an automated pipeline of diachronic distributional semantic embedding

Experiment results on COCO, Pascal VOC, and Wider Face/Pedestrian confirmed the
efficacy by achieving on par or higher scores in joint training compared to
training separately. Moreover, we pre-train on more than 20 million images with
4 million unique object vocabulary, and the resulting model is evaluated on 35

for the calculation of optical spectra of stacked periodic nanostructures in

input and output vectors as well as background scattering matrices of two
subsystems, one can easily calculate those for the combined system comprising
two subsystems. It allows us to write a resonant approximation for the combined
system and speed up calculation significantly for typical calculation problems.
The main drawback of this approach is that the background matrix in such
approximation was considered constant which is not always sufficient if the
energy range of interest is relatively wide. The aim of this article is to
solve this problem by utilizing more complicated approximations for the
background matrices. In particular, we show that consideration of
energy-dependent correction terms for the background matrices remarkably
reduces the resonant energies' calculation error. Here we first consider a
linear approximation, and although it is not suitable for large energy ranges,
it is used as a base for a piecewise-linear approximation which allows one to
keep the approximation error negligibly small with only a few sample points.
Moreover, interpolation of the background matrices allows one to apply resonant
mode coupling approximation in almost arbitrary large energy ranges. We also
consider approximation of background matrices by an arbitrary matrix function
and propose a technique to derive the resonant poles in this case. The methods
described here could be considered as an alternative approach for calculation
of optical spectra stacked systems.

ill-posed in the sense of Hadamard, i.e. a small change in $u(x,T)$ leads to
large changes in the initial data. Nevertheless, we will show that if we
consider sufficiently smooth current information, then the solution exists and
it is unique and stable. It will also be shown that if $\beta=1$, then the
corresponding non-local problem is well-posed and coercive type inequalities
are valid.

  overlap with arXiv:2111.15430",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Despite the undeniable progress in visual recognition tasks fueled by deep
neural networks, there exists recent evidence showing that these models are
poorly calibrated, resulting in over-confident predictions. The standard
practices of minimizing the cross entropy loss during training promote the
predicted softmax probabilities to match the one-hot label assignments.
Nevertheless, this yields a pre-softmax activation of the correct class that is
significantly larger than the remaining activations, which exacerbates the
miscalibration problem. Recent observations from the classification literature
suggest that loss functions that embed implicit or explicit maximization of the
entropy of predictions yield state-of-the-art calibration performances. Despite
these findings, the impact of these losses in the relevant task of calibrating
medical image segmentation networks remains unexplored. In this work, we
provide a unifying constrained-optimization perspective of current
state-of-the-art calibration losses. Specifically, these losses could be viewed
as approximations of a linear penalty (or a Lagrangian term) imposing equality
constraints on logit distances. This points to an important limitation of such
underlying equality constraints, whose ensuing gradients constantly push
towards a non-informative solution, which might prevent from reaching the best
compromise between the discriminative performance and calibration of the model
during gradient-based optimization. Following our observations, we propose a
simple and flexible generalization based on inequality constraints, which
imposes a controllable margin on logit distances. Comprehensive experiments on
a variety of public medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our
method sets novel state-of-the-art results on these tasks in terms of network
calibration, whereas the discriminative performance is also improved.

addition, the interplay between solidification and convection can be studied by
characterizing convection plumes in the fluid, and solute concentrations above

This is demonstrated by applying the code to several dynamic in situ X-ray

  Communication Networks",,,,,"cs.NI eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As a core performance metric for green communications, the conventional
energy efficiency definition has successfully resolved many issues in the
energy efficient wireless network design. In the past several generations of
wireless communication networks, the traditional energy efficiency measure
plays an important role to guide many energy saving techniques for slow varying
traffic profiles. However, for the next generation wireless networks, the
traditional energy efficiency fails to capture the traffic and capacity
variations of wireless networks in temporal or spatial domains, which is shown
to be quite popular, especially with ultra-scale multiple antennas and
space-air-ground integrated network. In this paper, we present a novel energy
efficiency metric named integrated relative energy efficiency (IREE), which is
able to jointly measure the traffic profiles and the network capacities from
the energy efficiency perspective. On top of that, the IREE based green
trade-offs have been investigated and compared with the conventional energy
efficient design. Moreover, we apply the IREE based green trade-offs to
evaluate several candidate technologies for 6G networks, including
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces and space-air-ground integrated network.
Through some analytical and numerical results, we show that the proposed IREE
metric is able to capture the wireless traffic and capacity mismatch property,
which is significantly different from the conventional energy efficiency
metric. Since the IREE oriented design or deployment strategy is able to
consider the network capacity improvement and the wireless traffic matching
simultaneously, it can be regarded as a useful guidance for future energy
efficient network design.

in troubleshooting, its storage requirement can be significantly reduced by
biasing the selection towards anomalous traces. To aid in this scenario, we

traces in an unsupervised manner. SampleHST adjusts the storage quota of normal
and anomalous traces depending on the size of its budget. Initially, it
utilizes a forest of Half Space Trees (HSTs) for trace scoring. This is based
on the distribution of the mass scores across the trees, which characterizes
the probability of observing different traces. The mass distribution from HSTs
is subsequently used to cluster the traces online leveraging a variant of the
mean-shift algorithm. This trace-cluster association eventually drives the
sampling decision. We have compared the performance of SampleHST with a
recently suggested method using data from a cloud data center and demonstrated
that SampleHST improves sampling performance up to by 9.5x.

exploiting more sophisticated strategies using measures of node relatedness
(heatmaps, or simply distance) within these algorithmic components can
significantly enhance performance. However, contrary to initial expectations,
we also observed that heatmaps did not present significant advantages over
simpler distance measures for these purposes. Therefore, we faced a common --

performance on an important optimization task, but an ablation analysis
demonstrated that simpler alternatives perform equally well.
