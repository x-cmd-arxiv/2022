discrepancy between direct measurements -- via instruments measuring ""bare"" sky
from which Zodiacal and Galactic light models are subtracted -- and
measurements of the Integrated Galaxy Light (IGL). This discrepancy could lie
in either method, whether it be an incomplete Zodiacal model or missed faint
galaxies in the IGL calculations. It has been proposed that the discrepancy is
due to deep galaxy surveys, such as those with the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST), missing up to half of the faint galaxies with $24 \le m_{AB} \le 29$
mag. We address this possibility by simulating higher number densities of
galaxies, and so assess incompleteness due to object overlap, with three
replications of the Hubble UltraDeep Field (HUDF). SourceExtractor is used to
compare the recovered counts and photometry to the original HUDF, allowing us
to assess how many galaxies may have been missed due to confusion, i.e., due to
blending with neighboring faint galaxies. This exercise reveals that, while up
to 50% of faint galaxies with $28 \le m_{AB} \le 29$ mag were missed or blended
with neighboring objects in certain filters, not enough were missed to account
for the EBL discrepancy alone in any of the replications.

tackle this problem, we synthesize specifically-designed occluded videos for
training fall detection systems using existing datasets. Then, by defining a
new cost function, we introduce a framework for weighted training of fall
detection models using occluded and un-occluded videos, which can be applied to
any learnable fall detection system. Finally, we use both a non-deep and deep
model to evaluate the effect of the proposed weighted training method.
Experiments show that the proposed method can improve the classification
accuracy by 36% for a non-deep model and 55% for a deep model in occlusion
conditions. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed training framework can also
significantly improve the detection performance of a deep network on normal

particles (ALPs) in our Galaxy induces oscillating couplings to the spins of
nucleons and nuclei (via the electric dipole moment of the latter and/or the
paramagnetic axion-wind effect), we establish the feasibility of a new method
to search for ALPs in storage rings. Based on previous work that allows us to
maintain the in-plane polarization of a stored deuteron beam for a few hundred
seconds, we performed a first proof-of-principle experiment at the Cooler
Synchrotron COSY to scan momenta near 970 MeV/c. This entailed a scan of the
spin precession frequency. At resonance between the spin precession frequency
of deuterons and the ALP-induced EDM oscillation frequency there will be an
accumulation of the polarization component out of the ring plane. Since the
axion frequency is unknown, the momentum of the beam and consequently the spin
precession frequency were ramped to search for a vertical polarization change
that would occur when the resonance is crossed. At COSY, four beam bunches with
different polarization directions were used to make sure that no resonance was
missed because of the unknown relative phase between the polarization
precession and the axion/ALP field. A frequency window of 1.5-kHz width around
the spin precession frequency of 121 kHz was scanned. We describe the
experimental procedure and a test of the methodology with the help of a
radiofrequency Wien filter located on the COSY ring. No ALP resonance was
observed. As a consequence an upper limit of the oscillating EDM component of
the deuteron as well as its axion coupling constants are provided.

via dephasing -- i.e., destructive interference of spins precessing about the

$\approx$1 nm in typical ferromagnetic thin films, it is difficult to
distinguish dephasing in the bulk from spin-flip scattering at the interface.
Here, to assess which mechanism dominates, we examine transverse spin-current
absorption in ferromagnetic NiCu alloy films with reduced exchange fields. We
observe that the coherence length increases with decreasing Curie temperature,
as weaker dephasing in the film bulk slows down spin absorption. Moreover,
nonmagnetic Cu impurities do not diminish the efficiency of spin-transfer
torque from the absorbed spin current. Our findings affirm that transverse spin
current is predominantly absorbed by dephasing inside the nanometer-thick
ferromagnetic metals, even with high impurity contents.

fully understood. Here, we show that a linear response theory with a
nonperturbative treatment of spin-dependent interactions and impurity
scattering potential predicts damping-like SOTs that are strictly absent in
perturbative approaches. The technique is applied to a two-dimensional
Rashba-coupled ferromagnet (the paradigmatic model of a NM/FM interface), where
higher-order scattering processes encoding skew scattering from nonmagnetic
impurities allow for current-induced spin polarization with nonzero components
along all spatial directions. This is in stark contrast to previous results of
perturbative methods (neglecting skew scattering), which predict a coplanar
spin-polarization locked perpendicular to the charge current as a result of
conventional Rashba-Edelstein effect. Furthermore, the angular dependence of
ensuing SOTs and their dependence upon the scattering potential strength is
analysed numerically. Simple analytic expressions for the
spin-density--charge-current response function, and related SOT efficiencies,
are obtained in the weak scattering limit. We find that the extrinsic
damping-like torques driven by impurity scattering reaches efficiencies of up
to 7% of the field-like (Rashba-Edelstein) torque. Our microscopic theory shows
that bulk phenomena, such as the spin Hall effect, are not a necessity in the
generation of the damping-like SOTs of the type observed in experiments on
ultra-thin systems.

leverages the ability of transformers to learn a richer mixing function for

the fact that they are models of semantic similarity. In contrast, we develop
evaluation metrics based on Natural Language Inference (NLI), which we deem a
more appropriate modeling. We design a preference-based adversarial attack
framework and show that our NLI based metrics are much more robust to the
attacks than the recent BERT-based metrics. On standard benchmarks, our NLI
based metrics outperform existing summarization metrics, but perform below SOTA
MT metrics. However, when combining existing metrics with our NLI metrics, we
obtain both higher adversarial robustness (15%-30%) and higher quality metrics
as measured on standard benchmarks (+5% to 30%).

on a single-scale of WSIs (e.g., 20x magnification), while human pathologists
usually aggregate the global and local patterns in a multi-scale manner (e.g.,
by zooming in and out between different magnifications). In this study, we
propose a novel cross-scale attention mechanism to explicitly aggregate
inter-scale interactions into a single MIL network for Crohn's Disease (CD),

is two-fold: (1) a cross-scale attention mechanism is proposed to aggregate

differential multi-scale attention visualizations are generated to localize
explainable lesion patterns. By training ~250,000 H&E-stained Ascending Colon

predict. Understanding the causal effect of these predictions on the eventual
outcomes is crucial for foreseeing the implications of future predictive models
and selecting which models to deploy. However, this causal estimation task
poses unique challenges: model predictions are usually deterministic functions
of input features and highly correlated with outcomes. This can make the causal
effects of predictions on outcomes impossible to disentangle from the direct
effect of the covariates. We study this problem through the lens of causal
identifiability, and despite the hardness of this problem in full generality,
we highlight three natural scenarios where the causal relationship between
covariates, predictions and outcomes can be identified from observational data:
randomization in predictions, overparameterization of the predictive model
deployed during data collection, and discrete prediction outputs. Empirically
we show that given our identifiability conditions hold, standard variants of
supervised learning that predict from predictions by treating the prediction as
an input feature can indeed find transferable functional relationships that
allow for conclusions about newly deployed predictive models. These positive
results fundamentally rely on model predictions being recorded during data
collection, bringing forward the importance of rethinking standard data
collection practices to enable progress towards a better understanding of

for safety-critical systems. Data-driven models leveraging available partially
characterized dynamics have potential to provide reliable systems models in a
typical data-limited scenario for high value complex systems, thereby avoiding
months of expensive expert modeling time. In this work we explore this
middle-ground between expert-modeled and pure data-driven modeling. We present
control-oriented parametric models with varying levels of domain-awareness that
exploit known system structure and prior physics knowledge to create
constrained deep neural dynamical system models. We employ universal
differential equations to construct data-driven blackbox and graybox
representations of the AUV dynamics. In addition, we explore a hybrid
formulation that explicitly models the residual error related to imperfect
graybox models. We compare the prediction performance of the learned models for
different distributions of initial conditions and control inputs to assess
their accuracy, generalization, and suitability for control.

memory for inference. We develop a procedure for Int8 matrix multiplication for
feed-forward and attention projection layers in transformers, which cut the
memory needed for inference by half while retaining full precision performance.
With our method, a 175B parameter 16/32-bit checkpoint can be loaded, converted
to Int8, and used immediately without performance degradation. This is made
possible by understanding and working around properties of highly systematic
emergent features in transformer language models that dominate attention and
transformer predictive performance. To cope with these features, we develop a
two-part quantization procedure, LLM.int8(). We first use vector-wise
quantization with separate normalization constants for each inner product in
the matrix multiplication, to quantize most of the features. However, for the
emergent outliers, we also include a new mixed-precision decomposition scheme,
which isolates the outlier feature dimensions into a 16-bit matrix
multiplication while still more than 99.9% of values are multiplied in 8-bit.
Using LLM.int8(), we show empirically it is possible to perform inference in
LLMs with up to 175B parameters without any performance degradation. This
result makes such models much more accessible, for example making it possible
to use OPT-175B/BLOOM on a single server with consumer GPUs. We open-source our

directions while the central segment passes through the center. Each segment
will travel to its own polarization independent flat fold mirror mounted on a
piezoelectric piston/tip/tilt controller then onto its own commercial 3,000
actuator deformable mirror (DM) that will be employed for extreme wavefront
control. This scheme of seven DMs working in parallel to produce a 21,000
actuator DM is a new ExAO architecture that we named a ""parallel DM,"" in which
the hexpyramid is a key optical component. This significantly surpasses any
current or near future actuator count for any monolithic DM architecture. The
optical system is designed for high-quality wavefront (lambda/10 surface PV)
with no polarization errors and no vignetting. The design and fabrication of
the invar mechanical mounting structure for this complex optical system is

interaction near the entrance window diffuses across multiple pixels by the
time it is collected, and is potentially lost below the imposed noise
threshold. In an effort to understand these subtle but significant effects and
inform the design and requirements of future detectors, we present simulations
of charge diffusion using a variety of detector characteristics and operational
settings, assessing spectral response at a range of X-ray energies. We validate
the simulations by comparing the performance to that of real CCD detectors
tested in the lab and deployed in space, spanning a range of thickness, pixel
size, and other characteristics. The simulations show that while larger pixels,
higher bias voltage, and optimal backside passivation improve performance,
reducing the readout noise has a dominant effect in all cases. We finally show
how high-pixel-aspect-ratio devices present challenges for measuring the
backside passivation performance due to the magnitude of other processes that
degrade spectral response, and present a method for utilizing the simulations
to qualitatively assess this performance. Since compelling science requirements

hydrogels, the relationship between controllable network parameters at the
molecular level to macroscopic quantities that govern damage and failure must
be established. Constitutive models based upon statistical mechanics have used
variants of the freely jointed chain (FJC) model with rigid links. However,
since the free energy state of a polymer chain is dominated by enthalpic bond
distortion effects as the chain approaches its rupture point, bond
extensibility ought to be accounted for if the model is intended to capture
chain rupture. To that end, a new bond potential is supplemented to the FJC
model (as derived in the uFJC framework of Buche and colleagues), which we have
extended to yield a tractable, closed-form model that is amenable to
constitutive model development. Inspired by the asymptotically matched uFJC
model response, a simple, quasi-polynomial, and anharmonic bond potential
energy function is derived. Using this bond potential, approximate yet
highly-accurate analytical functions for bond stretch and chain force dependent
upon chain stretch are established. Then, using this polymer chain model, a
stochastic thermal fluctuation-driven chain rupture framework is developed.
This framework is based upon a force-modified tilted bond potential that
accounts for distortional bond potential energy, allowing for the calculation
of dissipated chain scission energy. The model is fit to single-chain
mechanical response data collected from atomic force microscopy tensile tests
for validation and to glean deeper insight into the molecular physics taking
place. Due to their analytical nature, this polymer chain model and the
associated rupture framework can be straightforwardly implemented in finite
element models accounting for fracture and fatigue in polydisperse elastomer
networks.

model with high Tukey depth from a collection of non-private regression models.
Given $n$ samples of $d$-dimensional data used to train $m$ models, we
construct an efficient analogue using an approximate Tukey depth that runs in
time $O(d^2n + dm\log(m))$. We find that this algorithm obtains strong
empirical performance in the data-rich setting with no data bounds or
hyperparameter selection required.

computing accuracy on a validation set that has labels. In contrast, in an
unsupervised setting, the validation set has no such labels. Without any

accuracy instead. But what is the best approach to estimating accuracy? In this

One widely studied approach is to utilize motion capture (MoCap) data to teach
the humanoid agent low-level skills (e.g., standing, walking, and running) that
can then be re-used to synthesize high-level behaviors. However, even with
MoCap data, controlling simulated humanoids remains very hard, as MoCap data
offers only kinematic information. Finding physical control inputs to realize
the demonstrated motions requires computationally intensive methods like
reinforcement learning. Thus, despite the publicly available MoCap data, its
utility has been limited to institutions with large-scale compute. In this
work, we dramatically lower the barrier for productive research on this topic
by training and releasing high-quality agents that can track over three hours
of MoCap data for a simulated humanoid in the dm_control physics-based
environment. We release MoCapAct (Motion Capture with Actions), a dataset of
these expert agents and their rollouts, which contain proprioceptive
observations and actions. We demonstrate the utility of MoCapAct by using it to
train a single hierarchical policy capable of tracking the entire MoCap dataset
within dm_control and show the learned low-level component can be re-used to
efficiently learn downstream high-level tasks. Finally, we use MoCapAct to
train an autoregressive GPT model and show that it can control a simulated
humanoid to perform natural motion completion given a motion prompt.

is a key challenge in modern quantum many-body physics. For example, the origin
of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains
one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of
high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe
formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model,
where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas
magnetic $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density
matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical
stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order
and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We
find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $J$,
hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the
many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin
correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are
enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model
can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose
hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and

quantum error correcting codes. In this paper, we study several examples of
such higher codimension defects from distinct perspectives. We mainly study a
class of invertible codimension-2 topological defects, which we refer to as
twist strings. We provide a number of general constructions for twist strings,
in terms of gauging lower dimensional invertible phases, layer constructions,
and condensation defects. We study some special examples in the context of
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with fermionic charges, in $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times

Abelian point charges, which defines an $H^4$ cohomology class that
characterizes part of an underlying 3-group symmetry of the topological order.

which includes a large class of terms in the action with various modes,
interactions and $\alpha'$ corrections. The entropy and the Noether charge are
shown to depend only on the values of fields at the boundary of space. The
classical entropy, which is proportional to the inverse of Newton's constant,
is then calculated by evaluating the appropriate boundary term for various
geometries with and without a horizon. We verify, in our framework, that for
higher-curvature pure gravity theories, the Wald entropy of static neutral
black hole solutions is equal to the entropy derived from the Gibbons-Hawking
boundary term. We then proceed to discuss horizonless geometries which contain,
due to the back-reaction of the strings and branes, a second boundary in
addition to the asymptotic boundary. Near this ``punctured'' boundary, the
time-time component of the metric and the derivatives of its logarithm approach
zero. Assuming that there are such non-singular solutions, we identify the
entropy of the strings and branes in this geometry with the entropy of the
solution to all orders in $\alpha'$. If the asymptotic region of an
$\alpha'$-corrected neutral black hole is connected through the bulk to a
puncture, then the black hole entropy is equal to the entropy of the strings
and branes. Later, we discuss configurations similar to the charged black
p-brane solutions of Horowitz and Strominger, with the second boundary, and
show that, to leading order in the $\alpha'$ expansion, the classical entropy
of the strings and branes is equal exactly to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
This result is extended to a configuration that asymptotes to AdS.

the differences in the halo properties in the different DM models compared to
DM-only simulations. This affects the satellite properties at infall and
therefore their subsequent tidal stripping and survival rates. Nonetheless, we
find slightly less concentrated satellite radial distributions as the SIDM
cross-section increases. Unfortunately, we also find that the satellite
populations in simulations with baryon-induced cores in CDM and WDM can mimic
the results found in SIDM, making the satellite stellar mass and maximum
circular velocity functions heavily degenerate on the assumed nature of the DM
and the adopted subgrid modelling. These degeneracies preclude using the
brightest satellites of the Milky Way to constrain the nature of DM.

exploded from a progenitor near the lower mass limits for SNe IIb. Finally,

include gravitational self-interactions in order to describe the transition of
the gravitational wave signal from the merger to the ringdown stage. In this
paper we study the phenomenology of the generation and propagation of
nonlinearities in the ringdown of a Schwarzschild black hole, using
second-order perturbation theory. Following earlier work, we show that the
Green's function and its causal structure determines how both first-order and
second-order perturbations are generated, and hence highlight that both of
these solutions share some physical properties. In particular, we discuss the
sense in which both linear and quadratic quasi-normal modes (QNMs) are
generated in the vicinity of the peak of the gravitational potential barrier
(loosely referred to as the light ring). Among the second-order perturbations,
there are solutions with linear QNM frequencies (whose amplitudes are thus
renormalized from their linear values), as well as quadratic QNM frequencies
with a distinct spectrum. Moreover, we show using a WKB analysis that, in the
eikonal limit, waves generated inside the light ring propagate towards the
black hole horizon, and only waves generated outside propagate towards an
asymptotic observer. These results might be relevant for recent discussions on
the validity of perturbation theory close to the merger. Finally, we argue that
even if nonlinearities are small, quadratic QNMs may be detectable and would
likely be useful for improving ringdown models of higher angular harmonics and
future tests of gravity.

only through the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters. The symmetric
logarithmic derivative Cram\'er-Rao bound (SLDCRB), gives the attainable
precision, if the optimal measurements for estimating each individual parameter
commute. When the optimal measurements do not commute, the SLDCRB is not
necessarily attainable. In this regard, the Holevo Cram\'er-Rao bound (HCRB)
plays a fundamental role, providing the ultimate attainable precisions when one
allows simultaneous measurements on infinitely many copies of a quantum state.
For practical purposes, the Nagaoka Cram\'er-Rao bound (NCRB) is more relevant,
applying when restricted to measuring quantum states individually. The
interplay between these three bounds dictates how rapidly the ultimate
metrological precisions can be approached through collective measurements on
finite copies of the probe state. We first consider two parameter estimation
and prove that if the HCRB cannot be saturated with a single copy of the probe
state, then it cannot be saturated for any finite number of copies of the probe
state. With this, we show that it is impossible to saturate the HCRB for
several physically motivated problems. For estimating any number of parameters,
we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the attainability of the
SLDCRB with separable measurements. We further prove that if the SLDCRB cannot
be reached with a single copy of the probe state, it cannot be reached with
collective measurements on any finite number of copies of the probe state.
These results together provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the
attainability of the SLDCRB for any finite number of copies of the probe state.

protoplanetary disks. Recent results suggest that solid material like pebbles
may contribute significantly to building up planetary atmospheres. In order to
link observed exoplanet atmospheres and their compositions to their formation
histories, it is important to understand how icy pebbles may change their
composition when they drift radially inwards in disks. Our goal is to model the
compositional evolution of ices on pebbles as they drift in disks, and track
how their chemical evolution en-route changes the ice composition relative to
the ice composition of the pebbles in the region where they grew from
micron-sized grains. A state-of-the-art chemical kinetics code is utilised for
modelling chemical evolution. This code accounts for the time-evolving sizes of
the solids that drift. Chemical evolution is modelled locally for 0.1Myr at two
starting radii, with the micron-sized solids growing into pebbles
simultaneously. The pebbles and local gas, isolated as a parcel, is then
exposed to changing physical conditions, intended to mimic the pebbles drifting
inwards in the disk midplane, moving to 1 AU on three different timescales. A
modelling simplification is that the pebbles are \emph{not} moved through, and
exposed to new gas, but stay in the same chemical gas surroundings in all
models. For ice species with initial abundances relative to hydrogen of
$>10^{-5}$, such as H$_{2}$O, CO$_{2}$, CH$_{3}$OH and NH$_{3}$, the abundances
change by less than 20% for both radii of origin, and for the two smaller drift
timescales (10kyr and 100kyr). For less abundant ice species, and the longest
drift timescale (1Myr), the changes are larger. Pebble drift chemistry
generally increases the ice abundances of CO$_{2}$, HCN and SO, at the expense
of decreasing abundances of other volatile molecules.

gases absorb in the mid infrared at wavelengths that are likely to be captured
while observing primary biosignatures such as O$_3$ or CH$_4$. We
quantitatively explore CH$_3$Br as a new capstone biosignature through
photochemical and spectral modeling of Earth-like planets orbiting FGKM stellar
hosts. We also re-examine the biosignature potential of CH$_3$Cl over the same
set of parameters using our updated model. We show that CH$_3$Cl and CH$_3$Br
can build up to relatively high levels in M dwarf environments and analyze
synthetic spectra of TRAPPIST-1e. Our results suggest that there is a
co-additive spectral effect from multiple CH$_3$X gases in an atmosphere,
leading to increased signal-to-noise and greater ability to detect a methylated
gas feature. These capstone biosignatures are plausibly detectable in
exoplanetary atmospheres, have low false positive potential, and would provide
strong evidence for life in conjunction with other well established
biosignature candidates.

technique for image augmentation by injecting contextually meaningful knowledge

object detection via language grounding, SemAug, starts by calculating
semantically appropriate new objects that can be placed into relevant locations
in the image (the what and where problems). Then it embeds these objects into
their relevant target locations, thereby promoting diversity of object instance
distribution. Our method allows for introducing new object instances and
categories that may not even exist in the training set. Furthermore, it does
not require the additional overhead of training a context network, so it can be
easily added to existing architectures. Our comprehensive set of evaluations
showed that the proposed method is very effective in improving the
generalization, while the overhead is negligible. In particular, for a wide
range of model architectures, our method achieved ~2-4% and ~1-2% mAP
improvements for the task of object detection on the Pascal VOC and COCO

hypothesized to be the ideal use case for quantum computing. To date, no
quantum computer has simulated a molecule of a size and complexity relevant to
real-world applications, despite the fact that the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE) algorithm can predict chemically accurate total energies.
Nevertheless, because of the many applications of moderately-sized, strongly
correlated systems, such as molecular catalysts, the successful use of the VQE
stands as an important waypoint in the advancement toward useful chemical
modeling on near-term quantum processors. In this paper, we take a significant
step in this direction. We lay out the steps, write, and run parallel code for
an (emulated) quantum computer to compute the bond dissociation curves of the
TiH, LiH, NaH, and KH diatomic hydride molecules using VQE. TiH was chosen as a
relatively simple chemical system that incorporates d orbitals and strong
electron correlation. Because current VQE implementations on existing quantum
hardware are limited by qubit error rates, the number of qubits available, and
the allowable gate depth, recent studies have focused on chemical systems
involving s and p block elements. Through VQE + UCCSD calculations of TiH, we
evaluate the near-term feasibility of modeling a molecule with d-orbitals on
real quantum hardware. We demonstrate that the inclusion of d-orbitals and the
use of the UCCSD ansatz, which are both necessary to capture the correct TiH
physics, dramatically increase the cost of this problem. We estimate the
approximate error rates necessary to model TiH on current quantum computing
hardware using VQE+UCCSD and show them to likely be prohibitive until
significant improvements in hardware and error correction algorithms are
available.

output is stored on an onsite disk buffer. When there is no beam in the LHC,
the same computing farm is used for the asynchronous reprocessing of the data
which yields the final reconstruction output. The O2 project consists of three
main parts:. The Event Processing Nodes (EPN) equipped with GPUs deliver the
bulk of the computing capacity and perform the majority of the reconstruction
and the calibration. The First Level Processors (FLP) receive the data via
optical links from the detectors and perform local processing where it is
needed, which can optionally happen in the user logic of the FPGA based readout
card. Between the FLP and the EPN farms the data is distributed in the network

We observed the 40 Myr old star DS Tuc A with XMM-Newton and
recorded two X-ray bright flares, with the second event occurring about 12 ks
after the first one. Their duration from the rise to the end of the decay was
of about 8-10 ks in soft X-rays (0.3-10 keV). The flares were also recorded in
the band 200-300 nm with the UVM2 filter of the Optical Monitor. The duration
of the flares in UV was about 3 ks. The observed delay between the peak in the
UV band and in X-rays is a probe of the heating phase followed by the
evaporation and increase of density and emission measure of the flaring loop.
The coronal plasma temperature at the two flare peaks reached 54-55 MK. The
diagnostics based on temperatures and time scales of the flares applied to
these two events allow us to infer a loop length of 5-7 x 10^10 cm, which is
about the size of the stellar radius. We also infer values of electron density
at the flare peaks of 2.3-6.5 x 10^11 cm^-3 , and a minimum magnetic field
strength of order of 300-500 G needed to confine the plasma. The energy
released during the flares was of order of 5-8 x 10^34 erg in the band 0.3-10
keV and 0.9-2.7 x 10^33 erg in the UV band (200-300 nm). We speculate that the
flares were associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) that hit the planet
about 3.3 hr after the flares and dramatically increasing the rate of
evaporation of the planet. From the RGS spectra we retrieved the emission
measure distribution and the abundances of coronal metals during the quiescent
and the flaring states. In agreement with what inferred from time resolved
spectroscopy and EPIC spectra, also from the analysis of RGS spectra during the
flares we infer a high electron density.

a harmonic oscillator (photon) with resonant or dispersive interactions, one
derives the corresponding quantum Stochastic Master Equations (SME) when either
the qubits or the photons are measured. Starting with an elementary
discrete-time formulation based on explicit formulae for the interaction
propagators, one shows how to include measurement imperfections and
decoherence. This qubit/photon quantum system illustrates the Kraus-map
structure of general discrete-time SME governing the dynamics of an open
quantum system subject to measurement back-action and decoherence induced by
the environment. Then, on the qubit/photon system, one explains the passage to
a continuous-time mathematical model where the measurement signal is either a
continuous real-value signal (typically homodyne or heterodyne signal) or a
discontinuous and integer-value signal obtained from a counter. During this
derivation, the Kraus map formulation is preserved in an infinitesimal way.
Such a derivation provides also an equivalent Kraus-map formulation to the
continuous-time SME usually expressed as stochastic differential equations
driven either by Wiener or Poisson processes. From such Kraus-map formulation,
simple linear numerical integration schemes are derived that preserve the
positivity and the trace of the density operator, i.e. of the quantum state.

for capturing global-local context across multiple scales. Each resolution
stream is enriched with features from different resolution scales, and
multi-scale information is aggregated to model diverse contextual ranges. As a
result, feature representations are further boosted. The comprehensive

multi-organ segmentation show that our proposed OARFocalFuseNet outperforms the
recent state-of-the-art methods on publicly available OpenKBP datasets and
Synapse multi-organ segmentation. Both of the proposed methods (3D-MSF and

in different domains, partly because of its ability to learn from data and

success usually relies on two assumptions: (i) vast troves of labeled datasets
are required for accurate model fitting, and (ii) training and testing data are
independent and identically distributed. Its performance on unseen target
domains, thus, is not guaranteed, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution data at the adaptation stage. The performance drop on data
in a target domain is a critical problem in deploying deep neural networks that
are successfully trained on data in a source domain. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) is proposed to counter this, by leveraging both labeled source
domain data and unlabeled target domain data to carry out various tasks in the
target domain. UDA has yielded promising results on natural image processing,
video analysis, natural language processing, time-series data analysis, medical

the performance of many quantum technologies. Coupling to well-defined phonon
modes allows for highly-connected multi-qubit gates in ion trap architectures
as well as the generation of entangled states in systems of superconducting
qubits. Even when the phonons take the form of a large dissipative bath, an
irreversible flow of heat allows for state initialization critical to the
function of laser systems and the operation of optically active spin qubits.
Conversely, unintended coupling to phonons has been shown to degrade qubit
performance by generating decohering quasiparticles and leading to correlated
errors in superconducting qubit systems. Regardless of whether a phononic bath
plays an enabling or deleterious role, it is typically intrinsic to the system
and does not admit specific control over its spectral properties, nor the
possibility of engineering aspects of its dissipation to be used as a resource.
Here we show that by precisely designing and controlling the coupling of a
superconducting qubit to phononic degrees of freedom allows a new type of
quantum control over superconducting circuits. By shaping the loss spectrum of
the qubit via its coupling to a bath of lossy piezoelectric surface acoustic
wave phonons, we are able to prepare and stabilize arbitrary qubit states.
Additionally, we find that the presence of the energy-dependent loss imparted
onto the qubit by the phonons is well-described by a master equation treatment
of the composite system, with excellent agreement in both the qubit dynamics as
well as its steady state. Our results demonstrate the ability of engineered
phononic dissipation to achieve highly efficient qubit control.

connection to the Bell inequalities. Starting discussion with complementarity,
we point out to contextuality as its seed. {\it Bohr-contextuality} is
dependence of observable's outcome on the experimental context, on
system-apparatus interaction. Probabilistically, complementarity means that the
{\it joint probability distribution} (JPD) does not exist. Instead of the JPD,
one has to operate with contextual probabilities. The Bell inequalities are
interpreted as the statistical tests of contextuality and, hence,
incompatibility. For context dependent probabilities, these inequalities may be
violated. We stress that contextuality tested by the Bell inequalities is so
called {\it joint measurement contextualit}y (JMC), the special case of Bohr's
contextuality. Then, we examine the role of signaling (marginal inconsistency).
In QM, signaling can be considered as an experimental artifact. However, often
experimental data has signaling patterns. We discuss possible sources of
signaling; for example, dependence of the state preparation on measurement
settings. In principle, one can extract the measure of ""pure contextualize""
from data shadowed by signaling. This theory known as {\it Contextuality by

coalesces using a greedy algorithm where adjacent segments are merged to
minimize a model comparison statistic; we use the Bayesian Information

demonstrating that it is capable of discerning irregularly shaped low

strengths comparable to that seen in typical X-ray data. We demonstrate

the dynamical evolution of the optical field in the cavity on all time scales:
the fast time scale of the pulse envelope within a single round trip, and the
slow time-scale between one round-trip to the next. We employ a nonlinear ABCD
formalism that fully handles all relevant effects in the laser, namely - self
focusing and diffraction, dispersion and SPM, space-dependent loss and gain
saturation. We confirm the validity of our model by reproducing the
pulse-formation in KLM in all aspects: The evolution of the pulse energy,
duration, and gain is observed during the entire cavity buildup (from
spontaneous noise to steady state), demonstrating the nonlinear mode
competition in full, as well as the dependence of the final pulse in steady
state on the interplay between gain bandwidth, dispersion and self-phase

of speech processing. Recent studies have demonstrated that contrastive
learning is able to learn discriminative speaker embeddings in a
self-supervised manner. However, base contrastive self-supervised learning
(CSSL) assumes that the pairs generated from a view of anchor instance and any
view of other instances are all negative, which introduces many false negative
pairs in constructing the loss function. The problem is referred as
$class$-$collision$, which remains as one major issue that impedes the CSSL
based speaker verification (SV) systems from achieving better performances. In
the meanwhile, studies reveal that negative sample free SSL frameworks perform
well in learning speaker or image representations. In this study, we
investigate SSL techniques that lead to an improved SV performance. We first
analyse the impact of false negative pairs in the CSSL systems. Then, a
multi-stage Class-Collision Correction (C3) method is proposed, which leads to
the state-of-the-art CSSL based speaker embedding system. On the basis of the
pretrained CSSL model, we further propose to employ a negative sample free SSL
objective (i.e., DINO) to fine-tune the speaker embedding network. The
resulting speaker embedding system (C3-DINO) achieves 2.5% EER with a simple
Cosine Distance Scoring method on Voxceleb1 test set, which outperforms the
previous SOTA SSL system (4.86%) by a significant +45% relative improvement.
With speaker clustering and pseudo labeling on Voxceleb2 training set, a
LDA/CDS back-end applying on the C3-DINO speaker embeddings is able to further
push the EER to 2.2%. Comprehensive experimental investigations of the Voxceleb
benchmarks and our internal dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, and the performance gap between the SSL SV and the supervised
counterpart narrows further.

into a key capability for fundamental investigations as well as for emerging
quantum technologies. In the single-photon, protocol entanglement is heralded
by generation of qubit-photon entangled states and subsequent detection of a
single photon behind a beam splitter. In this work we perform a detailed
theoretical and experimental investigation of this protocol and its various
sources of infidelity. We develop an extensive theoretical model and
subsequently tailor it to our experimental setting, based on nitrogen-vacancy
centers in diamond. Experimentally, we verify the model by generating remote
states for varying phase and amplitudes of the initial qubit superposition
states and varying optical phase difference of the photons arriving at the beam
splitter. We show that a static frequency offset between the optical
transitions of the qubits leads to an entangled state phase that depends on the
photon detection time. We find that the implementation of a Charge-Resonance
check on the nitrogen-vacancy center yields transform-limited linewidths.
Moreover, we measure the probability of double optical excitation, a
significant source of infidelity, as a function of the power of the excitation
pulse. Finally, we find that imperfect optical excitation can lead to a
detection-arm-dependent entangled state fidelity and rate. The conclusion
presented here are not specific to the nitrogen-vacancy centers used to carry
out the experiments, and are therefore readily applicable to other qubit
platforms.

direct manifestation of the intrinsic topological properties of a material and
an appealing attribute for low-power electronics applications. The QAH effect
has been observed in both graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)
moir\'e materials. It is thought to arise from the interaction-driven valley
polarization of the narrow moir\'e bands. Here, we show surprisingly that the
newly discovered QAH state in AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 moir\'e bilayers is not
valley-polarized but valley-coherent. The layer- and helicity-resolved optical
spectroscopy measurement reveals that the QAH ground state possesses
spontaneous spin (valley) polarization aligned (anti-aligned) in two TMD
layers. In addition, saturation of the out-of-plane spin polarization in both
layers occurs only under high magnetic fields, supporting a canted spin
texture. Our results call for a new mechanism for the QAH effect and highlight
the potential of TMD moir\'e materials with strong electronic correlations and

stochastic processes, namely stable L\'evy processes, and fractional Brownian
motion. For this reason it may be regarded as a basic building block for
continuous time models. We study a stylized model consisting of a superposition
of independent linear fractional stable motions and our focus is on parameter
estimation of the model. Applying an estimating equations approach, we
construct estimators for the whole set of parameters and derive their
asymptotic normality in a high-frequency regime. The conditions for consistency
turn out to be sharp for two prominent special cases: (i) for L\'evy processes,
i.e. for the estimation of the successive Blumenthal-Getoor indices, and (ii)
for the mixed fractional Brownian motion introduced by Cheridito. In the
remaining cases, our results reveal a delicate interplay between the Hurst
parameters and the indices of stability. Our asymptotic theory is based on new
limit theorems for multiscale moving average processes.

Beginning with the space of all possible instantaneous afferent inputs to the

culminates in a perceptual space in which categorical odor representations are
hierarchically constructed, exhibiting statistically appropriate consequential
regions and clear relationships between the broader and narrower identities to
which a given odor might be assigned. Individual training and experience
generates correspondingly more sophisticated odor identification capabilities.
Critically, because these idiosyncratic hierarchies are constructed from

describe the capabilities of the system. This generative framework also
encompasses hypotheses explaining representational drift in postbulbar circuits

of modern randomised algorithms. Usually, the mixing time is measured with
respect to the worst initial position. It is well known that the presence of
bottlenecks in a graph hampers mixing and, in particular, starting inside a
small bottleneck significantly slows down the diffusion of the walk in the
first steps of the process. To circumvent this problem, the average mixing time
is defined to be the mixing time starting at a uniformly random vertex.
  In this paper we provide a general framework to show logarithmic average
mixing time for random walks on graphs with small bottlenecks. The framework is
especially effective on certain families of random graphs with heterogeneous
properties. We demonstrate its applicability on two random models for which the
mixing time was known to be of order $\log^2n$, speeding up the mixing to order
$\log n$. First, in the context of smoothed analysis on connected graphs, we
show logarithmic average mixing time for randomly perturbed graphs of bounded
degeneracy. A particular instance is the Newman-Watts small-world model.
Second, we show logarithmic average mixing time for supercritically percolated
expander graphs. When the host graph is complete, this application gives an
alternative proof that the average mixing time of the giant component in the
supercritical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph is logarithmic.

Burer-Monteiro (B-M) factorization. The SDP method suffers from high
computational and space complexities, whereas the B-M method may return a
spurious solution due to the non-convexity of the problem. The existing
theoretical guarantees for the success of these methods have led to similar
conservative conditions, which may wrongly imply that these methods have
comparable performances. In this paper, we shed light on some major differences
between these two methods. First, we present a class of structured matrix
completion problems for which the B-M methods fail with an overwhelming

of highly sparse matrix completion problems for which the B-M method works and
the SDP method fails. Third, we prove that although the B-M method exhibits the
same performance independent of the rank of the unknown solution, the success
of the SDP method is correlated to the rank of the solution and improves as the
rank increases. Unlike the existing literature that has mainly focused on those
instances of matrix sensing for which both SDP and B-M work, this paper offers
the first result on the unique merit of each method over the alternative

(SLAM) for autonomous mobile systems. In the field of visual SLAM, bag of words
(BoW) has achieved great success in loop closure. The BoW features for loop
searching can also be used in the subsequent 6-DoF loop correction. However,
for 3D LiDAR SLAM, the state-of-the-art methods may fail to effectively
recognize the loop in real time, and usually cannot correct the full 6-DoF loop
pose. To address this limitation, we present a novel Bag of Words for real-time
loop closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM, called BoW3D. Our method not only efficiently
recognizes the revisited loop places, but also corrects the full 6-DoF loop
pose in real time. BoW3D builds the bag of words based on the 3D LiDAR feature
LinK3D, which is efficient, pose-invariant and can be used for accurate
point-to-point matching. We furthermore embed our proposed method into 3D LiDAR
odometry system to evaluate loop closing performance. We test our method on
public dataset, and compare it against other state-of-the-art algorithms. BoW3D
shows better performance in terms of F1 max and extended precision scores on
most scenarios. It is noticeable that BoW3D takes an average of 48 ms to
recognize and correct the loops on KITTI 00 (includes 4K+ 64-ray LiDAR scans),
when executed on a notebook with an Intel Core i7 @2.2 GHz processor. We

from the nontrivial mapping from a 3D sphere to a 2D sphere, known as the Hopf

microring, a 2D lattice of microring resonators can emulate an $N$-band
photonic Hopf insulator with nontrivial Hopf index. In particular, we show by
numerical computation and direct analytical proof that the $N$-band Hopf index
of the microring lattice is identical to its winding number. The result shows
that the Hopf index is an alternative topological invariant for classifying 2D
microring photonic lattices and establishes a correspondence between the Hopf

generally, our work shows that 2D microring lattices can provide a versatile
nanophotonic platform for studying non-Abelian topological photonic systems.

consequences on the growth of higher R\'enyi entropies in isolated quantum

systems that the dynamics of the R\'enyi entropies in the presence of a U(1)
symmetry obey $S^{(n\geq 2)}(t) \propto t^{1/z}$, where $z$ is identified as
the dynamical exponent characterizing transport of the conserved charges. Here,
however, we demonstrate that this simple identification may not hold in certain
quantum systems with kinetic constraints. In particular, we study two types of
U(1)-symmetric quantum automaton circuits with XNOR and Fredkin constraints,
respectively. We find numerically that while spin transport in both models is
subdiffusive, the second R\'enyi entropy grows diffusively in the XNOR model,
and superdiffusively in the Fredkin model. For systems with XNOR constraint,
this distinction arises since the spin correlation function can be attributed

solutions restrict the client to $\mathcal{O}(B)$ bits of private memory. A
class of solutions, known as Hierarchical ORAM, has achieved theoretically
optimal bandwidth performance in this setting. Hierarchical ORAM distributes
data blocks at the server across a hierarchy of hash tables, with the most
recently accessed blocks in the lower levels of the hierarchy. Locating a block

aims to localize and classify actions in untrimmed videos. The previous methods
often predict actions on a feature space of a single-temporal scale. However,
the temporal features of a low-level scale lack enough semantics for action
classification while a high-level scale cannot provide rich details of the
action boundaries. To address this issue, we propose to predict actions on a
feature space of multi-temporal scales. Specifically, we use refined feature
pyramids of different scales to pass semantics from high-level scales to
low-level scales. Besides, to establish the long temporal scale of the entire
video, we use a spatial-temporal transformer encoder to capture the long-range
dependencies of video frames. Then the refined features with long-range
dependencies are fed into a classifier for the coarse action prediction.
Finally, to further improve the prediction accuracy, we propose to use a
frame-level self attention module to refine the classification and boundaries
of each action instance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method

DV qubits, via CV-entangled states, can be significantly improved by a new
protocol defined by a modified Bell state measurement at the sender. This work
explores whether a new, similarly modified, CV-based teleportation protocol can
lead to improvement in the transfer of hybrid entangled states. To set the
scene, we first determine the performance of such a modified protocol in
teleporting CV-only qubits, showing that significant improvement over
traditional CV-based teleportation is obtained. We then explore similar
modifications in the teleportation of a specific hybrid entangled state showing
that significant improvement over traditional CV-based teleportation is again
found. For a given channel loss, we find teleporting the DV qubit of the hybrid
entangled state can always achieve higher fidelity than teleporting the CV
qubit. We then explore the use of various non-Gaussian operations in our
modified teleportation protocol, finding that, at a cost of lower success
probability, quantum scissors provides the most improvement in the loss
tolerance. Our new results emphasize that in lossy conditions, the quantum
measurements undertaken at the sender can have a surprising and dramatic impact
on CV-based teleportation.

the accuracy of the WFA and resulting in an inference bias, which is more
pronounced the poorer the resolution. When applied to a diverse set of spectra

likelihood estimator (NPMLE) in multivariate mixture models. Our first approach
discretizes this infinite dimensional convex optimization problem by fixing the
support points of the NPMLE and optimizing over the mixture proportions. In
this context we propose, leveraging the sparsity of the solution, an efficient
and scalable semismooth Newton based augmented Lagrangian method (ALM). Our
algorithm beats the state-of-the-art methods~\cite{koenker2017rebayes,
kim2020fast} and can handle $n \approx 10^6$ data points with $m \approx 10^4$
support points. Our second procedure, which combines the
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm with the ALM approach above, allows for
joint optimization of both the support points and the probability weights. For
both our algorithms we provide formal results on their (superlinear)
convergence properties.
  The computed NPMLE can be immediately used for denoising the observations in
the framework of empirical Bayes. We propose new denoising estimands in this
context along with their consistent estimates. Extensive numerical experiments
are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods. In particular, we
employ our procedures to analyze two astronomy data sets: (i) Gaia-TGAS
Catalog~\cite{anderson2018improving} containing $n \approx 1.4 \times 10^6$
data points in two dimensions, and (ii) the $d=19$ dimensional data set from

content moderation. These platforms have recently leveraged machine learning
models to cope with the vast amount of user-generated content daily. Since
moderation policies vary depending on countries and types of products, it is
common to train and deploy the models per policy. However, this approach is
highly inefficient, especially when the policies change, requiring dataset
re-labeling and model re-training on the shifted data distribution. To
alleviate this cost inefficiency, social media platforms often employ
third-party content moderation services that provide prediction scores of
multiple subtasks, such as predicting the existence of underage personnel, rude
gestures, or weapons, instead of directly providing final moderation decisions.
However, making a reliable automated moderation decision from the prediction
scores of the multiple subtasks for a specific target policy has not been
widely explored yet. In this study, we formulate real-world scenarios of
content moderation and introduce a simple yet effective threshold optimization
method that searches the optimal thresholds of the multiple subtasks to make a
reliable moderation decision in a cost-effective way. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach shows better performance in content moderation
compared to existing threshold optimization methods and heuristics.

the task is to find routes for a team of robots to maximize the collection of
rewards associated with features in the environment. These features can be
one-dimensional or points in the environment, and can have spatial correlation,
i.e., visiting a feature in the environment may provide a portion of the reward
associated with a correlated feature. A robot incurs costs as it traverses the
environment, and the total cost for its route is limited by a resource
constraint such as battery life or operation time. As environments are often
large, we permit multiple depots where the robots must start and end their
routes. The CAOP generalizes the correlated orienteering problem (COP), where
the rewards are only associated with point features, and the arc orienteering
problem (AOP), where the rewards are not spatially correlated. We formulate a
mixed integer quadratic program (MIQP) that formalizes the problem and gives
optimal solutions. However, the problem is NP-hard, and therefore we develop an
efficient greedy constructive algorithm. We illustrate the problem with two
different applications: informative path planning for methane gas leak

recommend not only entities of a single base entity type (e.g., papers in the
scientific literature KG, products in an e-commerce KG), but also all other
types (e.g., authors, conferences, institutions; sellers, buyers). We implement
our technique in a novel system, FeedLens, which is built over Semantic
Scholar, a production system for navigating the scientific literature KG.
FeedLens reuses the existing preference models on Semantic Scholar -- people's
curated research feeds -- as lenses for exploratory search. Semantic Scholar
users can curate multiple feeds/lenses for different topics of interest, e.g.,
one for human-centered AI and another for document embeddings. Although these
lenses are defined in terms of papers, FeedLens re-purposes them to also guide
search over authors, institutions, venues, etc. Our system design is based on
feedback from intended users via two pilot surveys (n=17 and n=13,
respectively). We compare FeedLens and Semantic Scholar via a third

engagement while reducing the cognitive effort required to complete a short

  Collaborative UAVs Networks: A Meta-Heuristic Approach","14 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.NI eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) assisted mobile edge
computing systems have been exploited by researchers as a promising solution
for providing computation services to mobile users outside of terrestrial
infrastructure coverage. However, it remains challenging for the standalone
MEC-enabled UAVs in order to meet the computation requirement of numerous
mobile users due to the limited computation capacity of their onboard servers
and battery lives. Therefore, we propose a collaborative scheme among UAVs so
that UAVs can share the workload with idle UAVs. Moreover, current task
offloading strategies frequently overlook task topology, which may result in
poor performance or even system failure. To address the problem, we consider
offloading tasks consisting of a set of sub-tasks, and each sub-task has
dependencies on other sub-tasks, which is practical in the real world.
Sub-tasks with dependencies need to wait for the resulting signal from
preceding sub-tasks before being executed. This mechanism has serious effects
on the offloading strategy. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to
minimize the average latency experienced by users by jointly controlling the
offloading decision for dependent tasks and allocating the communication
resources of UAVs. The formulated problem appears to be NP-hard and cannot be
solved in polynomial time. Therefore, we divide the problem into two
sub-problems: the offloading decision problem and the communication resource
allocation problem. Then a meta-heuristic method is proposed to find the
sub-optimal solution of the task offloading problem, while the communication
resource allocation problem is solved by using convex optimization. Finally, we
perform substantial simulation experiments, and the result shows that the
proposed offloading technique effectively minimizes the average latency of
users, compared with other benchmark schemes.

We consider a sequence of systems with $n$ servers, where the arrival rate of
the $n^{\text{th}}$ system is $\lambda=n-n^{1-\gamma}$ for some $\gamma \in (0,
0.5)$. This is known as the sub Halfin-Whitt regime. It was shown in [Liu,
Ying, 2020] that under the Power-of-$d$ choices routing with $d \geq
n^\gamma\log n$, the queue length behaves similar to that of JSQ, and that
there is asymptotically zero queueing delay.
  The focus of this paper is to characterize the behavior when $d$ is below
this threshold. We obtain high probability bounds on the queue lengths for
various values of $d$ and large enough $n$. In particular, we show that when
$d$ grows polynomially in $n$, but slower than in [Liu, Ying, 2020], i.e., if
$d$ is $O\left((n^\gamma\log n)^{1/m})\right)$ for some integer $m>1$, then the
asymptotic queue length is $m$ with high probability. This finite queue length
behavior is similar to that of JSQ in the so-called nondegenerate slowdown
regime (where $\gamma=1$). Moreover, if $d$ grows polylog in $n$, but is at
least $\Omega(\log (n)^3)$, the queue length blows up to infinity
asymptotically similar to that under JSQ in the so-called super slow down
regime ($\gamma>1$). We obtain these results by deploying the iterative state
space collapse approach that was first developed in [Liu, Gong, Ying, 2022]. We
first establish a weak state-space collapse on the queue lengths. We then
bootstrap from this weak collapse to iteratively narrow down the region of the
collapse. After enough steps, this inductive refinement of the collapse
provides the bounds that we seek. These sequence of collapses are established
using Lyapunov drift arguments.

obtained by restricting the matrix-valued function to small subspaces, whose

decay in the errors of the minimizers of the reduced problems. In mathematical
terms, the problem we consider is a large-scale nonconvex minimax eigenvalue
optimization problem such that the eigenvalue function appears in the

provide a framework for parameter estimation and then prediction. It is
well-known that parameters are not always uniquely identifiable. In this paper
we consider network-based mean-field models and explore the problem of
parameter identifiability when observations about an epidemic are available.
Making use of the analytical tractability of most network-based mean-field
models, e.g., explicit analytical expressions for leading eigenvalue and final
epidemic size, we set up the parameter identifiability problem as finding the
solution or solutions of a system of coupled equations. More precisely, subject
to observing/measuring growth rate and final epidemic size, we seek to identify
parameter values leading to these measurements. We are particularly concerned
with disentangling transmission rate from the network density. To do this we
define strong and weak identifiability and we find that except for the simplest
model, parameters cannot be uniquely determined, that is they are weakly
identifiable. This means that there exists multiple solutions (a manifold of
infinite measure) which give rise to model output that is close to the data.
Identifying, formalising and analytically describing this problem should lead
to a better appreciation of the complexity involved in fitting models with many
parameters to data.

clean images, is expensive and time-consuming. Hence, methods such as
Noise2Noise (N2N) that require only pairs of noise-corrupted images have been
developed to reduce the burden of obtaining training datasets. In this study,
we propose a new self-supervised denoising method, Coil2Coil (C2C), that does
not require the acquisition of clean images or paired noise-corrupted images
for training. Instead, the method utilizes multichannel data from phased-array
coils to generate training images. First, it divides and combines multichannel
coil images into two images, one for input and the other for label. Then, they
are processed to impose noise independence and sensitivity normalization such
that they can be used for the training images of N2N. For inference, the method
inputs a coil-combined image (e.g., DICOM image), enabling a wide application
of the method. When evaluated using synthetic noise-added images, C2C shows the
best performance against several self-supervised methods, reporting comparable
outcomes to supervised methods. When testing the DICOM images, C2C successfully
denoised real noise without showing structure-dependent residuals in the error
maps. Because of the significant advantage of not requiring additional scans
for clean or paired images, the method can be easily utilized for various

topological systems. Recently, the relations between the topological number and
the dynamics are built. But a direct method to read out the topological number
via the dynamics is still lacking. In this work, we propose a new dynamical
protocol to directly measure the topological number of an unknown system.
Different from common quench operations, we change the Hamiltonian of the
unknown system to another one with known topological properties. After the
quench, different initial states result in different particle number
distributions on the post-quench final Bloch bands. Such distributions depend
on the wavefunction overlap between the initial Bloch state and the final Bloch
state, which is a complex number depending on the momentum. We prove a theorem
that when the momentum varies by $2\pi$, the phase of the wavefunction overlap
change by $\Delta n\pi$ where $\Delta n$ is the topological number difference
between the initial Bloch band and the final Bloch band. Based on this and the
known topological number of the final Bloch band, we can directly deduce the
topological number of the initial state from the particle number distribution
and need not track the evolution of the system nor measure the spin texture.
Two experimental schemes are also proposed as well. These schemes provide a
convenient and robust measurement method and also deepens the understanding of
the relation between topology and dynamics.

we introduced hole ratio, a new topology-based validation measure that
quantifies the size of the topological defects taking into account the size of
the structure of interest. Using two publicly available datasets, we
quantitatively evaluated our proposed method based on three complementary

Our results evidence that our topology-integrative framework outperforms

both quantitative and qualitative results, on a wide range of gestational ages

the mechanisms that drive extreme events. Useful metrics for quantifying such
risk are extreme quantiles of response variables conditioned on predictor
variables that describe, e.g., climate, biosphere and environmental states.
Typically these quantiles lie outside the range of observable data and so, for
estimation, require specification of parametric extreme value models within a
regression framework. Classical approaches in this context utilise linear or
additive relationships between predictor and response variables and suffer in
either their predictive capabilities or computational efficiency; moreover,
their simplicity is unlikely to capture the truly complex structures that lead
to the creation of extreme wildfires. In this paper, we propose a new
methodological framework for performing extreme quantile regression using
artificial neutral networks, which are able to capture complex non-linear
relationships and scale well to high-dimensional data. The ``black box"" nature
of neural networks means that they lack the desirable trait of interpretability
often favoured by practitioners; thus, we unify linear, and additive,
regression methodology with deep learning to create partially-interpretable
neural networks that can be used for statistical inference but retain high
prediction accuracy. To complement this methodology, we further propose a novel
point process model for extreme values which overcomes the finite
lower-endpoint problem associated with the generalised extreme value class of
distributions. Efficacy of our unified framework is illustrated on U.S.
wildfire data with a high-dimensional predictor set and we illustrate vast
improvements in predictive performance over linear and spline-based regression

obvious difference when JND is assessed in such two domains since the visual
signal in the real world is encoded before it is delivered into the brain with
the human visual system (HVS). Hence, we propose an HVS-inspired signal
degradation network for JND estimation. To achieve this, we carefully analyze
the HVS perceptual process in JND subjective viewing to obtain relevant
insights, and then design an HVS-inspired signal degradation (HVS-SD) network
to represent the signal degradation in the HVS. On the one hand, the well
learnt HVS-SD enables us to assess the JND in the perceptual domain. On the
other hand, it provides more accurate prior information for better guiding JND
generation. Additionally, considering the requirement that reasonable JND

proposed to control JND generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the

utterance-level representations from each modality as the global multimodal
context to interact with local unimodal features and mutually promote each

cross-modal interaction methods but also leads to better performance. To
improve model robustness in the incomplete modality setting, on the one hand,
DLFR performs low-level feature reconstruction to implicitly encourage the
model to learn semantic information from incomplete data. On the other hand, it
innovatively regards complete and incomplete data as two different views of one
sample and utilizes siamese representation learning to explicitly attract their
high-level representations. Comprehensive experiments on three popular datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both complete and

this, we construct a probabilistic source model by incorporating priors on the

Uncertainties are estimated by employing a Laplace approximation and
incorporated to identify target data points that do not lie in the source

different domains at scale can be two critical issues in building a
task-oriented dialogue system. In this paper, we propose a novel manual-guided
dialogue scheme to alleviate these problems, where the agent learns the tasks
from both dialogue and manuals. The manual is an unstructured textual document
that guides the agent in interacting with users and the database during the
conversation. Our proposed scheme reduces the dependence of dialogue models on
fine-grained domain ontology, and makes them more flexible to adapt to various
domains. We then contribute a fully-annotated multi-domain dataset MagDial to
support our scheme. It introduces three dialogue modeling subtasks: instruction
matching, argument filling, and response generation. Modeling these subtasks is
consistent with the human agent's behavior patterns. Experiments demonstrate
that the manual-guided dialogue scheme improves data efficiency and domain
scalability in building dialogue systems. The dataset and benchmark will be
publicly available for promoting future research.

under a prescribed decoding metric, and is thus a highly relevant fundamental
performance metric when dealing with many practically important communication
scenarios. Compared with the frequently used generalized mutual information
(GMI), the LM rate has been known as a tighter lower bound of the mismatch
capacity. The computation of the LM rate, however, has been a difficult task,
due to the fact that the LM rate involves a maximization over a function of the
channel input, which becomes challenging as the input alphabet size grows, and
direct numerical methods (e.g., interior point methods) suffer from intensive
memory and computational resource requirements. Noting that the computation of
the LM rate can also be formulated as an entropy-based optimization problem
with constraints, in this work, we transform the task into an optimal transport
(OT) problem with an extra constraint. This allows us to efficiently and
accurately accomplish our task by using the well-known Sinkhorn algorithm.
Indeed, only a few iterations are required for convergence, due to the fact
that the formulated problem does not contain additional regularization terms.
Moreover, we convert the extra constraint into a root-finding procedure for a
one-dimensional monotonic function. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
feasibility and efficiency of our OT approach to the computation of the LM
rate.

Second, the intricate expression of the PDF of the AoA estimation error is
simplified by employing the first-order linear approximation of triangle
functions. Then, we derive a complex expression for the variance based on the
derived PDF. Specifically, for the azimuth estimation error, the variance is
separately integrated according to the different non-zero intervals of the PDF.
Finally, we apply the weighted least square (WLS) algorithm to estimate the 3D
position of the MU by using the estimated AoAs and the obtained non-Gaussian
variance. Extensive simulation results confirm that the derived angle

make the power transmission and distribution systems reliable and resilient.
Therefore, it is important to maintain their reliability and to monitor their
operation. A key to ensure a reliable operation of CBs is to monitor their
condition. In this work, we performed an accelerated life testing for
mechanical failures of a vacuum circuit breaker (VCB) by performing close-open
operations continuously until failure. We recorded data for each operation and
made the collected run-to-failure dataset publicly available. In our
experiments, the VCB operated more than 26000 close-open operations without
current load with the time span of five months. The run-to-failure long-term
monitoring enables us to monitor the evolution of the VCB condition and the
degradation over time. To monitor CB condition, closing time is one of the
indicators, which is usually measured when the CB is taken out of operation and
is completely disconnected from the network. We propose an algorithm that
enables to infer the same information on the closing time from a non-intrusive
sensor. By utilizing the short-time energy (STE) of the vibration signal, it is
possible to identify the key moments when specific events happen including the
time when the latch starts to move, and the closing time. The effectiveness of
the proposed algorithm is evaluated on the VCB dataset and is also compared to
the binary segmentation (BS) change point detection algorithm. This research
highlights the potential for continuous online condition monitoring, which is
the basis for applying future predictive maintenance strategies.

In the former case, active pressure is sensitive to initial conditions. Given

higher motility. By contrast, in the regime of strong motility, active pressure
is nonsensitive to initial conditions and is found to be higher in the region

active particles are unable to permeate through the membrane, maintaining the

emitters it is necessary to take charge equilibration into account. The charge
current which is locally induced by a fs laser pulse and the inverse spin-Hall
effect (ISHE) leads to ultrafast charging phenomena at the edge of the
illuminated area. Subsequent discharging leads to a current backflow with a
delay and a time constant that mainly depends on the conductivity of the
emitter. On the one hand, only this delayed charge equilibration allows the
detection of the primary current pulse via THz emission because an
instantaneous backflow would cancel any far field emission. On the other hand,
especially for longer light pulses the backflow can significantly change the
emitted spectrum compared to the initial spin-current pulse by suppressing low
frequency components. For the analysis of spin physics based on the charge
current profile it is important to understand that the timing of the spin
current cannot be inferred from the charge current unless the contribution by
the ISHE and the backflow can be deconvoluted.

point illustrates this relevance by showing features that are reminiscent of
the ones observed in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, underscoring that they are not unique

where it is harder to predict entities that appear less frequently in knowledge

Firstly, we propose the Knowledge Relational Attention Network (KRAT) to
leverage the graph context by simultaneously projecting neighboring triples to
different latent spaces and jointly aggregating messages with the attention
mechanism. KRAT is capable of capturing the subtle semantic information and
importance of different context triples as well as leveraging multi-hop
information in knowledge graphs. Secondly, we propose the knowledge contrastive
loss by combining the contrastive loss with cross entropy loss, which
introduces more negative samples and thus enriches the feedback to sparse
entities. Our experiments demonstrate that KRACL achieves superior results
across various standard knowledge graph benchmarks, especially on WN18RR and
NELL-995 which have large numbers of low in-degree entities. Extensive
experiments also bear out KRACL's effectiveness in handling sparse knowledge

heating leads to a systematic increase of the azimuthal velocity dispersion
($\sigma_\phi$) of stellar particles and a corresponding decrease in their mean
azimuthal velocities ($\overline{v}_\phi$). The rate of heating is dictated
primarily by the number of dark matter halo particles (or equivalently, by the
dark matter particle mass at fixed halo mass) and by radial gradients in the
local dark matter density along the disc; it is largely insensitive to the
stellar particle mass. Galaxies within haloes resolved with fewer than $\approx
10^6$ dark matter particles are particularly susceptible to spurious
morphological evolution, irrespective of the total halo mass (with even more
particles required to prevent heating of the galactic centre). Collisional
heating transforms galactic discs from flattened structures into rounder
spheroidal systems, causing them to lose rotational support in the process. It
also affects the locations of galaxies in standard scaling relations that link
their various properties: at fixed stellar mass, it increases the sizes of
galaxies, and reduces their mean stellar rotation velocities and specific
angular momenta. Our results urge caution when extrapolating simulated galaxy
scaling relations to low masses where spurious collisional effects can bias
their normalisation, slope and scatter.

these recommendations as providing helpful information, such as when risk
assessments are presented to judges or doctors. But when a decision-maker
obtains a recommendation, they may not only react to the information. The
decision-maker may view the recommendation as a default action, making it
costly for them to deviate, for example when a judge is reluctant to overrule a
high-risk assessment of a defendant or a doctor fears the consequences of
deviating from recommended procedures. In this article, we consider the effect
and design of recommendations when they affect choices not just by shifting
beliefs, but also by altering preferences. We motivate our model from
institutional factors, such as a desire to avoid audits, as well as from
well-established models in behavioral science that predict loss aversion
relative to a reference point, which here is set by the algorithm. We show that
recommendation-dependent preferences create inefficiencies where the
decision-maker is overly responsive to the recommendation, which changes the
optimal design of the algorithm towards providing less conservative
recommendations. As a potential remedy, we discuss an algorithm that
strategically withholds recommendations, and show how it can improve the

smaller heated regions compared to impacts at steeper angles. We derive an

mesoscale eddy energy dissipation time-scale within the ocean, related to the
geographical energy transfer rate out of the geostrophic mesoscales, is
provided by means of a simple and computational inexpensive inverse
calculation. Data diagnosed from a high resolution global configuration ocean
simulation is supplied to a parameterized model of the geostrophic mesoscale
eddy energy, from which the dissipation time-scale results as a solution to an
optimization calculation. We find that the dissipation time-scale is shortest
in the Southern Ocean, in the Western Boundary Currents, and on the western
boundaries, consistent with the expectation that these regions are notable
sites of baroclinic activity with processes leading to energy transfer out of
the geostrophic mesoscales. Although our solution should be interpreted as a
lower bound given the assumptions going into the calculation, it serves as an
important physically consistent base line reference for further investigations
into ocean energetics, as well as for an intended inference calculation that is
more complete but also much more complex.

bachelor-level introduction to software engineering course is taken by about
500 students from eight study programs, organised into 72 project teams. The
course aims to educate reflective systems developers. The teaching staff
includes 29 teaching assistants as supervisor and product owners for teams.
Project teams get feedback on seven deliverables as part of formative portfolio
assessment. Students expressed frustration on feedback not being aligned, that
they got critique on topics not stated in assignments and that teaching
assistants were reluctant to discuss the feedback. This article provides a
description of the course design, an assessment of the quality of feedback and
lessons learned from three main changes: Revising assignments and rubrics,
reorganising the teaching staff and increasing training of teaching assistants.
In discussing the changes, we draw on a survey to students with 142

minutes from a student reference group and experience reports from teaching
assistants as well as literature and own experience. The article concludes with
three actionable lessons learned for large-scale semi-capstone courses.

generation and line contingencies in the presence of the renewable generation.
The uncertainty due to renewables is modeled using joint chance-constraint and
the mismatch caused by contingencies and renewables are handled using reserves.
We consider a distributionally robust approach to solve the chance-constrained
program. We assume that samples of the uncertainty are available. Using them,
we construct a set of distributions, termed ambiguity set, containing all
distributions that are close to the empirical distribution under the
Wasserstein metric. The chance constraint is imposed for all distributions in
the ambiguity set to form the distributionally robust optimization problem.
This problem is nonconvex and computationally heavy to solve exactly. We adopt
a two-step approach to find an approximate solution. In the first step, we
construct a polyhedral set in the space of uncertainty that contains enough
mass under all distributions in the ambiguity set. This set is constructed by
solving several two-dimensional distributionally robust problems. In the second
step, we solve a linear robust optimization problem where the uncertain
constraint is imposed for all uncertainty values lying in the polyhedral set.
We demonstrate the scalability and robustness of our method using numerical
experiments.

The photodesorption spectra from the mixed ices reveal an indirect desorption
mechanism for which the desorption of $^{15}$N$_2$ and $^{13}$CO is triggered
by the photo-absorption of respectively $^{13}$CO and $^{15}$N$_2$. This
mechanism is confirmed by the X-ray photodesorption of $^{13}$CO from a layered
$^{13}$CO/$^{15}$N$_2$ ice irradiated at 401 eV, on the N 1s$\rightarrow \pi^*$
transition of $^{15}$N$_2$. This latter experiment enables to quantify the
relevant depth involved in the indirect desorption process, which is found to
be 30 - 40 ML in that case. This value is further related to the energy
transport of Auger electrons emitted from the photo-absorbing $^{15}$N$_2$
molecules that scatter towards the ice surface, inducing the desorption of
$^{13}$CO. The photodesorption yields corrected from the energy that can
participate to the desorption process (expressed in molecules desorbed by eV
deposited) do not depend on the photon energy hence neither on the
photo-absorbing molecule nor on its state after Auger decay. This demonstrates
that X-ray induced electron stimulated desorption (XESD), mediated by Auger
scattering, is the dominant process explaining the desorption of $^{15}$N$_2$
and $^{13}$CO from the ices studied in this work.

a method to infer cultural regions based on the automatic analysis of large

words' usage are found, and from there, principal components of regional

of discussion that define them. It uncovers a manifest North-South separation,
which is primarily influenced by the African American culture, and further
contiguous (East-West) and non-contiguous divisions that provide a
comprehensive picture of today's cultural areas in the US.

a set of distributed processes. Atomic multicast is its natural generalization
where each message $m$ is addressed to $dst(m)$, a subset of the processes
called its destination group. A solution to atomic multicast is genuine when a
process takes steps only if a message is addressed to it. Genuine solutions are
the ones used in practice because they have better performance.
  Let $G$ be all the destination groups and $F$ be the cyclic families in it,
that is the subsets of $G$ whose intersection graph is hamiltonian. This paper
establishes that the weakest failure detector to solve genuine atomic multicast
is $\mu=(\wedge_{g,h \in G}~\Sigma_{g \cap h}) \wedge (\wedge_{g \in
G}~\Omega_g) \wedge \gamma$, where (i) $\Sigma_P$ and $\Omega_P$ are the quorum
and leader failure detectors restricted to the processes in $P$, and (ii)
$\gamma$ is a new failure detector that informs the processes in a cyclic
family $f \in F$ when $f$ is faulty.
  We also study two classical variations of atomic multicast. The first
variation requires that message delivery follows the real-time order. In this
case, $\mu$ must be strengthened with $1^{g \cap h}$, the indicator failure
detector that informs each process in $g \cup h$ when $g \cap h$ is faulty. The
second variation requires a message to be delivered when the destination group
runs in isolation. We prove that its weakest failure detector is at least $\mu
\wedge (\wedge_{g, h \in G}~\Omega_{g \cap h})$. This value is attained when
$F=\varnothing$.

retrieves supporting evidences and the latter examines them to produce answers.
Recently, the reader component has witnessed significant advances with the help
of large-scale pre-trained generative models. Meanwhile most existing solutions
in the search component rely on the traditional ``index-retrieve-then-rank''
pipeline, which suffers from large memory footprint and difficulty in
end-to-end optimization. Inspired by recent efforts in constructing model-based
IR models, we propose to replace the traditional multi-step search pipeline
with a novel single-step generative model, which can dramatically simplify the
search process and be optimized in an end-to-end manner. We show that a strong
generative retrieval model can be learned with a set of adequately designed
pre-training tasks, and be adopted to improve a variety of downstream KILT
tasks with further fine-tuning. We name the pre-trained generative retrieval
model as CorpusBrain as all information about the corpus is encoded in its
parameters without the need of constructing additional index. Empirical results
show that CorpusBrain can significantly outperform strong baselines for the
retrieval task on the KILT benchmark and establish new state-of-the-art

slices for accurate diagnosis. Deformable image registration is a necessary
technique for fusing multi-modal pathology slices. This paper proposes a hybrid
deep feature-based deformable image registration framework for stained
pathology samples. We first extract dense feature points via the detector-based
and detector-free deep learning feature networks and perform points matching.
Then, to further reduce false matches, an outlier detection method combining
the isolation forest statistical model and the local affine correction model is
proposed. Finally, the interpolation method generates the deformable vector
field for pathology image registration based on the above matching points. We
evaluate our method on the dataset of the Non-rigid Histology Image
Registration (ANHIR) challenge, which is co-organized with the IEEE ISBI 2019
conference. Our technique outperforms the traditional approaches by 17% with
the Average-Average registration target error (rTRE) reaching 0.0034. The
proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance and ranked 1st in
evaluating the test dataset. The proposed hybrid deep feature-based
registration method can potentially become a reliable method for pathology
image registration.

fundamental plane (FP) of ETGs is not a plane in the strict sense but is a
curved surface with a twisted shape whose orthogonal direction to the surface
is shifted as the central velocity dispersion ($\sigma_0$) or mean surface
brightness within the half-light radius ($\mu_e$) changes. When ETGs are
divided into subsamples according to $\sigma_0$, the coefficient of $\mu_e$ of
the FP increases, whereas the zero-point of the FP decreases at higher
$\sigma_0$. Taking the $z$ band as an example, the coefficient of $\mu_e$ rises
from $0.28$ to $0.36$ as $\sigma_0$ increases from $\sim100$ to $\sim300$ km
s$^{-1}$. At the same time, the zero-point of the FP falls from $-7.5$ to
$-9.0$ in the same $\sigma_0$ range. The consistent picture on the curved
nature of the FP is also reached by inspecting changes in the FP coefficients
for ETG subsamples with different $\mu_e$. By examining scaling relations that
are projections of the FP, we suggest that the warped nature of the FP may
originate from dry merger effects that are imprinted more prominently in ETGs
with higher masses.

discriminate input and generate samples, significantly reducing their memory

decentralized fault-tolerance method called DRAGON that runs simulations (as

the edge federation. Extensive experiments with real-world edge computing

that DRAGON can outperform the baseline methods in fault-detection and Quality
of Service (QoS) metrics. Specifically, the proposed method gives higher F1
scores for fault-detection than the best deep learning (DL) method, while

in energy consumption, response time and service level agreement violations by
up to 74, 63 and 82 percent, respectively.

thus be swept into ICME-driven sheath regions. They may also be generated
locally within the sheaths through a range of processes. This work applies
wavelet analysis to obtain the normalized reduced magnetic helicity, normalized
cross helicity, and normalized residual energy, and uses them to identify
small-scale flux ropes and Alfv\'en waves in 55 ICME-driven sheath regions
observed by the Wind spacecraft in the near-Earth solar wind. Their occurrence
is investigated separately for three different frequency ranges between
$10^{-2} - 10^{-4}$ Hz. We find that small scale flux ropes are more common in
ICME sheaths than in the upstream wind, implying that they are at least to some
extent actively generated in the sheath and not just compressed from the
upstream wind. Alfv\'en waves occur more evenly in the upstream wind and in the
sheath. This study also reveals that while the highest frequency (smallest
scale) flux ropes occur relatively evenly across the sheath, the lower
frequency (largest scale) flux ropes peak near the ICME leading edge. This
suggests that they could have different physical origins, and that processes
near the ICME leading edge are important for generating the larger scale

by CLIP to early fuse with audio and motion features extracted from videos,
obtaining audio-visual fusion features and motion-visual fusion features
respectively. Multi-modal alignment problem is also considered in this process.
Then, visual features, audio-visual fusion features, motion-visual fusion

with caption queries in a multi-level way. Finally, the retrieval outputs from
all levels are late fused to obtain final text-video retrieval results. Our

environmental physical changes along the temporal evolution. The investigation
outcome hints at a layered structure of interstellar ices with mainly H$_2$O in
the inner layers and an increasing amount of CO near the surface. The
morphology of interstellar ice analogues can be investigated experimentally.
Aims. This research presents a new approach of a three-dimensional fit where
observational results are first fitted with a gas-grain chemical model. Then,
based on the numerical results the laboratory IR spectra are recorded for
interstellar ice analogues in a layered and in a mixed morphology. These
results can then be compared with future James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
observations. Special attention is paid to the inclusion of the IR inactive
species N$_2$ and O$_2$. Methods. Ice analogue spectra containing the most
abundant predicted molecules were recorded at a temperature of 10 K using a
Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. In the case of layered ice we
deposited a H$_2$O-CO-N$_2$-O$_2$ mixture on top of a H2O-CH$_3$OH-N$_2$ ice,
while in the case of mixed ice we examined a H$_2$O-CH$_3$OH-N$_2$-CO
composition. Results. Following the changing composition and structure of the
ice, we find differences in the absorption bands for most of the examined
vibrational modes. The extent of observed changes in the IR band profiles will
allow us to analyse the structure of ice mantles in L1544 from future
observations by the JWST. Conclusions. The comparison of our spectroscopic
measurements with upcoming JWST observations is crucial in order to put
stringent constraints on the chemical and physical structure of dust icy
mantles, and to explain surface chemistry.

multilevel converters (MMC) considering light load conditions. The prior-art
fault location methods of the MMC are often developed and verified under full
load conditions. However, it is revealed that the faulty arm current will be
suppressed to be unipolar when the open-circuit fault happens on the submodule
switch under light load. This leads to the capacitor voltage of the healthy and
faulty submodules rising or falling with the same variations, increasing the
difficulty of fault location. The proposed approach of injecting the
second-order circulating current will rebuild the bipolar arm current of the
MMC and enlarge the capacitor voltage deviations between the healthy and faulty
SMs. As a result, the fault location time is significantly shortened. The
simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach, showing that the fault location time is reduced to 1/6 compared with
the condition without second-order circulating current injection.

(FL) enables global model training across clients without compromising their
confidential local data. However, existing FL methods suffer from the problem
of low inference performance for unevenly distributed data, since most of them
rely on Federated Averaging (FedAvg)-based aggregation. By averaging model
parameters in a coarse manner, FedAvg eclipses the individual characteristics
of local models, which strongly limits the inference capability of FL. Worse
still, in each round of FL training, FedAvg dispatches the same initial local
models to clients, which can easily result in stuck-at-local-search for optimal
global models. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel and
effective FL paradigm named FedMR (Federating Model Recombination). Unlike
conventional FedAvg-based methods, the cloud server of FedMR shuffles each
layer of collected local models and recombines them to achieve new models for
local training on clients. Due to the fine-grained model recombination and
local training in each FL round, FedMR can quickly figure out one globally
optimal model for all the clients. Comprehensive experimental results
demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art FL methods, FedMR can
significantly improve the inference accuracy without causing extra
communication overhead.

framework of the classical model of stochastic reorientations in an asymmetric
double well potential (ADWP). In the nonlinear regime, this model exhibits some
pecularities in the static response. We find that the saturation behavior of
the symmetric double well potential model does not follow the Langevin function
and only in the linear regime the standard results are recovered. If a finite
asymmetry is assumed, the nonlinear susceptibilities are found to change the
sign at a number of characteristic temperatures that depend on the magnitude of
the asymmetry, as has been observed earlier for the third-order and the
fifth-order response. If the kinetics of the barrier crossing in the ADWP model
is described as a two-state model, we can give analytical expressions for the
values of the characteristic temperatures. The results for the response
obtained from a (numerical) solution of the Fokker-Planck equation for the
Brownian motion in a model ADWP behaves very similar to the two-state model for
high barriers. For small barriers no clearcut time scale separation between the
barrier crossing process and the intra-well relaxation exists and the model
exhibits a number of time scales. In this case, the frequency-dependent linear
susceptibility at low temperatures is dominated by the fast intra-well
transitions and at higher temperatures by the barrier crossing kinetics. We
find that for nonlinear susceptibilities the latter process appears to be more
important and the intra-well transitions play only role at the lowest
temperatures.

  revealing Schur-Weyl duality","26 pages",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is a well-established fact in quantum information theory, that uniform
averaging over the collective action of a unitary group on a multipartite
quantum state projects the state to a form equivalent to a permutation operator
of the subsystems. Hence states equivalent to permutation operators are
untouched by collective unitary noise. A trivial observation shows that uniform
averaging over permutation operators projects the state into a form with
block-diagonal structure equivalent to the one of the collective action of the
unitary group. We introduce a name for this property: duality of averaging. The
mathematical reason behind this duality is the fact that the collective action
of the unitary group on the tensor product state space of a multipartite
quantum system and the action of the permutation operations are mutual
commutants when treated as matrix algebras. Such pairs of matrix algebras are
known as dual reductive pairs. In this work we show, that in the case of finite
dimensional quantum systems such duality of averaging holds for any pairs of
symmetry groups being dual reductive pairs, regardless of whether they are
compact or not, as long as the averaging operation is defined via iterated
integral over the Cartan decomposition of the group action. Although our result
is very general, we focus much attention on the concrete example of a dual
reductive pair consisting of collective action of special linear matrices and
permutation operations, which physically corresponds to averaging multipartite
quantum states over non-unitary SLOCC-type (Stochastic Local Operations and
Classical Communication) operations. In this context we show, that noiseless
subsystems known from collective unitary averaging persist in the case of SLOCC
averaging in a conditional way: upon postselection to specific invariant
subspaces.

{\sim}10 years apart, we measure the forward shock (FS) proper motions (PMs) at
231 rim locations. The average shock radius and velocity are 3.66 {\pm} 0.036
pc and 6315 {\pm} 310 km s{^{-1}}. Hydrodynamic simulations, recast as
similarity solutions, provide models for the remnant's expansion into a uniform
ambient medium. These are coupled to a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis
to determine explosion parameters, constrained by the FS measurements. For
specific global parameters, the MCMC posterior distributions yield an age of
315.5 {\pm} 1.8 yr, a dynamical explosion center at 5h09m31s.16s
-67{^\circ}31{^\prime}17.1{^{\prime\prime}} and ambient medium densities at
each azimuth ranging from 3.7-8.0 {\times} 10{^{-25}} g cm{^{-3}}. We can
detect stellar PMs corresponding to speeds in the LMC of 770 km s{^{-1}} or
more using the H${\alpha}$ images. Five stars in the remnant show measurable
PMs but none appear to be moving radially from the center, including a
prominent red star 4.6{^{\prime\prime}} from the center. Using coronal [Fe XIV]
{\lambda}5303 emission as a proxy for the reverse shock location, we constrain
the explosion energy (for a compression factor of 4) to a value of E = (1.30
{\pm} 0.41) {\times} 10{^{51}} erg for the first time from shock kinematics
alone. Higher compression factors (7 or more) are strongly disfavored based on
multiple criteria, arguing for inefficient particle acceleration in the Balmer

built, taking into account the self-consistent gravitational field in

momentum flux density tensor should include the analog of the anisotropic
pressure tensor and the second correlation moment of both longitudinal and
transverse gravitational field strength. The non-relativistic temporal equation
for the second correlation moment of the gravitational field strength is
derived from the Einstein equations using the first-order post-Newtonian

oscillations are found in a homogeneous and isotropic star cloud. The
requirement for the velocity of transverse oscillations to be zero provides the
boundary condition for the stability of the cloud. The critical radius of the
spherical cloud of stars is obtained, which is precisely consistent with the

(AIS) remains one of the most effective methods for marginal likelihood
estimation. It relies on a sequence of distributions interpolating between a
tractable initial distribution and the target distribution of interest which we
simulate from approximately using a non-homogeneous Markov chain. To obtain an
importance sampling estimate of the marginal likelihood, AIS introduces an
extended target distribution to reweight the Markov chain proposal. While much
effort has been devoted to improving the proposal distribution used by AIS, an
underappreciated issue is that AIS uses a convenient but suboptimal extended
target distribution. We here leverage recent progress in score-based generative
modeling (SGM) to approximate the optimal extended target distribution
minimizing the variance of the marginal likelihood estimate for AIS proposals
corresponding to the discretization of Langevin and Hamiltonian dynamics. We
demonstrate these novel, differentiable, AIS procedures on a number of
synthetic benchmark distributions and variational auto-encoders.

realistic images, much recent work has made progress in enhancing underexposed
images globally. However, the local image enhancement approach has not been
explored, although they are requisite in the real-world scenario, e.g., fixing
local underexposure. In this work, we define a new task setting for
underexposed image enhancement where users are able to control which region to
be enlightened with an input mask. As indicated by the mask, an image can be
divided into three areas, including Masked Area A, Transition Area B, and
Unmasked Area C. As a result, Area A should be enlightened to the desired
lighting, and there shall be a smooth transition (Area B) from the enlightened
area (Area A) to the unchanged region (Area C). To finish this task, we propose
two methods: Concatenate the mask as additional channels (MConcat), Mask-based
Normlization (MNorm). While MConcat simply append the mask channels to the
input images, MNorm can dynamically enhance the spatial-varying pixels,
guaranteeing the enhanced images are consistent with the requirement indicated
by the input mask. Moreover, MConcat serves as a play-and-plug module, and can
be incorporated with existing networks, which globally enhance images, to
achieve the local enhancement. And the overall network can be trained with
three kinds of loss functions in Area A, Area B, and Area C, which are unified
for various model structures. We perform extensive experiments on public
datasets with various parametric approaches for low-light enhancement, %the
Convolutional-Neutral-Network-based model and Transformer-based model,

are implemented. In terms of compact reconstruction, 5th-order normal

non-compact reconstruction and compact reconstruction for ILES. The accuracy of
HGKS is verified by numerical simulation of three-dimensional advection of
density perturbation. For the non-compact 7th-order scheme, 16 Gaussian points
are required on the cell interface to preserve the order of accuracy. Then,
HGKS with non-compact and compact reconstruction is used in the
three-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex (TGV) problem and turbulent channel
flows. Accurate ILES solutions have been obtained from HGKS. In terms of the
physical modeling underlying the numerical algorithms, the compact
reconstruction has the consistent physical and numerical domains of dependence
without employing additional information from cells which have no any direct
physical connection with the targeted cell. The compact GKS shows a favorable

constructs an output space adversarial learning scheme to bridge the domain
distribution discrepancy between source domain and target domain and to narrow
the influence of domain shift. Specifically, we embed an invariant feature
memory module to store invariant domain-level context information because the
features obtained from adversarial learning only tend to represent the variant
feature of current limited inputs. This module is integrated by a category
attention-driven invariant domain-level context aggregation module to current
pseudo invariant feature for further augmenting the pixel representations. An
entropy-based pseudo label filtering strategy is used to update the memory
module with high-confident pseudo invariant feature of current target images.
Extensive experiments under three cross-domain tasks indicate that our proposed

whether the resource to solve $n$ communication problems together is
(approximately) the sum of resources to solve these problems separately. Our
work starts with the observation that Meir and Dinur's fortification lemma for
protocol size over rectangles can be generalized to a general fortification
lemma for a sub-additive measure over set. By applying this lemma to the case
of cover number, we obtain a dual form of cover number, called
``$\delta$-fooling set'' which is a generalized fooling set. Given a
communication problem $S\subseteq (X\times Y) \times Z$, let $\Lambda \subseteq
X\times Y$ be a $\delta$-fooling set of $S$, then given any subset
$\tilde{\Lambda} \subseteq \Lambda$ such that $|\tilde{\Lambda}|/{|\Lambda|} >
\delta$, there is no monochromatic rectangle that covers the subset
$\tilde{\Lambda}$. Particularly, there is a $\frac{16\log|X| |Y|}{\mathsf{
Cov}(S)}$-fooling set of communication problem $S$. With this fact, we are able
to reprove the classic direct sum theorem of cover number with a simple double
counting argument. And we prove a new direct sum theorem about protocol size
which imply a better direct sum theorem for two functions in terms of protocol
size. Formally, let $\mathsf{L}$ denote the protocol szie, given a
communication problem $F:A \times B \rightarrow

the key step to select the interpolation sampling points in interpolative
separable density fitting (ISDF) decomposition. Real-valued K-means clustering
for accelerating the ISDF decomposition has been demonstrated for large-scale
hybrid functional ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) within plane-wave basis
sets where the Kohn-Sham orbitals are real-valued. However, it is unclear
whether such K-means clustering works for complex-valued Kohn-Sham orbitals.
Here, we apply the K-means clustering into AIMD for complex-valued Kohn-Sham
orbitals and use an improved weight function defined as the sum of the square
modulus of complex-valued Kohn-Sham orbitals in K-means clustering. Numerical
results demonstrate that this improved weight function in K-means clustering
algorithm yields smoother and more delocalized interpolation sampling points,
resulting in smoother energy potential, smaller energy drift and longer time
steps for AIMD compared to the previous weight function used in the real-valued
K-means algorithm. In particular, we find that this improved algorithm can
obtain more accurate oxygen-oxygen radial distribution functions in liquid
water molecules compared to the previous K-means algorithm. Finally, we
describe a massively parallel implementation of this ISDF decomposition to
accelerate large-scale complex-valued hybrid DFT calculations containing
thousands of atoms (2,744 atoms), which can scale up to 5,504 CPU cores on
modern heterogeneous supercomputers.

increasingly diverse nature of qubits, we theoretically study the influence
that quenched outside disturbances have in an intermediately long time limit.
We consider localized imperfections, uniform fields, noise, and couplings to an
environment which we study in a unified framework using a prototypical but
idealized interacting quantum device - the Kitaev honeycomb model. Our study
focuses on the quantum state robustness in response to an outside magnetic
field, a magnetic bath, magnetic noise, magnetic impurities, and a noisy
impurity. As indicators for quantum robustness, we use the Uhlmann fidelty of
the ground state and excited spinon states after a quench. We find that the
time dependence of the fidelity often depends crucially on whether the system
is gapped. We find that in the gapped case the fidelity decays to a constant
value under noiseless quenches, while in a gapless system it exhibits algebraic
decay. In all other situations studied, such as coupling to a bath and noisy
quenches, both gapped and gapless systems exhibit a universal form for the
long-time fidelity, $Ce^{-\alpha t}t^{-\beta}$, where the values of $C$,
$\alpha$, and $\beta$ depend on physical parameters such as system size,
disturbance strength, etc. Therefore, our work provides estimates for the
intermediate-long time stability of a quantum device and it suggests under what
conditions there appear the hallmarks of an orthogonality catastrophe in the
time-dependence of the fidelity. Our work provides engineering guidelines for
quantum devices in quench design and system size.

create supervisory signals to real-world tasks, avoiding the extensive cost of
labeling. SSL is particularly attractive for unsupervised tasks such as anomaly
detection (AD), where labeled anomalies are costly to secure, difficult to
simulate, or even nonexistent. A large catalog of augmentation functions have
been used for SSL-based AD (SSAD) on image data, and recent works have observed
that the type of augmentation has a significant impact on performance.
Motivated by those, this work sets out to put image-based SSAD under a larger
lens and carefully investigate the role of data augmentation in AD through
extensive experiments on three different models across 420 different tasks. Our
main finding is that self-supervision acts as a yet-another model
hyperparameter and should be chosen carefully in regard to the nature of true
anomalies. That is, the alignment between data augmentation and the underlying
anomaly-generating mechanism in given data is the key to the success of SSAD,
and in the lack thereof, SSL even impairs (!) the accuracy. Moving beyond
proposing another SSAD method, our study contributes to a better understanding
of this growing area and lays out new directions for future research.

light field image (LFI) embeds abundant 3D structure and texture information of
the target scene by recording the direction and position of each incident ray
via a plenoptic camera. LFIs are becoming popular in the computer vision and
graphics communities. However, making full use of the abundant information
available from LFIs, such as 2D array of sub-views and the disparity map of
each sub-view, for effective rain removal is still a challenging problem. In
this paper, we propose a novel method, 4D-MGP-SRRNet, for rain streak removal
from LFIs. Our method takes as input all sub-views of a rainy LFI. To make full

to detect high-resolution rain streaks from all sub-views of the input LFI at

detect rain streaks by training on both virtual-world rainy LFIs and real-world
rainy LFIs at multi-scales via computing pseudo ground truths for real-world
rain streaks. We then feed all sub-views subtracting the predicted rain streaks
into a 4D convolution-based Depth Estimation Residual Network (DERNet) to
estimate the depth maps, which are later converted into fog maps. Finally, all
sub-views concatenated with the corresponding rain streaks and fog maps are fed
into a powerful rainy LFI restoring model based on the adversarial recurrent
neural network to progressively eliminate rain streaks and recover the

test-time adaptation continues to update the initial source model during
deployment. A promising direction are methods based on self-training which have
been shown to be well suited for gradual domain adaptation, since reliable
pseudo-labels can be provided. In this work, we address two problems that exist
when applying self-training in the setting of test-time adaptation. First,
adapting a model to long test sequences that contain multiple domains can lead
to error accumulation. Second, naturally, not all shifts are gradual in
practice. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GTTA. By creating artificial
intermediate domains that divide the current domain shift into a more gradual
one, effective self-training through high quality pseudo-labels can be
performed. To create the intermediate domains, we propose two independent
variations: mixup and light-weight style transfer. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on the continual and gradual corruption
benchmarks, as well as ImageNet-R. To further investigate gradual shifts in the
context of urban scene segmentation, we publish a new benchmark: CarlaTTA. It
enables the exploration of several non-stationary domain shifts.

method based on hidden feature analysis, which discovers spatio-temporal

design an algorithm of rational uniform consensus with general omission
failures under the assumption that processes are controlled by rational agents
and prefer consensus. Different from crashing one, agent with omission failures
may crash, or omit to send or receive messages when it should, which leads to
difficulty of detecting faulty agents. By combining the possible failures of
agents at the both ends of a link, we convert omission failure model into link
state model to make faulty detection possible. Through analyzing message
passing mechanism in the distributed system with n agents, among which t agents
may commit omission failures, we provide the upper bound on message passing
time for reaching consensus on a state among nonfaulty agents, and message
chain mechanism for validating messages. And then we prove our rational uniform
consensus is a Nash equilibrium when n>2t+1, and failure patterns and initial
preferences are blind (an assumption of randomness). Thus agents could have no
motivation to deviate the consensus. Our research strengthens the reliability

types of network coding techniques have been proposed to reduce the impact of
losses by transmitting redundant information, they are not widely used. Some
niche applications include their own variant of Forward Erasure Correction

newly standardized QUIC protocol. With FlEC, an application can easily select
the reliability mechanism that meets its requirements, from pure
retransmissions to various forms of FEC. We consider three different use cases:

full non-linear time-history analyses. Within this perimeter, there are two
main approaches: the first relies on the selection and scaling of recorded
ground motions; the second, based on random vibration theory, characterizes the
seismic input with a parametric stochastic ground motion model (SGMM). The
latter case has the great advantage that the problem of seismic risk analysis
is framed as a forward uncertainty quantification problem. However, running
classical full-scale Monte Carlo simulations is intractable because of the
prohibitive computational cost of typical finite element models. Therefore, it
is of great interest to define fragility models that link an EDP of interest
with the SGMM parameters -- which are regarded as IMs in this context. The
computation of such fragility models is a challenge on its own and, despite few
recent studies, there is still an important research gap in this domain. This

importance and ubiquity of online education. Among the major advantages of
e-learning is not only improving students' learning experience and widening
their educational prospects, but also an opportunity to gain insights into
students' learning processes with learning analytics. This study contributes to
the topic of improving and understanding e-learning processes in the following
ways. First, we demonstrate that accurate predictive models can be built based
on sequential patterns derived from students' behavioral data, which are able
to identify underperforming students early in the course. Second, we
investigate the specificity-generalizability trade-off in building such
predictive models by investigating whether predictive models should be built
for every course individually based on course-specific sequential patterns, or
across several courses based on more general behavioral patterns. Finally, we
present a methodology for capturing temporal aspects in behavioral data and
analyze its influence on the predictive performance of the models. The results
of our improved sequence classification technique are capable to predict
student performance with high levels of accuracy, reaching 90 percent for
course-specific models.

First, we propose a type of novel GSMPPM constellations that intelligently

gains over their counterparts. Therefore, the proposed PLDPC-coded GSMPPM
system with ADM constellations is competent to satisfy the high-reliability

similar problem arises in general relativity for Lorentzian manifolds instead
of functions on $\mathbb{R}^m$. It is well-known, however, that even if the
extension of a Lorentzian manifold $(M,g)$ is analytic, various choices are in
general possible at the boundary. This paper establishes a uniqueness condition
for extensions of globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds $(M,g)$ with a focus
on low regularities: any two extensions which are anchored by an inextendible
causal curve $\gamma : [-1,0) \to M$ in the sense that $\gamma$ has limit

transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to target domains without their

addresses class-wise conditional alignment. In TPN, while the closeness of
class centers between source and target domains is explicitly enforced in a
latent space, the underlying fine-grained subtype structure and the
cross-domain within-class compactness have not been fully investigated. To
counter this, we propose a new approach to adaptively perform a fine-grained
subtype-aware alignment to improve performance in the target domain without the
subtype label in both domains. The insight of our approach is that the
unlabeled subtypes in a class have the local proximity within a subtype, while
exhibiting disparate characteristics, because of different conditional and
label shifts. Specifically, we propose to simultaneously enforce subtype-wise
compactness and class-wise separation, by utilizing intermediate pseudo-labels.
In addition, we systematically investigate various scenarios with and without
prior knowledge of subtype numbers, and propose to exploit the underlying
subtype structure. Furthermore, a dynamic queue framework is developed to
evolve the subtype cluster centroids steadily using an alternative processing
scheme. Experimental results, carried out with multi-view congenital heart

our subtype-aware UDA, compared with state-of-the-art UDA methods.

continues within the time budget. Furthermore, to handle fluctuations in task

proposed to synchronize execution status and re-assign unfinished subtasks
dynamically to maintain correctness and optimality. Both algorithms are
validated rigorously over large-scale systems via numerical simulations and

introducing fractional deformation parameters. We use PCA to construct the
`best-measured' linear combinations of the PN deformation parameters from the

possible beyond-GR physics. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of this
method with the proposed next-generation gravitational wave detectors, Cosmic
Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET). Observation of compact binaries with
total masses between 20-200 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ in the detector frame and at a
luminosity distance of 500 Mpc, CE can measure the three most dominant linear
combinations to an accuracy better than 10%, and the most dominant one to
better than 0.1%. For specific ranges of masses and linear combinations,
constraints from ET are better by a few factors than CE. This improvement is
because of the improved low frequency sensitivity of ET compared to CE (between
1-5 Hz). In addition, we explain the sensitivity of the PCA parameters to the
different PN deformation parameters and discuss their variation with total
mass. We also discuss a criterion for quantifying the number of most dominant
linear combinations that capture the information in the signal up to a

demonstrate efficient optical parametric oscillators based on silicon nitride
photonics that address frequencies between 260 THz (1150 nm) and 510 THz (590
nm). Pumping silicon nitride microrings near 385 THz (780 nm) yields
monochromatic signal and idler waves with unprecedented output powers in this
wavelength range. We estimate on-chip output powers (separately for the signal
and idler) between 1 mW and 5 mW and conversion efficiencies reaching
approximately 15 %. Underlying this improved performance is our development of
pulley waveguides for broadband near-critical coupling, which exploits a
fundamental connection between the waveguide-resonator coupling rate and
conversion efficiency. Finally, we find that mode competition reduces
conversion efficiency at high pump powers, thereby constraining the maximum
realizable output power. Our work proves that optical parametric oscillators
built with integrated photonics can produce useful amounts of visible laser
light with high efficiency.

we present a generalized and comparative description of the phenomenon of total
internal reflection (TIR) at different dynamic interfaces. Such interfaces
include, beyond the classical interfaces corresponding to the boundaries of
moving bodies (moving interface -- moving matter systems), interfaces formed by
a traveling-wave step modulation of an electromagnetic parameter (e.g.,
refractive index) (moving interface -- stationary matter systems) and fixed
interfaces between moving-matter media (stationary interface -- moving matter
systems). We first resolve the problem using the evanescence of the transmitted
wave as the criterion for TIR and applying the conventional technique of
relative frame hopping (between the laboratory and rest frames), which results
in closed-form formulas for the relevant critical (incidence, reflection, phase
refraction and power refraction) angles. We then introduce the concept of
catch-up limit between the dynamic interface and the transmitted wave as an
alternative criterion for the critical angle. We use this approach both to
analytically verify the critical angle formulas, further validated by full-wave
(FDTD) analysis, and to explain the related physics, using Fresnel-Fizeau drag
and spacetime frequency transition considerations. These results might find
various applications in ultra-fast optics, gravity analogs and quantum

different values of initial angular momentum per mass ratio. We employed the
most generic search for short-duration transients in O3 to evaluate the search
sensitivity in this parameter space for a wide range in total mass in terms of
visible spacetime volume. From the visible spacetime volume we determine for
the first time the merger rate upper limit of such systems. The most stringent

$0.2~\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for an equal mass $200~M_\odot$

by the advances in scientific machine learning. Data-driven methods such as
Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) can extract coherent structures from
spatio-temporal data generated from dynamical systems and infer different
scenarios for said systems. The spatio-temporal data comes as snapshots
containing spatial information for each time instant. In modern engineering
applications, the generation of high-dimensional snapshots can be time and/or
resource-demanding. In the present study, we consider two strategies for
enhancing DMD workflow in large numerical simulations: (i) snapshots
compression to relieve disk pressure; (ii) the use of in situ visualization
images to reconstruct the dynamics (or part of) in runtime. We evaluate our
approaches with two 3D fluid dynamics simulations and consider DMD to
reconstruct the solutions. Results reveal that snapshot compression
considerably reduces the required disk space. We have observed that lossy
compression reduces storage by almost $50\%$ with low relative errors in the
signal reconstructions and other quantities of interest. We also extend our
analysis to data generated on-the-fly, using in-situ visualization tools to
generate image files of our state vectors during runtime. On large simulations,
the generation of snapshots may be slow enough to use batch algorithms for
inference. Streaming DMD takes advantage of the incremental SVD algorithm and
updates the modes with the arrival of each new snapshot. We use streaming DMD
to reconstruct the dynamics from in-situ generated images. We show that this
process is efficient, and the reconstructed dynamics are accurate.

a Delta II rocket starting an ambitious journey to Vesta and Ceres, the two
most massive worlds in the largest reservoir of asteroids in the Solar System,
the Main Belt. Prior to the Dawn launch, Earth-bound observations of Vesta and
Ceres revealed intriguing features--from Vesta's rugged shape to Ceres' tenuous
water exosphere--, but these objects remained fuzzy speckles of light even
through the lenses of the most powerful telescopes. With Dawn's exploration of
Vesta (2011-2012) and Ceres (2015-2018) these two worlds came into focus.
Breath-taking details emerged of how large collisions sculpted Vesta liberating
massive amounts of material in the inner Main Belt, providing the source of an
important family of meteorites recovered on Earth. Ceres' complex geology,
which may rival that of the Earth and Mars, unveiled recent cryovolcanic
activity. This book is dedicated to these highlights, and many more discoveries
of the Dawn mission. By the time Dawn completed its mission in 2018, our
understanding of the formation of the Solar System had greatly evolved thanks
to new theoretical models and to a new trove of meteorite geochemical data, and
Dawn observations of Vesta and Ceres provide new, vital constraints to
synergistically interpret models and data. The broader implications of the Dawn
legacy are presented in a series of dedicated chapters. The editors hope this
book will serve as a solid reference for the younger generations as well as for
more seasoned researchers to successfully pursue future exploration of the Main
Belt. We certainly have learned a lot thanks to Dawn, and yet we know that we
have barely scratched the surface of what Main Belt asteroids can tell us about
the dawn of our Solar System.

  Model","SPIE Medical Imaging 2022: Image Processing",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG eess.IV eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to transfer
knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain to counter
the difficulty of labeling in a new domain. The training of conventional

data. However, privacy of the large-scale and well-labeled data in the source
domain and trained model parameters can become the major concern of cross
center/domain collaborations. In this work, to address this, we propose a
practical solution to UDA for segmentation with a black-box segmentation model
trained in the source domain only, rather than original source data or a
white-box source model. Specifically, we resort to a knowledge distillation
scheme with exponential mixup decay (EMD) to gradually learn target-specific
representations. In addition, unsupervised entropy minimization is further
applied to regularization of the target domain confidence. We evaluated our
framework on the BraTS 2018 database, achieving performance on par with

The
system is reported to contain a very massive O supergiant donor and a massive

metal-poor galaxy M33 make it a unique laboratory for studying the winds of
metal-poor donor stars with black hole companions and it helps us to understand
the potential progenitors of black hole mergers. Using phase-resolved
simultaneous HST- and XMM-Newton-observations, we traced the interaction of the
stellar wind with the black hole. Our comprehensive spectroscopic investigation
of the donor star (X-ray+UV+optical) yields new stellar and wind parameters for
the system that differs significantly from previous estimates. In particular,
the masses of the components are considerably reduced to 38 for the O-star
donor and 11.4 for the black hole. The O giant is overfilling its Roche lobe
and shows surface He enrichment. The donor shows a densely clumped wind with a
mass-loss rate that matches theoretical predictions. We investigated the
wind-driving contributions from different ions and the changes in the
ionization structure due to X-ray illumination. Toward the black hole, the wind
is strongly quenched due to strong X-ray illumination. For this system, the
standard wind-fed accretion scenario alone cannot explain the observed X-ray
luminosity, pointing toward an additional mass overflow, which is in line with
our acceleration calculations. The X-ray photoionization creates an He II
emission region emitting $10^{47}$ ph/s. We computed binary evolutionary tracks
for the system using MESA. Currently, the system is transitioning toward an
unstable mass transfer phase, resulting in a common envelope of the black hole
and donor. Since the mass ratio is q~3.3 and the period is short, the system is
unlikely to survive the common envelope, but will rather merge.

angular distribution of the radio sources in the TGSS catalog. To do so, we
cross-correlate the angular position of the radio sources with the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) lensing maps from the Planck satellite, since
cross-correlation is expected to be insensitive to source of possible
systematic errors that may generate a spurious clustering signal. The amplitude
of the angular cross-correlation spectrum of TGSS-CMB lensing turns out to be
much smaller than that of the TGSS auto-spectrum and consistent with that of
the NVSS-CMB lensing cross spectrum. A result that confirms the spurious origin
of the TGSS large scale clustering signal. We further compare the two
cross-spectra with theoretical predictions that use various prescriptions from
the literature, for the redshift counts of the radio sources, $N(z)$, and their
bias $b(z)$. These models, that assume a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and that were
proposed to fit the NVSS auto-spectrum, fail to match the cross-spectra on
large scale, though not by far. When the bias relation is let free to vary
(model predictions are rather insensitive to the choice of the N(z)) the
quality of the fit improves but a large bias ($ b_g = 2.53 \pm 0.11$) is
required, which does not seem to be consistent with the observed clustering
amplitude of the radio sources in the local universe. Whether this large
cross-correlation amplitude represents a problem for the radio sources models,
or for the $\Lambda$CDM framework itself, can only be clarified using next
generation datasets featuring large number of objects. What our analysis does
show is the possibility to remove the $N(z)$ and $b(z)$ degeneracy by combining
angular and cross-correlation analyses.

Rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks generate continuous and
piecewise-linear (CPWL) mappings and are the state-of-the-art approach for
solving regression problems. In this paper, we propose an alternative method
that leverages the expressivity of CPWL functions. In contrast to deep neural
networks, our CPWL parameterization guarantees stability and is interpretable.
Our approach relies on the partitioning of the domain of the CPWL function by a
Delaunay triangulation. The function values at the vertices of the
triangulation are our learnable parameters and identify the CPWL function
uniquely. Formulating the learning scheme as a variational problem, we use the
Hessian total variation (HTV) as regularizer to favor CPWL functions with few
affine pieces. In this way, we control the complexity of our model through a
single hyperparameter. By developing a computational framework to compute the
HTV of any CPWL function parameterized by a triangulation, we discretize the
learning problem as the generalized least absolute shrinkage and selection
operator (LASSO). Our experiments validate the usage of our method in
low-dimensional scenarios.

real-world systems can be abstracted as complex networks each consisting of
many functional nodes and edges. Percolation theory has indicated that removing
only a few vital nodes can cause the collapse of whole network. However,
finding the least number of such vital nodes is a rather challenging task for
large networks due to its NP-hardness. Previous studies have proposed many
centrality measures and heuristic algorithms to tackle this network dismantling

by designing a neural model which can be trained from tiny synthetic networks

mission at first sight, as network sizes and topologies are quite different
across distinct real-world networks. Nonetheless, this article initiates
insightful efforts of designing and training a neural influence ranking model
(NIRM). Experiments on fifteen real-world networks validate its effectiveness
for its mostly requiring fewer vital nodes to dismantle a network, compared
with the state-of-the-art competitors. The key to its success lies in that our

UCHII regions in the 6 GHz image, 39 of which are also detected at 22.4 GHz.
Eight of the 54 UCHII regions are newly discovered. The UCHII regions have
radii between $0.006 {\rm pc}$ and $0.04 {\rm pc}$, and have emission measure
between $10^{6} {\rm pc\,cm^{-6}}$ and $10^{9} {\rm pc\,cm^{-6}}$. The UCHII

density of $\sim10^6-10^9 {\rm cm^{-3}}$ around the UCHII regions. The pressure
of the UCHII regions and the dense gas surrounding them are comparable. The
expansion timescale of these UCHII regions is determined to be $\sim10^4-10^5

associated with outflows. The electron densities of the UCHII regions we
identified are in agreement with that of typical UCHII regions, while the radii
are smaller than those of the typical UCHII regions. The dust cores in SgrB2(N)
are more evolved than in SgrB2(DS) but younger than in SgrB2(M).

linear classification problems remain. By introducing the information

demonstrated its power to solve these challenges. In this paper, we further
improve IB-IRM from two aspects. First, we show that the key assumption of

guarantee of OOD generalization and it is still possible to achieve the optimal
solution without this assumption. Second, we illustrate two failure modes that
IB-IRM (and IRM) could fail for learning the invariant features, and to address
such failures, we propose a \textit{Counterfactual Supervision-based
Information Bottleneck (CSIB)} learning algorithm that provably recovers the
invariant features. By requiring counterfactual inference, CSIB works even when
accessing data from a single environment. Empirical experiments on several

exact categories previously, were developed to produce examples of standardly
stratified algebras. A stratifying system $\Phi$ is a finite set of objects
satisfying some orthogonality conditions. One very interesting property is that
the subcategory $\mathcal{F}(\Phi)$ of objects admitting a composition
series-like filtration with factors in $\Phi$ has the Jordan-H\""{o}lder
property on these filtrations.
  This article has two main aims. First, we introduce notions of subobjects,
simple objects and composition series relative to the extriangulated structure
in order to define a Jordan-H\""{o}lder extriangulated category. Moreover, we
characterise these categories in terms of the associated Grothendieck monoid
and Grothendieck group.
  Second, we develop a theory of stratifying systems in extriangulated
categories. We define projective stratifying systems and show that every
stratifying system $\Phi$ in an extriangulated category is part of a projective
one $(\Phi, Q)$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}(\Phi)$ is a Jordan-H\""{o}lder
extriangulated category when $(\Phi,Q)$ satisfies some extra conditions.

UrQMD 3.4 and Pythia 6, cannot describe reasonably well the data. In the
presented paper, the yields of the particles are analyzed within the Geant4 FTF

vector meson at a given quark-anti-quark content -- $P_{Vec}$. Detailed
calculations presented in our paper show that a good description of the data
can be reached for $P_{Vec}$ = 0.6 for a meson with one strange quark or
antiquark. For a meson contained strange quark and strange antiquark, $P_{Vec}$
= 0.7. For a combination of non-strange quark and antiquark, $P_{Vec}$ = 0.5.
The description of the $\Xi^-$ and $\bar \Xi^+$ hyperons requires a change of
the diquark fragmentation function into hyperons and a special treatment
(rearrangement) of fragmentation of anti-diquark -- diquark strings with low

the underlying reason behind the known improvement the ""pairwise mass"" feature

apparently the most commonly occurring form of entanglement in linearised
systems. In general, such Gaussian entanglement results from the strong pumping
of a nonlinear process with the highly coherent and low-noise external drive
necessary for the linearisation. In contrast, recent experiments involving
efficient trilinear processes in trapped ions and superconducting circuits have
opened the complementary possibility to test the splitting of a few thermal
quanta without a linearisation process. Stimulated by such small thermal
energy, the strong degenerate trilinear coupling generates large amounts of
nonclassicality, detectable by more than 3 dB of distillable quadrature
squeezing, in contrast with the nondegenerate trilinear coupling. Substantial
entanglement can be generated in tandem with the nonclassicality generation via
linear coupling to a third mode, achieving the entanglement potential of the
nonclassical states. Such entanglement, although not captured by the covariance
matrix, grows with the mean number of split thermal quanta; something which
does not happen with Gaussian entanglement. We extend our analysis to
higher-order degenerate quanta splitting processes to demonstrate that this
non-Gaussian entanglement is already common for strongly nonlinear systems at
the low-energy thermal level. We thus shed light on the generic entanglement
mechanism for nonlinear bosonic systems operating in such low-energy regimes.

framework of generalized Rastall gravity (GRG), a modified version of original
Rastall theory in which the coupling parameter is allowed to vary with respect
to the spacetime coordinates. Introducing an ansatz for the Rastall parameter,
existence and the corresponding stability of the solutions are investigated. We
show that the GRG is capable of describing a stable singularity-free state for
the universe. The problem of transition from an ES to an inflationary state is
also addressed. We find that a time variation of the equation of state
parameter from values lying in the range |w|<1/3 to the value w=-1/3 can give
rise to such a phase transition. The vector and tensor perturbations around the
ES solution are studied, as well. In the case of GRG, the vector perturbations
remain frozen, nevertheless, the tenor perturbations can grow in such a way
that the ES solution remains stable provided the ratio of Rastall gravitational
constant to the Einsteinian one always exceeds a minimum value for each tensor
mode.

proposed physics-informed neural network (PINN), as an effective deep learning
method, has achieved successful applications in solving a wide range of partial
differential equations (PDEs), and there is still room for improvement on this
front. For example, PINN can lead to inaccurate solutions when PDE coefficients
are non-smooth and describe structurally-complex media. In this paper, we solve
the acoustic and visco-acoustic scattered-field wave equation in the frequency
domain with PINN instead of the wave equation to remove source singularity. We
first illustrate that non-smooth velocity models lead to inaccurate wavefields
when no boundary conditions are implemented in the loss function. Then, we add
the perfectly matched layer (PML) conditions in the loss function of PINN and
design a quadratic neural network to overcome the detrimental effects of
non-smooth models in PINN. We show that PML and quadratic neurons improve the
results as well as attenuation and discuss the reason for this improvement. We
also illustrate that a network trained during a wavefield simulation can be
used to pre-train the neural network of another wavefield simulation after
PDE-coefficient alteration and improve the convergence speed accordingly. This
pre-training strategy should find application in iterative full waveform

linearity, bilinearity, manifold-preserving kernels, projection-subspace, and
analogical inference. However, the major challenge of such models lies in their
loss functions that associate the dimension of relation embeddings to
corresponding entity dimension. This leads to inaccurate prediction of
corresponding relations among entities when counterparts are estimated wrongly.
ProjE KGE, published by Bordes et al., due to low computational complexity and
high potential for model improvement, is improved in this work regarding all
translative and bilinear interactions while capturing entity nonlinearity.
Experimental results on benchmark Knowledge Graphs (KGs) such as FB15K and WN18
show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models in
entity prediction task using linear and bilinear methods and other recent
powerful ones. In addition, a parallel processing structure is proposed for the
model in order to improve the scalability on large KGs. The effects of
different adaptive clustering and newly proposed sampling approaches are also
explained which prove to be effective in improving the accuracy of knowledge
graph completion.

  WSe$_2$ Transition Metal Dichalcogenide for Efficient H$_2$ Evolution
  Reaction","49 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  H$_2$ evolution reaction (HER) requires an electrocatalyst to reduce the
reaction barriers for the efficient production of H$_2$. Platinum-group metal
(PGM) elements such as Pt, Pd, etc. and their derivatives show excellent
electrocatalytic activity for HER. The high cost and lack of availability of
PGM elements bring constraints over their wide commercial applications, so
discovering noble metal-free electrocatalysts with lower possible reaction
barriers is paramount important. Two-Dimensional Transition Metal
Dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) have emerged as a pinnacle group of materials for
many potential applications, including HER. In this work, we have
computationally designed a pristine 2D monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$)
TMD using the first principle-based hybrid Density Functional Theory (DFT) to
investigate its structural, electronic properties and the electrocatalytic
performance for HER. The possible Volmer-Heyrovsky and Volmer-Tafel reaction
mechanisms for HER at the W-edge of the active site of WSe$_2$ were studied by
using a non-periodic finite molecular cluster model W$_{10}$Se$_{21}$. Our
study shows that the pristine 2D monolayer WSe$_2$ follows either the
Volmer-Heyrovsky or the Volmer-Tafel reaction mechanisms with a single-digit
low reaction barrier about 6.11, 8.41 and 6.61 kcal/mol during the solvent
phase calculations of H-migration, Heyrovsky and Tafel transition (TS) states,
respectively. The lower reaction barriers, high turnover frequency (TOF) ~ 4.24
x $10^6$ sec$^{-1}$ and 8.86 x $10^7$ sec$^{-1}$ during the Heyrovsky and Tafel
reaction steps and the low Tafel slope 29.58 mV.dec$^{-1}$ confirm that the
pristine 2D monolayer WSe$_2$ might be a promising alternative to PGM based
electrocatalyst.

  Transition Metal Dichalcogenide",,,"10.1039/D1SE02040D",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, 2D JTMDs with asymmetric electronic structures are inviting an
intense research interest in modern science and technology. Using the first
principles-based periodic hybrid dispersion-corrected Density Functional Theory
(DFT-D) method, we have investigated the equilibrium structure, geometry, and
electronic properties of the 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD with the electrocatalytic
activities for the H2 evolution reaction (HER). We have performed non-periodic
quantum mechanical DFT computations to find out the most favorable HER pathway
on the exposed surfaces of the 2D Janus MoSSe material i.e., on the Mo-edges
and S- or Se-edges. To explore the electrocatalytic HER mechanism, reaction
pathways and barriers, we have considered a cluster model system Mo10S12Se9 to
illustrate the Mo-edges and S- or Se-edges of the 2D monolayer MoSSe material.
The present study reveals that the Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction mechanism is
thermodynamically favorable reaction pathway to evolute H2 at the Se-terminated
Mo-edges. It was found that the change of free energy barrier during the
Heyrovsky reaction at the Se-terminated Mo-edges is about 3.93-7.10 kcal.mol-1
(in both the gas and the solvent phases), indicating an exceptional
electrocatalyst for HER with the lowest activation barriers. This study showed
that the Tafel slope (m) is lower in the case of 2D Janus MoSSe material due to
the overlap of the s-orbital of the hydrogen and d-orbitals of the Mo atoms
appeared in the HOMO and LUMO transition state TS1 of the H-migration reaction
step. The better stabilization of the atomic orbitals in the HER rate-limiting
step i.e., H-migration TS1 reaction step (in the solvent phase) is a key for
reducing the reaction barrier, thus the overall catalysis indicating a better
electrocatalytic performance for H2 evolution.

criteria in the market model with random coefficients from the perspective of
many players game theory. We consider five random coefficients which consist of
three market parameters which are used in the risky asset price modeling and
two preference parameters which are related to risk attitude and impact of
relative performance. We focus on two cases; either all agents have Constant
Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA) risk preferences or all agents have Constant
Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) risk preferences for their investment
optimization problem. For each case, we show that the forward Nash equilibrium
and the mean field equilibrium exist for the n-agent game and the corresponding
mean field stochastic optimal control problem, respectively. To extend the
n-agent game to the continuum of players game, we introduce a measure dependent
forward relative performance process and apply an optimization over controlled
dynamics of McKean-Vlasov type. We conclude that our optimal portfolio formulas
extend the corresponding results of the market model with constant
coefficients.

for objective functions common in nature -- based on physics and engineering

  using a Behavior-based Approach","Master's thesis",,,,"cs.CR cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Throughout recent years, the importance of internet-privacy has continuously
risen. [...] Browser fingerprinting is a technique that does not require
cookies or persistent identifiers. It derives a sufficiently unique identifier
from the various browser or device properties. Academic work has covered
offensive and defensive fingerprinting methods for almost a decade, observing a
rise in popularity. This thesis explores the current state of browser
fingerprinting on the internet. For that, we implement FPNET - a scalable &
reliable tool based on FPMON, to identify fingerprinting scripts on large sets
of websites by observing their behavior. By scanning the Alexa Top 10,000
websites, we spot several hundred networks of equally behaving scripts. For
each network, we determine the actor behind it. We track down companies like
Google, Yandex, Maxmind, Sift, or FingerprintJS, to name a few. In three
complementary studies, we further investigate the uncovered networks with
regards to I) randomization of filenames or domains, II) behavior changes, III)
security. Two consecutive scans reveal that only less than 12.5% of the pages
do not change script files. With our behavior-based approach, we successfully
re-identify almost 9,000 scripts whose filename or domain changed, and over 86%
of the scripts without URL changes. The security analysis shows an adoption of
TLS/SSL to over 98% and specific web security headers set for over 30% of the
scripts. Finally, we voice concerns about the unavoidability of modern
fingerprinting and its implications for internet users' privacy since we
believe that many users are unaware of being fingerprinted or have insufficient
possibilities to protect against it.
