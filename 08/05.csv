of the quantum criticality separating different phases of matter. Interacting
spin systems in a magnetic field offer a tantalizing opportunity to test
different approaches to study quantum phase transitions. In this work, we
exploit the new resources offered by quantum algorithms to detect the quantum
critical behaviour of fully connected spin$-1/2$ models. We define a suitable
Hamiltonian depending on an internal anisotropy parameter $\gamma,$ that allows
us to examine three paradigmatic examples of spin models, whose lattice is a
fully connected graph. We propose a method based on variational algorithms run
on superconducting transmon qubits to detect the critical behavior for systems
of finite size. We evaluate the energy gap between the first excited state and
the ground state, the magnetization along the easy-axis of the system, and the
spin-spin correlations. We finally report a discussion about the feasibility of
scaling such approach on a real quantum device for a system having a dimension
such that classical simulations start requiring significant resources.

computational problem with ubiquitous applications. When dealing with
inconsistent systems, one may seek an assignment that minimizes the number of
unsatisfied equations. This problem is NP-hard and UGC-hard to approximate
within any constant even for two-variable equations over the two-element field.
We study this problem from the point of view of parameterized complexity, with
the parameter being the number of unsatisfied equations. We consider equations
defined over Euclidean domains - a family of commutative rings that generalize
finite and infinite fields including the rationals, the ring of integers, and
many other structures. We show that if every equation contains at most two
variables, the problem is fixed-parameter tractable. This generalizes many
eminent graph separation problems such as Bipartization, Multiway Cut and
Multicut parameterized by the size of the cutset. To complement this, we show
that the problem is W[1]-hard when three or more variables are allowed in an
equation, as well as for many commutative rings that are not Euclidean domains.
On the technical side, we introduce the notion of important balanced subgraphs,
generalizing important separators of Marx [Theor. Comput. Sci. 2006] to the
setting of biased graphs. Furthermore, we use recent results on parameterized
MinCSP [Kim et al., SODA 2021] to efficiently solve a generalization of
Multicut with disjunctive cut requests.

approximate similarity search, suitable for metric spaces. We show that
inherent properties of $k$-means, like representing high-density data areas

interacting with neutron superfluid (SF), both with scalar order parameters, is
developed and applied to the surface energy (SE) of a magnetized SC body in
neutron stars (NS). Essentially, the SE studied here differs from the nuclear
SE: here, the proton SF density decays to zero while the total proton density
is constant across the surface. Interactions between the condensates are
parameterized phenomenologically and their effects determined from calculations
of a planar SE as the ranges of parameters are varied. The critical
Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter $\kappa_c$ which renders the SE equal to zero is
found analytically by noting that in a system with vanishing SE the
thermodynamic critical MF is equivalent to the upper critical MF. In the case
of weak coupling, $\kappa_c$ is shown to be a linear function of SF-SF
density-density coupling, in agreement with the earlier results based on
asymptotic intervortex interactions. Numerical simulations corroborate our
analytical predictions. Coupling due to the mixed term arising from a scalar
product of gradients of the SF densities, which had been considered in the
earlier literature, is seen to have practically no effect on the
superconductivity type. However, this coupling does produce a frozen wave
packet of the SF neutron density localized at the surface. It is shown that the
leading contribution from the gradient coupling arises from a novel mixed
quantum pressure term, but still does not affect the planar SE. The present
calculations provide an initial map of superconductivity types in the
phenomenological effective field theory and will serve as a landmark for future
studies, which require microscopic calculations of the coupling parameters
introduced here phenomenologically.

single particle losses which break the conservation of the pseudo-spin norm. We
show that this latter has key consequences on the dynamical behavior of the

superfluid order parameter decays much faster than then particle density at
short times and eventually slows-down, setting into a power-law decay at longer
time scales driven by the depletion of the system. We then consider a quench of
pairing interaction, leading to coherent oscillations in the unitary case,
followed by the switching of the dissipation. We show that losses wash away the
dynamical BCS synchronization by introducing not only damping but also a
renormalization of the frequency of coherent oscillations, which depends
non-linearly from the rate of the two-body losses.

$d v_{1}/d y^{\prime}|_{y^{\prime} = 0}$ where $y^{\prime}$ is the scaled

$\langle \epsilon_{2} \rangle$, while $v_{4}$ scales with $\langle \epsilon_{2}

firstly explored the energy--momentum complex in an $n^{th}$ order
gravitational Lagrangian $L=L\left(g_{\mu\nu}, g_{\mu\nu,i_{1}},
g_{\mu\nu,i_{1}i_{2}},g_{\mu\nu,i_{1}i_{2}i_{3}},\cdots,

Lagrangian as \mbox{$L_{g}=(\overline{R}+a_{0}R^{2}+\sum_{k=1}^{p}
a_{k}R\Box^{k}R)\sqrt{-g}$}. Its gravitational part was obtained by invariance
of gravitational action under infinitesimal rigid translations using Noether's
theorem. We also showed that this tensor, in general, is not a covariant object
but only an affine object, that is, a pseudo-tensor. Therefore, the
pseudo-tensor $\tau^{\eta}_{\alpha}$ becomes the one introduced by Einstein if
we limit ourselves to General Relativity and its extended corrections have been
explicitly indicated. The same method was used to derive the energy--momentum
complex in $ f\left (R \right) $ gravity both in Palatini and metric
approaches. Moreover, in the weak field approximation the pseudo-tensor
$\tau^{\eta}_{\alpha}$ to lowest order in the metric perturbation $h$ was
calculated. As a practical application, the power per unit solid angle $\Omega$
emitted by a localized source carried by a gravitational wave in a direction
$\hat{x}$ for a fixed wave number $\mathbf{k}$ under a suitable gauge was
obtained, through the average value of the pseudo-tensor over a suitable
spacetime domain and the local conservation of the pseudo-tensor. As a
cosmological application, in a flat Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker
spacetime, the gravitational and matter energy density in $f(R)$ gravity both
in Palatini and metric formalism was proposed.

distributions. Our desynchronization events are caused by overloads. We extend
known and propose different methods of dimensional reduction to considerably
reduce the high-dimensional phase space and to predict the rare
desynchronization events with reasonable computational costs. The first method
splits the system into two areas, connected by heavily loaded lines, and treats
each area as a single node. The second method considers a separation of the
timescales of power fluctuations and phase angle dynamics and completely
disregards the latter. The fact that this separation turns out to be justified,
albeit only to exponential accuracy in the strength of fluctuations, means that
the number of rare events does not sensitively depend on inertia or damping for
realistic heterogeneous parameters and long correlation times. Neither does the
number of desynchronization events automatically increase with non-Gaussian
fluctuations in the power production as one might have expected. On the other
hand, the analytical expressions for the average time to desynchronization
depend sensitively on the finite correlation time of the fluctuating power
input.

possible to both construct and decode QECCs that can attain the maximum
performance of the finite blocklength regime, for any chosen code length when
the code rate is sufficiently high. A recently proposed strategy for decoding
classical codes called GRAND (guessing random additive noise decoding) opened
doors to efficiently decode classical random linear codes (RLCs) performing
near the maximum rate of the finite blocklength regime. By using noise
statistics, GRAND is a noise-centric efficient universal decoder for classical
codes, provided that a simple code membership test exists. These conditions are
particularly suitable for quantum systems, and therefore the paper extends
these concepts to quantum random linear codes (QRLCs), which were known to be
possible to construct but whose decoding was not yet feasible. By combining
QRLCs and a newly proposed quantum GRAND, this paper shows that it is possible
to decode QECCs that are easy to adapt to changing conditions. The paper starts
by assessing the minimum number of gates in the coding circuit needed to reach
the QRLCs' asymptotic performance, and subsequently proposes a quantum GRAND
algorithm that makes use of quantum noise statistics, not only to build an

the machine does not process another job at $t$, and the resource is
replenished between its release date and $t$. Each replenishment has a cost,
which is independent of the amount replenished. The objective is to minimize
the total replenishment cost plus the maximum flow time of the jobs.
  We consider the online variant of the problem, where the jobs are released
over time, and once a job is inserted into the schedule, its starting time
cannot be changed. We propose a deterministic 2-competitive online algorithm
for the general input. Moreover, we show that for a certain class of inputs

$\sqrt{2}$ as the number of jobs tends to infinity. We also derive several

correspond to the three independent components of the energy-momentum tensor.
We show that such a three-moment truncation reproduces accurately the exact
solution of the kinetic equation after a simple renormalization that takes into
account the effects of the neglected higher moments. We derive second-order
Israel-Stewart hydrodynamic equations from the three-moment equations, and show
that, for most physically relevant initial conditions, these equations yield
results comparable to those of the three-moment truncation, albeit less
accurate. We attribute this feature to the fact that the structure of
Israel-Stewart equations is similar to that of the three-moment truncation. In
particular, the presence of the relaxation term in the Israel-Stewart
equations, yields an early-time regime that mimics approximately the
collisionless regime. A detailed comparison of the three-moment truncation with
second-order non-conformal hydrodynamics reveals ambiguities in the definition
of second-order transport coefficients. These ambiguities affect the ability of
Israel-Stewart hydrodynamics to reproduce results of kinetic theory.

estimation problems are universal with respect to underlying sensing (or
design) matrices. Specifically, matrices with markedly different constructions
seem to achieve identical performance if they share the same spectral
distribution and have ``generic'' singular vectors. We prove this universality
phenomenon for the case of convex regularized least squares (RLS) estimators
under a linear regression model with additive Gaussian noise. Our main
contributions are two-fold: (1) We introduce a notion of universality classes
for sensing matrices, defined through a set of deterministic conditions that
fix the spectrum of the sensing matrix and precisely capture the previously
heuristic notion of generic singular vectors; (2) We show that for all sensing
matrices that lie in the same universality class, the dynamics of the proximal
gradient descent algorithm for solving the regression problem, as well as the
performance of RLS estimators themselves (under additional strong convexity
conditions) are asymptotically identical. In addition to including i.i.d.
Gaussian and rotational invariant matrices as special cases, our universality
class also contains highly structured, strongly correlated, or even (nearly)
deterministic matrices. Examples of the latter include randomly signed versions
of incoherent tight frames and randomly subsampled Hadamard transforms. As a
consequence of this universality principle, the asymptotic performance of
regularized linear regression on many structured matrices constructed with
limited randomness can be characterized by using the rotationally invariant
ensemble as an equivalent yet mathematically more tractable surrogate.

log-normal, inverse $\chi^2$ and $\chi^2$ superstatistics were incorporated
into the model. We examined the implication of the three superstatistics on
different cosmological parameters, namely, the dimensionless energy density and
the equation-of-state (EoS) of THDE, along with the deceleration parameter and
the squared speed of sound. As a result, we noted that the cosmological
parameters stemming from the $\chi^2$ superstatistics, with a parameter $q >
1$, represent the highest deviation from those ascribed to the standard DGP
model. While the system parameters show appropriate behavior in all three
cases, the model cannot achieve stability throughout the history of the
Universe. It is probably the outcome of setting the Hubble horizon as the
infrared cutoff. Furthermore, the behavior of EoS was found to be governed by
the value of the THDE parameter ${\delta}$. That is to say, for ${\delta} > 2$
THDE exhibits a phantom-like behavior while for ${\delta} < 2$ it displays a
quintessence behavior. Constrained by the dominant energy condition, an upper

Plasma inflows accompany a variety of processes in the solar
atmosphere such as heating of coronal loops and formation of prominences.
  Aims. We model a stratified solar atmosphere, within which a simulated
prominence thread experiences density accumulation via a plasma inflow designed
to mimic the formation process. We aim to investigate the interaction of such a
system with torsional perturbations, and the possible consequences.
  Methods. The linearised equations of motion and induction are integrated to
analyse the spatial and temporal evolution of torsional perturbations that are
randomly driven at the photospheric footpoints.
  Results. Our results demonstrate that magnetic threads will experience twist
amplification. Different sources and sinks of energy and the corresponding
amplification mechanisms are identified. Threads reaching chromospheric heights
are most susceptible to magnetic twisting with the maximum twist occurring near
their footpoints. The amplifying twists are associated with a standing wave
behaviour along the simulated threads.
  Conclusions. Our work suggests that torsional perturbations may be amplified
within prominence threads, with strong magnetic twists forming at the
footpoints. The amplification process is facilitated by small length scales in
the background magnetic field. On the other hand, a small length scale in the
background density inhibits growth. Possible consequences of the amplified
twists, including their role in supporting the dense plasma within a prominence
structure are discussed.

finding a subset (knapsack) of items: individually best, diverse, and
Nash-welfare-based. Informally, diversity is achieved by satisfying as many
voters as possible. Motivated by the application of aggregation operators in
multiwinner elections, we extend the study from diverse aggregation rule to
Median and Best scoring functions. We study the computational and parameterized
complexity of the problem with respect to some natural parameters, namely, the
number of voters, the number of items, and the distance from an easy instance.
We also study the complexity of the problem under domain restrictions.
Furthermore, we present significantly faster parameterized algorithms with
respect to the number of voters for the diverse aggregation rule.

class of optimal control problems subject to parabolic partial differential
equation (PDE) constraints under uncertainty: the state in our setting is the
solution of a parabolic PDE with a random thermal diffusion coefficient,
steered by a control function. To account for the presence of uncertainty in
the optimal control problem, the objective function is composed with a risk
measure. We focus on two risk measures, both involving high-dimensional
integrals over the stochastic variables: the expected value and the (nonlinear)
entropic risk measure. The high-dimensional integrals are computed numerically
using specially designed QMC methods and, under moderate assumptions on the
input random field, the error rate is shown to be essentially linear,
independently of the stochastic dimension of the problem -- and thereby
superior to ordinary Monte Carlo methods. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

recent technology for the numerical approximation of partial differential
equations (PDEs), that generalizes finite elements to polytopal computational
grids. So far, VEM has been extended to several problems described by PDEs, and
recently also to the time-dependent Maxwell equations. When the time
discretization of PDEs is performed implicitly, at each time-step a large-scale
and ill-conditioned linear system must be solved, that, in case of Maxwell
equations, is particularly challenging, because of the presence of both H(div)
and H(curl) discretization spaces. We propose here a parallel preconditioner,
that exploits the Schur complement block factorization of the linear system
matrix and consists of a Jacobi preconditioner for the H(div) block and an
auxiliary space preconditioner for the H(curl) block. Several parallel

Each agent in the network receives continuous streaming data locally and works
collaboratively to learn a nonlinear prediction function that is globally
optimal in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space with respect to the total
instantaneous costs of all agents. In order to circumvent the curse of
dimensionality issue in traditional online kernel learning, we utilize random
feature (RF) mapping to convert the non-parametric kernel learning problem into
a fixed-length parametric one in the RF space. We then propose a novel learning
framework named Online Decentralized Kernel learning via Linearized ADMM
(ODKLA) to efficiently solve the online decentralized kernel learning problem.
To further improve the communication efficiency, we add the quantization and
censoring strategies in the communication stage and develop the Quantized and
Communication-censored ODKLA (QC-ODKLA) algorithm. We theoretically prove that
both ODKLA and QC-ODKLA can achieve the optimal sublinear regret
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ over $T$ time slots. Through numerical experiments, we
evaluate the learning effectiveness, communication, and computation

  Modeling for Text-independent Speaker Recognition",,,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning an effective speaker representation is crucial for achieving
reliable performance in speaker verification tasks. Speech signals are
high-dimensional, long, and variable-length sequences that entail a complex
hierarchical structure. Signals may contain diverse information at each
time-frequency (TF) location. For example, it may be more beneficial to focus
on high-energy parts for phoneme classes such as fricatives. The standard
convolutional layer that operates on neighboring local regions cannot capture
the complex TF global context information. In this study, a general global
time-frequency context modeling framework is proposed to leverage the context
information specifically for speaker representation modeling. First, a
data-driven attention-based context model is introduced to capture the
long-range and non-local relationship across different time-frequency
locations. Second, a data-independent 2D-DCT based context model is proposed to
improve model interpretability. A multi-DCT attention mechanism is presented to
improve modeling power with alternate DCT base forms. Finally, the global
context information is used to recalibrate salient time-frequency locations by
computing the similarity between the global context and local features. The
proposed lightweight blocks can be easily incorporated into a speaker model
with little additional computational costs and effectively improves the speaker
verification performance compared to the standard ResNet model and
Squeeze\&Excitation block by a large margin. Detailed ablation studies are also
performed to analyze various factors that may impact performance of the
proposed individual modules. Results from experiments show that the proposed
global context modeling framework can efficiently improve the learned speaker
representations by achieving channel-wise and time-frequency feature
recalibration.

and held at the Flatiron Institute in New York, March 28-30th 2022. The
workshop included over 50 in-person attendees invited from over 300
applications. It identified seven key software areas of need: (i) scalable
cross-matching and distributed joining of catalogs, (ii) robust photometric
redshift determination, (iii) software for determination of selection
functions, (iv) frameworks for scalable time-series analyses, (v) services for
image access and reprocessing at scale, (vi) object image access (cutouts) and
analysis at scale, and (vii) scalable job execution systems.
  This white paper summarizes the discussions of this workshop. It considers
the motivating science use cases, identified cross-cutting algorithms,
software, and services, their high-level technical specifications, and the

red novae (LRNe): AT2018bwo, AT2021afy, and AT2021blu. AT2018bwo was discovered
in NGC45 (at 6.8 Mpc) a few weeks after the outburst onset. During the
monitoring period, the transient reached a peak luminosity of 10^40 erg/s.
AT2021afy, hosted by UGC10043 (49.2 Mpc), showed a double-peaked light curve,
with the two peaks reaching a similar luminosity of 2.1(+-0.6)x10^41 erg/s. For
AT2021blu in UGC5829, (8.6 Mpc), the pre-outburst phase was well-monitored by
several photometric surveys, and the object showed a slow luminosity rise
before the outburst. The light curve of AT2021blu was sampled with an
unprecedented cadence until the object disappeared behind the Sun, and it was
then recovered at late phases. The light curve of AT2021blu shows a double
peak, with a prominent early maximum reaching a luminosity of 6.5x10^40 erg/s,
which is half of that of AT2021afy. The spectra of AT2021afy and AT2021blu
display the expected evolution for LRNe: a blue continuum dominated by
prominent Balmer lines in emission during the first peak, and a redder
continuum consistent with that of a K-type star with narrow absorption metal
lines during the second, broad maximum. The spectra of AT2018bwo are markedly
different, with a very red continuum dominated by broad molecular features in
absorption. As these spectra closely resemble those of LRNe after the second
peak, AT2018bwo was probably discovered at the very late evolutionary stages.
This would explain its fast evolution and the spectral properties compatible
with that of an M-type star. From the analysis of deep frames of the LRN sites
years before the outburst, and considerations of the light curves, the
quiescent progenitor systems of the three LRNe were likely massive, with
primaries ranging from 13Mo for AT2018bwo, to 13-18Mo for AT2021blu, and over
40Mo for AT2021afy.

major challenge in continued downscaling of integrated circuits beyond the 7-nm
technology node as it leads to unacceptable signal delays and power consumption
in computing. The resistivity of Cu increases due to electron scattering at
surfaces and grain boundaries of the interconnects at the nanoscale.
Topological semimetals, owing to their topologically protected surface states
and suppressed electron backscattering, are promising material candidates to
potentially replace current Cu interconnects as low-resistance interconnects.
Here, we report the attractive resistivity scaling of topological metal MoP
nanowires and show that the resistivity values are comparable to those of Cu
interconnects below 500 nm$^2$ cross-section areas. More importantly, we
demonstrate that the dimensional scaling of MoP nanowires, in terms of line
resistance versus total cross-sectional area, is superior to those of effective
Cu and barrier-less Ru interconnects, suggesting MoP is an attractive solution
to the current scaling challenge of Cu interconnects.

for a class of hybrid systems given by the combination of continuous dynamics
on a flow set and discrete dynamics on a jump set. For this purpose, the notion
of Zhukovskii stability, typically stated for continuous-time systems, is
extended to the hybrid systems. Necessary conditions, particularly, a condition
using a forward invariance notion, for existence of hybrid limit cycles are
first presented. In addition, a sufficient condition, related to Zhukovskii
stability, for the existence of (or lack of) hybrid limit cycles is
established. Furthermore, under mild assumptions, we show that asymptotic
stability of such hybrid limit cycles is not only equivalent to asymptotic
stability of a fixed point of the associated Poincar\'{e} map but also robust
to perturbations. Specifically, robustness to generic perturbations, which
capture state noise and unmodeled dynamics, and to inflations of the flow and
jump sets are established in terms of $\mathcal{KL}$ bounds. Furthermore,
results establishing relationships between the properties of a computed
Poincar\'{e} map, which is necessarily affected by computational error, and the
actual asymptotic stability properties of a hybrid limit cycle are proposed. In
particular, it is shown that asymptotic stability of the exact Poincar\'{e} map
is preserved when computed with enough precision. Several examples, including a
congestion control system and spiking neurons, are presented to illustrate the
notions and results throughout the paper.

NeuroEvolution to modular and simple neural networks enables the efficient
generation of smaller and more structured neural networks while providing
acceptable (and in some cases superior) accuracy on large data sets. MGE also
enhances the state-of-the-art Grammatical Evolution (GE) methods in two
directions. First, MGE's representation is modular in that each individual has
a set of genes, and each gene is mapped to a neuron by grammatical rules.
Second, the proposed representation mitigates two important drawbacks of GE,
namely the low scalability and weak locality of representation, towards
generating modular and multi-layer networks with a high number of neurons. We
define and evaluate five different forms of structures with and without
modularity using MGE and find single-layer modules with no coupling more
productive. Our experiments demonstrate that modularity helps in finding better
neural networks faster. We have validated the proposed method using ten
well-known classification benchmarks with different sizes, feature counts, and
output class count. Our experimental results indicate that MGE provides
superior accuracy with respect to existing NeuroEvolution methods and returns
classifiers that are significantly simpler than other machine learning
generated classifiers. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that MGE outperforms
other GE methods in terms of locality and scalability properties.

gradient descent (SGD) on two-layer ReLU networks with standard initialization,
in three regimes where key sets of weights rotate little (either naturally due
to GF and SGD, or due to an artificial constraint), and making use of margins
as the core analytic technique. The first regime is near initialization,
specifically until the weights have moved by $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt m)$, where $m$
denotes the network width, which is in sharp contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(1)$
weight motion allowed by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK); here it is shown that
GF and SGD only need a network width and number of samples inversely
proportional to the NTK margin, and moreover that GF attains at least the NTK
margin itself, which suffices to establish escape from bad KKT points of the
margin objective, whereas prior work could only establish nondecreasing but
arbitrarily small margins. The second regime is the Neural Collapse (NC)
setting, where data lies in extremely-well-separated groups, and the sample
complexity scales with the number of groups; here the contribution over prior
work is an analysis of the entire GF trajectory from initialization. Lastly, if
the inner layer weights are constrained to change in norm only and can not
rotate, then GF with large widths achieves globally maximal margins, and its
sample complexity scales with their inverse; this is in contrast to prior work,
which required infinite width and a tricky dual convergence assumption. As
purely technical contributions, this work develops a variety of potential
functions and other tools which will hopefully aid future work.

Recently, a superconductor with one of the lowest average quasiparticle
densities ever measured exhibited quasiparticles primarily produced in bursts
which decreased in rate with time after cooldown. Similarly, several cryogenic
calorimeters used to search for dark matter have also observed an unknown
source of low-energy phonon bursts that decrease in rate with time after
cooldown. Here, we show that a silicon crystal glued to its holder exhibits a
rate of low-energy phonon events that is more than two orders of magnitude
larger than in a functionally identical crystal suspended from its holder in a
low-stress state. The excess phonon event rate in the glued crystal decreases
with time since cooldown, consistent with a source of phonon bursts which
contributes to quasiparticle poisoning in quantum circuits and the low-energy
events observed in cryogenic calorimeters. We argue that relaxation of
thermally induced stress between the glue and crystal is the source of these
events, and conclude that stress relaxation contributes to quasiparticle
poisoning in superconducting qubits and the athermal phonon background in a
broad class of rare-event searches.

introduced by the neutrinos' mass. Moreover, with this simplification one can
exploit FFTLog methods to speed up the computations even more. We validate our

infrastructure sensors (e.g., LiDAR) can provide richer information even under

various transportation applications. The state-of-the-art 3D detection models
are applied to detect vehicles in the merged point cloud. We test the proposed

that very low penetration rates of CAV plus an infrastructure sensor are
sufficient to achieve comparable performance with 30% or higher penetration

  History","accepted at Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems",,"10.1029/2022GC010611",,"physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Over its multibillion-year history, Earth has exhibited a wide range of
climates. Its history ranges from snowball episodes where the surface was
mostly or entirely covered by ice to periods much warmer than today, where the
cryosphere was virtually absent. Our understanding of greenhouse gas evolution
over this long history, specifically carbon dioxide, is mainly informed by
deterministic models. However, the complexity of the carbon cycle and its
uncertainty over time motivates the study of non-deterministic models, where
key elements of the cycle are represented by inherently stochastic processes.
By doing so, we can learn what models of variability are compatible with
Earth's climate record instead of how exactly this variability is produced. In
this study, we address why there were snowballs in the Proterozoic, but not the
Phanerozoic by discussing two simple stochastic models of long-term
carbon-cycle variability. The first, which is the most simple and represents
CO2 concentration directly as a stochastic process, is instructive and perhaps
intuitive, but is incompatible with the absence of snowballs in the
Phanerozoic. The second, which separates carbon source from sink and represents
CO2 outgassing as a stochastic process instead of concentration, is more
flexible. When outgassing fluctuates over longer periods, as opposed to brief
and rapid excursions from a mean state, this model is more compatible with the
snowball record, showing only modest increases in the probability of snowball
events over Earth history. The contrast between these models illustrates what
kind of variability may have characterized the long-term carbon cycle.

these systems: CEERS-1749. Based on $0.6-5\mu$m photometry, this strikingly
luminous ($\approx$26 mag) galaxy appears to lie at $z\approx17$. This would
make it an $M_{\rm{UV}}\approx-22$,
$M_{\rm{\star}}\approx5\times10^{9}M_{\rm{\odot}}$ system that formed a mere
$\sim220$ Myrs after the Big Bang. The implied number density of this galaxy
and its analogues challenges virtually every early galaxy evolution model that
assumes $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. However, there is strong environmental evidence
supporting a secondary redshift solution of $z\approx5$: all three of the
galaxy's nearest neighbors at $<2.5$"" have photometric redshifts of
$z\approx5$. Further, we show that CEERS-1749 may lie in a $z\approx5$
protocluster that is $\gtrsim5\times$ overdense compared to the field. Intense
line emission at $z\approx5$ from a quiescent galaxy harboring ionized gas, or
from a dusty starburst, may provide satisfactory explanations for CEERS-1749's
photometry. The emission lines at $z\approx5$ conspire to boost the $>2\mu$m
photometry, producing an apparent blue slope as well as a strong break in the
SED. Such a perfectly disguised contaminant is possible only in a narrow
redshift window ($\Delta z\lesssim0.1$), implying that the permitted volume for
such interlopers may not be a major concern for $z>10$ searches, particularly
when medium-bands are deployed. If CEERS-1749 is confirmed to lie at
$z\approx5$, it will be the highest-redshift quiescent galaxy, or one of the
lowest mass dusty galaxies of the early Universe detected to-date. Both
redshift solutions of this intriguing galaxy hold the potential to challenge
existing models of early galaxy evolution, making spectroscopic follow-up of
this source critical.

the issue of the LS method from a statistical perspective: the biased
calibration is caused by the correlations/dependencies in regression residuals.
Based on this explanation, we propose a new calibration method for
single-regime speed-density models by modeling the covariance of residuals via
a zero-mean Gaussian Process (GP). Our approach can be viewed as a generalized
least-squares (GLS) method with a specific covariance structure (i.e., kernel

least-squares (WLS) methods. Next, we use a sparse approximation to address the
scalability issue of GPs and apply a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling
scheme to obtain the posterior distributions of the parameters for
speed-density models and the hyperparameters (i.e., length scale and variance)

intensity and polarisation Stokes parameters of the SGWB. Collision terms,
which account for gravitational Compton scattering off of massive objects, are
also included. This set resembles that for the CMB Stokes parameters, but the
different spin nature of the gravitational radiation and the physics involved
in the scattering process determine crucial differences. In this case, due to
the Rutherford angular dependence of the cross section, all the SGWB intensity
multipoles of order $\ell$ are scattered out, producing outgoing intensity
anisotropies of any order $\ell$ if they are present in the incoming radiation.
On the other hand, SGWB linear polarisation modes can be expanded in a basis of
spherical harmonics with $m=\pm 4$ and $\ell\ge 4$. This means that SGWB
polarisation modes can be generated from unpolarised anisotropic radiation only
with $m=\pm 4$, therefore requiring at least a hexadecapole anisotropy
($\ell\ge 4$) in the incoming intensity. Assuming a simplified toy model, we
solve analytically the set of coupled Boltzmann equations to get explicit
expressions for the intensity and polarisation angular power spectra. We
confirm the contribution of the gravitational Compton scattering to the SGWB
anisoptropies is extremely small for collisions with compact objects in the
frequency range of current and upcoming surveys. The system of coupled
Boltzmann equations presented here provides a way to an accurate estimate of
the total amount of anisotropies generated by multiple SGWB scattering
processes off of massive objects, as well as the interplay between polarisation
and intensity, during the GW propagation across the LSS of the universe. These
results will be useful for the full treatment of the astrophysical SWGB
anisotropies in view of upcoming gravitational waves observatories.

over discrete representations in recent years. However, fitting an INR to the
given observations usually requires optimization with gradient descent from
scratch, which is inefficient and does not generalize well with sparse
observations. To address this problem, most of the prior works train a
hypernetwork that generates a single vector to modulate the INR weights, where
the single vector becomes an information bottleneck that limits the
reconstruction precision of the output INR. Recent work shows that the whole
set of weights in INR can be precisely inferred without the single-vector
bottleneck by gradient-based meta-learning. Motivated by a generalized
formulation of gradient-based meta-learning, we propose a formulation that uses
Transformers as hypernetworks for INRs, where it can directly build the whole
set of INR weights with Transformers specialized as set-to-set mapping. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for building INRs in different
tasks and domains, including 2D image regression and view synthesis for 3D

gradient-based meta-learning algorithms and we provide further analysis for
understanding the generated INRs.

automatically select categories across source and target domains that can be

examine the influence of the underlying tree topology on the resulting Bayesian

arising in this problem is therefore a mixture of unlabeled background and
signal events, and the primary aim of the analysis is to determine whether the

invariance to task-irrelevant semantics, separability of classes in some latent

their discrete, non-Euclidean nature, graph datasets and graph SSL methods are
unlikely to satisfy these properties. This raises the question: how do graph
SSL methods, such as contrastive learning (CL), work well? To systematically

Our analysis yields formal insights into the limitations of GGAs and the
necessity of task-relevant augmentations. As we empirically show, GGAs do not
induce task-relevant invariances on common benchmark datasets, leading to only
marginal gains over naive, untrained baselines. Our theory motivates a

comparison of the photometry leads to the following results: 1) Photometric
incompleteness between individual reductions shows only a minimal difference

stacked frames than DOLPHOT runs on individual frames. 3) Statistical errors
assigned directly by the photometry codes are 25% to 50% smaller than the
errors measured from artificial star tests. 4) Systematic errors are magnitude
dependent and become larger at the faint end, at the level of $\sigma_s\sim0.1$

significant systematic error ($\sigma_s \sim 0.05$ mag). 6) Individual
reductions agree well at the 0.02 mag level when the systematic errors are
properly corrected through artificial star tests. The reasonable agreement
between the reductions leads to important implications that i) the reduction

dramatically alter the KPV analysis. We find that for the
$\alpha'^2$-corrections to be sufficiently small to recover essentially the
leading-order KPV potential one needs a surprisingly large $S^3$ radius,
corresponding to $g_sM > 20$. In the context of the Large Volume Scenario (LVS)
this implies a D3-tadpole of at least $\mathcal{O}(10^3-10^4)$. However, large
$\alpha'^2$-corrections do not necessarily spoil the uplift in KPV. Rather, as
the curvature corrections lower the tension of the brane, a novel uplifting
mechanism suggests itself where the smallness of the uplift is achieved by a
tuning of curvature corrections. A key underlying assumption is the existence
of a dense discretuum of $g_s$. This new mechanism does not require a deep
warped throat, thereby sidestepping the main difficulty in uplifting KKLT and
LVS. However, all of the above has to be treated as a preliminary exploration
of possibilities since, at the moment, not all relevant correction at the order

origin of galaxy clusters that are gas poor and have a low surface-brightness
by studying covariances between various cluster properties at fixed mass using
hydrodynamic cosmological simulations. We extracted approx. 1800 galaxy
clusters from a high-resolution Magneticum hydrodynamic cosmological simulation
and computed covariances at fixed mass of the following properties:
core-excised X-ray luminosity, gas fraction, hot gas temperature, formation
redshift, concentration, galaxy richness, fossilness parameter, and stellar
mass of the bright central galaxy. We also compared the correlation between
concentration and gas fractions in non-radiative simulations, and we followed
the trajectories of particles inside galaxy clusters to assess the role of AGN
depletion on the gas fraction. In simulations and in observational data,
differences in surface brightness are related to differences in gas fraction.
Simulations show that the gas fraction strongly correlates with assembly time,
in the sense that older clusters are gas poor. Clusters that formed earlier
have lower gas fractions because the feedback of the active galactic nucleus
ejected a significant amount of gas from the halo. When the X-ray luminosity is
corrected for the gas fraction, it shows little or no covariance with other
quantities. Older galaxy clusters tend to be gas poor and possess a low X-ray
surface brightness because the feedback mechanism removes a significant
fraction of gas from these objects. Moreover, we found that most of the $L_X$
covariance with the other quantities is explained by differences in the gas
fraction.

supplies valuable information about the relation between fundamental FIR and

of the Lockman-SpReSO project and of its early results. Methods. We selected
FIR sources from \textit{Herschel} observations of the central 24 arcmin
$\times$ 24 arcmin of the LH field with an optical counterpart up to 24.5
$R_{\rm C}$(AB). The sample comprises 956 \textit{Herschel} FIR sources, plus
188 additional interesting objects in the field. These are point X-ray sources,
cataclysmic variable star candidates, high-velocity halo star candidates, radio
sources, very red quasi-stellar objects, and optical counterparts of
sub-millimetre galaxies. The faint component of the catalogue ($R_{\rm
C}(\mathrm{AB})\geq20$) was observed using the OSIRIS instrument on the 10.4 m

All comments are welcome!",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.107.043504",,"astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Compensated isocurvature perturbations (CIPs) are relative density
perturbations in which a baryon-density fluctuation is accompanied by a dark
matter density fluctuation such that the total-matter density is unperturbed.
These fluctuations can be produced primordially if multiple fields are present
during inflation, and therefore they can be used to differentiate between
different models for the early Universe. Kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ)
tomography allows for the reconstruction of the radial-velocity field of matter
as a function of redshift. This technique can be used to reconstruct the
total-matter-overdensity field, independent of the galaxy-density field
obtained from large-scale galaxy surveys. We leverage the ability to measure
the galaxy- and matter-overdensity fields independently to construct a
minimum-variance estimator for the primordial CIP amplitude, based on a
mode-by-mode comparison of the two measurements. We forecast that a
configuration corresponding to CMB-S4 and VRO will be able to detect (at
$2\sigma$) a CIP amplitude $A$ (for a scale-invariant power spectrum) as small
as $A\simeq 5\times 10^{-9}$. Similarly, a configuration corresponding to SO
and DESI will be sensitive to a CIP amplitude $A\simeq 1\times 10^{-7}$. These
values are to be compared to current constraints $A \leq {\cal O}(0.01)$.

analyzed optical emission lines of 30 of those 50 objects and found that they
are characterized by either a high accretion rate
($L_\mathrm{Bol}/L_\mathrm{Edd}>0.3$) or low accretion rate
($0.03<L_\mathrm{Bol}/L_\mathrm{Edd}<0.3$). We report that the outflow velocity
is inversely correlated with the BAL location among the high accretion rate
objects, with the highest velocities observed in the parsec-scale outflows. In
contrast, the low Eddington ratio objects showed the opposite trend. We
confirmed the known relationship between outflow velocity and
$L_\mathrm{Bol}/L_\mathrm{Edd}$, and found that the scatter plausibly
originates in the force multiplier (launch radius) in the low (high) accretion
rate objects. A log volume filling factor between $-6$ and $-4$ was found in
most outflows, but was as high as $-1$ for low-velocity compact outflows. We
investigated the relationship between the observed [O III] emission and that
predicted from the BAL gas. We found that these could be reconciled if the
emission-line covering fraction depends on Seyfert type and BAL location. The
difference between the predicted and observed [O III] luminosity is correlated
with the outflow velocity, suggesting that [O III] emission in high Eddington
ratio objects may be broad and hidden under Fe II emission. We suggest that the
physical differences in the outflow properties as a function of location in the
quasar and accretion rate point to different formation, acceleration, and
confinement mechanisms for the two FeLoBALQ types.

(AVs), called predictor-corrector potential game (PCPG), composed of a
Predictor and a Corrector. To enable human-like reasoning and characterize
agent interactions, a receding-horizon multi-player game is formulated. To
address the challenges caused by the complexity in solving a multi-player game
and by the requirement of real-time operation, a potential game (PG) based
decision-making framework is developed. In the PG Predictor, the agent cost
functions are heuristically predefined. We acknowledge that the behaviors of
other traffic agents, e.g., human-driven vehicles and pedestrians, may not
necessarily be consistent with the predefined cost functions. To address this
issue, a best response-based PG Corrector is designed. In the Corrector, the
action deviation between the ego vehicle prediction and the surrounding agent
actual behaviors are measured and are fed back to the ego vehicle
decision-making, to correct the prediction errors caused by the inaccurate
predefined cost functions and to improve the ego vehicle strategies.
  Distinguished from most existing game-theoretic approaches, this PCPG 1)
deals with multi-player games and guarantees the existence of a pure-strategy
Nash equilibrium (PSNE), convergence of the PSNE seeking algorithm, and global
optimality of the derived PSNE when multiple PSNE exist; 2) is computationally
scalable in a multi-agent scenario; 3) guarantees the ego vehicle safety under
certain conditions; and 4) approximates the actual PSNE of the system despite
the unknown cost functions of others. Comparative studies between the PG, the
PCPG, and the control barrier function (CBF) based approaches are conducted in
diverse traffic scenarios, including oncoming traffic scenario and
multi-vehicle intersection-crossing scenario.

direction of its average flow. Using martingale theory, we show that the infima
of integrated edge currents in time-homogeneous Markov jump processes are
geometrically distributed, with a mean value determined by the effective
affinity measured by a marginal observer that only sees the integrated edge
current. In addition, we show that a marginal observer can estimate a finite
fraction of the average entropy production rate in the underlying
nonequilibrium process from the extreme value statistics in the integrated edge
current. The estimated average rate of dissipation obtained in this way equals
the above mentioned effective affinity times the average edge current.
Moreover, we show that estimates of dissipation based on extreme value
statistics can be significantly more accurate than those based on thermodynamic
uncertainty ratios, as well as those based on a naive estimator obtained by
neglecting nonMarkovian correlations in the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the
trajectories of the integrated edge current.

revenue management systems. Even with two or three rivals, competition is still
highly fierce. This paper studies sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium of a price
competition in an oligopoly market with perishable assets. Sellers each has one
unit of a good that cannot be replenished, and they compete in setting prices
to sell their good over a finite sales horizon. Each period, buyers desire one
unit of the good and the number of buyers coming to the market in each period
is random. All sellers' prices are accessible for buyers, and search is
costless. Using stochastic dynamic programming methods, the best response of
sellers can be obtained from a one-shot price competition game regarding
remained periods and the current-time demand structure. Assuming a binary
demand model, we demonstrate that the duopoly model has a unique Nash
equilibrium and the oligopoly model does not reveal price dispersion with

geometry and turbulent driving. In our fiducial cloud the raw simulation data
reproduces the observed multiplicity fractions for Solar-type and higher mass

incompleteness the simulation under-predicts these values. The discrepancy is
likely due to the lack of disk fragmentation, as the simulation only resolves
multiples that form either through capture or core fragmentation. The raw mass
distribution of companions is consistent with randomly drawing from the initial
mass function for the companions of $>1\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ stars, however,
accounting for observational incompleteness produces a flatter distribution
similar to observations. We show that stellar multiplicity changes as the cloud
evolves and anti-correlates with stellar density. This relationship also
explains most multiplicity variations between runs, i.e., variations in the
initial conditions that increase stellar density (increased surface density,
reduced turbulence) decrease multiplicity. While other parameters, such as

These estimated parameters are of interest to neuroscientists as they can be
mapped to features of cognitive processes of decision making (such as speed,
caution, and bias) and related to brain activity. The observed patterns of RT
also reflect the variability of cognitive processes from trial to trial
mediated by neural dynamics. We adapted a SincNet-based shallow neural network

experimental trial. The model consists of a SincNet layer, a depthwise spatial
convolution layer, and two separate FC layers that predict drift rate and
boundary for each trial in-parallel. The SincNet layer parametrized the kernels
in order to directly learn the low and high cutoff frequencies of bandpass

negative log likelihood function of WFPT distribution given trial RT. We
developed separate decision SincNet models for each participant performing a

the outflow clearly is the dominant component of the nebula (around 75% of the

laminar flows in different regimes, using numerical benchmarks.
  Design/methodology/approach: The work presents a detailed comparison with
reference solutions published in the literature -- when available -- and
numerical results computed using a commercial cell-centred finite volume
software.
  Findings: The FCFV scheme provides first-order accurate approximations of the
viscous stress tensor and the heat flux, insensitively to cell distortion or
stretching. The strategy demonstrates its efficiency in inviscid and viscous
flows, for a wide range of Mach numbers, also in the incompressible limit. In
purely inviscid flows, non-oscillatory approximations are obtained in the
presence of shock waves. In the incompressible limit, accurate solutions are
computed without pressure correction algorithms. The method shows its superior
performance for viscous high Mach number flows, achieving physically admissible
solutions without carbuncle effect and predictions of quantities of interest
with errors below 5%.
  Originality/value: The FCFV method accurately evaluates, for a wide range of
compressible laminar flows, quantities of engineering interest, such as drag,
lift and heat transfer coefficients, on unstructured meshes featuring distorted
and highly stretched cells, with an aspect ratio up to ten thousand. The method
is suitable to simulate industrial flows on complex geometries, relaxing the
requirements on mesh quality introduced by existing finite volume solvers and
alleviating the need for time-consuming manual procedures for mesh generation
to be performed by specialised technicians.

on construction, ergodicity and geometric ergodicity of reflected diffusions in
the positive orthant $\mathbb{R}^d_+$, $d \in \mathbb{N}$. The geometric
ergodicity results, although very general, usually give implicit convergence
rates due to abstract couplings and Lyapunov functions used in obtaining them.
This leads us to some recent results on an important subclass of reflected
Brownian motions (RBM) (constant drift and diffusion coefficients and oblique
reflection at boundaries), known as the Harrison-Reiman class, where explicit
rates of convergence are obtained as functions of the system parameters and
underlying dimension. In addition, sufficient conditions on system parameters
of the RBM are provided under which local convergence to stationarity holds at
a `dimension-free' rate, that is, for any fixed $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the rate of
convergence of the $k$-marginal to equilibrium does not depend on the dimension
of the whole system. Finally, we study the long time behavior of infinite
dimensional rank-based diffusions, including the well-studied infinite Atlas
model. The gaps between the ordered particles evolve as infinite dimensional
RBM and this gap process has uncountably many explicit product form stationary
distributions. Sufficient conditions for initial configurations to lie in the
weak domain of attraction of the various stationary distributions are provided.
Finally, it is shown that, under conditions, all of these explicit stationary
distributions are extremal (equivalently, ergodic) and, in some sense, the only
product form invariant probability distributions. Proof techniques involve a
pathwise analysis of RBM using explicit synchronous and mirror couplings and

non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) local datasets. CF-CL
introduces a push-pull smart data sharing mechanism tailored to unsupervised FL
settings, in which, each device pushes a subset of its local datapoints to its
neighbors as reserved data points, and pulls a set of datapoints from its
neighbors, sampled through a probabilistic importance sampling technique. We
demonstrate that CF-CL leads to (i) alignment of unsupervised learned latent
spaces across devices, (ii) faster global convergence, allowing for less
frequent global model aggregations; and (iii) is effective in extreme
non-i.i.d. data settings across the devices.

(EVs) while driving, avoiding stopping for charging and hence fostering their
widespread adoption. Researchers devoted much effort over the last decade to
provide a reliable infrastructure for potential users to improve comfort and
time management. Due to the severe security and performance system
requirements, the different scheme proposed in last years lack of a unified
protocol involving the modern architecture model with merged authentication and
billing processes. Furthermore, they require the continuous interaction of the
trusted entity during the process, increasing the delay for the communication
and reducing security due to the large number of message exchanges. In this
paper, we propose a secure, computationally lightweight, unified protocol for
fast authentication and billing that provides on-demand dynamic charging to
comprehensively deal with all the computational and security constraints. The
protocol employs an ID-based public encryption scheme to manage mutual
authentication and pseudonyms to preserve the user's identity across multiple
charging processes. Compared to state-of-the-art authentication protocols, our
proposal overcomes the problem of overwhelming interactions and provides public
scheme security against the use of simple operations in wide open

  Implications",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms on Ethereum are booming, and
numerous traders are trying to capitalize on the opportunity for maximizing
their benefits by launching front-running attacks and extracting Miner
Extractable Values (MEVs) based on information in the public mempool. To
protect end users from being harmed and hide transactions from the mempool,
private transactions, a special type of transactions that are sent directly to
miners, were invented. Private transactions have a high probability of being
packed to the front positions of a block and being added to the blockchain by
the target miner, without going through the public mempool, thus reducing the
risk of being attacked by malicious entities.
  Despite the good intention of inventing private transactions, due to their
stealthy nature, private transactions have also been used by attackers to
launch attacks, which has a negative impact on the Ethereum ecosystem. However,
existing works only touch upon private transactions as by-products when
studying MEV, while a systematic study on private transactions is still
missing. To fill this gap and paint a complete picture of private transactions,
we take the first step towards investigating the private transactions on
Ethereum. In particular, we collect large-scale private transaction datasets
and perform analysis on their characteristics, transaction costs and miner
profits, as well as security impacts. This work provides deep insights on
different aspects of private transactions.

probability of spreading to a new individual is a non-linear function of the

that is spreading is subject to game theoretical considerations (e.g. for
choices of strategy or behavior) or psychological effects such as social
reinforcement and other forms of peer influence (e.g. for ideas, preferences,

contagions are affected by the underlying network structure. Motivated by
simulations of complex epidemics on real social networks, we present a general
framework for analyzing the statistics of contagions with arbitrary non-linear
adoption probabilities based on the mathematical tools of population genetics.
Our framework provides a unified approach that illustrates intuitively several
key properties of complex contagions: stronger community structure and network
sparsity can significantly enhance the spread, while broad degree distributions
dampen the effect of selection. Finally, we show that some structural features
can exhibit critical values that demarcate regimes where global epidemics
become possible for networks of arbitrary size. Our results draw parallels
between the competition of genes in a population and memes in a world of minds

the help of the developed MHD model, the structure of an accretion disk of a
solar mass T Tauri star is simulated for different accretion rates $\dot{M}$
and dust grain sizes $a_d$. The simulations of the radial structure of the disk
show that the magnetic field in the disk is kinematic, and the electromagnetic
force does not affect the rotation speed of the gas for typical values
$\dot{M}=10^{-8}\,M_\odot\,\mbox{yr}^{-1}$ and $a_d=0.1 \mu$m. In the case of
large dust grains, $a_d\geq 1$ mm, the magnetic field is frozen into the gas
and a dynamically strong magnetic field is generated at radial distances from
the star $r\gtrsim 30$ au, the tensions of which slow down the rotation speed
by $\lesssim 1.5$ % of the Keplerian velocity. This effect is comparable to the
contribution of the radial gradient of gas pressure and can lead to the
increase in the radial drift velocity of dust grains in the accretion disks. In
the case of high accretion rate, $\dot{M}\geq
10^{-7}\,M_\odot\,\mbox{yr}^{-1}$, the magnetic field is also dynamically
strong in the inner region of the disk, $r<0.2$ au. The simulations of the
vertical structure of the disk show that, depending on the conditions on the
surface of the disk, the vertical gradient of magnetic pressure can lead to
both decrease and increase in the characteristic thickness of the disk as
compared to the hydrostatic one by 5-20 %. The change in the thickness of the
disk occurs outside the region of low ionization fraction and effective
magnetic diffusion (`dead' zone), which extends from $r=0.3$ to $20$ au at

valuable throughout the domain of earth science for their ability to simulate
sampled study data. Such stochastic methods have also been adopted into other
fields outside of geostatistics domains, especially within the computing and

primarily consisted of stationary methods due to their brisk simulation speed
and mathematical simplicity. However, advances in modern computing now allow
for the implementation of more advanced non-stationary simulation methods,
consisting of multiple varying structures, and allowing for much more accurate
and realistic simulations. As some of these calculations may still be slow, the
application of machine learning techniques, namely the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) can be used to surpass previous simulation generation speeds and
allows for greater parameterization. This work presents three stochastic
simulation methods: stochastic simulation using non-stationary covariance,
multipoint simulation, and conditional GANs. An SPDE method was used as a
benchmark comparison. Experiments using synthetic data are used to showcase the
effectiveness of each of these methods at maintaining non-stationary structures

attracted tons of attentions recently from both industry and academia.
Different from the conventional feature-based explanations (e.g.,

flip model decisions with minimal perturbations on queries. Given valid
counterfactuals, humans are capable of reasoning under ``what-if''
circumstances, so as to better understand the model decision boundaries.
However, releasing counterfactuals could be detrimental, since it may
unintentionally leak sensitive information to adversaries, which brings about
higher risks on both model security and data privacy. To bridge the gap, in
this paper, we propose a novel framework to generate differentially private
counterfactual (DPC) without touching the deployed model or explanation set,
where noises are injected for protection while maintaining the explanation
roles of counterfactual. In particular, we train an autoencoder with the
functional mechanism to construct noisy class prototypes, and then derive the
DPC from the latent prototypes based on the post-processing immunity of
differential privacy. Further evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the

by security experts, focusing on hard disk recovery, a type of non-volatile
memory. Unfortunately, none of the existing research, neither from academia,
industry, or government, have ever considered data recovery from volatile
memories. The data is lost when it is powered off, by definition. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to present an approach to recovering data
from a static random access memory. It is conventional wisdom that SRAM loses
its contents whenever it turns off, and it is not required to protect sensitive
information, e.g., the firmware code, secret encryption keys, etc., when an
SRAM-based computing system retires. Unfortunately, the recycling of integrated
circuits poses a severe threat to the protection of intellectual properties. In
this paper, we present a novel concept to retrieve SRAM data as aging leads to
a power-up state with an imprint of the stored values. We show that our
proposed approaches can partially recover the previously used SRAM content. The
accuracy of the recovered data can be further increased by incorporating
multiple SRAM chips compared to a single one. It is impossible to retrieve the
prior content of some stable SRAM cells, where aging shifts these cells towards
stability. As the locations of these cells vary from chip to chip due to
uncontrollable process variation, the same cell has a higher chance of being
unstable or stable against aging in any of the chips, which helps us recover
the content. Finally, majority voting is used to combine a set of SRAM chips'
data to recover the stored data. We present our experimental result using
commercial off-the-shelf SRAMs with stored binary image data before performing
accelerated aging. We demonstrate the successful partial retrieval on SRAMs

approaches used in optical spectroscopy, we determined stellar parameters from
a combination of line-depth ratios and the equivalent width of a CO line. The
stellar parameters of the stars follow the common trends of nearby APOGEE stars
in a similar magnitude range. We also determined the abundances of Fe, Na, Mg,
Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, and Ce through spectrum synthesis. There is no

For a potential donor, a larger audience constitutes higher reputational

trust that the partner will be cooperative. This idea can be used for an

the per-pixel performance discrepancy over multi-scale density maps. In this
work, we redesign the multi-scale neural network by introducing a hierarchical
mixture of density experts, which hierarchically merges multi-scale density
maps for crowd counting. Within the hierarchical structure, an expert
competition and collaboration scheme is presented to encourage contributions
from all scales; pixel-wise soft gating nets are introduced to provide
pixel-wise soft weights for scale combinations in different hierarchies. The
network is optimized using both the crowd density map and the local counting
map, where the latter is obtained by local integration on the former.
Optimizing both can be problematic because of their potential conflicts. We
introduce a new relative local counting loss based on relative count
differences among hard-predicted local regions in an image, which proves to be
complementary to the conventional absolute error loss on the density map.
Experiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on
five public datasets, i.e. ShanghaiTech, UCF_CC_50, JHU-CROWD++, NWPU-Crowd and
Trancos.

oxygen transport within the placenta and has emerged as a promising tool to

segmenting the placenta in each volume of the time series. Due to the large
number of volumes in the BOLD time series, existing studies rely on
registration to map all volumes to a manually segmented template. As the
placenta can undergo large deformation due to fetal motion, maternal motion,

machine learning model based on a U-Net neural network architecture to
automatically segment the placenta in BOLD MRI and apply it to segmenting each
volume in a time series. We use a boundary-weighted loss function to accurately
capture the placental shape. Our model is trained and tested on a cohort of 91
subjects containing healthy fetuses, fetuses with fetal growth restriction, and
mothers with high BMI. We achieve a Dice score of 0.83+/-0.04 when matching

ground glass turbidity is the most common finding that requires specialist
diagnosis. Based on this situation, some researchers propose the relevant DL
models which can replace professional diagnostic specialists in clinics when
lacking expertise. However, although DL methods have a stunning performance in
medical image processing, the limited datasets can be a challenge in developing
the accuracy of diagnosis at the human level. In addition, deep learning
algorithms face the challenge of classifying and segmenting medical images in
three or even multiple dimensions and maintaining high accuracy rates.
Consequently, with a guaranteed high level of accuracy, our model can classify
the patients' CT images into three types: Normal, Pneumonia and COVID.
Subsequently, two datasets are used for segmentation, one of the datasets even
has only a limited amount of data (20 cases). Our system combined the
classification model and the segmentation model together, a fully integrated
diagnostic model was built on the basis of ResNet50 and 3D U-Net algorithm. By
feeding with different datasets, the COVID image segmentation of the infected
area will be carried out according to classification results. Our model
achieves 94.52% accuracy in the classification of lung lesions by 3 types:
COVID, Pneumonia and Normal. For future medical use, embedding the model into
the medical facilities might be an efficient way of assisting or substituting
doctors with diagnoses, therefore, a broader range of the problem of variant

using a large number of training samples, in which the pixelwise annotations

a novel unsupervised learning paradigm by integrating an end-to-end deep

segmentation. This constraint aims to centralise the components of deep mixture
models during the calculation of the optimisation function. In so doing, the
redundant or empty class issues, which are common in current unsupervised

significantly (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) better performance (with the average

type field - valley field. A theoretical framework - valley field mechanics
thus arises to address the local physics and opens a path to local valley
control. Numerical and analytical results are presented for various structures.
A spectrum of novel local phenomena are revealed with characteristics in
apparent contradiction to valley flavor-based expectations or constraints,
enabling flexible valley control - for example, both symmetry and material
restrictions previously established are relaxed, with gapless, single-layer
graphene, a material with inversion symmetry now added to the material list for
a relatively simple realization of valleytronics. Non-valley targeted

However, translating instructions and commands towards robotic motion
generation and deployment in the real world is far from being an easy task. The
challenge of combining a robot's inherent low-level geometric and kinodynamic
constraints with a human's high-level semantic instructions traditionally is
solved using task-specific solutions with little generalizability between
hardware platforms, often with the use of static sets of target actions and

allows a user to modify generic robotic trajectories. Our method leverages
pre-trained language models (BERT and CLIP) to encode the user's intent and
target objects directly from a free-form text input and scene images, fuses
geometrical features generated by a transformer encoder network, and finally
outputs trajectories using a transformer decoder, without the need of priors
related to the task or robot information. We significantly extend our own
previous work presented in Bucker et al. by expanding the trajectory
parametrization space to 3D and velocity as opposed to just XY movements. In
addition, we now train the model to use actual images of the objects in the

  Optimal Fingerprinting","36 pages, 13 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Regression-based optimal fingerprinting techniques for climate change
detection and attribution require the estimation of the forced signal as well
as the internal variability covariance matrix in order to distinguish between
their influences in the observational record. While previously developed
approaches have taken into account the uncertainty linked to the estimation of
the forced signal, there has been less focus on uncertainty in the covariance
matrix describing natural variability, despite the fact that the specification
of this covariance matrix is known to meaningfully impact the results. Here we
propose a Bayesian optimal fingerprinting framework using a Laplacian basis
function parameterization of the covariance matrix. This parameterization,
unlike traditional methods based on principal components, does not require the
basis vectors themselves to be estimated from climate model data, which allows
for the uncertainty in estimating the covariance structure to be propagated to
the optimal fingerprinting regression parameter. We show through a CMIP6
validation study that this proposed approach achieves better-calibrated
coverage rates of the true regression parameter than principal component-based
approaches. When applied to HadCRUT observational data, the proposed approach
detects anthropogenic warming with higher confidence levels, and with lower
variability over the choice of climate models, than principal-component-based
approaches.

phenomena whereby past events increase the probability of the occurrence of
future events. This work presents a flexible approach for modelling a variant
of these, namely discrete-time Hawkes processes. Most standard models of Hawkes
processes rely on a parametric form for the function describing the influence
of past events, referred to as the triggering kernel. This is likely to be
insufficient to capture the true excitation pattern, particularly for complex
data. By utilising trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo inference
techniques, our proposed model for the triggering kernel can take the form of
any step function, affording significantly more flexibility than a parametric
form. We first demonstrate the utility of the proposed model through a
comprehensive simulation study. This includes univariate scenarios, and
multivariate scenarios whereby there are multiple interacting Hawkes processes.
We then apply the proposed model to several case studies: the interaction
between two countries during the early to middle stages of the COVID-19
pandemic, taking Italy and France as an example, and the interaction of
terrorist activity between two countries in close spatial proximity, Indonesia
and the Philippines, and then within three regions of the Philippines.

gravitational waves induced by a particle plunging into a Kerr black hole and
study the excitation of multiple quasi-normal (QN) modes. We find that the
start time of ringdown is before the strain peak of the signal and corresponds
to the time when the particle passes the photon sphere. When the black hole has
the near-extremal rotation, the Kerr QN frequencies are close to the fermionic
Matsubara frequencies with the Hawking temperature and the chemical potential
of the superradiant frequency. We indeed find that the absolute square of the
spectral amplitude apparently follows the Fermi-Dirac distribution with the
chemical potential of around the real QN frequency of the fundamental mode.
Fitting the Boltzmann distribution to the data in higher frequencies, the
best-fit temperature is found out to be close to the Hawking temperature,

gravitational-wave spectrum exhibits a would-be Fermi degeneracy with the Fermi
surface at the superradiant frequency $\omega = \mu_{\rm H}$. We show that the

the Fermi-Dirac distribution. As the greybody factor is another no-hair
quantity of black holes, this opens a new possibility that we can test general
relativity by observationally searching for the Boltzmann distribution in
$\omega \gtrsim \mu_{\rm H}$ without extracting QN modes from ringdown. We
could measure the mass and angular momentum of ringing black holes and could
probe the Kerr/CFT by measuring the greybody factor imprinted on the ringdown

effects of production in various industries, green supply chain management
(GSCM) has attracted the attention of both scholars and practitioners. Green
supplier selection is one of the most important problems in GSCM, which
satisfies a firm's environmental goals as well as its economic targets. In this
paper, for the first time, a green supplier selection problem considering both
green and non-green evaluation criteria in a closed-loop supply chain is
studied, and a cap-and-trade mechanism as a way of controlling the air
pollution caused by manufacturers is proposed. To solve the described problem,
a multi-objective robust optimization (RO) model, as an effective approach to
handle uncertainty, is proposed. A numerical example using randomly generated
data, accompanied by the analysis based on the proposed approach is elaborated
to validate the presented model. The results prove that the developed model for
green supplier selection is able to effectively enhance the decision-making
process of the experts. By illustrating the trade-off in robustness between the
model and proposed solutions, as well as the effect of the deviation penalty on
the closeness of results to the achieved solution, we show how firms can make
optimal decisions when assigning the parameters. Furthermore, analyses show
that allowance amount (cap) and allowance prices in the cap-and-trade system
impact the firms' costs and the amount of carbon released. Finally, we show
that the cap-and-trade mechanism results in a better solution in terms of the
total utility of the supply chain compared to the penalty-based system.

provide the most accurate gravitational wave predictions, but at a high
computational cost -- especially when the black holes have nearly extremal
spins (i.e. spins near the theoretical upper limit) or very unequal masses.
Recently, the technique of Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) has enabled the
construction of surrogate models trained on an existing set of NR waveforms.
Surrogate models enable the rapid computation of the gravitational waves
emitted by BBHs. Typically these models are used for interpolation to compute
gravitational waveforms for BBHs with mass ratios and spins within the bounds
of the training set. Because simulations with nearly extremal spins are so
technically challenging, surrogate models almost always rely on training sets
with only moderate spins. In this paper, we explore how well surrogate models
can extrapolate to nearly extremal spins when the training set only includes
moderate spins. For simplicity, we focus on one-dimensional surrogate models
trained on NR simulations of BBHs with equal masses and equal, aligned spins.
We assess the performance of the surrogate models at higher spin magnitudes by
calculating the mismatches between extrapolated surrogate model waveforms and
NR waveforms, by calculating the differences between extrapolated and NR
measurements of the remnant black-hole mass, and by testing how the surrogate
model improves as the training set extends to higher spins. We find that while
extrapolation in this one-dimensional case is viable for current detector
sensitivities, surrogate models for next-generation detectors should use
training sets that extend to nearly extremal spins.

disorder. Using numerical simulations, we find a rich variety of transport
phenomena as a function of charge density, drive, and pinning strength. For
weak pinning, the system forms a defect free crystal that depins elastically.
When the pinning is stronger, a pinned glass phase appears that depins into a
filamentary flow state, transitions at higher drives into a disordered flow
phase, and finally forms a moving smectic. Within the filamentary flow phase,
the conduction curves can show switching dynamics as well as negative
differential conductivity in which switching events cause some flow channels to
be blocked. The velocity noise in the filamentary flow regime exhibits narrow
band characteristics due to the one-dimensional nature of the motion, while the
moving smectic has narrow band velocity noise with a washboard frequency. In
the disordered flow state, the noise power reaches a peak value and the noise
has a $1/f$ character. Our transport results are consistent with recent
experimental transport studies in systems where Wigner crystal states are
believed to be occurring. Below the conduction threshold, we find that
avalanches with a power law size distribution appear when there are sudden

younger sources may drive stronger jets or winds. Overall, we observe
variations in the proportion of each profile type and in the line properties

high-directional beams and overcome severe attenuation. Narrow beams require

tightly coupled and eliminate the overhead associated with realignment. Hence,
with periodic measurements, beams are adjusted before they lose alignment. We
propose a model where the receiver adjusts beam direction ""continuously"" over

updated using the estimate of the variation rate of beam angles via two
different methods, a Continuous-Discrete Kalman filter and an MMSE of a

overhead in pilots, yet, the performance of beam tracking is improved

reducing the MSE of the beam directions. In addition, our approach reduces the

models. One of the most widely-used approaches for tackling imbalanced data is
re-weighting, where training samples are associated with different weights in
the loss function. Most of existing re-weighting approaches treat the example
weights as the learnable parameter and optimize the weights on the meta set,
entailing expensive bilevel optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel
re-weighting method based on optimal transport (OT) from a distributional point
of view. Specifically, we view the training set as an imbalanced distribution
over its samples, which is transported by OT to a balanced distribution
obtained from the meta set. The weights of the training samples are the
probability mass of the imbalanced distribution and learned by minimizing the
OT distance between the two distributions. Compared with existing methods, our
proposed one disengages the dependence of the weight learning on the concerned
classifier at each iteration. Experiments on image, text and point cloud
datasets demonstrate that our proposed re-weighting method has excellent
performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in many cases and providing a
promising tool for addressing the imbalanced classification issue.

rank-based losses for MLC, ZLPR can handel problems that the number of target
labels is uncertain, which, in this point of view, makes it equally capable
with the other two strategies often used in MLC, namely the binary relevance
(BR) and the label powerset (LP). Additionally, ZLPR takes the corelation
between labels into consideration, which makes it more comprehensive than the
BR methods. In terms of computational complexity, ZLPR can compete with the BR
methods because its prediction is also label-independent, which makes it take
less time and memory than the LP methods. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of ZLPR on multiple benchmark datasets and multiple evaluation

  Image Colorization","16 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nighttime thermal infrared (NTIR) image colorization, also known as
translation of NTIR images into daytime color images (NTIR2DC), is a promising
research direction to facilitate nighttime scene perception for humans and
intelligent systems under unfavorable conditions (e.g., complete darkness).
However, previously developed methods have poor colorization performance for
small sample classes. Moreover, reducing the high confidence noise in
pseudo-labels and addressing the problem of image gradient disappearance during
translation are still under-explored, and keeping edges from being distorted
during translation is also challenging. To address the aforementioned issues,
we propose a novel learning framework called Memory-guided cOllaboRative
atteNtion Generative Adversarial Network (MornGAN), which is inspired by the
analogical reasoning mechanisms of humans. Specifically, a memory-guided sample
selection strategy and adaptive collaborative attention loss are devised to
enhance the semantic preservation of small sample categories. In addition, we
propose an online semantic distillation module to mine and refine the
pseudo-labels of NTIR images. Further, conditional gradient repair loss is
introduced for reducing edge distortion during translation. Extensive
experiments on the NTIR2DC task show that the proposed MornGAN significantly
outperforms other image-to-image translation methods in terms of semantic
preservation and edge consistency, which helps improve the object detection
accuracy remarkably.

quasi-Einstein equation on a closed manifold $M$, where $g$ is a Riemannian
metric and $X$ is a closed 1-form. It is known that when the cosmological
constant vanishes, there is rigidity: $X$ vanishes and consequently $g$ is
Ricci flat. We study this form of rigidity for all signs of the cosmological
constant. It has been asserted that this rigidity also holds when the
cosmological constant is negative, but we exhibit a counter-example. We show
that for negative cosmological constant if $X$ does not vanish identically, it
must be incompressible, have constant norm, and be nontrivial in cohomology,
and $(M,g)$ must have constant scalar curvature and zero Euler characteristic.
If the cosmological constant is positive, $X$ must be exact (and vanishing if
$\dim M=2$). Our results apply more generally to a broad class of
quasi-Einstein equations on closed manifolds. We extend some known results for
quasi-Einstein metrics with exact 1-form $X$ to the closed $X$ case. We
consider near horizon geometries for which the vacuum condition is relaxed
somewhat to allow for the presence of a limited class of matter fields. An

plumes constantly emerge from random locations on the equator and dissipate on
the bubble.In the SPR, the flow is dominated by a single large and stable plume
rising from the lower edge of the bubble.The scaling behaviour of the Nusselt

(BLR), and measure the mass of supermassive black hole in NGC~4151, we perform
a seven-month photometric and spectroscopic monitoring program in 2020--2021,
using the 2.4 m telescope at Lijiang Observatory. We successfully measure the
time lags of the responses from broad \ha, \hb, \hg, \hei, and \heii\ emission
lines to continuum variation, which are $7.63_{-2.62}^{+1.85}$,
$6.21_{-1.13}^{+1.41}$, $5.67_{-1.94}^{+1.65}$, $1.59_{-1.11}^{+0.86}$, and
$0.46_{-1.06}^{+1.22}$ days, respectively, following radial stratification. The
ratios of time lags among these lines are $1.23 : 1.00 : 0.91 : 0.26 : 0.07$.
We find that the continuum lag between the ultraviolet and optical bands can
significantly affect the lag measurements of \hei\ and \heii. Virial and
infalling gas motions coexist in this campaign, which is different from
previous results, implying the evolutionary kinematics of BLR. Based on our
measurements and previous ones in the literature, we confirm that the BLR of
NGC~4151 is basically virialized. Finally, we compute the black hole mass
through multiple lines, and the measurement from \hb\ to be $
3.94_{-0.72}^{+0.90} \times 10^7 M_{\odot}$, which is consistent with previous

loops. In the limit in which all fields are degenerate in mass, the vacuum
energy $V_{\rm O}$ can be wholly expressed in terms of $G$ and $c_{\rm O}$. We
parametrize deviation from this degenerate limit by a parameter ${\hat \alpha}$
such that the black hole spacetime is dS for ${\hat \alpha} < 1$ and AdS for
${\hat \alpha} > 1$. In constraining the symmergent parameters $c_{\rm O}$ and
${\hat \alpha}$, we utilize the EHT observations on the M87* and Sgr. A* black
holes. We investigate first the modifications in the photon sphere and shadow
size, and find significant deviations in the photonsphere radius and the shadow
radius with respect to the Kerr solution. We also find that the geodesics of
time-like particles are more sensitive to symmergent gravity effects than the
null geodesics. Finally, we analyze the weak field limit of the deflection
angle, where we use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for taking into account the finite
distance of the source and the receiver to the lensing object. Remarkably, the
distance of the receiver (or source) from the lensing object greatly influences
the deflection angle. Moreover, $c_{\rm O}$ needs be negative for a consistent
solution. In our analysis, the rotating black hole acts as a particle
accelerator and possesses the sensitivity to probe the symmergent gravity.

machine-learning based deep potential, we trace both of the phenomena in ZrW2O8
back to a common atomistic origin, where the nonbridging O atoms play a
critical role. We demonstrate that the nonbridging O atoms confer great
flexibility to vibration of polyhedrons, and kinetically drive volume shrinking
on heating, or NTE. In addition, beyond a certain critical pressure, we find
that the migration of nonbridging O atoms leads to additional bond formation
that lowers the potential energy, suggesting that the PIA is a potential-driven
first-order phase transition. Most importantly, we identify a second critical
pressure beyond which the amorphous phase of ZrW2O8 undergoes a hidden phase
transition from a reversible phase to an irreversible one.

(2DEG) at $LaInO_{3}$(LIO)/$BaSnO_{3}$(BSO) interfaces is understood to
originate from a polarization discontinuity at the interface and the conduction
band offset between LIO and BSO. In this scenario, the direction of
polarization at the interface is determined by whether the first atomic LIO
layer at the interface is LaO$^{+}$ or InO$_{2}^{-}$. We investigate the role
of the terminating layer at the LIO/BSO interface in creating the 2DEG. Based
on conductance measurements of our in-situ grown LIO/BSO heterostructures, we
report in this work that the 2DEG only forms when the BSO surface is terminated
with a SnO$_{2}$ layer. We controlled the terminating layer by additional
SnO$_{2}$ deposition on the BSO surface. We show that the as-grown BSO surface
has a mixed terminating layer of BaO and SnO$_{2}$ while the BSO surfaces
prepared with additional SnO$_{2}$ deposition are terminated mainly with the
SnO$_{2}$ layer. The terminating layer was confirmed by coaxial impact
collision ion scattering spectroscopy (CAICISS). Our finding is consistent with
the interface polarization model for 2DEG formation at LIO/BSO interfaces, in
which the direction of the interfacial polarization in LIO is determined by the
terminating layer of the BSO surface.

implement a novel fast theta-join algorithm, called Prefap, by developing two
distinct techniques - prefiltering and amalgamated partitioning-based on the
state-of-the-art FastThetaJoin algorithm to optimize the efficiency of the
theta-join operation. Firstly, we develop a prefiltering strategy before data
streams are partitioned to reduce the amount of data to be involved and benefit
a more fine-grained partitioning. Secondly, to avoid the data streams being
partitioned in a coarse-grained isolated manner and improve the quality of the
partition-level filtering, we introduce an amalgamated partitioning mechanism
that can amalgamate the partitioning boundaries of two data streams to assist a
fine-grained partitioning. With the integration of these two techniques into
the existing FastThetaJoin algorithm, we design and implement a new framework
to achieve a decreased number of Cartesian products and a higher theta-join
efficiency. By comparing with existing algorithms, FastThetaJoin in particular,
we evaluate the performance of Prefap on both synthetic and real data streams

linear system with matched nonlinear uncertainties that can depend on both time
and states, subject to both state and input constraints. The proposed framework
leverages an L1 adaptive controller (L1AC) that estimates and compensates for
the uncertainties, and provides guaranteed transient performance, in terms of
uniform bounds on the error between actual states and inputs and those of a
nominal (i.e., uncertainty-free) system. The uniform performance bounds
provided by the L1AC are used to tighten the pre-specified state and control
constraints. A reference governor is then designed for the nominal system using
the tightened constraints, and guarantees robust constraint satisfaction.
Moreover, the conservatism introduced by the constraint tightening can be
systematically reduced by tuning some parameters within the L1AC. Compared with
existing solutions, the proposed adaptive RG framework can potentially yield
less conservative results for constraint enforcement due to the removal of
uncertainty propagation along a prediction horizon, and improved tracking
performance due to the inherent uncertainty compensation mechanism. Simulation
results for a flight control example illustrate the efficacy of the proposed
framework.

deployment of satellite technologies. The data facilitates research in
ecological monitoring, land management and desertification, etc. The
characteristics of RS data (e.g., enormous volume, large single-file size and
demanding requirement of fault tolerance) make the Hadoop Distributed File
System (HDFS) an ideal choice for RS data storage as it is efficient, scalable
and equipped with a data replication mechanism for failure resilience. To use
RS data, one of the most important techniques is geospatial indexing. However,
the large data volume makes it time-consuming to efficiently construct and
leverage. Considering that most modern geospatial data centres are equipped
with HDFS-based big data processing infrastructures, deploying multiple
geospatial indices becomes natural to optimise the efficacy. Moreover, because
of the reliability introduced by high-quality hardware and the infrequently
modified property of the RS data, the use of multi-indexing will not cause
large overhead. Therefore, we design a framework called Multi-IndeXing-RS
(MIX-RS) that unifies the multi-indexing mechanism on top of the HDFS with data
replication enabled for both fault tolerance and geospatial indexing
efficiency. Given the fault tolerance provided by the HDFS, RS data is
structurally stored inside for faster geospatial indexing. Additionally,
multi-indexing enhances efficiency. The proposed technique naturally sits on
top of the HDFS to form a holistic framework without incurring severe overhead
or sophisticated system implementation efforts. The MIX-RS framework is
implemented and evaluated using real remote sensing data provided by the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, demonstrating excellent geospatial indexing
performance.

for linear systems of equations arising from discretized partial differential

problem size. This capability is crucial at the present, where the increasing
availability of massive HPC platforms pushes for the solution of very large
problems. The key for a rapidly converging AMG method is a good interplay
between the smoother and the coarse-grid correction, which in turn requires the
use of an effective prolongation. From a theoretical viewpoint, the
prolongation must accurately represent near kernel components and, at the same
time, be bounded in the energy norm. For challenging problems, however,
ensuring both these requirements is not easy and is exactly the goal of this
work. We propose a constrained minimization procedure aimed at reducing
prolongation energy while preserving the near kernel components in the span of
interpolation. The proposed algorithm is based on previous energy minimization
approaches utilizing a preconditioned restricted conjugate gradients method,
but has new features and a specific focus on parallel performance and

on the incomplete multi-view data with partial view missing, has received more
and more attention in recent years. Although numerous methods have been
developed, most of the methods either cannot flexibly handle the incomplete
multi-view data with arbitrary missing views or do not consider the negative
factor of information imbalance among views. Moreover, some methods do not
fully explore the local structure of all incomplete views. To tackle these
problems, this paper proposes a simple but effective method, named localized
sparse incomplete multi-view clustering (LSIMVC). Different from the existing
methods, LSIMVC intends to learn a sparse and structured consensus latent
representation from the incomplete multi-view data by optimizing a sparse
regularized and novel graph embedded multi-view matrix factorization model.
Specifically, in such a novel model based on the matrix factorization, a l1
norm based sparse constraint is introduced to obtain the sparse low-dimensional
individual representations and the sparse consensus representation. Moreover, a
novel local graph embedding term is introduced to learn the structured
consensus representation. Different from the existing works, our local graph
embedding term aggregates the graph embedding task and consensus representation
learning task into a concise term. Furthermore, to reduce the imbalance factor
of incomplete multi-view learning, an adaptive weighted learning scheme is
introduced to LSIMVC. Finally, an efficient optimization strategy is given to
solve the optimization problem of our proposed model. Comprehensive
experimental results performed on six incomplete multi-view databases verify
that the performance of our LSIMVC is superior to the state-of-the-art IMC
approaches. The code is available in https://github.com/justsmart/LSIMVC.

conflicts with the goal of obtaining an L2 architecture whose security relies

adversarial behavior such as withholding data upon request. We then analyze the
interaction of rational DAC nodes and clients as a dynamic game, with a

design a graph network called Cooperation Graph (CG). The Cooperation Graph is
the combination of two simple bipartite graphs, namely, the Agent Clustering

novel graph structure, we propose a Cooperation Graph Multiagent Reinforcement

function of an autonomous unit. Here, we realize self-propelling colloidal
clusters which behave as simple finite state machines, i.e. systems built to
possess a finite number of internal states connected by reversible transitions
and associated to distinct functions. We produce these units via capillary
assembly combining hard polystyrene colloids with two different types of
thermo-responsive microgels. The clusters, actuated by spatially uniform AC
electric fields, adapt their shape and dielectric properties, and consequently
their propulsion, via reversible temperature-induced transitions controlled by
light. The different transition temperatures for the two microgels enable three
distinct dynamical states corresponding to three illumination intensity levels.
The sequential reconfiguration of the microgels affects the velocity and shape
of the active trajectories according to a pathway defined by tailoring the
clusters' geometry during assembly. The demonstration of these simple systems
indicates an exciting route to build more complex units with broader
reconfiguration schemes and multiple responses towards the realization of
autonomous systems with physical intelligence at the colloidal scale.

a function of time to coalescence. For representative masses of the IMBBHs, we
synthesize a population of binaries uniformly located and oriented on a sphere

distillation. First, we observe that the massive teacher achieves a higher
proportion of harmonious predictions than the lightweight student. Based on
this intriguing observation, a novel Harmony Score (HS) is devised to estimate
the alignment of classification and regression qualities. HS models the

why the medical segmentation is typically annotated by a group of clinical
experts to mitigate the personal bias. However, this clinical routine also
brings new challenges to the application of machine learning algorithms.
Without a definite ground-truth, it will be difficult to train and evaluate the
deep learning models. When the annotations are collected from different
graders, a common choice is majority vote. However such a strategy ignores the
difference between the grader expertness. In this paper, we consider the task
of predicting the segmentation with the calibrated inter-observer uncertainty.
We note that in clinical practice, the medical image segmentation is usually
used to assist the disease diagnosis. Inspired by this observation, we propose
diagnosis-first principle, which is to take disease diagnosis as the criterion
to calibrate the inter-observer segmentation uncertainty. Following this idea,
a framework named Diagnosis First segmentation Framework (DiFF) is proposed to
estimate diagnosis-first segmentation from the raw images.Specifically, DiFF
will first learn to fuse the multi-rater segmentation labels to a single
ground-truth which could maximize the disease diagnosis performance. We dubbed
the fused ground-truth as Diagnosis First Ground-truth (DF-GT).Then, we further
propose Take and Give Modelto segment DF-GT from the raw image. We verify the
effectiveness of DiFF on three different medical segmentation tasks: OD/OC
segmentation on fundus images, thyroid nodule segmentation on ultrasound
images, and skin lesion segmentation on dermoscopic images. Experimental
results show that the proposed DiFF is able to significantly facilitate the
corresponding disease diagnosis, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art
multi-rater learning methods.

policy to mitigate the effects of climate change. However, the automation of
urban scale building energy modeling systems required to meet global urban

One such point of uniqueness between cities is that of urban microclimate,
which may play a major role in altering the performance of energy efficiency in
buildings. This research proposes a way to rapidly collect urban microclimate
data through the utilization of satellite readings and climate reanalysis. We
then demonstrate the potential utility of this data by composing an analysis
against three years of monthly building energy consumption data from New York
City. As a whole, microclimate in New York City may be responsible for large
swings in urban energy consumption. We estimate that Central Park may reduce
the electricity consumption of adjacent buildings by 5-10%, while vegetation
overall seems to have no appreciable impact on gas consumption. We find that
favorable urban microclimates may decrease the gas consumption of some
buildings in New York by 71% while others may increase gas consumption by as
much as 221%. Additionally, microclimates may be responsible for the decrease
of electricity consumption by 28.6% in regions or increases of 77% consumption
in others. This work provides a method of curating global, high resolution
microclimate data, allowing researchers to explore the invisible walls of urban
microclimate which interact with the buildings around them.

to use relative annotation, which compares the severity level between image
pairs. By using a learning-to-rank framework with relative annotation, we can
train a neural network that estimates rank scores that are relative to severity

set constraints on the speed of sound in the interior of neutron stars, based
on recent multi-messenger data in combination with limiting conditions from
nuclear physics at low densities. Two general parametric representations are
introduced for the sound speed $c_s$ in order to examine the independence with
respect to choices for the parametrisation of Priors. Credible regions for
neutron star properties are analysed, in particular with reference to the quest
for possible phase transitions in cold dense matter. The evaluation of Bayes
factors implies extreme evidence for a violation of the conformal bound, $c_s^2
\leq 1/3$, inside neutron stars. Given the presently existing data base, it can
be concluded that the occurrence of a first-order phase transition in the core
of even a two-solar-mass neutron star is unlikely, while a continuous crossover
cannot be ruled out. At the same time it is pointed out that the discovery of a
superheavy neutron star with a mass $ M \sim 2.3 - 2.4\, M_\odot$ would
strengthen evidence for a phase change in the deep interior of the star.

far outside of mathematics. Cantor's 1874 proof of the uncountability of

historical milestone. In this paper, we study the uncountability of
$\mathbb{R}$ in Kohlenbach's higher-order Reverse Mathematics (RM for short),
in the guise of the following principle: $$\hbox{for a countable set $A\subset

conceptual observation is that the usual definition of countable set -- based
on injections or bijections to $\mathbb{N}$ -- does not seem suitable for the
RM-study of mainstream mathematics; we also propose a suitable (equivalent over
strong systems) alternative definition of countable set, namely union over
$\mathbb{N}$ of finite sets; the latter is known from the literature and closer
to how countable sets occur 'in the wild'. We identify a considerable number of
theorems that are equivalent to the centred theorem based on our alternative
definition. Perhaps surprisingly, our equivalent theorems involve most basic
properties of the Riemann integral, regulated or bounded variation functions,
Blumberg's theorem, and Volterra's early work circa 1881. Our equivalences are
also robust, promoting the uncountability of $\mathbb{R}$ to the status of
'big' system in RM.

diseases with no obvious structural lesions. To date, most deep-learning-based
fMRI studies have employed functional connectivity (FC) as the basic feature
for disease classification. However, FC is calculated on time series of
predefined regions of interest and neglects detailed information contained in
each voxel. Another drawback of using FC is the limited sample size for the
training of deep models. The low representation ability of FC leads to poor
performance in clinical practice, especially when dealing with multimodal
medical data involving multiple types of visual signals and textual records for
brain diseases. To overcome this bottleneck problem in the fMRI feature
modality, we propose BrainFormer, an end-to-end functional interaction learning
method for brain disease classification with single fMRI volume. Unlike
traditional deep learning methods that construct convolution and transformers
on FC, BrainFormer learns the functional interaction from fMRI signals, by
modeling the local cues within each voxel with 3D convolutions and capturing
the global correlations among distant regions with specially designed global
attention mechanisms from shallow layers to deep layers. Meanwhile, BrainFormer
can deal with multimodal medical data including fMRI volume, structural MRI, FC
features and phenotypic data to achieve more comprehensive brain disease
diagnosis. We evaluate BrainFormer on five independent multi-site datasets on
autism, Alzheimer's disease, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder and headache disorders. The results demonstrate its effectiveness and
generalizability for multiple brain diseases diagnosis with multimodal
features. BrainFormer may promote precision of neuroimaging-based diagnosis in

its bandgap magnitude and the effect on the thermal conductivity which could
increase the efficiency of the thermoelectric materials. The novelty of this
paper is the phonon crystal structure that has been proposed and the method to
study the effects of different dimensional parameters of the phonon crystal
structure on the bandgap magnitude.
  The phonon crystal bandgap is simulated by the COMSOL software and then
validated with other literature results. Based on the validated simulation
model, a regression parameter model is developed from the COMSOL software
simulation.
  The model is used to predict the magnitude of the bandgap of the phonon
crystal structure from input design parameters where the sensitivity of the
design parameters and their interactions can be analysed. The design parameters
can be optimized for the biggest bandgap magnitude based on the regression
parameter model. The optimization results show a significant improvement in the
magnitude of the bandgap.

  Uncertainty: A Kernel Embedding Approach",,,,,"cs.RO math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Many commodity sensors that measure the robot and dynamic obstacle's state
have non-Gaussian noise characteristics. Yet, many current approaches treat the
underlying-uncertainty in motion and perception as Gaussian, primarily to
ensure computational tractability. On the other hand, existing planners working
with non-Gaussian uncertainty do not shed light on leveraging distributional
characteristics of motion and perception noise, such as bias for efficient
collision avoidance.
  This paper fills this gap by interpreting reactive collision avoidance as a
distribution matching problem between the collision constraint violations and
Dirac Delta distribution. To ensure fast reactivity in the planner, we embed
each distribution in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space and reformulate the
distribution matching as minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between
the two distributions. We show that evaluating the MMD for a given control
input boils down to just matrix-matrix products. We leverage this insight to
develop a simple control sampling approach for reactive collision avoidance
with dynamic and uncertain obstacles.
  We advance the state-of-the-art in two respects. First, we conduct an
extensive empirical study to show that our planner can infer distributional
bias from sample-level information. Consequently, it uses this insight to guide
the robot to good homotopy. We also highlight how a Gaussian approximation of
the underlying uncertainty can lose the bias estimate and guide the robot to
unfavorable states with a high collision probability. Second, we show tangible
comparative advantages of the proposed distribution matching approach for
collision avoidance with previous non-parametric and Gaussian approximated
methods of reactive collision avoidance.

we collect a low-light HSI (LHSI) dataset of both indoor and outdoor scenes.
Based on Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction, we developed an
end-to-end data-driven low-light HSI enhancement (HSIE) approach trained on the
LHSI dataset. With the observation that illumination is related to the
low-frequency component of HSI, while textural details are closely correlated
to the high-frequency component, the proposed HSIE is designed to have two
branches. The illumination enhancement branch is adopted to enlighten the
low-frequency component with reduced resolution. The high-frequency refinement
branch is utilized for refining the high-frequency component via a predicted
mask. In addition, to improve information flow and boost performance, we
introduce an effective channel attention block (CAB) with residual dense

branch. The effectiveness and efficiency of HSIE both in quantitative
assessment measures and visual effects are demonstrated by experimental results
on the LHSI dataset. According to the classification performance on the remote

PdH is a long-standing challenge, because it depends on robust calculations of

scattering matrix element. To date, first-principles calculations employing
density functional theory (DFT) have been based on selected
exchange-correlation and core-electron approximations. Incorporating
anharmonicity produced a more realistic value of Tc that nevertheless still
disagreed strongly with experiment unless adjustable parameters were
introduced. Here we consider how the value of Tc predicted using DFT in the
harmonic approximation depends on the DFT scheme employed. The rationale for
this work is that unless the calculation of Tc within the harmonic
approximation is robust, albeit incorrect, there is not a solid foundation for
incorporating anharmonicity meaningfully. Six combinations of
exchange-correlation approximation (LDA, PBE, PBEsol) and core-electron
approximation (PAW, USPP) were tested. Following a carefully systematic
methodology, the calculated Tc was found to vary by a factor exceeding two
across the tested DFT schemes. This suggests strongly that ""standard"" DFT, even
including anharmonicity, is not reliable for PdH, implying that a higher-rung
method will be needed to calculate a realistic lattice constant and phonon band
structure, and so predict Tc accurately.

Normalization(GDN) has been widely used in image compression to rescale the
input features adaptively across both spatial and channel axes. However, the
representation power or degree of freedom of GDN is severely limited.
Additionally, GDN cannot consider the spatial correlation of an image. To
handle the limitations of GDN, we construct an expanded form of the adaptive
scaling module, named Expanded Adaptive Scaling Normalization(EASN). First, we
exploit the swish function to increase the representation ability. Then, we
increase the receptive field to make the adaptive rescaling module consider the

experimental constraints of very strong coupling and large measurement
bandwidths must be met simultaneously. We get around this problem using cQED
tools, and build a precisely characterized quantum simulator of the boundary
sine-Gordon model, a non-trivial bosonic impurity problem. We succeeded to
fully map out the finite frequency linear response of this system. Its reactive

agreement with non-perturbative calculations. Its dissipative part reveals a
dramatic many-body broadening caused by multi-photon conversion. The
experimental results are matched quantitatively to a resummed diagrammatic
calculation based on a microscopically calibrated model. Furthermore, we push
the device into a regime where diagrammatic calculations break down, which
calls for more advanced theoretical tools to model many-body quantum circuits.

  Recognition",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Named entity recognition (NER) task aims at identifying entities from a piece
of text that belong to predefined semantic types such as person, location,
organization, etc. The state-of-the-art solutions for flat entities NER
commonly suffer from capturing the fine-grained semantic information in
underlying texts. The existing span-based approaches overcome this limitation,
but the computation time is still a concern. In this work, we propose a novel
span-based NER framework, namely Global Pointer (GP), that leverages the
relative positions through a multiplicative attention mechanism. The ultimate
goal is to enable a global view that considers the beginning and the end
positions to predict the entity. To this end, we design two modules to identify
the head and the tail of a given entity to enable the inconsistency between the
training and inference processes. Moreover, we introduce a novel classification
loss function to address the imbalance label problem. In terms of parameters,
we introduce a simple but effective approximate method to reduce the training
parameters. We extensively evaluate GP on various benchmark datasets. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that GP can outperform the existing solution.
Moreover, the experimental results show the efficacy of the introduced loss
function compared to softmax and entropy alternatives.

  Communications","6pages, 3 figures, accepted by Globecom",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems, which can efficiently
utilize the congested spectrum and costly hardware resources by employing one
common waveform for both sensing and communication (S&C), have attracted
increasing attention. While the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) technique has been widely adopted to support high-quality
communications, it also has great potentials of improving radar sensing
performance and providing flexible S&C. In this paper, we propose to jointly
design the dual-functional transmit signals occupying several subcarriers to
realize multi-user OFDM communications and detect one moving target in the
presence of clutter. Meanwhile, the signals in other frequency subcarriers can
be optimized in a similar way to perform other tasks. The transmit beamforming
and receive filter are jointly optimized to maximize the radar output
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), while satisfying the
communication SINR requirement and the power budget. An majorization
minimization (MM) method based algorithm is developed to solve the resulting
non-convex optimization problem. Numerical results reveal the significant
wideband sensing gain brought by jointly designing the transmit signals in
different subcarriers, and demonstrate the advantages of our proposed scheme
and the effectiveness of the developed algorithm.

spatial-temporal dependencies. However, existing methods still suffer from two
critical limitations. Firstly, many approaches typically utilize static
pre-defined or adaptively learned spatial graphs to capture dynamic
spatial-temporal dependencies in the traffic system, which limits the
flexibility and only captures shared patterns for the whole time, thus leading
to sub-optimal performance. In addition, most approaches individually and
independently consider the absolute error between ground truth and predictions
at each time step, which fails to maintain the global properties and statistics
of time series as a whole and results in trend discrepancy between ground truth
and predictions. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic Adaptive and

Convolution Networks (GCNs) with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for
traffic forecasting. Specifically, DAAGCN leverages a universal paradigm with a
gate module to integrate time-varying embeddings with node embeddings to
generate dynamic adaptive graphs for inferring spatial-temporal dependencies at
each time step. Then, two discriminators are designed to maintain the
consistency of the global properties and statistics of predicted time series
with ground truth at the sequence and graph levels. Extensive experiments on

specification of a reference distribution with a desired tail behaviour, which
is in a one-to-one correspondence to a coherent upper probability. Any risk
measure, which is compatible with this upper probability, displays a tail
sensitivity which is finely tuned to the reference distribution. As a concrete
example, we focus on divergence risk measures based on f-divergence ambiguity
sets, which are a widespread tool used to foster distributional robustness of

highest accuracy to the best trade-off between simplicity of the expression and
sufficient accuracy for our intended use. The validity of simplifying

  Distillation Processes","11 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in advanced AI systems due to
their capability of representation learning on graph data. Even though GNN
explanation is crucial to increase user trust in the systems, it is challenging
due to the complexity of GNN execution. Lately, many works have been proposed
to address some of the issues in GNN explanation. However, they lack
generalization capability or suffer from computational burden when the size of
graphs is enormous. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-level GNN
explanation framework based on an observation that GNN is a multimodal learning
process of multiple components in graph data. The complexity of the original
problem is relaxed by breaking into multiple sub-parts represented as a
hierarchical structure. The top-level explanation aims at specifying the
contribution of each component to the model execution and predictions, while
fine-grained levels focus on feature attribution and graph structure
attribution analysis based on knowledge distillation. Student models are
trained in standalone modes and are responsible for capturing different teacher
behaviors, later used for particular component interpretation. Besides, we also
aim for personalized explanations as the framework can generate different
results based on user preferences. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness and fidelity of our proposed approach.

problems that depend on a single Lagrange multiplier are usually built under
nondegeneracy and strict complementarity. In this paper we establish a
condition of such type for two classes of nonlinear conic problems, namely
semidefinite and second-order cone programming, assuming Robinson's constraint
qualification and a weak constant rank-type property which are, together,
strictly weaker than nondegeneracy. Our approach is done via a penalty-based
strategy, which is aimed at providing strong global convergence results for
first- and second-order algorithms. Since we are not assuming strict
complementarity, the critical cone does not reduce to a subspace, thus, the
second-order condition we arrive at is defined in terms of the lineality space
of the critical cone. In the case of nonlinear programming, this condition
reduces to the standard second-order condition widely used as second-order
stationarity measure in the algorithmic practice.

quantified by the number of distinct sites that the random walk visits up to a

physical, chemical, and ecological phenomena. In spite of its fundamental
interest and wide utility, the number of visited sites gives only an incomplete
picture of this exploration. In this work, we introduce a more fundamental
quantity, the elapsed time $\tau_n$ between visits to the $n^{\rm th}$ and the
$(n+1)^{\rm st}$ distinct sites, from which the full dynamics about the
visitation statistics can be obtained. To determine the distribution of these
inter-visit times $\tau_n$, we develop a theoretical approach that relies on a
mapping with a trapping problem, in which, in contrast to previously studied
situations, the spatial distribution of traps is continuously updated by the
random walk itself. Despite the geometrical complexity of the territory
explored by a random walk (typically aspherical, as well as containing holes
and islands at all scales), we find that the distribution of the $\tau_n$ can
be accounted for by simple analytical expressions. Processes as varied as
regular diffusion, anomalous diffusion, and diffusion in disordered media and
fractals, fall into the same universality classes for the temporal history of
distinct sites visited. We confirm our theoretical predictions by Monte Carlo
and exact enumeration methods. We also determine additional basic exploration
observables, such as the perimeter of the visited domain or the number of
islands of unvisited sites enclosed within this domain, thereby illustrating
the generality of our approach. Because of their fundamental character and
their universality, these inter-visit times represent a promising tool to
unravel many more aspects of the exploration dynamics of random walks.

to investigate the performance of three different finite element method (FEM)

the presence of tissue conductivity anisotropy in the source space. In our
studies, the effect of anisotropy on the potential is related to model errors
when ignoring anisotropy and to numerical errors, convergence behavior and
computational speed of the different FEM approaches. Three different source
space anisotropy models that best represent adult, child and premature baby
volume conduction scenarios, are used. Major findings of the study include (1)
source space conductivity anisotropy has a significant effect on electric
potential computation: The effect increases with increasing anisotropy ratio;
(2) with numerical errors far below anisotropy effects, all three FEM
approaches are able to model source space anisotropy accordingly, with the
Venant approach offering the best compromise between accuracy and computational
speed; (3) FE meshes have to be fine enough in the subdomain between the source

technologies. In our previous research, we mathematically derived conflict-free
joint decision-making that optimally satisfies players' probabilistic
preference profiles. However, two problems exist regarding the optimal joint
decision-making method. First, as the number of choices increases, the
computational cost of calculating the optimal joint selection probability
matrix explodes. Second, to derive the optimal joint selection probability
matrix, all players must disclose their probabilistic preferences. Now, it is
noteworthy that explicit calculation of the joint probability distribution is
not necessarily needed; what is necessary for collective decisions is sampling.
This study examines several sampling methods that converge to heuristic joint
selection probability matrices that satisfy players' preferences. We show that
they can significantly reduce the above problems of computational cost and
confidentiality. We analyze the probability distribution each of the sampling
methods converges to, as well as the computational cost required and the
confidentiality secured. In particular, we introduce two conflict-free joint
sampling methods through quantum interference of photons. The first system
allows the players to hide their choices while satisfying the players'
preferences almost perfectly when they have the same preferences. The second
system, where the physical nature of light replaces the expensive computational
cost, also conceals their choices under the assumption that they have a trusted

sound and complete verification methods have been proposed towards that end,
but these typically suffer from severe scalability limitations. Recent work has
proposed enhancing such verification techniques with abstraction-refinement
capabilities, which have been shown to boost scalability: instead of verifying
a large and complex network, the verifier constructs and then verifies a much
smaller network, whose correctness implies the correctness of the original
network. A shortcoming of such a scheme is that if verifying the smaller
network fails, the verifier needs to perform a refinement step that increases
the size of the network being verified, and then start verifying the new
network from scratch - effectively ""wasting"" its earlier work on verifying the
smaller network. In this paper, we present an enhancement to abstraction-based
verification of neural networks, by using residual reasoning: the process of
utilizing information acquired when verifying an abstract network, in order to
expedite the verification of a refined network. In essence, the method allows
the verifier to store information about parts of the search space in which the
refined network is guaranteed to behave correctly, and allows it to focus on
areas where bugs might be discovered. We implemented our approach as an
extension to the Marabou verifier, and obtained promising results.

normal rule-based reasoning and typically semantic frameworks designed for
normal knowledge bases need substantial restructuring to support disjunctive
rules. Alternatively, one may lift characterizations of normal rules to support
disjunctive rules by inducing a collection of normal knowledge bases, each with
the same body and a single atom in its head. In this work, we refer to a set of
such normal knowledge bases as a head-cut of a disjunctive knowledge base. The
question arises as to whether the semantics of disjunctive hybrid MKNF
knowledge bases can be characterized using fixpoint constructions with
head-cuts. Earlier, we have shown that head-cuts can be paired with fixpoint
operators to capture the two-valued MKNF models of disjunctive hybrid MKNF
knowledge bases. Three-valued semantics extends two-valued semantics with the
ability to express partial information. In this work, we present a fixpoint
construction that leverages head-cuts using an operator that iteratively
captures three-valued models of hybrid MKNF knowledge bases with disjunctive
rules. This characterization also captures partial stable models of disjunctive
logic programs since a program can be expressed as a disjunctive hybrid MKNF
knowledge base with an empty ontology. We elaborate on a relationship between
this characterization and approximators in AFT (approximation fixpoint theory)

inference mechanisms. The datasets on which they are trained and evaluated can
be seen as database facts containing ground terms. This makes possible modeling
their inference mechanisms with equivalent logic programs, to better understand
not just how they propagate information between the entities involved in the
machine learning process but also to infer limits on what can be learned from a
given dataset and how well that might generalize to unseen test data.
  This leads us to the key idea of this paper: modeling with the help of a
logic program the information flows involved in learning to infer from the link
structure of a graph and the information content of its nodes properties of new
nodes, given their known connections to nodes with possibly similar properties.
The problem is known as graph node property prediction and our approach will
consist in emulating with help of a Prolog program the key information
propagation steps of a Graph Neural Network's training and inference stages.
  We test our a approach on the ogbn-arxiv node property inference benchmark.
To infer class labels for nodes representing papers in a citation network, we
distill the dependency trees of the text associated to each node into directed
acyclic graphs that we encode as ground Prolog terms. Together with the set of
their references to other papers, they become facts in a database on which we
reason with help of a Prolog program that mimics the information propagation in
graph neural networks predicting node properties. In the process, we invent
ground term similarity relations that help infer labels in the test set by
propagating node properties from similar nodes in the training set and we
evaluate their effectiveness in comparison with that of the graph's link
structure. Finally, we implement explanation generators that unveil performance
upper bounds inherent to the dataset.
  As a practical outcome, we obtain a logic program, that, when seen as machine
learning algorithm, performs close to the state of the art on the node property
prediction benchmark.

professional knowledge engineers are hard to find. One solution could be to
extract knowledge from English text, and a number of works have attempted to do
so (OpenSesame, Google's Sling, etc.). Unfortunately, at present, extraction of
logical facts from unrestricted natural language is still too inaccurate to be
used for reasoning, while restricting the grammar of the language (so-called
controlled natural language, or CNL) is hard for the users to learn and use.
Nevertheless, some recent CNL-based approaches, such as the Knowledge Authoring
Logic Machine (KALM), have shown to have very high accuracy compared to others,
and a natural question is to what extent the CNL restrictions can be lifted. In
this paper, we address this issue by transplanting the KALM framework to a
neural natural language parser, mStanza. Here we limit our attention to
authoring facts and queries and therefore our focus is what we call factual
English statements. Authoring other types of knowledge, such as rules, will be
considered in our followup work. As it turns out, neural network based parsers
have problems of their own and the mistakes they make range from part-of-speech
tagging to lemmatization to dependency errors. We present a number of
techniques for combating these problems and test the new system, KALMFL (i.e.,
KALM for factual language), on a number of benchmarks, which show KALMFL

we introduce a novel concept called Channel Lipschitz Constant (CLC), which is
defined as the Lipschitz constant of the mapping from the input images to the
output of each channel. Then we provide empirical evidences to show the strong
correlation between an Upper bound of the CLC (UCLC) and the trigger-activated
change on the channel activation. Since UCLC can be directly calculated from
the weight matrices, we can detect the potential backdoor channels in a
data-free manner, and do simple pruning on the infected DNN to repair the
model. The proposed Channel Lipschitzness based Pruning (CLP) method is super
fast, simple, data-free and robust to the choice of the pruning threshold.
Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficiency and
effectiveness of CLP, which achieves state-of-the-art results among the
mainstream defense methods even without any data. Source codes are available at

interpretability of the models is important. Shapley additive explanation
(SHAP) is one of the most promising interpretation methods for machine learning
models. Interaction effects occur when the effect of one variable depends on
the value of another variable. Even if each variable has little effect on the
outcome, its combination can have an unexpectedly large impact on the outcome.
Understanding interactions is important for understanding machine learning
models; however, naive SHAP analysis cannot distinguish between the main effect
and interaction effects. In this paper, we introduce the Shapley-Taylor index
as an interpretation method for machine learning models using SHAP considering
interaction effects. We apply the method to the cancer cohort data of Kyushu

computing. Therefore, quantum systems candidates for quantum computation must
be able to interact all their constituent qubits. Here, we model the quantum
dot spin qubits by a spin chain with nearest-neighbors interaction. Within this
model, we can perform the interaction of distant qubits by the action of
consecutive SWAP gates. The SWAP gate exchange the information of two different
qubits and it is obtained by a time-dependent interaction of nearest-neighbors
qubits that is switched on and off as the quantum information is propagated
through the system. By using this scheme, we also are able to implement the
CNOT gate, which is a fundamental gate to obtain universal quantum computation.
These gates are probed in a system free from decoherence, which provides a very
efficient connection between distant qubits. Furthermore, we analyze the
situation when the dissipation is present. To perform such a task, we consider
dephasing and amplitude-damping types of errors in each site of the spin chain.
We found that the order of the SWAP and CNOT gates is important and it can lead
to a relevant difference in fidelity when the number of qubits is large.

emission is weakly variable over the pulsar phase while the direct emission
shows significantly larger pulsation amplitude. We propose that in this system
the neutron star finds itself in the centre of the well formed by the inner
edge of the geometrically thick super-Eddington accretion disc truncated by the
magnetic field of the pulsar. The aspect ratio of the well is H/R \sim 1. The
inner edge of the truncated disc is continuously illuminated by the emission of
the accretion column giving rise to the weakly variable reflected emission. As
the neutron star rotates, its emission sweeps through the line of sight, giving
rise to the pulsating direct emission. From Doppler broadening of the iron
line, we measure the truncation radius of the accretion disc \sim 50 R_g. The
inferred dipole component of the magnetic field is consistent with previous
estimates favouring a not very strong field. The uniqueness of this system is
determined by its moderately super-Eddington accretion rate and the moderate
magnetic field so that the inner edge of the truncated geometrically thick

optimal use of TFD/ combined TFDs as input for CNNs. The presented results
revealed that: 1) The transformation of the heart sound signal into the TF
domain achieves higher classification performance than using of raw signals.
Among the TFDs, the difference in the performance was slight for all the CNN
models (within $1.3\%$ in average accuracy). However, Continuous wavelet

appropriate increase of the CNN capacity and architecture optimisation can
improve the performance, while the network architecture should not be overly

the number of parameters and the depth of the structure do not improve the
performance apparently. 3) Combining TFDs as CNN inputs did not significantly
improve the classification results. The findings of this study provided the

evolution of the internal rotation of stars, and to identify at which stage the
rotation of the contracting cores of evolved stars decouples from their
expanding envelopes. The donor stars of mass transferring binaries lose almost
their entire envelope and may thus offer a direct view on their core rotation.
After the mass transfer event they contract and fade rapidly, although they are
well observable when caught in the short-lived B-star phase. The B-type primary
of the galactic binary system LB-1, which was originally suggested to contain a
massive black hole, is nicely explained as a stripped star accompanied by a
fainter Be star. The narrow absorption lines in the primary's spectrum signify
extremely slow rotation, atypical of B-type main-sequence stars. Here we
investigate the evolution of mass donors in generic grids of detailed binary
evolution models, where both stars include differential rotation, internal
angular momentum transport, and spin-orbit coupling. Whereas the mass gainers
are typically spun-up during the mass transfer, we find that the spins of the
stripped donor models depend sensitively on the employed mechanism for internal
angular momentum transport. Purely hydrodynamic transport cannot explain the
observed slow rotation, while models including magnetic angular momentum
transport are able to reproduce the observed rotation of LB-1 and similar
stars, independent of the initial rotation rate. In such models the spin of the
white dwarfs that emerge at the end of the evolution is independent of the mass
stripping. We find evidence that the mass transfer in LB-1 was moderately
non-conservative.

virtual domain. The central idea is to cast the simulation into an
image-to-image translation problem. We train our pix2pix based architecture on
two real world data sets, namely the popular KITTI data set and the Audi
Autonomous Driving Dataset which provide both, RGB and LiDAR images. We apply
this network on synthetic renderings and show that it generalizes sufficiently
from real images to simulated images. This strategy enables to skip the
sensor-specific, expensive and complex LiDAR physics simulation in our
synthetic world and avoids oversimplification and a large domain-gap through
the clean synthetic environment.

as BLEU to approximate the results of human judgement. These metrics originate
from the machine translation domain and it is unclear whether they are
applicable for the code generation tasks and how well they agree with the human
evaluation on this task. There are also other metrics, CodeBLEU and RUBY,
developed to estimate the similarity of code, that take into account the
properties of source code. However, for these metrics there are hardly any
studies on their agreement with the human evaluation. Despite all that, minimal
differences in the metric scores have been used in recent papers to claim
superiority of some code generation models over the others.
  In this paper, we present a study on the applicability of six metrics --
BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR, ChrF, CodeBLEU, and RUBY -- for evaluation of code
generation models. We conduct a study on two different code generation datasets
and use human annotators to assess the quality of all models run on these

one-liners, none of the metrics can correctly emulate human judgement on which
model is better with >95% certainty if the difference in model scores is less
than 5 points. For the HearthStone dataset, which consists of classes of a
particular structure, a difference in model scores of at least 2 points is
enough to claim the superiority of one model over the other. Our findings
suggest that the ChrF metric is a better fit for the evaluation of code

length $\beta < 0.001 /\overset{\circ}{\mathrm{A}}$) with high conductance
($\sim 0.1$ G$_0$) at low voltages (50 meV) over long distances ($z > 10$ nm).
The transport behavior is sensitive to the coupling between ribbon and

acknowledged as an effective transmission route of respiratory diseases, as
exemplified by COVID-19. In order to assess the risks associated with this
pathway in daily-life settings involving tens to hundreds of individuals, the
chasm needs to be bridged between fluid dynamical simulations of droplet
propagation and population-scale epidemiological models. We achieve this by
coarse-graining microscopic droplet trajectories (simulated in various ambient
flows) into spatio-temporal maps of viral concentration around the emitter and
coupling these maps to field-data about pedestrian crowds in different
scenarios (streets, train stations, markets, queues, and street caf{\'e}s). At
the scale of an individual pedestrian, our results highlight the paramount
importance of the velocity of the ambient air flow relative to the emitter's
motion. This aerodynamic effect, which disperses infectious aerosols and thus
mitigates short-range transmission risks, prevails over all other environmental
variables. At the crowd's scale, the method yields a ranking of the scenarios
by the risks of new infections that they present, dominated by the street
caf{\'e}s and then the outdoor market. While the effect of light winds on the
qualitative ranking is fairly marginal, even the most modest ambient air flows
dramatically lower the quantitative rates of new infections. The proposed
framework was here applied with SARS-CoV-2 in mind, but its generalization to
other airborne pathogens and to other (real or hypothetical) crowd arrangements
is straightforward.

magnetic order down to 0.05~K in $x = 0.1$ single crystals. The weak
temperature-dependent plateaus of the dynamic spin fluctuations below 0.2~K in
ZF-$\mu$SR together with its longitudinal-field (LF) dependence between 0 and
3~kG indicate the presence of dynamic spin fluctuations persisting even at $T$

increases as --log $T$ on cooling below 0.9~K, passes through a broad maximum
at 0.13~K and slightly decreases on further cooling. The ac-susceptibility also
exhibits a frequency independent broad peak at 0.16~K, which is prominent with
an applied field $H$ along $c$-direction. We, therefore, argue that such a
behavior for $x=0.1$ (namely, a plateau in spin relaxation rate ($\lambda$)
below 0.2~K and a linear $T$ dependence in $C_{\text{4f}}$ below 0.13~K) can be
attributed to a metallic spin-liquid (SL) ground state near the quantum
critical point in the frustrated Kondo lattice. The LF-$\mu$SR study suggests
that the out of kagome plane spin fluctuations are responsible for the SL
behavior. Low energy inelastic neutron scattering (INS) of $x$ = 0.1 reveals
gapless magnetic excitations, which are also supported by the behavior of
$C_{\text{4f}}$ proportional to $T^{1.1}$ down to 0.06~K.

short-ranged molecular interactions between curved slender fibers undergoing
large 3D deformations, and gives a detailed overview how it fits into the
framework of existing fiber or beam interaction models, either considering
microscale molecular or macroscale contact effects. The direct evaluation of a
molecular interaction potential between two general bodies in 3D space would
require to integrate molecule densities over two 3D volumes, leading to a
sixfold integral to be solved numerically. By exploiting the short-range nature
of the considered class of interaction potentials as well as the fundamental
kinematic assumption of undeformable fiber cross-sections, as typically applied
in mechanical beam theories, a recently derived, closed-form analytical
solution is applied for the interaction potential between a given section of
the first fiber (slave beam) and the entire second fiber (master beam). This
novel approach based on a pre-defined section-beam interaction potential (SBIP)
requires only one single integration step along the slave beam length to be
performed numerically. In terms of accuracy, the total beam-beam interaction
potential resulting from this approach is shown to exhibit an asymptotically
consistent angular and distance scaling behavior. In addition to elementary
two-fiber systems, carefully chosen to verify accuracy and asymptotic
consistence of the proposed SBIP approach, a potential practical application in
form of adhesive nanofiber-grafted surfaces is studied. Involving a large
number of helicoidal fibers undergoing large 3D deformations, arbitrary mutual
fiber orientations as well as frequent local fiber pull-off and
snap-into-contact events, this example demonstrates the robustness and
computational efficiency of the new approach.

foremost importance for evolutive biology since it enables us to understand
life as we know it. Preliminary results, based on the upper bound protein
marginal-stability limit, together with transition state theory arguments, lead
us to show that two-state proteins must reach their native state in, at most,
seconds rather than ($\sim 10^{27}$) years -- as indicated by a naive solution
of the Levinthal paradox. This outcome -- added to the amide hydrogen-exchange
protection factors analysis -- makes it possible for us to suggest how a
protein point mutations and/or post-translational modifications impact its
folding time scales but not its upper bound limit that obeys the physics ruling
the process. Noteworthy for almost 50 years, the protein folding problem --mas
the Levinthal paradox -- has been a topic of passionate debate because
Anfinsen's challenge -- how a sequence encodes its folding -- remains unsolved

tridimensional structures by state-of-the-art numerical-methods. Aimed to
unlock this long-standing challenge, we propose a new perspective of protein
folding, specifically, as a problem that should be devised as an 'analytic
whole' -- a Leibniz & Kant's notion. This viewpoint might help us decode
Anfinsen's challenge and, thus, open new avenues for future research in the

with the SM via gravity in a five-dimensional model we find that a large range
of dark matter and Kaluza-Klein graviton masses can lead to the observed relic
density. The preferred values of the masses and the strength of the interaction
make this scenario very hard to test in terrestrial experiments. However,
significant parts of the parameter space lead to warm dark matter and can be
tested by cosmological and astrophysical observations.

are functions of both the underlying pathogen as well as human or animal
behavior. This challenge is increased when modeling how diseases spread between
different spatial locations. Many proposed spatial epidemiological models
require trade-offs to fit, either by abstracting away theoretical spread
dynamics, fitting a deterministic model, or by requiring large computational
resources for many simulations. We propose an approach that approximates the
complex spatial spread dynamics with a Gaussian process. We first propose a
flexible spatial extension to the well-known SIR stochastic process, and then
we derive a moment-closure approximation to this stochastic process. This
moment-closure approximation yields ordinary differential equations for the
evolution of the means and covariances of the susceptibles and infectious
through time. Because these ODEs are a bottleneck to fitting our model by MCMC,
we approximate them using a low-rank emulator. This approximation serves as the
basis for our hierarchical model for noisy, underreported counts of new
infections by spatial location and time. We demonstrate using our model to
conduct inference on simulated infections from the underlying, true spatial SIR
jump process. We then apply our method to model counts of new Zika infections
in Brazil from late 2015 through early 2016.

small input changes. One popular way to achieve this property is by designing
networks with a small Lipschitz constant. In this work, we propose a new
technique for constructing such Lipschitz networks that has a number of
desirable properties: it can be applied to any linear network layer
(fully-connected or convolutional), it provides formal guarantees on the
Lipschitz constant, it is easy to implement and efficient to run, and it can be
combined with any training objective and optimization method. In fact, our
technique is the first one in the literature that achieves all of these
properties simultaneously. Our main contribution is a rescaling-based weight
matrix parametrization that guarantees each network layer to have a Lipschitz
constant of at most 1 and results in the learned weight matrices to be close to
orthogonal. Hence we call such layers almost-orthogonal Lipschitz (AOL).
Experiments and ablation studies in the context of image classification with
certified robust accuracy confirm that AOL layers achieve results that are on
par with most existing methods. Yet, they are simpler to implement and more
broadly applicable, because they do not require computationally expensive
matrix orthogonalization or inversion steps as part of the network
architecture. We provide code at https://github.com/berndprach/AOL.

that current state-of-the-art DL-based reconstruction algorithms are indeed
sensitive to such perturbations to a degree where relevant diagnostic

spatial distributions of intensities at 350~$\mu$m. A decrease in dust

star. The amplitude of the asymptotic scattered wave, considered here at linear
order in Newton's constant $G$ while at higher orders in the object's multipole
expansion, is a valuable characterization of the response of the object to
external gravitational fields. This amplitude coincides with a classical
($\hbar\to0$) limit of a quantum 4-point (object and graviton in, object and

generalized-unitary-based approaches to the post-Minkowskian dynamics of

techniques. Our analysis encompasses both empty-core and filled-core vortices.
In the latter case, the vortex acquires a mass due to the presence of
distinguishable atoms located in its core. The axisymmetry allows us to reduce
the coupled dynamical equations of motion to a single radial equation with an
effective potential $V_{\rm eff}$. In many cases, $V_{\rm eff}$ has a single
minimum, where the vortex precesses uniformly. The dynamics of the vortex and
the localized massive core arises from the dependence of the energy on the
radial position of the vortex and from the $r^k$ trap potential. We find that a
positive vortex with small mass orbits in the positive direction, but the sense
of precession can reverse as the core mass increases. Early experiments and

domains, their authoring still remains a tedious and complex process. Current
tools offer considerable support for creating individual visualizations but
provide limited support for discovering groups of visualizations that can be
collectively useful for composing analytic dashboards. To address this problem,
we present MEDLEY, a mixed-initiative interface that assists in dashboard
composition by recommending dashboard collections (i.e., a logically grouped
set of views and filtering widgets) that map to specific analytical intents.
Users can specify dashboard intents (namely, measure analysis, change analysis,
category analysis, or distribution analysis) explicitly through an input panel
in the interface or implicitly by selecting data attributes and views of
interest. The system recommends collections based on these analytic intents,
and views and widgets can be selected to compose a variety of dashboards.
MEDLEY also provides a lightweight direct manipulation interface to configure
interactions between views in a dashboard. Based on a study with 13
participants performing both targeted and open-ended tasks, we discuss how
MEDLEY's recommendations guide dashboard composition and facilitate different
user workflows. Observations from the study identify potential directions for
future work, including combining manual view specification with dashboard
recommendations and designing natural language interfaces for dashboard
authoring.

processes such as froth flotation. Despite their importance, details of the
collision process have not received much attention yet. This is compounded by
the sometimes counter-intuitive behaviour of bubbles and particles in
turbulence, as exemplified by the fact that they segregate in space. Although
bubble-particle relative behaviour is fundamentally different from that of
identical particles, the existing theoretical models are nearly all extensions
of theories for particle-particle collisions in turbulence. The adequacy of
these theories has yet to be assessed as appropriate data remain scarce to
date. In this investigation, we study the geometric collision rate by means of
direct numerical simulations of bubble-particle collisions in homogeneous
isotropic turbulence using the point-particle approach over a range of the
relevant parameters, including the Stokes and Reynolds numbers. We analyse the
spatial distribution of bubble and particles, and quantify to what extent their
segregation reduces the collision rate. This effect is countered by increased
approach velocities for bubble-particle compared to monodisperse pairs, which
we relate to the difference in how bubbles and particles respond to fluid
accelerations. We found that in the investigated parameter range, these
collision statistics are not altered significantly by the inclusion of a lift
force or different drag parametrisations, or when assuming infinite particle
density. Furthermore, we critically examine existing models and discuss
inconsistencies therein that contribute to the discrepancy.

used in quantum sensing. Atom-atom interaction can be used to generate
entanglement for achieving quantum enhanced sensing. However, atom-atom
interaction always induces collision shift, which brings systematic error in
determining the resonance frequency. Contradiction between utilizing atom-atom
interaction and suppressing collision shift generally exists in atomic
spectroscopy. Here, we propose an antisymmetric Rabi spectroscopy protocol
without collision shift in the presence of atom-atom interactions. We
analytically find that the antisymmetric point can be used for determining the
resonance frequency. For small Rabi frequency, our antisymmetric Rabi
spectroscopy with slight atom-atom interaction can provide better measurement
precision than the conventional Rabi spectroscopy. With stronger atom-atom
interaction and Rabi frequency, the spectrum resolution can be dramatically
improved and the measurement precision may even beat the standard quantum
limit. Moreover, unlike the quantum-enhanced Ramsey interferometry via spin
squeezing, our scheme is robust against detection noises. Our antisymmetric
Rabi spectroscopy protocol has promising applications in various practical
quantum sensors such as atomic clocks and atomic magnetometers.

electrochemical systems such as lithium ion batteries. Nonetheless, the
mechanism of transport amid strong ion-ion interactions remains enigmatic. A
key question is whether the dynamics of ion transport can be predicted by the
local static structure alone, and if so what are the key structural motifs that
determine transport. In this paper, we show that machine learning can
successfully decompose global conductivity into the spatio-temporal average of
local, instantaneous ionic contributions, and relate this ``local molar
conductivity"" field to the local ionic environment. Our machine learning model
accurately predicts the molar conductivity of electrolyte systems that were not
part of the training set, suggesting that the dynamics of ion transport is
predictable from local static structure. Further, through analysing this
machine-learned local conductivity field, we observe that fluctuations in local
conductivity at high concentration are negatively correlated with total molar
conductivity. Surprisingly, these fluctuations arise due to a long tail
distribution of low conductivity ions, rather than distinct ion pairs, and are
spatially correlated through both like- and unlike-charge interactions. More
broadly, our approach shows how machine learning can aid the understanding of
complex soft matter systems, by learning a function that attributes global
collective properties to local, atomistic contributions.

applications, such as the Vision Processing Unit (VPU) for image recognition,
further increases developers' configuration, development, and management
overhead. Developers have successfully used fully automated elastic cloud
services such as serverless computing to counter these additional efforts and
shorten development cycles for applications running on CPUs. Unfortunately,
current cloud solutions do not yet provide these simplifications for
applications that require hardware acceleration. However, as the development of
specialized hardware acceleration continues to provide performance and cost
improvements, it will become increasingly important to enable ease of use in
the cloud.
  In this paper, we present an initial design and implementation of Hardless,
an extensible and generalized serverless computing architecture that can
support workloads for arbitrary hardware accelerators. We show how Hardless can
scale across different commodity hardware accelerators and support a variety of
workloads using the same execution and programming model common in serverless
computing today.

developing very successful wave theories for nonlinear free-surface flows,
under the assumption of irrotationality. This success, in conjunction with the
recognition that almost all flows in the sea are not irrotational, raises the
question of extending Hamilton Principle to rotational free-surface flows. The
equations governing the fluid motion within the fluid domain, in the Eulerian
description, have been derived by means of Hamilton Principle since late 50s.
Nevertheless, a complete variational formulation of the problem, including the
derivation of boundary conditions, seems to be lacking up to now. Such a
formulation is given in the present work. The differential equations governing
the fluid motion are derived as usually, starting from the typical Lagrangian,
constrained with the conservation of mass and the conservation of fluid parcels
identity. To obtain the boundary conditions, generic differential-variational
constraints are introduced in the boundary variational equation, leading to a
reformulation which permits us to derive both kinematic and dynamic conditions
on all boundaries of the fluid, including the free surface. An interesting
feature, appearing in the present variational derivation of kinematic boundary
conditions, is a dual possibility of obtaining either the usual kinematic
condition (the same as in irrotational flow) or a condition of different type,
corresponding to zero tangential velocity on the boundary. The deeper meaning
and the significance of these findings seem to deserve further analysis.

stars. The galactic source G079.1272+02.2782 (G79), a MYSO at about 1.4 kpc, is
an ideal source to carry out this kind of studies. Near-IR integral field
spectroscopic observations were carried out using NIFS at Gemini-North. The
spectral and angular resolutions, allow us to perform a detailed study of the
source and its southern jet, resolving structures with sizes between 200 and
300 au. As a complement, millimeter data retrieved from the JCMT and the IRAM
30m telescope databases were analyzed to study the molecular gas at a larger
spatial scale. The analysis of a jet extending southwards shows cork-screw like
structures at 2.2 um continuum, strongly suggesting that the jet is precessing.
The jet velocity is estimated in 30-43 km/s and it is coming to us along the
line of sight. We suggest that the precession may be produced by the
gravitational tidal effects generated in a probable binary system, and we
estimate a jet precession period of about 10^3 yr, indicating a slow-precessing
jet, which is in agreement with the observed helical features. An analysis of
H2 lines along the jet allows us to investigate in detail a bow-shock produced
by this jet. We find that this bow-shock is indeed generated by a C-type shock
and it is observed coming to us, with some inclination angle, along the line of
sight. This is confirmed by the analysis of molecular outflows at a larger
spatial scale. A brief analysis of several molecular species at millimeter
wavelengths indicates a complex chemistry developing at the external layers of
the molecular clump in which MYSO G79 is embedded.

the electron neutrino flavor. Motivated by the EMPRESS results, we present a
comprehensive analysis of the lepton asymmetry using measurements of the

find an electron neutrino chemical potential $\xi_{\nu_e} = 0.043 \pm 0.015$,

reaction rates. If the true helium abundance corresponds to the EMPRESS central
value, future CMB observations from the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 will
increase the significance for a nonzero lepton asymmetry to $4\sigma$ and

possible advantages related to the lack of definite causal order of quantum

whether indefinite causal order is a resource for quantum thermodynamics.
Inspired by previous results in the literature, we show that indefinite causal
order is not necessary for the reported increase in free energy and ergotropy.
More specifically, we show that a simple causally ordered process, which
replaces the system's state with a new one before the final measurement,
outperforms the quantum switch in all thermodynamic tasks considered so far. We
further show that a similar advantage can be also achieved without completely
discarding system, if we allow for non-Markovian interactions between the
system and an environment. We extend the analysis to more extreme examples of
indefinite causal order, showing that they do not provide an advantage either.
Finally, we discuss a possible way to study the advantages that may arise from
indefinite causal order in a general scenario.

Neighborhood Collective Noise Verification to separate all training samples

risk of individuals is time-independent, such as the proportional hazards
model. There are several suggestions, but no consensus, on how it could be
extended to models where risk varies over time, e.g.\ in case of crossing
hazard rates. We show that, in the limit, concordance is maximized if and only
if the risk score is concordant with the hazard rate, in the sense that for a
comparable pair where the first event time is observed, the risk score is
concordant with the hazard rate at this first event time. Thus, we suggest
using the hazard rate as the risk score when calculating concordance. Through
simulations, we demonstrate situations in which other concordance indices can
lead to incorrect models being selected over a true model, justifying the use
of our suggested risk prediction in both model selection and in loss functions
in, e.g., machine learning models.

and these rogue patterns are described by root structures of Okamoto polynomial
hierarchies. These rogue patterns arise when the $\tau$ functions of rogue wave
solutions are determinants of Schur polynomials with index jumps of three, and
an internal free parameter in these rogue waves gets large. We demonstrate
these new rogue patterns in the Manakov system and the three-wave resonant
interaction system. For each system, we derive asymptotic predictions of its
rogue patterns under a large internal parameter through Okamoto polynomial
hierarchies. Unlike the previously reported rogue patterns associated with the
Yablonskii-Vorob'ev hierarchy, a new feature in the present rogue patterns is
that, the mapping from the root structure of Okamoto-hierarchy polynomials to
the shape of the rogue pattern is linear only to the leading order, but becomes
nonlinear to the next order. As a consequence, the current rogue patterns are
often deformed, sometimes strongly deformed, from Okamoto root structures,
unless the underlying free parameter is very large. Our analytical predictions
of rogue patterns are compared to true solutions, and excellent agreement is
observed, even when rogue patterns are strongly deformed from Okamoto root
structures.

multiple scenarios in which standard methods of inference will lead to
misleading conclusions; corrupted data, models which are only representative of
subsets of the data, or multiple regions in which the model is best fit using
different parameters. Methods exist for the exclusion of some anomalous types
of data, but in practice, data cleaning is often undertaken by hand before
attempting to fit models to data. In this work, we will introduce the concept
of Bayesian data selection; the simultaneous inference of both model
parameters, and parameters which represent our belief that each observation
within the data should be included in the inference. The aim, within a Bayesian
setting, is to find the regions of observation space for which the model can
well-represent the data, and to find the corresponding model parameters for
those regions. A number of approaches will be explored, and applied to test
problems in linear regression, and to the problem of fitting an ODE model,
approximated by a finite difference method, to data. The approaches are
extremely simple to implement, can aid mixing of Markov chains designed to
sample from the arising densities, and are very broadly applicable to the
majority of inferential problems. As such this approach has the potential to
change the way that we conduct and interpret the fitting of models to data.

hemisphere of solar cycle 24. After emergence, the magnetic polarities separate
each other without building a sheared polarity inversion line. In all four ARs,
the magnetic fields are driven by foot point motions such that the sign of the
helicity injection ($dH/dt$) in the first half of the evolution is changed to
the opposite sign in the later part of the observation time. This successive
injection of opposite helicity is also consistent with the sign of mean
force-free twist parameter ($\alpha_{av}$). Further, the EUV light curves of
the ARs in 94\AA~and GOES X-ray flux reveal flaring activity below C-class
magnitude. Importantly, the white-light coronagraph images in conjunction with
the AR images in AIA 94 \AA~delineate the absence of associated CMEs with the

formation with excess coronal helicity, and therefore are unable to launch

gaining direct access to their charge carrier properties via magnetic quantum
oscillations. We trace the evolution of the effective cyclotron mass as the
conduction bandwidth is tuned very close to the MIT by means of precisely
controlled external pressure. We find that the sensitivity of the mass
renormalization to tiny changes of the bandwidth is significantly stronger than
theoretically predicted and is even further enhanced upon entering the
transition region where the metallic and insulating phases coexist. On the

preserves a large coherent Fermi surface with no significant enhancement of

to study the breakdown of localisation. This opens up the possibility to
controllably increase the density of thermal regions and examine the breakdown
of localisation as this density is increased. At strong disorder, the numerical
results are consistent with commonly-used diagnostics for localisation even
when the concentration of thermalising regions is high. At moderate disorder, I
present evidence for slow dynamics and sub-diffusive transport across a large
region of the phase diagram, suggestive of a `bad metal' phase. This suggests
that dilute disorder may be a useful effective model for studying Griffiths
effects in many-body localisation, and perhaps also in a wider class of
disordered systems.

systems. These event data can be analyzed through process mining techniques.
For traditional process mining techniques, one has to associate each event with
exactly one object, e.g., the company's customer. Events related to one object
form an event sequence called a case. A case describes an end-to-end run
through a process. The cases contained in event data can be used to discover a
process model, detect frequent bottlenecks, or learn predictive models.
However, events encountered in real-life information systems, e.g., ERP
systems, can often be associated with multiple objects. The traditional
sequential case concept falls short of these object-centric event data as these
data exhibit a graph structure. One might force object-centric event data into
the traditional case concept by flattening it. However, flattening manipulates
the data and removes information. Therefore, a concept analogous to the case
concept of traditional event logs is necessary to enable the application of
different process mining tasks on object-centric event data. In this paper, we
introduce the case concept for object-centric process mining: process
executions. These are graph-based generalizations of cases as considered in
traditional process mining. Furthermore, we provide techniques to extract
process executions. Based on these executions, we determine equivalent process
behavior with respect to an attribute using graph isomorphism. Equivalent
process executions with respect to the event's activity are object-centric
variants, i.e., a generalization of variants in traditional process mining. We
provide a visualization technique for object-centric variants. The
contribution's scalability and efficiency are extensively evaluated.
Furthermore, we provide a case study showing the most frequent object-centric
variants of a real-life event log.

of the structure of the operator system dual of the operator system

determining precisely the structure of the generators of the extremal rays of
the positive cones of the operator systems $C(S^1)^{(n)}\omin\B(\H)$ and
$C(S^1)_{(n)}\omin\B(\H)$, where $\H$ is an arbitrary Hilbert space and
$C(S^1)_{(n)}$ is the operator system dual of $C(S^1)^{(n)}$. Our approach also
has the advantage of providing some new information concerning positive
Toeplitz matrices whose entries are from $\B(\H)$ when $\H$ has infinite

$\B(\H)$ are partially completely positive in the sense that $\psi^{(n)}(x)$ is

from $\B(\H)$. We also establish a certain factorisation theorem for positive
Toeplitz matrices (of operators), showing an equivalence between the Gurvits
approach to separation and an earlier approach of T.~Ando to universality.

utilization of more coordinating anions such as

Li$^+$ solvation to accelerate the Li$^+$ transport and reach higher Li$^+$

the Li$^+$ transport (increased Li$^+$ transference number by 600$\%$ and
Li$^+$ conductivity by 200-300$\%$) and computer simulations reveal that
lithium dynamics are effectively re-coupled from polymer to anion dynamics.
Finally, this concept of coordinating anions in TSPEs was successfully applied

function approximation and off-policy sampling. Since it is well-known that in
this setting TD-learning can be unstable, we propose a stable generic algorithm
(including two specific algorithms: the $\lambda$-averaged $Q$-trace and the
two-sided $Q$-trace) that uses multi-step return and generalized importance
sampling factors, and provide the finite-sample analysis. Combining the
geometric convergence of the actor with the finite-sample analysis of the

properties of the water, such as turbidity and light attenuation. These
phenomena cause color distortion, blurring, and contrast reduction. In
addition, irregular ambient light distribution causes color channel unbalance
and regions with high-intensity pixels. Recent works related to underwater
image enhancement, and based on deep learning approaches, tackle the lack of
paired datasets generating synthetic ground-truth. In this paper, we present a
self-supervised learning methodology for underwater image enhancement based on
deep learning that requires no paired datasets. The proposed method estimates
the degradation present in underwater images. Besides, an autoencoder
reconstructs this image, and its output image is degraded using the estimated
degradation information. Therefore, the strategy replaces the output image with
the degraded version in the loss function during the training phase. This
procedure \textit{misleads} the neural network that learns to compensate the
additional degradation. As a result, the reconstructed image is an enhanced
version of the input image. Also, the algorithm presents an attention module to
reduce high-intensity areas generated in enhanced images by color channel
unbalances and outlier regions. Furthermore, the proposed methodology requires
no ground-truth. Besides, only real underwater images were used to train the
neural network, and the results indicate the effectiveness of the method in
terms of color preservation, color cast reduction, and contrast improvement.

describe the sensitivity of an ad hoc measurement that used one or more freely
moving radiation detector systems would be significantly beneficial for the
conduct and understanding of many radiological search activities. In a
real-time scenario with a free-moving detector system, an MDA map can provide
useful feedback to the operator about which areas have not been searched as
thoroughly as others, thereby allowing the operator to prioritize future
actions. Similarly, such a calculation could be used to inform subsequent
navigation decisions of autonomous platforms. Here we describe a near real-time
MDA mapping approach that can be applied when searching for point sources using
detected events in a spectral region of interest while assuming a constant,
unknown background rate. We show the application of this MDA mapping method to
a real scenario, a survey of the interior of a small building using a handheld
detector system. Repeated measurements with no sources and with Cs-137 sources
of different strengths yield results consistent with the estimated thresholds
and MDA values; namely, that for background-only measurements no sources are
seen above threshold anywhere in the scene, while when sources are present they
are detected above the thresholds calculated for their locations.

canonical PDEs have been discovered successfully for proof-of-concept. However,
determining the most proper PDE without prior references remains challenging in
terms of practical applications. In this work, a physics-informed information
criterion (PIC) is proposed to measure the parsimony and precision of the
discovered PDE synthetically. The proposed PIC achieves state-of-the-art
robustness to highly noisy and sparse data on seven canonical PDEs from
different physical scenes, which confirms its ability to handle difficult
situations. The PIC is also employed to discover unrevealed macroscale
governing equations from microscopic simulation data in an actual physical
scene. The results show that the discovered macroscale PDE is precise and
parsimonious, and satisfies underlying symmetries, which facilitates
understanding and simulation of the physical process. The proposition of PIC
enables practical applications of PDE discovery in discovering unrevealed

demonstrated. The presence of cut-offs in the gamma-ray spectra of several
young SNRs led to the idea that PeV energies might only be achieved during the
first years of a remnant's evolution. We use our time-dependent
acceleration-code RATPaC to study the acceleration of cosmic-rays in supernovae
expanding into dense environments around massive stars. We performed
spherically symmetric 1-D simulations in which we simultaneously solve the
transport equations for cosmic-rays, magnetic turbulence, and the
hydrodynamical flow of the thermal plasma in the test-particle limit. We
investigated typical CSM parameters expected around RSG and LBV stars for
freely expanding winds and accounted for the strong gamma-gamma-absorption in
the first days after explosion. The maximum achievable particle energy is
limited to below 600TeV even for largest considered values of the magnetic
field and mass-loss rates. The maximum energy is not expected to surpass 200TeV
and 70TeV for LBVs and RSGs that experience moderate mass-loss prior to the
explosion. We find gamma-ray peak-luminosities consistent with current upper
limits and evaluated that current-generation instruments are able to detect the
gamma-rays from Type-IIP explosions at distances up to 60kpc and Type-IIn
explosions up to 1.0Mpc. We also find a good agreement between the thermal

memory cost of training deep neural networks~(DNNs). However, state-of-the-art
work combines a search of quantization bit-width with the training, which makes
the procedure complicated and less transparent. To this end, we propose a
simple and effective method to compress DNN training. Our method is motivated
by an instructive observation: DNN backward propagation mainly utilizes the
low-frequency component (LFC) of the activation maps, while the majority of
memory is for caching the high-frequency component (HFC) during the training.
This indicates the HFC of activation maps is highly redundant and compressible
during DNN training, which inspires our proposed Dual Activation Precision
(DIVISION). During the training, DIVISION preserves the high-precision copy of
LFC and compresses the HFC into a light-weight copy with low numerical
precision. This can significantly reduce the memory cost without negatively
affecting the precision of backward propagation such that DIVISION maintains
competitive model accuracy. Experiment results show DIVISION has better
comprehensive performance than state-of-the-art methods, including over 10x
compression of activation maps and competitive training throughput, without
loss of model accuracy.

states are severely lacking. In this paper, we explore the potential advantages
of performing non-Gaussian operations on TMST state for phase estimation using
parity detection based Mach-Zehnder interferometry. To this end, we consider
the realistic model of photon subtraction, addition, and catalysis. We first
provide a derivation of the unified Wigner function of the photon subtracted,
photon added and photon catalyzed TMST state, which to the best of our
knowledge is not available in the existing literature. This Wigner function is
then used to obtain the expression for the phase sensitivity. Our results show
that performing non-Gaussian operations on TMST states can enhance the phase
sensitivity for significant ranges of squeezing and transmissivity parameters.
We also observe that incremental advantage provided by performing these
non-Gaussian operations on the TMST state is considerably higher than that of
performing these operations on the TMSV state. Because of the probabilistic
nature of these operations, it is of utmost importance to take their success
probability into account. We identify the photon catalysis operation performed
using a high transmissivity beam splitter as the optimal non-Gaussian operation
when the success probability is taken into account. This is in contrast to the
TMSV case, where we observe photon addition to be the most optimal. These
results will be of high relevance for any future phase estimation experiments
involving TMST states. Further, the derived Wigner function of the non-Gaussian
TMST states will be useful for state characterization and its application in
various quantum information protocols.

In this work, we combine principled physics-based considerations for the shape

approach. Modern and traditional analyses of 2D and 3D aerodynamic shapes
reveal a flow-based sensitivity to specific deformations that can be
represented generally by affine transformations (rotation, scaling, shearing,
translation). We present a novel representation of shapes that decouples
affine-style deformations over a submanifold and a product submanifold
principally of the Grassmannian. As an analytic generative model, the separable
representation, informed by a database of physically relevant airfoils, offers
(i) a rich set of novel 2D airfoil deformations not previously captured in the
data, (ii) an improved low-dimensional parameter domain for inferential
statistics informing design/manufacturing, and (iii) consistent 3D blade
representation and perturbation over a sequence of nominal 2D shapes.

properties are uniform in space but periodically vary in time. The synthesis of
such materials and experimental observation of their physics remain very
challenging due to the stringent requirement for uniform modulation of material
properties in volumetric samples. In this work, we extend the concept of
photonic time crystals to two-dimensional artificial structures --
metasurfaces. We demonstrate that time-varying metasurfaces not only preserve
key physical properties of volumetric photonic time crystals despite their
simpler topology but also host common momentum bandgaps shared by both surface
and free-space electromagnetic waves. Based on a microwave metasurface design,
we experimentally confirmed the exponential wave amplification inside a
momentum bandgap as well as the possibility to probe bandgap physics by
external (free-space) excitations. The proposed metasurface serves as a
straightforward material platform for realizing emerging photonic space-time
crystals and as a realistic system for the amplification of surface-wave
signals in future wireless communications.

classification accuracy and training efficiency by taking advantage of quantum
mechanics, known as quantum machine learning (QML). The variational quantum
circuit (VQC) is frequently utilized to build a quantum neural network (QNN),
which is a counterpart to the conventional neural network. Due to hardware
limitations, however, current quantum devices only allow one to use few qubits
to represent data and perform simple quantum computations. The limited quantum
resource on a single quantum device degrades the data usage and limits the
scale of the quantum circuits, preventing quantum advantage to some extent. To
alleviate this constraint, we propose an approach to implementing a scalable
quantum neural network (SQNN) by utilizing the quantum resource of multiple
small-size quantum devices cooperatively. In an SQNN system, several quantum
devices are used as quantum feature extractors, extracting local features from
an input instance in parallel, and a quantum device works as a quantum
predictor, performing prediction over the local features collected through
classical communication channels. The quantum feature extractors in the SQNN
system are independent of each other, so one can flexibly use quantum devices
of varying sizes, with larger quantum devices extracting more local features.
Especially, the SQNN can be performed on a single quantum device in a modular
fashion. Our work is exploratory and carried out on a quantum system simulator
using the TensorFlow Quantum library. The evaluation conducts a binary
classification on the MNIST dataset. It shows that the SQNN model achieves a
comparable classification accuracy to a regular QNN model of the same scale.
Furthermore, it demonstrates that the SQNN model with more quantum resources
can significantly improve classification accuracy.

conjectured that ""the variations of spot frequency depend on the influences of
Venus, Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn"". The high synchronization of our planetary
system is already nicely revealed by the fact that the ratios of the planetary
orbital radii are closely related to each other through a scaling-mirror
symmetry equation (Bank and Scafetta, Front. Astron. Space Sci. 8, 758184,
2022). Reviewing the many planetary harmonics and the orbital invariant
inequalities that characterize the planetary motions of the solar system from
the monthly to the millennial time scales, we show that they are not randomly
distributed but clearly tend to cluster around some specific values that also
match those of the main solar activity cycles. In some cases, planetary models
have even been able to predict the time-phase of the solar oscillations
including the Schwabe 11-year sunspot cycle. We also stress that solar models
based on the hypothesis that solar activity is regulated by its internal
dynamics alone have never been able to reproduce the variety of the observed
cycles. Although planetary tidal forces are weak, we review a number of
mechanisms that could explain how the solar structure and the solar dynamo
could get tuned to the planetary motions. In particular, we discuss how the
effects of the weak tidal forces could be significantly amplified in the solar
core by an induced increase in the H-burning. Mechanisms modulating the
electromagnetic and gravitational large-scale structure of the planetary system
are also discussed.

regarding the extent and inequality of disrupted access caused by weather
events. This study uses mobility data in the context of the 2017 Hurricane
Harvey in Harris County to examine the impact of flooding on access to dialysis
centers. We examined access dimensions using multiple static and dynamic
metrics. By analyzing fluctuations in dynamic metrics during the flood event,
we derived spatiotemporal patterns of access disruptions and inequity in
mobility from CBGs to dialysis centers. The results show that: (1) the extent
of dependence of CBGs on dialysis centers varies; (2) flooding significantly
reduces access redundancy and frequency of dialysis center visits; access
disruptions persist for more than one month after the flood event; (3) CBGs
with a greater minority percentage and lower household income were more likely
to experience more extensive access disruptions; (4) high-income CBGs more
quickly revert to their pre-disaster levels; (5) larger dialysis centers
located in non-flooded areas are critical to absorbing the unmet demand from
disrupted facilities; these larger facilities contribute to the absorptive
capacity of the network of dialysis facilities in the region.
