In fact we go further than this, by showing that linear {\lambda}-theories
based on this V-equational system form a category that is equivalent to a

we instantiate this result to inequations, we get an equivalence with
autonomous categories enriched over partial orders. In the case of

annotations) for training a more generalizable AI model has been widely
recognized in medical image analysis. However, collecting large-scale
task-specific unannotated data at scale can be challenging for individual labs.
Existing online resources, such as digital books, publications, and search
engines, provide a new resource for obtaining large-scale images. However,
published images in healthcare (e.g., radiology and pathology) consist of a
considerable amount of compound figures with subplots. In order to extract and
separate compound figures into usable individual images for downstream
learning, we propose a simple compound figure separation (SimCFS) framework
without using the traditionally required detection bounding box annotations,
with a new loss function and a hard case simulation. Our technical contribution
is four-fold: (1) we introduce a simulation-based training framework that
minimizes the need for resource extensive bounding box annotations; (2) we
propose a new side loss that is optimized for compound figure separation; (3)
we propose an intra-class image augmentation method to simulate hard cases; and
(4) to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the
efficacy of leveraging self-supervised learning with compound image separation.
From the results, the proposed SimCFS achieved state-of-the-art performance on

replaces hand-labeling data with aggregating multiple noisy-but-cheap label
estimates expressed by labeling functions (LFs). While it has been used
successfully in many domains, weak supervision's application scope is limited
by the difficulty of constructing labeling functions for domains with complex
or high-dimensional features. To address this, a handful of methods have
proposed automating the LF design process using a small set of ground truth
labels. In this work, we introduce AutoWS-Bench-101: a framework for evaluating
automated WS (AutoWS) techniques in challenging WS settings -- a set of diverse
application domains on which it has been previously difficult or impossible to
apply traditional WS techniques. While AutoWS is a promising direction toward
expanding the application-scope of WS, the emergence of powerful methods such
as zero-shot foundation models reveals the need to understand how AutoWS
techniques compare or cooperate with modern zero-shot or few-shot learners.
This informs the central question of AutoWS-Bench-101: given an initial set of
100 labels for each task, we ask whether a practitioner should use an AutoWS
method to generate additional labels or use some simpler baseline, such as
zero-shot predictions from a foundation model or supervised learning. We
observe that in many settings, it is necessary for AutoWS methods to
incorporate signal from foundation models if they are to outperform simple
few-shot baselines, and AutoWS-Bench-101 promotes future research in this
direction. We conclude with a thorough ablation study of AutoWS methods.

images with the same identity from the image gallery given a query text
description. In recent years, text-based person search has made good progress,
and state-of-the-art methods achieve superior performance by learning local
fine-grained correspondence between images and texts. However, the existing
methods explicitly extract image parts and text phrases from images and texts
by hand-crafted split or external tools and then conduct complex cross-modal
local matching. Moreover, the existing methods seldom consider the problem of
information inequality between modalities caused by image-specific information.
In this paper, we propose an efficient joint Information and Semantic Alignment
Network (ISANet) for text-based person search. Specifically, we first design an
image-specific information suppression module, which suppresses image
background and environmental factors by relation-guide localization and channel
attention filtration respectively. This design can effectively alleviate the
problem of information inequality and realize the information alignment between
images and texts. Secondly, we propose an implicit local alignment module to
adaptively aggregate image and text features to a set of modality-shared
semantic topic centers, and implicitly learn the local fine-grained
correspondence between images and texts without additional supervision
information and complex cross-modal interactions. Moreover, a global alignment
is introduced as a supplement to the local perspective. Extensive experiments
on multiple databases demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the
proposed ISANet.

selects new values of $\alpha$ and $u$ based on the numerical solution of the
discrete Vlasov-Poisson system obtained at that time step. Once the new values
of the Hermite parameters $\alpha$ and $u$ are fixed, the Hermite expansion is
updated and the discrete system is further evolved for the next time step. The
procedure is applied iteratively over the desired temporal interval. The key
aspects of the adaptive algorithm are: the map between approximation spaces
associated with different values of the Hermite parameters that preserves total
mass, momentum and energy; and the adaptivity criterion to update $\alpha$ and
$u$ based on physics considerations relating the Hermite parameters to the
average velocity and temperature of each plasma species. For the discretization
of the spatial coordinate, we rely on Fourier functions and use the implicit
midpoint rule for time stepping. The resulting numerical method possesses
intrinsically the property of fluid-kinetic coupling, where the low-order terms
of the expansion are akin to the fluid moments of a macroscopic description of
the plasma, while kinetic physics is retained by adding more spectral terms.
Moreover, the scheme features conservation of total mass, momentum and energy

Regressor for predicting the mediastinal fat based on the epicardial fat was
0.9876, with a relative absolute error of 14.4% and a root relative squared
error of 15.7%. The best correlation coefficient obtained in the prediction of
the epicardial fat based on the mediastinal was 0.9683 with a relative absolute
error of 19.6% and a relative squared error of 24.9%. Moreover, we analysed the
feasibility of using linear regressors, which provide an intuitive
interpretation of the underlying approximations. In this case, the obtained
correlation coefficient was 0.9534 for predicting the mediastinal fat based on
the epicardial, with a relative absolute error of 31.6% and a root relative
squared error of 30.1%. On the prediction of the epicardial fat based on the
mediastinal fat, the correlation coefficient was 0.8531, with a relative
absolute error of 50.43% and a root relative squared error of 52.06%. In
summary, it is possible to speed up general medical analyses and some
segmentation and quantification methods that are currently employed in the
state-of-the-art by using this prediction approach, which consequently reduces
costs and therefore enables preventive treatments that may lead to a reduction
of health problems.

pericardium contour and, consequently, separates appropriately the epicardial

the pericardium may improve previously proposed automated methodologies that

  Q-Networks","Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Base stations (BSs) are the most energy-consuming segment of mobile networks.
To reduce BS energy consumption, different components of BSs can sleep when BS
is not active. According to the activation/deactivation time of the BS
components, multiple sleep modes (SMs) are defined in the literature. In this
study, we model the problem of BS energy saving utilizing multiple sleep modes
as a sequential MDP and propose an online traffic-aware deep reinforcement
learning approach to maximize the long-term energy saving. However, there is a
risk that BS is not sleeping at the right time and incurs large delays to the
users. To tackle this issue, we propose to use a digital twin model to
encapsulate the dynamics underlying the investigated system and estimate the
risk of decision-making (RDM) in advance. We define a novel metric to quantify
RDM and predict the performance degradation. The RDM calculated by DT is
compared with a tolerable threshold set by the mobile operator. Based on this
comparison, BS can decide to deactivate the SMs, re-train when needed to avoid
taking high risks, or activate the SMs to benefit from energy savings. For deep
reinforcement learning, we use long-short term memory (LSTM), to take into
account the long and short-term dependencies in input traffic, and approximate
the Q-function. We train the LSTM network using the experience replay method
over a real traffic data set obtained from an operator BS in Stockholm. The
data set contains data rate information with very coarse-grained time
granularity. Thus, we propose a scheme to generate a new data set using the
real network data set which 1) has finer-grained time granularity and 2)
considers the bursty behavior of traffic data. Simulation results show that
using proposed methods, considerable energy saving is obtained, compared to the

as any changes may lead to unintended consequences, and it can be hard to
predict how users will react. Here we conduct a case study of a particularly
important real-world platform design change: Twitter's decision to double the
character limit from 140 to 280 characters to soothe users' need to ''cram'' or
''squeeze'' their tweets, informed by modeling of historical user behavior. In
our analysis, we contrast Twitter's anticipated pre-intervention predictions
about user behavior with actual post-intervention user behavior: Did the
platform design change lead to the intended user behavior shifts, or did a gap
between anticipated and actual behavior emerge? Did different user groups react
differently? We find that even though users do not ''cram'' as much under 280
characters as they used to under 140 characters, emergent ``cramming'' at the
new limit seems to not have been taken into account when designing the platform
change. Furthermore, investigating textual features, we find that, although
post-intervention ''crammed'' tweets are longer, their syntactic and semantic
characteristics remain similar and indicative of ''squeezing''. Applying the
same approach as Twitter policy-makers, we create updated counterfactual
estimates and find that the character limit would need to be increased further
to reduce cramming that re-emerged at the new limit. We contribute to the rich
literature studying online user behavior with an empirical study that reveals a
dynamic interaction between platform design and user behavior, with immediate
policy and practical implications for the design of socio-technical systems.

closed-loop control was developed. O-RAN slicing is being investigated as a
critical strategy for ensuring network quality of service (QoS) in the face of
changing circumstances. However, distinct network slices must be dynamically
controlled to avoid service level agreement (SLA) variation caused by rapid
changes in the environment. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel framework
able to manage the network slices through provisioned resources intelligently.
Due to diverse heterogeneous environments, intelligent machine learning
approaches require sufficient exploration to handle the harshest situations in
a wireless network and accelerate convergence. To solve this problem, a new
solution is proposed based on evolutionary-based deep reinforcement learning
(EDRL) to accelerate and optimize the slice management learning process in the
radio access network's (RAN) intelligent controller (RIC) modules. To this end,
the O-RAN slicing is represented as a Markov decision process (MDP) which is
then solved optimally for resource allocation to meet service demand using the
EDRL approach. In terms of reaching service demands, simulation results show
that the proposed approach outperforms the DRL baseline by 62.2%.

study the transport of particles in an evaporating binary droplet.
Surprisingly, the accumulation of particles occurs not only at the contact line
(due to the coffee-stain effect) or at the solid substrate (due to
sedimentation), but also at a particular radial position near the liquid-air
interface, forming a ""ring"", which we term as the Marangoni ring. The formation
of this ring is primarily attributed to the solutal Marangoni flow triggered by
the evaporation dynamics of the water-glycerol droplet. Experiments and
simulations show fair agreement in the volume evolution and the general
structure of the solutal Marangoni flow, that is, the Marangoni vortex.
Experiments show that the location of the Marangoni ring is strongly correlated
with the Marangoni vortex. However, finite element numerical simulations fail
to describe the particle distribution seen in the experiments. Interestingly,

using different observables. It has been reported earlier that this data shows
a strong signal of dipole anisotropy in the source number counts. We test this
claim using two independent data analysis procedures and find our number count
dipole consistent with the earlier results. In addition to number counts, we
test for the anisotropy signal in two other observables -- mean spectral index
$\bar{\alpha}$ and mean flux density $\bar{B}$. We find a dipole signal of
considerable strength both in the mean spectral index and the mean flux
density. The dipole in mean flux density points towards the galactic center and
becomes very weak after imposing a flux cut to remove sources with flux greater
than 1 mJy. This can be attributed to the presence of some bright sources. The
signal in mean spectral index, however, is relatively stable as a function of
both flux and galactic cuts. The dipole in this observable points roughly
opposite to the galactic center and hence most likely arises due to galactic
bias. Hence, the signal in both the mean spectral index and mean flux density
appears to be consistent with isotropy.

(RV) measurements of the host star or time-series modeling of transit timing
variations (TTVs) in multiplanet systems; however, the majority of Kepler hosts
are too dim for RV follow-up, and only a select number of systems have strong
enough TTVs for time-series modeling. Here, we develop a method of constraining
planet mass in multiplanet systems using low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) TTVs.
For a sample of 175 planets in 79 multiplanet systems from the
California-Kepler Survey, we infer posteriors on planet mass using publicly
available TTV time-series from Kepler. For 53 planets ($>30\%$ of our sample),
low-S/N TTVs yield informative upper bounds on planet mass, i.e., the mass
constraint strongly deviates from the prior on mass and yields a physically
reasonable bulk composition. For 25 small planets, low-S/N TTVs favor
volatile-rich compositions. Where available, low-S/N TTV-based mass constraints
are consistent with RV-derived masses. TTV time-series are publicly available
for each Kepler planet, and the compactness of Kepler systems makes TTV-based
constraints informative for a substantial fraction of multiplanet systems.
Leveraging low-S/N TTVs offers a valuable path toward increasing the available
mass constraints of the Kepler sample.

  Digital Traces",,,"10.1145/3555660",,"cs.SI cs.CY cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Given that measuring food consumption at a population scale is a challenging
task, researchers have begun to explore digital traces (e.g., from social media
or from food-tracking applications) as potential proxies. However, it remains
unclear to what extent digital traces reflect real food consumption. The
present study aims to bridge this gap by quantifying the link between dietary
behaviors as captured via social media (Twitter) v.s. a food-tracking
application (MyFoodRepo). We focus on the case of Switzerland and contrast
images of foods collected through the two platforms, by designing and deploying
a novel crowdsourcing framework for estimating biases with respect to
nutritional properties and appearance. We find that the food type distributions
in social media v.s. food tracking diverge; e.g., bread is 2.5 times more
frequent among consumed and tracked foods than on Twitter, whereas cake is 12
times more frequent on Twitter. Controlling for the different food type
distributions, we contrast consumed and tracked foods of a given type with
foods shared on Twitter. Across food types, food posted on Twitter is perceived
as tastier, more caloric, less healthy, less likely to have been consumed at
home, more complex, and larger-portioned, compared to consumed and tracked
foods. The fact that there is a divergence between food consumption as measured
via the two platforms implies that at least one of the two is not a faithful
representation of the true food consumption in the general Swiss population.
Thus, researchers should be attentive and aim to establish evidence of validity
before using digital traces as a proxy for the true food consumption of a
general population. We conclude by discussing the potential sources of these
biases and their implications, outlining pitfalls and threats to validity, and
proposing actionable ways for overcoming them.

expectations in which the numerator and denominator correspond to expectations
defined over paths that start and end within a given return set $K$. When $K$
is a singleton, this representation is a well-known consequence of regenerative
process theory. For computational tractability, we ignore contributions to the
path expectations corresponding to excursions out of a given truncation set
$A$. This yields a truncation algorithm that is provably convergent as $A$ gets
large. Furthermore, in the presence of a suitable Lyapunov function, we can
bound the path expectations, thereby providing computable and convergent error
bounds for our numerical procedure. Our paper also provides a computational
comparison with two other truncation methods that come with computable error
bounds. The results are in alignment with the observation that our bounds have
associated computational complexities that typically scale better as the

structures inside other classes of structures, and several important class
properties can be defined in terms of transductions. In this paper we study
first-order (FO) transductions and the quasiorder they induce on infinite
classes of finite graphs. Surprisingly, this quasiorder is very complex, though
shaped by the locality properties of first-order logic. This contrasts with the
conjectured simplicity of the monadic second order (MSO) transduction
quasiorder. We first establish a local normal form for FO transductions, which
is of independent interest. This normal form allows to prove, among other
results, that the local variants of (monadic) stability and (monadic)
dependence are equivalent to their non-local versions. Then we prove that the
quotient partial order is a bounded distributive join-semilattice, and that the
subposet of additive classes is also a bounded distributive join-semilattice.
We characterize transductions of paths, cubic graphs, and cubic trees in terms
of bandwidth, bounded degree, and treewidth. We establish that the classes of
all graphs with pathwidth at most $k$, for $k\geq 1$ form a strict hierarchy in
the FO transduction quasiorder and leave open whether the same holds for the
classes of all graphs with treewidth at most $k$. We identify the obstructions
for a class to be a transduction of a class with bounded degree, leading to an
interesting transduction duality formulation. Eventually, we discuss a notion
of dense analogs of sparse transduction-preserved class properties, and propose
several related conjectures.

vision, natural language processing, multi-modal and tabular settings. We note
that, as compared to other well researched fields fraud detection has numerous
differences. The differences include a high class imbalance, diverse feature
types, frequently changing fraud patterns, and adversarial nature of the
problem. Due to these differences, the modeling approaches that are designed
for other classification tasks may not work well for the fraud detection. We
introduce Fraud Dataset Benchmark (FDB), a compilation of publicly available
datasets catered to fraud detection. FDB comprises variety of fraud related
tasks, ranging from identifying fraudulent card-not-present transactions,
detecting bot attacks, classifying malicious URLs, predicting risk of loan to
content moderation. The Python based library from FDB provides consistent API
for data loading with standardized training and testing splits. For reference,
we also provide baseline evaluations of different modeling approaches on FDB.
Considering the increasing popularity of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)
for various research and business problems, we used AutoML frameworks for our
baseline evaluations. For fraud prevention, the organizations that operate with
limited resources and lack ML expertise often hire a team of investigators, use
blocklists and manual rules, all of which are inefficient and do not scale
well. Such organizations can benefit from AutoML solutions that are easy to
deploy in production and pass the bar of fraud prevention requirements. We hope
that FDB helps in the development of customized fraud detection techniques
catered to different fraud modus operandi (MOs) as well as in the improvement
of AutoML systems that can work well for all datasets in the benchmark.

that the (hybrid) finite element space for the global HDG facet degrees of

discontinuous piecewise linear space is used for the approximation of the local
primal unknowns. We give the optimal a priori error analysis of the proposed
{\sf HDG-P0} schemes, which hasn't appeared in the literature yet for HDG
discretizations as far as numerical integration is concerned.
  Moreover, we propose optimal geometric multigrid preconditioners for the
statically condensed HDG-P0 linear systems on conforming simplicial meshes. In
both cases, we first establish the equivalence of the statically condensed HDG
system with a (slightly modified) nonconforming Crouzeix-Raviart (CR)
discretization, where the global (piecewise-constant) HDG finite element space
on the mesh skeleton has a natural one-to-one correspondence to the
nonconforming CR (piecewise-linear) finite element space that live on the whole

geometry multigrid theory to precondition the condensed HDG system. Numerical
results in two- and three-dimensions are presented to verify our theoretical

theoretical perspective, we introduce a duopoly market where platform actions
are bandit algorithms and the two platforms compete for user participation. A
salient feature of this market is that the quality of recommendations depends
on both the bandit algorithm and the amount of data provided by interactions

Interestingly, market outcomes exhibit misalignment not only when the platforms
have separate data repositories, but also when the platforms have a shared data
repository. Nonetheless, the data sharing assumptions impact what mechanism
drives misalignment and also affect the specific form of misalignment (e.g. the
quality of the best-case and worst-case market outcomes). More broadly, our
work illustrates that competition in digital marketplaces has subtle
consequences for user utility that merit further investigation.

dependent, random experiment. In the classical world, entropy and conditional
entropy take only non-negative values, consistent with the intuition that one
has regarding the aforementioned interpretations. However, for certain
entangled states, one obtains negative values when evaluating commonly accepted
and information-theoretically justified formulas for the quantum conditional
entropy, leading to the confounding conclusion that one can know less than
nothing in the quantum world. Here, we introduce a physically motivated
framework for defining quantum conditional entropy, based on two simple
postulates inspired by the second law of thermodynamics (non-decrease of
entropy) and extensivity of entropy, and we argue that all plausible
definitions of quantum conditional entropy should respect these two postulates.
We then prove that all plausible quantum conditional entropies take on negative
values for certain entangled states, so that it is inevitable that one can know

constructions of physical processes that respect the first postulate, the one
inspired by the second law of thermodynamics.

incorporating an orbital optimization scheme into quantum eigensolvers wherein
a parameterized partial unitary transformation is applied to the basis

energy with respect to this partial unitary matrix. Through numerical
simulations of small molecules up to 16 spin orbitals, we demonstrate that this
method has the ability to greatly extend the capabilities of near-term quantum

present evidence that adding a weak harmonic potential does not result in

model to study rotating neutron stars with hyperon cores in the framework of
the relativistic mean-field theory. The inclusion of mesonic cross couplings in
the model has improved the density content of the symmetry energy slope
parameters, which are in agreement with the findings from recent terrestrial
experiments. The bulk viscosity of the hyperonic medium is analyzed to
investigate its role in the suppression of gravitationally driven $r$-modes.
The hyperonic bulk viscosity coefficient caused by non-leptonic weak
interactions and the corresponding damping timescales are calculated and the
$r$-mode instability windows are obtained. The present model predicts a
significant reduction of the unstable region due to a more effective damping of
oscillations. We find that from $\sim 10^8$ K to $\sim 10^{9}$ K, hyperonic
bulk viscosity completely suppresses the $r$-modes leading to a stable region
between the instability windows. Our analysis indicates that the instability
can reduce the angular velocity of the star up to $\sim$0.3~$\Omega_K$, where
$\Omega_K$ is the Kepler frequency of the star.

construction. We propose a unified permutation-equivalent modeling approach,
i.e., modeling map element as a point set with a group of equivalent
permutations, which accurately describes the shape of map element and
stabilizes the learning process. We design a hierarchical query embedding
scheme to flexibly encode structured map information and perform hierarchical
bipartite matching for map element learning. MapTR achieves the best
performance and efficiency with only camera input among existing vectorized map
construction approaches on nuScenes dataset. In particular, MapTR-nano runs at
real-time inference speed ($25.1$ FPS) on RTX 3090, $8\times$ faster than the
existing state-of-the-art camera-based method while achieving $5.0$ higher mAP.
Even compared with the existing state-of-the-art multi-modality method,
MapTR-nano achieves $0.7$ higher mAP, and MapTR-tiny achieves $13.5$ higher mAP

MapTR maintains stable and robust map construction quality in complex and

parameters that are normalized, monotone under restrictions, additive under

the flattening ranks. Over the complex numbers, a refinement of this problem,
originating in the theory of quantum entanglement, is to find the optimal rate
of entanglement transformations as a function of the error exponent. This
trade-off can also be characterized in terms of the set of normalized,
additive, multiplicative functionals that are monotone in a suitable sense,
which includes the restriction-monotones as well. For example, the flattening
ranks generalize to the (exponentiated) R\'enyi entanglement entropies of order
$\alpha\in[0,1]$. More complicated parameters of this type are known, which
interpolate between the flattening ranks or R\'enyi entropies for special
bipartitions, with one of the parts being a single tensor factor.
  We introduce a new construction of subadditive and submultiplicative
monotones in terms of a regularized R\'enyi divergence between many copies of
the pure state represented by the tensor and a suitable sequence of positive
operators. We give explicit families of operators that correspond to the
flattening-based functionals, and show that they can be combined in a
nontrivial way using weighted operator geometric means. This leads to a new
characterization of the previously known additive and multiplicative monotones,
and gives new submultiplicative and subadditive monotones that interpolate
between the R\'enyi entropies for all bipartitions. We show that for each such
monotone there exist pointwise smaller multiplicative and additive ones as
well. In addition, we find lower bounds on the new functionals that are
superadditive and supermultiplicative.

functions for the position as well as velocity are exactly calculated using
different methods. We explore how the inertia affects the dynamical behaviour,
when the particle is confined in a harmonic trap as well as when it is set
free. From the exact calculation of MSD, it is observed that the initial time
regimes are ballistic for both harmonically confined particle and free
particle, whereas the long time regimes are diffusive for a free particle and
non diffusive for a harmonically confined particle. One of our interesting
observation is that the harmonically confined particle gets more and more
confined with increase in the self propulsion time or activity time of the
dynamics and finally it gets trapped for very large self propulsion time. For a
free particle, the velocity correlation decays by the complex interplay between
the inertial time scale and the self propulsion time scale of the dynamics.
Moreover, decorrelation in velocity happens only when these two time scales are
of equal order.

radiomics features extracted from PET/CT images acquired before and after
radiotherapy as the input features. Using clinical parameters, PET and CT
radiomics features, we built and optimized three separate single-modality
models. We used multiple classifiers for model construction and employed
sensitivity and specificity simultaneously as the training objectives. For
testing samples, we fused the output probabilities from all these
single-modality models to obtain the final output probabilities of the
Delta-mCOM model. In the LRO strategy, we estimated the epistemic and aleatoric
uncertainties when predicting with Delta-mCOM model and identified patients
associated with prediction of higher reliability. Predictions with higher
epistemic uncertainty or higher aleatoric uncertainty than given thresholds
were deemed unreliable, and they were rejected before providing a final
prediction. Different thresholds corresponding to different low-reliability
prediction rejection ratios were applied. The inclusion of the delta-radiomics
feature improved the accuracy of HNC LRR prediction, and the proposed
Delta-mCOM model can give more reliable predictions by rejecting predictions

functions on the same PPIC simultaneously. However, we do not need to separate
the functions spatially into different subdomains of the mesh, and the
resulting optimum can have multiple functions using the same part of the mesh.

material responsible for broad absorption lines in the observed spectrum. These
include SNe that are associated with long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and
low-luminosity GRBs (llGRBs), and SNe that are not associated with GRBs.
Recently it was suggested that this high velocity material originates from a
cocoon that is driven by a relativistic jet. In LGRBs this jet breaks out
successfully from the stellar envelope, while in llGRBs and SNe that are not
associated with GRBs the jet is choked. Here we use numerical simulations to
explore the velocity distribution of an outflow that is driven by a choked jet
and its dependence on the jet and progenitor properties. We find that in all
cases where the jet is not choked too deep within the star, the outflow carries
a roughly constant amount of energy per logarithmic scale of proper velocity
over a wide range of velocities, which depends mostly on the cocoon volume at
the time of its breakout. This is a universal property of jets driven outflows,
which does not exist in outflows of spherically symmetric explosions or when
the jets are choked very deep within the star. We therefore conclude that jets
that are choked (not too deep) provide a natural explanation to the fast
material seen in the early spectra of stripped envelope SNe that are not
associated with LGRBs and that properties of this material could reveal
information on the otherwise hidden jets.

stars, an effect known as astrometric microlensing (AML). We present a novel
calculation of the lensing probability, and we combine this with the existing
publicly released Gaia eDR3 stellar catalog to predict the expected rate of AML
events that Gaia will see. We also compute the expected distribution of a few
event observables, which will be useful for reducing backgrounds. Assuming that
the astrophysical background rate of AML like events due to other sources is
negligible, we then compute the potential exclusion that could be set on the
parameter space of PBHs with a monochromatic mass function. We find that Gaia
is sensitive to PBHs in the range of $0.4~M_\odot$ - $5\times10^7~M_\odot$, and
has peak sensitivity to PBHs of $\sim 10~M_\odot$ for which it can rule out as
little as a fraction $3\times10^{-4}$ of dark matter composed of PBHs. With
this exquisite sensitivity, Gaia has the potential to rule out a PBH origin for
the gravitational wave signals seen at LIGO/Virgo. Our novel calculation of the
lensing probability includes for the first time, the effect of intermediate
duration lensing events, where the lensing event lasts for a few years, but for
a period which is still shorter than the Gaia mission lifetime. The lower end
of our predicted mass exclusion is especially sensitive to this class of
events. As and when time-series data for Gaia is released, and once we have a
better understanding of the backgrounds, our prediction of the lensing rate and
event observable distributions will be useful to estimate the true
exclusion/discovery of the PBH parameter space utilizing this data.

Nuclei (AGN) identified at $3 < z < 5$ in the first epoch of imaging from the
Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS). Each galaxy has been
imaged with the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (\jwst) Near-Infrared
Camera (NIRCam), which provides spatially resolved, rest-frame optical
morphologies at these redshifts. We also derive stellar masses and star
formation rates for each host galaxy by fitting its spectral energy
distribution using a combination of galaxy and AGN templates. The AGN hosts
have an average stellar mass of ${\rm log}(M_{*}/{\rm M_{\odot}} )= 11.0$,
making them among the most massive galaxies detected at this redshift range in
the current CEERS pointings, even after accounting for nuclear light from the
AGN. We find that three of the AGN hosts have spheroidal morphologies, one is a
bulge-dominated disk and one host is dominated by point-like emission. None are
found to show strong morphological disturbances that might indicate a recent
interaction or merger event. Notably, all four of the resolved hosts have
rest-frame optical colors consistent with a quenched or post-starburst stellar
population. The presence of AGN in passively evolving galaxies at $z>3$ is
significant because a rapid feedback mechanism is required in most
semi-analytic models and cosmological simulations to explain the growing
population of massive quiescent galaxies observed at these redshifts. Our
findings are in general agreement with this picture and show that AGN can
continue to inject energy into these systems after their star formation is
curtailed, possibly helping to maintain their quiescent state.

important biomarkers of disease status. However, brain imaging studies to
identify these biomarkers often encounter limited numbers of subjects and high
dimensional imaging features, hindering reproducibility. Therefore, we develop
an interpretable, multivariate classification/regression algorithm, called
Latent Similarity (LatSim), suitable for small sample size, high feature
dimension datasets. Methods: LatSim combines metric learning with a kernel
similarity function and softmax aggregation to identify task-related
similarities between subjects. Inter-subject similarity is utilized to improve
performance on three prediction tasks using multi-paradigm fMRI data. A greedy
selection algorithm, made possible by LatSim's computational efficiency, is
developed as an interpretability method. Results: LatSim achieved significantly
higher predictive accuracy at small sample sizes on the Philadelphia
Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) dataset. Connections identified by LatSim gave
superior discriminative power compared to those identified by other methods. We
identified 4 functional brain networks enriched in connections for predicting
brain age, sex, and intelligence. Conclusion: We find that most information for
a predictive task comes from only a few (1-5) connections. Additionally, we
find that the default mode network is over-represented in the top connections
of all predictive tasks. Significance: We propose a novel algorithm for small
sample, high feature dimension datasets and use it to identify connections in
task fMRI data. Our work should lead to new insights in both algorithm design

extensive study in Newtonian mechanics, which also explains the motion of

a backflipping behavior when they collide with a tilted surface. Our
experiments reveal that bubbles with radii 0.6-0.7 mm undergo backflipping when
they collide with surfaces at an angle of up to 15^o with the strongest
backflipping at 3^o. Particle image velocimetry reveals that the backflipping
behavior is caused by wake-induced circulation around the bubble, which applies
a lift force on the bubble. We develop a theoretical model that incorporates
potential flow theory to characterize the circulation caused by the interaction
between the bouncing bubble and its wake. The theoretical results are in good

force in backflipping. Finally, we show that the backflipping behavior of air

return erroneous predictions. Such unsafe behaviour is particularly frequent
when the use case slightly differs from the training context, and/or in the
presence of an adversary. This work presents a novel direction to address these
issues in a broad, general manner: imposing class-aware constraints on a
model's internal activation patterns. Specifically, we assign to each class a
unique, fixed, randomly-generated binary vector - hereafter called class code -
and train the model so that its cross-depths activation patterns predict the
appropriate class code according to the input sample's class. The resulting
predictors are dubbed Total Activation Classifiers (TAC), and TACs may either
be trained from scratch, or used with negligible cost as a thin add-on on top
of a frozen, pre-trained neural network. The distance between a TAC's
activation pattern and the closest valid code acts as an additional confidence
score, besides the default unTAC'ed prediction head's. In the add-on case, the
original neural network's inference head is completely unaffected (so its
accuracy remains the same) but we now have the option to use TAC's own
confidence and prediction when determining which course of action to take in an
hypothetical production workflow. In particular, we show that TAC strictly
improves the value derived from models allowed to reject/defer. We provide
further empirical evidence that TAC works well on multiple types of
architectures and data modalities and that it is at least as good as
state-of-the-art alternative confidence scores derived from existing models.

one of the challenging parts of the variational quantum eigensolver. A widely
used strategy is to express the Hamiltonian as a sum of measurable fragments

conserving molecular symmetries that can be used for error mitigation. The
number of measurements required to obtain the Hamiltonian expectation value is
proportional to a sum of fragment variances. Here, we introduce a new method
for lowering the fragments' variances by exploiting flexibility in the
fragments' form. Due to idempotency of the occupation number operators, some
parts of two-electron fragments can be turned into one-electron fragments,
which then can be partially collected in a purely one-electron fragment. This
repartitioning does not affect the expectation value of the Hamiltonian but has
non-vanishing contributions to the variance of each fragment. The proposed
method finds the optimal repartitioning by employing variances estimated using
a classically efficient proxy for the quantum wavefunction. Numerical tests on
several molecules show that repartitioning of one-electron terms lowers the
number of measurements by more than an order of magnitude.

However, supernova remnants can power the observed flux of cosmic rays only if
they transfer a significant fraction of their kinetic energy to the accelerated
particles, but conclusive evidence for such efficient acceleration is still
lacking. In this scenario, the shock energy channeled to cosmic rays should
induce a higher post-shock density than that predicted by standard shock

almost completely unknown. The only known case is when $n=\binom{k}{2}$ is a
triangular number, in which case there is only one orbit. Eriksson and Jonsson
gave an analysis for convergence of the structure as $k$ grows, and to what
extent the limit applied to the finite case. In this article, we generalize the
convergent structure for orbits of Bulgarian Solitaire system for any $n$. For
necklaces of the form $(BW)^k = BWBW\cdots$, we give the precise limit of the

the transport of angular momentum in the stellar interiors. Asteroseismology
offers a powerful tool for measuring the internal rotation frequencies of

describe the relative importance of rotation, for the gravito-inertial mode
oscillations show that for 40 of the stars the oscillations fall within the
sub-inertial regime. We find that the core rotation frequencies of the stars
decrease as a function of age, and show evidence of angular momentum transport

each self-dual particle $a$ in a TQFT. If $\kappa_a$ is negative then
straightening out a timelike zig-zag in the worldline of a particle of type $a$
can incur a minus sign and in this case the amplitude associated with the
diagram is not invariant under deformation. This has caused some confusion
about the topological invariance of even simple theories to space-time
deformations. We clarify that, given a TQFT with negative Frobenius-Schur
indicators, there are two distinct conventions commonly used to interpret a
spacetime diagram as a physical amplitude, only one of which is isotopy
invariant. We clarify in what sense TQFTs based on Chern-Simons theory with
negative Frobenius-Schur indicators are isotopy invariant, and we explain how
the Frobenius-Schur indicator is intimately linked with the need to frame
world-lines in Chern-Simons theory. Further, in the non-isotopy-invariant
interpretation of the diagram algebra we show how a trick of bookkeeping can
usually be invoked to push minus signs onto the diagrammatic value of a loop
(the ""loop weight""), such that most of the evaluation of a diagram does not
incur minus signs from straightening zig-zags, and only at the last step minus
signs are added. We explain the conditions required for this to be possible. We
then further examine what is required in order for a theory to have full
isotopy invariance of planar spacetime diagrams, and discover that, if we have
successfully pushed the signs from zig-zags onto the loop weight, the only
possible obstruction to this is given by an object related to vertices, known
as the ""third Frobenius-Schur indicator"". We finally discuss the extent to
which this gives us full isotopy invariance for braided theories.

benefits of model-based RL without requiring a model to be developed in

behaviours, or dynamics not trivially reducible to its constituent elements, is
one of the defining properties of complex systems. Recently, there has been a
concerted effort to formally define emergence using the mathematical framework
of information theory, which proposes that emergence can be understood in terms
of how the states of wholes and parts collectively disclose information about
the system's collective future. In this paper, we show how a common,
foundational component of information-theoretic approaches to emergence implies
an inherent instability to emergent properties, which we call flickering
emergence. A system may on average display a meaningful emergent property (be
it an informative coarse-graining, or higher-order synergy), but for particular
configurations, that emergent property falls apart and becomes misinformative.
We show existence proofs that flickering emergence occurs in two different
frameworks (one based on coarse-graining and another based on multivariate
information decomposition) and argue that any approach based on temporal mutual
information will display it. Finally, we argue that flickering emergence should
not be a disqualifying property of any model of emergence, but that it should
be accounted for when attempting to theorize about how emergence relates to
practical models of the natural world.

tracking events affecting the driveable vehicle speeds on the links, thus
enabling us to incorporate both recurrent and non-recurrent effects. It allows

the conditions in the road network, and thus the state of the background
process, may change between the time of request and the advised time of
departure, we consider an online version of this procedure as well, in which
the traveler receives departure time updates while still at the origin.
Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to exemplify a selection of
properties of the optimal departure time and, moreover, quantify the
performance of the presented algorithms in an existing road network -- the
Dutch highway network.

We show from tunneling spectroscopy that there are electronic states deeply

presence of chemical defects in the layers. We also show a significant change
in the local bandgap on the bubble, with a continuous evolution to the edge of
the bubble over a length scale of ~20 nm. Nano-PL measurements observe a
continuous redshift of the interlayer exciton on entering the bubble, in
agreement with the band to band transitions measured by STM. We use
self-consistent Schr\""odinger-Poisson (SP) simulations to capture the essence

for Gemini North providing a state-of-the-art AO system for surveys and time

capabilities of GNAO, any instrument operating with an f/32 beam can be
deployed using GNAO.
  The GNAO project includes the development of a new laser guide star facility
which will consist of four side-launched laser beams supporting the two primary
AO modes of GNAO: a wide-field mode providing an improved image quality over
natural seeing for a 2-arcminute circular field-of-view and a narrow-field mode
providing near diffraction-limited performance over a 20x20 arcsecond square
field-of-view. The GNAO wide field mode will enable GIRMOS's multi-IFU
configuration in which the science beam to each individual IFU will be
additionally corrected using multi-object AO within GIRMOS. The GNAO narrow
field mode will feed the GIRMOS tiled IFU configuration in which all IFUs are
combined into a ""super""-IFU in the center of the field.
  GNAO also includes the development of a new Real Time Controller, a new GNAO
Facility System Controller and finally the development of a new AO Bench. We
present in this paper an overview of the GNAO facility and provide a status

planet's effective temperature increases from 400K to over 1400K in a few hours
as it makes a rapid passage to within 0.03AU of its host star during periapsis.
Spectroscopic observations during the eclipse (which is conveniently oriented a
few hours before periapsis) of HD80606b with the James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST) are poised to exploit this highly variable environment to study a wide
variety of atmospheric properties, including composition, chemical and
dynamical timescales, and large scale atmospheric motions. Critical to planning
and interpreting these observations is an accurate knowledge of the planet's
orbit. We report on observations of two full-transit events: 7 February 2020 as
observed by the TESS spacecraft and 7--8 December 2021 as observed with a
worldwide network of small telescopes. We also report new radial velocity
observations which when analyzed with a coupled model to the transits greatly
improve the planet's orbital ephemeris. Our new orbit solution reduces the
uncertainty in the transit and eclipse timing of the JWST era from tens of
minutes to a few minutes. When combined with the planned JWST observations,
this new precision may be adequate to look for non-Keplerian effects in the

underwater platforms to complete their tasks. Most navigation systems apply a
fusion between inertial sensors and other external sensors, such as global
navigation satellite systems, when available, or a Doppler velocity log. In
recent years, there has been increased interest in using multiple inertial
measurement units to improve navigation accuracy and robustness. State of the
art examples include the virtual inertial measurement unit (VIMU) and the
federated extended Kalman filter (FEKF). However, each of those approaches has
its drawbacks. The VIMU does not improve the sensor biases, which constitute a
significant source of error, especially in low-cost inertial sensors. While the
FEKF does improve accuracy, it models uncertainty propagation empirically. If
not modeled correctly, this can cause the global solution to diverge. To cope
with those shortcomings, we propose and derive a new filter structure for
multiple inertial sensors data fusion: the unified extended Kalman filter
(UEKF). In addition, to cope with the multiple equal bias variance estimation
problem we offer the bias variance redistribution algorithm. Our filter design
enables bias estimation for each of the inertial sensors in the system,
improving its accuracy and allowing the use of a varying number of inertial
sensors. We show that our UEKF performs better than other state of the art,
multiple inertial sensor filters using real data recorded during sea
experiments.

that seeks to find inputs that reach a set of target sites in a program. Most
existing directed greybox fuzzers do not provide any theoretical analysis of
their performance or optimality.
  In this paper, we introduce a complexity-theoretic framework to pose directed
greybox fuzzing as a oracle-guided search problem where some feedback about the
input space (e.g., how close an input is to the target sites) is received by
querying an oracle. Our framework assumes that each oracle query can return
arbitrary content with a large but constant amount of information. Therefore,
we use the number of oracle queries required by a fuzzing algorithm to find a
target-reaching input as the performance metric. Using our framework, we design
a randomized directed greybox fuzzing algorithm that makes a logarithmic (wrt.
the number of all possible inputs) number of queries in expectation to find a
target-reaching input. We further prove that the number of oracle queries
required by our algorithm is optimal, i.e., no fuzzing algorithm can improve
(i.e., minimize) the query count by more than a constant factor.
  We implement our approach in MC$^2$ and outperform state-of-the-art directed
greybox fuzzers on challenging benchmarks (Magma and Fuzzer Test Suite) by up

videos using only global video tags such as object class. State-of-art methods
rely on multiple independent stages, where initial spatio-temporal proposals
are generated using visual and motion cues, then prominent objects are
identified and refined. Localization is done by solving an optimization problem
over one or more videos, and video tags are typically used for video
clustering. This requires a model per-video or per-class making for costly
inference. Moreover, localized regions are not necessary discriminant because
of unsupervised motion methods like optical flow, or because video tags are
discarded from optimization. In this paper, we leverage the successful class
activation mapping (CAM) methods, designed for WSOL based on still images. A
new Temporal CAM (TCAM) method is introduced to train a discriminant deep
learning (DL) model to exploit spatio-temporal information in videos, using an
aggregation mechanism, called CAM-Temporal Max Pooling (CAM-TMP), over
consecutive CAMs. In particular, activations of regions of interest (ROIs) are
collected from CAMs produced by a pretrained CNN classifier to build pixel-wise
pseudo-labels for training the DL model. In addition, a global unsupervised
size constraint, and local constraint such as CRF are used to yield more
accurate CAMs. Inference over single independent frames allows parallel
processing of a clip of frames, and real-time localization. Extensive
experiments on two challenging YouTube-Objects datasets for unconstrained
videos, indicate that CAM methods (trained on independent frames) can yield
decent localization accuracy. Our proposed TCAM method achieves a new
state-of-art in WSVOL accuracy, and visual results suggest that it can be
adapted for subsequent tasks like visual object tracking and detection. Code is
publicly available.

appearances incrementally and maintaining accurate place recognition for
previously visited areas. Unlike humans, artificial neural networks suffer from
catastrophic forgetting and may forget the previously visited areas when
trained with new arrivals. For humans, researchers discover that there exists a
memory replay mechanism in the brain to keep the neuron active for previous
events. Inspired by this discovery, BioSLAM designs a gated generative replay
to control the robot's learning behavior based on the feedback rewards.
Specifically, BioSLAM provides a novel dual-memory mechanism for maintenance:
1) a dynamic memory to efficiently learn new observations and 2) a static
memory to balance new-old knowledge. When combined with a visual-/LiDAR- based
SLAM system, the complete processing pipeline can help the agent incrementally
update the place recognition ability, robust to the increasing complexity of
long-term place recognition. We demonstrate BioSLAM in two incremental SLAM
scenarios. In the first scenario, a LiDAR-based agent continuously travels
through a city-scale environment with a 120km trajectory and encounters
different types of 3D geometries (open streets, residential areas, commercial
buildings). We show that BioSLAM can incrementally update the agent's place
recognition ability and outperform the state-of-the-art incremental approach,
Generative Replay, by 24%. In the second scenario, a LiDAR-vision-based agent
repeatedly travels through a campus-scale area on a 4.5km trajectory. BioSLAM
can guarantee the place recognition accuracy to outperform 15\% over the
state-of-the-art approaches under different appearances. To our knowledge,
BioSLAM is the first memory-enhanced lifelong SLAM system to help incremental
place recognition in long-term navigation tasks.

understanding and mitigating the deleterious effects of decoherence. Many
quantum device platforms feature multiple decoherence mechanisms, often with a
dominant mechanism seemingly fully masking others. In this paper, we show how
access to weaker dephasing mechanisms can nevertheless be obtained for
optically active qubits by performing two-photon coincidence measurements. To
this end we theoretically investigate the impact of different decoherence
mechanisms on cooperatively emitting quantum dots. Focusing on the typically
dominant deformation-potential coupling to longitudinal acoustic phonons and
typically much less severe additional sources of pure dephasing, we employ a
numerically exact method to show that these mechanisms lead to very different
two-photon coincidence signals. Moreover, surprisingly, the impact of the
strongly coupled phonon environment is weak and leads to long-lived coherences.
We trace this back to the superohmic nature of the deformation-potential
coupling causing inter-emitter coherences to converge to a nonzero value on a
short timescale, whereas pure dephasing contributions cause a complete decay of
coherence over longer times. Our approach provides a practical means of
investigating decoherence processes on different timescales in solid state
emitters, and thus contributes to understanding and possibly eliminating their
detrimental influences.

previously identified as an unusual field object based on its strong IR excess
and variable near-IR spectrum. Multiple epochs of low-resolution (R~150)
near-IR spectra show large-amplitude (~0.1-0.5 mag) continuum variations on
timescales of days to 12 years, unlike the small-amplitude variability typical
for field ultracool dwarfs. The variations between epochs are well-modeled as
changes in the relative extinction ($\Delta{A_V}\approx2$ mag). Likewise,
Pan-STARRS optical photometry varies on timescales as long as 11 years (and
possibly as short as an hour) and implies similar amplitude $A_V$ changes.
NEOWISE mid-IR light curves also suggest changes on 6-month timescales, with
amplitudes consistent with the optical/near-IR extinction variations. However,
near-IR spectra, near-IR photometry, and optical photometry obtained in the
past year indicate the source can also be stable on hourly and monthly
timescales. From comparison to objects of similar spectral type, the total
extinction of 2MASS J0619-2903 seems to be $A_V\approx4-6$ mag, with perhaps
epochs of lower extinction. Gaia EDR3 finds that 2MASS J0619-2903 has a
wide-separation (1.2' = 10450 AU) stellar companion, with an isochronal age of
$31^{+22}_{-10}$ Myr and a mass of $0.30^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ Msun. Adopting this
companion's age and EDR3 distance (145.2$\pm$0.6 pc), we estimate a mass of
0.11-0.17 Msun for 2MASS J0619-2903. Altogether, 2MASS J0619-2903 appears to
possess an unusually long-lived primordial circumstellar disk, perhaps making
it a more obscured analog to the ""Peter Pan"" disks found around a few M dwarfs

pre-trained language models rather than train a model from scratch. However,
such models are sluggish to train and accompanied by a massive overhead.
Researchers have proposed a few lightweight alternatives such as smaller
adapters to mitigate the drawbacks. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain whether
using adapters benefits the task of summarization, in terms of improved
efficiency without an unpleasant sacrifice in performance. In this work, we
carry out multifaceted investigations on fine-tuning and adapters for
summarization tasks with varying complexity: language, domain, and task
transfer. In our experiments, fine-tuning a pre-trained language model
generally attains a better performance than using adapters; the performance gap
positively correlates with the amount of training data used. Notably, adapters
exceed fine-tuning under extremely low-resource conditions. We further provide
insights on multilinguality, model convergence, and robustness, hoping to shed
light on the pragmatic choice of fine-tuning or adapters in abstractive
summarization.

information. The buyer privately observes her risk type, which evolves
stochastically over time. A long-term contract specifies a menu of insurance
policies, contingent on the history of type reports and contractable accident
information. The optimal contract offers the consumer in each period a choice
between a perpetual complete coverage policy with fixed premium and a risky
continuation contract in which current period's accidents may affect not only
within-period consumption (partial coverage) but also future policies.
  The model allows for arbitrary restrictions to the extent to which firms can
use accident information in pricing. In the absence of pricing restrictions,
accidents as well as choices of partial coverage are used in the efficient
provision of incentives. If firms are unable to use accident history, longer
periods of partial coverage choices are rewarded, leading to menus with cheaper
full-coverage options and more attractive partial-coverage options; and
allocative inefficiency decreases along all histories.
  These results are used to study a model of perfect competition, where the
equilibrium is unique whenever it exists, as well as the monopoly problem,
where necessary and sufficient conditions for the presence of information rents
are given.

spectrometer, studied since 2015 for flying in the mid-30s on the Athena space
X-ray Observatory, a versatile observatory designed to address the Hot and
Energetic Universe science theme, selected in November 2013 by the Survey
Science Committee. Based on a large format array of Transition Edge Sensors
(TES), it aims to provide spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy, with a
spectral resolution of 2.5 eV (up to 7 keV) over an hexagonal field of view of
5 arc minutes (equivalent diameter). The X-IFU entered its System Requirement
Review (SRR) in June 2022, at about the same time when ESA called for an
overall X-IFU redesign (including the X-IFU cryostat and the cooling chain),
due to an unanticipated cost overrun of Athena. In this paper, after
illustrating the breakthrough capabilities of the X-IFU, we describe the
instrument as presented at its SRR, browsing through all the subsystems and
associated requirements. We then show the instrument budgets, with a particular
emphasis on the anticipated budgets of some of its key performance parameters.
Finally we briefly discuss on the ongoing key technology demonstration
activities, the calibration and the activities foreseen in the X-IFU Instrument
Science Center, and touch on communication and outreach activities, the
consortium organisation, and finally on the life cycle assessment of X-IFU
aiming at minimising the environmental footprint, associated with the
development of the instrument. Thanks to the studies conducted so far on X-IFU,
it is expected that along the design-to-cost exercise requested by ESA, the
X-IFU will maintain flagship capabilities in spatially resolved high resolution
X-ray spectroscopy, enabling most of the original X-IFU related scientific
objectives of the Athena mission to be retained. (abridged).

to determine source characteristics from continuous waveform data. Recent
developments in deep learning seismology have been used to improve tasks within
earthquake monitoring workflows that allow the fast and accurate detection of
up to orders of magnitude more small events than are present in conventional
catalogs. To facilitate the application of machine-learning algorithms to
large-volume seismic records, we developed a cloud-based earthquake monitoring
workflow, QuakeFlow, that applies multiple processing steps to generate
earthquake catalogs from raw seismic data. QuakeFlow uses a deep learning
model, PhaseNet, for picking P/S phases and a machine learning model, GaMMA,
for phase association with approximate earthquake location and magnitude. Each
component in QuakeFlow is containerized, allowing straightforward updates to
the pipeline with new deep learning/machine learning models, as well as the
ability to add new components, such as earthquake relocation algorithms. We
built QuakeFlow in Kubernetes to make it auto-scale for large datasets and to
make it easy to deploy on cloud platforms, which enables large-scale parallel
processing. We used QuakeFlow to process three years of continuous archived
data from Puerto Rico, and found more than a factor of ten more events that
occurred on much the same structures as previously known seismicity. We applied
Quakeflow to monitoring frequent earthquakes in Hawaii and found over an order
of magnitude more events than are in the standard catalog, including many
events that illuminate the deep structure of the magmatic system. We also added
Kafka and Spark streaming to deliver real-time earthquake monitoring results.
QuakeFlow is an effective and efficient approach both for improving realtime
earthquake monitoring and for mining archived seismic data sets.

handle nested and flat NER alike, and can better leverage noisy
self-supervision signals. A major challenge to this bi-encoder formulation for
NER lies in separating non-entity spans from entity mentions. Instead of
explicitly labeling all non-entity spans as the same class $\texttt{Outside}$
($\texttt{O}$) as in most prior methods, we introduce a novel dynamic
thresholding loss. Experiments show that our method performs well in both

introduce a new operator to generate 1-DOF mechanism topologies, furthermore,
we take many steps to speed up slow simulations of mechanisms by vectorizing
our simulations and parallelizing our simulator on a large number of threads,
which leads to a simulation 800 times faster than the simple simulation
algorithm. This is necessary given on average, 1 out of 500 candidates that are

our dataset can be used directly to find mechanisms that can trace paths very

nonlinear codes via algebraic function fields, where $q$ is a prime power. Our
codes are constructed by evaluations of rational functions at all rational
places of the algebraic function field. Compared with algebraic geometry codes,
the main difference is that we allow rational functions to be evaluated at pole

consider a sequential learning model in which rational agents arrive in order,
each acting only once, and the underlying unknown state is constantly evolving.
Each agent receives a private signal, observes all past actions of others, and
chooses an action to match the current state. Since the state changes over
time, cascades cannot last forever, and actions fluctuate too. We show that in
the long run, actions change more often than the state. This describes many
real-life faddish behaviors in which people often change their actions more
frequently than what is necessary.

observational data is highly challenging due to the combinatorial nature of the
DAG-constrained optimization problem. Recently, DAG learning has been cast as a
continuous optimization problem by characterizing the DAG constraint as a
smooth equality one, generally based on polynomials over adjacency matrices.
Existing methods place very small coefficients on high-order polynomial terms
for stabilization, since they argue that large coefficients on the higher-order
terms are harmful due to numeric exploding. On the contrary, we discover that
large coefficients on higher-order terms are beneficial for DAG learning, when
the spectral radiuses of the adjacency matrices are small, and that larger
coefficients for higher-order terms can approximate the DAG constraints much
better than the small counterparts. Based on this, we propose a novel DAG
learning method with efficient truncated matrix power iteration to approximate
geometric series based DAG constraints. Empirically, our DAG learning method
outperforms the previous state-of-the-arts in various settings, often by a
factor of $3$ or more in terms of structural Hamming distance.

study the presence of extended, low surface brightness features in galaxies and
investigate the trade-off between image depth and resolution. The individual
images were sorted by effective seeing, which allowed for optimal resolution
and optimal depth mosaics to be created with all images with seeing FWHM < 0.9""
and FWHM < 2.0"", respectively. Examining bright galaxies and their substructure
as well as accurately deblending overlapping objects requires the optimal
resolution mosaic, while detecting the faintest objects possible (to a limiting
magnitude of $m_{AB}$ ~ 29.2 mag) requires the optimal depth mosaic. The better
surface brightness sensitivity resulting from the larger LBC pixels, compared
to those of extant WFC3/UVIS and ACS/WFC cameras aboard the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) allows for unambiguous detection of both diffuse flux and very
faint tidal tails. We created azimuthally-averaged radial surface brightness
profiles for the 360 brightest galaxies in the mosaics. We find little
difference in the majority of the light profiles from the optimal resolution
and optimal depth mosaics. However, $\lesssim$ 15% of the profiles show excess
flux in the galaxy outskirts down to surface brightness levels of $\mu^{AB}_{r}
$ $\simeq$ 31 mag arcsec $^{-2}$. This is relevant to Extragalactic Background
Light (EBL) studies as diffuse light in the outer regions of galaxies are
thought to be a major contribution to the EBL. While some additional diffuse
light exists in the optimal depth profiles compared to the shallower, optimal
resolution profiles, we find that diffuse light in galaxy outskirts is a minor
contribution to the EBL overall in the r-band.

formation of electron-hole pairs (excitons) in semiconductors where the exciton
binding energy exceeds the size of the electronic band gap. At low temperature,
these ground state excitons stabilize a new phase by condensing at lower energy
than the electrons at the valence band top, thereby widening the electronic
band gap. The envisioned opportunity to explore many-boson phenomena in an
excitonic insulator system is triggering a very active debate on how ground
state excitons can be experimentally evidenced. Here, we employ a
nonequilibrium approach to spectrally disentangle the photoinduced dynamics of
an exciton condensate from the entwined signature of the valence band
electrons. By means of time-and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of
the occupied and unoccupied electronic states, we follow the complementary
dynamics of conduction and valence band electrons in the photoexcited
low-temperature phase of Ta2 NiSe5 , the hitherto most promising single-crystal
candidate to undergo a semiconductor-to-excitonic-insulator phase transition.
The photoexcited conduction electrons are found to relax within less than 1 ps.
Their relaxation time is inversely proportional to their excess energy, a
dependence that we attribute to the reduced screening of Coulomb interaction
and the low dimensionality of Ta2NiSe5 . Long after (> 10 ps) the conduction
band has emptied, the photoemission intensity below the Fermi energy has not
fully recovered the equilibrium value. Notably, this seeming carrier imbalance
cannot be rationalized simply by the relaxation of photoexcited electrons and
holes across the semiconducting band gap. [...]

observations, where the observations from each system depend on the underlying
parameter of that system. The observations are unlabeled (anonymized), in the
sense that an analyst does not know which observation came from which
stochastic system. How can the analyst estimate the underlying parameters of
the $L$ systems? Since the anonymized observations at each time are an
unordered set of L measurements (rather than a vector), classical stochastic
gradient algorithms cannot be directly used. By using symmetric polynomials, we
formulate a symmetric measurement equation that maps the observation set to a
unique vector. By exploiting that fact that the algebraic ring of
multi-variable polynomials is a unique factorization domain over the ring of
one-variable polynomials, we construct an adaptive filtering algorithm that
yields a statistically consistent estimate of the underlying parameters. We
analyze the asymptotic covariance of these estimates to quantify the effect of
anonymization. Finally, we characterize the anonymity of the observations in
terms of the error probability of the maximum aposteriori Bayesian estimator.
Using Blackwell dominance of mean preserving spreads, we construct a partial
ordering of the noise densities which relates the anonymity of the observations
to the asymptotic covariance of the adaptive filtering algorithm.

strong rhythmic and harmonic patterns that are important for music rhythmic
analysis in general. Even for human listeners, this can be a challenging task.
As a result, existing music beat tracking systems fail to deliver satisfactory
performance on singing voices. In this paper, we propose singing beat tracking
as a novel task, and propose the first approach to solving this task. Our
approach leverages semantic information of singing voices by employing
pre-trained self-supervised WavLM and DistilHuBERT speech representations as
the front-end and uses a self-attention encoder layer to predict beats. To
train and test the system, we obtain separated singing voices and their beat
annotations using source separation and beat tracking on complete songs,
followed by manual corrections. Experiments on the 741 separated vocal tracks
of the GTZAN dataset show that the proposed system outperforms several
state-of-the-art music beat tracking methods by a large margin in terms of beat
tracking accuracy. Ablation studies also confirm the advantages of pre-trained
self-supervised speech representations over generic spectral features.

large amount of data in a specific domain is labor intensive. Therefore,
existing large-scale datasets are used for pre-training. However, conventional
transfer learning and domain adaptation cannot bridge the domain gap when the
target domain differs significantly from the source domain. We propose a data
synthesis method that can solve the large domain gap problem. In this method, a
part of the target image is pasted onto the source image, and the position of
the pasted region is aligned by utilizing the information of the object
bounding box. In addition, we introduce adversarial learning to discriminate
whether the original or the pasted regions. The proposed method trains on a
large number of source images and a few target domain images. The proposed
method achieves higher accuracy than conventional methods in a very different
domain problem setting, where RGB images are the source domain, and thermal
infrared images are the target domain. Similarly, the proposed method achieves
higher accuracy in the cases of simulation images to real images.

investigation into the magnetic properties of the FTEs show a rapid decrease in
the perpendicular currents within the FTE volume exhibiting the tendency of
internal currents toward being field aligned. An assessment on the validity of
the linear force-free flux rope model for such FTEs show that the structures
drift towards a constant-$\alpha$ state but continuous reconnection inhibits
the attainment of a purely linear force-free configuration. Additionally, the
flux enclosed by the selected FTEs are computed to range between 0.3-1.5 MWb.
The FTE with the highest flux content constitutes $\sim$ 1% of the net dayside

Traditionally, image or time-series completion problems have been approached
with diffusion-based or exemplar-based methods. More recently, Deep Neural

naturally quantify uncertainty. However, the cubic scaling of GP inference and
training is a major barrier to their adoption in applications. In particular, a

challenges such as increasing training time and hurting the performance by
picking ""similar pairs with the unknown interactions"" as dissimilar pairs. In
this paper, the goal is to only use the similar set to train the models. We
point out three trivial solutions that the models converge to when they are
trained only on similar pairs: collapsed, partially collapsed, and shrinking
solutions. We propose two terms that can be added to the objective functions in
the literature to avoid these solutions. The first one is a hinge pairwise
distance loss that avoids the shrinking and collapsed solutions by keeping the
average pairwise distance of all the representations greater than a margin. The
second one is an orthogonality term that minimizes the correlation between the
dimensions of the representations and avoids the partially collapsed solution.
We conduct experiments on a variety of tasks on public and real-world datasets.

method without the assistance of any reference information. Specifically,
considering that the human visual system (HVS) is highly sensitive to structure

execute regional pre-processing which consists of keypoint resampling and local
region construction. Then, we extract three groups of quality-related features,
including: 1) geometry density features; 2) color naturalness features; 3)
angular consistency features. Both the cognitive peculiarities of the human

features that can capture the most vital aspects of distorted 3D point clouds.
Extensive experiments on several publicly available subjective point cloud

this theory to define and prove the existence of representations of
C*-correspondences on a pair of Hilbert spaces. As an application of such

  cylinder",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The wake of wavy cylinder has been shown to exhibit bistability. Depending on
the initial condition, the final state of the wake can either develop into a
steady flow (state I), or periodic shedding (state II). In this paper, we
perform direct numerical simulations to reveal the Reynolds number effects on
these two wake states. With increasing Reynolds number, the steady vortical
structures in state I wake sways back and forth in the spanwise direction,
resulting in low-frequency fluctuations in drag forces, but not in lift. For
state II, the increase in Reynolds number is associated with the emergence of
another spectral peak in the lift coefficient. The secondary frequency is
associated with highly three-dimensional vortical structures in the wake. For
both states, the wakes transition to turblent flows at higher Reynolds numbers,
with the development of small-scale vortices. We further study the streamwise
gust flows over the wavy cylinder. The time-varying inflow velocity results in
a wide range of instantaneous Reynolds number spanning from the absolutely
unstable flow regime to the bistable regime. Depending on the period of the
inflow velocity variation, the wake perturbations grown at the absolutely
unstable flow regime can be damped out in state I wake, or grow large enough to
trigger the transition state II, resulting in loss of flow control efficacy.
The above analyses reveal novel flow physics of the bistable states at
unexplored Reynolds numbers, and showcase the complex transition behavior
between the two states in unsteady flows. The insights gained from this study
improve the understanding of the wake dynamics of the wavy cylinder.

  Visual Categorization","9 pages, ACM MM 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) aims at recognizing objects from
similar subordinate categories, which is challenging and practical for human's
accurate automatic recognition needs. Most FGVC approaches focus on the
attention mechanism research for discriminative regions mining while neglecting
their interdependencies and composed holistic object structure, which are
essential for model's discriminative information localization and understanding
ability. To address the above limitations, we propose the Structure Information
Modeling Transformer (SIM-Trans) to incorporate object structure information
into transformer for enhancing discriminative representation learning to
contain both the appearance information and structure information.
Specifically, we encode the image into a sequence of patch tokens and build a
strong vision transformer framework with two well-designed modules: (i) the
structure information learning (SIL) module is proposed to mine the spatial
context relation of significant patches within the object extent with the help
of the transformer's self-attention weights, which is further injected into the
model for importing structure information; (ii) the multi-level feature
boosting (MFB) module is introduced to exploit the complementary of multi-level
features and contrastive learning among classes to enhance feature robustness
for accurate recognition. The proposed two modules are light-weighted and can
be plugged into any transformer network and trained end-to-end easily, which
only depends on the attention weights that come with the vision transformer
itself. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that the proposed
SIM-Trans achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained visual
categorization benchmarks. The code is available at

  A massive scalar propagating around the Kerr black hole induces the
far-region potential with either a trapping well or a tiny well, which produces
a peak of resonance or a bound state in the far-region. The former represents
superradiant instability, while the latter could accommodate superradiant
instability via a positive $\omega_I$. If the scalar's energy is really
quantized around a tiny well, an ultralight boson could be expressed in terms
of a hydrogen-like bound state, leading to a gravitational atom when
incorporating superradiant instability. If there are no wells outside the outer

practical use of such models in code generation and program synthesis. However,
little is known about the effects of such tools on code readability and visual
attention in practice.
  Objective: In this paper, we focus on GitHub Copilot to address the issues of
readability and visual inspection of model generated code. Readability and low
complexity are vital aspects of good source code, and visual inspection of
generated code is important in light of automation bias.
  Method: Through a human experiment (n=21) we compare model generated code to
code written completely by human programmers. We use a combination of static
code analysis and human annotators to assess code readability, and we use eye
tracking to assess the visual inspection of code.
  Results: Our results suggest that model generated code is comparable in
complexity and readability to code written by human pair programmers. At the
same time, eye tracking data suggests, to a statistically significant level,
that programmers direct less visual attention to model generated code.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight that reading code is more important than
ever, and programmers should beware of complacency and automation bias with
model generated code.

preferences via multi-turn questions and answers. The existing CRS solutions
are widely dominated by deep reinforcement learning algorithms. However, deep
reinforcement learning methods are often criticised for lacking
interpretability and requiring a large amount of training data to perform.
  In this paper, we explore a simpler alternative and propose a decision tree
based solution to CRS. The underlying challenge in CRS is that the same item
can be described differently by different users. We show that decision trees
are sufficient to characterize the interactions between users and items, and
solve the key challenges in multi-turn CRS: namely which questions to ask, how
to rank the candidate items, when to recommend, and how to handle negative
feedback on the recommendations. Firstly, the training of decision trees
enables us to find questions which effectively narrow down the search space.
Secondly, by learning embeddings for each item and tree nodes, the candidate
items can be ranked based on their similarity to the conversation context
encoded by the tree nodes. Thirdly, the diversity of items associated with each
tree node allows us to develop an early stopping strategy to decide when to
make recommendations. Fourthly, when the user rejects a recommendation, we
adaptively choose the next decision tree to improve subsequent questions and
recommendations. Extensive experiments on three publicly available benchmark
CRS datasets show that our approach provides significant improvement to the
state of the art CRS methods.

of the number of labeled samples it receives from a target distribution. They
are widely used as a measure of an algorithm's performance, but classic PAC
learning theory cannot explain their behavior.
  As observed by Antos and Lugosi (1996 , 1998), the classic `No Free Lunch'
lower bounds only trace the upper envelope above all learning curves of
specific target distributions. For a concept class with VC dimension $d$ the
classic bound decays like $d/n$, yet it is possible that the learning curve for
\emph{every} specific distribution decays exponentially. In this case, for each
$n$ there exists a different `hard' distribution requiring $d/n$ samples. Antos
and Lugosi asked which concept classes admit a `strong minimax lower bound' --
a lower bound of $d'/n$ that holds for a fixed distribution for infinitely many
$n$.
  We solve this problem in a principled manner, by introducing a combinatorial
dimension called VCL that characterizes the best $d'$ for which $d'/n$ is a
strong minimax lower bound. Our characterization strengthens the lower bounds
of Bousquet, Hanneke, Moran, van Handel, and Yehudayoff (2021), and it refines
their theory of learning curves, by showing that for classes with finite VCL
the learning rate can be decomposed into a linear component that depends only
on the hypothesis class and an exponential component that depends also on the
target distribution. As a corollary, we recover the lower bound of Antos and
Lugosi (1996 , 1998) for half-spaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  Finally, to provide another viewpoint on our work and how it compares to
traditional PAC learning bounds, we also present an alternative formulation of
our results in a language that is closer to the PAC setting.

critical information via establishing connections between entities such as
vehicles and infrastructures. During message transmission, privacy-preserving
authentication is considered as the first line of defence against attackers and
malicious information. To achieve a more secure and stable communication
environment, ever-increasing numbers of blockchain-based authentication schemes
are proposed. At first glance, existing approaches provide robust architectures
and achieve transparent authentication. However, in these schemes, verifiers
must connect to the blockchain network in advance and accomplish the
authentication with smart contracts, which prolongs the latency. To remedy this
limit, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain-based authentication
protocol(PBAG), where Root Authority(RA) generates a unique evaluation proof
corresponding to the issued certificate for each authorized vehicle. Meanwhile,
RA broadcasts a public global commitment based on all valid certificates.
Instead of querying certificates stored in the blockchain, the vehicle will be
efficiently proved to be an authorized user by utilizing the global commitment
through bilinear pairing. Moreover, our scheme can prevent vehicles equipped
with invalid certificates from accomplishing the authentication, thus avoiding
the time-consuming for checking Certificate Revocation List (CRL). Finally, our
scheme provides privacy properties such as anonymity and unlinkability. It
allows anonymous authentication based on evaluation proofs and achieves
traceability of identity in the event of a dispute. The simulation demonstrates
that the average time of verification is 0.36ms under the batch-enabled
mechanism, outperforming existing schemes by at least 63.7%.

be adequately simulated by coherent states due to their inherent diffraction in
flat space. But things will be different when it propagates on a surface with
uniform curvature called the constant Gaussian curvature surface (CGCS). By
generalizing the method of Feynman path integral, an equivalent coherent states
solution is demonstrated here to describe the beam propagation. The temporal
evolution of the Schrodinger equation is analogously translated into a spatial

identical to the squeezed state. We hope this research can give a new view on
the quantum field in curved space.

crust. A fundamental question is how the released fluid controls the
propagation dynamics and fracture geometry (depth and breadth) in three
dimensions. Analog experiments in gelatin have shown that fracture breadth
remains nearly stationary when the process in the fracture head (where breadth
is controlled) is dominated by solid toughness, whereas viscous fluid
dissipation is dominant in the fracture tail. We model propagation of the
resulting buoyant, finger-like fracture of stationary breadth with a slowly
varying opening along the crack length. The elastic response to fluid loading
in a horizontal cross-section is local and can be treated similarly to the
classical Perkins-Kern-Nordgren (PKN) model of hydraulic fracturing. The
propagation condition for a finger-like crack is based on balancing the global
energy release rate due to a unit crack extension with the rock fracture
toughness. It allows us to relate the net fluid pressure at the tip to the
fracture breadth and rock toughness. Unlike laterally propagating PKN fracture,
where breadth is known a priori, the final breadth of a finger-like vertically
ascending fracture is a result of processes in the fracture head. Because the
head is much more open than the tail, viscous pressure drop in the head can be
neglected leading to a 3D analog of Weertman hydrostatic pulse. This requires
relaxing the local elasticity assumption of the PKN model in the fracture head.
As a result, we resolve the breadth, and then match the viscosity-dominated
tail with the three dimensions, toughness-dominated head to obtain a complete
closed-form solution. We then analyze the buoyancy-driven fracture propagation
in conditions of either continuous injection or finite volume release for sets
of parameters representative of low viscosity magma diking.

Usually, these definitions both hold at low temperatures, such as liquid-helium

the Fermi energy is reduced by renormalization. In this paper, we demonstrate
that although the resistivity of CeFe$_2$Al$_{10}$ increases with decreasing

which requires the coexistence of electron and hole carriers. Our analysis of
Shubnikov--de Haas and magnetotransport data indicates that the Fermi energies
are as small as $\sim$30 K and that, despite the increasing carrier mobility
with decreasing temperature as in conventional metals, the loss of thermally
excited carriers leads to nonmetallic conduction ($\mathrm{d} \rho /

anomalous metal transforms to a more conventional metal with metallic

canonical equation of motion. The dynamics of point vortices is converted to
the Langevin equation, which results in the generalized Fokker-Planck (GFP) (or
Smolkovski) equation using the functional integral on the ansatz of the

characterized by two regimes called the ""overdamping"" and the ""underdamping""

is transformed to the two-dimensional many particle system. Several specific
applications are given of the Fokker-Planck equation. An asymptotic limit of

at the primary vertex and after FSI. The number of pions created after FSI
differs greatly from the number produced at the primary vertex due to FSI.
Because neutrino detectors can only detect final-state particles, FSI obscures
the proper information about particles created at the primary vertex. A
detailed study of FSI is required to overcome this problem, which theoretical
models incorporated in Monte Carlo (MC) neutrino event generators can provide.
They should give theoretical results concerning the neutrino interactions for
various researches, acting as a connection among both theoretical models and
experimental data. In this paper, we provide simulated events for the pion
creation in {\nu} {\mu} charge current (CC) interactions on a 40 Ar target in
the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) setup for two distinct MC
generators: GENIE and NuWro. In comparison to GENIE (v-3.00.06), NuWro
(v-19.02.2) is more opaque (less responsive) to the charge exchange and
absorption processes; pions are more likely to be absorbed than produced during
the intranuclear transport.

images in real-time. With the rise of cloud computing, retrieval tasks are
usually outsourced to cloud servers. However, the cloud scenario brings a
daunting challenge of privacy protection as cloud servers cannot be fully
trusted. To this end, image-encryption-based privacy-preserving image retrieval
schemes have been developed, which first extract features from cipher-images,
and then build retrieval models based on these features. Yet, most existing
approaches extract shallow features and design trivial retrieval models,
resulting in insufficient expressiveness for the cipher-images. In this paper,
we propose a novel paradigm named Encrypted Vision Transformer (EViT), which
advances the discriminative representations capability of cipher-images. First,
in order to capture comprehensive ruled information, we extract multi-level
local length sequence and global Huffman-code frequency features from the
cipher-images which are encrypted by stream cipher during JPEG compression
process. Second, we design the Vision Transformer-based retrieval model to
couple with the multi-level features, and propose two adaptive data
augmentation methods to improve representation power of the retrieval model.
Our proposal can be easily adapted to unsupervised and supervised settings via
self-supervised contrastive learning manner. Extensive experiments reveal that
EViT achieves both excellent encryption and retrieval performance,
outperforming current schemes in terms of retrieval accuracy by large margins
while protecting image privacy effectively. Code is publicly available at

shower array KASCADE-Grande in Karlsruhe, Germany. The last configuration of
LOPES was called LOPES 3D and consisted of ten tripole antennas. Each of these
antennas consisted of three crossed dipoles east-west, north-south, and
vertically aligned. With this, LOPES 3D had the unique possibility to study the
benefits of measurements with vertically aligned antennas in the environment of
the well understood and calibrated particle detector array KASCADE-Grande. The
measurements with three spatially coincident antennas allows a redundant
reconstruction of the electric field vector. Several methods to exploit the
redundancy were developed and tested. Furthermore, for the first time in LOPES,
the background noise could be studied polarization- and direction dependent.
With LOPES 3D it could be demonstrated that radio detection reaches a higher
efficiency for inclined showers when including measurements with vertically
aligned antennas and that the vertical component gets more important for the
measurement of inclined showers. In this contribution we discuss a weighting
scheme for the best combination of three redundant reconstructed electric field
vectors. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of these weighting schemes on
the ability to reconstruct air showers using the radio method. We show an
estimate of the radio efficiency for inclined showers with focus on the
benefits of measurements with vertically aligned antennas and we present the
direction dependent noise in the different polarizations.

four-dimensional Einstein-scalar gravity, implying that more general solutions
with independent scalar charges can have naked singularities. Since singular
branes are also of interest as tentative classical counterparts of unstable
tachyonic branes and/or brane-antibrane systems, it is worth investigating
branes with independent scalar charges in more detail. Here we study singular
branes associated with the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution of
four-dimensional gravity. In the case of codimension three, we also construct
singular branes endowed with a Zipoy-Voorhees-type oblateness parameter. It is
expected that such branes will not be supersymmetric in the string theory. We
demonstrate this in the special case of NS5-branes of type II theory. We

were analyzed. Combining both mapping aids compared to one aid resulted in
higher performance. While highlights were more helpful for implementing the
quadcopter missions, dynamic linking improved learning outcomes on the

related to higher coding correctness and higher learning outcomes. Based on
process data, users in the group with both aids had a higher chance of avoiding

are difficult to achieve both these goals, especially when the table splitting
lines are blurred or tilted. In this paper, we propose an accurate and
end-to-end transformer-based table structure recognition method, referred to as
TRUST. Transformers are suitable for table structure recognition because of
their global computations, perfect memory, and parallel computation. By
introducing novel Transformer-based Query-based Splitting Module and
Vertex-based Merging Module, the table structure recognition problem is
decoupled into two joint optimization sub-tasks: multi-oriented table
row/column splitting and table grid merging. The Query-based Splitting Module
learns strong context information from long dependencies via Transformer
networks, accurately predicts the multi-oriented table row/column separators,
and obtains the basic grids of the table accordingly. The Vertex-based Merging
Module is capable of aggregating local contextual information between adjacent
basic grids, providing the ability to merge basic girds that belong to the same
spanning cell accurately. We conduct experiments on several popular benchmarks
including PubTabNet and SynthTable, our method achieves new state-of-the-art
results. In particular, TRUST runs at 10 FPS on PubTabNet, surpassing the
previous methods by a large margin.

interlinked data, the architecture of the Semantic Web today relies mostly on
the data providers to maintain access to their data through SPARQL endpoints.
Several studies, however, have shown that such endpoints often experience
downtime, meaning that the data they maintain becomes inaccessible. While
decentralized systems based on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology have previously
shown to increase the availability of knowledge graphs, even when a large

expensive task since data necessary to answer a single query might be
distributed over multiple nodes. In this paper, we therefore propose an
approach to optimizing SPARQL queries over decentralized knowledge graphs,
called Lothbrok. While there are potentially many aspects to consider when
optimizing such queries, we focus on three aspects: cardinality estimation,
locality awareness, and data fragmentation. We empirically show that Lothbrok
is able to achieve significantly faster query processing performance compared
to the state of the art when processing challenging queries as well as when the
network is under high load.

stress- and strain-softening at finite strains. The model is based on the
construction of a convex hull replacing the originally non-convex incremental
stress potential which in turn represents damage in terms of the classical
$(1-D)$ approach. This convex hull is given as the linear convex combination of
weakly and strongly damaged phases and thus, it represents the homogenization
of a microstructure bifurcated in the two phases. As a result thereof, damage
evolves in the convexified regime mainly by an increasing volume fraction of
the strongly damaged phase. In contrast to previous relaxed incremental
formulations in G\""urses and Miehe [16] and Balzani and Ortiz [2], where the
convex hull has been kept fixated after construction, here, the strongly
damaged phase is allowed to elastically unload upon further loading. At the
same time, its volume fraction increases nonlinearly within the convexified
regime. Thus, strain-softening in the sense of a decreasing stress with
increasing strain can be modeled. The major advantage of the proposed approach
is that it ensures mesh-independent structural simulations without the
requirement of additional length-scale related parameters or nonlocal
quantities, which simplifies an implementation using classical material
subroutine interfaces. In this paper, focus is on the relaxation of
one-dimensional models for fiber damage which are combined with a microsphere
approach to allow for the description of three-dimensional fiber dispersions
appearing in fibrous materials such as soft biological tissues. Several
numerical examples are analyzed to show the overall response of the model and
the mesh-independence of resulting structural calculations.

for estimating an upper uncertainty bound that can be used to define an
acquisition function to determine the next query to the agents. This enables
the mechanism to properly explore (and not just exploit) the bundle space
during its preference elicitation phase. We run computational experiments in

radiative transfer needs to be solved implicitly because of the fast
propagation speed of photons relative to the fluid velocity. The M1 model is
hyperbolic and can be discretized with an HLL solver, whose time implicit
integration can be done using a nonlinear Jacobi method. One can show that this
iterative method always preserves the admissible states, such as positive
radiative energy and reduced flux less than 1. To decrease the number of
iterations required for the solver to converge, and therefore to decrease the
computational cost, we propose a geometric multigrid algorithm. Unfortunately,
this method is not able to preserve the admissible states. In order to preserve
the admissible state states, we introduce a pseudo-time such that the solution
of the problem on the coarse grid is the steady state of a differential
equation in pseudo-time. We present preliminary results showing the decrease of
the number of iterations and computational cost as a function of the number of

single-channel. The first design is a Bi-directional Fusion Projection (BFP)
module, where we consider both the color characteristics of raw images and
spatial structure of single-channel. The second one is that we propose a
Locally Multiplicative Self-Attention (L-MSA) scheme to effectively deliver
information from the local space to relevant parts. ELMformer can efficiently
reduce the computational consumption and perform well on raw image restoration
tasks. Enhanced by these two core designs, ELMformer achieves the highest
performance and keeps the lowest FLOPs on raw denoising and raw deblurring
benchmarks compared with state-of-the-arts. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and generalization ability of ELMformer. On SIDD benchmark, our
method has even better denoising performance than ISP-based methods which need
huge amount of additional sRGB training images. The codes are release at
https://github.com/leonmakise/ELMformer.

combine high speed and minimal reagent consumption. To date, this type of
droplet mixing is driven by a volume force resulting from the absorption of
high-frequency acoustic waves in the bulk of the fluid. Here, we show that the
speed of these sensors is limited by the slow advection of analyte to the
sensor surface due to the formation of a hydrodynamic boundary layer. We
eliminate this hydrodynamic boundary layer by using much lower ultrasonic
frequencies to excite the droplet, which drives a Rayleigh streaming that
behaves essentially like a slip velocity. Three-dimensional simulations show
that this provides a threefold speedup compared to Eckart streaming.
Experimentally, we shorten a SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassay from 20 min to 40

assumption that low-frequency information is more domain-invariant while the
high-frequency information contains domain-related information. Hence, we
introduce an approach, named low-frequency module (LFM), to extract
domain-invariant feature representations. The LFM is constructed with the
digital Gaussian low-pass filter. Our method is easy to implement and
introduces no extra hyperparameter. We design two effective ways to utilize the
LFM for domain adaptation, and our method is complementary to other existing
methods and formulated as a plug-and-play unit that can be combined with these

state-of-the-art methods for various computer vision tasks, including image

Let $G$ and $H$ be two disjoint graphs. The graph $G[H]$ is obtained by the

online reinforcement learning does not guarantee closed loop stability unless

assume only partial knowledge of the system model. To achieve the claimed
results, we employ techniques of classical adaptive control. The implementation

is, on a DNA molecule. A double stranded DNA molecule contains two strands,
each having a 5' and a 3' end, and these two strands together form the molecule
with the following properties. The strands have the same length, their 5' to 3'
directions are opposite, and in each position, the two strands have nucleotides
that are complement of each other (by the Watson-Crick complementary relation).
Consequently, WK automata have two reading heads, one for each strand. In
traditional WK automata both heads read the whole input in the same physical
direction, but in 5'->3' WK automata the heads start from the two extremes and
read the input in opposite direction. In sensing 5'->3' WK automata, the
process on the input is finished when the heads meet, and the model is capable
to accept the class of linear context-free languages. Deterministic variants
are weaker, the class named 2detLIN, a proper subclass of linear languages is
accepted by them. Recently, another specific variants, the state-deterministic
sensing 5'->3' WK automata are investigated in which the graph of the automaton
has the special property that for each node of the graph, all out edges (if
any) go to a sole node, i.e., for each state there is (at most) one state that
can be reached by a direct transition. It was shown that this concept is
somewhat orthogonal to the usual concept of determinism in case of sensing
5'->3' WK automata. In this paper a new concept, the quasi-determinism is
investigated, that is in each configuration of a computation (if it is not
finished yet), the next state is uniquely determined although the next
configuration may not be, in case various transitions are enabled at the same
time. We show that this new concept is a common generalisation of the usual
determinism and the state-determinism, i.e., the class of quasi-deterministic
sensing 5'->3' WK automata is a superclass of both of the mentioned other
classes. There are various usual restrictions on WK automata, e.g., stateless
or 1-limited variants. We also prove some hierarchy results among language
classes accepted by various subclasses of quasi-deterministic sensing 5'->3' WK
automata and also some other already known language classes.

Nova Sct 2019 began displaying a series of nine large amplitude flares (up to
Delta(m)~1.7 mag), characterized by a rapid rise to peak (=<10 hours) and a
fast exponential decline (e-folding time =<50 hours). The time interval
Delta(t) between flares follows an ordered sequence, declining from 8.43 to
4.90 days, that safely allows to exclude that any other flare occured without
being recorded by the observations. When the sequence of flares was over by
2020 July 28 (day +271), Nova Sct 2019 slowed its overall decline rate from
Delta(m)=0.0067 mag/day to 0.0027 mag/day. The flares were caused by material
expelled at high velocity (~1000 km/s) from the still burning WD. The cooler
pseudo-photosphere forming at each flare in the expelled material, resulted in
a recombination wave to spread through the original nova ejecta (at ~170 AU
from the WD), quenching emission from [FeX] and [FeVII] and boosting that from
lower ionization species. After each flare, once the small amount of expelled
material had turned optically thin, the original nova ejecta resumed displaying
[FeX] and [FeVII] emission lines, a fact that clearly proves the direct
photo-ionization action exerted on the ejecta by the burning WD. While the
other known flaring novae (V458 Vul, V4745 Sgr, and V5588 Sgr) presented the
flares close to maximum brightness and with increasing Delta(t), Nova Sct 2019
is unique in having displayed them during the advanced nebular stage and with

  Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stac2470",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supra-arcade downflows (SADs) are dark structures descending towards
post-reconnection flare loops observed in extreme ultraviolet or X-ray
observations and are closely related to magnetic reconnection during solar
flares. Due to the lack of statistical study on SADs in a single flare,
evolutions of kinematic and thermal properties of SADs during the flare process
still remain obscure. In this work, we identified 81 SADs in a flare that
occurred on 2013 May 22 using observations of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The kinematic properties of each
SAD, including the appearance time, height, projective velocity, and
acceleration were recorded. We found that the appearance heights of SADs become
larger during the flare, which is likely due to the lift of the bottom of the
plasma sheet. In the flare decay phase, the region where SADs mainly appear
moves from the north part to the south side possibly related to a secondary
eruption in the south side. The trajectories of most SADs can be fitted by one
or two deceleration processes, while some special ones have positive
accelerations during the descent. For the thermal properties, we selected 54
SADs, whose front and body could be clearly distinguished from the surrounding
during the entire descent, to perform Differential Emission Measure analysis.
It is revealed that the temperatures of the SAD front and body tend to increase
during their downward courses, and the relationship between the density and
temperature indicates that the heating is mainly caused by adiabatic
compression.

perspectives without troublesome 2D instance tracking, recent methods tend to
aggregate multiview feature by sampling regular 3D grid densely in space, which

aggregation by proposing a learnable keypoints sampling method, which scatters
pseudo surface points in 3D space, in order to keep data sparsity. The
scattered points augmented by multi-view geometric constraints and visual
features are then employed to infer objects location and shape in the scene. To
make up the limitations of single frame and model multi-view geometry
explicitly, we further propose a surface filter module for noise suppression.
Experimental results show that our method achieves significantly better

hindsight experience replay (HER) generates successful experiences from
unsuccessful experiences. However, generating successful experiences without
consideration of the property of achieved goals is less efficient. In this
paper, a novel cluster-based sampling strategy exploiting the property of
achieved goals is proposed. The proposed sampling strategy groups episodes with
different achieved goals and samples experiences in the manner of HER. For the
grouping, K-means clustering algorithm is used. The centroids of the clusters
are obtained from the distribution of failed goals defined as the original
goals not achieved. The proposed method is validated by experiments with three
robotic control tasks of the OpenAI Gym. The results of experiments demonstrate
that the proposed method significantly reduces the number of epochs required

  Design: This retrospective study evaluated the performance of 11 clinicians
for detecting lung cancer from chest radiographs, with and without assistance
from a commercially available AI algorithm (red dot, Behold.ai) that predicts
suspected lung cancer from CXRs. Clinician performance was evaluated against
clinically confirmed diagnoses.
  Setting: The study analysed anonymised patient data from an NHS hospital; the
dataset consisted of 400 chest radiographs from adult patients (18 years and
above) who had a CXR performed in 2020, with corresponding clinical text
reports.
  Participants: A panel of readers consisting of 11 clinicians (consultant

  Main outcome measures: Overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and
precision for detecting lung cancer on CXRs by clinicians, with and without AI

were also evaluated, with and without AI input.
  Results: The use of the AI algorithm by clinicians led to an improved overall
performance for lung tumour detection, achieving an overall increase of 17.4%
of lung cancers being identified on CXRs which would have otherwise been
missed, an overall increase in detection of smaller tumours, a 24% and 13%

fuzzball microstate. The stretched horizon provides a cut-off, and therefore
one can determine the normal (as opposed to quasi-normal) modes of a probe
scalar in this geometry. For the BTZ black hole, we compute these as a function
of the level $n$ and the angular quantum number $J$. Conventional level
repulsion is absent in this system, and yet we find that the Spectral Form
Factor (SFF) shows clear evidence for a dip-ramp-plateau structure with a
linear ramp of slope $\sim 1$ on a log-log plot, with or without ensemble
averaging. We show that this is a robust feature of stretched horizons by
repeating our calculations on the Rindler wedge (times a compact space). We
also observe that this is {\em not} a generic feature of integrable systems, as
illustrated by standard examples like integrable billiards and random 2-site
coupled SYK model, among others. The origins of the ramp can be traced to the
hierarchically weaker dependence of the normal mode spectrum on the quantum
numbers of the compact directions, and the resulting quasi-degeneracy. We
conclude by noting an analogy between the 4-site coupled SYK model and the
quartic coupling responsible for the non-linear instability of capped
geometries. Based on this, we speculate that incorporating probe
self-interactions will lead to stronger connections to random matrix behavior.

gravity waves (IGWs) that are stochastically excited in the radiative interiors
of solar-type stars. Late F-type stars have relatively thin convective
envelopes with fast convective flows and tend to be fast rotators compared to
solar-type stars of later spectral types. These two elements are expected to
directly impact the IGW excitation rates and properties. We want to estimate
the amplitude of stochastically excited gravity modes (g-modes) in F-type stars
for different rotational regimes. We used the ASH code to perform 3D
simulations of deep-shell models of 1.3 $M_\odot$ F-type solar-type stars,
including the radiative interior and the shallow convective envelope. The IGWs
are excited by interface interactions between convective plumes and the top of
the radiative interior. We were able to characterise the IGWs and g-mode
properties in the radiative interior, and we compared these properties using
the computation from the 1D oscillation code GYRE. The amplitude of
low-frequency modes is significantly higher in fast-rotating models and the
evolution of the period spacing of consecutive modes exhibits evidence of a
behaviour that is modified by the influence of the Coriolis force. For our
fastest rotating model, we were able to detect the intermediate degree g-mode
signature near the top of the simulation domain. Nevertheless, the predicted
luminosity perturbations from individual modes still remain at small
amplitudes. We obtained mode amplitudes that are several orders of magnitude
higher than those of prior 3D simulations of solar models. Our simulations
suggest that g-mode signatures could be detectable in late F-type stars.

paramount importance at a global level. A natural and powerful dynamical
modeling framework to use in this context is a continuous time Markov decision
process (CTMDP) that encompasses classical compartmental paradigms such as the
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. The challenges with CTMDP based
models motivate the need for a more efficient approach and the mean field
approach offers an effective alternative. The mean field approach computes the
collective behavior of a dynamical system comprising numerous interacting nodes
(where nodes represent individuals in the population). This paper (a) presents
an overview of the mean field approach to epidemic modeling and control and (b)
provides a state-of-the-art update on recent advances on this topic. Our
discussion in this paper proceeds along two specific threads. The first thread
assumes that the individual nodes faithfully follow a socially optimal control
policy prescribed by a regulatory authority. The second thread allows the
individual nodes to exhibit independent, strategic behavior. In this case, the
strategic interaction is modeled as a mean field game and the control is based
on the associated mean field Nash equilibria. In this paper, we start with a
discussion of modeling of epidemics using an extended compartmental model -
SIVR and provide an illustrative example. We next provide a review of relevant
literature, using a mean field approach, on optimal control of epidemics,
dealing with how a regulatory authority may optimally contain epidemic spread
in a population. Following this, we provide an update on the literature on the
use of the mean field game based approach in the study of epidemic spread and
control. We conclude the paper with relevant future research directions.

ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy to characterize the dynamics of hot

sharing platforms (e.g., YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, and Twitch), User-Generated
Content (UGC) videos have become increasingly common and now account for a
large portion of multimedia traffic on the internet. Unlike professionally
generated videos produced by filmmakers and videographers, typically, UGC
videos contain multiple authentic distortions, generally introduced during
capture and processing by naive users. Quality prediction of UGC videos is of
paramount importance to optimize and monitor their processing in hosting
platforms, such as their coding, transcoding, and streaming. However, blind
quality prediction of UGC is quite challenging because the degradations of UGC
videos are unknown and very diverse, in addition to the unavailability of
pristine reference. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an accurate and
efficient Blind Video Quality Assessment (BVQA) model for UGC videos, which we
name 2BiVQA for double Bi-LSTM Video Quality Assessment. 2BiVQA metric consists
of three main blocks, including a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) to extract discriminative features from image patches, which are then fed
into two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for spatial and temporal pooling.
Specifically, we use two Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)
networks, the first is used to capture short-range dependencies between image
patches, while the second allows capturing long-range dependencies between
frames to account for the temporal memory effect. Experimental results on
recent large-scale UGC video quality datasets show that 2BiVQA achieves high
performance at a lower computational cost than state-of-the-art models. The

years demonstrates that the barium-contaminated companion is a rapid rotator
with temporal variability due to spots. The amplitude and phasing of the
photometric variability changes abruptly, however there is no evidence for a
change in the rotation period (P = 2.06~d) over the course of the observations.
The co-addition of 17 high-resolution spectra obtained with VLT-UVES allow us
to measure the physical and chemical properties of the companion, confirming it
to be a chromospherically-active, late G-type sub-giant with more than +1~dex
of barium enhancement. We find no evidence of radial velocity variability in
the spectra, obtained over the course of approximately 130~d with a single
additional point some 8 years later, with the radial velocities of all epochs
approximately $-$10 \kms{} from the previously measured systemic velocity of
the nebula. This is perhaps indicative that the binary has a relatively long
period (P $\gtrsim$ 2~yr) and high eccentricity ($e\gtrsim$ 0.3), and that all
the observations were taken around radial velocity minimum. However, unless the
binary orbital plane is not aligned with the waist of the nebula or the
systemic velocity of the binary is not equal to the literature value for the
nebula, this would imply an unfeasibly large mass for the nebular progenitor.

Towards this, we investigated an effective way for mixing of non-Newtonian

non-Newtonian fluid is modelled using the power law model with varying fluid
rheology from shear thickening to shear thinning. For enhancing the mixing,
pulsed velocity inlet condition is applied with varying phase angle and
frequency and compared with constant velocity inlet condition. We demonstrated
enhanced mixing using pulsing velocity inlet condition and achieved a maximum
mixing of 97.6% using pulsed input velocity with a phase difference of
180{\deg} and considering a frequency of 5 Hz for the case of shear-thinning
fluid (n=0.6). For the same condition, the mixing index is 89.1% and 85.2% for
Newtonian and shear thickening fluid (n=1.4), respectively. The present study
will be helpful in designing micromixers for mixing non-Newtonian fluid

for a sample of $i<25$ AB mag galaxies. We find that with available $i$-band
fluxes, $r$, $u$, IRAC/$ch2$ and $z$ bands provide most of the information
regarding the redshift with importance decreasing from $r$-band to $z$-band. We
also find that for the same sample, IRAC/$ch2$, $Y$, $r$ and $u$ bands are the
most relevant bands in stellar mass measurements with decreasing order of
importance. Investigating the inter-correlation between the bands, we train a
model to predict UVISTA observations in near-IR from H20-like observations. We
find that magnitudes in $YJH$ bands can be simulated/predicted with an accuracy
of $1\sigma$ mag scatter $\lesssim 0.2$ for galaxies brighter than 24 AB mag in
near-IR bands. One should note that these conclusions depend on the selection
criteria of the sample. For any new sample of galaxies with a different
selection, these results should be remeasured. Our results suggest that in the
presence of a limited number of bands, a machine learning model trained over
the population of observed galaxies with extensive spectral coverage
outperforms template-fitting. Such a machine learning model maximally comprises

the state-of-the-art solutions for imaging inverse problems. However, for
high-dimensional imaging tasks, especially X-ray CT and MRI imaging, the deep
unrolling schemes typically become inefficient both in terms of memory and
computation, due to the need of computing multiple times the high-dimensional
forward and adjoint operators. Recently researchers have found that such
limitations can be partially addressed by unrolling the stochastic gradient
descent (SGD), inspired by the success of stochastic first-order optimization.
In this work, we explore further this direction and propose first a more
expressive and practical stochastic primal-dual unrolling, based on the
state-of-the-art Learned Primal-Dual (LPD) network, and also a further
acceleration upon stochastic primal-dual unrolling, using sketching techniques
to approximate products in the high-dimensional image space. The operator
sketching can be jointly applied with stochastic unrolling for the best
acceleration and compression performance. Our numerical experiments on X-ray CT

peak luminosity is determined to be $(1.11\pm0.06)\times 10^{39}\, \rm erg\
s^{-1}$; it is thus a {\it bonda fide} pulsating ultraluminous X-ray source
(PULX). Owing to the broad energy band of \textit{Insight}-HXMT, its pulsed
X-ray emission was detected from 1 keV up to the 130$-$180 keV band, which is
the highest energy emission detected from any PULXs outside the Milky Way. This
allows us to conclude that its main pulsed X-ray emission is from the ""fan
beam"" of the accretion column, and its luminosity is thus intrinsic. We also
estimate its magnetic field of (4.8$-$8.6)$\times10^{12}$ G or
(1.7$-$2.2)$\times10^{13}$ G, from its spin evolution or transition in the
accretion column structure during the outburst; we suggest that the two values

reads with homopolymer errors. The main novelty in our work is that we resort
to run-length compression to help deal with errors. Our method receives as
input a run-length-encoded string collection containing the HiFi reads along
with their reverse complements. Subsequently, it splits the encoding into two
arrays, one storing the sequence of symbols for equal-symbol runs and another
storing the run lengths. The purpose of the split is to get the BWT of the run
symbols and reorder their lengths accordingly. We show that this special BWT,
as it encodes the HiFi reads and their reverse complements, supports
bi-directional queries for the HiFi reads. Then, we propose a variation of the
MEM algorithm of Belazzougui et al. (2013) that exploits the run-length
encoding and the implicit bi-directional property of our BWT to compute
approximate MEMs. Concretely, if the algorithm finds that two substrings, $a_1
\ldots a_p$ and $b_1 \ldots b_p$, have a MEM, then it reports the MEM only if
their corresponding length sequences, $\ell^{a}_1 \ldots \ell^{a}_p$ and
$\ell^{b}_1 \ldots \ell^{b}_p$, do not differ beyond an input threshold. We use
a simple metric to calculate the similarity of the length sequences that we
call the {\em run-length excess}. Our technique facilitates the detection of
MEMs with homopolymer errors as it does not require dynamic programming to find
approximate matches where the only edits are the lengths of the equal-symbol
runs. Finally, we present a method that relies on a geometric data structure to
report the text occurrences of the MEMs detected by our algorithm.

govern $K^*(892)^0$ kinematics. Hydrodynamics breaks down at the Knudsen number

This paper explores new modules to simultaneously learn local-global features

effective 3OD network via simultaneous local-global feature learning (dubbed

Dynamic Points Interaction (DPI) module that preserves effective local features
during pooling. Besides, DPI is detachable and can be incorporated into
existing 3OD networks to boost their performance. Second, it develops a Global
Context Aggregation module to aggregate multi-scale features from different

improvements over thirteen competitors in terms of detection accuracy and

where each oriented edge is endowed with a unit modulus complex number which is
simply conjugated under orientation flip. A natural replacement for the
combinatorial Laplacian is then the so-called magnetic Laplacian, an Hermitian
matrix that includes information about the graph's connection. Connection
graphs and magnetic Laplacians appear, e.g., in the problem of angular
synchronization. In the context of large and dense graphs, we study here
sparsifiers of the magnetic Laplacian, i.e., spectral approximations based on
subgraphs with few edges. Our approach relies on sampling multi-type spanning
forests (MTSFs) using a custom determinantal point process, a distribution over
edges that favours diversity. In a word, an MTSF is a spanning subgraph whose
connected components are either trees or cycle-rooted trees. The latter
partially capture the angular inconsistencies of the connection graph, and thus
provide a way to compress information contained in the connection.
Interestingly, when this connection graph has weakly inconsistent cycles,
samples of this distribution can be obtained by using a random walk with cycle
popping. We provide statistical guarantees for a choice of natural estimators
of the connection Laplacian, and investigate the practical application of our
sparsifiers in two applications.

relation obeyed by the mass and width differences of the two meson mass
eigenstates. We solve for the parameters $x$ and $y$, proportional to the mass
and width differences in the charm mixing, respectively, taking the box-diagram
contributions to $x(s)$ and $y(s)$ at large mass squared $s$ of a fictitious
$D$ meson as inputs. The SU(3) symmetry breaking is introduced through physical
thresholds of different $D$ meson decay channels for $y(s)$. These
threshold-dependent effects, acting like nonperturbative power corrections in
QCD sum rules, stabilize the solutions of $y(s=m_D^2)$ with the $D$ meson mass
$m_D$. We then calculate $x(s)$ through the dispersive integration of $y(s)$,
and show that our predictions $x(m_D^2)\approx 0.21\%$ and $y(m_D^2)\approx
0.52\%$ are close to the data in both $CP$-conserving and $CP$-violating cases.
It is observed that the channel containing di-kaon states provides the major
source of SU(3) breaking, which enhances $x(m_D^2)$ and $y(m_D^2)$ by four
orders of magnitude relative to the perturbative results. We also predict the
coefficient ratio $q/p$ involved in the charm mixing with $|q/p|-1\approx
2\times 10^{-4}$ and $Arg(q/p)\approx 6\times 10^{-3}$ degrees, which can be
scrutinized by precise future measurements. The formalism is extended to
studies of the $B_{s(d)}$ meson mixing and the kaon mixing, and the small
deviations of the obtained width differences from the perturbative inputs
explain why the above mixing can be understood via short-distance dynamics. We
claim that the puzzling charm mixing is attributed to the strong
Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani suppression on perturbative contributions, instead of
to breakdown of the quark-hadron duality, which occurs only at 15\% level.

flakiness-free. Recently, the research community has been pushing forward the
detection of flaky tests by suggesting many static and dynamic approaches.
While promising, those approaches mainly focus on classifying tests as flaky or
not and, even when high performances are reported, it remains challenging to
understand the cause of flakiness. This part is crucial for researchers and
developers that aim to fix it. To help with the comprehension of a given flaky
test, we propose FlakyCat, the first approach for classifying flaky tests based

evaluation shows that FlakyCat categorises flaky tests accurately, with a
weighted F1 score of 70%. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of our
approach for each category, revealing that Async waits, Unordered collections
and Time-related flaky tests are accurately classified, while
Concurrency-related flaky tests are more challenging to predict. Finally, to
facilitate the comprehension of FlakyCat's predictions, we present a new
technique for CodeBERT-based model interpretability that highlights code

vital for numerous MIR tasks such as musicological analysis, key detection, or
music segmentation. However, automatic cadence detection remains challenging
mainly because it involves a combination of high-level musical elements like
harmony, voice leading, and rhythm. In this work, we present a graph
representation of symbolic scores as an intermediate means to solve the cadence
detection task. We approach cadence detection as an imbalanced node
classification problem using a Graph Convolutional Network. We obtain results
that are roughly on par with the state of the art, and we present a model
capable of making predictions at multiple levels of granularity, from
individual notes to beats, thanks to the fine-grained, note-by-note
representation. Moreover, our experiments suggest that graph convolution can
learn non-local features that assist in cadence detection, freeing us from the
need of having to devise specialized features that encode non-local context. We
argue that this general approach to modeling musical scores and classification
tasks has a number of potential advantages, beyond the specific recognition

integration has the lowest predictive performance. Overall, architectures that
integrate triplet loss achieved the best results. Statistical differences can,

Red and Blue leads to more combat effectiveness for either side. From Green's
perspective, if either Red or Blue exceed a size according to the capacity of
the local population to facilitate or tolerate, then support for that side
diminishes; the corresponding Green population reverts to the neutral
sub-population, who do not contribute to combat effectiveness of either side.
The mechanism for supporters deciding if either Blue or Red are too big is
given by a logistic-type interaction term. The intent of the model is to
examine the role of influence in complex adversarial situations typical in

interesting feature is that, although both the amount of entanglement harvested

medium. Being able to detect and characterize them is the first step toward
understanding their origin, their evolution, and their role in the Galactic
cycle of matter. Aims. We present a new method, called FilDReaMS, to detect and
analyze filaments in a given image. This method is meant to be fast,
user-friendly, multi-scale, and suited for statistical studies. Methods. The
input image is scanned with a rectangular model bar, which makes it possible to
uncover structures that can be locally approximated by this bar and to derive
their orientations. The bar width can be varied over a broad range of values to
probe filaments of different widths. Results. We performed several series of
tests to validate the method and to assess its sensitivity to the level of
noise, the filament aspect ratios, and the dynamic range of filament
intensities. We found that the method exhibits very good performance at
recovering the orientation of the filamentary structures, with an accuracy of
0.5{\deg} in nominal conditions, up to 3{\deg} in the worst case scenario with
high level of noise. The filaments width is recovered with uncertainties better
than 0.5 px (pixels) in most of the cases, which could extend up to 3 px in
case of low signal-to-noise ratios. Some attempt to build a correspondence
between Plummer-type filament profiles and outcomes of the method is proposed,
but remains sensitive to the local environment. Conclusions. Our method is
found to be robust and adapted to the identification and the reconstruction of
filamentary structures in various environments, from diffuse to dense medium.
It allows us to explore the hierarchical scales of these filamentary structures
with a high reliability, especially when dealing with their orientation.

spatial light modulator to recover intensity targets after scattering media,

to find the best phase map. To demonstrate the proposed method's high
performance, experimental tests have been carried out. High fidelity is

for the setting of CMAB with probabilistically triggered arms (CMAB-T), we
discover a novel (directional) triggering probability and variance modulated

various applications, such as cascading bandits, online network exploration and
online influence maximization. Under this new condition, we propose a BCUCB-T

TPVM condition and completely removes the dependency on $K$ in the leading
regret. As a valuable by-product, the regret analysis used in this paper can
improve several existing results by a factor of $O(\log K)$. Finally,

adaptive optics (XAO) system, to be proposed as a visitor instrument on ESO
VLT. The main science goal of RISTRETTO is the detection and atmospheric
characterization of exoplanets in reflected light, in particular the temperate
rocky planet Proxima b. RISTRETTO will be able to measure albedos and detect
atmospheric features in a number of exoplanets orbiting nearby stars for the
first time. It will do so by combining a high-contrast AO system working at the
diffraction limit of the telescope to a high-resolution spectrograph, via a
7-spaxel integral-field unit (IFU) feeding single-mode fibers. Further science
cases for RISTRETTO include the study of accreting protoplanets such as PDS 70
b & c through spectrally-resolved H-alpha emission; and spatially-resolved
studies of Solar System objects such as icy moons and the ice giants Uranus and
Neptune. The project is in an advanced design phase for the spectrograph and
IFU/fiber-link sub-systems, and a preliminary design phase for the AO
front-end. Construction of the spectrograph and IFU/fiber-link will start at
the end of 2022. RISTRETTO is a pathfinder instrument in view of similar
developments at ESO ELT, in particular the SCAO-IFU mode of ELT-ANDES and the
future ELT-PCS instrument.

Our approach performs NAS to find quantization-friendly SR models. The search

the formation and evolution of filaments and in the process of star formation.
We provide a first application of FilDReaMS, the new method to detect and
analyze filaments. Our goal is to investigate the relative orientations between
the detected filaments and the magnetic field. We apply FilDReaMS to a sample
of four Herschel fields (G210, G300, G82, G202) characterized by different
Galactic environments and evolutionary stages. First, we examine the networks
formed by filaments of different bar widths as well as their hierarchical
organization. Second, we compare the filament orientations to the magnetic
field orientation inferred from Planck polarization data and, for the first
time, we study the statistics of the relative orientation angle as functions of
both spatial scale and ${\rm H_2}$ column density. We find preferential
relative orientations in the four Herschel fields: small filaments with low
column densities are slightly more parallel than perpendicular to the magnetic
field, while large filaments (higher column densities) are oriented nearly
perpendicular (or, in the case of G202, nearly parallel). In the two nearby
fields (G210 and G300), we observe a transition from mostly parallel to mostly
perpendicular at an $N_{\rm H_2} \simeq 1.1$ and $1.4\times10^{21}\,$cm$^{-2}$,
respectively, consistent with the results of previous studies. Our results
confirm the existence of a coupling between magnetic fields at cloud scales and
filaments at smaller scale. They also illustrate the potential of combining
Herschel and Planck observations, and they call for further statistical

that the moir\'e potentials alter the band structure of graphene, resulting in
a redshift of the intralayer transition at the M-point, which becomes more

of the Brillouin zone of h-BN relative to the graphene M-point leads to tunable

rewards the individuals that are significant to group activity, while HAP

learning a static NeRF in the canonical space is not enough because the
lighting of the body changes when the person moves even though the scene
lighting is constant. Previous methods alleviate the inconsistency of lighting
by learning a per-frame embedding, but this operation does not generalize to
unseen poses. Given that the lighting condition is static in the world space
while the human body is consistent in the canonical space, we propose a
dual-space NeRF that models the scene lighting and the human body with two MLPs
in two separate spaces. To bridge these two spaces, previous methods mostly
rely on the linear blend skinning (LBS) algorithm. However, the blending
weights for LBS of a dynamic neural field are intractable and thus are usually
memorized with another MLP, which does not generalize to novel poses. Although
it is possible to borrow the blending weights of a parametric mesh such as
SMPL, the interpolation operation introduces more artifacts. In this paper, we
propose to use the barycentric mapping, which can directly generalize to unseen
poses and surprisingly achieves superior results than LBS with neural blending
weights. Quantitative and qualitative results on the Human3.6M and the

observe the influence of disease mortality on individuals' spatial

benefits the species, abandoning refuges provided by safeguarding social

reliability in real-world applications. Existing attempts towards solving this
problem are heuristic, and the robustness to model changes of the resulting
CFXs is evaluated with only a small number of retrained models, failing to
provide exhaustive guarantees. To remedy this, we propose {\Delta}-robustness,
the first notion to formally and deterministically assess the robustness (to
model changes) of CFXs for neural networks. We introduce an abstraction
framework based on interval neural networks to verify the {\Delta}-robustness
of CFXs against a possibly infinite set of changes to the model parameters,

two distinct ways. First, we analyse the {\Delta}-robustness of a number of CFX
generation methods from the literature and show that they unanimously host
significant deficiencies in this regard. Second, we demonstrate how embedding
{\Delta}-robustness within existing methods can provide CFXs which are provably

a plenitude of neutrino experimental observations. Given the fact that we are
approaching precession era in the neutrino sector, the quest has now shifted
towards probing several sub-dominant effects such as non-standard interactions
(NSI) and neutrino decay. In principle, both of these effects can coexist at
the high energy new physics scale but usually they are analyzed one at a time.
In this work, we study the imprints of possible neutrino decay on the
phenomenon of neutrino oscillations in the presence of NSI for various
experimental set-ups related to atmospheric, accelerator and reactor neutrinos.
Using the current experimental bounds on NSI and neutrino decay parameters, we
find that the effects of decay are inconsequential in the case of atmospheric
neutrinos. For accelerator experiment T2K, the effect is frivolous whereas
there is only a marginal deviation for MINOS and DUNE experimental set-ups.
However, the divagations are significant enough for KamLAND, JUNO and Daya Bay
reactor experiments to show observational effects. Therefore the presence of
neutrino decay can alter the bounds on NSI parameters obtained from reactor
experiments.

(TSG), which aims to accurately determine the specific video segment in an
untrimmed video according to a given sentence query. Traditional TSG methods
mainly follow the top-down or bottom-up framework and are not end-to-end. They
severely rely on time-consuming post-processing to refine the grounding
results. Recently, some transformer-based approaches are proposed to
efficiently and effectively model the fine-grained semantic alignment between
video and query. Although these methods achieve significant performance to some
extent, they equally take frames of the video and words of the query as
transformer input for correlating, failing to capture their different levels of
granularity with distinct semantics. To address this issue, in this paper, we
propose a novel Hierarchical Local-Global Transformer (HLGT) to leverage this
hierarchy information and model the interactions between different levels of
granularity and different modalities for learning more fine-grained multi-modal
representations. Specifically, we first split the video and query into
individual clips and phrases to learn their local context (adjacent dependency)
and global correlation (long-range dependency) via a temporal transformer.
Then, a global-local transformer is introduced to learn the interactions
between the local-level and global-level semantics for better multi-modal
reasoning. Besides, we develop a new cross-modal cycle-consistency loss to
enforce interaction between two modalities and encourage the semantic alignment
between them. Finally, we design a brand-new cross-modal parallel transformer
decoder to integrate the encoded visual and textual features for final
grounding. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets show that our
proposed HLGT achieves a new state-of-the-art performance.

learning due to the requirement of economical storage and efficiency of binary
codes. It aims to encode high-dimensional features in the Hamming space with
similarity preservation between instances. However, most existing methods learn
hash functions in manifold-based approaches. Those methods capture the local
geometric structures (i.e., pairwise relationships) of data, and lack
satisfactory performance in dealing with real-world scenarios that produce
similar features (e.g. color and shape) with different semantic information. To
address this challenge, in this work, we propose an effective unsupervised
method, namely Jointly Personalized Sparse Hashing (JPSH), for binary
representation learning. To be specific, firstly, we propose a novel
personalized hashing module, i.e., Personalized Sparse Hashing (PSH). Different
personalized subspaces are constructed to reflect category-specific attributes
for different clusters, adaptively mapping instances within the same cluster to
the same Hamming space. In addition, we deploy sparse constraints for different
personalized subspaces to select important features. We also collect the
strengths of the other clusters to build the PSH module with avoiding
over-fitting. Then, to simultaneously preserve semantic and pairwise
similarities in our JPSH, we incorporate the PSH and manifold-based hash
learning into the seamless formulation. As such, JPSH not only distinguishes
the instances from different clusters, but also preserves local neighborhood
structures within the cluster. Finally, an alternating optimization algorithm
is adopted to iteratively capture analytical solutions of the JPSH model.
Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify that the JPSH
outperforms several hashing algorithms on the similarity search task.

images are available during model adaptation. However, this assumption is often

these problems, we propose a novel source-free UDA method that uses only a

aleatoric uncertainty by incorporating data augmentation and trains the feature
generator with two consistency objectives. The feature generator is encouraged
to learn consistent visual features away from the decision boundaries of the
head classifier. Thus, the adapted model becomes more robust to image
perturbations. Inspired by self-supervised learning, our method promotes
inter-space alignment between the prediction space and the feature space while
incorporating intra-space consistency within the feature space to reduce the
domain gap between the source and target domains. We also consider epistemic
uncertainty to boost the model adaptation performance. Extensive experiments on
popular UDA benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed source-free method
is comparable or even superior to vanilla UDA methods. Moreover, the adapted

truly-unsupervised methods adopt clustering approaches to easily provide
per-sample one-hot domain labels. However, they cannot account for the

semantics of the clusters are not easily coupled to the human understanding. To
overcome these, we present a LANguage-driven Image-to-image Translation model,

for a dataset: the similarity between images and attributes indicates
per-sample domain labels. This formulation naturally enables multi-hot label so
that users can specify the target domain with a set of attributes in language.
To account for the case that the initial prompts are inaccurate, we also
present prompt learning. We further present domain regularization loss that
enforces translated images be mapped to the corresponding domain. Experiments

present here a frequency domain model that describes the effect of angular
motion of all three spacecraft on the interferometric signals after propagating
through TDI. We then apply a Fisher information matrix analysis to this model
to calculate the minimum uncertainty with which TTL coupling coefficients may
be estimated. Furthermore, we show the impact of these uncertainties on the
residual TTL noise in the gravitational wave readout channel, and compare it to
the impact of the angular witness sensors' readout noise. We show that the
residual TTL noise post-subtraction in the TDI variables for a case using the
LISA angular jitter requirement and integration time of one day is limited to
the 8\,pm/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ level by angular sensing noise. However, using a more
realistic model for the angular jitter we find that the TTL coupling

images were generated using a digital brain phantom and their noise level was
varied using the X-ray exposure noise model with different exposures (15, 30,
50, 75, and 100 mAs). Cerebral blood flow (CBF) images were generated from the
original contrast enhancement (CE) images and those obtained by the DIP and TV
methods using block-circulant singular value decomposition. The quality of the
CE images was evaluated using the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and
structural similarity index (SSIM). To compare the CBF images obtained by the
different methods and those generated from the ground truth images, linear
regression analysis was performed. When using the DIP method, the PSNR and SSIM
were not significantly dependent on the exposure, and the SSIM was the highest
for all exposures. When using the TV methods, they were significantly dependent
on the exposure and alpha values. The results of the linear regression analysis
suggested that the linearity of the CBF images obtained by the DIP method was
superior to those obtained from the original CE images and by the TV methods.
Our preliminary results suggest that the DIP method is useful for denoising

the solution of a minimization problem over the so-called vertex-packing
polytope.
  In this paper we generalize this notion to graphons. We show that the
analogous minimization problem provides an upper bound for graphon entropy. We
also give a lower bound in the shape of a maximization problem. The main result
of the paper is that for most graphons these two bounds actually coincide and
hence precisely determine the entropy in question. Furthermore, graphon entropy
has a nice connection to the fractional chromatic number and the fractional
clique number (defined for graphons by Hladk\'y and Rocha).

prime targets for studying the launching of jets by objects with a solid
surface; while classical jet-launching models predict that such NSs cannot
launch jets, recent observations and models argue otherwise. Transient Be/X-ray
binaries (BeXRBs) are critical laboratories for probing this poorly-explored
parameter space for jet formation. Here, we present the coordinated monitoring
campaigns of three BeXRBs across four outbursts: giant outbursts of SAX
2103.5+4545, 1A 0535+262, and GRO J1008-57, as well as a Type-I outburst of the
latter. We obtain radio detections of 1A 0535+262 during ten out of twenty
observations, while the other targets remained undetected at typical limits of
$20$-$50$ $\mu$Jy. The radio luminosity of 1A 0535+262 positively correlates
with its evolving X-ray luminosity, and inhabits a region of the $L_X$-$L_R$
plane continuing the correlation observed previously for the BeXRB Swift
J0243.6+6124. We measure a BeXRB $L_X$-$L_R$ coupling index of $\beta = 0.86
\pm 0.06$ ($L_R \propto L_X^\beta$), similar to the indices measured in NS and
black hole low-mass X-ray binaries. Strikingly, the coupling's $L_R$
normalisation is $\sim 275$ and $\sim 6.2\times10^3$ times lower than in those
two comparison samples, respectively. We conclude that jet emission likely
dominates during the main peak of giant outbursts, but is only detectable for
close-by or super-Eddington systems at current radio sensitivities. We discuss
these results in the broader context of X-ray binary radio studies, concluding
that our results suggest how supergiant X-ray binaries may host a currently
unidentified additional radio emission mechanism.

analyses of the Unitarity Triangle that are needed for the Standard Model
predictions of the $B_q$ mixing parameters. In particular, we explore the
impact of tensions between inclusive and exclusive determinations of the CKM

$B\to\pi\pi$, $\rho\pi$, $\rho\rho$ decays, where the latter are typically
interpreted in terms of the angle $\alpha$. We discuss various scenarios and
present the corresponding state-of-the-art constraints on the New Physics

results in a key limiting factor. By contrast, the corresponding impact is
negligible for the $B_s$ system, making it a promising candidate to reveal

particles[1-3] and particle-like field configurations[4-13] that appear in
almost all branches of physics ranging from subatomic to cosmological
scales[3,14-16]. In this context, formation and annihilation of particles
corresponds to topological phase transitions, whose actual process and
mechanism remain elusive. Here, we show that annihilation of an isolated
skyrmion in helimagnets as the applied magnetic field increases initiates at
its center point by a local magnetization reversal. At the critical field, a
soft mode of the spin-wave excitation appears, which vanishes the local
magnetization modulus as well as the soft-mode-modulated emergent elastic
stiffness[17] at the center, which makes it an emergent magnetic monopole[6].
This softened point vanishes the energy barrier of reversing the local
magnetization at the center, which inevitably annihilates the skyrmion. On this
basis, we propose a general critical condition for topological phase
transitions of field solutions with a soft mode: topological phase transitions
initiate at those spatial points where the soft-mode-modulated emergent

limit of grazing collisions. This has been proved rigorously for certain
families of Boltzmann operators concentrating on grazing collisions. In this
contribution, we study the collision kernels associated to the two-particle
scattering via a finite range potential $\Phi(x)$ in three dimensions. We then
consider the limit of weak interaction given by $\Phi_\epsilon(x) = \epsilon
\Phi(x)$. Here $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$ is the grazing parameter, and the rate
of collisions is rescaled to obtain a non-trivial limit. The grazing collisions
limit is of particular interest for potentials with a singularity of order
$s\geq 0$ at the origin, i.e. $\phi(x) \sim |x|^{-s}$ as $|x|\rightarrow 0$.
For $s\in [0,1]$, we prove the convergence to the Landau equation with
diffusion coefficient given by the Born approximation, as predicted in the
works of Landau and Balescu. On the other hand, for potentials with $s>1$ we
obtain the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation in the limit. The Coulomb singularity
$s=1$ appears as a threshold value with a logarithmic correction to the
diffusive timescale, the so-called Coulomb logarithm.

recurrent structures are present and naturally handles multivariate time series

dissociative recombination (DR) of CH$^+$. Using an electron-ion merged-beams
experiment at the Cryogenic Storage Ring, we have determined the DR rate
coefficient of the CH$^+$ electronic, vibrational, and rotational ground state
applicable for different diffuse cloud conditions. Our results reduce the
previously unrecognized order-of-magnitude uncertainty in the CH$^+$ DR rate
coefficient to $\sim \pm 20\%$ and are applicable at all temperatures relevant
to diffuse clouds, ranging from quiescent gas to gas locally heated by
processes such as shocks and turbulence. Based on a simple chemical network, we
find that DR can be an important destruction mechanism at temperatures relevant
to quiescent gas. As the temperature increases locally, DR can continue to be
important up to temperatures of $ \sim 600\,\mathrm{K} $ if there is also a
corresponding increase in the electron fraction of the gas. Our new CH$^+$ DR
rate coefficient data will increase the reliability of future studies of
diffuse cloud physical properties via CH$^+$ abundance observations.

most real-world scenarios, drawing domain knowledge from raw observations is
complex and tedious. If the cell partitioning is not informative enough,
Go-Explore can completely fail to explore the environment. We argue that the
Go-Explore approach can be generalized to any environment without domain
knowledge and without cells by exploiting a learned latent representation.
Thus, we show that LGE can be flexibly combined with any strategy for learning
a latent representation. Our results indicate that LGE, although simpler than
Go-Explore, is more robust and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms

Supernovae have little impact on cluster properties. We find that in our high
density, high gas mass simulations, star formation is less affected by
feedback, as star formation occurs rapidly before feedback has much impact. In
our lowest gas density simulation, the resulting clusters are completely
different (e.g. the number of clusters and their masses) to the case with no
feedback. The star formation rate is also significantly suppressed. The
fraction of stars in clusters in this model decreases with time flattening at
about 20\%. In our lowest gas simulation model, we see the formation of a star
forming group with properties similar to an OB association, in particular
similar to Orion Ia. We suggest that low densities, and stronger initial
dynamics are conducive to forming associations rather than clusters. In all
models cluster formation is complex with clusters merging and splitting. The
most massive clusters which form have tended to undergo more mergers.

the detection by distinguishing the AE's abnormal relation with its augmented

label consistency. An off-the-shelf Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) model is
used to extract the representation and predict the label for its highly
informative representation capacity compared to supervised learning models. For
clean samples, their representations and predictions are closely consistent
with their neighbors, whereas those of AEs differ greatly. Furthermore, we
explain this observation and show that by leveraging this discrepancy BEYOND

easily cooperate with the Adversarial Trained Classifier (ATC), achieving the

novel deep learning approach for group activity recognition (GAR) in team
sports called NETS. To efficiently model the player relations in team sports,
we combined a Transformer-based architecture with LSTM embedding, and a
team-wise pooling layer to recognize the group activity. Training such a neural
network generally requires a large amount of annotated data, which incurs high
labeling cost. To address scarcity of manual labels, we generate weak-labels
and pretrain the neural network on a self-supervised trajectory prediction
task. We used a large tracking data set from 632 NBA games to evaluate our
approach. The results show that NETS is capable of learning group activities
with high accuracy, and that self- and weak-supervised training in NETS have a
positive impact on GAR accuracy.

an exceptional solution to the KGE and DE with a finite value of the field

transformations of internal symmetry intermixing their components. Under

most useful in applications where data is scarce and noisy, and monotonicity is

approaches assign labels to unlabeled data before re-training the model with a

severely degraded by noise and are prone to over-fitting to noisy labels, due
to the inclusion of erroneous high confidence pseudo-labels generated from
poorly calibrated models, thus, rendering threshold-based selection
ineffective. Moreover, the combinatorial complexity of the hypothesis space and
the error accumulation due to multiple incorrect autoregressive steps posit
pseudo-labeling challenging for sequence models. To this end, we propose a
pseudo-label generation and an uncertainty-based data selection framework for
semi-supervised text recognition. We first use Beam-Search inference to yield
highly probable hypotheses to assign pseudo-labels to the unlabelled examples.
Then we adopt an ensemble of models, sampled by applying dropout, to obtain a
robust estimate of the uncertainty associated with the prediction, considering
both the character-level and word-level predictive distribution to select good

usually have no way of knowing whether participants should trust the model.

filters are widely used for automatic modulation classification (AMC). In this
report, we find some experienced improvements by using large kernel size for
convolutional deep convolution neural network based AMC, which is more
efficient in extracting multi-scale features of the raw signal I/Q sequence
data. Also, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) mechanisms can significantly help AMC
networks to focus on the more important features of the signal. As a result, we
propose a multi-scale feature network with large kernel size and SE mechanism
(SE-MSFN) in this paper. SE-MSFN achieves state-of-the-art classification
performance on the public well-known RADIOML 2018.01A dataset, with average
classification accuracy of 64.50%, surpassing CLDNN by 1.42%, maximum
classification accuracy of 98.5%, and an average classification accuracy of
85.53% in the lower SNR range 0dB to 10dB, surpassing CLDNN by 2.85%. In
addition, we also verified that ensemble learning can help further improve
classification performance. We hope this report can provide some references for

potential complications such as model misspecification, unmeasured confounding,
different sample sizes of current treatment groups, and heterogeneity among the
three trials. We evaluate two frequentist methods (with both Cox and Weibull
accelerated failure time [AFT] models) and three different priors in Bayesian
dynamic borrowing (with a Weibull AFT model), and modifications within each of
those, when estimating the effect of treatment on survival outcomes and
measures of effect such as marginal hazard ratios. We assess the performance of
these methods in different settings and potential of generalizations to
supplement decisions in early-phase oncology trials. The results show that the
proposed joint frequentist methods and noninformative priors within Bayesian
dynamic borrowing with no adjustment on covariates are preferred, especially
when treatment effects across the three trials are heterogeneous. For
generalization of hybrid control methods in such settings we recommend more
simulation studies.

  Normal Chest X-Rays",,,,,"eess.IV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for medical diagnosis require
thorough evaluation to demonstrate that performance is maintained for all
patient sub-groups and to ensure that proposed improvements in care will be
delivered equitably. This study evaluates the robustness of an AI solution for
the diagnosis of normal chest X-rays (CXRs) by comparing performance across
multiple patient and environmental subgroups, as well as comparing AI errors
with those made by human experts.
  Methods: A total of 4,060 CXRs were sampled to represent a diverse dataset of
NHS patients and care settings. Ground-truth labels were assigned by a
3-radiologist panel. AI performance was evaluated against assigned labels and
sub-groups analysis was conducted against patient age and sex, as well as CXR
view, modality, device manufacturer and hospital site.
  Results: The AI solution was able to remove 18.5% of the dataset by
classification as High Confidence Normal (HCN). This was associated with a
negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.0%, compared to 89.1% for diagnosis of
normal scans by radiologists. In all AI false negative (FN) cases, a
radiologist was found to have also made the same error when compared to final
ground-truth labels. Subgroup analysis showed no statistically significant
variations in AI performance, whilst reduced normal classification was observed
in data from some hospital sites.
  Conclusion: We show the AI solution could provide meaningful workload savings
by diagnosis of 18.5% of scans as HCN with a superior NPV to human readers. The
AI solution is shown to perform well across patient subgroups and error cases
were shown to be subjective or subtle in nature.

(documents, images, etc) with appropriate taxonomic classes. The flexible
nature of zero-shot learning is appealing for this task because it allows
classifiers to naturally adapt to taxonomy modifications. This work studies
zero-shot multi-label document classification with fine-tuned language models
under realistic taxonomy expansion scenarios in the human resource domain.
Experiments show that zero-shot learning can be highly effective in this
setting. When controlling for training data budget, zero-shot classifiers
achieve a 12% relative increase in macro-AP when compared to a traditional
multi-label classifier trained on all classes. Counterintuitively, these
results suggest in some settings it would be preferable to adopt zero-shot
techniques and spend resources annotating more documents with an incomplete set
of classes, rather than spreading the labeling budget uniformly over all
classes and using traditional classification techniques. Additional experiments
demonstrate that adopting the well-known filter/re-rank decomposition from the
recommender systems literature can significantly reduce the computational
burden of high-performance zero-shot classifiers, empirically resulting in a
98% reduction in computational overhead for only a 2% relative decrease in
performance. The evidence presented here demonstrates that zero-shot learning
has the potential to significantly increase the flexibility of taxonomies and
highlights directions for future research.

discussion, as optimized power settings can help reduce interference and
improve the quality of service to users. Recently, machine learning (ML)-based,
especially reinforcement learning (RL)-based control methods have received much
attention. However, there is little discussion about the generalisation ability
of the trained RL models. This paper points out that an RL agent trained in a
specific indoor environment is room-dependent, and cannot directly serve new
heterogeneous environments. Therefore, in the context of Open Radio Access
Network (O-RAN), this paper proposes a distributed cell power-control scheme
based on Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL). Models in different indoor
environments are aggregated to the global model during the training process,
and then the central server broadcasts the updated model back to each client.
The model will also be used as the base model for adaptive training in the new
environment. The simulation results show that the FRL model has similar
performance to a single RL agent, and both are better than the random power
allocation method and exhaustive search method. The results of the
generalisation test show that using the FRL model as the base model improves
the convergence speed of the model in the new environment.

waveguides, metalenses, X-ray wavefront sensors, detectors, microstructures and
arrays of Si pillars are used as bio-interfaces in neural activity recording,

a new strategy for realizing arrays of protruding sharp Si nanopillars using
displacement Talbot lithography combined with metal-assisted chemical etching
(MacEtch) in gas phase. With the double exposure of a linear grating mask in
orthogonal orientations and the lift-off technique, we realized a catalyst
pattern of holes in a Pt thin film with a period of 1 {\mu}m and hole diameter
in the range of 100-250 nm. MacEtch in gas phase by using vapor HF and oxygen
from air allows to etch arrays of protruding Si nanopillars 200 nm-thick and
aspect ratio in the range of 200 (pillar height/width) with an etching rate up
to 1 {\mu}m/min. With the advantage of no stiction, no ion beam damage of the
Si substrate, nanometric resolution and high fidelity of pattern transfer the
method is an easy-to-scale-up processing that can support the fabrication of Si
pillars arrays for many valuable applications both at micro and nano-scale.

objects with multiple robots to goal regions in the presence of other movable

adopt intelligent collaboration strategies, i.e., decide which robot should
move which objects to which positions, and perform collaborative actions, such
as handovers. To endow robots with these collaboration capabilities, we propose
to first collect occlusion and reachability information for each robot as well
as information about whether two robots can perform a handover action by
calling motion-planning algorithms. We then propose a method that uses the
collected information to build a graph structure which captures the precedence
of the manipulations of different objects and supports the implementation of a
mixed-integer program to guide the search for highly effective collaborative
task-and-motion plans. The search process for collaborative task-and-motion
plans is based on a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) exploration strategy to
achieve exploration-exploitation balance. We evaluate our framework in two

length and the number of objects moved compared to two state-of-the-art
